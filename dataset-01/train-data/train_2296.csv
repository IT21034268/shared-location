3,TEDIOUS,"When a video game stops being entertaining, and becomes tedious its no longer any good. This is the case with Mafia. Sure it has the graphics of Max Payne, with the feel of GTA3 and a great story line, however its just about as fun as a tax audit. Mafia fails to deliver in every category exept the feeling of absolute displeasure at having to constantly repeat the same mundain task over and over and over and over again. Boring. A perfect example of this is the racing sequence, at the track early in the game. I assure you, this part of the game will leave you pulling your hair out in disgust. This game could have been great, sadly it comes up way short."
3,1930s Knock-Off of GTA3,"The creators of Mafia seem to think they can take GTA3, dress the main character up in a pin-stripe suit, and call it something new.Game developers spend lots of money on graphics and sound, and devote very little attention to plot, dialogue, and acting. Why do we see so many games, like this one, with state-of-the-art visuals trying to breathe life into a bland script that could well have been written by some high-school kid in the after-school creative writing club? The sensory aspects of action games keep improving over time, but the creative aspect has totally been left behind."
4,Dizzying Game,"I had fun playing this game, as it is addictive. it mainly includes driving different cars, shooting, and some searching for object, but when moving upand down the staris or around corridors, when your back is against the wall, the camer azooms front then zooms out, this is sort of mind aerobics, and makes you feel dizzy.Aside from that it is a very involving and a first-class game."
5,Wow Its Awful,"I got this wonderful game last month. I have never seen such a nice game. This is a much differrent game from the others in the market. Normally if you buy a game it would be either action or racing or something else only. But this game has everything. Like drive your car, get out of it and slam a guy with your baseball bat or shoot the guy. You get many weapons to play with. We really feel like as we are a gangster. Every body in Sri Lanka LOVES it. And mostly I JUST LOVE IT... YOU MUST TRY IT TO FEEL IT. I would give all my 5 stars for this game."
3,Mafia is good but glitchy,"Mafia is a good fps, but it is somewhat glitchy, slow, and rigid. As i have seen it compared to GTA 3, i think people are crazy! GTA3 is better. But for 10 bucks Mafia is worth the money."
5,Best game yet!,"This is by far the BEST computer game I have ever played. Other notable shooter games like ""Max Payne"" and ""Castle Wolfenstein"" do not hold a candle! Lets see: to begin with, there is a good story line exhibited through frequent cut scenes which keep you interested in the characters long after the novelty of a new game wares off. The graphics are outstanding and the overal visual palette has such style. The opening introduction scene blew me away when I first viewed it. I realised immediately that this was the beginning of a new generation of games. The game comes to a crescendo with absolutely stunning visuals in the last mission.The sound is also as good as it gets. The variaty of missions and the distribution between driving and shooting missions break up the monotony of any shooting game and complement eachother. What can I say; I LOVED THIS GAME and was sorry to see it come to an end. I would love a sequel."
4,Good game... but challenging,Mafia is a good game very similiar to Grand Theft Auto games. It has a decent story to it you work for the mafia as a hitman and whatever else they want you to do (mostly their dirty work). It is a fun game and can be very enjoyable at times My big problem with the game is it involves a lot of trial and error which can be extremely frustrating. Some of the missions in the game are pretty damn hard and you can get stuck on for hours some for days and the fact that you have to repeat them over and over til you complete them right can be very boring and annoying after a while. The game does not have a quick save but to its benefit it has autosaves(checkpoints basically) at certain points during missions. The price of this game is $10 nowadays making it well worth it to buy and check out.
5,GREEEAT,"Ive become addicted ever since I got this game. Whoever says this game is awful is full of B.S. It is a bigger world (and) better than GTAIII, better graphics (anyone who says the game is choppy has a computer from the 70's). I got my comp. 3 years ago, I run the game from an external drive on highest settings and it is smooth. The driving is also a bonus. Hey, you dont have to drive even, the subway and trolly are always an option, and you can actually see through the windows while riding (unlike GTA III). Yes, it is a mix between max payne and gta III, but is better than each. GET THIS GAME!!! It is well worth the money!!! also check out partysnaps.8k.com !"
5,This game is too short,Whats up man... I finished this game in less than 2 weeks!!. You know that this game is different than any other games and is very interresting. But it is too short and easy.This game does not have a good story. At the end of this game everybody in the team dies. I would have liked it if Tommy lives with his friends Sam + Paulie working for Saliery. You feel really bad when you shoot Sam who was your best friend. You save him in earlier missions and now you shoot him down.I would have loved this game if it was a little longer and had more missions to play with. 20 missions on a interesting game like this is always not enough. I am waiting for Mafia 2.
1,"A Great Idea, But Disappointing Execution","The best part about this book is the premise: the idea of a machine that can grab images from the past. It's commendable that the author provides a logically consistent realization of this machine. Unfortunately, a good idea and scientific accuracy alone do not make a good book.The characters are shallow, the plot thin, and the writing style atrocious. The small blurbs before each chapter were painful to read, and I struggled to get through this book. I like to see a book to the end before I judge it, particularly with science fiction, but I put this book down several times and hesitated each time to pick it back up again.I originally purchased this novel because it was referenced in the show ""Lost"", and I thought it might provide insight into the show itself (but it did not).I would love to see the author take his idea to a more talented writer and work it into something with a little more substance."
1,Uuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhh.......No,"OK, I love bands such as Muse, Starsailor, Radiohead, Travis, and Frou Frou. That being said, I came across this album because someone recommended it instead of a Travis album. This band is terrible. The guy's voice is like a mix of Billy Corgan, and the Counting Crows guy. Almost like a male Ani Difranco, I can't stand her either, but to say the least... Uhhhhh...No"
3,No reason not to get the 20%,I used this to whiten my teeth fast in preparation for dental work. It worked but with a price. I used the custom trays but still my gums were red and irritated. The dentist was satisfied with the whitening but ended up prescribing a mouthwash designed to heal my gums (at $18 a pop that was an ouch.) The 20% is better.
2,Cannot rave about this,I did not see the noticeable lift I was looking for and I did find an uncomfortable sensitivity in my teeth after use.
3,teeth whitening,"I purchased this product specifically for my two bottom front teeth which are not a white as my other teeth. I used the product with professional dental trays, three separate occasions for 1 hour, every other day and noticed they were slightly lighter. Be careful not to use too much product in your dental trays (a MUST) as it will leak out onto your gums and your gums will become white and SENSITIVE. I would recommend this product with extreme caution to follow the directions specifically! I would have given 4-5 stars my two bottom teeth had reached my desired color wthin the three uses. (Yes, I do use a straw for all my beverages.)"
1,Did not work,"My dentist took impressions and made custom trays. I started out with 10% with no results and ending up using 35% for three months. No change. Then my dentist did an in-office whitening treatment (only charging for materials), still no results. I hope this works better for other folks as I wasted $500."
1,"No, no, and no.","I have used Opalescence before, but never 35%. My gums were sooo tender after only 4 hours of use and never with the lesser concentrations. I could barely brush my teeth for fear of hitting my gums. For 4 days after using!! It tore them up!! (some had gotten on my gums when I initially put the trays in and I wiped it off but still........)"
1,Don't buy it online!!,"I've used this product before after purchasing it from my dentist office, this time I purchased it online and it was not the same. It burned my gums and my throat. I would stick to buying it from a dental office."
5,Quick Results!,"First, I am pleased to report that while a couple of the reviewers mentioned a burning sensation from this product, I did not.I have always used Opalescence 15%, but there is a distinct acceleration in the efficacy of Opalescence 35%. I had for years gotten the 15% product directly from the dentist who had made my molds. So, I was happy to find that Amazon carried a higher concentration of this product with a much lower time requirement for results.To think ~ I used to wear my mouth molds overnight! With this concentration level though, as long as you're not particularly sensitive, you are only supposed to wear them for 1/2 an hour. That's a step in the right direction! With Oplaescence 35% I saw distinct whitening improvement after only two uses."
5,Awesome!,"I love Opalescence. I have used the whitening gel for over a year, and have loved it. I had been using the 22% and it worked great, but the 35% took my tooth whitening to a new level! WOW! I must get 4 or 5 complimets PER DAY on my white smile. Thanks Opallescence and Aplussmile!"
2,To strong,"I've used the 15% solution for a year and bought the 35% solution thinking it would take less time to whiten my teeth. I ccould keep the 15% solution in overnight. I kept the 35% solution for 45 minutes and that's because I forced myself, it was actually painful. My gums and teeth hurt for several days and I haven't used it since. It even bleached my gums around my front teeth. My gums cleared up in 2 days. Everytime I hit my gum while brushing for the next 2 days it bled. I would purchase again but only the 20% solution."
2,Great Whitening Results But Not Worth the Pain!,"I had my custom trays made by my dentist & was given the 15% Opelescence. It whitened and brightened my teeth after only 4 days but my teeth ached from the sensitivity for days on end! (I have always had sensitive teeth.) I couldn't continue using the product. If you don't have sensitive teeth, this is the best whitening gel on the market but you MUST get custom trays from your dentist that fit properly. A good tip is to store the gel in the refrigerator. It keeps the gel's whitening concentration from depleting and the syringes will be good for at least a year."
5,Great Product,the product is great and really works on whiting your teeth . Price wise much cheaper to purchase through you than your dentist
4,Works good but be careful,"So depending on how sensitive you are, be careful when you order any Opalescence kit. I went from the 20% to this, and this is borderline too strong. I felt it burning my gums a bit and only left it on for 30 minutes. The plus side, is it does work a lot better. So if you can deal with the tingle, it's worth it!"
5,Tooth whitner works,I received the whitner within a few days of ordering. The product is the same as I purchased in the past from my dentist. This is a good deal.
5,Fantastic bipod!,It's a great bipod. Attaches to the little sling base on your rifle. Does everything it is advertised to do and is a hardy little guy. I would trust it to hold up to most rifle calibers. Folds up neatly for storage too.I shoot it without a rear bag and find it stable.
2,BCM AR15 owner,"I received the shipment today, but was disappointed to find out that one of the telescoping legs could not lock into place when I pulled it out completely. Some one at Harris engineering, could have easily caught this defect before shipping it out. Bad quality control."
3,Reinforces your knowledge,The purpose of the casebook is to reinforce your theoretical knowledge of finances. That is perfectly fulfilled. I have bought it as suplement to regular textbook. That is in my oppinion the best way of using it. I can recommend it to anyone who is not already significantly experienced.
2,Not So Good,"Like the movie, not nearly as good as the first one. If you're in to puzzle solving more than killing and monsters, this is not the game for you. Volume II is easy, way to short (took me about a day to finish), not very scarry, and pretty predictable. I think there are more cinemagraphic sequences than actual playing! I played Volume I and absolutely loved it. After playing Volume II, I'm debating on whether or not to spend the money on Volume III. If you're really into the whole Blair Witch thing, it might be worth it. If you're looking for a good puzzle game, try something else."
3,"Scary, interesting, but thin","Blair Witch volume II is scarier than the first game, but it is much shorter and a little easier. You don't have to go back into the woods often as you did in Volume I. In this chapter, you remain in the woods the entire time. And, as an added plus, you can turn off the violence, which is very nice. The ending is a little strange and vague, but you will have quite a few scares along the way."
3,A GAME THAT MISSES ON THE STORIES POTENTIAL,"I have played all 3 volumes of blairwitch and find this game the most dissapointing of the three.the game is very short and easy and has no replay value.though it has its scary moments,its just another horror game on the block.the story had too much potential to even make it an all time hit but it seems the game was made in a real hurry and the result is for all of us to see.i would still suggest u buy it if u have already bought the other two episodes.just enjoy the game and dont expect too much out of it."
2,blair witch game,"I would have liked the game I'm sure, but would not work on my PC. It said I didn't have the right code for download. Waste of money since I can't play it.!"
1,There's a hole in it!,"I received the cover last week and used it a total of THREE times before I noticed a 5-inch hole along the seam.I don't know if it came damaged or it happened on its own.I didn't pull at the cover or anything since the covers big for my bike there was no need to.It stayed true to being waterproof (withheld through heavy fog/light drizzle), but I can't believe it ripped already!!"
4,Good but thin,Great cover! The large fit my Ninja 650R perfectly. Seems a bit thin but has a warranty. A bit of a delay (couple of days) with recieving this item.
5,Sounds like a death rattle....,"I was already turned on to Nick Lowe from Labour of Lust and Pure Pop/Jesus of Cool. Of course, the foray into the works of other artists and bands, in which Nick had active and/or behind the scenes impact, created a large and diverse section of my old LP collection. When Nick the Knife came out, the band was different, the sound was different, the lyrics were classic and edgy Lowe. I purchased a new German import of the album and was enchanted. The songs have pop-hooks for the most part, but they are still unique and, to me, are hard to categorize. My favorite Lowe song of all time is ""My Heart Hurts"" on this record. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers for this and other Lowe records that he has become somewhat blue and morose, so I have to admit I'm partial to the ""First Half"" ouvre."
5,Nick rocks you!,"When I heard him on the radio the first time way back in the 80's he rocked me!Unfortunately he is not often on the radio anyway (I had luck)He was called ""Thief Of The Century"" - that was right and wrong.No one did it so well as Nick. Both his early uptempo-rocksongs and his recent more balladesque ones are great. I went 300 miles to attend one of his rare concerts - go and get his records, its much cheaper ;-)"
3,Does not work on NT 4.0,"Beware that this modem does not have drivers for NT 4.0. It does come with software for Win 95, Win 98, and Win 2000. I can't really rate it because I wasn't able to get it working on my NT laptop."
2,3Com 56K Xjack modem Model.3056,"very good - while it lasts. Bought 2 during past 2 years, each lasted approx. 6 months before breaking down/"
1,2-way switch - not a dimmer,"It's a serviceable lamp for the office, but I was very disappointed that it turned out to be a (cheap) 2-way switch not a ""dimmer"" switch. I would have ordered their 3-way switch lamp in black which would have matched my office furniture."
5,Great Buy,"I have purchased other 300 w Halogen lamps and this is better than my others. I have not had to remove the protective shield to change a bulb but it will be much easier than the shields on my other lamps. It also looks a little ""classier"" than my others.I am a 78 year, female senior, and I had absolutely no problem assembling it. I would not hesitate to buy another from this vendor."
4,Easy to learn & FUN!,"This program makes it so easy to learn sign language. They also have fun games in the program to help you to remember more. This is a good program, easy to use, and is full of fun learning. This products not only for kids, but for beginners also."
2,Boring ASL game,"It's simply no fun. It dosen't even teach anything. The stories are boring and in the car game it says, ""Don't drive off the road!"" but you CAN'T go off the road even if you try. The stories are no fun, neither are the games. The stories are like PRESCHOOL stories and the games are too. They should of called it ""ASL for Preschoolers"". It dosen't teach very much when the person signs and the puppy suit dosen't even look good. Why it's 2 stars instead of 1 is because the car game is a tiny bit fun and the stories are a little funny. Signed, Chocolate Dog."
5,Good but is a little like listening in a wind tunnel,"I am listening as I type and for the most part the songs are great, I have found however that some of the recordings are like your in a wind tunnel. The music track is louder than the artist and on the tracks where there is happening its annoying. But a great CD"
4,A Great CD,"I agree with the review above...the cd is great, but the movie was dumb. Don't waste your money on the movie, buy the cd instead!-Lynn;-)"
4,Back In The Day,"The film ""Last Days of Disco"" opens with the Carol Douglas recording of ""Doctor's Orders"". I saw the film a couple of times and couldn't shake that song, so I bought this soundtrack. This really takes you back, but it's a fun trip. If you were around then (1975-1980), I don't have to tell you what a dream it was, especially if you lived in New Orleans or some other big city. As I remember it, responsibility was practically non-existent! If you are too young to remember, take it from me, the main object was pursuit of pleasure, pure and simple (well, not so pure.) Lots of disco standards on this disc (""I Love The Night Life"", ""More, More, More"", ""Got To Be Real"", ""Good Times"", ""Knock On Wood""), as well as some I didn't remember so well. And I must mention that Miss Ross is represented by ""I'm Coming Out"". So, if you want to go back to that fabled time, here's a pretty good place to start your journey."
5,GREAT CD!,"Still having to buy CD's because stupid record labels refuse to sell on iTunes.... Boy are they dumb, I bought this CD for the cost of 2 songs on iTunes.Beware of ""re recorded"" songs they are selling.Dumb Dumb Dumb"
1,Need Not Apply,"In her excruciating effort to outlaw the slightest discrimination, Nussbaum neglects the worst discrimination of all: that based on age. The child in the womb, the disabled infant, the elderly patient threatened by Kevorkian find no safe harbor here. And in her pleas for tolerance, the intolerance toward the religious person, especially the Roman Catholic and the Muslim, finds no censure. For all the metaphysical wallpaper, this is nothing but a tract for the politically correct dowager in Westchester."
1,Please respect...,"Sun Tzu is a respected figure even though he lived more than a thousand years ago, writing a book with an insulting title on Sun Tzu is an absolutely shameful action. Insulting others is no different to self-insulting. We respect others because we self-respect, we don't insult others because we are not in the stupidity of self-insult."
1,Another opportunist trying to sell by others' established popularity...,"Stanley Bing who? Maybe someone died some 2500 years ago by the name of Sun Tzu is better knwon than him. Now that explains why Sun Tzu is in the title. My curiosity made me waste a few hours of my life reading into his semi-intellectual cynical rant. The provoking dark sense of humor in his nonesense is not worth your time, or your penny, for that matter."
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"Whiler certainly humerous at points, I was hoping for more creativity and readability. I became bored with it and didn't finish the whole thing."
1,I am dumber for having read this book,"Why can't I give this thing zero stars? Anyway, Stanley Bing needs to donate the proceeds of this book back to those of us who were dumb enough to purchase it. I picked it up as light reading for a cross country flight and it was just that: cotton candy light reading. The book meanders through Sun Tzu with little application of the original Art of War's paasages and waxes philosophic through various vignettes and asides in the ""warfare"" of the business world. Sun Tzu's brilliant work was written in the vein of self promotion through his deep beliefs on warfare. Bing's book is written with a self-promoting title and offers little in the way of a consistent philosphy other than being a rotten SOB. Call it what it is, business is business. If you want warfare, Stanley, put on a uniform and come join us on the front lines where we truly understand Sun Tzu."
2,Almost sub-par,"Sophomoric analysis without investigation or understanding to support position(s) as presented. Thinly veiled rant against conservative attitudes, wrapped in an ""Art of War"" review. The best parts of the book happen to be quotes by other people. Most of the authors attempts at humor fall short of the original statements made by people he quotes. I rate it two stars only because there is a good book to be written along these lines somewhere, if only a real author would do the work. Don't waste your money."
5,Corporate Politics is War!,This book is very enlightening and cool. Stanley Bing says it like it is. If you wait long enough your enemies will float down river!
4,Obsesion Grows on You,"Sanchez's Obsesion is a ""mistura fina"" of sonic colours. I was pleasantly surprised that even after this many years since its original release in 1998 the album still oozes a freshness one rarely comes across these days. This even more fascinating as almost all the composers are largely unheard of outside their native homelands. I particularly like how Sanchez handled composer Bobby Capo's ""Sonando con Puerto Rico""; a beautiful piece that will certainly linger just a little longer in your ear. Then there is the dreamy ""Essa Muhler"" penned by Brazilian composers Joyce and Anna Terra: ebullient, samba-isque, gentle, sweet as a lover's whisper - this is music that can romanticize the most unromantic of folk!It is evident Mr Sanchez really wanted to make a most personal musical statement and he succeeded. This recording would make a worthy addition to any serious music lover's collection.>>> Arthur A. Madonsela (Jazzanaire)."
1,This game is a technical disaster,"I've got a brand new Nvidia 5200 128 MB graphics card, and just got back into computer gaming, so I was eager to try this game because it's a genre I love. Plus, my PC played COD and Battlefield 1942 so there shouldn't have been technical problems to play it. Boy was I wrong to think that.This game is a technical disaster. I ran it on a P4 with 256 MB RAM and it still crashed on me three times, something that never happened even once with other games at all.After it crashed for the third time BEFORE I even got to start the first mission, I gave up.The developers really dropped the ball on this game. From its looks and screen shots I've seen, it looks like a great game. But if it's too unstable to play, nobody's going to notice it.This game is an absolute disaster from a technical standpoint and the developers should be ashamed of themselves."
2,Way too many commands,"Seriously, does there have to be a command for everything. I mean you have to have a list of comands sitting right beside your keyboard if you are to have any success, and to make things worse the default commands go against the standard configuration of every shooter that has ever existed. If you to have any success it is required that you map it out yourself. Something as simple as picking up a dropped gun requires the use of space bar, one, and then i for inventory, and while being shot at, you slowly steal the ammo from the dead guy. I'd hate to say it, but this game is shelved, and $30 is wasted."
2,"horrible control setup, struggling to even get started with this game","just like my title states i may never even get to play this one, way to many controls for this budget shooter horribly set up its quite boring so far and i may never go back to it dont pay more than 3-4 bucks and don't buy it unless you are extremly patient"
5,Greatness,"This is without doubt the best WWII game I have ever played on PC!! Far ahead of its time, the other WWII games of today, pale in comparison."
3,H&D 2,"Good graphics, good models, many weapons but buggy and laggy.I connected to a server. In the first map the game was a little buggy, in the next map the game was so buggy and laggy I couldnt even move!So heres a quick list of the game:PROS:-Good models and graphics-Many weapons-RealisticCONS:-Buggy and Laggy-Some glitches"
4,Entertaining Show,"I hope it comes back for another season. Some of the shows on tv are not entertaining but this show I can watch over and over,"
5,"""Perfect""","These sweats were the perfect shade of pink. Just right for my part as a ""little pig"" in ""Who's Afraid of the Big, Bad Wolf"" play our local theatre production group, The Backlot Players of Forsyth, GA, recently staged for area elementary schools."
1,Hanes Open Bottom Fleece Pant-Womens Size Med.,"Very disappointed in these sweat pants by Hanes. I had originally ordered a size Medium in Misses size since that is what the tag reads in my older pair I was needing to replace. Those were so small I couldn't even get them over my hips! So,I looked at Hane's size Chart and decided I needed a Medium size in Womens. So,I returned the Medium size pants and ordered the same in Med.W size. These pants are so large on me they come up a good seven inches above my waist, drag three inches on the floor and I could easily get both legs into one!! But I didn't want to return another pair so washed them in the hottest water I could and dried them on high thinking this would shrink them really good....NO!!! I hate these pants but they are mine now I'll have to live with them. Never again!"
3,Ok sweats,"These sweats are ok. They are comfortable and they didn't shrink too much, but I haven't had them 3 months yet and they are already starting to fade."
3,pants,"these pants are nice and comfy. The sizes run a little big but besides that they are very comfy. I throw them on to go to the corner store , walk around the house and even pajamas, great material. Only thing i will say is to order them maybe a size smaller."
4,YES!,Love the rich color and the fit is perfect.The thickness of the material is just right. The order arrived on time.
3,not what I thought,"I love these. However, I assumed by ""fleece"", they meant POLARfleece. Nope. These are really soft sweats. I love them, but they're not like I thought they'd be, so I was somewhat disappointed."
4,runs small,I'm giving this product 4 stars as they appear well made. The only thing wrong is that they run quite small. According to some of the other reviews Hanes has changed the style somewhat. I don't know about that but will say that if you are larger in the hips or thighs you will definitely want to go up at least one size.
3,It is ok,"It was so much more bigger than i tought, it's like for fat women. But instead of that, the product has a great quality and the shipment was very right, thanks"
3,They are what they are!,I wanted sweat pants and that's what I got. They shrunk about an inch after washing which was good since they were too long for me.
5,bobeche,"Bobeche were exactly as ordered, fit candles perfectly, and were so easy to find online. I spent months looking for them in stores locally."
4,simple,These may be a little thin on the glass.I am concerned I will break them as I am using them on a candlabra. Better suited to resting on a base.
4,Works Great! EZ Install....cold water now lukewarm,"I agree with most of the positive comments already provided but did want to provide on additional tidbit that we discoverd.As you can read the way this pump works is to move water from your hot water angle stop under your sink through their valve to the cold water supply (also under your sink). We noticed right away that our cold water is now warm to lukewarm because of the amount of hot water present in the cold water line. It takes a few minutes to get true cold water which sort-of defeats the purpose of installing this pump in the first place since you are trying to prevent the opposite issue on the hot water side.This actually bugs my wife more than me but If you enjoy cold water to brush your teeth, or drink tap water directly from that faucet this may be a concern as the water is not definately warmer."
3,"Ok product, don't overestimate ROI","I'll let others comment on the product's utility. One thing that I will add though, is that the assumptions miss out on one key factor: annual temperature variations. Almost all of the marketing that I read on these types of pumps assume that you will run your shower/faucet for the same amount of time year round. Not so at my house. We really only need the pump for about 3-4 of the coldest months of the year, so the water savings is about 3000 gallons for us (3.5 baths, 3 adults, 3 children). It's not nothing, but far less than the big numbers the sales guys would like you to believe. Your mileage might vary..."
3,Not quite what I expeced.......,"The product did not work exactly the way I expected. I was under the impression that the pump was activated by the sensor valve located under the sink, and operated only when needed. Instead, the pump works either continuously, or according to timer settings, depending upon your preference.I think I would prefer alternative pumps that are located under the sink and operate only when the temperature at the hot water faucet falls below a specified level. They may be initially a little more expensive, but are probably more efficient in the long run."
2,Hot water on cold side!,"We have had this product for a couple months and sensors are working fine, I turn off the cold water supply under the sink and turn on the cold water faucet, and no water. So the sensors are working. Unfortunately when I run the cold water taps we get hot/luke warm water all the time. We can't drink luke warm water in Phoenix when it's 115 degrees in the summer. I called Watts today and the representative told me to program the timer to run for an hour and then shut off for an hour during our peak hours, which is 6am - 10pm. I'll give it a shot, but I think this thing needs to be returned. Thoughts?"
1,May work for some but not for me,I found the pump was well made but the seperate valve assembly was of poor quality.I experienced warm water back-up one the cold water side. I hade to run the cold water for sometime before I got cold water. I found that I had to run hot water for quite a while before it was hot.I will have a true circulating system installed by a local contractor. I found amazon people were very helpful in my return of the product and a full refund.Great support from amazon. Thanks
3,"So, So product","Easy to install. Hard to set clock timer. Function is only so - so. Takes at least 15 to 20 minutes to warm up. Water delivered on startup only luke worm. Still takes quite a while get really hot. Obviously this depends on the route of the pipe ie. underground or insulated in an attic or indoor wall. Would save water, but if left on all the time to be really useful would certainly waste electricity! Only effective at tap where solenoid is placed, partially effective for tap beyond this, i.e in a shower beyond basin. I have added a radio remote controlled switch which I use instead of the buit in timer. Good luck!"
4,working well so far,my pump has been install about 3 weeks now and it's made a noticeable improvement. haven't got my gas bill yet. but i'm very please with it.
1,Question,I'm interested in this product. I've read many of the reviews. It appears that there is an exchange of hot water into the cold water pipes in every situation. I'm concerned because I've also read that the EPA recommends only using water from your cold water tap to prepare food and drinks to avoid unnecessary exposure to lead. Mixing your hot water source with your cold water source would seem to violate the EPA's recommendation. What am I missing?
1,"Think people, valve closes at 95 means OPENS at 94 alnight","Now I have a valve connecting my hot and cold pipes together. OH, that valve closes at 95 deg's, so it doesn't put hot water into cold pipe.And, what does the valve do when the hot water cools below 95F. Read the literature or you'll be paying the man big time.THE VALVE OPENS. AND STAY'S OPEN. All night long. Do you really want an open valve between your hot and cold pipes. Cold waters warm ALL THE TIME. Use cold water, drops pressure in cold line, hello hot water siphoning into cold line cause the hot line still has higher pressure. But, I only used cold water...but, the valve is open, sorry, pay the higher gas bill."
1,High Cost,"This is like dropping a $10 bill while trying to pick up a penny on the floor. Please consider the cost of constantly circulating warm water in your pipe system compared to the amount of water wasted while waiting for hot water. If you're concerned with being wasteful with water, save those water and use them for watering plant, etc."
1,DOES NOT WORK - BAD EXPERIENCE,"Bought this unit; Paid $300.00 for installation; Paid $200.00 for removal.System does not work. POOR INSTRUCTIONS. NO TROUBLE SHOOTING HELP.DO NOT BUY.To add to all this water Pressure in the FAUCETS dropped - need to get this repaired.My experiment may cost me well over $1,000 in drain."
1,does not work as advertised,does not work as advertised;Installed correctly but water is only lukewarm at best and takes same amount of time as before to get hot water;Tested valve as per instructions and seems to work but does not seeem to be able to operate as advertised;WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
5,Mostly pleased,"Everthing is good. My only compaint is that I wish the instructions were a little more helpful as to where to set the timer (time 0n, time off)."
4,Quick hot water,Pump works great. My house has pumbing lines for recirculation of hot water. Timer a little difficult to read and on/off switch on side of timer would have been a great addition.
5,Watts 5008000 Premier hot water recirculation pump,"Easy to install. Unit runs very quite, you can not even hear it run. The timer is great option and is very easy to set."
4,Easy hot Water,"Bought this item for a lady friend because I've got the same installed. Have not yet installed this one butwhen it is installed expect the same results I've gotten. No longer wait forever for hot water.WillWatts 500800 Hot Water Recirculating Pump, from Amazon"
5,Worked Great,These worked great. No problems. The labels are smaller then the Pitney Bowes lablels. I use to cut my Pitney Bowes labels so that I could get more use out of them and this is the same concept. A more cost effective option the the other lablels.
2,"Beautiful, but breakable.","My boyfriend bought me this seahorse necklace. It has a very cute, and tribal-like design. I wear it a lot. The BIG problem though is the string broke the first day I recived it, not only that. . . the metal thing that holds the string in broke as well. He had to buy a new string, a drill a new holder for the string to go into. Definently not worth $10 something plus shipping. It was a terrific gift, and I appreciate it. But i'm a bit dissapointed in the quality of this item, and so is my boyfriend."
3,"Finland beats China, price is right, but not ""100% xylitol""","The competitors use Chinese xylitol whereas these are Finnish, presumably from birch. At the very least, that provides more assurance of quality control. OTOH, the front of the box proclaims ""100% Xylitol"" when it actually contains more added ingredients than any other brand, listed in small print as ""Gum Arabic, Magnesium Stearate, Natural Flavor, Carnauba Wax, Beeswax"". The only distinction is that the other ingredients just add bulk without tooth decay. However, it IS 50% xylitol and the price per ounce of xylitol is slightly less than competitors with close to 100% (at least before shipping). Epic Dental makes nearly 100% (Chinese)zylitol mints."
4,Great Mints; Bad Box,"I love these mints. They have Xylitol, so they're good for teeth. The taste is not too intense. Perfect flavor.But the box, ugh., I use a tin instead, but it wouldn't take too much work to re-design the box to be functional. The tops are loose and the mints spill out. Every time. All over your purse, backpack, pocket."
3,These are .... ok.,"I was looking for a sugar free mint as the Smints that I used to be able to purchase are no longer around (sad state...).I tried these and they are ok. They are refreshing but just not very strong. They seem to dissolve very quicky and I'm left with wanting to grab another very soon after having one.Do they take care of any bad breath? I don't think they last long enough or are strong enough to do that. But, they are tasty.If you're looking for a tasty sugar free mint, these should work great for you.For myself, I don't think I'd get these again as I like the strong flavor and action of the sugar free Altoids better."
3,Not an introduction by any means,"There are probably several uses for this book, but learning topology from scratch is not one of them. In a couple of weeks I've made it through maybe the first five pages. I'm currently stuck, because as far as I can tell one of the early exercises wants you to form a quotient of a topology which hasn't been defined.Perhaps this book is useful to someone who's already taken a course in topology, perhaps not; I wouldn't know."
1,I hate this thing!,this thing is (poorly made)!first time I took it out of my playstation it broke!It wasn't worth the (money).It's another (poor) product from mad cats.It worked OK but not as well as it should of.If you ask me you'd be better off buying a RFU adapter straight from sony.
5,Game adapter review,"Worked instantly! Exactly what we needed, arrived on time. This was a replacement item for one that broke. It was purchased years ago and we weren't sure if we would find another one."
1,Major dissapointment for this automotive jouralism fan...,"I'm 39 years old, and have been an avid reader of all Car & Driver since I was 12 years old. I really looking forward to this book, and ended up being incredibly dissapointed. Instead of seeing a lot of reprints of interesting articles and road tests, the book is filled with editorial columns from the 'archives', and 'novelty' articles: How many times do readers have to see the old ""Baja Barnstorm Roadtrip""? I also didn't want to read (nor do I care) about who was executive editor from 196X-197X...I wanted to see old road tests, vehicle comparisons...and even more of the period (old) car advertisements."
1,The quality sucks!,"For the price they charged, it's a ripoff! My DVD is defective. The quality of the movie, in the beginning & at the end is poor. I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Monkey,This is really an origins story and does not include the companions Pigsy and Sandy. I'm looking forward to a possible release of the following chapters.
1,Ugh,"What a stupid main character. She's convinced she knows all while outwardly displaying really obnoxious low self-esteem. The story is standard and dull, the humor that I found in earlier Holden books is pretty much absent, and I eventually had to give up and stop reading. I don't know, perhaps the book redeems itself in the last third, but honestly, I stopped caring. The part that really disgusted me was when the main character completely disregards any idea that things are not always what she's sure they are, and ignores the likeliest of possible scenarios in favor of considering herself superior. I won't go into detail so as not to spoil anyone, but if you want to know what I mean, email me.But sheesh, what a dope."
2,Disappointing...,"I am a big Wendy Holden fan. All of her novels, especially Simply Divine and Gossip Hound, entertained me from beginning to end. However, Azur Like It, her new novel, is a big disappointment. This novel contains the same tale of a simple but ambitious young woman dreaming of having a glamorous job in which she mingles with the most fashionable socialites. It also contains satirical language with some fun puns. The main problem with Azur Like It is that it isn't quite as funny or as clever as her previous novels. This one bored me to tears and I couldn't wait to finish it! If Ms. Holden isn't able to bring something new to her formula, then her novels will continue to go downhill. I am still a big of this author -- I just hope that her next project is in the same vein as Gossip Hound."
4,a useful book on the topic of ethnographic research,"I happened upon this book by accident and am glad I did. There are some good chapters on different concerns in conducting ethnographic-type research in an Asian American community or organization as a co-ethnic. What kinds of things to beware of, what kinds of co-optation could possibly occur.Seems like some young, new researchers who are excited about the possibility of researching Asian Americans in real day-to-day situations. Some good insight into problems which could come up and the special advantages of ""researching your own.""Deals also with concerns of Asian Americans from one ethnic group conducting research with other ethnic Asian Americans."
1,Just a collection of forms,"Wow, I can't remember ever being so disappointed in a purchase. As a prospect research manager, I purchased this book to help in training a new research assistant. There is no information in this book on how to do prospect research; it is basically a collection of forms, plenty of which are included in Cynthia Hogan's superb book on the same subject. The above review was obviously written by the writer or publisher. Don't waste your money."
5,Superb!!!,"What's This Prospect Research Thing? is a ready-reference guide to implementing and establishing your prospect research department. Written by a prospect researcher, this unique book provides you with the tips you need to discover information, excavate wealth, and navigate the future of your major gift and planned giving departments. Novice researchers and fundraisers will appreciate the easy to use forms, tools to identifying wealth, record and time management templates, and the prospect researcher's library. Experienced researchers at established nonprofits will want to refresh their skills by reviewing the approach, the sample forms, analytical techniques, tracking procedures, and the witty prospect research nuggets covered in this guide."
5,the best of mawaca,This is the best CD Mawaca did since its beggining! They have lots of strong and vibrating Brazilian rhythms and the mixture they did with other tunes are fantastic!
5,"morals of a criminal, are words to live by...","this book is like the bible.it tells you how to live, and you wanna do it cuzits glamourous exciting and literary.william Burroughs turned me on to it, i wanna turn everyone on.................Some people are shits, darling.luv,BunBoy@cypro.net"
4,Great movie!,"This is the epitome of a ""B"" western movie, but it's hilarious! Andy Griffith, Tom Berrenger, Marilou Henner and Selma Ward--all of them did a great job on this!"
5,"Rustler's Rhapsody, an oldie but a goodie!!","My husband had me watch this movie with him years ago, and he, of course already had seen it and liked it, but I too really enjoyed it. I definitely wanted to add it to our DVD movie collection, and so searched for it on the internet, and of course found it where? Yes, through Amazon. Anyways, I purchsed this for my husband's birthday present, and he was very pleased I had even been able to find. I do a great deal of shopping with Amazon and surely am happy they are around to make life a little easier, even when you think you may not be able to find that certain item you are looking for. Give the movie a chance, I bet you like it. It is timeless. A perfect addition for anyone's movie collection."
2,Missing Scene,"The scene where Rex get's his 'confidence' back from the rancher's daughter and the Talketive bar girl is missing, I haven't seen the VHS to see if it is missing from that edition as well. I still love the movie, though."
5,family favorite,one of my families favorites..had it first on Beta...they were surprised when they opened it in Christmas morning onee of those love or don't movies
3,It's Not All the Others Crack It Up To Be,"I saw this ""thing"" when it first came out with about 20 other theater patrons awaiting some type of glorious spoof of the Old West, and, boy, what a disappointment. Forced would be about the word for it. Tom Berenger (absolutely terrific in ""Sniper"") leads a second rate cast in a third rate movie that has about as many laughs in it as a cancer clinic. Berenger does order a shot of whiskey with a ""hair in it"", but there's very little sustainable humor that preceeds or follows. Don't waste your money on this stinker, but spend it wisely on the Blu ray version of ""Blazing Saddles."""
5,Best Western Spoof!,"If you loved westerns as a kid, you'll love the satire and spoof Rustler's Rhapsody. Every thing that you were amazed at is now open for discussion. Tom Berenger is excellent, as are the rest of the familiar cast. Be prepared to laugh until you cry. It's one you will watch over and over as I have."
2,DVD version is incomplete,"I am so annoyed that the movie I purchased has been edited and I was not warned on the package. I wish I had seen the June 1, 2004 comments which indicated that this movie is missing a crucial scene. I cannot recommend that you buy this DVD since Paramount has released an incomplete version of the movie.Why did they alter the movie by deleting the scene where Rex becomes a 'confident heterosexual' ? The punch line to the major joke/tension of the movie is missing in this DVD version.I cannot recommend that you buy this DVD if you are a fan of the movie. Also, the DVD has no extras or commentary it really is a rush job on their part.It is a terrible release of a great unknown movie. It still is funny, but not as funny as the original. Contrary to what Amazon says, I am referring to the DVD version of this movie."
1,"Travesty... not movie, but disk","Incredibly fond of this film... I bought it and discovered that it was missing some scenes... including one that helped wrap up the plot... followed by one with the two women communicating about the missing scene...It was as if somebody wanted a G-Rating on this and kicked it out fast. I can live without the special features and trailers... but when I pay for a film, I expect the whole film...The supplier and Amazon are not to blame... but I am angry and disgusted. A butchered film will never get more than one * from me.YP"
4,Very Amusing,"A western comedy? Not too many of those out there. Maybe that's why Rustler's Rhapsody isn't as well-known as it deserves to be.I had a great time watching this. The humor level is above-average in terms of sophistication. It doesn't take itself too seriously but never degenerates to the point of absurdity. A good cast helps round out the film's enjoyment.It's too bad there aren't any special features found on this disk. However, the low price makes up for it. Add the fact that this DVD is in anamorphic widescreen (the quality all widescreen movies should be in but aren't) and you have a terrific value. Highly recommended."
5,Pssssttt wanna good laugh????,"Rustlers' RhapsodyWhat can I say...simply a great escapist movie..I first saw this movies many years ago, whilst serving in the Australian Army, and my offsider and I wereon detachment to our nations capital - Canberra ACT. We were being housed by civilian contractors, and they had inhouse video, and you guessed it. This was the movie, we actually laughed ourselves horse watching it 3/4 times, Ido not really remember, but I did promise myself one day I would get my own copy, and I did. It is slapstickcomedy to me, with all actors being party to some very funny scenes. Andy griffith, Tom Beringer, GW Bailey andso on, There is clever use of what ""you can only hear , e.g. the cattlman's herd of cattle"" There is alwayssomething going on in the background, so you need to keep watching or as we do, rerun themovie. Want a good laugh, watch Rustlers Rhapsody, you could die laughing"
5,More Exposure,"I used to watch this movie all the time when I was little. I had memorized all the lines and the songs. It is one of my family's favorite movies to quote. I wish more people would see this movie. It is very much more subtly done than any spoof I've seen. It is so well done, that if someone were to walk in on it, not knowing it was a comedy they'd think it was a true western, not a satire. I'm praying it gets more exposure so that it might someday come out on dvd...(hopefully with extras)."
2,Can't Say I Wasn't Warned,"I gave it 2 stars because I love the (original) movie and anyone who hasn't seen the original cut may enjoy this. BUT, although I knew some of it had been removed I didn't understand just how much. Patrick Wayne and Marilou Henner originally had significant and hilarious roles that have been reduced to short, almost-less-than-cameo appearances, leaving the storyline with a chopped-up feel. Whole segments of the movie have just disappeared. This is a horrible disappointment to me and if I can ever find the original version I'll give or throw this one away. It's that bad.This should never have been released without a large warning label."
3,western comedy movie,I enjoyed this movie (again) it is a silly funny cowboy western that almost could have been greata fun watch
3,Oldie but goodie,"Havent seen this for a number of years but it stuck with me that I wanted to see it again. It's just a little more crude than I remember, a little Andy Griffith innuendo, but still nothing compared to todays movies. This movie is a little slow but has it's moments. For the price and love of old westerns it's worth a watch."
5,escuche el disco es buenisimo,"El disco es producido por myriam hernandez y humberto gatica.Tiene ya dos grandes exitos, el primero de Armando manzanero HUELE A PELIGRO y el segundo de ESTEFANO se llama La fuerza del amor. El tercer tema a promocuion sera DESEO de monica naranjo. Tiene un nuevo clip."
3,"Victim of the ""loudness War""","Myriam hernandez with her angelic crystal clear voice is an example of what kind of music comes out of Latin America which is hardly known here in the U.S. Unfourtunately, this recording suffers greatly due to the highly distorted non-dynamic sound from the levels being pushed way too high which is common in today's mp3 world known as ""the loudness war"". There are a few great songs here but if you want to find what Myriam really sounds like, look for the earlier albums as the latter releases no longer follow her musical style as she is now trying to sound like Shakira and the rest. Maybee it's time to retire before she taints her image in order to conform to today's interpretation of what music is. Check out these CD's for her earlier defining work.Todo Lo Mio,Myriam Hernandez,Myriam Hernandez"
3,worked great until it failed :-(,Speed for photos & video was slightly faster than a standard Pro Duo in mySony Cybershot DSCW80 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot (Black). Not much else to say except it did what is is was supposed to do until it failed. When it failed it could not write or read data. All data on the card was lost including pictures taken at the air & water show.
5,"Fast memory card, works fine","Amazon had a great price, so decided to go with it for another $10 over the regular card. Installed this on my Sony CyberShot DSCW55 Digital Camera. Not sure if I benefit from the extra performance of the card, but I got it anyway. Cards works great, no problems."
1,The memory stick adapter is not working!,"The memory stick PRO works good, but the adapter does not, some kind of weak contact I guess. This is not a problem of my memory reader (it works fine with other memory stick cards)."
5,Product and service review,The item arrived in excellent condition. It was worth my money. It is basically a very good product. The memory is quite good.
5,This is excellent,SanDisk 2 GB Ultra II Memory Stick Pro Duo Mobile SDMSPDU-2048-A10M (Retail Package)This product is excellent
1,SD or sd ??,"My mistake. I bought a San Disk card but it was the wrong sd. It was a SD memory stick that did not fit my camera which uses a SD (secure digital)card I was able to return it for a small fee,it was my fault after all, so it was a learning experience."
4,Memory Stick,It works really well. My wife was used to a 1 GB stick in her 5.1 MP camera but this one really helps out since she moved up to 8.1 MP.
4,Fast,I have experience with many memory stick pro duos from both Sandisk and Sony. This Ultra II is the fastest one I've used and really makes a difference when transferring big files for my Laptop.This memory card is pretty much problem free.
5,Memory Stick substitute,"This memory stick (2GB Ultra) works very well in my new Sony DSC-H9 camera. There is no need to spend the extra money for the Sony product, in my opinion."
1,'We Are Not Devo' - A Devo Tribute (Revelation),"Pretty much for die-hards only.Even THEN,you'll most likely be let down.Believe this CD is my first one-star rating,out of all my reviews I've done upon this site.Main problem here is that I seriously doubt any of the thirteen bands that appeared on this disc were all that familiar with Devo.UNLESS you spot this title for like $1.00,you might want to avoid it.Might get better use out of it as a drink coaster."
2,Incomplete & Nonessential,"Want Devo songs to be more rock and less punk? That is perhaps the only angle that works on this album. One must question the logic of a tribute album: what are any of these bands adding to these songs?...and...what CAN be added to a Devo song? Nothing of particular merit here, and it's almost sad for a band to use a Devo tribute as a leg-up into the industry."
4,New twist on New Wave classics,"Although you can't really improve on the originals, this album gave us a new look at these great songs. ""Blockhead"" is powerful stuff. This album helped me expose a new generation to all of our Spudly favorites"
5,Delightful!,This is a delightful little book filled with recipes and family stories the authors grew up with. Records a way of life and a way of cooking that can raise the cultural awareness of all Americans! Great book!
4,AT&T Moto Q9H Phone Offer By Amazon,"Phone is great. Price from Amazon is unbeatable. However for AT&T customers that have existing rollover minutes & are upgrading plan minutes, read the contract well. In most cases you will lose your old existing minutes. You'll be starting out with only the new plan minutes. Beware!"
4,Good Stand,"This is a nice, affordable stand to take with you to lessons, events, what ever. The only thing is the case it comes with is a bit flimsy, and it tore along the seem."
2,You get what you paid for.,"I got this in 2008 for my son.It worked for short time and then started to be very hard to open and close.Everytime he practiced, he had to ask me to open and close.Then it broke before even 6 months of use."
4,Works well,"Sometime it sticks and pinches the kid, but for the price it does what it's supposed to.... Hold up music sheets : )"
4,Great For The Beginner,I've only been playing guitar for about 2 months.I needed a music stand and this one is just fine. The price is right.I'm 6' tall and I could read music fine off of it.The only negative is the top does not lock in. If you move it around a lotthe head will slide off. No biggie. Slide it back on and your good to go.
5,great idea,This was the best thing I bought for my son. He takes it every day to school for pratice. It is so easy to fold down into the bag. Its not heavy so he can carry it and his drum.
3,Simple stand gets the job done,The stand is simple and effective. Bag is included. Arrived on time as promised. Good deal for the price.
5,Quality Product and Great Price,"Delivery was quick!! For the price that I paid for this purchase I expected to receive a low quality product. However, the music stand is of good quality and the bag is sturdy."
4,Value,"When I first received it I was disappointed. It was flimsier than I had imagined, but once I got it put together and checked it out, I realized it was pretty sturdy regardless of what it looked like.For the price, it's a pretty good value in my opinion."
1,a DISASTER that happens every time its used,"This stand is a DISASTER every time we use it. Not only does the stand not allow any adjustment of its music support in any direction--neither tilting back or forward or turning left or right, the top is not attached to the bottom with any kind of fastener. It just slips on the post at only one angle and one direction, the direction of the base. So to adjust the stand even the least bit, you're going to need to pick the whole thing up. And every other time you try to move the stand a little to get it sitting right, you invariably forget and lift it by the top, which slips off the post, with all the music on it which of course falls to the ground, hopefully not during a gig. I HATE THIS STAND.There are far better stands for the same price, like the SLM stand I use all the time, adjusts in every direction, and has fasteners for everything that moves or comes apart."
2,poor quality,"This stand is too weak, it is break apart easily. The carry bag is also really poor quality. The valco on it doesn't work. The stand fall out all the time."
4,Good basic stand,"Good basic stand. Nothing great. It works great for me to travel with since it breaks down so small and light. Only four stars because it is easy to tip over with the heavier music books. Otherwise, it does the job at a great price, and is suprisingly tough. I've dropped it a few times with no damage."
5,flexibility on a music stand,"this folding music stand has a sharp look to it in the black style, is very portable and easy to assemble. It has made it easier for us to set up and get ready to perfform in all settings and oon all kinds of stages. Love this product."
3,great buy for price,i have been using this stand for gigs and it works well. i love that it comes with a carry case to keep all the pieces together. no complaints...works well
3,Not too impressed.,Purchased stand for my 10 year old son. He has difficulty setting it up. I have to do it for him and it takes me a few attempts. Cant complain for the price but it is not something I would recommend.
3,West Music Wire Music Stand with Bag (black),This product was an okay product For the price. It does the job and is quite portable. It is easy to put up and take down and put away. The shipping was reasonable and came quickly without delays. I would recommend it to others.
5,Does What You Expect of It,"The Coolpix 990 AC Adapter does just what it is supposed to do, which is to allow you to use your camera for as long as you wish without having to worry about batteries running down. This is especially important when downloading files to your computer. You can travel abroad with it as it works on 100-240 volts, 50 or 60 cycle AC. My only quibble is not with the adapter, but the camera circuitry, which requires that you remove the batteries when using any AC adapter. It will not recharge them, but might cause the batteries to overheat (according to Nikon)."
2,some things to consider first,"I didn't read anything about the need to remove the batteries while using the adapter with the instruction that came with the adapter. There was a warning about not using the adapter too long or else it might over heat the camera, but it didn't specify what ""too long"" is. The AC cable that came with the camera is only good for either 120 or 240 volts. You MUST use different cables for different voltages. My recommendation is to spend your money on getting more rechargeable batteries intead of buying this adapter. Make sure you get batteries with 1600mha ratings."
1,Incompatible Adapter/Battery Charger EH-31,"Page 163 of the Nikon CoolPix995 camera guide states that ""The AC Adapter EH-31/30 cannot be used with the CoolPix995."" The foregoing statement appears under the paragraph explaining the use of Nikon AC Adapter/Battery Charger EH-21."
3,"Some gems, some sacrilege","It's one thing for a band to cover a lesser known song of one of their influences, or to reinvent a famous song for their generation, whatever. Its another thing entirely for some no-talent hack like Sean Combs to lay some ""Oooh-yeah""s over a tune as immortal as Kashmir (twisted into ""Come With Me"") and call it a song. Combs wouldn't know a good song if it hit him in the face, or, more accurately, if someone else wrote it. Puffy's cover is nothing more than a limp-wristed marketing grab. Musically, it is a complete waste.The same goes somewhat for the Wallflowers shoddy attempt at Bowie's ""Heroes."" Bowie is a god, and as good as Jakob may one day be, the younger Dylan is simply not yet worthy of touching this brilliant piece of Bowie/Eno work.The rest of the album is typical soundtrack fodder, with the notable exception being Rage Against the Machine's invigorating ""No Shelter,"" almost strong enough on its own to justify buy! ! ing this album."
1,WE WANT IFUKUBE!,"A real Godzilla soundtrack would contain the work of Akira Ifukube, the creator of the tremendous original Godzilla music. This is a bunch of pop crap nonsense, none of which have anything to do with the film just as the film has nothing to do with Godzilla. Only Arnold's tracks have any merit, and if you buy this album, you are sending the unfortunate message that original orchestral soundtracks should be downplayed in favor of marketing gimmicks of pop-schlock in no way related to the film. WAIT FOR THE REAL SOUNDTRACK RELEASED LATER THIS SUMMER!"
2,"A disappointment, and here's why:","Let's face facts. Lots of well-known bands/singers on the Godzilla Album, but many of them were horribly mainstream, which explains the pitiful quality of many of the songs. The only actually decent songs on that entire CD are RATM's No Shelter and Silverchair's Untitled. O yeah, and DOTN's Running Knees is alright. Otherwise, though, the songs just weren't what they should've been. Many artists on that CD have gone so mainstream, their song quality has really diminished...although most performers on that CD are just plain bad. All in all, a major letdown. Is it worth the 3 good songs? With the lack of singles...still debatable."
1,What? This cd is good? NOT!!,I absolutely was disappointed in this CD. The movie was OK but the CD stunk. The only song I could really listen to again with any hope of enjoying was the cover by the Wallflowers.
1,Not worth it.,"I was very disappointed with this CD (Thats putting it mildly).All it is a collection of dumb songs(like ""Undercover"")that only come up in the backround of the movie when you can't even hear them.The only good thing about this CD is the two tracks of David Arnold's perfect score.I hope they release the actual score at some point."
2,Soundtrack closely resembles the quality of the movie.,"There are about 4 songs that I enjoyed off of this soundtrack. Puff Daddy's ""Come With Me"" produces a burst of excitement for the first couple of times you hear it. Then you want to think ""When is it going to be over?"". Really, the song is about 6 minutes long. A favorite that I still listen to is the song by GreenDay. Another hit includes the song by SilverChair. Other than these groups, most of the songs seem weak and repetitive. If you're thinking of buying this CD, take my advice and listen through the tracks first."
2,This was a horrid waste of a CD,"Godzilla was by far one of the worst soundtracks that I have ever heard. I was highly disappointed with the product(as was the case with the movie). This soundtrack has a large variety of music types, but is lacking the type that it needs the most... David Arnold's! The soundtrack would have been far more enjoyable if it was solely David Arnold's original score for the film."
2,Hokey at Best,"It's not enough that the film was an insult to the 1954 original. They had to make it worse by attaching this pathetic soundtrack filled with 3rd rate groups bleeting their mediocre efforts. Save your money and obtain the score to the original Godzilla film, or seek out the hard to find SCORE ONLY from the newer 1998 film. I'm surprised that David Arnold would have allowed himself to be associated with this tripe."
1,This CD needs a parental warning!,"We took the kids to the movie, and it seemed to drag on and on. Didn't notice anything objectionable about it tho. When my son wanted the soundtrack, I thought ""ok, I like the Wallflowers' song, why not?"" Immagine my surprise when a couple of weeks later we had a house full of company, and my son put this CD on......Oh My God! There are more foul words on this CD than there are in an R rated movie! I dont recommend this soundtrack to anyone. Save yourself the embarassment of owning something like this, and purchase something that won't make your mother-in-law's chin hit the floor."
3,Tis pretty cool!,"I admit that some of these songs are lacking on talent, but most are pretty cool! Theres the cover on Bowies ""Heros"" by the Wallflowers. And of course you can't forget ""Come with me"" by Puffy feat. Jimmy Page. I say give this album a try!"
5,One of the best soundtracks ever,No other soundtrack compares with this one. Top name bands and artists with great work. Not some junk thrown together. Puff daddy's song is one of his best. The wallflowers song is very good.
2,The only good songs are by Puffdaddy and Greenday,"I like the cover and the CD design. I don't have the CD but I'm borrowing it from a friend. I'm not impressed with any of the songs except for the Greenday song and the Puffdaddy song. I was going to buy the CD, but not now, only for two songs."
1,Music is energetic but lyrics are revolting.,"Music is energetic but lyrics are revolting to me i.e.: Come With Me - ""I'm destructive, Some women find that seductive."" Wallflowers - ""And you-you can be mean and I-I'll drink all the time cause we're lovers-and that's a fact."" Out There - ""I was sent here... on some devil ship... breaking someones spirits and when you're done there I'll be here... I'll be your experiment."" This one is not for my household."
2,Very Commercial. Cotton Candy Music.,"I bought this CD because of the Jimmy Page/Puff Daddy colaboration. Very disappointing. Puff Daddy takes away the power of the original Zep beat by adding a busy high hat and the bass drum sounds like a Phil Collins record. Over compressed. Also, on all the commercials hyping this movie I kept hearing Blue Oyster Cults song ""Godzilla"". This song isn't on the CD. What's Up? I would have loved to hear Nine Inch Nails redo that classic. The David Bowie song ""Heroes"" redone by the Wallflowers is the only number worth listening too and, being a cover song, you can only listen to it for a short time before you want to hear the original."
2,"Ummmmmmmmm, no","Well, if the Foo Fighters, Green Day, Ben Folds Five, and Days of the New weren't on it, i would never have bought it. The Puff Daddy is bad enough, but add in Jamiriquoi, Rage Against the Machine, and the almost country song ""Macy Day Parade"" and its pretty much a bad CD. The only really good song is ""A320"" from the Foo Fighters, and to tell you the truth, i only got the sond track for that one song."
4,* G-OO-D*,"Good soundtrack. The cd rocks with ""Come with me"" by Puff Daddy and Jimmy Page, "" Heroes"" by the Wallflowers, and ""Untitled"" by Silverchair. the other songs are good too. The movie on the other hand is another story."
2,Don't buy this CD,"not suprisingly, this cd was about as good as the movie. IT SUCKED! There are very few good songs on this album. Come with me(kinda makes you wonder about those lyrics, huh?;-)), No Shelter, Brain Stew, Untitled, Opening Credits, and Looking For Clues. Everything else sucks. IT may be a lot of music by talented groups, but these tracks sucked. Heroes sucked, Deeper Underground was okay, Running Knees sucked, Macy Day Parade sucked, Air sucked, A320 sucked, Walk the Sky sucked, OUt there sucked, and the worst song on the album was Undercover. Listen to that track at your own risk! Or better yet, don't listen to it at all. iF you're a green day fan, just buy insomniac, the G-remix isn't that much better than the original, anyway."
4,It was pretty damn good,"The album provides various sorts of highly entertaining music. The foo fighters, Walflowers and puff Daddy leading the charge."
4,Good sndtrk any hardrock fan should get this one.,This is a definate winner with Rage Against the Machine and Green Day. A good album to crank on the stereo.
2,One Song,Purchased for litereally ONE song that I can't find elsewhere...the rest of the CD isn't that good.
3,Godzilla pure mother****ing filler,"Does anyone see the irony of the song 'No shelter - Rage Against The Machine' being included on this compilation. I suggest you listen to the lyrics, in my opinion the most powerful of any Rage song. On such an over-produced money generating machine of a movie that Godzilla is, you'd expect a song about the evils of corporate America to not be included ""View the world from American eyes/ bury the past/ rob us blind/ and leave nothing behind"".The rest of the compilation is mediocre, with some standouts such as 'Brain Stew', 'Air', 'Deeper Underground' and the score/instumentals at the end. The only thing that makes 'Come With Me' sound half decent is the use of the guitar riff from 'Kashmir - Led Zeppelin', a classic. However, in all other respects it is garbage.It's a fair compilation for a god-awful movie, but nothing special."
4,"Horrible Movie, Excellant CD","When I heard that there was a soundtrack for Godzilla (1998), which wasn't actually about Godzilla, I didn't want to get it. But, when I went into a music store and listened to some music samples, I got it. There are four songs on it I like: 2. ""Come With Me"" by Puff Daddy (Now known as P. Diddy)- Great orchestra playing in background, a little too long, though. 3. ""Deeper Underground"" by Jamiroqui- A cool rap song. 4. ""No Shelter"" by Rage Against The Machine- Amazingly cool guitar songs and lyrics. 10. ""Brain Stew"" by Green Day- I can't explain how cool it is."
3,A few good songs for a REALLY BAD movie...,"I'll admit that GODZILLA is not the best film in the world. It's no TITANIC or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN either. Since I'm 15, it was supposed to appeal to my audience. But make the movie have a plot. The soundtrack isn't too bad though. A few good tracks, and some empty ones. That only tracks I really listen to are 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 14, 15. Wallflowers to composer David Arnold. Not a bad soundtrack. As for the movie... PLOT DOES MATTER. - SK"
5,Godzila-the album,I personally think this and the City of Angels soundtrack are the best cds out for movies.Godzilla the album features songs by the Wallflowers Rage Against the Machine and Puff Daddy.If you like alternative music and you like the movie then you will definatly like or enjoy this cd. Thanks for reading my review...
3,Covering Bowie,"I didn't like the Heroes cover too much at first, but now I think it's an ok alternative (now that Microsoft killed the original). It's definitely cheesier now, and I miss some of those Eno keyboard lines."
5,The best soundtrack of the year!,"If you haven't already heard or bought this album yet, you're making a big mistake. They have Puff Daddy, Jamiroquai, Rage Against the Machine, Green Day, and The Wallflowers, a show stopping mix. My 3 favoprite songs of the album are:1)Come With Me...........Puff Daddy2)Deeper Underground.....Jamiroquai3)No Shelter.............Rage Against the Machinethis album's a definate buy"
4,"""Undercover"" by Joey Deluxe","I havent seen the movie,and had not intended to, except perhaps when it comes out on video. I have heard the cd and there is only one song that grabbed me and it was ""Undercover"" by Joey Deluxe. I tried more then once to listen to each cut from the soundtrack, but 10 to 30 seconds into them proved to be a waste of my time and an insult to my taste in music.I did find ""Undercover"" to be a refreshing change, easy to listen to and also good for dancing... It was a tad remanissant of the ""sultans of swing"" from the late 70's by Dire Straits...if this had been a single I would have bought it, I look forward to hearing more from Joey Deluxe"
2,Almost but not quite worth it,"I got this CD for two reasons and two reasons only - ""Heroes"" and ""Come With Me"" (and the latter only because I couldn't remember the name of the original song). For the most part, that was all I kept it for. (Ben Folds Five has a decent offering, but this was offset when I nearly choked upon hearing Jamiroquai's tone-deaf ""Deeper Underground."")"
4,Review for the SOUNDTRACK...,"...Because so many of the reviewers rated the *movie* and not the blasted *soundtrack* here! I guess taking the time to look for the movie page would be too much effort.Anyway, the CD's a decent mix of songs. Though I despise most of his music, Puffy's ""Come with Me"" is oh so catchy. The other performers give decent poppy rock performances. If you like their standard fare, you'll more than likely enjoy their tracks here. Worth a buy."
3,One big green mess of genres,"GODZILLA was the biggest disappointment of 1998. THE ALBUM isn't much better, sporting a variety of genres - most of which are tracks that have nothing to do with the film.The album opens with The Wallflowers' ""Heroes"", which has nothing to do with the film (see?!) and isn't that great. Then we have beat-stealer Puff Daddy's ""Come With Me"", a very good song with a heavy beat stolen from Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"". One of, if not the, greatest song on the album is Green Day's remix of ""Brain Stew"", a terrific song with a cool sound that sounds like the story of some stoned teen waking up for school. My favorite song of the CD, however, is Ben Folds Five's awesome ""Air"", a great song that starts off calmly, then goes to a cool, casual beat, and finally to a pumped-up rock beat.Overall, if you like those songs or are a fan of the artists on the CD, pick it up. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,"Bar four songs, this album is utter trash","I bought this the day it was released (on cassette), and before getting to the ""Deeper Underground"" track, I felt gypped. Needless to say, besides the aforementioned song, there's nothing else on side 1 that's even worth listening to. OK, on to side 2... I hated the Foo Fighters' song, and I absolutely wholeheartedly DESPISE anything by Green Day, so my loathing of ""Brain Stew"" was a given. However, I immediately fell in love with Silverchair's ""Untitled"" (a beautiful, sombre song), and Fuzzbubble's ""Out There"" was great(the sci-fi theme was very cool). Another song I really liked was Joey Deluxe's ""Undercover"" (too bad he doesn't have any albums of his own out; I'd buy some more of his music anytime). Bar those four songs, this album is trash."
2,"Plain and simple, not every song is worth listening to","This album was made to appeal to a broad range of music fans, mostly rock, and a little bit of pop and rap. I'd say that no more than 40 % of these songs are worth listening to, which comes out to a 2 star rating. Notables: Rage's great hard rock song ""No Shelter"", the funky dance song ""Deeper Underground"" by Jamiroqui, the ballad ""Air"", and lastly, the Green Day ""Brain Stew"" remix. The Puff Daddy-Jimmy Page collaboration was one of the worst rock-meets-rap songs I've ever heard. Noone has been able to make a good rap-rock song since Aerosmith and Run-DMC. The opening ""Heroes"" is very weak, and much of the album is just to take up time on the cd. Do not buy this CD! At best, just copy the aformentioned good songs from Napster. I'm out."
2,Rage Against The Machine is the best band on this cd.,"It's an ok cd. Rage is the best on it, and Green Day is good too.(I just dont like how they remixed this song)."
3,What about David Arnold...,"Who's music dominated this film anyway, all of the altenative music on this soundtrack, or David Arnold's score. I was extremely mad when I found out that David Arnold only had 2 tracks on this CD. I think his score was one of the few highlights of this movie. I enjoyed the contempory music on this soundtrack but wished that the score dominated it. Hopefully a score album wil be released soon..."
5,"WOW,,, just imagine.","Imagine Worship music in the style of all your favourite Christian groups!! well thats basicaly it... its great Jarsofclay, Dctalk and loads more for you to enjoy... I love the song mywill by dc talk!"
5,CD FROM ROCKETOWN WORTH EVERY PENNY,"I was given this advanced release by my sister-in-law who picked it up during GMA week in Nashville. It's never left my changer since! Billed by producer Michael W. Smith as ""... a new vision of Worship"" this CD is has a more mainstream sound than the usual fare of CCM productions. 10 tracks including songs by dc Talk, Jars of Clay, Crystal Lewis and (old) newcomer Chris Rice. The strongest offerings include ""Brighten My Heart"" by Sixpence None the Richer, ""Draw Me Close"" by the Katinas and ""I See You"" by Michael W. Smith. (Although, MWS has always been a better songwriter and keyboardist than singer)."
5,Worship music at its BEST,"Michael W. Smith organized one of the best, if not THE BEST compilation of Christian music I have ever heard. This album has NOTHING BUT CLASSICS and I would be lying if I said I haven't listened to it 50-60 times in the last couple years. The indirect tribute to Rich Mullins at the end just clinches the heart and creativity of the CD. (I would give this CD 6 stars if I could!)Great upbeat songs: MY WILL (DC Talk), AGNUS DEI (Third Day), I SEE YOU (Michael W. Smith)Great mellow songs: MAKE US ONE (Cindy Morgan), DRAW ME CLOSE (The Katinas), SALVATION BELONGS TO OUR GOD (Crystal Lewis)I have actually bought this one for others and had never-ending thanks. :) This music will lift your mind and your spirit straight to heaven. 5 STARS PLUS!"
1,Cheap. You get what you pay for.,"This lighter is very cheap in quality and needs to be filled after 3 ""successful"" lights. The Dead Head logo was fantastic, until that is, it chipped and flaked away after the first day. It even came with scratches already on it. Hooray."
1,*,I wish i would have seen the above comment before I ordered. This lighter IS NOT silver. The picture was chipped when i recieved my product. All around cheaply made.
1,cheap!,my daughter got this for her 1st birthday after seriously thinking of returning this item I ended up putting it together. Nightmare! Just a pain to get together. Too many pieces..directions not exactly clear..there is barely a bounce...and doesn't even ride good...I knew I should have just returned it and got something else because after 1 week I put it out in the trash..Im just glad it wasn't my money that I spend.
1,Dangerous,"The first time I tried these, the brush fell right off the glove. My dog could have swallowed it or choked on it. I sent them back and would never buy them again. I had to give it one star or I couldn't send in this review, but it doesn't deserve any stars. This product should be banned."
5,Wonderful book!,I found some real wooden shoes that would actually fit my granddaughter and I wanted her to see where children wore them in Holland. This book gave her a great example with an enjoyable story as well! My order arrived quickly and I am a happy customer.
2,The last one???,"One of the stools received was broken. The swivel top was broken off and one of the legs was split. I returned the item to Amazon using the damaged goods procedure. Amazon emailed me that it was the last one in stock and that they could only issue a partial refund (they charged me for shipping also) instead of an exchange...Hmmm, why are they still for sale here then?If you order, hope you don't get the broken stool that's supposedly ""the last one""."
4,Very Good Sophomore Effort,"If you grew up listening to fast punk music, you will like this album. Page Avenue was a good album, but a little on the pop side like many other bands do to get noticed. However, the boys from Story Of The Year prove on this album that they are musically inclined and want to let it all out. Don't listen to the negative critics on this page because I don't think they know what heavy music is all about. Its about personal conflict not blood and bitting things that you would not normally want to put in your mouth. Keep getting tattoos and piercings you angry little boys."
3,"In The Wake Of Determination, i determine this album is alright","Story of the Year's new album In The Wake Of Determination is much heavier in sound that Page Avenue. Even though I have listened to this album at least 3 times, I havent picked out any songs that I want to listen to over and over again. It seems as if every song is the same. Instead of purchasing In The Wake Of Determination, I'd suggest buying Page Avenue which is a much better album."
5,4 1/2 stars if possible.,This story of the year album is not that bad. If you listen it is actually not a bad CD concerning story of the year has changed a bit but come on. Page Avenue is still better. If story of the year still kept their punkish screamo mood the same then this CD could have been better. This CD is in the style of alternative metal. This band is still good but this CD doesnt match up to their strong and powerful debut album Page Avenue.
4,Let it sink in...i mean really sink in... for awhile..,"Ok so yeah.. its a good thing i didnt write my review after the first few times i listened to this cd... because after the first few listenings i was like oh my what happened, and was slightly dissapointed in the change... but something clicked... and now i cant seem to take this cd out of my player... But trust me, u have to give it a chance or shall i say a few chances... but now honestly it might be one of the better cds ive heard so far this year... but there is a lot of good stuff coming out later on... so.. but anyways, trust me ""im bad to pass judgement on cds too quickly!"" but on this one if you take the time, the cd will prove to be worth it."
5,Just a good as Page Avenue,"So, I admit, I actually burned ""in the wake of determination"" from a friend, mainly because it had been getting such poor reviews. But now, I wish I'd just bought it. It's actually a really good cd. It's a bit heavier than page avenue, and there's more screaming, but at it's heart, it's the same music you love SOTY for. So don't listen to all these negative reviews, ITWOD is just as good as Page Avenue.Oh yeah, and if you get the chance, check out the video for ""take me back"". It's awesome!"
3,this is more SOTY than page avenue was...,"i'm not gonna lie the first few times i listened to this cd i thought it was very very good. but being somewhat of a musician you start to pick out things like stale lyrics, predictable chord progressions, and a relative lack of creativity. unfortunately i found all of those things after listening to this for the 5th or 6th time. to soty's credit they put out a record that is more THEIR style and less maverick's style. the reason page avenue sounded the way it did was because of john feldman (goldfinger frontman) and not because thats the way soty wanted to sound. all that aside, im glad they made a record that was a little more their style, albeit something that i probably wont be listening to in a few weeks."
2,From a huge fan... very dissapointed,"Whatever heart these guys put into Page Avenue apparently stayed with that album. Usually bands mature, or at least evolve, in their sophomore effort. Wake of Determination only proves that SOTY is quickly losing their real punk (not pseudo-hardrock) sound, catchy choruses, and sadly: talent. Whoever said this album was ""hard"" probably moshes to the new Papa Roach cd. It's not hard at all... Page Avenue had its variety of hard riffs, harder screams, and more importantly, passion. Marsala's singing aside, ""Is This My Fate?"" is probably the best song on the cd, but being the last song on a list of real winners like 'Meathead' its just too little too late."
5,Getting Worse?!?!? HOW ABOUT NO!!!!!!!!!,"In the Wake of Determination, is the best freakign CD out. It beats Page Avenue in every way possible, the guitar riffs are awsome, alot of artificial harmonics to boot. The lyrics are crap in some parts, as I dont like the swearing, but the rest of it is awsome. Sleep has the best sounding bridge ever. If you dont like this album, quite seriuosly, go jump off a cliff."
5,Story Of The Year In The Wake Of Determination,"I just got this CD yesterday and I listened to the whole thing. Every song on the CD is good. I like the whole CD. I recommend this and I also think you should get there first CD Page Avenue as well.Favorite Songs:We Don't Care AnymoreTake Me BackOur Time Is NowTaste The Poisen""Is This My Fate?"" He Asked Them(but every song is good)"
2,Not as good as it should be,I liked pretty much every song on Page Avenue but this CD is just gets anoying after a few listens. What happened to the aggresiveness they used to have. This new stuff is just not as good as it should be. Its almost like they decided to just put out an album without working on it. I dont think this one is even worth a DownLoad. It was one big let down.
3,No Page Avenue,"I personally loved Page Avenue. I listened to every track many, many times and each one had meaning and soul. This CD seems to be about the SAME subject each time: rising up against odds. I realize we live in scary times, but are there enough people opressing us that we need 12 cuts dedicated to it? The only really memorable song is the bonus track...it sounds alot like page avenue.What's sad is that I guess this is what they really wanted to do, which means their first album was nothing more than the record companies...no real soul. Hopefully they'll come out with a third CD that has more page avenue.With all that being said, I don't regret buying the album because ""take me back"" is a good song, so is ""wake up the voiceless"". I just wish there were more page avenue type songs."
2,"Not a bad 2nd release, but it's no ""Page Avenue""","i got the album because of how much i liked Page Avenue. It's nothing like i was expecting tho thats for sure, but not bad either. this album is alot more harder and heavier compared to page avenue. dont get me wrong its good, but i still liked page avenue better. i listen to all kinda music, everything from emo, scremo, punk, indie, metal, hardcore, to 80's pop songs. i like a bit of everything, and think this album is more for the fans or people who like heavier music, because it's nothing similar to page avenue and the lyrics from that album. so if your more into emo and screamo then their 2nd release isnt really for you."
3,AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS THIS?,"ok, let me make something clear. I don't know if this album is good or not, nor do i know if i like this band. but i just need to say that the song ""we don't care anymore"" is the corniest song i have heard in awhile. they are trying to be punk but aren't.the music video is also wierd, especially the guy with the headband. and the part in the song ""this love, i wont let it die"" comes out of nowhere and doesn't have anything to do with the song. the chorus sounds like something a little kid would write if he was mad about something."
3,Dissapointing,"This album is an overall let down. After Page Avenue they were easily my favorite band and I respected their unique sound tremendously. This album goes in a complete different direction, and although sometimes this is good for a veteran band who has 3 or 4 albums out, SOTY should have kept with a similar sound to their first album. This is definitely not worthy of purchasing - I'm just going to wait for their next album and hope they rethink their new sound."
3,Average,"This band is average. Most bands today are average. Nothing that different. Not to say this is a bad album, because it's not. But it's not ground breaking."
1,"I'm no longer a huge SOTY fan, just a huge PAGE AVENUE fan","Page Avenue simply put was one of the greatest albums in my oponion ever. EVERY song was amazing. I've probably listened to each of them thousands of times as i loved it that much. Their new cd is much different. They made the Cd they wanted this time, not the cd Maverick wanted like last time. Its totally different, no memorable songs, nothing. I am surprised at how many good reviews this CD has been given while in my mind i can't even force myself to like it. Take me BAck , our time is now, and wake up the voiceless are the only decent tracks. Big dissapointment waiting 2-3 years for something totally different. I longer am a huge Story of the Year fan, just a huge Page Avenue fan.CRAP"
4,Never too late to hit the road,"The author has done a lot of world travel, both before and after this journey (see his latest about his later years in the Peace Corps). This one rang a strong bell with me as I also traveled around the worldOn the Road in '68: A Year of Turmoil, A Journey of Friendship, tho a few decades earlier and younger. Both our trips were in low-cost lodging, non-group explorations, and meeting many locals and fellow wanderers (tho not too many others at his age of 75). Besides the experiences at these many locales, he includes quotes after each chapter that can stimulate readers (even colleagues of his maturity, with the right adventure spirit). Here's a favorite: ""Travel with many and you will meet few. Travel alone and surely you will meet many."" That matches my experience as you can read about in my book ""On the Road in ""68: a year of turmoil, a journey of friendship."" Check it out too."
1,Combi IV stroller and Combi-Int'l Company are awful,"I ordered this stroller through Amazon and upon receiveing it, had steering problems and the belt buckle was very difficult. Upon calling the company, I received very little response or help with their defective stroller. The steering on this stroller is very hard to manage. I would not recommend this stroller or this company to anyone."
1,Nice aesthetics - poor steering,"When I purchased this stroller, it sounded perfect. We took it out for a walk on the beach, it was impossible to turn and steer. This was a second stroller for my three year old boy - our Peg Perego Aria - although dirty and old works so much smoother. My husband has tried this stroller out too and told me to toss it or give it away. Don't waste your money!"
3,"Inexpensive. It works but fit in the neck is odd. Not bad, just odd.",I bought two of these for a couple of vintage JC Higgins cruisers. Since the stems are stamped and rolled they fit kind of odd. I'm going to buy the larger size and see if I can make them fit better. Overall it's an OK product but you are getting what you pay for.
5,I love it.it is the best cd ever,I love Ricki Martin he is the best artist ever. He has the voice and the looks.I wonder how would it be to be married to him. This song is one of the best ever I hope that in the future his songs would be bigger hits.
5,"If it's Ricky Martin, nothing but the BEST of PUERTO RICO","Ricky Martin, Talent, Looks, Puerto Rican, what more can you ask for. God has blessed him. He's got what it takes and there is more to come. All his music is GREAT!!!"
5,J'ai l'amour pour Ricky!,"C'est une tres grande chose quand une personne est une chantuese et aussi, une femme. Ricky Martin est une chantuese et une femme! Mais, malheuresement, si tu n'avais pas les devoirs pour mercredi, tu peux aller au la magasin et achetes des livres sur le sujet de M. Martin. Il est tres interessant! Merci beaucoup. Au revoir et j'espere que tu as un tres bon jour, aujourd'hui. Et si tu es depresse, c'est necessaire que tu achetes cet album des carmens."
3,Average,"It is a very pretty thermometer too bad the first one I received was inacurate and totally off on the actual temperature reading. I returned it and asked for an exchange, the second one I received was all scuffed up with one small scratch. I was able to remove the scuff marks so I kept it because this one works well. Amazon did a pretty lousy packaging job and I still have not gotten a response or apology to my packaging feedback I left with them."
1,Not what I ordered!,"Sadly, I bought this even after reading another review saying they had received a different thermometer. I figured it was a one-time mistake. Not so. I got this for my mom for her birthday - it's colorful and bright, perfect for her backyard! The thermometer I received had birds, but the colors are brown and beige and completely muted. It's different birds than on the one I ordered, and not nearly as fun! DO NOT order from these people if you want to receive the thermometer you see above."
4,An ESSENTIAL investigation of a devastating event,"The author's effort shines through in this work as someone genuinely concerned for the welfare of people. I say people as a general term because Anderson puts this horrific event into a context that shows how relevant it was and still is for humankind as a whole. The people of El Salvador suffered greatly in the 80's and 90's, but there was a precursory event 50 years before that was even in scope."
5,Best on institutionalism,"Woods and Cogdill were at that time the best representatives for the churches of christ that endorsed the church supported insitutions and the church that opposed the church suppported institutions. Woods affirms that the church can support and oversee human institutions like orhan homes, etc., while Cogdill asserts that the church is only authorized to relieve needy saints and not all the destitute of the world, for this would hinder the church from carrying out her main commission: preaching the gospel. This is also a good manual for those that are desiring to learn how to conduct a religious debate."
1,Shaun Disappoints Once Again,"OK, Here we have by far one of the most insightful and intellectual songwriters to come on the scene since Steven Curtis Chapman. Now that being said, why is an artist of Shaun's caliber only putting out mediocre work?. ""What's Wrong With This World"" is excellent. The only other two that are even o.k. are ""Hummingbird"" and ""Crave"". I am in no way condoning music piracy, but I can understand a lot of what downloaders are feeling when they purchase a c.d. and only get maybe 2-3 good songs off of it.Please Shaun, give us more of what you gave us on ""Invitation To Eavesdrop"""
1,Good band but this is bull,"The low score is not for the band itself. Chain of Strength is one of my favorite late 80s hardcore bands. The low score is for this release. Revelation, for some odd reason, felt it necessary to HEAVILY remix the original tracks off the two 7inches. The mixing of the songs off of ""what holds us apart"" are not completely horrible, but the ""true till death"" tracks do sound really bad. Not only that, but some of the intros off of the ""true till death"" 7inch songs have been completely cut off.Pretty much the only reason to buy this is to have their unreleased song ""impact"" which is quite good. Other than that, track down the original 7inches, or download them from somewhere. Just look for the names of the 7inches as the album names, instead of this garbage."
5,the one thing that still holds true?,"True till death? These guys weren't, but who is? It's a good thing that the music still holds up... otherwise this wouldn't even be in print. Get this if you like good, old fashioned, Southern California HxCx."
3,Mediocre Memories of Heartless Dribble,"The ""crew"" bands had all the formulaic approaches to making ""popular punk rock"". Their PMA (positive mental attitude) hit hard with the young crowd looking for something of their own to latch onto. Instead of worshipping a Minor Threat song, they should have used that influence to forge their own roads, not create a cult of being ""emo"" having an ""X"" on your hand. Musically this has some catchy tunes, but nothing really original or inspiring. It's predictable and lacks any real emotion. This stuff was made to sell to the masses and they took advantage of every gimmick such as colored wax and different covers. Pretty much a waste of time."
5,The Unexamined Life,"This is a great read. Not many novels can cause a person to see his/her life in a different light but this one is likely to. Just as topical today as when it was published. Some of Babbit's politics are very similar to the Republican Party and the Tea Party of the present. But it's not about politics, -it's about being a conformist and likely a coward. I can be as cowardly as the next person so I should know! Though I've read some novels that were just this good, I haven't read a better novel in the last year, -maybe the last decade."
2,I would pass on this watch,"I read all the reviews, people loved this watch, so I ordered it. I got it and trained with it for 3 weeks. I hated it. The display was limited to 3 lines of text, the altimeter had to be reset before every workout, the pods were ok, but i just thought not having them was a better solution. So I sold it and bought a Garmin 305 - and have loved it.The 305 does everything, the more time you spend with it, you wonder how u have trained without it. The GPS is awesome! I havent had any problems with connecting at all. Yes t6 it was smaller, but after getting used to the 305, I dont even notice its a little big now. And when on a bike I have it on the handlebar anyway, so no problem. I would recomend the 305 over the t6 hands down."
4,Nice seriuos training tool,This is the best option if you are looking for serious training without too many on line information. Most of useful information comes after the training with the PC interface. During the training you just have heart rate. If you are looking for on line information go to T3 or T4. Most of the parameters are really related with the heart rate becoming really usefull three of the seven parameters available after training. It is a robust option in comparison with T3 or T4 with additional weather and altitute capability.
5,T6,"Great training product....My favorite feature is the calorie counter. The only problem is you have to take it home and upload the info to the computer before you can see the calorie count. This product does so much more than I use it for; if you're serious about your training then you'll love it. Also bought the foot pod for outdoor running. Great paired with the watch. The only BAD thing about this product is if you need any kind of customer service or servicing of the product (i.e., change of battery), it is difficult to talk to an actual person. You have to send the product in to be fixed, but they are pretty prompt about getting it back to you. I've had two problems: 1) my chest strap cracked/ripped, so I had to send it in to get a new one (with no problem--it was under warranty), and 2) changing the battery. I would suggest just sending it in to the company to have them change it for you...it's way too confusing and difficult to deal with it yourself."
4,Heavy......yet good.,E.Town Concrete and their new album Made for War rock way heavier than their last c.d. which was too much of the rap/rock thing for me. This album is just straight up Metal with the exception of 1 track. If you're into real heavy metal pick this album up. It's worth it.
3,"Not their best, but still decent.","If you want to get a taste for this band pick up The Renaissance. It is probably the most varied of their albums, as it has everything they have done on the same cd. This one is good, but their are too many tracks that just sound like fill-ins. I think the album starts off well, but slowly declines until the last three songs. I can't say its better or worse than any of their other cd's, because it is so different. If you like more of a tough guy attitude, with a horrible rap thrown in, then this is for you. Overall, its a good album, but nothing to get excited over. I think they rushed too much to come out with it."
3,Coulda done better....,"Ive been listening to Etown since their first Ep. Since then the band has grown in many ways. Unfortunately in my opinion alot of their material from when they were younger is still their best. MADEFORWAR sticks to Etowns Thugcore sound, eliminating some rapping and replacing it with more metal. On this disc there are some standout tracks (""What can I do"", for one is an awesome song). ""Do you know what its like"" is a decent rap for what it is. ""Wide Awake, Ploughshares, and Made for WAr"" are all good hardcore/metal songs. However the rest of the songs are decent, but dont stand out in any way. Some of the lyrics are a little weak too. Check out TIME2SHINE (the bands first LP) if you want to hear some of Etown's most notable songs. THE RENAISSANCE is also a good cd. Honestly if i wasnt an Etown fan for so long, i probably wouldnt have bought this cd."
4,Roller blading detectives are at it a third time,"""Until it Hurts"" is Polly Whitney's third ""Until"" novel. This time the TV news director Abby Abagnarro and his ex-wife Ike Tagart are at New York City's Madison Square Garden. They are granted an interview by the Icemaan, a New York Knick player. The Garden floor is pelted with buckshot. The Iceman is dead but not from the gun shots. He has been knifed. There are other shootings and yet another murder. The two, both Abby and Ike, are bickering as they have in the other two ""Until"" books. Abby's attitude is bit more flip this time around and that's why I rated it as an ""8"" as opposed to ""9s"" on the two precious novels. As with ""Unil the End of Time"" and ""Until Death,"" ""Until it Hurts"" is worth the search for at booksellers and libraries. Get they now, read them and wait for the next ""Unil"" book which I hope is in the works."
3,Works Great,"February 3, 2006 - This pepper mill works great and is the best one I've ever used! Meant to give it 5 stars."
2,"Good design, poor execution","Like a number of the other reviewers, my mill only produces a very coarse pepper. The adjusting wheel on the bottom worked for a couple months but then stopped adjusting. Now it just turns and turns with no effect on the size of the grind. I wish it worked better because it's really easy to grind a lot of pepper fast with this....but only a very coarse grind."
5,A Pepper Mill That Works,"I bought this mill a year ago and it is going strong today. It is the first peppermill I have purchased that works every time with little effort. The end-cap helps keep it and the counter clean. The handle makes it easy to use if you have problems with your hands turning knobs.Update: I now have two of these now that we use daily because they are so good. I use one with Dutch oven cooking on my RV and at home. I have several other brands sitting around that never worked. This unit is not fancy, but is a real workhorse that is easy to use. Folks that say that they cannot get them to grind anything but coarse need to turn them over and turn the handle until the grinder is clean, then set the grinder wheel to a finer setting. Thsi is a good gift for a friend that cooks outdoors or the kitchen."
2,Can't get pepper!,"I grind, I grind- I get no pepper! I don't see how you can adjust it. I don't like it!"
5,Best Pepper Mill Ever,I have neuropathy and arthritis in my hands. Like many people I prefer to use a pepper mill but found it very difficult. I do not have strength in my hands and had just about decided I would not be able to use any pepper mill when I saw the Good Grips. I am thrilled with how easy it is to use. My hands do not cramp and turning the handle is almost effortless. The Good Grips is also a breeze to fill with peppercorns and there is no surprise because you can see when it is almost empty.Anyone with disabilities in their hands will find the mill easy to use.
2,Pretty good for a little while,"After about 6 months, it stopped grinding altogether! Just round and round it goes. Threw it out and now am searching for a good versatile pepper grinder that will not quit on me. Hope I find one."
5,Best Pepper Mill ever,I really like this new version of the OXO Good Grips Pepper Mill.It works great...better than the old one.
2,"OXO ""Fair"" Grip","Several years ago we purchased this item and found it to be great! However, now that we have purchased new ones to replace the old ones which don't work anymore for some mysterious reason, we find the ones we bought to replace the old ones work quite poorly - It seems this simple grinding mechanism should be no problem to get right, and yet we have difficulty grinding pepper with these 2 new replacments....the handle turns, but does not grind the pepper at all in one of the new ones, and grinds it only intermittently in the other. Very disappointed, as these are not cheap items, and we certainly expected them to work well. Not happy with this poor workmanship, OXO, and will not buy these again."
2,The challenge is... where are the Challs?,"Briefly, the story is cheesy and a little unbelievable, even for a novel based on rather fantastic comic book characters, even for a novel written in 1977. This book seems to miss the entire point of the Challengers of the Unknown, their origin, and their motivations. A couple of the characters are just missing their basic personalities entirely, to be filled in with humorous characterizations. The two plotlines in this book cross over each other on occasion - but have nothing to do with each other. They just happen to show up in the same story. And the deus ex machina devices stretch the boundaries of imagination. If you aren't a Challs fan, you likely won't like this novel; it isn't very engaging. If you ARE a fan of the Challs, please avoid this book; I've taken the bullet for you already."
4,"""Dead men are heavier than broken hearts.""","GREAT QUOTES. But I feel you would be better off reading them in the original text and picking out your own. Why should I think some guy has better taste than me ? Not likely. Some are missed and some others are not that great. The main problem with Chandler is he started writing late in life and just didn't write enough. No question he was THE BEST writer of hardboiled mystery detective fiction who ever wrote. So buy this it is good for a portable and write the quotes he missed on the blank pages.""Dead men are heavier than broken hearts."""
3,O.K. little book,"This is a good little book for Marlowe fans, but the cost for the volume is too high. It is one of those books you will read once and never open again."
2,A small book of RC quotations.,"If you want a handy book of Raymond Chandler's quotations, this might be OK. I was a bit disappointed at it's small size and large price. Money would be better spent buying and reading RC's superb omnibus collection. Hardly a page goes by without a worthy quotation."
3,midsomer murders set 13,"i have every one of the sets of mm. i was pleased with all until set 13, especially the episode with the motorcycle clown. this one was so boring. i suppose you have to like noise and motorcycles to enjoy this one. not sure i will order the rest as with some series they can go down hill as they come to a close.john nettles made the series good, but i think it's time for him to retire as he seems tired of this.shame.i might add the beginning sets seemed more mysterous and interesting. these latter ones just want to talk one to death which never works for me in a mystery, they need to be more visual. anyone agree? my 2 cents! jm USA"
5,Murder and beautiful scenery,"I love Midsomer Murders and look forward to each set. Now that I know that John Nettles is going to be gone within the next few sets, I love them even more. Grisly murders somehow manage to overwhelm these little villages, and there is always a new twist. The family, the drama, the theatre, the scenery. It is all wonderful. Somehow there are little lessons imbedded in each story, but mostly it is just wonderful whimsey (or gore)"
3,Somewhat Disapppointing,"I have watched most of the earlier series. But, I found this series to be a bit boring, especially ""Dance with the Dead"" and ""The Axeman Cometh"". There was very little in the investigation of the murder and too much of what I call filler. Somewhat disappointing."
5,Midsomer Murders 13,This was a present for my son since he loves the old english type murders and so he loved this one for his birthday. He like it also for it is in England area and similar to other mysteries and great senery of England and the thached roof of the homes ...anyway its a great buy if you like the series of Midsomer Murders and they seem to have many of them...lol
5,And the murders go on,Midsomer is where Miss Marple would live if she were with us today. I can't think of a single episode that disappointed me.
3,don't expect too much,"Don't expect to be able to capture the stitching on a football during mid-catch from the sidelines with this, but it does exactly what it advertises, magnifying the normal lens by 2x. The caveats are important though: it renders the built-in flash useless, but more importantly, it renders the viewfinder useless as well. This makes taking pictures of moving objects especially difficult, as you need to watch them on the LCD screen. (try doing this in bright sunlight for a real challenge) If your photo requirements are just a little more zoom than default, and you're taking mostly photos of static objects, this lens should perform perfectly for you. Just be aware of its limitations."
1,lousy with MP3 files,"I've had this player about 2 weeks. Radio is decent. Plays audio CDs okay. However, it will not play MP3 files in the correct order. There doesn't seem to be a logical basis for the order of the tracks as it plays them. It ignores the 'playlists' that are on the MP3CDs altogether. If that doesn't matter to you, then it might be okay. I think it stinks.I'll probably switch to Sony, which has its own (better) compression technology anyway."
4,I like Joyce Meyers Books,I bought this for my girlfriend. I haven't read it but she is reading it and she likes it. Go for it.
4,Exactly what I ordered,"This is an old book so, of course, it looks old, but is still in great shape. Very pleased with item"
3,Good memories of Steve!,My daugther was a huge fan of Steve and I bought this for her more as a commemorative item (she is really too old for the toy). It is very durable.
4,"Information on Harry's CD ""Sequel""","This is more in the way of information than a review of this collection. A couple of reviews back there was a wish that the album ""Sequel"" would come out on CD.It did. actually. It was released on Dunhill, and the title was changed to ""Remember When the Music"", their catalog number was DZS035 . It's an excellent remastering, but Idon't know if it's in print any more."
5,Fabulous set,"This new collection is a MUST for Chapin fans. Sure, you may have these songs on existing CD's, but they have been re-mastered and sound great. Moreover, the book that accompanies the 3 CD's is wonderful. Lots of neat photos from Chapin family that have never been published before. Jen's tribute to her dad is beautiful. Get this set!"
3,"Good, but 30,000 lbs. of Bananas (live) song distasteful","I gave this collection only three stars because of the inclusion of the live version of 30,000 Pounds of Bananas. I found that version of that song very unsettling, making a mockery of a solemn song. If you are not familiar with the song, it is about an actual truck driver who loses control of his truck carrying 30,000 lbs. of bananas and dies. It seems that the audiences found it funny, so Harry decided to play to that audience appeal. I am attracted to Chapin's work because it is made up of stories that give cause for reflection. I had heard the original song many times and thought it was quite good. But I received this collection yesterday and was appalled at the treatment he gave this song. The story aspect of the song is destroyed in the ""fun"" that Harry seems to have found in it. The original version of should have been included in this collection. Big disappointment."
5,An Excellent Compilation,"As a lifelong Harry Chapin fan, I have been frustrated for many years at the absence of his best work from CD. This collection captures the essence of his work from his best known songs such as Taxi and Cats in the Cradle to lesser known (but better) works as well. Of particular note is the excellent sound quality as compared with earlier collections. This should easily have been a 4-CD collection. One can only hope that this collection is a success so that Harry's other albums, such as Short Stories, Sequel and Legends of the Lost and Found (in my opinion, the superior ""live album)are released. However, for those wanting a rounded collection of Harry Chapin's work, this is it."
1,Infomercial Alert: Avoid at all costs!,Warning!! This is a 39 minute informercial. There are no tutuorials of any kind on this tape (which claims to be an hour in length on the packaging). The back of the video packaging claims that the infomercial is followed by another tutorial program...but that is not included on the tape. I bought this tape expecting specific technical tutorials -- but it is just a sales pitch for Jim Petulla's Career Connection program.
4,nice gift,Will be watching for price on this item so we can buy more. Meanwhile four are drinking out of three glasses.
5,Great Book,I am a current instructor and have sat in on a course dealing with Flash ActionScripting with Norbert and I have found his book to be very helpful and useful in learning both the program and the ActionScripting.The information is presented in a very clear and precise manner and they provide various sites that discuss the information taught in each chapter so that you can see how the information given actually pertains to the topic.I highly recommend this book for anyone just starting to learn Flash and for those who have some Flash knowledge and just wants to go a little further with their programming skills.
2,Really not great,"This book just doesn't cut it -- they went way too far trying to make it easy to read and so lost much of the value of a technical guide book.An example, you ask? From page 104: ""Based in the great city of Vancouver, in the wonderful province of British Columbia, in the beautiful country of Canada, Atomic Cartoons...""That ridiculous style of writing wouldn't have made it past my 8th grade english teacher, and it certainly doesn't belong in a technical instruction book.If you have any technical background, including familiarity with any Macromedia products--in fact I would go so far as to say if you've ever even seen the Flash interface without trembling in confusion--this is not the book for you.Unlike their description of Vancouver BC, this book is not great, wonderful, nor is it beautiful. It's really just fluff.(I give it a 2 only because it may be more useful to someone who's never seen Flash or is really new to any type of development.)"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"The actual rating is MINUS 5 stars. This book sucks. The stupid CD DOES NOT WORK on PC. Finally I copied it from my Mac. More surprises. Some chapters, IMPORTANT ONES, ARE MISSING. Without completing these chapters, you can't move on. I am throwing my book away in disgust. I'm heading out to buy a book that actually works.People who can't even program their own CDs shoudn't write ""How to"" manuals."
3,A Video Worth Playing,"This is a nice Star Trek episode, in the classic style of discovering new life and new civilizations.Sisko and his crew do not often ""boldly go"" anywhere in the first few seasons (being grounded by Starfleet to DS9?), but every once in a while a new species will happen upon the promenade. In this case, it's the Wadi, the first formal contact between a Gamma quadrant species and the Federation. In the Wadi's culture, games and gaming is everything, and cheating the greatest crime. Enter Quark... stage left...After Quark is discovered cheating, Sisko, Dax, Bashir and Kira are punished for the Ferengi's crime, and placed in a maze, forced to face numerous challenges and perils...This is a nice little episode. It was refreshing to encounter a Trek culture not obsessed with war and the military, nor suffering from the same. It really does not act as a lead in to other episodes, but that's ok..."
4,I liked this episode,"This episode was pretty good! Sisko, Dax, Kira and Bashir gets traped in a game due to Quarks cheating at his bar."
3,Interesting book on Gambit play,"Gambit Play by Angus Dunnington is an interesting book. The author has several game selections that illustrate the use of gambits for; Time, Open lines, The Initiative, Outposts, Distruption and Structure. Many of the games feature icons from the world of Chess including Anderssen (my personel favorite), Morphy, Kasparov, Kramnik, Fisher, Tartakower, Spassky etc..I find the annotation very clear and concise. The author gets his point across and there are many diagrams to help along the way.This book is not intended to be an book on exact openings but does show how to gain compensation for giving up a pawn or two early on.The final chapter of the book has several miniature games that are instructive and very entertaining.In closing, I am not an chess master and feel that this book is very valuable for someone of my level. I would be intersted to see what a more experienced player thinks of this work."
4,Pretty good for younger children,"I had to do a report a few years ago on shirley, and I would recomend this book for children who want to do a report on shirley, or just learn interesting facts about her and her career. so i would definitley look over the book, it is really heplful!!!!"
2,Tonnage of verbiage,"A confusing, perplexed philosophical and psychological character study of the fur trapper, trader and Indian. The verbose and jumbled writing style is what hinders the attention of the reader in this overblown look into who meant what, when saying this about that, about whoever or whatever! Rarely ever do I not finish a book, but after struggling halfway through this mumbo-jumbo quibble of entangled hairsplitting speculations and conjectures, I laid it to rest. I gave it two stars for the bibliography."
3,time changing,"it works, it wakes my husband up.. the only problem were having it the time keeps going off track. He has to reset it every night because its always an hour or more off."
5,screaming meanie,The screaming meanie is a very good item. I work night shift and farm during the day time so I only get a few hours of sleep a day and I sleep thru all the other alarms I have. I cant sleep thru this!!!
4,Very Loud!,"Kind of hard to get use to the settings, but this can wake your neighbors... practice turning it off before you sleep."
3,A pain to use but it works,"I bought this unit because I can't rely on motel wake-up services. It works well, is loud enough but is a pain in the butt to operate. You must input the wake up time EACH TIME YOU USE IT! Must push 3 buttons simultaneously to turn it off."
4,Nice timer,"I purchased this item to use as a countdown timer for sports teams. It works very well, although I would make it a little easier to turn off (currently you need to press three buttons at the same time) and it would work better for my uses if the 5 minute and 10 minute warnings would automatically turn off like some of the other times I have used in the past. I do like the adjustable audible volume settings and the unit seems very durable."
3,Not too great but really loud.,I bought this for my son because he has a hard time hearing his other one. It's battery ran. Hard to set up and turn off. I can't get him to use it.
4,Extral loud! Scares you out of bed!,Drawbacks: have to reset alarm each night. Battery doesn't last long - have had about a month & had to replace
5,Alarm Clock that Actually wakes me up!,Great alarm clock and easy to use. Middle setting is definitely loud enough to wake me up. I recommend this alarm clock for hard to wake up sleepers.
2,Certainly loud but lacking in other features,This gizmo sure is loud! Loudness is one of the few redeeming qualities this alarm has got going. The problem with this product is that unlike a typical alarm clock where the wake-up time is saved - you need to reset the alarm everytime that it goes off. Another drawback is that it only runs on battery.
3,Product dimensions kinda mis leading,I have to say this is absolutely a quality panel as the other person identified. My only problem is the product dimensions is for the box it came in and not the actual depth of the panel. I was wanting a box that was 5.5 inches not the standard 3.5 inches. I wish it identified the actual panel dimensions and not the packaging dimensions.
3,Eric Tamm: From Musicologist to Pedagogue,"Alright, that title was a bit harsh. I did like the book overall. I found Mr. Tamm's initial level of dissection vis-a-vis Crimson to be a bit much for my liking, and didn't really feel that the book 'took off' until it became a diary of his experiences at one of Robert Fripp's Guitar Craft seminars.The personal interpretation of the Guitar Craft process described by Mr. Tamm is a much more interesting and enjoyable read than the cold discussion of theory that precedes it.If you're interested in Robert Fripp, King Crimson, or Guitar Craft, then your time will not be wasted."
2,Blame it on the weather,"Maybe it was because of the weather. It was difficult to get into the stifling heat of August in Rome when you are in chilly Scotland in December.This is the first story in a series concerning Nic Costa, the youthful police detective. There is a grisly series of murders, an attractive mysterious woman, links to The Vatican and the mob; a good mix for a thriller. But I just didn't warm to this one. I don't want to give too much away but for me there was a central part of the plot that just didn't sit well.There is a good cast of characters, I liked Nic's father and his expounding on the wisdom of dogs, but I felt the two main characters, Nic and his femme fatale were a bit shallow.I thought Villa of Mysteries, ""episode two"" was much better. It was interesting to catch up on the background however."
3,Stop with this one,"After reading Sacred Cut, Hewson's third Nic Costa book, I went back to read the first two, hoping to figure out how Sacred Cut could ever have been published.Actually, this one, the first, also turns out to be the best of the lot. Hewson works at giving his characters some personality and depth, develops a plot as believable as most in this genre, uses his setting well, and generally keeps the reader's interest. So taken as a solo novel, A Season For the Dead is a decent read, which earns maybe a B-."
4,glad I kept reading,"I wasn't too sure when I first started to read this. I didn't care much for Nic Costa or anyone else in the story at the start but the plot was written well enough to keep me reading, and I am very glad that I did. With each chapter I found myself starting to like Nic Costa more and more and was anxious to get home a night to read the next chapter. I really did enjoy this book and I'm looking forward to reading the other books in the Nic Costa series."
3,Not the Best Written Novel on Vatican,"Warning to readers: this is not even close to The DaVinci code and some parts of mutilations and mutilated bodies are grossly depicted. I have to give a high point on Hewson's style of writing, but they are just too overwhelming.Hewson exploited his deep knowledge on locations in both Rome and the Vatican convincingly. Characters were described meticulously, sometimes overly detailed, hence too lenghty. That is where I reduce my grading on this novel.The first installment of Nic Costa police detective story is interesting, but not THAT good. I am actually inclined to appoint this novel a 3.5 star recommendation, since 3.5 stars option is unavailable, have to settle for a three-star."
5,Spoken Like a True Roman...Thriller,"Put me down as a devoted admirer of David Hewson. My first book was Lucifer's Shadow with fast-past intrigue running through a gamet of historical backgrounds. Superbly written. This year, I picked up his first Nic Costa novel which captivated my senses and transported me to the sights, aromas and well, being a Roman in Rome. Hewson makes you part of the city. You breathe it and inhale it's intoxication. The characters are as colorful and interesting as the city setting. This volume sets the stage for your future ""theater of the mind"" adventures with Nic Costa. Enjoy."
3,A disappointment.,"This book starts off extremely well, with engaging characters and interesting detail. But then the focus changes, and itbecomes very dark, briefly sexually explicit, and for the most part, dull.If you're looking for a good mystery set in Rome, you might want to try any of those by Elizabeth Peters, Nagaio Marsh, Dan Brown or Ian Pears instead."
1,Another Vatican Conspiracy,"What would conspiracy buffs do without the Vatican. One thing for sure, they would have to be a lot more creative. The author is a talented writer, no question, but the silly plot in this ""thriller"" reveals a serious case of anti-catholicism. Oh, I forgot, it's not about the church; it's about the Vatican, an independent country that's depicted here as infinitely more corrupt than Italy or any Italian politican, or, I guess, on a level with the governments of Burma and Afghanistan. Obviously, most of the reviews posted rate this work much higher, but my view is that the absurd plot and mostly weak characterizations doom this one to a one star."
2,Cliched and unbelievable.,If you neither admire nor appreciate good writing and are prepared to put up with cliched characters who don't inspire empathy then you just might get something positive out of this.
4,"Literate, compelling, just short of paradise","David Hewson's first book in what promises to be a rewarding series is literate and compelling. The only problem I had with it is the character of Sara Farnese, who, as the book unfolds, turns out to be more and more a character molded by the needs of the plot and less and less plausible as a humn being. That's a shame, but the other characters become more and more human, vivid, plausible, and impressive. I immediately began the second volume of the series, and will read any further installments as they appear."
3,Not too shabby,"Hewson doesn't hit a home run with this novel, but he at least gets to first base. Although this book has some stilted language it was pretty interesting. I can think of at least 400-500 other books I would recommend before this one, but if you are the type of reader who has read virtually every historical type thriller out there you might want to pick this up."
5,Archipelago Soy Lotion,This moisturizer is the best I have ever used - it keeps your skin soft but not greasy - it has a nice smell and I carry a small bottle of it with me at all times - I am thankful that Amazon has it available because I live in South Florida and there isn't a store anywhere around that carries it - I first discovered this lotion while vacationing in the mountains - so thank you Amazon for carrying this product -
1,Not What I Expected,This DVD needs a serious update.Not pleasing to the eyes and it did not keep my attention.DVD is not for a beginner.Signs are executed too quickly.The zoo scenes are too lonnnnnnnnnnng.My intention were to purchase a DVD to learn sign language not a DVD on animal planet.I did not enjoy signing DVD and it took everything in me to complete one session.I cannot recommend this DVD to anyone.
2,"For toddlers, not adults unless you want to practice sign to voice","This is for really little kids, and that's it. It is boring for adults. There is a small little section on learning signs, that could only capture the interest of toddlers. It is a video fieldtrip mostly; focused on amimals more than teaching. How long do I want to watch a caged animal? I can go to the zoo for that and it be much more fun. Anyway... The narrator is Deaf, but there is voice over. So the only adults to watch to get anything out of this video would be the ""signed narration"" for interpreter students who want to practice their sign-to-voice by muting the sound."
1,Not worth the money,I bought this dvd so my kids (6 & 10) could continue their sign language studies over the summer. They got nothing out of it! It is not a beginning course...it really teaches nothing...very disappointing.
2,For Kids only,"I thought this DVD would help me with american sign language as I am a beginner. I felt like a child as I watched the illustrations. I couldn't quite understand the zoo stuff. It did teach some words but not enough, way to much focus on the field trips."
2,The Everglades and The Florida Keys (DVD),"I have done a lot of reading about the Everglades and southern Florida; I find the material fascinating. But I have never seen the area and probably won't. I had hoped I was purchasing a DVD of scenery, traveling through the area by boat, a little history, etc. I also hoped to see a few of the homes and people living inside the Big Swamp, but that is not the intent of this DVD. It focuses on the animal life of the area with up-close pictures of their daily life, including mating and feeding habits. The animal photography is excellent,very suitable for using in a teaching setting. But not the travelog I had hoped for. The product description should have been more accurate. The cost is high."
2,Inspect these carefully,"Both my pans had scrapes- one on the outside, which is just ugly, and one on the inside- which is bad for baking, since the coating would have come off in the food. I like the design, since I love hanging it on my pot rack- but I wish I didn't have to mess with returning on of the pans because of the scrape, caused by bad packing."
3,Good Clean Hip Hop,"I teach dance classes and like to use the Hip Hope CD's because I know they will have clean lyrics. This one is pretty good, though some of the songs are a little heavy. I like the more dance-able hip hop. There are probably 4 songs like that on here. Overall the CD is good though."
4,Great live too!,These guys are laid back - funky - and full of soul. If you get a chance to see them live - go for it... great music and they're funny as hell too!
3,Not Very Informative,There were a few things I learned from reading this purchase but to be honest if you want to learn more detailed information go to a more informative book about specif orchids. It's a good book for beginners. I enjoined the read.
2,Orchids,"I did not find this book to be very helpful. There wasn't enough information about the kinds of orchids that I have. The info is very basic, good for a newbie."
3,It was okay.,We watched it for our New Year's Eve service and it was okay. Praise The Lord for Christian films but they can be kind of slow sometimes.
3,"nice plot, acting leaves something to be desired",The premise of this movie was wonderful. its a great family film that promotes good values and Christian principles. The acting left a lot to be desired however... a LOT!
1,damaged,The movie was a good theme but the voice was not in synch with the words. Hard for all of us to watch
5,Miltown Pride,"I really enjoyed the simplicity of the story. It was a great production and the Billy Sunday portrayal was very believable. Was disappointed that the end was not possible. The hero came up to bat in the wrong order for a true baseball game. Since there was not a double switch he would have been the ninth player to bat after his insertion into he lineup, he was eighth. But other than that it was great."
4,mallory 4070 install,"Install went fine, the pump works as it should, I haven't had a chance to race it yet, so can't say that it helps but I think it will. The regulator I picked up at a swapmeet works but leaks, so had to eliminate that. For some reason the base plate is not sealing."
3,Not the best lasers text out there:,"This book is intended for a graduate-level course on lasers. While covering a number of subjects in depth, there are a large number of mistakes. There has been two reprintings with corrections, so I would hate to have seen the first printing. There are many mistakes in the equations (usually easily ferreted out) as well as in the problems. The problems can be very frustrating as they are often as clear as mud. Overall however, the book does do a good job of covering most topics, but if you are looking for a better lasers book, I would go with Verdeyen's Laser Electronics (ISBN:013706666X) or Siegman's Lasers (ISBN: 0935702113)"
1,Swindler!,"A very small boek consisting 28 pages (copie). Did not receive The Grapho-Deck!I paid $19,95 and I really feel cheated!!!"
5,Abit about Bart Baggets Grapho Deck.,If you would like to learn how to analise handwriting this is just the way.This Deck focoses on things one at a time to know exactly how to deal with the person who ownes the handwriting.have fun-
4,Why buy four tracks?,"This software is exactly what it claims to be. It is a very versatile, easy-to-use package. The ease with which you can put things down, mix them, and burn them is excellent. With this software there is no reason to buy an analog four or eight track. The only complaint I could have is that the documentation included in the package is almost completely non-existant. If you have never recorded on a four track, you will be nearly completely lost. If you've used a typical four or eight track recorder, most everything is intuitive, but you will still have to experiement or look on line to get all your questions answered and use its full functionality."
2,No XP support....,Purchased this about a year and a half ago...just got a new computer running XP...this is not compatible. No updates available from Cakewalk but they did suggest I purchase one of their NEWER products that is XP compatible.
1,Never available - don't bother,"I had the same problem as everyone else in getting any of the Infantastic dvds from Amazon. I waited over two months, kept getting reassured that they were still coming, and then discovered one day that they had simply canceled my order without letting me know. Not only did no one ever offer to check with the company directly for the source of the problem or actual anticipated wait itme, but Amazon continues to post these items on their web site with a delivery date of 7-11 days, which is at best a misrepresentation, and at worst a complete lie because they are well aware that they can't provide the product at all at this point.I don't really care whose fault it is that the product is never available - Amazon needs to stop posting these dvds for purchase until they are confident the orders can be filled in the time noted."
3,"Worth the Wait, Even Though it Was Broken!","I also waited months to receive this DVD. And while it is great, and I use it every other day, there are three sections where it automatically goes back to the main menu, right in the middle of your workout! This happens with my Dance Baby Dance DVD by Infantastic as well! It is really annoying to stop working out, put the baby down, and fast forward to where you left off. So I'm torn. On the one hand I feel like I am getting stronger everyday, and my baby adores both videos. But on the other hand, I waited so long only to find that there is something is obviously wrong with the company if they put out two bad DVDs. What are the chances that I would just happen to get the only 2 defective copies they made? I didn't even order them at the same time. Also, I have an extensive library of workout DVDs and I have never had this problem. So I guess the message is ""Buyer Beware!"""
2,"Ok, if you've never exercised before.","I bought this video hoping it would help my postpartum body recover and get into better shape. I worked out 45 min to an hour, 5 days a week before becoming pregnant and found this video MUCH too easy. After reading the reviews, I thought it would be a good place to start. What really dissapointed me was the repetetive instruction for each exercise that you have to watch before performing the actual exercise. There should be an option to skip this part. The quiet, classical music leaves alot to be desired as well. In addition, your baby must be sitting up to perform the majority of the exercises. I used weights instead since my baby is too young for me to perform these exercises safely with him. Overall, I am very dissapointed in this video. It leaves alot to be desired."
3,"Just ok. Turn on the radio, put baby in your arms, and dance.","Just like any first time mom, I tried to get my hands on what ever stuff I could. This DVD is ok but all you need to do is turn on any music with a beat and simply hold your baby and bop around your living room. Do some lunges and squats to the beat, even skipa little, maybe a spin and a dip, what ever gets your little one excited and trust me, it's enough to raise your heart rate too. This DVD is cute but really, just do it yourself. (but be gentle with the baby PLEASE!!)"
1,Not a fan,I did not like this dvd one bit. To do the workout you have to repeat each segment the allotted number of times which is really a pain in the rear. I disliked this dvd so much I am turning around and selling it. There also way too much talking. If I wanted talking I would just turn on the tv and sit on my butt.
5,History Timeline,As a World History teacher this is an awesome resource for my classroom!!I actually purchased two of these books and cut the timeline out of both. I had them both laminated and I hung them in my classroom. One side is an amazing timeline of world history which I love because you can see at any given date what is going on all over the world... not just in Europe or America. The other side has the major countries in Europe and their Absolute monarch's family trees. I was so excited when I found this book because it's absolutely what I was looking for! I have other posters in my room- but this stays up all year and is a useful tool all year!!
4,A Picture of History,"This is a flowchart of the kings and kingdoms of history for 6,000 years.It shows the rise and fall of Rome and other kingdoms starting from Adam and Eve through the year 2000."
3,"Nice, but a bit too much of a Christian focus -- is it factual or ideological?","This is a beautiful book, that is a timeline chart based on an extension of a very old Victorian chart. With that being said I fully understand why the emphasis is on the Bible and Christianity, HOWEVER, I wish that other religions (Islam, Hindu, etc) were included. As a scientist myself, I am very interested in listening to all viewpoints and historical facts if possible. The book is still worth the purchase though since you can spend fruitful hours exploring the time chart."
3,Stop Making Sense,"Well, this one was not as good as the ones that came before it. Let's face it.However, there are still brilliant moments here...I especially liked their depiction of Billville - it reminded me a lot of Frank Zappa's song ""Society Pages."" But the lyrics are so wonderful:""Billville, BillvilleThe town that nature forgot to hate.Billville, Billville,You move to Billville because it's your fate.""Where else can you get this kind of insight than from the Brothers Firesign?And when, oh when, will Garrison Keillor ever acknowledge his just debt to these men, almost his exact contemporaries in age and in worldview??"
1,Firesign or Fire-Safe?,"The boys once again play it safe.Please note that several other reviews are written by known co-workers of the artist (Richard Fish engineered several radio shows for them). Please take a close look at who is writing the positive reviews.I do love these guys, but this is not a first rate effort by this great group. I wish they would REALLY let loose and do something worthy of the eariler stuff, but I doubt they will.The writing suffers from not enough effort to get you to be interested in any of the characters. Sure, there are some good moments, but a Firesegn disc should make you want to enter the world they create. I just wanted to run from it this time."
2,The AC from Hell,"I have had a Sharp AF-R55CX air conditioner for three 3 years, and it worked great (quiet and efficient) until my recent move. To repair would've cost me more than buying a new AC, so I purchased a new one, Sharp AF-S80FX. Started using it, and the first thing I noticed was its enormous noise (it sounds like a damn train). We called Sharp, and the representative told me that it's supposed to be really quiet - so she gave me a number for a service center. The person came (nice guy) and poked around, opened the machine and told us that there's nothing we can do about it - it's just this loud. The inside of this AC is made of styrofoam - I have no idea how and why, but it's a big reason for the unbearable noise. The service center guy told me that my old Sharp is of much better built (I got it cheaper than this new model). I hate to be so negative about this, but I'm just a little upset right now."
1,Poorly constructed book,I don't know what the photographer/author and publisher had in mind publishing this book other than the title and photos inside with a make-shift narrative constructed from subtitles and appendices. The photographer/authors photo in the rear jacket says it all for his state of mind.
5,Flesh and Bones,"""A passionate exponent of more human solutions to the problems of illegal border crossings...John Annerino, an Arizona writer-photojournalist, tells the story up close and personal in a gut wrenching, bare knuckle account...His account puts flesh and bones on the story behind the dreams, and skeletons,too,"" Desert Candle."
5,We have a Winner!,"Just the ticket for Santuko and Kudomono and other Asian profile blades. Took me half an hour to put my wife's 5 Asian Henckels (Pro S) and two Wusthof's back in good order. Even though we use the proper steel technique after every use, there still needs to be a periodic removal of work-hardened steel on the edge."
2,"A few nice vistas, relaxing music and views, that's it.","The pros: There are a few beautiful views of Maui in this video. It's very relaxing.The cons: There are so many beautiful places on Maui. Why not show more of them? Why repeat the same shot, instead of shooting something new? Hey, it's not a small island, it's even biger than Oahu. What kept you from driving around the island and taking more shots? Gas prices too high?Also, a video like this could gain a lot from a high definition format.My conclusion: it's a decent video DVD with a few beautiful vistas of Maui. But you could do a better video on your own, especially if using one of those HD cameras, which are getting more and more affordable nowadays."
4,Never Read First Person,"unless it's this one. This book was great, you should have seen my face when I realized this book was in first person, I really don't like just being in one person's head but Shari Shattuck, took me there with this can't put down romance, intrigue and all around good read. It only took me five hours to read and thats with breaks. I was so involved with who was out to get the Heroine, and I loved the Hero for mostly waiting to other oblegations to be finished, like finding out who was trying to kill her. Even though there was an abundance of characters each had their own tone, even in the first person prespective. I can't wait for the next book!"
3,Bad start...but enjoyed it in the end,"Not even sure how to write this review, like the book it was a mix.This book started out so bad I almost tossed it after the first few chapters. However, after 1/4 of the way into the book Cally Wilde, the main character, became likeable and the writing (plus the story) changed enough and made me want to finish the book. At the start of the book I felt like was going to be a paper version of Lindsey Lohan or some other cracked up ""it girl"". Cally ended up being a non-typical rich Daddy's girl and actually became likeable. The love interest, Evan was ubber hot and they had great chemistry (although, his financial status for a cop was a huge stretch of the imagination). In the end, I enjoyed the book and glad I didn't toss it...even if the red herrings & villains were too many and convoluted (everybody basically was involved!). After I read the book, I told a friend it reads like a soap opera, only later to find out the author was a soap actress...made sense."
3,Bad start and some predictible plot twists,"I had a hard time with the beginning of the book. The main character was extremely unlikable and I almost put it down. I'm glad I didn't because it (and she) did improve and I enjoyed the ride, although it was somewhat predictable. I knew who did it and why the moment their character was introduced and I'm not usually good at guessing that."
4,Hope they are back,"I think ASIA was one of the great rock bands of all time. They are easy to criticize but what is there not to like? Great lyrics, great music, great singing.... ASIA pre-Payne is still my most enjoyable music off the shelf. I have continued to follow Wetton on his solo journey. I miss having a strong CD from beginning to end and was hoping ICON would be it. It is not but it is a start. The songs and lyrics are thoughtful and well produced but I also wanted them to let go a bit and have some fun. There are some tracks here that are some of their best but overall it doesn't stand up to their original '90s CDs as ASIA. This is just a teaser though. I want another CD from these two ICONs of rock!"
1,Nothing ICONic to it,"Maybe we're spoiled, after 80s masterpieces like ALPHA and ASTRA, to expect equally ernergetic, eclectic inspired work from Wetton/Downes in 2005. But having listened to ICON five times this weekend, I must admit that, in toto, it sounds as weak and uninspired like the last three Wetton solo albums.Overture"" is a typical 70s meditation soundtrack, but on more valium. Let me go""does not exist, however the lack of structure and edge makes it perfect elevator music. Same w/Far Away, Sleep Angel, and the rest of this 11 track cliché collection.If it wasn't these two credible names, this project would never have made it to the record store. Any young band who would dare to deliver such flat crap, would not even be noticed. There's nothing iconic to it."
5,The Fourth Asia Album,"Anyone who loves The first 3 Asia albums will love Icon.John Wetton and Geoff Downes are a writing team that are rivalled only by Lennon and McCartney.Geoff's keys and John,bass and vox are unparallelled.John Mitchell,the guitarist on Icon is one of the greats.He is the guitarist for Arena and the singer guitarist for Kino.This is not a forum to knock other people,but the previous 2 reviewers are being disingenuous.They have some type of agenda. Anyone with knowledge of the history of the Band Asia,can figure out what's going on here.Hopefully Amazon can put some sound bytes up and everyone can judge Icon for themselves."
2,ASIA minor,"No hidden AgendA here. I posted a slim review at JW's site and was branded a JP fan. Nothing could be further from the truth. John Wetton has been a inspirational force in my own musical career. SO, I was looking forward to this CD with baited breath. I even spent the extra dough and ordered it from Japan. When it arrived I tore open the box, ripped off the celephane and popped the CD into my player. Now, I was not expecting ASIA, but considering the songs they gave us during the 80's, I was expecting more. It NEVER delivered. The songs are mundane and forgetable. No, I do not own a post Wetton ASIA offering, so I can't even compare it what I call the ""Geoff Downes band"" The use of JW's backing band is also a minus on the album. It made the disc sound more like a JW solo album then the team that gave us the anthems of the first 3 ASIA albums. I know we all grow and mature, but there was nothing on Icon that could even break into radio on either side of the Pond."
3,Keep the volume control handy,"This movie has a lot going for it, but it also has some serious problems with the sound. It goes from a whisper or mumbling to screaming or other loud noises constantly, and as a result I was constantly adjusting the volume. Even with that, I still missed a lot of the dialog. I tried to turn on the subtitles so at least I could read what I was missing, but there aren't any subtitles.That said, this movie tells a very important story. Not just the horrors of rendition and torture, but it also gives us some insights into what the aftermath must be like for torture victims."
4,An interesting persepective of the 13th generation.,"An interesting perspective of those belonging to the 13th generation. Provides a non-traditional perception of the generation in terms of atitudes, styles, beliefs, perspectives, etc. in a non-traditional form and style of writing. Simply put it is a fun and interesting piece of reading that portrays this generation in a way that has never been thought of before. The text is accompanied by creative cartoons and quotes that work to enhance the interest and understanding of the reading."
3,"From the viewpoint of young 13ers, we were offended.","A book filled with random quotes and cartoons throughout the text is filled with information agreeable and disagreeable to us. We felt that our generation is materialistic and the concept of ""premature affluence"" was relevant. We agree that the older generations think we are ""dumb, slackers."" We disagree with points such as 13ers being drug-addicted and having no future careers(just McDonalds Workers). The book isn't about our age group. It is generalized on certain groups of kids in our generation(the bad kids). We recommend that the book be updated. It is more about the older part of our generation than about us(mostly about teens of the 80s). Overall, we didn't agree or like the book 13th Gen."
4,"Lots of research, lots of it depressing, no magic bullet","I thought the approach was terrific, with a 13th Gen ""Crasher"" breaking in with commentary on the ""2boomers."" That's exactly the way it happens in my family: I was born in 1963, the ultimate ""oops"" birth year that led to crime peaks and the SAT score valleys, and I crash the happy glow of my five older boomer siblings. I know this book is necessary, because when I started to tell a boomer friend of mine about it, she immediately, and without hesitation, tried to expropriate all the commentary as applying to herself. It will take many more books like this to get boomers out of self-absorption; that, or we'll have to wait until they're all dead or drooling. The only thing I missed was some guidepost to accepting our fate. It's helpful to learn there were generations past that also were designed to struggle, for instance, but more comforting words about how to enjoy it would have been welcome."
3,"Oi, padre, what's with the synthesizer?","Everyone who knows samba knows that Padre Miguel is the shiznit. This record, though, pales in comparison to his other work,, and the abundant synthesizers sap the roots right out of this otherwise rootsy music. Sure, there is a good deal of incredible cuica playing, but I really think that finding any other of his CD's is worth the search."
3,Ghost Town - The Movie,"** It isn't a great movie. Not bad, but not great. On first viewing, it was kind of confusing at the beginning, but as I got into the story and the characters, I forgot about that. Some of the dialog could have been smoother, and more realistic, but the story itself was interesting. Most of the characters had enough depth that I was interested enough to wonder how they would end up.** I admit the only reason I bought the DVD was because Reneé O'Connor (Gabrielle in ""Xena: Warrior Princess"") was in the movie. I would have liked for her to have had a larger part, but what little she had to do was well done, even the ending, which I won't reveal for those people who hate to read the Spoilers.** Would I recommend that you buy it? Yes, if you like movies; western movies; movies that aren't your typical shoot 'em up; and if you are a fan of, and want to see more of, the infrequently seen Reneé O'Connor."
3,Ghastly Ghostly,"Dean Teaster's Ghost TownWhile I am totally stoked that my uncle did this movie, I have to give an honest review to this movie.If you like to watch the live cowboy shows like the ones that are done at Ghost Town then you will enjoy this movie, but if you don't then leave this one on the shelf. It seems as though the acting was forced and somewhat amateurish at times.As a play it would be absolutely spectacular but as a movie it is somewhat lacking.Even though there are a couple of big names in this movie it seems to have been done on a very small budget.I am truly sorry uncle (Herbert ""Cowboy"" Coward) but as much as I love you and wish you well I must give an honest opinion."
4,Movie,This movie was filmed at Ghost Town in the Sky at Maggies Valley North Carolina. Bought because I always enjoyed visiting the park.
2,GOST TOWN THE MOVIE,"I LOVE MAGGIE VALLEY BUTNOT SURE ABOUT THIS MOVIE, ITS NOT LIKE THE WESTERN ONES ...ITS CONFUSED TO START AND NOT SO ORIGINAL ACTORS....WELL HAVE TO SEE TO TRY....."
5,great movie,this is a really great movie. I don't usually like westerns but this was good. Some great special effects.
2,"Could have been good, but wasn't","The jacket says ""Lonesome Dove meets 3:10 to Yuma."" In the hands of a better screen writer, better director, better actors, and better production crew, it could have been. But it wasn't.In the hands of a better screen writer, better director, better actors, and better production crew, it could have been a great movie. But it wasn't.Great story line, poorly done."
2,TO SOFT NOT GOOD,"VICTOR IS A GREAT SONERO AND IN THE PAST HAD GOO MUSIC BUT I THINK HIS TIME IS OVER, SALSA IS SALSA NOT BALADAS."
1,Not what you think it is,"I ordered this book looking for a good fireproofing reference book that was not too long or complicated, but would educate me about current product, techniques and standard of practice. It is not that at all. This is a reproduction of a 1889 book, and nothing like what a 2007 publication date would imply. There is nothing new or useful about the book. Save your money, unless you are looking for a history lesson."
3,Malaise of being mortal,Though the story is not entirely about love. Its more about the uncertainties of life. Self induced tragedies and pessimism.
5,The Italian Bob Dylan,"Stefano Rosso's cd reminded me a lot of the Bob Dylan's songs and brought me back to the times when lyrics did actually matter in the music industry. I've heard that he might actually come to the United States for a tour and that he is playing brilliant concerts in Europe with his acustic guitar and Banjo, with a young talent, Giovanni at the keyboards. I have actually been to his concert in Rome last march and I appreciated it a lot.The cd is a potrait of the modern society sang in a very ironic mood and accopanied by brilliant music."
2,Can't really recommend this item.,"Excellent concept if you have more than one wireless computer on your system. Automatically rotates your security key code (WEP, etc) every 3 hours on all your wireless computers to make it less likely that anyone else can use your system, although not fool-proof. Slight difficulty configuring, but did recognize my wireless adapter and router. Problem is that I lost connectivity to the internet a lot more frequently using this software; so much so that I decided to remove it from my system. Once, I received an error message that ""security key rotation failed"". I use PC-cillin as my internet security/anti-virus. It may be that this program will gel more easily if you use McAfee products, but I don't know for sure."
2,Requires Specific Routers,"(...)If you don't have one of the models listed on that page, there's not much point in purchasing this software. It's capabilities without a compatible router are quite limited."
2,Don't waste your money!!!!,"I bought this product becase I was concerned about wireless security. I am familiar about the WPA security key but wanted something with a bit more punch. This wasn't it! It was hard to configure and it seems to be difficult to set up if you want to add another computer. I was also having problems adding new software to the computer. I had no choice but to remove the software from my computer,reset my router to its default settings,and go back to securing it with the WPA key. I feel is necessary to go secure in this age of id thefts and people piggybacking off your signal to get free internet. I feel that this product has come up short."
1,Questionable security,"This might be a very good product, but I can't tell from the documentation or customer support. Since its purpose is security, the lack of confidence I have in it renders it unacceptable. The product will not let me access security settings because it reports I am not connected to a ""protected network."" My network does show up as secured, so I asked what the difference between ""secured"" and ""protected"" is. McAfee customer chat support, could not answer the question. They included advertising text from their product description and forwarded it in their responses. It was the same stuff on the box the product came in. Then they said they would email additional information and call me. They did neither. It could be I don't understand the terminology, as I pointed out to McAfee, but apparently, their customer support doesn't either. Two uninformed participants make for a lousy conversation."
2,Concerns about actual level of security provided,"WiTopia.Net's SecureMyWiFi and BoxedWireless offer similar products. Although they make it completely clear they are providing the highest level of security available (WPA-Enterprise) backed up by RADIUS servers (what a corporation or Government uses to ensure top knotch wireless security), it is hard to determine what exactly McAfee is doing here but providing glorified WEP (which has been shown to be easily compromisable) with a key rotation. They do enable ""WPA"" security but it looks like it may be just the ""personal"" kind which is weaker. Useful product that solves a big and growing problem but they need to make more clear what exactly they are doing to secure your network like WiTopia.Net and BoxedWireless."
5,"Benny Isn't Just ""Into The Night"" Angel Have beautiful Songs!!!","Yes, Benny mardones Is more than ""Into The Night"" (but, Is True, Is by far the best Song of Benny). Angel Is a CD with Soft Songs, Melodic, Is Special For Romantic Nights With Your GirlFriend or Wife!Here In La Serena , CHILE, Is Common On the Local Radios The Clasic Song Of Benny, INTO THE Night, but Here, Nobody Know who's the singer with this Powerful Voice... Just This Year did konw who's Benny...Angel is a Beutiful CD, Definitively, Benny , Many Thanks For Your Music...Angel Always Will Be one of my Favorites CD On My car... By the way, Never Run, Never Hide Is a Good CD, Also!!!"
2,Two Stars,"Despite a few genuinely lovely moments, I only gave Jazz Mandolin Project two stars. Jazz at its best lays bare the soul of the instrument. This cd utterly failed to do that. List of other complaints: 1) use of an electric mandolin on some songs, 2) very little tremolo, 3) inclusion of live versions of two songs already included as studio recordings, 4) at times too noisy, 5) most of the loveliest moments almost too quiet to hear. This is my least favorite of my nine mandolin cds, and perhaps my least favorite jazz cd as well."
4,Not diswasher safe,"I love my Smoothie Jr. and recommend it to anyone who likes to make magaritas, smoothies, or frappuncinos without those big ice chunks that get stuck in your straw. One warning though. Do not put it into the dishwasher. I did with mine and the container warped, so that the lid no longer sits flush. If I try to blend now, it just makes a mess. My instruction booklet even warned me against it. I had loaned it out and wanted to make sure it was extra clean. Next one I get I will just soak in hot soapy water.I need to add that I have model SJR400B. Perhaps this model is indeed dishwasher safe...."
4,Toe-tappin' fun,"I bought this for Stefan Grapelli's contribution (I'm a fiddle player) but enjoyed even the pieces without fiddle. Just try to listen to ""Minor Swing"" without tapping your foot or waggling your bottom. The music is fun and light-hearted, and good for playing at a family gathering with varied musical tastes."
5,Don't think of Traveling without reading this first,"The author's round-the-globe travels to all continents proves educational and entertaining... Easy to read... She offers advice and 'tidbits' about how to travel & places to see off the beaten track... We learned much from her experience and observations...Highly recommend to anyone like us who loves to travel, whether to Europe, Asia, South America, Africa, Middle East or the South Pacific... Whether you travel by cruise or by land, we highly recommend this book as a must-have travel companion!Enjoy the book and your travels *****"
1,Strange book,"I'm not sure why the reviews are so good. This book is an average book - nothing great about it. There are over 100 pages on magnetic field diffusion - not sure why it is allocated so much space. On the other hand, the book barely covers magnetostatics (quite surprising for a book on magnetic fields), and the problems/examples discussed in the book are hardly useful in real life situations. Anyways, it is an OK book, but not a great book in my opinion."
4,Fast paced action,"The movie was better then I expected. It is kind of short only 70 minutes long but it is very fasted pace. The movie reminded me of a low budget movie from the 80's,I liked the scream at the beginning of the movie too."
3,Top Story of the Year: World Almanac Misses Election,"I heartily concur with the reviewer who castigated the publishers for going to press too early to include the 2002 World Series and, what is more important, the midterm election results. The latter omission makes the almanac's list of the year's biggest news stories strange indeed: surely the fact that for the first time in a half century Republicans will have full control of both Congress and the White House is noteworthy. Is the almanac's mission to record the major events of the year, or is it to beat its competitors to the newsstands and book racks? This is cynical and shoddy publishing."
4,a lot of info,"Contains a lot of (mostly) up-to-date information for the curious/bored mind. For your money, best value in Alamanacs."
2,An Old Standard Gone Bad,"There seem to be a lot more almanacs on the market than there used to be, and after reading through the World Almanac 2003 I'm understanding why. Compared to its competitors, this book is difficult to read and poorly organized. Although there are some interesting news features, the incredibly small print leaves you with eye strain when reading them. On the whole, it seems there is little effort put in to make this book different from those of the previous years. The personalities entries are especially skimpy and offer little information, and the photos are not worth a second look."
5,Do Not Miss This,"This is a wonderfully written book about one of the most interesting figures in history, Eleanor of Aquatine. From her carefree homeland to dreary England, first and second husbands, Eleanor's charactor shines through every page. I seemed to get to know her as a person, not just some charactor whom the author slaps on a few traits and leaves the ""finished product"" fuzzy around the edges. Do yourself a favor and buy this book for you, your child, you grandchild, your teacher, your... Well you get the point!!"
2,Nice Fixture,"This fixture looks fantastic and is very well built. However, the photocell does not work as well as I would like. It tends to want to stay on all the time unless it is in direct sunlight and I installed it on a covered porch. I've tried to remedy this a couple of ways but have resorted back to turning the switch off in the morning and back on again at night.If you are considering buying this fixture, please note that the lamp does not use the standard screw in base. And although replacement lamps are available, they are not the easiest item to find.Beautiful fixture, just doesn't work as well as I had hoped."
1,Problems with photo sensor,"I like the appearance of this light, but...The first one I received lasted 3 months, then stopped turning on when the photo sensor failed.The warranty replacement from Westinghouse failed in the same way in 2 months. I'm now trying to get another replacement from the manufacturer. So far, unsuccessful.In summary, good design, good price, unacceptable build quality and not even remotely worth the hassle."
2,Its just a light.,The thing stays on all day. I thought it would go on in the evening and off again in the morning.... but Noooooo. I guess I will just have to spend a little more and get one with a better photo cell. Poo.
2,Wrong Description,"Describes item with bulb not included. The bulb was included but broken. Bulb has 2 prong half twist, they cost more about $8.00 each. Description says: Customers buy this item with GE 13-Watt Energy SmartTM - 8 Pack - 60 watt replacement by DDI. These bulbs are only $1.00 each but don't fit this lamp. I returned this item because of bulb style."
3,Interesting juxtaposition of characters and their reactions,"Our bookclub read this book and really liked it. Much discussion came of the questions about who was the stronger of the two women, was the end something that might really happen, how would we have developed the characters of the men (another novel, Ms. Kelly?) and if we thought the relationship between the two friends was realistic. Great book for women to discuss. It is hard, however, to write a review without telling too many of the books secrets! We all look forward to watching Susan Kelly's career."
3,Interesting read on strained friendship between two women,"I found the potential of this book to be more interesting than the book itself! However, it was still worth the read. The two main characters -- very close friends & neighbors -- didn't seem developed enough ... although I was sympathetic to their plight, I found that I was not as moved as I should have been. I wanted to know more about them.Regardless, it was very well written. It's always fun to read about how close women can be, and this book explores (& even explains!) that nicely."
4,How Close They Did Come!,"What a wonderfully short, little, polished read How Close We Come is! This book focuses on two adult women who become true friends and depend on each other, as they go through the ups and downs of stay-at-home motherhood. As a reader, I felt the friendship grow and felt satisfaction and reassurance that female companionship is genuine and something that women, like myself & Pril, become dependant upon. I also enjoyed Kelly's perception of the way the husbands viewed the friendship between their wives Ruth & Pril.The bottom line: The story of these two women will touch your heart and remind you how valid friendships between heterosexual women are."
5,A great experience!!!!!!,"This also has ""U"" as track 2. It's a must-listen, and the version of Brain of J is awesome!! I would also like to say that I've seen them 3 times, they've been my #1 group for as long as I can remember, and this is a MUST-HAVE!!!"
3,Great Brain of J. Performance/U is a great jam,"This is not Pearl Jam's best CD single, but still very good. WISHLIST is a great song (off of Yield). U is a great jam and the highlight of the CD is the BRAIN OF J. live performance."
4,"(D)s, (R)s and (I)s will love the book","At first I was hesitant to read this book. I thought it was another visceral Bush-bashing book. It turned out to be dispassionate and as a result powerfully persuasive.I have voted for Bush twice and would do so again. (O'Neil says the same in the book.) However, I am more skeptical of him.One of the most important (and I think ignored) themes of this book is what a ""tough town"" Washington D.C. is. D.C. is a tough town because of the ideologues Suskind exposes in the book---namely Bush, but also including Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV)--and the impossibility of working cooperatively and productively with their ilk. Left-wingers appreciate this book because it legitimately attacks Bush as an ideologue. It is Americans, however, who should love this book because it exposes ideological thinking as the modus operandi in D.C.. Let dispassionate curiosity, thinking and decision making reign in D.C.!"
3,So so,"The press highlighted only a few things from the book. Generally it's not as scurrilous as promoted. It should be pointed out that O'Neill said on Jan. 13 on NBC's ""Today"" show he was guilty of using ""vivid"" language during his hundreds of hours of interviews for the book. As for his quote about the president being ""like a blind man in a room full of deaf people,"" he claimed, ""If I could take it back, I would take it back."" O'Neill said he ""probably"" would vote to re-elect Bush in November. ""I don't see anyone who is better prepared or more capable,"" he said."
3,There's more to it.,People should read Bush at War of Bob Woodward and The Threatening Storm of Kenneth Pollack. It's puts all the juicy stories and quote's of Paul O'Neill in a much better perspective.Then form an opinion.
2,Opportunism,"It is disappointing to read this book. Suskind takes advantage of a remarkably naive and suprisingly over idealistic O'Neill and is rewarded by scandal seeking readers turn book purchasers. Suskind gets is monetary reward, O'Neill subsequently recants much of what is stated in the book. There is no furry like a former Secretary of the Treasury scorned."
1,Does not live up to its expectations...,"Regardless of what political affiliation one holds, the book is overrated. All the publicity in the press might persude lots of people to buy it and then leave them looking for more. Common sense tells us not to trust any republican government (so far to my affiliation), nothing in the book suprised me. Expected more - a lot more. Very disappointing. Can't say much more about the contents, it's autobiographical, so it's basically subjective. I am going so far as to say that I am sorry I spend any amount of money on it."
2,Looking for unbiased 2-sided information? Look elsewhere.,"Like with Michael Moore's work, if you want a complete picture of a situation, you need to look elsewhere. This is sadly just another book for those who don't want to _learn_ anything, just want new facts to support their already cemented opinions.What's the point?"
3,Fantabulous!,Wow was this a great book! Every once in a while a book comes along that makes you want to shout good things out the window. This is that book!My rating system is different than most Amazon viewers. I don't give 5 stars unless it is absolutely out of this world. But this book was great.
4,Good points.,Interesting book on the various points made concerning all the events that lead upto today. People should read these types and other politic books to be able get a better view on the current events. Enjoy the book.
5,Excellent Book!!! Audio Version,"Every ""open-minded"" person should read this book!! It's one of the best! Clearly, Bush cannot lead people or make intelligent economic decisions. Since Dick Cheney has been around the White House for many years and has known Paul O'Neil for a very long time, it's obvious he's the one that's really running our country."
4,a decent companion to Bob Rubin's book,"this was a quick read, and though not as education as Bob Rubin's ""The Price Of Loyalty"" it did make a good case against supply side economics. i'm a it disappointed that Paul O'Neil didn't play a visible role in the film ""W"", but he accentuates the commonsense notion that big spending cannot be a companion of diminishing income."
3,Inside scoop on economic policy,"The value of this book for me was more the discussion of Paul O'Neills relationship with Alan Greenspan and how they discussed economic policy. There is probably more in this book of O'Neills working breakfasts with Greenspan than there is on O'Neills somewhat prefunctory meetings with the President. Also, a theme of bureacratic infighting with economics advisor Larry Lindsey runs through the book. Dick Cheney emerges as a Sphinx-like figure, sort of the Otto von Bismark or Catherine de Medici of the administration, setting agendas and orchestrating meetings. Also, good discussion of policy formulation regarding corporate governance and CEO accountability post-Enron. Alan Greenspan really shines in this passage. Nothing really too shocking here, but a good first view of the Bush administration based on accounts of an ""insider"" who really was an outsider. The book is really more than three stars, but not yet four."
4,Very thought provoking,"O'Neill and Suskind's outstanding careers lend credence to the information revealed in the book. I'm reminded of all the bizarre policy shifts (Kyoto, missile defense, Iraq) that the Bush administration has made over the past 3 years. Suskind's analysis (with O'Neill and Whitman's inside information) sound like the most plausible explanation for Bush and co's actions. It's amazing to me O'Neill lasted as long as he did. I would have QUIT long before he was asked to leave!"
2,Tedious,"Hardly worth the hype. Reluctant hero. It's so devoted to the minutiae (?) of the economic policies, no wonder Bush was bored of it. Rather overdramatizing too, for its subject areas. Uninspiring writing."
2,Interesting story badly written,"Interesting story that supports a lot of the other descriptions of policy development (or lack of it) in the Bush White House. It is a shame that in order come to grips with the real story one has to try and get over the poor construction of the text.Within individual paragraphs he changes topics without notice - sometimes even within a single sentance - most confusing !I found that the author explains the simpler economic items in detail while skirting over the more complex ones with an explaination of it being ""complex"" - why not give the reader some credit for intelect and let the reader decide if it is complex.Some observations from 9/11 are impressive - if true, which I doubt such as that as the towers were collapsing, O'Neill knew immediately that it was Al Queada - better than even the CIA, FBI could do.The book has clearly suffered from a ""rush to print"" and has not been properly and carefully edited."
1,Much Ado About Nothing,"Paul O'Neill comes off as a disgruntled, fired ex-employee with an axe to grind. He has some less than flattering things to say about President Bush, but, as I recall, when he was fired by VP Cheney in 2002, the administration had a less than flattering opinion of Mr O'Neill.You might enjoy this book if you desperately believe that President Bush was planning the invasion of Iraq prior to 9/11 attacks and other assorted black helicopter conspiracy theories cooked up about Democrats since Bush since took office.It is interesting to note that the day after O'Neill's 60 Minutes interview about this book, he clarified and/or retracted a lot of what he said.Like I said in the begining, much ado about nothing. Save your money and buy a Beatles CD."
1,I never thought of O'Niel as a fool,"Actually, just thought he was very ineffective at his job...untill I read this worthless tome. Now I know he is a fool. And still was ineffective at his job. He should thank Bush for keeping him as long as he did.Perhaps O'Niel can get a job as a janitor at the White House. He definitely has no career as a writer."
1,This book [is bad]!,"Kevin Phillips needs to give it up, reflect on his past with Tricky Dicky Nixon and remember a time when his books actually sold and didn't just have a fake high rating perpetrated by some shill who sits in front of his pc all day, writing stupid reviews and then hitting helpful on his own five star reviews and unhelpful on anybody who tells the truth about this garbage and gives it a 1 star.Phillips, you owe me a star. 1 star is too much for this garbage."
5,A real eye opener,"Before reading this book I assumed that Bush was a decent president. After 9/11 his popularity was tremendous, and I joined the majority in supporting him. Since reading this book I have become much more vigilant of his performance, and have been apalled time and time again by the devastating destruction to our country brought on by his idealistic agenda. It makes me sick. Alas, he will be re-elected to another term because the one thing he excels at is getting his way. Thanks George W. Bush, for polorizing our country, and bringing out the worst in many of us, and making America appear to the rest of the world as war mongering fanatics. I'm going to crawl under a rock, and hope the terrorists you let loose -- with your misguided expenditure of our military resources on Iraq -- don't find me."
4,O'Neill Left With His Integrity Intact,"Ron Suskind uses thousands of government documents and hundreds of interviews with administration officials as well as hours talking with Paul O'Neill in order to paint a picture of G.W.Bush and life within his presidency.Suskind provides several examples of Bush's management style, characterized as a bobble-head doll flying by the seat of his pants and proud of it. It's pretty clear that President Bush is undergoing on-the-job training during a very dangerous, volatile time, and the men who are teaching/training him are really in control. Bush's key personnel have their own agenda and it's hard to tell how much Bush truly understands. He asked Paul O'Neill to come out of retirement to ""serve the people"" and two years later is asked to resign. Thankfully, O'Neill saved himself and left with his integrity intact. I don't know if the same will be said after Bush and his Administration's term has played out."
4,It lets you be a fly on the wall,"I thought this was a great book, very easy to read and it lets one get the feeling of the workings of this White House. I can kind of understand the feeling that Bush might have felt that ONeill was disloyal because ONeill did take charge and try to make his own way despite knowing that Bush (Cheney?) wasn't in agreement. That said, I agree with his opinion that the deficit and the debt are the biggest drags on the economy and a grave danger to the future of this country. I already knew that the Iraq thing was a big smokescreen and have been angry about that for a long time. But very well written."
5,Good Book with insider information,"From this book, we see how GWB focused on Iraq but not terrorist. The evidence is in complement to another newer book ""Against all enemies"". We found a habit of GWB, attacking characters of anyone who is speaking truth about his administration. And they (including his supporters) never speak about issues exposed. see www.cppunit.org/mesg.jsp"
1,O'Niel is a very bitter man,"Paul O'Niel is obviously a very bitter man. O'Niel was unqualified for his job and justifiably removed. His comments against Pres. Bush are way off base and in watching him on tv last week, I noticed that he made a total fool out of himself and tried to lie his way out of his outrageous comments.I'm curious as to who is really behind this book.O'Niel went about this the wrong way."
2,Why?,"I truly cannot understand Mr. Paul O'Neill. Interesting how a bitter man who was fired decides to reveal his insight in a book released on an election year. It simply seems like sensationalism to me, and I truly question the validity of his claims (anyone remember what former Reagan aide Regan did?).People have jumped all over this to slam Bush because it lends a bit of credibility to their attacks. However, it isn't a very credible piece of work at all. Paul O'Neill has been backtracking like crazy and he seems to be alone in his opinions.A bitter man who didn't agree with Bush writes a book full of sensationalism and the press jumps all over it. Big surprise."
2,The Price of Loyalty:,"Another one of ""those books"" written ""about"" someone else's experience by an author trying to utilize political emotion to sucker the blind into sending him their money. No administration is perfect, but with this one I am not spending any of my time explaining what fellatio means to my 12-year-old daughter. Paul O'Neill has been very lucky and very fortunate over the course of his life. It is a pity that the old fool would sell his name to Ron Suskind because his feelings got hurt when he was fired. Now, the only thing the world will remember him for is his daily retractions of negative statements he made about the Bush administration."
2,Thrown Out of Yankee Stadium,"Several years ago during my floating phase, I was thrown out of Yankee Stadium for drunkenly shouting deserved insults at Paul O'Neill. Now I see he's making a splash with some book about being loyal to the former owner of my favorite ballclub, the Texas Rangers.I must confess, I've never been a big fan of Paul O'Neill and I like him even less now that I've read some of this silly book. A book he didn't even write (surprise), by the way. There are no witty clubhouse stories and nothing at all about girls or hotel rooms. Just some ranting and raving about loyalty and being a stand up guy and a lot of childish sobbing. Not very interesting at all. Really. HHD."
5,Devastating critique by a key insider!,"This book is a devastating critique of the Bush administration by a key inside Paul O'Neill, the former Secretary of the Treasury, who was subsequently fired for speaking his mind. And in this book, he speaks his mind again talking about the state of the federal budget, the hunt for a reason to invade Iraq (any reason will do), and the ""CEO style"" of George W. Bush - ""it was like a blind man in a meeting with deaf people."" And to think this guy is the president!Every American needs to read this book to understand what is at stake in the coming presidential election!"
3,This is not news,"Right before we attacked Iraq, Frontline did a story on what lead us to that point. They showed a letter, to then President Clinton, authored by Wolfowitz, signed by Cheney, Rumsfeld and other current Bush II inner circle, oil company types, urging the President to attach Iraq. Clinton chose the nonpre-emptive position that the United States has rightly maintained. So this is not news. What is interesting is that not even Republicans like O'Neill were aware of how obsessed these individuals were regarding Iraq."
5,Inside the White House,"Mr. O'Neill offers the following: ""The economy grew an average of 3.8 percent a year between 1996 and 2000"" and ""Productivity had risen nearly 60 percent each year since 1995."" People of average intelligence don't need former Treasury Secretary O'Neill's figures to know the Clinton economy has fallen off a cliff under the Bush administration.It's also very credible that the Bush administration is being run by greedy CEOs and a ruthless GOP party, which O'Neill points out: ""There is no precedent in any modern White House for what is going on in this one: a complete lack of policy apparatus. What you've got is everything -- and I mean everything -- being run by the political arm. Everything -- and I mean everything -- is being run by the Mayberry Machiavellis."""
5,"""Ideologues"" are running the USA","I've read many books about Bush that are available for all to read that lay bare the poor judgement followed by extremist actions of G. Bush. I wish people would read them. This is another enlightening book that glimpses inside the Bush Administration. Paul O'Neill is an extremely intelligent, down-to-earth public servant who happens to think, which is something that ""ideologues"" don't seem to find it necessary to do. This is how O'Neill described Bush: ""An ideologue"". To me, the consequences of the missed opportunities and the building of the deficit by the Bush Administration are frightening especially when he had brilliant people at his disposal 24/7. It will take a superior group of public servants to attempt to change course after this presidency is FINALLY OVER!!!! I hope and pray that there is someone of that calibur regardless of party affiliation that will do the people's business in 2008(not his own)."
4,What we've suspected all along,"This is what many of us had suspected all along. But thanks to O'Neill's candid account we have more of the insider details.Proof that Iraq was in the crosshairs since the beginning of the Bush II presidency. Proof that the government is not concerned with truth. Proof that the large campaign contributers are the ones who shape the government policies. Proof that much of what the public get to see on news is mostly play-acting. Plus more...The major characters as they appear in this book:O'Neill - the hero,Bush - our not-so-smart leaderCheney - inscutable, evil puppet masterKarl Rove - political front manIf you are a voting American you owe it to yourself to read this book. Unfortunately, I expect very few people will."
2,no validity whatsoever,"Hard to believe that there are so many gullible people out there who mindlessly jump onto any book that criticizes an administration, person, etc. Whatever happened to validifying your information, open debate on policies, and ultimate outcomes years down the road prior to jumping on the current fad of the blabocracy. There is a lot of conjecture about what is really going on, not to mention that O'Neill's popularity as well as wealth is increased immensely by this book. Too much conflict of interest and too many liberals interesting in name-calling and badgering those who are decisive and offer real opportunities for solutions, when the liberals themselves don't have any real substantive opinions or solutions. I recommend reading the book to anyone who is intellectually honest and willing to actually search for real evidence behind these claims."
1,Why Mr Suskind belongs out of Government,Mr Suskind doesn't understand how government really works . He seems to think that HE was going to make policy even if the president didn't agree with him . Perhaps he should just go and teach at a nice liberal college ( pick almost any college ) and spread his silly ideas . Who knows he could change the way the real world works to fit his foolish ideas.
2,Insider Exposes His Own Flaws,"Mr. O'Neill now wishes to distance himself from his own book. Suskind continues to say it is ""our"" book when we know he took the internal memoranda and fictionalized the situation to fit his needs to sell a book. Lawence Lindsay and others in Wall St Journal op-ed pieces have said the although Mr. O'Neill is a nice guy, he did NOT understand the vast DIFFERENCE between policy development and the ministerial functions of a department head. Mr. O'Neill has told us more about himself than the Bush Administration. He was a poor fit for the job and being fired does not sit well with big egos. I hope he enjoys more trips with Bono. They have a future together."
1,BY THE WAY .....,"According to Henry Kissenger, there was a Congressional Resolution to have a regime change in Iraq in 1998.This isn't a new concept folks....And if terrorist want to attack us again, all they need to do is read this book! Thanks to Oneil and Suskin, we have an onscene amount of classified documentation right here in plain view!!!!"
1,The White House????,"Paul O'Neill, a former CEO at Alcoa, had answers that could have helped the Country and President Bush had he bothered to listen. He says that in the Good Cop, Bad Cop, he was used by the administration as the Bad Cop so that the White House appears to be taking the High Road when on too many occations, the High Road was down and dirty."
1,DISGRUNTLED EX-EMPLOYEE,It is a good thing Mr. O'neill gets his frustrations out by using his typewriter. This seems to be the year for 'Bush Bashing' and many people seem to be getting on the band wagon. It is amazing to me that so many people actually believe everything they read or hear about President Bush.
1,This Book is Worthless.,"After reading this book, I come away with the impression that Paul O'Neill is either simply trying to get back at President Bush for rightly firing him, or he is so naive that he should never have been Secretary of the Treasury at all. I have no sympathy for him.Either way, the book provides no support for any of the many serious (yet plainly unfounded) allegations against President Bush -- it's all the word of Paul O'Neill who, obviously, has an ax to grind. This from a guy who spent the majority of his time as Secretary of the Treasury flying around the Third world with Irish singer BONO? Please. O'Neill's a joke.Alcoa's gain was the country's loss. This book isn't worth the time."
5,A Well Written Book,"There's a lot of talk about Mr. O'Neill's comments about the President's actions, or lack-there-of, in the media. If you take the time to read this book you'll find; that O'Neill is an extremely bright man, that Suskind has a real feel for how policy should be developed and you'll enjoy the style.This should be required reading for political science students.Dr. Robert S. Ardinger"
4,High School Students thoughts,"A truly insightful and interesting read.Suskind presents the story through Paul O'Neills eyes, a veteran CEO and washington cabinet member, who is mislead and ultimatly slandered by the Bush Administration. Suskind does a very good job of simply portraying the story, without the influence of personal bias. The reader is often left to draw his own conclusions from the facts presented. Even things that he isn't trying to convey. The Political jargon is sometimes difficult to get through, but is generally not a problem. A good read for anyone interested."
5,This book paves the way for treason charges...,"Of course the treason by our highest officials for lying to the American people is what I am talking about.This book gives lots of evidence. Let's see if we are a nation of hypocrits: we were outraged when one president lied about sex - are we gonna be outraged when another lies about war? Some people here talk about the politics, republicans vs.democrats in this context. It's not about politics, it's really about crime!I am disapointed that O'Neill is backtracking now on what was obvious -- that this administration was obsessed with war and theft of Iraqi oil. [Perhaps he is getting death threats!]However, the book is great, well written by an award winning WSJ journalist, with plenty of docuements. An independent investigator should have an easy task! Suskind promised to put all the evidence on the web soon."
3,"So Biased, it's hard to read","I was more interested in reading this for the historical perspective, but Suskind uses such biased language against GW Bush and others that it's no fun to read. Would have been just as good without the zingers."
5,Outstanding Book,"If you are a political junkie and enjoy political strategy and the associated gossip that accompanies politics then you will love this book. It is really an insider view of the Obama administration and how the promise of change turned into ""more of the same"". Obama campaigned on making a difference but was too incompetent and inexperienced to enact the reforms that most of the American public wanted. The hiring of Tim Geitner is shown be his greatest mistake (if Obama really was serious abut change). All the players in the White House get a mention and most don't look very good. Great book."
3,"Get a grip, people.","""People are trying to say that I said the president was planning war in Iraq early in the administration. Actually there was a continuation of work that had been going on in the Clinton administration with the notion that there needed to be a regime change in Iraq.""--Paul O'NeillJanuary 12, 2004."
1,Altec Lansing Computer Speakers,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PHW1UK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI am totally dissatisfied with this product. Whenever on it hums which becomes extremely annoying. If I had kept the box I would have returned it. I purchased this brand because it was the same brand I replaced it with.
2,Cell Phone Interference!,"These speakers cause quite a bit of interference with my cell phone. I did not have this problem with my old speakers. There is very loud interference when the phone is connecting, like during a call or just before a text message. And there is occasional interference when the phone is sitting on my desk. I could not recommend these speakers to any who plans on using a cell phone near their desk. which is pretty much everyone right?"
3,Speakers not covered by any grill or material.,"Maybe it isn't fair of me to write this review. I picked up two of these sets and planned to give them for Christmas. The speakers have no material or grill, no protection from damage. Seems that is inviting a kick to the bass unit (subwoofer) which sits on the floor, or perhaps fingers poking from grandchildren visiting. They may sound great, don't know. I took them back and purchased the Logitech X-540, instead."
1,Bad Customer Service!!,"I bought this from Office Depot 3 weeks ago. It has a bad left speaker. So, I took it back to Office Depot and they refused to return it because their return policy is 14 days. They refused to stand behind the products they sell and so I was forced to turn to the manufacturer to return it. Altec Lansing told me that I'd have to pay for the shipping to return it. The shipping would be half the price of the product it's self and would take 2 hours of my time to box it up and drive to UPS etc. So:DON'T BUY THIS OR ANY ALTEC LANSING PRODUCT.AND, DON'T SHOP AT OFFICE DEPOT."
2,"Sounds good for the price, but RF static interference is awful","I'm happy with these speakers when they're not picking up static / interference from my cell phone or laptop. The static issue is so bad that I'm going to have to give up on them. Adding RF chokes to the cables made no difference.If you'll using these speakers to listen to an iPod at a Quaker village then you'll be satisfied, otherwise keep hunting."
2,Too much buzzing,"The sound is not bad. A little weak in highs. But from the first day this speaker set would randomly buzz. Nothing to do with signal or being overdriven, just an annoying buzz that occur every couple of minutes. Either picking up radio interference as others suggest or something failing in the amplifier section.Returned for a refund."
2,Hisssss,I get a lot of hissing from my speakers. I thought it was just a bad item so I returned them for a second set. The secon set did the same thing! It seem's to me to be the speakers. No good luck here. Hiss and crackle.
3,Watch out for wireless!,"I loved this unit. Sleek, loud, great sound, and the separate control unit for volume, mic, and treble is very innovative. Unfortunately, as another reviewer stated, the control unit picks up wireless interference. It took me two units to figure this out. At first I thought it was a short in the wires, because the static changed and sometimes disappeared as I moved the control unit around. But when the 2nd unit did the exact same thing, I started shutting down devices in my office until I got to the wireless router. Bam - immediately the static stopped. Makes sense now; it explains why the static changed as I moved the control unit - it is actually picking up interference from the wireless.Unfortunately, the static and clicking is so loud I have to return this one as well.So, this gets a 4, maybe a 5 if you don't have wireless by your PC. But if you do, then it gets a 1. So I averaged the score to 3."
4,Good so far.,"Just got these speakers today, they seem to be pretty good for the price. I am a casual listener via my laptop and listen from various kinds of music ranging from U2 and Beck to T.I. and Kanye. When I first plugged them in and started listening I was a little freaked because the base was over powering U2 etc, and I quickly checked settings and realized that the treble meter had gotten switched to the lowest setting (changing it to mid fixed the problem). Also tried some music with bass and turned the bass to max, pretty good. Overall they are great for the price and I would recommend them to anyone looking for speakers in this price range. If you are willing to spend a bit more then I would go with the Logitech Z-2300 THX-Certified 200-Watt 2.1 Speaker System, which I own at my other house."
4,Great Product for Price Paid,A good complete sound. The sub really rumbles. Definitely a good value for the money spent.
4,Ok for the money,"Considering how little I spent, I suppose these speakers are ok, but I was hoping for better from Altec Lansing. I have another set of speakers on a different computer that look very similar, and that I paid similar money for, but sound better even though they're not a ""name brand""."
2,Good speaker but too much radio interference,"The speakers sound great with rich bass. However they suffer from radio interference. In my case I can hear a radio station no matter what volume I set them to. I tried them in several places in the house, same issue. Aluminum foil on the cord that connects the control to the subwoofer seems to help a little. Cellphone in vicinity drives these speakers crazy. Needless to say, my other Altec Lansing speaker pair (6 years old) work just fine."
1,Amplify cellular signal,"Looks good, sound great, but amplify cllular signals, it makes a loud scrashy sound when receiving data on blackberry or a call, is not posible use it when you whare a movil phone."
2,Cellphone interference,"Cellphones often interfere with speakers producing a very distinctive sequence of buzzing sounds. These speakers seem to amplify this intereference to ear-piercing levels. If I watch a movie I must turn my cell off completely. I can tell when my roommate two doors down is about to receive a call. Worthless.If you don't have a cellphone or live in the same neighborhood as someone who does, then these aren't bad at all for the money. Otherwise give them a pass. This isn't a matter of sound quality. The speakers are simply unusable as a result and you might be throwing your money way."
3,good and bad,"The sound quality is great, but I get a lot of humming from my cordless phone. This was never an issue with other speakers I've used."
2,What a joke,"I liked the idea of the volume thing being on the desk and not mounted on the speaker. The speakers sit a ways away and I thought this was a great idea. BUT... when my computer is booting up these speakers give horrible feedback. Even with volume all the way down. The sound is hollow and the bass is extremely boomy and over powering. Sub volume down to minimum its still very over done.These are junk. I wish I had just stuck with the speakers built into the monitor. They were crappy too, but they were also working and did not cost me any extra money.I do NOT recommend these at all."
2,Not Bad,"This is the compilation that was being talked about in the HC scene for years. It's an history of NYHC (88 era). All great band but except for one - Youth Defense League, a skinhead pro-america nazist bands and that's the bad part of this compilation."
3,A little dissapointed,"They're are some good hardcore bands on here like Gorilla Biscuits , Sick Of It All , Youth Of Today , but the songs they have choosen aren't really each bands best. I thought it was cool to hear the bands in their earlier periods though. But this is the last time I buy a comp CD."
5,No Problem with ME,"We just bought the ScanJet 3400c. It is our first scanner & we love it. We also have Windows ME & have had no problems. HP has made it so easy to scan, print & e-mail projects with just a touch of a button. Our kids have had a blast doing their school projects with this scanner. It is a must for every family & small business owner."
3,Belt problems,"I was pleased with this scanner until I scanned my third or fourth document. (Unfortunately, this occurred after the 90-day warranty expired.) While scanning the document, I heard a rattling noise, and the scanner stopped scanning. I looked under my document and through the scanner glass I saw a small white plastic cap rolling around loose. The belt that pulls the scanner back & forth had come off its upper axle because this cap, which should stay on the end of the upper axle, had popped off. (Note to HP: The cap ought to be threaded, like a screw, or glued on, so that it does not pop off.) I tried to email hp.com to ask for help in opening the scanner and fixing this on my own, but my computer keeps getting an error message from their website emailer."
1,Never buy an HP scanner,I bought a ScanJet 3400C at the beginning of July. It worked fine until just after the 90 day warranty expired. Now I can't get the lamp to work and I either have to pay to have it repaired or pay HP... to return it for a new one. I only paid $... for it to begin with! Now I am saving my little pennies for a Cannon or an Epson. The HP is going into the trash.
2,Will work with ME; just pull the plug!!!,"I too have had problems getting the scanner to initialize in Windows ME. I would click on the scan button or start the scan tool from the Start menu and the scan tool would hang up. I found that if I pull the plug from the back of the scanner and then plug it back in, it will work every time! My solution must be used when Windows ME is running. Too bad this scanner doesn't have a power switch.Aside from this ridiculous problem, this scanner is great when it comes to speed and quality. You can scan a photo at 1200 dpi in less than 30 seconds on a 1000 MHz machine."
1,"Good Word List, Bad Pronounciation","The selection of words is good but the pronounciation is all wrong. This should be Modern Standard Arabic -- and the words are MSA but the pronounciation is distractingly gulf dialect: Hard ""Q"" is pronounced as a G; the hard ""D"" is pronounced as a hard ""th"" (as in /th/ose); and the 3in's are annoyingly drawn out.For someone looking how to speak proper MSA, this is not the product for you. For an advanced student, you can figure out the proper letters they're saying by referring to the included vocabularly list."
3,Great old school HC! Just wish it would last longer,"This is a classic sXe hardcore album. Gorilla Biscuits have the true HC attitude and the lyrics on this album reflect that. ""Hold Your Ground"" has helped me get through some tough times in high school. The song is about staying true to yourself even when people won't accept you because they can't understand difference. All of the songs basically have the same structure, but they are very enjoyable because they're aggressive and also very catchy. The only thing I really wish I could change about it is the length. This classic album ends way too soon! With that aside, I would still definitely recommend this album for some great old school hardcore from one of the best bands of the time."
3,a taste of things to come,The EP that followed the best hardcore album to this day. It's got some really good songs on it as well as a few that don't do to much for me. It's very obvious that these songs are written by someone that will go on to do better things.
4,Finally something I can enjoy!,"Since my two favorite Car magazines died (Sport Compact Car Magazine and Turbo magazine)...I turned to my other passion, home theater. This magazine fits the bill and is for everybody (every budget too) out there that wants some info on new products, Blu-rays, Home Theater set-up and nice articles on Uber Home Theaters. I highly recommend this mag for any Home Theater enthusiast."
4,excellent magazine,"Great magazine for those into home electronics,big screen tv, and surround sound systems."
5,Kant's Psychology,"Kant's Anthropology is what we call today - psychology. The book is a series of lectures that Kant himself edited into a book. Usualy we know Kant as hard to read, yet this book is unique in that. It flows, from subject to subject, examining man's mind and various characteristics of the human spirit. It is embodied with examples from life and literature, and gives a very good idea of Kants views regarding everyday life and behavior of normal people, and also of insane ones. It is a very warm book, filled with intelligent remarks about the human race, and it gives a very good notion of psychology (both cognitive and abnormal) in Kants days. I recommend it Highly."
2,Covered the events in 1775 but disappointing in authenticity,"This video concerns itself with the situation in and around Boston in 1775. The British occupation and siege of Boston, subsequent campaigns to Lexington and Concord, and the Battle of Bunker Hill are all covered. The film's commentary and content are factually based. Overall, this video is a good synposis of the topic for the novice historian.I was expecting a more in depth coverage of the battle and was disappointed by the ahistorical uniforms and battle reenactments. The British reenactors were incorrectly uniformed in the 7 Years War / French and Indian War era. Also, indians were depicted fighting in the battle and historically there were none present."
2,Miles,"I was expecting something more like a book, or book format. Instead, this is a college format book, probably straight out of your local community college, so although its practically free, pass it up. Instead, buy something else from this seller. Shipped quick and sellers seemed reputable."
3,Good choice/Poor shipment,"The computer security screen was just what we were looking for. Great timing and the lowest price we could find, but the shipment of the screen was not secure enough. We had to return because the glass screen was broken during shipping."
3,Okay product,"This product worked pretty well. Some of the dishes did not set up well, even though I accurately measured the water to mix with the agar. It stayed runny, even after refrigerating it. Not bad for the price, though."
3,Not a bad product,I received this right on time. Unfortunately one of them cracked. So they are very fragile. I would recommend them but be very careful.
5,Excel 2000 VBA Programming book,"Hi,I received the Learn Microsoft Excel 2000 VBA Programming book and it was in very good condition and included the learning CD.I would approve this vendor."
2,UNFINISHED,"The title of this set is catchy. However, the pattern seems to be lacking, or rather incomplete, perhaps as though just thrown together. Not for someone with taste I'm afraid."
4,Salmon Skin Roll,"We have used other Snack 21 items for years, but wanted to try the skin roll. Our dog is small, but he ate the roll up in two sessions. Thinking back, I should have cut it down for him."
3,Frat Garage Rock,"I liked the Monks. Heavy drum sound. Imagine German fraulines dancing to the groves and having no idea the lyrics are at times political and other times raunchy but delivered in a tongue and cheek way. Unique, not only for its time but for all time. Frat garage rock, American serviceman in Germany, party hard and being weird. Cannot really say anything bad about it, they did what they wanted to. Five stars goes to certain Beatle albums, so don't let me 3 stars scare you."
4,interesting!!!!!,this C.D i enjoyed and enjoy to listen to but the episodes enhance the songs so much that I would prefer the videos
5,Just about sums it up...,"This album just about sums up the entire series. The songs have been chosen carefully to reflect the different moods Ally and other characters are in. For example, could 'You Belong To Me' be an indication of Ally wanting Billy?The music is excellent, and Vonda Shepard brings it alive with a stunning voice. I don't usually listen to this sort of music, but this is a real change. It soothes your mind, and you will never get bored."
3,Good - but better on TV,"While this is not a bad album, far from it, it is still a bit disappointing. When you've heard the songs on the hit TV-show, the versions on this CD just sound a little bland. The CD does have it's really strong moments though, and the songs ""Hooked On A Feeling"" and ""You Belong To Me"" are definitely some of those moments. If I could give the CD 3 1/2 stars I would, but as it is 4 stars would be too much."
4,Need a second and third album !,"Please tell me Vonda Shepherd has more Ally McBeal CDs.Specifically, I am looking for ""Baby Don't You Break My Heart Slow"" and ""I know Him by Heart""........PLEASE !"
2,hm.....,"i love the show. after listening to this album i realized that i love ally - NOT VONDA. the former is the saving grace of the latter. take ally out of it and ... what are you left with?not a whole lot of emotional subtlety and finesse here. perhaps one of the reasons ally appears so fragile and on the edge is the unrelenting assault of vonda shepard's voice.as far as i'm concerned, vonda sans ally doesn't quite cut it..."
5,"Great songs, not only for fans","Any die-hard fan of Ally McBeal should own this CD: it will remind you some significative scenes and episodes inthe series. But also anyone who likes good music will enjoy this CD, which is a mix of remixed ""oldies"" and pop music, interpreted by great Vonda Shepard. Great at any time, driving in the car, at home alone or with friends, because it has beat but also great lyrics that will make you think if you listen carefully... definitely a must have!"
1,I was hoping for the best,"What I got was a random selection of very average pieces....too bad, because there is some terrific music on the show!"
3,Good vocalist ... terrible artist,"Vonda Sheppard is a decent singer, and I thought she was an exceptional artist when I heard her in the episodes of Ally McBeal. Now I know better. I seem to have been distracted during the shows. Also, the show producers only play the good snippets of Vonda's songs.The bad parts of Vonda's songs tend to be her flourishes, where she attempt to be Mariah Carey. Vonda ... I know Mariah Carey ... You're no Mariah Carey.In between flinching at Vonda's flourishes and fast forwarding through what I can only suspect are her ""original"" work, there are a few good songs which I find myself humming during the day. Those few songs are why I would not return the CD or throw it out. Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh. How many CDs have ALL good songs ? However, what makes me bad-mouth this CD are the really terrible songs and flourishes which make my skin crawl."
3,Vonda should stick to the old classics,"My best friend bought this CD because he loves the theme song from Ally McBeal. Unfortunately for him, that's the only song he does like on the album. Unfortunately for me (since we're usually together), I enjoy listening to all the old tunes EXCEPT for the theme song and the songs written by Vonda Shepard. I especially love You Belong To Me. What a beautiful song beautifully done, but many of the tracks are disappointing."
5,Track after Track of great music,"All the songs on the soundtrack are great, especially Vonda Shepard's original songs. ""Searchin My Soul"" is catchy and uplifting, while ""Maryland"" is a subtle and inspirational ballad. Her covers of other songs are great too. ""It's in his Kiss"" is fun and fast, while ""Walk Away Renee"" and ""Neighborhood"" are slower but very sweet. Patsy Cline's, ""You Belong to Me"" is sentimal and sung very well. Vonda Shepard has a strong voice backed up by a good band! Even if you haven't seen the show, you should be able to appreciate the great music!"
2,"Boring Covers but The Few Originals Merit 2 Stars!,","From the point of view that this album does indeed contain the tracks that come from the Ally McBeal TV series, this album doesn't disappoint, however, from the point of view that the covers are very inferior renditions of the original, this album makes for very boring listening indeed. If you are going to cover somebody else's work, you should either do it very differently or a lot better than the original. Vonda does neither here but to her credit, the first track which is an original, ""Searchin' My Soul"" is the best track on the album and is the sole redeeming factor overall. Get this only if you want a souvenir or a memento of what you liked about the tv series but not if you are looking for a great music album."
5,Excellent music!!,"I bought this Cd after watching the tv series. What I like best are the ""remakes"" of popular old songs such as ""Hooked On a Feeling"", or ""It's In His Kiss"". The songs written by Vonda Shepard are also very enjoyable, there is always a kind message in each of her songs if you listen to the words carefully. If you like the tv series you'll love this CD!!"
5,ALIVE AND ENERGETIC,"This is a sing-along album. Most of the songs on the album are about 20years old but listening to Vonda's renditions is like a new experience. Her voice is strong and clear. She carries a tune real well and is not crowded out by instrumentation. The songs are so episode related that I actually envision the scenes where they were applied. I bought my album in July and have been listening to it every weekend. I have recommended it to a number of friends at work and they too are enjoying it. Now, if I could only find a T-Shirt with the Dancing Babies!!"
4,i think its great,"This cd is one that gets you bopping along to songs you know well, as well as ones you dont but might be familiar with. This cd is great for all you ally mcbeal fans out there."
3,"If you like great oldies songs, you'll like this CD!",This is a great CD for all people even if you don't watch ally Mcbeal
2,Too many re-makes of old songs.,"Although Vonda Shepard has a lovely voice and is a talented song writer, this album contains, too many remakes, of songs that aren't hers. I was disappointed as I was hoping to hear more of her own, brilliant tracks, as featured on Ally McBeal. The initial, 3 albums (on, a different record label) are much better."
2,Can you say Michael Bolton?,"Sorry, but it is time for someone to utter a discouraging word. The only value to this album comes from reminding us of what was, and sending us back to the old vinyl. Sometimes, immitation indeed is the sincerest form of flattery. Other times, it just should not be done. Like here.These songs were better the first time around. ""Walk Away Renee"", ""Ask The Lonely"", and most of the others recorded here just don't hold a candle to the originals. And only in the interest of historical accuracy, to gently correct another reviewer, ""It's In His Kiss"" was recorded by Betty Everett fifteen years before Cher did (you could look it up!)Like Manilow singing Sinatra, of the aforementioned Bolton singing Percy Sledge, some things should just not be done."
1,Very weak soundtrack!!,This is a bad soundtrack. I want my money back!! The cover version of Hooked On A Feeling is terrible. It's dreadful. Don't waste your time and money on this one.
4,Love it and hate it,"Overall, I love Vonda's interpretations of so many old songs. This is a great compilation. HOWEVER, cutting off Just Walk Away Renee is PURE SACRILEGE. What the heck were the producers thinking? Freakin' idiots!"
5,I LOVE IT!,IT'S FANTASTIC. NOSTALGIC SONGS FOR MY GROWING UP PERIOD; GREAT VOICE AND RENDITIONS OF THE SONGS. HOPE SHE DOES MORE LIKE THIS ALBUM.
4,"Fun, and moving","I found the cd was great to have in the car since it contains mant old songs and a couple of new ones. I think it's neat how theres a lot of music on the show and it goes how the characters are feeling. If you buy this cd, you should be pleased."
3,the quelty of the songs on the internet are badits a nice cd,"the songs are a bit kitch. but it is a nice album. i'd like to say that the series ""ally mcbeal"" is wonderful!my whole family watch it.at israel last thursday was the FIRST appesode."
5,An excellent album even if you don't watch the show,"I saw the video for ""Searchin' My Soul"" and loved it, so I bought this album without hearing any other songs. I never thought I could actually listen to some of the older songs, like ""Hooked On A Feeling,"" or ""Tell Him,"" but I love the way Vonda Shepard sings the songs. The older songs don't sound like ""oldies."" My favorite songs, in addition to the ones I just mentioned, are ""The End of the World,"" and ""Maryland."" You don't even have to like the TV show to enjoy this album. I want to know what else Vonda Shepard has coming for us!!"
2,"vonda butchers great classics,and her own stuff too","I'm sorry to be rude, and I don't mean to, but what has to be said, has to be said.Vonda belongs in a bar.She is an awful singer, and an average songwriter.I have no idea why in the world they chose this bad singer when there are all these great voices in this world.I really enjoy the songs on here, as they're sweet, relaxing, and bring a feeling of warmth and security, but vonda absolutely destroys them with her gawd-awful voice."
1,Make it stop! Make it stop!,"Contained on this CD are 14 convincing arguments against the capitalist system. If you want to include the cover art, make that 15. Total dreck. Ms. Shepard ought to get a job working for the local meat market. If she can butcher a side of beef as thoroughly as she butchers these songs, she'll be Employee of the Month in no time."
1,No talent to be found! Yawn.,I just saw V. Shepard in concert with the Indigo Girls and I am convinced she belongs in a holiday Inn bar collecting tips! Very average singer/songwriter. She better kiss the producers of Alley Mcbeals feet for the coverage she gets. She is horrible. No amount of beer could make me tolerate her mediocrity. One star for the album cover with Lockhart.
4,"Tough material, but beware the fluff inside","I have an English Bulldog puppy who loves to chew. I was told Jute was the most durable material, which it lasted awhile with her. Unfortunately, within a week, she ripped th head off the bear and was getting into the fluff. I removed all the fluff and gave the bear to my puppy. She still seems to enjoy it alot. Overall, I recommend it."
4,A nice story told in a lovely way.,"Well, after I read the plot I decided to have a look at it, I am fond of bunnies so it's been a thing worth to try.I found the story really nice and well told, musics are really nice, titles and menus are ok and the graphic quality and animation is quite good for this kind of product.I found all ""well balanced"", characters are all ok and ""no more than needed no less"" and I am sure every children will find them lovely.The story contains an important moral teaching and all is explained and show in a fluent smooth way so no excess soppyness no excess of morality.I like it, it's really one of those things I can watch more than once any time I wish a bit of relax."
5,Great gift item,This is a beautiful pen for ones ownself or giving as a gift. Specially because it is not thin like the other Cross pens; its grip and feel is perfect. Makes a very good gift item.
4,nice pen,This pen looks elegant and came in a solid box. I had it engraved and it turned out well. It tends to get marks from fingerprints easily.
4,You Get What You Pay For!,"I bought this corner stand because I needed a cheap television stand for an old 36"" tube television I keep around for Retro-Gaming. The build of the stand feels and looks super cheap, some of the pieces are held together by plastic connectors.The stand is super easy to assemble, I had it up and finished in less than 30 minutes. Once in place with the television it actually looks pretty nice in the room, but I still worry about the build quality as the television sitting on the stand is pretty heavy and larger than the stand is intended to hold. As long as it doesn't crumble under the weight of the television sitting on top of it, I will be very happy with this purchase.-PROSLow priceVery easy to assembleClean looking finished product.-CONSCheap lookingSeemingly low quality"
1,What I received is not at all what is pictured,"The cuff links I received do not look like what is pictured. I can understand a slight difference I guess but the cuff links I received does not have any black, brown and is a different design then what is pictured. The only similarity is the shape of e link and that the one I received has blue in it.I would return the cuff links but I don't want to eat the shipping for both ways."
5,Photo Album/Essays,"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of bluegrass music. Carl Fleischhauer's photographs are worth the cost of the book alone. He has stunning black and white photos of early concerts featuring some of the greatest bluegrass musicians to grace the stage. He also has terrific backstage shots, photos of parking lot pickings, and nostalgic images, such as Uncle Pen's fiddle. These photos portray fascinating facets of bluegrass music's history. Neil Rosenberg's writing complements and enhances these images. His writing provides sufficient information to answer significant questions raised in looking at Fleischhauer's photographs. As a special treat, the book includes a fine photo memorial and essay to Bill Monroe. This book is an excellent record of the early history of bluegrass, and it vividly portrays images that ring true today."
5,A moment-by-moment invasion experience,"Canadian report Paul William Roberts spent three decades covering the Middle East and was one of the few journalist6 to have interviewed Saddam Husseun, so he knows Iraq better than those newly there - and he was in Baghdad when the bombs fell. A WAR AGAINST TRUTH: AN INTIMATE ACCOUNT OF THE INVASION OF IRAQ is thus much more than an outsider's report: it's a detailed first-person moment-by- moment account of politics, personalities and history by one who has spent most of his adult life learning and absorbing. An excellent non-American, non-Middle-East perspective is developed."
1,speedo,"odometer works but, speedometer part doesn't cheap quality poorly made.will not purchase products from this manufacturer again."
1,Do not buy these guages,"I bought these gauges to put in my 71 Chevelle, i get done installing them and for some reason one of the gauges is lit with an LED and the rest are lit with a bulb. I bought every gauge(oil pressure, engine temp, tach, speedo, fuel level, battery) and the LED obviously stuck out like a sore thumb. I called Equus and their response word for word was, ""oh, engineering must have dropped the ball"" i am not kidding. Unbelievable. I would highly recommend not ever buying guages from a company like that."
1,junk,"oil pressure guage pegged out when I knew I only had 50 lbs pressure, and the water temp didnt move until the engine was at the overheating temp.then it also pegged out."
4,Last Light,"I truly enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end.It was a wonderful well written ""what if"" type of reading!"
2,Interesting Idea but,"the follow through not so much. It is a Christian book which I don't mind because I got it as a freebie and most of the freebies are Christian fiction and I like them well enough. This one to me kind of drags and while the murder mystery is interesting you pretty much figure out who done it early on. The daughter got on my nerves with her incessant whining as did the other children in the main family and that also kind of guided my view of it. It is like everything that is ugly about humanity was highlighted in this book, including not caring about your fellow man, reverting to sterotypes, and self entitlement which I know is apart of human nature but not something I want constantly brought to my attention when I'm reading ""fiction"" to escape. I had to read another book in the middle just to cut the depression in half. All in all not too bad but I probably won't keep it on my Kindle and won't buy the rest of the series if I ever want to finish it (a library maybe)."
3,This is a Christian book,"I am a Christian, however I do not feel I need to be preached to while reading fiction. This book is actually pretty good until you get halfway through and the Bible quotes and discussions begin. If that doesn't bother you, then read the series. If this kind of thing bothers you as it does me, don't bother."
5,Great read,This really made me wonder how I would react if I were in the situation these characters were in. And it could certainly be a reality in the future. It made me appreciate all the things we take for granted. I can't wait to read the rest of the series. Ms. Blackstock certainly knows hoe to grab your attention and keep you immersed in the story
3,Not that good...,"The concept of this story drew me to this book.I agree with a previous reviewer that the heroine is extremely annoying, as are all the characters. I understand that the author wanted to portray the way people would react to such as disaster, however, I feel that if you are interested in this subject, you will have a hard time identifying with the main characters, and that was really the biggest disappointment for me. I wanted to care bout the family, but they are always whining and making bad choices, and praying. Sensible main characters, even prepared for disaster main characters, would have made a much better book.If you are not interested in survival preparedness, this book may be an okay read for you, but if you are, get ready for a lot of annoying dialogue, and very little fictional substance on the topic at hand.If you want a better read on this subject, try ""Lights Out"" by Hallfast, much, much better written and exactly the same scenario."
2,"Christian good, everyone else bad","The premise of the story is interesting. All the power is gone and the community must learn how to cope and thrive learning about strength's they didn't know they had. Be prepared to be saved, women will learn to obey and of course all the characters that are bad are not Christians. The ""roll your eyes"" moments are many. After reading this and considering this really is the way religious people think, that frightened me more than the story. Oh and there is a difference between religion and Christianity. Only christianity is right, everyone else's wrong. I'm glad this was a library book."
5,A terrific read lots of suspense,"I gotta say, Terri Blackstock is quickly becoming my favorite author with each new book that I read. I have read quite a few, and this one is excellent. I couldn't put it down, stayed up late to finish, if you like suspense, you will like this. Also, its great for giving you pause for thought about your own spirituality. As a christian, I am finding the christian suspense genre to be a wonderful reading category on dual layers. Get the book, it will be worth it."
3,Good premise - could have used a better mystery.,"Ok, I admit it. I listened to the unabridged version of this on CD.While the murder mystery storyline was rather contrived and honestly not helpful to the larger story, I did find the premise of this book captivating.Having lived through a major hurricane I know first-hand what it is like to live in a city that is suddenly cut-off from the world. Blackstock does a great job of honestly portraying how people act under such circumstances.One thing I took away from Last Light was the picture of humanity it gave. In such times as depicted in the book, some prove themselves to be heroes and others to be worthless and even evil. But most of us are just average people trying to cope with extraordinary circumstances. It is on that level that this book succeeds. How do orindary people react to extraordinary times?"
2,Last Light,"This book seemed to drag on & on & on, the ending was alright but it took forever to get there"
2,Sick of series,"What is it with Christian writers and Series? I am so tired of reading a book, only to come to the end and realize that if I want to know the conclusion, I have to buy more books. Some are more stand alone than others, but Last Light really left one feeling they were left off in the middle."
1,"Waste of time, money, energy, and space","This was my first experience with Terri Blackstock and it will be my last. I'm not sure why this author is rated so highly. I couldn't get through the first five chapters. I actually deleted it from my Kindle archives because in addition to my wasted time--it was also wasting space!Extremely poor writing, middle-school dialog, totally unlikeable characters, implausible storyline, simplistic view of Christianity and faith in times of trial.........I won't waste another dime on Blackstock."
1,Disappointing,"Very pedestrian writing. A child could predict every plot step. I also agree with another reviewer that the blurb should say that it is intended as a religious lesson. That way, people who like such books can find it and those who prefer not to be force-fed someone else's beliefs can stay away."
1,"sexist, git yer guns 'n protect them women, sermonizing","I started reading this book for it's sci-fi/thriller concept. It really is based on an interesting premise. But it took me no time at all to tire of the whining children. Then it became clear that the only smart people in the family were male, and they were going to have protect the really shallow women.I don't have a big problem with Christian literature. Some of it can be uplifting - I loved the Mitford series and it helped me through the toughest part of my life to date. But when weighed down with a heavy molasses of preaching and making sure ""women know their place"" it does nothing to raise my consciousness of the divine.I am SO sorry I spent any time or money acquiring this book."
2,Not my favourite,Some books are so good you must have them in your bookshelf.This is not one of them.Glad I didn't pay much for it at all...
5,One of my FAVORITE series!!,"Loved this series. To be honest, I didn't think I would like this series about Earth losing power, I thought this was a little far out. I decided to read it anyway and could not put the books down, my favorite series of Terri Blackstock. Way to go Terri!!"
2,had more potential,Kept turning pages thinking story would come together . Just seem to leave too many items that did not make sense. Maybe book was not for me but storyline did appeal to my liking.
2,If you're looking for a poorly written unfinished sermon...,"... then you might like this book.The premise is initially interesting enough, but the plot then quickly degenerates into what is is basically a simple murder mystery. It reads easily enough (the only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1), but otherwise neither the character development nor dialogue are especially realistic.It should be advertised as more of a ""Christian"" book than what it is, as the reader is in for plenty of proselytizing.I'm glad it was free on Kindle, otherwise I would have wasted not only my time but also my money."
3,Kill me now if I ever have kids like that!,"The book and writing were decent. I'm a big fan of this genre and thought the perspective on this one was interesting. But those kids! Especially, the oldest daugher! I couldn't get into their characters because they were just horrible kids and so self-centered. It was frustrating to me, because it took away from the interesting storyline, to listen to those kids constantly complain and make selfish, stupid decisions. I realize that some people may have kids that may act like that in this type of situation, but all of the kids? I was wishing the storyline was from another family's perspective. Other than the kids, I liked the other characters."
2,Last Light,"I guess I should have read these reviews before I bought this book. I really enjoyed the book UNTIL she got into the religious Christian preaching. I am not Christian and really don't like it pushed down my throat. I read for entertainment and relaxation. This book would have been great and gotten a 5 star if she had kept religious beliefs out of it. The story line was good and something that people could relate to in this crazy world and it could have really worked just as well, if not better if it she kept the Christian preachings generic referring to god instead of Jesus. I guess this will be the first AND last Terri Blackstock book I read. Perhaps the description should have said more about the religious aspect of her books."
4,"Overall, good","The premise of the novel allows for some interesting consideration of the priorities we have in life. God, in an instant, causes everything that depends on power and micro-chips to fail. Without cars, electricity, or any modern appliances, people are far worse off than 120 years ago because they don't have the tools, knowledge, or experience to live off the land. It brings out the worst traits of most people, and eventually, the best in some.Overall, I liked the novel. I did find the individual traits of most of the characters to be too exagerated, which made the challenges and situations they would face a little predictable."
5,excellent,"Terri Blackstock really captures the essence of human nature while creating a superb suspense story. She makes you think about your relationship with God and how you would react in the event of a unexplained disaster. Absolutely page turning, don't stop reading until the end book."
5,Riveting,"The concept of this storyline is fascinating and made me realize just how complacent we have become in the world due to our modern conveniences. The characters are well-written and believable, and you can really fall into the story as if you are there. I find this to be the case often with this author's books. I really appreciate a novel that can bring tears to my eyes due to the realism of the characters.I also appreciated the Biblical concepts and the way she applied them within the story. When challenged by hardships beyond our comprehension, how would we handle passages like James 1:2-8 or Matthew 5 & 6?Recommended if you like adventure/suspense/mystery novels. I just ordered book 2 in this series."
2,Far too Condescending and Lecturing,"I love a good post-apocalyptic story, but this one is just too clearly hiding another agenda. It's as if the book was written by a parent who's trying to disguise the lectures to their children in the form of a story. Defy your parents: pay the price. There was just too much thinly veiled ""moralizing"" and ""lecturing"" for me, and I found it very distracting."
3,Great beginning...,"I'll start with the good - very interesting premise and great character development. Unfortunately, the sermonizing/judgmental tone of the book became grating...especially toward the end. I knew it was a Christian book going in and I am a Christian but I think more could have been accomplished with more story - less sermon. But not a bad read."
2,too religious for my taste...,"I did not know this was going to be a ""religious"" book. Between that and the whiny, narcissistic older daughter, I had to stop reading it."
4,unanswered questions,"This book was well written. The concept is certainly scary. Given the fact that we are so dependant on everything in our lives that require electricity, having an unknown problem make all we use everyday unusable it makes you think what would I do? I did enjoy the book but I was unhappy with the ending. What was the cause of ""the outage""? does Denni's finance ever come for her? does she get involved with the son of the killer? I wnated these questions answered but guess that won't happen. oh well i can't complain given the price :)"
5,Excellent Plot,Truly inspiring fiction. It really makes you think about how spoiled we are with all our conveniences and how grateful we should be for all that we have.
1,Simplistic and uneducated story,"Don't expect anything on the order of believable science fiction. The ""christian"" thing was even lame. I found it pretty non-credible that everyone would turn into violent, self preserving animals in a matter of hours, as the book makes it appear. Unlike Kim Stanley Robinson's trilogy on global warming, there was no science in this book and the human characters were shallow, stupid, and unlikeable."
5,Great Western!,"I gave this movie as a Christmas present and the recipient was very pleased! These old B western movies are really entertaining. It has a lot of action as well as famous B western stars. If you have a relative or friend who grew up in the 1940's and likes westerns, this would be a great gift for them..."
5,The definitive sight reading book for bass,"When I decided to learn the violin years ago, I knew I needed to be able to sight read first before finding a teacher. I was somewhat intimidated by learning how to sight read. I viewed it as essentially learning a new language. But the essential elements books made it ridiculously easy to do so. So I knew when I decided to learn bass, EE was the way to go. Essential elements really kinda ""spoon-feeds"" it to you every step of the way. The book shows you exact finger placement that corresponds to the note to be played, and really buries it into your brain in a gradual, integral way. Essential elements is the absolute last word in learning to sight read."
1,BUYER BEWARE!! Special adapter needed for $30,"The Amazon site states that this headset will plug into any phone modular port, however what they don't tell you is that YOU MUST PURCHASE a special ""Quick Disconnect"" Plantronics adapter. THE ADAPTER IS NOT INCLUDED. It looks like it will cost $30 (on top of your $89.99 headset purchase) and plan on spending about an hour to figure out the part number from the Plantronics website (the part number in the product literature is incorrect). I give up. I'm sending it back."
3,Some Of The Classics,"""Nocturne"" is somthing of a collection of famous and not so famous classical favorites reproduced in DVD-Audio format - STEREO; not multicahnnel! These include Faure, Liszt, Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, Massenet, Mussorgsky, Debussy, Grieg, Ravel, Satie, Stravinsky, Rodrigo, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, & Schubert. The sound is exceptional and the pieces range from solo sets to orchestral masterpieces. This 'extended DVD video' is unusual in that there is an interactive video display on your television with numerous options. It is also rare in that the compressed encoding allows over three hours of music to be enjoyed in this set. One drawback (and this is major); the sound is in stereo and not multi-channel, a strong reason for buying DVD-Audio."
3,Need muscles to push this stroller,"I have used this stroller for about six months now and am already looking to purchase a different double stroller. It does fold easily, even with one hand and folds flat. Unfortunately, it takes so much energy to push it I never want to take the kids anywhere in it. I thought maybe it was just me, but my husband used it last weekend and thought the same thing."
3,not for a sleepy toddler. . .,"I like the lightweight, easy fold feel of this stroller. The price is great too. That said, we have had 2 major problems with it.My son (3) still gets sleepy from the motion of riding in back and has no place to rest. He will fall asleep sitting up, then winds up hitting his head on the back side rails as he falls over. It's dangerous and I can't use the stroller anytime he might be sleepy. No naps in this one.My second issue is that it is not stable side to side on a slanted surface. If the sidewalk is graded or uneven it takes my whole strength and bodyweight to keep the stroller from tipping. This might not be an issue if your outings are mostly to the mall/shopping centers, but we live downtown and I feel like I'm wrestling with this stroller a lot. I would never be able to let my mother in law use it-- she's not as strong as I am. The small size comes at a price.I'm shopping for a new stroller now and thought this info might be useful to others."
3,Good stroller for a newborn and toddler,"My oldest son is 3 1/2 and no longer wants to sit in a stroller. He loves the option to sit or stand up. It works well with an infant seat. The cup holder is a nice plus. It is hard to manuver and while the storage basket is large, the opening is small (between the bench and front seat) and inconvenient. Overall, it's a good beginning stroller, but I'm already looking for something else for when my baby can sit up."
1,"Too Heavy, Too Big and Too Bulky","This stroller is way to heavy, too long, steering is very difficult and too bulky, it is huge when folded. Try something else."
4,"Not as good as ""Songs in the Key of Springfield"", but good","If you are a big Simpsons fan and already have the first of the two Simpsons CD's, this one isn't as good as the first. It contains the new songs and some of the old ones left off the first CD. But personally, I like the old episodes better and thought the first CD was better. The best tracks on this CD are ""Trash of the Titans"", ""Happy Birthday Mr. Burns"", and ""Canyonero""."
5,Go Simpsonic Original Music,Bought for my son. He had trouble finding it and was very pleased with the price. He rated it a five.
2,Procrastinator's Guide Review,"This book has many good ideas but it is not well organized for procrastinator's. The content deals more with how to be successful at work than dealing with procrastination. Even then, there is a lack of cohesiveness. Author has good ideas but lacks a central point of view.Really doesn't tackle deep issues surrounding procrastination at work. Serves as a pep talk for dealing with different work problems.Found other books more effective and better organized."
1,A waste of time,"If you are a true procrastinator, don't waste your time by reading this book. While the author has good suggestions for those who have trouble making decisions, she fails miserably at helping those who know what to do and simply can't take action. If suggestions such as ""start sooner"" is what you're looking for, then this is the book for you. If you'd be motivated by calling yourself a ""smart little snuffle-bunny,"" as the author suggests, then this is the book for you! However, if you are over the age of 10 and don't appreciate being patronized, I would not suggest wasting your time and money. After I read the book, I was so distraught that I had wasted 10 hours of my time that I could never get back. If you are struggling with procrastination, you'd be better off with another book choice."
3,"A little ""preachy""","What I liked: tips and ""confessions"". There are some good ideas here.What I didn't like: too much talk, some a little ""preachy,"" and not as well organized as I think it could have been. With all that talk, I found this book difficult to wade through. Also had much more on personal/business relationship management that didn't seem relevant to me."
3,"Amazing Series, Terrible Case","I bought this DVD set in support of a series that I love. I've been a huge KKM fan for quite some time and I thought ""Why not support it?"" When it came, the box was all ripped up in the corners, it looked quite terrible. When I opened it up, the CDs were falling out. But, on the bright side, at least the DVDs were in there. Still, if the anime industry is trying to get people to purchase their favorite series, they're doing it in the wrong way. The quality was awful!"
4,An anime for good times,"Kyou Kara Maou starts out as the clasic reverse harem magical girl scenareo with a twist, and turns into something much more original and fun. The humour is spot on, and the plot when existant, is compelling. Unfortunetly, this series has not been completed in an R1 release, but the first season is the essential Kyou Kara Maou, so it is definitely worth buying this set, which has the first 38 episodes in a very convenient format."
1,all regions = still region 1,"Especially ordered the all regions version because i'm from europe, but apperantly all regions stands for region 1 and now i cant play the dvd's."
1,"If you already know something about testing, read this:","I have been tasked with creating a technical certification program for a mid-size corporation, and thought I'd arm myself with as many resources as possible. I already had extensive experience in creating tests and performing psychometric analysis of tests in academia, but didn't know anything about applying testing in the workplace. I found Westgaard's approach to be elementary and even a bit patronizing to the reader. If you have never thought about tests before, this may be the book for you, but if you already have some experience with testing, I would not recommend it as a way to expand your knowledge."
5,Great!,"I received a brand new copy of this book, which surprised me, as I would have had to pay around $50 for a new copy. It arrived in about 1.5 weeks, which was a little long to wait, but it ended up being worth the wait."
5,Pyro review,"I did use a demo version of this and was impressed. It is a combination of Spin Doctor and Easy CD Creator (except you can burn MP3s to CD). This program should sell many copies, especially at its low price..."
1,"nope, I didn't like it.","I purchased the online download version through Digital River. Although it downloaded and installed fine, I could not get it to run properly, even after uninstalling my other potentially conflicting CD-R software. It may not have been compatible with my Yamaha Cd-R/CD-RW.I also disliked the look and feel of the product (from what I could tell before it shut itself down). It didn't seem to have any data CD recording/copying features.Luckily, the company seems to be honest and I think I'm getting my money back."
1,Don't Buy This!!!,"This software is truly one of the worst software purchases I've ever made -- it makes Microsoft's first-run products look bug-proof. I have installed this on three computers, so far. It has become a game to see just how many machines this software can crash. Its features sound great, but I have yet to have an opportunity to use them -- just can't get past that ""fatal error."" I just purchased MusicMatch Jukebox 5.0 -- it installs, runs, converts files, and burns CDs without any fuss or problems. Buy that instead"
2,Dont buy this!!!,Mere words can not express my frustration with this product....to make a very long and painful story short I eventually deleted my hard drive just to get this program to work and.....you guessed it-- it still didn't work!! Lots of hassles- there is no toll free number so you pay for the hour wait phonecall......just to hear they can't help you. Listen save the money and download music jukebox or another MP3 converter for free that does everything PYRO is suppoesed to do without the headaches....
1,Good chance it'll cause a problem,"I read the reviews on Amazon, in particular the one's saying they had computer problems after installing. Well, I have a good Dell computer with 384-MB of RAM, so I figured my power machine could conquer anything. Was I wrong. This software gave me several ""Out of Memory"" errors, an error message I've never encountered. So I figured I'd go to Cakewalk's Web site for help, and I got the same memory error. I then clicked on the ""My Computer"" icon to try and troubleshoot, and sure enough, I got the same memory error.My only solace is I used my time-traveling software (it can restore your computer to a previous date and time) to restore my computer before I installed this piece of junk, and all is well.Save yourself a tremendous headache, avoid this thing like the plague."
1,Worst piece of [...junk]I ever wasted $$$ on...,"Unbelievable!!! After several e-mails, only a few resposnes, No satisfaction.It will not let me burn a CD without messing that up...E-mail them and when they DO respond, they give you a whole buch of things to try, none work and you just waste blank CDs...filling them up with random bits from each music track, usually 10 seconds at most of a song.Worthless...I have tried several other programs and this is the worst. AVOID!!!"
4,PROBUILDER FX STRIKER,Product itself fine however the instruction how to put everything together not clear. Lego has much better instructions. Because ot this I rate it 4 instead of 5.
2,"Comme-ci, comme-ca","Although SOAP may make you feel all happy and tingly inside, the repetitive dance music may make your ears feel like... well... something else. With too many choruses and too few verses of high rythym dance music, SOAP is perfect for the dance floor, but for casual listening go back to Girl Power."
1,Annoying and Bland,I found the vocals to be bland at times and annoying at others. The lead singer sounds kind of like Aqua on downers. I'm not a fan of this band at all and think all the songs are very forgetable.
2,I wonder why S.O.A.P have scored 3 number ones in my country,"'This is how we party', 'Ladidi Ladeda', and 'Wishing' went to number one in my country Lebanon and I still can't find out why."
3,S Club 7 Are Song Stealers,"Anyone who's heard S Club 7's album, 7, should listen to Stand By You. They might recognise it!"
3,"good idea, not very good prize",really was a great idea from part of 3dfx this card. is for who dont want or need a lot of aceleration but need the TV Out. The prize isnt very good. Realmente fue una gran idea por parte de 3dfx esta tarjeta. es para quien no necesite mucha aceleracion pero necesite la salida de TV. El precio no es muy bueno.
3,Great Storyline Lacks Proper Execution,"This was a disappointing read overall. The writing was often trite and choppy. It just did not read well and often the ""voice"" of the narrative did not sound like a young boy to me. A well-written story has a flowing style that is harder to define than recognize.However, kudos to the author for the concept of the story and inclusion of lesser known aspects of the Titanic disaster (that of the 3rd class passengers of various colors). The historical notes at the end of the book actually ""read"" better than the story of the stowaway. The author clearly knows and loves the history of the Titanic.If you love the Titanic story, you may want to read this book as a matter of course. I do not think it will live on as a literary classic but may do alright commercially simply because of its' subject matter. I suggest a reading level of 3rd-8th grades."
1,something good,Story is ok But AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF SELLING THIS ! very unhappy as this is a mini book....this is not indicated in the description....check size of books
1,This book is WAY TOO SMALL,"It does not measure up to the description.... The measurement was 3"" X 3""...the words were way too small for the size of this book. My daughter was not interested in reading these books at all and top it off, I bought 10 each of 3 series as stockings stuffer. What a waste of $$. Never again. Amazon needs to update it's description of the size. WORTHLESS!"
1,Captain Underpants,I recomend you to buy any oF the captain underpants books beacause there funny and cool especiallY Harold & George there the funniest characters in all of the stories.You should buy this book beacause you would be laughing out of your seat.It's about these 2 boys in elementary school that never go to class and if they do go they would be sent back up to the office. you heard all the facts all you have to do is buy the book.
3,"Great book, bad format","I love the Munsch books and had read this one before so I ordered it, with 3 others, as a present for a little girl I know. I was deeply disappointed when I found that this was a ""mini"" book. Rather than being the typical size Munsch book that I have bought in the past (maybe 8"" x 6""), this was only about 3"" square. The story is good and I guess the price should have been a tip-off. When I looked the item up today, I could not find anything in the description that mentioned the size. By clicking on a link I found that there were other 'formats' but as far as I could tell, none of them mentioned a size. Possibly the older version is more normal."
2,"Great story, but too small","I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this book. It's too small to enjoy the details of the pictures. The story is great, but it is crammed onto a little 3x3 page. I can't imagine finding any use for this tiny book."
5,"Love these ""bondng"" workouts with my baby - but had to get it outside of amazon","I got these DVDs after having my second child Joel, and only wish they'd been around for my first baby! You actually do the exercises with your baby -- (Joel loves the action) so with these videos I kill two birds with one stone - I get my workout, and for my baby it's ""playtime with mommy"" (and he's normally ready for a nap right after).*The only problem* was that Amazon never sends the DVDs (always out of stock??) - I ended up getting them directly from the infantastic website & they arrived in 3 days.I suggest starting with the lighter exercises for the first couple of weeks, then working up to the more challenging stuff. I generally alternate between the strength/toning DVD (Baby-Reps) & the cardio/dance DVD (Dance-Baby-Dance), depending on my mood. Dance Baby Dance is a little too long for me still, but I'll build up to it. Great stuff - I recommend it!"
1,Notfantastic,"This may be great a product, but you won't find out through Amazon. After waiting months and getting numerous postponement e-mails from Amazon, I finally cancelled my order. Although Amazon claims this DVD is available, I have a feeling I was never going to receive it. If you're interested, I suggest looking for another vendor."
2,Not too impressed,"The DVD arrived in a timely manner, which was great because I was so excited to get it.While my son napped, I viewed the DVD to get an idea of what to expect. It is explained to be a cardio workout, which is great, that's pretty much all it is. At first, I was somewhat impressed with the first workout/song, but then quickly realized the rest of the workouts were just slightly different versions of each other. It's basically dancing while holding your baby. If you know how to dance, and know how to hold your baby, then you don't need this DVD. The host gives instructions on how to do the steps before each workout, but doesn't mention if and how the steps help to isolate certain areas, improve strength, nothing. I felt like I was watching a kids' dancing instructor. In addition, the music was dull. A couple of the songs were OK (somewhat entertaining), but I couldn't imagine dancing to most of it, at least not in front of anyone. Sorry to say, I'm returning this DVD as soon as I can."
3,"Fun, but expensive for what it is.","This video was fun at first, but I feel it is very expensive for what it is. I could turn on my own music and dance with her for free. I don't think this program is worth the money I paid for it."
3,Buy elsewhere,"Do not buy this product for more than $17, the Infantastic website sells it for around $17. Anyone selling a used DVD for $49.99 is seriously ripping you off!"
3,"before you buy a battery, buy an eraser","I also have a V180, and after about a year of use it began to need more and more frequent charging. Before springing for a new battery, I decided to clean up the contacts on the battery as well as the spring-loaded battery contacts in the phone, to see if it helped. I used the mildly abrasive eraser on the end of a pencil, and shazaam! battery is as good as new. No need to spend an extra $18 for a new battery."
2,Doesn't hold charge as well as the OEM Motorola battery,"My original battery (I have a V180) lasted for about 5 or 6 days before needing a recharge. This is with the phone on 24-hours a day and 2 or 3 conversations per day. After a few months, I noticed that the amount of charge the battery held went down so that now the phone needs a recharge every 3rd or 4th day. I figured it might be good to get replacement battery. Well, I've used this one for a few weeks now and it holds even less charge than my original one does. I have to recharge every 2 or 3 days with the ""new"" battery. Don't waste your time with this 3rd-party battery unless your existing one is not holding charge at all and you are willing to settle for a mediocre solution. I'm looking for a bona fide Motorola replacement now."
1,"IT IS NOT THE BATTERY, BUT THE EARBUD",I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO CONTACT YOU ABOUT THE HANDS FREE EAR BUD I PURCHASED AS PART OF THIS ORDER. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE CALLER/CALLEE. NOT ENOUGH VOLUME. IT DOES ME NO GOOD TO USE IT WHILE DRIVING. PLEASE HELP.
1,Hope they aren't dry.,I received the cartridges today and hope that the ink is still usable. Both cartridges have passed their expiration date with one being nov of 09 and the other feb 10. The price is great and I can only hope that when I go to use one of these it will work.
1,Questionable Order/Shipping Charges,"I'm more than annoyed with the the ""Free Shipping"" as one of the ""Free Shipping"" options was some kind of ""trial version"". I shouldhn't have to have my Attorney review my damn order for some ink cartridges. Then, after I figure out the correct ""Free Shipping"" it then added a ""Handling Charge"" to both items AND SEPARATED my order and CHARGED me ""Shipping and Handling"" to the second item. Needless to say, I'm pissed."
4,song of the World Cup final,"Ricky Martin presented a platinum record to Michel Platini (nice play of words here: ""platinum"" and ""platini""), and he sang in the pre-game of the World Cup final in Paris. Great song, it is in spanish, english, french. ""Vous va gagner"", were the words in french, pointing to the crowds in the stands, and he turned out right."
4,Jeff Larson changes style,"I had previously purchased two prior cds of Jeff Larson, and I must admit, I wasn't thrilled with his earlier work. I had heard him on an FM syndicated radio show playing his work acoustically, and really liked what I heard. Once he donned the electric guitar and was joined by his badn, I felt his music lost the crispness and clarity I had originally heard.But his new work has grabbed my attention. I found it on Amazon and listened to two or three tracks, and was amazed as the direction sounded much more along the lines of what I prefer personally. While somewhat more mellow, he still sounded contemporary and clear; there was a message to what he had to say. Swimming In The Make Believe has received repeated plays on my cd player, with many more to come."
2,Past its Prime.,"Technology has outpaced this stellar book. As of November 2006, 78% of all home users had broadband (high speed) internet connections. Time for a new edition, please."
4,The Amazing Deception,"Christopher Booker's book is the most fascinating story of deception ever published. Anyone who would like to know a little more about Britain's real place in the EU should read this book, and learn of the deceipt, half-truths and outright lies supplied by the shadowy EU figures to give their takeover of half a continent a form of legitamy.If only a tiny percentage of Booker's account is to be believed (and it happens to be fantastically well researched), our new masters in the EU will have finally achieved what Hitler set out to do, and all without a shot being fired.For readers from overseas wondering what all the fuss is about, remember the old Soviet Union? Well this book shows how the EU has adopted many of it's traits. END"
2,WATCH OUT!,"I bought the Medium tent to create shade for my cat on the back porch. The tent is held in shape by the two long rods that you can see bent across the top in the picture. They are under tremendous tension, and two days later, sure enough, one of them spontaneously snapped in half.JB Wholesale customer service is amazing; I called and they had the manufacturer send out two replacement poles the next day. However they're made of the same material and will be under the same tension, so I doubt they will last -- we'll see. But if you are considering this product, I suggest you get the Large tent instead -- because of the larger radius the tension on the poles will be much less."
2,Weak Poles,"The tent appears to be well made, but the poles are very weak, and with minimal pressure snapped during the first assembly. I do not recommend purchase."
5,BUY THIS GREAT CD!!!,"I own this CD...by another name, though. Mine is titled ""Acoustic Spirit"", and includes a second CD with transcription and play-along tracks. Even without the second CD, this is a spectacular example of Romane's handiwork, and a must-have for any serious collector of Gypsy Jazz. Although he is not of Gypsy heritage, he is an amazing guitarist and master of this genre, as well as a great teacher. Romane has a great many CD's/DVD's out, but this is, by far, one of his best!"
4,fun spelling practice,"I got these puzzles for my daughter last December when she was almost 3.5 years old. She already knew her letters and some letter sounds and could spell cat and dog. She has had fun putting the puzzles together and spelling words. I recently saw them in her 4-year-old preschool class this year. They also have 4-letter puzzles.Cons: these are two sided puzzles, which can be confusing. Luckily they are red on one side and blue on the other so you can start by turning all the pieces to the same color before putting them together. They come in a nice heavy plastic case, but it is hard to get them in there.Overall I like these puzzles and recommend them."
4,All The Right Elements,"This is my first Patricia Gaffney book. Reviewing the long list of her books makes me wonder where I have been....and I read lots and lots of romance. This one has all the right elements. First, a wonderful heroine who has had a rough life but turns out to be loving and kind and smart! (Oh, what a grand store of information she has gleaned all on her own!) Secondly, there's the handsome compassionate doctor who is from the opposite side of the tracks and has a hard time imagining merging his life with the heroine's. Thirdly, they can't seem to resist each other no matter how different their beginnings. It's a great read....try it, you'll like it!"
3,Not my favorite,"I have read and really enjoyed two other Gaffney novels recently, but I didn't care much for this one. I enjoyed her other books because the characters have a certain depth and are more complicated than those found in the average romance. The heroine in Sweet Everlasting was just too sweet, too good to be true, and I found myself somewhat bored with her and the story. I suppose I prefer the slightly darker sorts of tales, and if you feel the same way, I recommend ""Lily"", and ""To Have and To Hold"" over this one."
1,Improve yourself,"Totally awful! No improvement, no style , nothing at all.Go and eat Big Mac at least it tastes!"
4,Great Addition To My Collection,"I like this figure. The head is a little too big, but it's really nicely made. The gun is cool and the bandolier and strap and pouch are nice.It can stand if you balance it just right, but for me it leans against the back of my case. I would get a figuerine stand if you want it to stand."
5,Weightless,"I have just finished the 5th song on the CD. By now my body is weightless and Im floating around my small universe, Incense flowing through my hair. One hand straight out and one bent, keeping time to the downbeats and my eyes are closed..and I'm seeing the future of this life...straight out in front of me. I am no longer ""ego"".Buy this CD. This surpasses even Baby Mammoth. And thats a mouthfull.This CD kicks. Buy it. Buy it today. Buy it NOW. Of 30 or so lounge CD's I have, this takes me out of my chair effortlessly. This makes me ...something...I never thought was there. This is the sound of the world turning."
5,This music always puts me in a good mood.,This was recommended to me because of some Theivery Corporation CD's I bought a while back and I can honestly say I like this album as much as any of my TC records.Come Touch the Sun provides the perfect variety of jazz sounds. A great CD for driving or just chilling around the house. I especially like 'foto viva' talk about smooth! Wow! Would highly recommend.
5,Excellent!,Please add more seasons/episodes. A great educational resource. We have been waiting years for these to be available. Encourages kids to read while also teaching and covering interesting topics. Highly recommended.
4,Good,"I have just downloaded this Reading Rainbow video. This is now my second. I use to watch this as a child, and now that I have children, I want them to experience this show also. Everything was just as I remember, except the begining title song. I don't understand why they had to modernize this. I wanted the original title song with the original episode. Beside that, each episode is wonderful, and eventually I will collect all of them. Only because of the title song, did I give this 4 stars. If it had the original song, I would have given it 5 stars."
1,"NOT AS PICTURED ,MISS REPRESENTED, NOT AS SEEN !","DON'T BUY, NOT AS DISPLAYED OR PICTURED YOU ONLY RECEIVESINGLE PORT MODEL NOT THE DUAL PORT AS SEEN IN PICTURE!3Com 3C980C-TXM NICS and Wireless Etherlink Network Interface CardHIGH SHIPPING COST TOOORDERED 2 AND DOUBLED SINGLE ITEM SHIPPING FOR THE SAME BOX SIZE. THINK TWICE. THANKS MUCH FOR YOUR TIME."
2,good glow but too soft,"I purchased this just before Christmas for a family friend. When the ball and bat arrived, I was horribly disappointed. The bat feels like cardboard with a thin padding - very easy to bend. Since nothing in the description said ""soft,"" I was very disappointed. I was embarrassed to give it to my friend as it felt cheap when you held it.But it did glow very nicely.Sarah"
3,Pretty Cool!,When the product first arrived we placed the ball and bat in the light for two hours so it could be ready for our night party. The glow in the items did not last long maybe seven to eight minutes. We had a hard time looking for the ball during our game when the glow went down.
4,"If you like 7 Seconds, you will get this......",This single kicks @ss. The only thing wrong is that is is a SINGLE. When is a full album coming...who knows. Buy this.
4,History but interesting,"I read this book and liked it alot. It is about a boy who is going to go across the Atlantic ocean and start over in america. This takes place a long time ago. I like this book because it tells some things I didn't know about the Mayflower. Stuff we didn't learn in school. It even tells what happens to the people after the first thanksgiving. Usually , we don't hear stuff like that. I would recomennd this book to anyone."
5,Grandson loved it.,"This was purchased at the request from my grandson. He had seen another model in Italy while he was on vacation. Even though it wasn't the model he particularly expected, he was very happy. It was bigger than expected which also made a hit. From what I can tell this is a great product and I will seriously consider more in the future. To make this more of an educational experience I emailed him information and pictures of this plane from the project manager."
2,The Cure at Troy,"Not bad, definitely Heaney. I preferred the Paul Roche translation, though. I'd rather a prose feel than a poetry one."
4,It's alright,"This game is actually kind of fun and it DOES use the remote. The only set back to this game is the types of games that you must do each level. Most of them consist either of dancing (which is like a Dance Dance Revolution- hit the botton when the arrow is in the correct spot), swimming (which involves moving the remote in the direction that you want to swim and try to go through bubbles and rings), or sledding down hills (which is similar to the swimming challenges but you try to collect different objects). Overall this game was pretty fun but you would not want it ot be your only Wii game. It can get pretty boring after a while."
3,Graphics are really awesome!!,"I have had the HAPPY FEET video game for awhile and so far is very,very easy! At first I thought it was just the beginning of the easiness. The graphics are very sweet. How can you resist little mumble? The wiimote use is executed very well! Allthough the levels do get to be boring after a while. Same three basic game modes. I beet the game in one hour on hard the whole way through. I saw the happy feet movie before playing the game and it was good! The game does a great job as making it practically like the movie with the gameplay. I reccomend this game for 5-9 year olds. Just don't waste $50.00 on this if you are over 9 years of age. Buy a different Wii game!"
3,4 year old crowd,"This game is for a very young crowd. My 4 year old son loves sledding and swimming-but the game is very limited in its appeal to my older children. If you have preschoolers, the game may be worth your while."
2,Good...if your ages 3-7,"Way too easy. I'm not the huge gamer person, but I beat the game in under 2 hrs. The levels are easy and boring, I loved the movie, but...this game sucks if you are over 7."
4,Fun,I bought this for my daughter since she is sooo into penquins and she loves it.It goes with the movie so you might want to watch it if you havent yet. You could be lost if you don't!!This game is for kids of ALL ages..
5,Highly recommended for younger children,"We finally broke down and purchased a wii, however, I had a hard time finding a game perfect for my 4yr old daughter. Until I purchased this game. It is perfect. First, it entertains my daughter with the movie like story line, then before each mini game it explains step by step how to play the game (how to hold controller, ect). It's easy enough for her to play, yet challenging enough for me to play along with her. We have a blast together with it."
5,review,"loved this game. it is a easy one and fun, it arrived on time and it arrived in good shape as advertised"
5,Surreal and lyrical,"David Niall Wilson is a magnificent storyteller. I have only recently discovered his novels and short stories and have been charmed by his poetic, passionate style.Deep Blue is a surreal, lyrical novel that hypnotizes with its rhythm. The soul of the novel is in the music, the blues. I could almost hear the waves of music, pulling me in to experience the pain and confusion of Brandt and his friends. As they make their way through a world shaped by supernatural and sinister forces I was touched by their courage and friendships.Deep Blue is a complex story about expressing and confronting personal fears, pain and the horror of the world and ultimately, through the music, releasing that pain. A story the reader will not forget."
4,A novel hard to describe-Worth reading,The novel Deep Blue begins with the struggles of guitarist Brandt who has hit rock bottom. Brandt encounters a elderly black man who plays the blues in a masterful way. Brandt wants to learn but is warned he must play the pain. After his first session Brandt walks out and the rest of the band splits up. The band reforms later after having time to deal with their own individual pain and set out to help their artist friend Liz deal with an ancient evil. Brandt has learned he must play and let out the pain he finds or it will devour him. Some authors tell a great story. David Niall Wilson is clearly a master of his craft and weaves an engaging story. At times the story does seem to wander. Overall this is a very enjoyable novel.
5,Monsters are Great,"I use these cables to connect several different guitars to amps, recorders and sound generators. Monster cables are the best you can buy......."
3,not what I expected,"After plugging in the cable I noticed that the connection was abnormally loose. I tried it with my Ibanez rgt 42fm and it was loose, plugged it into my telecaster and it was loose. Finally, I plugged it into my Hohner classical acoustic and the fit was snug. This is the first time I've experienced this and feel that this shouldn't be a problem with high quality cables. I will not be purchasing anymore cables from them, the quality does not match the price."
1,Defective: didn't work after 3 days,"I just needed a cable to connect my pedals to my amp. After the first day, I noticed that the sound would cut out, and I had to move the cable around to try to restore the sound. After the third day it stopped working completely. Clearly I received a defective product and it was a tremendous waste of money. Hopefully my case is an anomaly and it doesn't happen to anyone else."
5,as expected,it does what it's supossed to...... U can't go wrong with monster. it's been used with a s90es piano and wolrd flawlessly.
5,Good quality cable,"This cable is of very good quality. You can feel it when you touch and use it, you know it will last long. If you want to practice in a little room or sitting by the amp, 6ft will do it. Otherwise you will need a longer cable because if you like to walk while playing, this cable will be very short for that. Great cable, will buy again a longer one for different use."
4,Good,"Product arrived quickly and in good condition. Not noticing any real difference between this and a cable I got at Target. It seems to be neither better nor worse. Overall, functions as advertised and pleased with purchase."
4,gym bag,MY son uses this to go to and from the gym and really likes it. It makes his work out life easier.
2,flimsy and low quality,"Zipper pull came off, shoulder strap is very uncomfortable, not enough pockets, worst gym bag I've ever owned. Going straight to goodwill."
3,its okay,I really like this bag with one thing that kinda ruined it for me. The zipper was stuck on the first day and ripped the side pocket. ...i ended up cutting some of the material to make it work again. Other than that I use it everyday and it gets the job done
2,poor material especially the zippers,"I chose the bag because of the size, the features plus I was looking for a bag that didn't advertise the manufacturer. The price was cheap and I guess you get what you pay for. The material is thin and the straps are weak. ( I am waiting for one to tear from the body). The zippers jam and today one of the sliders went off track. Choose this bag if you are only considering using it for short term. As a daily gym bag it doesn't cut it."
2,Didn't Work Out Too Well,Bought this bag for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift. She seemed really excited about it. Lots of pockets and compartments and holders everywhere in this bag.But then she used it as an overnight bag to stay at my place. She only packed an outfit and some toiletries and the zipper broke. It's kind of embarrassing when she brings the bag over now because it just sits there unable to close. I'm looking at this as an opportunity to really impress her for Valentine's Day.
2,"Expensive, not good!","Not good quality, and kind of expensive. Not easy for carry on, easy to be broken. You can get a Nike as this price."
4,I Can Dig It,"This is a good quality gym bag. I use it for martial arts and there is plenty of room for my gi, outdoor BDUs, notebooks, pens/pencils, first aid gear, water bottle and more. The shoe pocket is nice, but takes up too much room in the bag, so I don't use it. If there was anything I could do to improve it, I'd suggest a couple more small pockets, just so I don't have to keep all of my loose items in the one main section."
2,Gets the basic job done but not what I expected,"The bag is a good size and I like that the shoe compartment is separate from the rest. However, it cannot keep it's shape. The shoes stick up, almost out of the bag, and the other end of the bag pulls up, so the whole thing becomes pretty much a wide-opened V shape. Stuff falls out due to all that. I will have to find a rigid side one."
1,Bag strap broke on my first use!,"I was excited for this bag - good price, good reviews, and (at first glance) decent quality. However, on the first day I used it, the bag strap broke off from where it connects to the bag while I was walking down the stairs. That's pretty poor construction if the jolting of walking down stairs (with 1 change of gym clothes only in the bag) breaks it! Not recommended."
5,Ensign peak gym bag,"Great gym bag,beautifully designed and the price is way worth it. Very nicely packaged. I recommending it to my friends at the gym."
1,junk,this thing is falling apart. a waste of money. poorly constructed. i use it once a week and the stitching broke after a few weeks. don't waste your money only rated a 1 because they wont let me rate a zero
1,Waste of money,"I got his game because I like to play poker. It was very disappointing. The interface is crude. The dialog is limited and frankly kind of stupid. Character creation is extremely limited and clunky. Worst of all, the poker play is limited and not much fun. I wouldn't waste your money on this game."
1,bad,I love to play poker so I thought I would try this game out and when I got it I new that it was a mistake to me it was not very fun!
1,world championship poker all in,"I bought world championship poker all in for wii.waste of money it was,when i got it sent out here in Australiawere i live and put it on to play,it didn,t work at all it was unreadable(blank)my wii only can read licensed to pal nintendoand if wii games don,t have this for the Aystralia model than they want play so if you live out side the US don,t buy this game.not happy and i can,t get money back.so i,m not buying anymore games from here. Tania"
4,I like it,"This has been a useful tool for my photography. I bought it when I purchased the 60mm micro lens but I've found myself using it with my 18-200mm as well.Like another user, the only real fault I can find is that it could be made a bit sturdier (or priced cheaper), and the refocusing between 1x and 2x is a slight annoyance especially if your subject isn't cooperating by sitting still. Minor issue though."
4,DR6 Right AngleViewer,"This is a nice item to add to anyone's arsenal.The ability to shoot low, without becoming a contortionist, was a welcome relief. I bought it for the D200 but found that it also fit the D300 and D40.It does feel a bit flimsy but it has worked as advertised.Ed"
1,failed after 3 days,"bought this and a C7005 for two different cars- both worked fine for about 3 days, then both quit. My other cars are still doing fine."
5,Best contact-management software I've ever used,"This software is by far the best contact-management software. I especially recommend it for independent sales people, such as real estate agents. Every letter you write, every phone call you make can be logged into a contact record. You can send your emails directly from your contact list (and boy does that save time.) You can interface your Palm V with ACT too, meaning you can have your customer contacts on the road, and update the information when back in your office. And it's not hard to use to set up and use ACT at all. Very user friendly.While Microsoft Outlook is powerful and useful for doing in-office correspondence and task management, it is not as suitable as ACT for contact management. Contact management is a specific job, and ACT does it best."
3,Ask their Support Staff Questions First,"I asked sales at ACT if their software would be able transfer files from Maximizer to Act and they said Yes. But, in reality, ACT doesn't have a way to transfer ""Notes"" on each record into the ACT program. Next..."
1,Haven't received download for ACT yet! HELP!!,I haven't received my download yet and must have it tonight.Please send ASAP!
3,"Great idea cost a lot, parts mediocre though","This is a great design item to launch a boat or something heavy. The price unfortunately is 3x times of what it is supposed to be. And the wheels - oh, man. One came with a punctured tube - though the seller promptly tried to resolve the defect for me. I decided not to wait for the the placement and bought smaller wheels at local hardware store instead for which I was reimbursed.Well, for the original wheels I found a replacement tube and decided to give them a try. The one I replaced hold ok, but the oher original tire blew up within 5 min (no load) and it tear apart the plastic wheel hub.It would also be nice if the push pins where attached to some key chain so they don't get lost. one managed to slip from the wet hands, good thing it was hard and shallow, otherwise replacements are not easy to find.4 stars to seller5 stars for the idea2 stars for the quality"
3,Nice Idea but still needs work,"Well designed however a little weak and difficult to put the wheels down while the boat is in the water. Since the tires have air in them, it's difficult to make them deploy down prior to pulling the boat from the water and in the process of doing this I bent my supports."
4,Stinky strainer,"It arrived on time and plugs the sink drain like it is supposed to, but the rubber part smells really bad like kerosene or something. You can smell it all through the kitchen when it's sitting out and not actually plugging the drain. Yuck.Update: A few months later, the smell is gone, so I added a star. I ran it through the dishwasher a couple dozen times and that helped a lot."
2,did not work,This product did not work for my sink. I thought it was supposed to stop the water from draining from the sink.
3,Blast from the Past,Waite was once widely read by freemasons who were fascinated by his personal reflections on Christianity and stonemasons. This book provides a valuable insight into the ideas and value systems of a forgotten world.
5,This CD is just the BEST!,"Like so many other reviewers, I had this CD 20 years ago. I was a nanny at the time, and shared this music with so many different children and without exception, they all LOVED it! As fate would have it, the CD was lost, and I was devastated. When I saw that it was available again, I was beyond thirlled and ordered it immediately! This CD is an excellent way to fight childhood obesity - my own children (ages 5 and 6-1/2) just cannot sit still when they hear this music - they dance and sing throughout!"
5,A kids must have and grown ups too!!,I bought this years ago for myself. I was 23 years old and loved it. Now I have a 3 year old neice who can't get enough. This is the only cd she likes. And knows what songs are her favorite and where they are. I have gotten 2 more for her. One for her house and one for my mom's place. I highly recommend it for all ages. It's got great songs and done in such a huge variety of ways.
3,One GREAT Song,The replay button will wear out for track 6 - Little Richard's Itsy Bitsy Spider..very lively! A friend had this CD and we bought it just for this song!
2,Disappointing...,"I'd heard this album many years ago when a friend of mine got it for her child and had never forgotten the wonderful version of ""This Old Man"" by Bob Dylan. I did not know the name of the album though and searched for many years before I finally found it again. After all of the great reviews here, I was surprised by how disappointed I was by it. The first half of the album is pretty good, upbeat and fun. Who is the second half for though? Certainly not for children with it's slow and boring selections and mediocre arrangements. With all the great kids songs out there how they came to include these is beyond me. I plan to record the songs I like and just ignore the rest."
4,"Good CD for kids, and Parents can tolerate it","Golden Slumbers by Jackson Browne & Jennifer Warnes is my favorite song on the CD. One night on the way home from a rare night out alone with my husband, there was nothing on the radio and I turned the CD player on and this song came on. We listened to it...I like to sing along to This Old Man, Chicken Lips and Blueberry Pie when I am in the car with my son. I am glad that there are CD's out there that both children and adults can listen to!"
2,Not what I expected,"I was really looking forward to this CD because of some of the artists. Dylan and Springsteen were great as were some of the older artists but I'm not into hip-hoppy, rappy, disco-y music and that's what seemed to make up the rest of the CD. Would not buy this again and would not recommend it for older parents."
3,Beware of Commemorative Editions,"I looked forward to this re-issue, but was unpleasantly surprised to discover that it's not exactly the original album. For instance, ""Golden Slumbers,"" the duet with Jackson Browne and Jennifer Warnes, is about two minutes shorter than the version on the earlier CD, and the ""new"" cut significantly diminishes the force of the original. Is this supposed to be a radio version? No explanation is provided. In general, the reproduction is thin--a problem I have found with other Rhino re-issues. I hate to knock a recording for such a good cause (the Pediatric AIDS Foundation), but I was let down by this edition of a great CD."
4,Great kids CD,"Our son enjoys this and so do I. Some of the slow songs are a drag, but all in all it is great for kids."
4,I liked it,Glad I bought it. Nice assortment of songs and voices and does sooth you to sleep ... adults as well as children.
2,A few good songs and a lot of mush,"The songs by Ziggy Marley, Dylan, Little Richard, and Springsteen are inspired, but most of the rest are tedious or downright sappy. If the proceeds didn't go to a worthy cause, I would return this CD."
5,From Ziggy Marley to Barbara Streisand a masterpiece.,"This is the best collection of its kind. It's been out of print for years so hopefully this reissue will garner it the attention it deserves. Buy it for yourself and you'll probably buy a copy for everyone you know. With or without children, they should love it!"
4,Great for beginners/Intermediate levels,Great for beginners/Intermediate levels and school students learning to play for the first time. I would Not recommend this music book for advanced players.
5,Excellent read for the whole team,"While true the author hits more on what rather than 'how', this is one of those books every sap project manager and technical team member should have, if not just so we can all speak the same language. No, it's not an implementation book (pick up Anderson's SAP planning/best practices book). And no, it's by no means a guide for administrators (see Burleson, Hernandez, or Liane Will's books, among others). It's more important, in that its the consistent foundation you can all build upon."
3,Excessive cuteness detracts,"This book is a good overview of SAP Netweaver, although it takes some careful sifting to determine what is there right now, and what is futureware (I won't call it vapourware because I have little doubt that SAP will deliver on it). Unfortunately the laboured attempt to appear non-technical and more businessy is delivered by means of a jokey cuteness that rapidly becomes irritating and detracts fron the overall package. All of the elements of Netweaver, with the possible exception of Master Data Management are already present in competing technologies, and thankfully for the most part the book does mention the generic name (e.g. Bulletin board) so that the elements of Netweaver can be understood in their context. This saves a lot of brain strain trying to find your way through the marketing."
1,worst book i ever read,1)I might have sat with the book if not for their jokes2)The terminolgy used in definitions and in examples is different.3)Repeating stuff that is not at all useful.4)The paragraghs of repition wont work but i dont understand how the pictures also dont work5)I sincerely request the authors to stop writing text books.
1,A totally useless book,Everything here is about vaporware. Zero useful information. All marketing statements. I highly recommend people to use it as a brick of fire log. You learn nothing from this.
2,"Fine for an overview, but not for nuts and bolts","This book provides an excellent overview of SAP's Netweaver, and might be appropriate for an IT manager. But if you're looking for a good technical reference book that you'd have sitting open next to you while developing an XI interface or a Web Services application, keep looking. WIth few exceptions, this book only tells you *what* SAP Netweaver can do, not how to actually go about doing any of it."
1,Not worth it IMO,"Buy the book if you like, but for me an ABAP programmer w/10+ years experience it was just fluff. A couple hundred pages of hearing how great Netweaver is and what it could do, w/o actual hands-on is not IMO what a 'Dummies' book is meant to be. The included CD was even less."
4,Excellent Overview on Undocumented subject,"This is great beginning for someone who is in SAP but want to learn about Netweaver. I read SAP official documentation and I feel the information in the book is very relavant.The book gives future trends very clearly and actually convinces you.Every business aspect of Netweaver is explained with an example.Moreover,you will love jokes and humour.Nice book to keep by the bed.I recommend reading this book and start reading materials on sap.com and other sap sites."
3,A very difficult read!,I found this book frustrating to read since Lawson constantly refers to the source material assuming that every reader is a professional historian. The main things I learned from this book was what we do not know about Cnut and his times. The source material is scanty but overwelming the reader with ambiguities does not help. I was not very familiar with late Anglo-Saxon England but the book should have been more accessable for an important figure in English and Scandinavian history.
4,A gift,I got this for my mother who has a Dickens village. I couldn't get a look at it because it was taped shut so hopefully it is not broken or was as expected.
1,Boring!!,"I enjoyed the first book in this series, but this book was just stupid. The characters are the stupidist people I have encountered in a long time. I could not wait to finish this book---it was a huge waste of my time. I should have quit after only a few chapters."
5,Great Book!,"Excellent resource. Clear, concise information and techniques that work for kids and adults. Good rationale, easy to find information in book. A must read for therapists!- Sarah (MFT Intern)"
3,Not sure if it works,"Perhaps a good over the counter supplement and one of the best among available choices. However, didnt see much difference. Doesn't work as well as prescription based enzymes."
2,Not as good as Others are Implying,"The book is not as good as others are implying. I wonder if the publishers of this book packed up this web-site with false, positive comments to promote better sale...The book is useful, if you understand it. The author does not do a good job of explaining his code.It takes some time to understand the code fully and properly. I found the book to be thought-provoking and useful. Following the examples, there is much to think about and understand. The best chapter is Chapter 3, on C++ Com. If you read nothing else, but read this chapter slowly and understand it fully, you will gain much benefit from understanding COM. A tutor, for me, was essential. But reading the book allowed me to know what questions to ask.(...)"
4,"Very good book, but .....","I think the book is very good. However, don't buy it if you want to learn how to create multiple threads in a COM server. The threading example is limited to a win32 application and the discussion about threads in COM is limited to threading models."
4,Clear and Straight Forward,"Iv'e received this book a few weeks ago and I was amazed how clear and straightforward it was. Explanations are clear, lots of nice examples and tips and tricks.I'm very satisfied with this book and I'll recommend it to my friends."
5,Best Book on COM,"It is a wonderful book written on COM. This book is easily superior to ""Beginning ATL 3 COM"".Mr. Troelsen's work is truly admirable. His methods for conveying his information was deep yet direct. I would recomend this book to anyone who is serious about COM."
4,many necessary steps missed,"Though the titile is called ""step by step"", it is not. Many important steps to compile a COM server or COM client are missed. The result is that you will find your sample project can not be compiled and you will be a dead meat.Overall, this book is nice but be prepared to consult Google or MSDN frequently."
2,Very Dissappointed,I feel this book lacks in very important information to help a student learn the basics of Emergency medical services. It is more pictures and not much information.. Our student pass ratio for the National Registry exam dropped very low the last year that we used this text book. It does not prompt the student to want to learn more. The only positive thing I can say is the reading level is low enough that you could start educating 8th graders on emergency medicine on a level they could understand.I think the quality of material could have been more indepth for a Basic EMT.
5,"An information, insightful, well researched book.","I would recommend this book to anyone. Especially those that were so rabid about war with Iraq. This book is well researched and footnoted. Learn to recognize when you are being lied to and manipulated by the media.One thing I find strange, is that there were some reviews on this book only a few days ago. And now they have been removed. Makes me wonder."
5,EVERY U.S. CITIZEN SHOULD READ THIS!!!,"I picked this book up at 12:00 P.M. and finished it by the end of the night! Rampton & Stauber write an unbelievable BI-PARTISAN account of how the Bush administration has totally ""window-dressed"" and lied about this current War in Iraq.And to the 2 or 3 out of 49 reviews that down this book - How blind are you? You must be an ultra right wing nutjob that DID NOT read the book to attack it! (Specifically to the person who said even Democrats were all for the war - It SPECIFICALLY mentions an account written by Congressman Henry Waxman of how he was decieved by the Bush Administration! - ONCE AGAIN - Did you read the book??) By the way, is your favorite show the O'Reilly Factor by any chance?????"
5,Nice Job! The best on the subject so far.,"Having read most of the recent crop of books exposing the true motives behind the reasons used to sell the war to American citizens, I can say that this one takes the cake. It brings together all the well-documented evidence in one very well-written and highly engaging book. It lets YOU, the reader, make your own conclusions. Who needs pulp-fiction in this day and age...when truth is even stranger than fiction! Don't let the silly cover fool you, this is serious (and often scary) stuff. Did I say it was entertaining as well? Very! I wish this book never had to be written, but unfortunately it did. This one of the most important books out there right now. Awesome book. Just AWESOME. I was thoroughly IMPRESSED!"
3,Don't Judge This Book By it's Cover!!!,"Don't be fooled by the cartoon on the cover. This book take some serious jabs at the Bush administration ""Weapons of Mass Deception"" discusses the Propaganda campaign used by the Bush administration to sell the Iraqi war to the public. Within the first 20 pgs, you learn a surprising revelation about the toppling of the Saddam statue. This is followed by a a dossier of the techniques used to persuade the public that the invasion of Iraq was imperative to National Security. With everything that's come to light since the war began in March 2003, it's safe to say, we've been had. Worth reading if you want a better understanding of how governments wage propaganda wars using mass media."
3,Stauber Is A Tad Goofy-Read His Review of His Own Book,"Stauber flashes un poco self-absorption in his semi-diatribe above bashing people for commenting on his book without, as he discerns, having actually read the book, and in doing so, suggests (1)that his co-author may be the better editor (see weights instead of weighs in the review)(2)that using this space for commentary rather than reviews is okay for him but not us. Now, I haven't read the book either yet nonetheless rated it with 3 stars because the subject matter needs exploring and because I can. Stauber, how about a brewski, amigo? We can talk and talk, you choose the subjects of course."
2,"Interesting, but thats all I'll give it.","Interesting reading, but remember to take it for what it's worth.I see a lot of reviewers that seem to think this book proves something. It proves nothing, it simple gives you one side of the story.Remember to read other book on the subject. And believe 25% of what you read and 50% of what you see."
1,Weapons of Mass Deception: Propaganda use to defeat Bush,"Typical propaganda book such as this one (and on both sides of the political spectrum) tend to make weak connections look strong to make a political point. This one goes beyond that. You need more than an imaginative bridge; you need to cross a chasm in a leap of faith. Just check some of the facts in the book, and it becomes clear that this is the author's attempt at getting his political opponents than it is about the truth. In my opinion this is a book written by and for the far-left activist community, however small it might be."
3,Keto diet - taste isn't great,"If you're on the keto diet, this water is great. It's one of those drinks you can have without restriction. The taste though isn't great. Though I don't tend to like flavored water much in general, so that may be my case."
2,Too much sodium,"I normally purchase Hint Water, but it can be a little pricey. I don't like plain old water, but juice is a little bit much. I like my water to have just a splash of flavor in it, but everything calorie-free uses some sort of preservative with a funky taste or they use excess sodium as a preservative.The reviews for this product were very good and it seemed like a better bargain than the Hint Water. When I opened the bottle, it smelled delicious - just like a fresh peach. The taste of it - not so much. It almost tasted carbonated from all the sodium they used to preserve it. I would not recommend it. I think I'll stick with my pricey Hint Water!"
3,"Great product, awful service. Will not shop with them agian.","Took company too long to ship a hat i ordered. Nice hat, bad service."
4,"I am a Paul Hardcaslte Fan : this cd is not 5 stars, But still GREAT","This is a great Paul Hardcastle cd. He is a proud father who features his daughter Maxine. Her song ""Smooth Jazz bumpin"" is very good but the other songs I though she did not have a strong enough voice to off set the Hardcastle music. I would have rated the cd 5 stars if not for that. Is this cd still great? Sure it is. It's Paul Hardcastle."
3,Hardcastle 4,"I thought Hardcastle 3 was better...You have a few very nice songs, but the music is predictable and is a repeat of Hardcastle 3, which to me was a better CD...I had a let down on this CD...I expected more...Go back to the studio and give us more of the true Paul Hardcastle..."
5,Haardcastle4,Hardcastle's music is beyond Heaven. He can't get any better. Always have been a fan. His music just lulls me. robbicee luvs jazz
4,What Can I Say About The Man....,"As typical, Paul comes through. This time he even through in a couple of pretty killer tracks with his daughter Maxine breaking out and singing for us. I give this CD two thumbs up, and a toe nail."
2,the lowend distorts like it was maximized?,The one good sounding song on this cd is eastern winds which is why I bought it in the first place. Seems like who ever mastered it tried to make it sound like a Hip hop album on the low end. Takes all the beauty away from it.
4,Typical Hardcastle. Great stuff...just a bit repetitive,"If you're a Hardcastle fan (and I am), you'll love this one. It's very typical, melodic stuff (just a little too repetitive. One Hardcastle cut will have at least two others that sound like it on the same CD). Still, his daughter is a very refreshing addition. The young lady can sing! She replaces Helen Rogers (at least on this CD), but it doesn't hurt the sound AT ALL. Both women are awesome. It's good cruising music, and Hardcastle remains at the top of his game."
3,"Good, but...","Paul Hardcastle has been an icon of smooth jazz for a long time. In both his 'Hardcastle' and 'Jazz Masters' series he's laid down a lot of good music. And while there's nothing bad about this CD, there was nothing that jumped out at me as particularly inventive or creative.Paul's daughter sings on several numbers and has a pleasent enough voice - but the lyrics seemed 'trite' for lack of a better word. For instance, 'Smooth Jazz is Bumpin' works only if you don't pay too close attention to the lyrics - because if you do, they come across as if written by a 12 year old.Smooth jazz doesn't have to be elevator music - but Hardcastle 4 comes dangerously close to just that."
3,Instrumental dance tunes,"This album provides some familiar dance tunes for salsa as well as something to spice the pot. I liked that it was all instrumental. But after listening to clips of each song on the album, I noticed they all sounded very much the same.I did like that there were variations in tempo -- fast or slower salsa. Some of us aren't as limber in Latin dancing as Smooth Ballroom.I also thought some of the more romantic numbers would make good Argentine Tango songs."
3,"Harmless, midgrade rock","Not too much to say except that this is decent and surprisingly varied music. It's a shame no one will ever find out about it, since his name is so obscure. This guy seems to be a risk taker, and many of them pay off quite well with accessible, catchy rock that manages to avoid inanity. Worth a listen."
3,"Better than some, but not the up to early Silos","Walter Salas-Humara became known (if you want to call fronting an obscure indy band ""known"") as the main songwriter/singer for the Silos. On the early Silos records Bob Rupe was a member of the band, and contributed the occasional song (which was always good). I'd highly recommend finding ""Tennessee Fire"", ""Cuba"" and the single major label record they did simply called ""The Silos"" (it has a bird on the cover).Walter Salas-Humara has always been better off when he doesn't try to ""rock out"" and instead plays more homespun fare like ""Mary's Getting Married"" or ""Commodore Peter"". There was a time in the early nineties when the Silos could have been a genius cross between early Replacements and Dylan, but it just never got there and then Bob Rupe left the band. Still check out the first couple Silos records as there are some great tunes, and leave ""Radar"" for more die hard fans."
2,aquarunners Rx- purple,"This is not a toy. Used to create more drag in the water while youare doing your aerobics. However, do not walk with them on concereteor tile surfaces. They wear out. Take them off or on while sitting onthe pool side. They do create the drag for greater leg muscle use."
2,To Tight,I own this product. The aqua runner is to tight and uncomfortable on my and my husband's feet. These are not easy to get on in the water. We will be returning these to Aqua jogger.
3,Fron the back cover,"""Libby Weatherby was aware that her jealous ex-husband had hired private detective Tony Pandolinni to follow her. In fact, she got a kick out of evading him...until she discovered that Tony wasn't the only one on her trial. Someone desperately wanted the mysterious locket she'd found in her pawnshop - someone who would stop at nothing to get it."""
2,Terrible recorded sound,I just doubt the logic of this one...the tone and colour of the recording lacks depth and even bite...it as if one flattened the sound out and turned up the treble in the Engineering department.As to the playing it is very fine but the recording sound is poor.
5,the secret letters of marilyn monroe and jacqueline kennedy,In the beginning very slow then the letters come in the book you cannot put it down.This book you can read again I higly recommend Marilyn Monroe to her fans to read this book
3,Not a serious read......,Quick read -- letters seemed so real until I re-read cover and discovered they were imaginary letters. It gives insight into the life and times of era.
3,Really?,"This was a very interesting almost unbelievable book. To think that they corresponded like this seems like a stretch of the imagine. Also the letters were very personal in discussing the intimacy between Marilyn and Jack. You just wouldn't think that someone who is President of our country would stoop so low (my opinion, of course)."
4,Marilyn and Jackie great read,I really enjoyed this book could not put it done. I think anyone who is a fan of Marilyn or Jackie would enjoy reading it.
5,Love them both even more....awesome and sad at the same time....,One of the best books I have read in along time...I even liked the letters format...it gave me great insight on both women..very sad about how things happened but would recommend this book to anyone..I have recently loaned this book to my sister in Iowa and I hope she likes it as much as I did...
4,Kept forgetting it wasn't real,This was a really fun read. I was enthralled at first but then it sort of lost me in the middle. I had to finish reading though and glad I did. So hard to remember at points that it wasn't real. The author really did the research it had a lot of historical accuracy thrown in. Overall good book!
1,The Secret Lettersof Marilyn Monroe and Jacqueline Kennedy,Did not care for it. The book is written as a series of letters between Marilyn and Jacqueline. The letters make them both seem childishly immature and transparent. The letters are given by Marilyn to an acquaintance of her to keep for a number of years without reading and she is told after the end of that time that she can make them available to the public. This woman thEn writes a letter to an editor who salivates over the letters and encourages her to have them published and already I'm bored with this review! I stopped reading the book after the 4th or 5th chapter. Not intereSting at all for me.
2,Not what I was expecting...good thing I got it when it was free!,"The book is described as a fictional novel. But, it is written more like a research paper or historical text. I found the numerous footnotes helpful, but tiring. I was in the mood for a light-hearted/emotional read, and this wasn't doing it for me.I am sure I would have liked this book more if I had begun reading it with different expectations."
4,The Secret Letters of Mailyn Monroe and Jacqueline Kennedy,"An easy read of what ""could have been, but highly unlikely"". Highly unlikely because of some of the language and sexual questions posed and answered by each woman. There were times when I thought ""Ya, right, like that happened!"". If you don't take the book as historical fact it is a good read."
3,Marilyn and Jacqueline,"The Secret Letters of Marilyn Monroe and Jacqueline kept my attention from the first chapter until the very end. The story was based on events that occurred in the lives of Marilyn Monroe and Jacqueline Kennedy. What if the two women had developed a personal friendship? Would history have been rewritten? The author included footnotes that provide historical value, making it feel realistic. I found myself lost in the letters written by these iconic figures in American history. I found the author's style easy and enjoyable to read. At the end of the book I was left with the feeling of what if...."
3,fun and easy read,"Fun and easy read, but in the end it seems a bit far-fetched. Maybe I am too influenced by the media images of these two women."
3,Fact or Fiction ?,"Good reading, however, I am not convinced this is factual. Seems a bit far fetched. All seems too out of character for Jackie K."
3,Cross country Skiing in Yosemite,"Useful book, helpful info on trails. could be more detailed, book was in condition described and was shipped promptly."
4,Comprehensive description of Yosemite ski tours,"This book has 34 or so ski tours at all levels in 78 pages. It covers not just the Badger Pass area but also Yosemite Valley south wall chutes (for advanced skiers!), Crane Flat north of the valley, Tuolumne Meadows, Tioga Pass to the east, and 3 Trans-Sierra tours. Detailed b&w topo maps trace each tour.What's missing? An index would be nice (although it has a Table of Contents). Also, I would like the old ski trails described. These trails went down from the top of the downhill ski area (near Tempo Dome) down to Highway 41. The one still trail that's still maintained is described (Chinquapin), but what about Strawberry Creek. Old signs mark the run. Also what about the trail from Ostrander Lake to Buena Vista Peak or Horse Ridge?"
5,Great Kitten Collar,"I am very satisfied with this collar. We cut it down to fit my little 8 week old Bengal baby and I'm going to buy another one when he out-grows his modified one.It stretches so I'm not worried about it choking him. The material is open enough that there aren't any holes for the clasp to go through--you pick your perfect spot and clasp it there. He's an EXTREMELY active little guy and this hasn't once come off him. I hate the safety collars for cats because my cats always got out of them so easily. (I know that's the point, but my cats weren't catching themselves with them--they just loved that they could get it off themselves.)Great product, definitely recommend, will buy again."
2,Good idea ruined by cheap chocolate.,"I ordered this basket for my wife for Valentine's day. I was impressed by the quality of the basket and all the little touches from the drawstring bags to the flowers. I was extremely disappointed that all this was ruined by filling the basket with one of the cheapest/worse brands (Palmer) of chocolate. For what I paid for this basket I would think they could have put some decent chocolate in it. I was looking forward to doing business with this company in the future, but now I will be sure to stay away from them. It is really too bad."
2,HP a1430n Crashed twice,"I bought this computer and 15 days later came in to see the blue screen of death for no reason.... sent it back to hp who fixed it and mailed it back to me ... one week later, I got the same crash. Don't know why."
2,disapointing,"I ordered this book to learn more about the Malinois and instead what i got was a quick description of the breed a hand full of photos and then thats it on them.. The photos were very basic. the information was ok but went on to discuss handlers, choosing dogs, and then KNVP.. all the informaiton is basic.. it only brushes over the information. The book did not even discuss traininng techniques in details... Very disapointing book.."
4,NOT YOUR NORMAL DOG BOOK,"The great thing about this book is its focus. Most dog breed books tend to look at conformation, rather than the working aspects of the breed. This book is all about the wonderful working attributes of the versitile Malinois. There is a detailed account of how to bring up a young dogs drive and make him tollerant of any situation. The author even discusses the KNPV exercises in the Dutch Police dog trial. I believe this book is perfect for anyone interested in owning/training a malinois for police work or sport."
1,Not much substance,No substance to this book. Anyone could have written it. It was a waste of time and money. Would not recommend to anyone.
1,Great Expecations and Disappointment,"Most of the authors regurgitate pretty much the same ""cautious-optimism"" material that currently dominates the China field. Among the authors, Christensen and Ross deliver their typically good arguments. But since the work brings little fresh to the table and its clear tilt (without much counter-arguments, other than self-hedging from the authors), I had to rate it poorly, given the intended audience... probably students seeking balanced viewpoints."
3,"Covers the basics, needs updating","This book is fine, as far as it goes, but does not address the trend towards using cast concrete pole bases and untreated poles rather than using direct-burial treated poles."
2,pole barns,Although the book had some helpful hints I was looking for more practical instructions on how to build a pole barn. The book did not go in deepth enough and had little information on pole barns. I was looking for ideas to help setting the floor grade and where to get started after lay-out is finished
4,Complete instructions,Excellent instructions from layout of site to cutting rafters and dry in-all in one volume. Am purchasing another copy for friends.
2,Old not a good book,"I'm disappointed in this book, its old and out dated. It doesn't really show how a pole building should be constructed and the materials needed to build one now, its based on the 80's. This book shows the use of timbers and older styles of building. If you're looking for a book to show you the way to build a pole building, what type of materials, and how to go about the set up of the concrete flooring this book is not what you're looking for."
4,Good Book for DIY,"Great for those DIYers. There are complete plans and detailed instructions for building the barns you need. Really wish I had gotten this book before I started building my house and shop. Many things would have been built differently. If you do your own building give this book a try, you won't be disappointed."
4,good book,a good book for fostering ideas about what and how to build. Info is abit old but much of it is still usful and practical for todays building projects
3,practical DIY book,"this book has been very helpfull and it contain infomation that was usefull to me, i am happy with my purchase"
3,Terrible Packaging,Could have packaged this alot better. All 12 thrown in one box what an absolute mess opening up this package.
5,Good old bluegrass,"These recordings go back to the beginning, before it was called bluegrass. Still some of the best. Possibly the most influential group in the genre. And besides, it's very good music."
4,comfortable fit and price with a brand you can trust!,"These jeans are quality jeans, don't let the price make you think differently, but what do you expect from Lees. They fit the petite stature perfectly. These are a good alternative for petite sizes. The material is soft, put on your body right away soft, no need to wait until they are broken in for that soft worn jean feel or fresh from the dryer feel. As for the price, you should definately pick up more then one before your size is gone."
1,"These are straight-leg, not tapered","These are not tapered leg like website indicates, if that doesn't bother you you may like them. I hated them and will not keep them."
4,An enjoyable read,"A lovely story about Australian brides travelling by ship to their husbands in England after the 2nd world war. I've read other Jojo Moyes books, and although I found this not quite as compelling as her other books, I did enjoy the story and would recommend to other Jojo Moyes fans."
2,Disappointing,"I had read other reviews for this book and a few readers thought that it was a really good read, another reader said it wasn't, however I took a chance with this book and I was really disappointed. I have read other Jojo Meyes books and thought they were really well written. The writing by the way of this book is excellent. I just couldn't get into the women characters in the book. I didn't like any of them, didn't care about them and found the story line slow."
4,Fascinating Insight,This is a book I could hardly put down. Found the whole war - bride thing fascinating. Could imagine how hard it must have been to leave your country and family and go halfway round the world to a husband you barely know. Excellent book. Will be reading more of Jojo Moyes.
3,The Ship of Brides,I found this book a little bit boring and thought it would end a little better than this! Although it gave me a great insight as to what it would have been like for these brides.
5,What an inspirational book!,Paul Orfala is an increasable gifted businessman. In this book Paul will teach you what you can accomplish anything if you leverage what is around you. Thanks Paul for your honesty surrounding your struggles with dyslexia and ADHD. A true inspiration.[...]
3,slow delivery,"Took longer to get than I hoped for. Really like this audiobook but one disc skips on a few tracks. No time to send it back and don't even know who sold it to me. so I just missed that part of the story. I like to order, get a good product and not have to worry about contacting anyone with a problem."
3,Not bad for a dislexic,"The book is very good and informative in the beginning. The details of about the creation of the first stores and partnership are very very interesting.Sometime after the middle chapters it got a bit boring. From then on it was filled with Paul's ideas on company culture, government and gambling (and how it relates to business) and who cares about that?Paul started his career dislexic, middle class and by his own admission not very smart. Now he is worth more than 250 million. Great inspiration for all of us."
4,Art for art's sake...,"Brust works art into a tale told about people, their emotions and their lives. While it can be easy to get caught up in the descriptions of art and the metaphors behind it, the real story here is one of people -- their progression, their advancement and their eventual change. A departure from Brust's ""Vlad Taltos"" series, ""The Sun, The Moon and The Stars"" was Brust's first book and reflects some of the deeper material he would later delve into with ""To Reign In Hell"" and ""Cowboy Feng's"" ... Overall, not his best work but a damn good read and worth picking up.."
5,Excellent Dietary Advice for those with PCOS,"This is a great book! As a vegetarian, I love the fact that she gives vegan/vegetarian options for protein. Do not be discouraged by the rating on this book that complained about the foods listed. I recognized nearly every food listed. It does not list just aubergine as one person that rated this book said. It actually says ""Tomato with Eggplant (Aubergine)"" So I don't know why this was even brought up. I have seen all of the foods in question listed (most at my local grocery store, some like Quorn at my local health food store). I own many cookbooks, so I do not have a problem converting measurements. I just convert them once and write them in the cookbook. I think the information in this book far outweighs the minor inconvenience of having to convert recipes."
5,PCOS Diet Book Review,"For those that have this disorder, this book is a MUST! I have found it very very helpful in helping me lose weight and get my condition under control. I love this book!"
2,Lay authors not saying anything new..,"This book is not saying anything new. The premise is to cut back on sugar and eat more veggies and drink more water. Now, really do we need to pay $21 to know this? They don't even mention root veggies that have tons of sugar a PCOS sufferer might want to avoid. This book has little depth, and I think the authors have little formal education."
2,The are much better books out there,"This book is only ok. It has many shortfalls, including the metric and food issues mentioned in other reviews. After trying this despite its shortcommings, I moved on. I would recommend the Foundation Diet. Though its not ment specifically for PCOS'ers, it has put me on tract, helped with hair issues and made me feel generaly better. I have lost some weight as well. If you do try Pcos Diet Book, be sure your measuring cups have metric."
5,A keeper,"This is an great album. I'm not a country fan, just took a flyer based on the reviews I saw. Only negative: some lyrics could use some finessing, seem a bit forced. Otherwise, this album is varied, competent in a variety of formats, but most of all is truly heartfelt. This guy is not 'all hat, no cattle'. I recommend it even to old fogey Byrds-y folk rock fans like myself.Starts off rock/bluesy,gets instropective. Buy it, listen a few times, and make a custom tape. You won't regret it."
4,"Good, functional lamp","This lamp has a solid, heavy base. Its transformer wall wart can take up more than one spot on an power strip, this is par for the course. The lamp was sagging until I remembered to attach the springs of the upper arm, which arrive unattached (it took me 10 seconds). Satisfied, recommends that item."
2,Okay.....,"The condition was not good and looked dirty on the cover. The quality was not up to par. I didn't like the paper and the lines were too far apart. I bought it because the cover was so cute, but once I got it I was disappointed. Once I finished writing in it I just threw it away."
5,Great Video Game,I bought this for my 13 year old grandson and he absolutely loves it. He enjoys the challanges and completing different levels of play by defeating his competitors. I highly recommend this game.
1,No Game Received,"The case to the game was empty upon opening. Therefore, we can not review the product because we were never able to play it!"
4,Not bad but not great,"More of the same. Not much has changed since Need For speed Underground for the ps2. Graphics are basically the same.You won't be blown away by the graphics, I was expecting more from the Next gen 360 version. Gameplay is the same. There's new cars, muscle cars are a great improvement. The gameplay is a little more challenging than before. Don't bother playing online unless your car is hooked up 100 percent. EA needs to drastically change the next title. Car selection is not so good. Xbox live marketplace offers some more cars, but to purchase.( That's pathetic)I spent $60.00 on the game, I should be able to have free access to all cars. You should rent before you buy this one."
3,Ok for a racing game,"I have played better .. i have played worse. The car models are sweet and the racing is kinda fun, but I finished the game in like 2 nights. A good rental, but dont bother buying it."
4,I wish the Fast and the Furious had never happened.,"The racing aspect of the game was fun, but the story was absolutely horrible. It was the lamest thing I have ever seen. The cars were great (especially the Challenger), and the driving was close to realistic. It's an overall fun game. If you like racing games and modifying some cool cars, then this is a great buy."
4,Good game,"I've played all the NFS games and this one is ok. I liked Most wanted better but I don't regret purchasing Carbon, I really miss the intricate tuning of NFSU2. I like the team concept applied. Buy this game if you like the NFSU2, Most Wanted. Why not? You've already come as far as reading reviews about the gane. Just buy it and you can write your own review! I'm not going to ramble on about my personal opinion or preferences."
3,A lot of silly sexy fun.,"All n the name of silly fun. No depth here but it is kinda cute. Being the Michael Pare` fan I am, I just enjoy himplaying the part of a ""sort of"" gigolo hired by a classy lady that has an extremely expensive health spa. She keeps a young stud on hand to keep some of her special customers happy, which Michael does... for a time. He has broken it off with his own gal pal but learns from this experience that ""real love"" is a lot more rewarding than plain sex. He has been trying to use this experience to write a book. He has been told he can't write ""women"" in his books so he is hoping this will give him the right experience. He sure does come away experienced... and tired. LOL Foxy Loxy"
1,Missed the mark,"This product is not at all what I thought it would be. Sure its cute, but overall the size is too small and the chalk holder impossible for kids."
4,nothing lasts forever no matter how wonderful,"This is a great play set because it does not break like ceramic or china. My kids like to put water (and real tea) in them for tea, and well, metal does rust. So, it may not last forever but it sure is fun."
5,Love it.,I ordered for my daycare. I like that it is not plastic. I think it will hold up well. I've washed by hand a few times with no problem - not sure how sturdy the paint is. They enjoy it.
3,So-So,"The content is good and the information is accurate but the presentation leaves something to be desired. I bought this to show to someone who is heavily ""infested"" with psychobabble and psychotherapy but she is not a reader and so a book would not be good. I thought if she could see a visual presentation she would benefit but she is a new believer and I don't think she would be able to focus on this kind of presentation. For anyone already grounded in their Christian faith, it is good."
5,Brooklyn's Most Wanted,"Any New Yorkers that watched this film with an appreciation for the authenticity it brought? I was happy that they didn't film it in Los Angelos and failed in trying to portray it as NY Brooklyn, apart from parts of Bed Stuy, Brownsville, Bushwick, also East New York is actually not that bad. I've lived in Harlem and Bushwick, and in Red Hook in the bad old days - and Brooklyn is no worse than the others. South Bronx = much much worse."
2,Not as advertised.,"The picture shows that it comes with a large variety of Kimono condoms. When the package arrived, it only had three different styles. It did have 24 condoms, but only in three styles. Not the ""sampler"" that the picture shows."
4,Informative and Lacks Inspiration,"This is not a how-to-book. The Root-Bernsteins present thirteen characteristics of what they view as genius. With each chapter they list examples from art, literature, and a variety of other disciplines. I have never encountered references to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Bruno Schulz within two pages of each other. The book lacks enthusiasm. Someone like Desmond Morris or Steven Pinker could of made this material really compelling. Still this book is more insightful than one that encourages someone to visualize certain object to make you an Einstein."
1,Disappointing and shallow,I found the book to be shallow and mundane. I wonder how much actual research went into this book. Use the book as a doorstop.
1,weak,"Skip this book in favor of spending time inventing YOUR OWN genius. If you think this is a manual for becoming smart, forget it. The gifts are doled out at birth and the best we can hope to do is make the most of what we have.Besides, 'genius' only means 'spirit'. The geniuses of the world are spirited people. Look inside to find that, not in the pages of this book."
3,some good information,"13 methods of creativity. Each given a brief intro and then, yes, into examples. But unless you feel you intuitively know what 'abstracting' is then I can only see that the examples add much needed depth to what would otherwise be a pretty flimsy coverage.This is not the kind of book that has 'creativity tools' as such (eg., Michalko) But this is more aligned with the thought processes in general that lead to the flow of creative thought. I found the first 4-5 of particular interest but must admit that by the second half of the book some of the ideas and thought skills were a little obvious.3.5 stars"
2,Good treatment of limited objective,"I like Simonton's book on the origins of genius and the Sternberg handbook on creativity. I keep wondering why they do not cite this work and vice versa. Other reviewers have listed the 13 types of thought presented. So, we have a chapter on a type of thought--what do we put in the chapter about the type of thought? It turns out we put lots and lots of examples of that type of thought being done by creative people of various sorts--scientists, artists, social leaders, and a few others. So we get a name of a type of thought and a paragraph explaining what it is followed by zillions of examples. This would in my mind make a nice 20 page book. At 200plus pages it is a bit of a windbag book. The earlier Root-Bernstein book, Discovery, was much more densely written with good ideas on every one or two pages. That was a really good deal--this follow up is a bit, frothy for my taste. I like meat!"
1,Dont buy!,I put this on my hair and it melted it!! I will now have to have my shoulder length hair cut into a pixie style. I cant comb it and it is falling out in handfulls!!
2,Did not work.,"I've had my hair straightened before with this method, but not this product. This was my first time using Ogilvie's straightener and it did not straighten my hair. I follow the steps word for word and set a timer for my appropriate hair type. All it did was leave a bad smell that most straighteners leave and my hair is still wavy."
2,Wow.,"Doesn't work at ALL. I've searched everywhere reading reviews, youtube, everything. And decided to try this product, and guess what? No results whatsoever, it should've worked my hair isn't a special case. I do not work for the company or anything. I know, somewhere in my head I'm always thinking that about all the good reviews I read, but I'm real. :( IT DOESN'T WORK."
3,It's okay...,It was kind of a pain to apply and it stinks but that's the price to get straight hair? right? Oh wait my hair is still not straight. I did what it said on the paper and comb it like crazy...or I thought I did and my hair still wavy...I don't even have tight curls just unruly wavy hair. Though it did relax my hair and it actually looks okay to wear down naturally without styling and not frizzy. After 48 hours I finally got to wash my hair and it still smells....hopefully after a couple of washes the smell goes a way.Would not buy the product again and now after reading the other reviews...now kind of scare my hair may fall out...so probably wait awhile before using a hair straighter or curling iron...
1,meh,"i followed the instructions and i found it very hard to brush my hair and it didnt really straighten my hair but rather made me rip out chunks and chunks of it. by the time i was done, i had my entire toilet bowl filled with my own hair. i was surprised that i still had some on my head! and the creams or whatever the box came with, made my hair tangled literally after i brushed it. nothing changed in my hair except now i have half less of it and its still poofy and wavy."
3,My hair is pretty dry now,It did what I expected....straightened my hair but kind of dried it out. I'm willing to take a little dryness though if it saves time in blow drying my hair every day.
1,Search failure,"Merton Strommen presents no new ground at all. What he claims he finds is nothing new, but a variation of the old ground of ""hate the sin, love the sinner"" routine. This is really an old work and contributes little but a rehash of an outdated understanding of sexuality. I frankly wonder what motivated him to write this book at all."
3,FAIR,"Was kinda looking for something moreBut this is fairnice quiet hourif you like your sessions mellow, you won't go wrong here"
1,Outdated,Don't bother using on any computer with windows editions past millenium. Definately will not work with windows 7. No product support either.
5,Sporster.,This modem worked just fine. I have since found that it is no longer needed in my configuration as technology has outpaced the usefulness. It works as stated.
2,It has good moments but NO REAL ENDING,"This series has some good moments, but the storytelling is lumpy (a seven episode flashback?) and the internal logic is really sloppy.However, the deal breaker is that it doesn't end--it simply stops. This is not an exaggeration. When I got the the end of disk 8, I went to the box to get the next one...and there wasn't one. It just...stops. Right before the Big Climax.Unacceptable!Seriously, this is like going to a movie and having the last reel missing. You can't win either way--either you like the series, in which case you'll feel robbed by the ""ending,"" or it's not something you'll like, in which case why buy it?So I recommend you save your money until the alleged next series comes out to complete the story. However, it's been a couple of years and so far no word on another series, so, as Dirty Harry would say: ""Do ya feel lucky?"""
2,Weird messages about birthdays,"My daughter has just turned 2, and loves the pictures of the cake, presents, etc so we talk about the pictures a lot.What I don't like is the actual narrative: at first, no one shows up for the party because they don't think they have good presents for Clifford. Is a birthday party all about the presents? I just don't see why the story needed to include this 'complication'. Later, Emily Elizabeth puts on a big smile for the person who gives Clifford a gift certificate for the doggy salon, as she passes it on to someone else. I understand re-gifting is a reality for most people (incl our family) but I'm not crazy by the fakeness of EE's gesture here.Maybe these things would be good talking points to go through with older children as you read the book, but we're far away from that cognitively, so I'll just have to keep making up my own story."
3,Clifford,Book is ok - my 21 month old daughter doesnt pick it up as much as her other books. I think its for older kids.
2,"Too inexpensive, wrong specs",This is not the MSA7020TB which extends to 48 inches. This boom only extends to 32 inches. The one I got also had a bad clutch and wouldn't tighten enough to hold the boom at full extension.
3,Broke it right away!,Was tightening a mic clip on and the threaded piece at the end broke free and just spun without resistance. I ended up drilling a hole through it and fitting a steel screw so it's fine now but it's inexcusable for the price IMO. Former guitarist friend had a similar one that did the same thing. If I was reordering I'd go with a regular boom.
5,A little money gets you a good boom,"I have been doing a karaoke gig for over two years now and I have wanted to add an adjustable boom for some time but I never took the time to investigate what I needed. I found the On Stage MSA7040TB and I love it. While it is not the sturdiest peace of equipment I have ever dealt with, it has performed at my shows most admirably and I love having it. The boom extends and holds it's position if properly tightened. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is in need of a boom stand.Thanks,it188"
5,Best CD,"Since this is a cd fro the hit radio station Alice then it is the best cd. It has all of their top hits including artists such as Natalie Merchant, GooGoo dolls, ect. I recommend it. All the proceeds also got to the Alice needs section. One which is the Columbine school."
3,"Ok, but not the best.","This product is by far better designed than the Springer.... BUT it's not the best. It is cumbersome, and not ideal... You want the dog to run at your side, not behind you.The Walkydog is the best, and safest. It absorbs 90% of pulls with an internal spring. I love it."
3,Not good for Apple TV MP4,Could not successfully stream the MP4's created by this device to my appleTV. I adjusted parameters without success. It does speed up encoding however.
5,The best book you can buy to learn some of the best tactics.,When I finished reading this book my number of hook-ups increased extremly. This book is like the Bible of fishing for Billfish. Buy it NOW!!
1,Total P of S!!!,"no box as displayed, it came in a bubble envelope. Okay, I can handle that, but the item itself is a total P of S. no wonder it's only $10, however it's really honestly not worth that."
1,does not work,tried it out for a week and all it did was hurt my skin..... wish i could return it.... horrible
1,Sonic Electronic Massage Belt,The actual belt is extremely small. Unless the person wearing the belt has an extremely small frame the actual belt won't cover enough of the body to have an true impact. The actual unit attached to the belt is also extremely small and flimsy.
2,would not recommend,"This was given to me as a gift. It worked for a little while but took me a long time to figure out how to get it to stay working for more than a few seconds. Finally, it stopped working all together. Not recommended."
1,waste of Money!,"the Vendor was very prompt at getting this to me, however it is very cheap, but it was only 10.00, but it didnt work to begin with, so dont waste your time or Money on this item."
4,Muscle Enhancer,"Its a great product for enhancing your muscles, but the product doesn't want to stay on all the time, or quits, and then the lotion broke me out on my skin, so I had to stop it for a while."
1,This product is not very good at all. I was not able to get it to work. Maybe it was the batteries. I don't know.,"This product was not any good. It did not work. Perhaps it was a broken ab sonic belt, or maybe the batteries were just not any good. I was not happy with it at all."
3,AB Sonic Electronic Massage Belt,"The AB Sonic Massage Belt works as advertised and is easy to use. The only draw back seems to be that it runs on thin nickle size watch type batteries. Two are provided. These batteries don't last too long and are fairly expensive to replace. So what you save in the purchase of the massage belt you spend on batteries. If you use the belt daily, which you have to do to achieve any result, you can go through quite a few batteries. If you don't mind the expense and inconvenience of constantly having to replace batteries the product is quite good."
1,This product fell,"This product is absolutely horrible. Do NOT!! buy this item at all. If you do, you definitely will be wasting your money."
1,Did Not Work,The ab belt did not work. Also the way the product was listed ie. Those who bought this product also bought ... was very misleading. There were two different names for the same product so I ended up ordering two ab belts that didn't work. Peh!
1,complete crap,Dont bother i wish i had of listened. The battery cover never stayed on. I was shocked numerous times because the insensity button Would jump from minimal to full blast and my son almost ate the extra battery.
2,Useless,"It is much like a tens unit, a tens unit has pads that make your muscles jump to make them stronger in the healing process after a surgery or during rehab. It is mich like that accept the only contact point is right in the very front of the belt."
1,Awful. Doesnt work.,Recieved. Broken I guess. Tried gel. Both lights don't turn on. No muscle movement. Even tried water like the book said.Don't waste your time. F-
3,Good but could be better,"I bought this for my husband who wants the body builder body without the work :P. I have used it a few times myself. On the small muscle groups (bis, tris, quads, etc.) the contractions can be intense and you definately feel like you have had an extremely intense workout for a couple of days. On the abs, I'm not as impressed but maybe it needs more time. I am disappointed that it only has 10 intensity levels. On my thighs I can turn it all the way up and maintain a comfortable workout. On the calves it can be a little too intense but I am making my way up.The blunt truth of the matter is that you get what you pay for and since I obtained this for under $15 including shipping I can complain too much.I would recommend this for beginners and suggest using it on the smaller muscle groups."
3,"Good start, needs improvement.","This is very inexpensive, and for the price, it is good. My only recommendation would be to use AAA batteries."
1,AB Sonic Electronic Massage,I was not pleased with the performance of the product. The belt was not long enough which caused it to be uncomfortable. Three molds on my stomach became red and stayed that way for weeks after I discontinued to use.
1,Ab NON worker,Not worth it. Was not satisfiet. It is defiently not as big as in the picture and it hurts...like it stings
1,the item was a waste of money,"the product didn't work like the indications say,and after 2 weeks the two metals which are inside(the part you are to place against your body) started transmitting electricity which was a danger to me. Presently i dumped the product and regret the money i spent on buying it. I can't even recommend it to someone cause i didn't even notice a start of change on my body."
5,Intergrates perfectly with my fitness routine.,"I love to wear my Ab Sonic while laying on the couch, eating Cheetos and watching COPS. Before long I expect to look just like the guy on the box. I'm not sure, but it seems like when I'm wearing my belt I can faintly smell the scent of bacon frying, is that normal?"
3,Missing belt,The description of this product says it comes with 2 belts. This product only comes with one belt. The belt that it comes with is way too smallfor the waist and too large for the arms and legs. Fortunately I kept my old belts from another unit.
1,Worse ab in the world,This product dose not work im a Athleate and this products clams are so fause in so many ways your better off getting an ab lounge at least that works dont way your time and money on this.i wouldnt even give this 1 star if i didnt hAve to put a star on this
1,Not good,I Ordered 2 of these. but only got one. nuf said. I was not happy when they needed me to take time out of my day to fix what they done.
2,Not what I wxpected,"I purchased this video to use as a teaching aid for a beginning sailing class. The author is from New Zealand where the sailing lingo is quite different from here in the US. So much so that I felt it would completely confuse a beginning sailor rather than facilitate his understanding. The video was more of a commercial for her film's sponsors and a pitch to come to her sailing school than a teaching aid. The only bright spot was that the photography was well done. It would have been nice to know that all of the action takes place on a 45 foot boat, not the kind of vessel most beginners learn on."
1,This song is so wack...,"This semi-cover of the Public Enemy original is so bad it's ridiculous. The beat is bad, the rhymes are bad: ""That's that ish right there/Whom shall I fear/Throw your guns in the air."" And let's not forget the clean version: ""That's that hit right there/Whom shall I fear/Throw your hands in the air."" And I don't know what Hurricane G is even doing there. All she's doing is talking and she still sounds worse than Puffy. By the way, what's up with that video? He goes from a black/lighted stage to a Southern Fried Chicken stand, to wearing furs in a moving chair. But the funny thing is, this is actually one of the BETTER songs off that horrendous album Forever."
3,Originally reminded me of Edward Gorey art.,"Unfortunately, these cards suffer from unexpressive paintings in the Major Arcana and playing card-like pips in the Minor Arcana. I never did learn anything about reading tarot with this deck, and would have to be really good with tarot to even try a reading with it a few years from now.I guess it'd be a good deck if you really didn't want the person getting the reading to get much of an idea of what the cards meant before you put your own spin on them. Otherwise, try to find some samples and only get it if you like the artwork."
5,Reality-based Taichi,"I have practiced tai chi off and on for several years but never seriously because I was not able to find someone could actually authoritatively show the actual martial applications behind this 2,000 year old graceful dance. It's a shame that in this country tai chi has been reduced to an exercise and relaxation program instead of being the rightful ancestor to all east Asian martial arts. Imagine being in the Forbidden City with 500 Chinese soldiers for morning practice/drill for the Emperor.This is a great video that explains and demonstrate the true origins of this powerful martial art..."
3,Not for me,"I read up on the side effects, and experienced some myself within 2 days of use. Biochemically, it just doesn't work for me. Well, it kinda did... but the side effects weren't worth it for me. Only one way to find if it works for you. ;)"
3,Don't know if they helped or not.,"I tried these pills for a couple of weeks. I honestly couldn't tell any difference. Do they work? I dunno. It appears they make a difference to some folk, so caveat emptor!"
3,How Do You Really Know?,"I realized after taking this product that I had no way of really knowing if it had been of any benefit to me. I already take a boat load of supplements and my diet and activity levels vary considerably every day. In order to properly analyze the results of any change in medication, diet or lifestyle, all other components must remain constant. The average person, unless he or she lives in a controlled environment, does not consume the same quantities of food and drink at the same time every day, does not exercise the same way and for the same amount of time each day, does not take the same medications and supplements at exactly the same time each day, does not go to bed and get up each morning at exactly the same time, etc.I am giving this product a neutral rating simply because it didn't provide me with any noticeable bad effects. That's more than can be said about many of the approved prescription medications out there."
1,"Not a ""cure"" for fibromyalgia","Just want to comment that there is no known ""cure"" for fibromyalgia. I find it unethical to label a product as a cure in the hopes of luring those who suffer."
3,"Well.....? - For me, no effect","Yes, this is a precursor, the brain should like it. So I took them per the suggested service size for the duration of the bottle. I felt no change at all. No change in emotions, sleep patterns, etc. I've used other Jarrow products and know that they are very good quality. But for this one your results will vary. For me, I won't be using this in the future."
3,Undecided,"I can't say that I feel much differently after taking these for a couple of weeks. Certainly no adverse impacts for me but if there has been a positive impact, it has been minimal."
2,Not for me,"I am jealous after reading a few of the other reviews. I was looking forward to trying this, but it seems to have had no noticable effect on me. I still have a lot of trouble sleeping and my mood seems to be the same. My husband hasn't noticed a change either. I am happy to hear that it works for some people and the product appears to be good. I still have some left, so I am not completely giving up. I will do an update if I have any progress. I can't recommend it, but it appears to be worth a try."
3,Not sure what to think...,"I tried this product to help with stress levels. After reading several reviews, I hoped that taking the supplement would help me deal with the stress brought on by work and improve my sleeping patterns. After trying this product, I didn't feel any instant change. Over time, I hoped that I would notice something, but my sleep remained the same and as far as stress went - I still have good and bad days. I really do not think this supplement helped one way or the other, which is why I'm giving it a neutral review. Everyone out there is different, so I realize that though it may not have worked ideally for me, it may very well help others. Given my own experience, however, I doubt I will be trying this product again."
3,"It works for some people, not me","I know people who have had luck with this, so I decided to give it a try.Unfortunately, it hasn't worked for me at all. It makes no difference if I take it or I don't.On the positive side of things...1. These are not as addictive as normal sleeping pills (not as effective for most either)2. It's a natural precursor to melatonin, so it promotes your body to create what it needs to go to sleep. It doesn't provide it directly, so it's a more natural way for the body to shut itself down.3. Virtually no side effectsDespite the fact that it didn't work for me, I can't give it 0 stars because I know of people who use it and it works well for them. Plus it's a much healthier, less addictive alternative to normal sleeping pills."
3,Who Knows?,"Personally I find that SAM-e works better for me. HTP seems to make me edgy as opposed to relaxed. This stuff definitely had a noticeable effect so if you like this stuff it's probably good and potent. Just not the effect I am looking for as I'm edgy enough as is. So, I stopped taking it.But as I said if HTP is your thing than this seems to be good stuff. But I would certainly HTTP HTP first to make sure there aren't any contraindications."
3,It's worth a try...,"I tried this an was not completely satisfied. I don't know if it is me, but it seemed to work only sometimes...not consistently. I may not be following the directions exactly and that may be the cause, I don't know. But if you're gamey it's worth a try."
4,Helped with sleeping,This seems to be a good alternative for help in sleeping. With hectic and demanding schedules I sometimes need something to naturally relax.I've had some unpleasant experiences with Melatonin that seem to be less noticeable with 5-HTP.Probably should get a Doctors okay.
2,Didn't work for me,Left my hair very dry. Thankfully it didn't cost too much. Am disappointed it didn't work. I also used the shampoo and serum.
1,Not as good as the shampoo,"For me, this conditioner works against the Thicker Fuller Shampoo.While my hair retained the softness, it was no longer fuller and fluffy.Item does not work well on fine, limp hair.It also has a terrible chemical smell to it.Will not use."
1,Did not work for me.,"I have normal hair but not a lot of it. It did nothing for my hair. It may work better on fine hair, not sure. I found much more success with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo & conditioner. It makes my hair look very full & shiny."
5,No better conditioner,"I've tried a lot of conditioners and there isn't anything better at any price point. Gives hair thicker appearance, and more importantly doesn't weight it down. I have tried expensive salon conditioners that don't work half as well that cost over $30. For $3 its a steal."
5,For thinning hair,"This product is excellent for anyone with thinning hair, and really does a good job. Sometimes hard to find in stores, it is available on Amazon!"
5,EXCELLENT,Excellent movie even if not into mtn biking....My parents watched it just for the scenery....The places were beautiful but of course now my hubby wants to take his bike and go!! LOL
5,Incomparable,"I think it's safe to say I own pretty much every MTB movie there is. And not a single one is comparable to WHERE THE TRAIL ENDS concerning images, pictures, sounds, music, narration, riding locations, shooting style and simply overall production effort. Only disadvantage you will experience when buying this item: You just can't seem to imagine there will ever be a better MTB movie. Ever."
5,Great Product,This study guide came fairly quickly and in great shape. The printing was clear and it was al in order. I would recommend this product.
1,A terrible book for someone who needs real healing,"The very premise of this book is terrible. Women are told over and over how they should feel and judged as unchristian if they don't. I am a lay counselor with over 35 years experience, most with women who have been sexually molested. This book denies women the right to feel, the right to need, the right to have emotions. They are specifically told that normal desires from their husbands are sinful. It is FULL of shame. For the hurting, wounded woman who knows only performance, it is a cruel handbook indeed. There are more shoulds and shouldn'ts in this book than any I have seen. So they think, ""if only I do one more thing he'll accept me."" Just like dad. This book is bondage...Christ is freedom!"
1,I really disliked this book,"I really did not like this book at all. Because God made so many varied individuals and so many differing personalities, I am untrustworthy of any book that seeks to place an overemphasis on the behavioral role of women in marriage. We are all responsible to obey God and follow the Word, but for goodness sakes, there is no ONE mandated and rigid Christian formula for marriage. If you are type that firmly believes that the responsibility solely lies in your hands to ""submit"" to your husband...while totally ignoring the previous passage of how he needs to love you like Christ loves the church, I'm sure you will love this book. I, however, did not."
2,The Excellent Wife Study Guide,I can not use the book. I did not know the previous owner had written in it. So I will have to purchase another book.
2,Misrepresented item,"I feel that this item was misrepresented, as there is no mention in the description that says it is a ""study guide"". I purchased this book thinking it was the complete volume, but received a study guide instead. Please make your descriptions COMPLETE!"
1,Antiquated and stiff,"It is truly a wonder that Jesus hasn't already returned to Earth to pass judgement on socially blinded and hypocritical people like Martha Peace. Are we to believe that women's role in society today should be as it was 2000 years ago? Keep ""Catcher in the Rye"" and burn this book you stupid facist."
1,Poor Product,This product was horrible. Veggies cooked inconsistently (same batch would vary from almost raw to soggy) it also took much longer then any other steamer I have ever used.The steamer left puddles on the counter and was difficult to refill while operating (and it needed to be refilled).I tossed it out after five ruined meals.
2,Disappointing DVD,"Face it, This was a widescreen movie. On the DVD however, it has been encoded using 1.33:1, the tasteless TV format with only 2 sound channels. I did not read the technical details before i bought it. I think you should read the details. It is like watching a movie with good VHS resolution. nothing more! What have North Americans done to deserve censored DVD versions of European movies. They pay the same price and it is not for public use. Any DVD without 5.1 channel or DTS sound and without anamorphic widescreen dimensions i.e 2.25:1 should be avoided. The stunning beauty of young Sharon Stone makes up for these technical goofs."
4,"Sharon Stone before ""Basic Instinct""","If you're a devoted Sharon Stone fan you'll love this film. The film is LOW budget and with the exception of Stone, the rest of the cast is virtually unknown. Stone is up to her old tricks with seducing men and taking control in the bedroom. The plot isn't the greatest but you're not purchasing this DVD for the plot...are you? You're buying it to see ALL of Sharon Stone....and you get most of it. If you're grossed out by bullfighting this isn't a film for you. The best scene involves Sharon Stone making love outdoors. Very realistic. Adult viewing NOT for the kids."
1,Incredibly awful remake of great classic,"Blood and Sand was made twice before, in 1922 with Rudolph Valentino and 1941 with Tyrone Power. The first version was good but not excellent, but Tyrone's version was, mostly due to the lavish Technicolor and the excellent supporting cast. But this 1989 remake is absolutely ridiculous; it shouldn't have been made to begin with. None of the stars can save the plot, which is marred a thin, convoluted plot. So if you want to see this bullfighting story, do NOT get this version. Instead get the 1941 version with Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell and Rita Hayworth. You will not be disappointed. Trust me."
1,it waka bada bad,this cd _ _ _ _ _ _ stinks i mean i dont have it but did you see the danm reveiw on this thing.
3,Nice Song,"This is a decent song by John Heric, but who will pay over $10.00 for it? NOBODY!! Earl sounds good though."
1,Not worth the money and dangerous too!,"This is a poor performing ""toaster"". Even at room temperature the hot dogs take too long to cook, much longer than the buns. The buns also burn on the edges because they come in contact with metal. The top of the unit gets very hot so be sure to keep kids away from it when in use."
2,not very good,"Had to use skinny hot dogs or you could not get them out of the machine, holes for buns were not big enough. Unable to make a good hot dog."
1,Junk. Aviod unless you like 'em raw.,"Those that rated this product one star are absolutely right. This ""toaster"" does not cook the hot dogs even remotely thoroughly. Buns burn. Device gets too hot and is most likely an electrical hazard. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!"
2,not working,"I bought this in March 2011 and here it is June and its not working. I liked the performance when it worked but I think after about six times using it, it should still work., very unhappy"
3,Works good for a while,This machine cooked hot dogs that were delicious...however after a very short time of use (about a month) mechanism to push the hot dogs down to cook often pops up early (5-10 seconds) or will not stay down at all.
2,Great for a few hours,I bought this product for my husband for Christmas. After 3 uses the handle broke off and there is no way to repair it. Loved the toaster but very cheaply made.
2,Hot Dog Toaster,I bought this as a gift for a boy who really likes hot dogs. It does not cook the dogs very well at all. You have to cook the dogs 3 or 4 times then put in the buns to make it work. I think his parents took it to the goodwill.
3,"Just ""ok""","Just like everyone else mentioned - make sure you use regular hot dogs. The other kinds get stuck. The bun warmer burns the buns, but I expected that. The best way to use this is put the dogs in for one cycle. After they pop up, put them down again and this time add the buns.The unit itself feels flimsy, but seems to work ok. There's a BIG BAD plastic smell the first few times you use it, but they tell you in the packaging to expect that.It's the only one I've found on the market. For the money, it's ok."
1,bought NEW they sent USED,"I just received this product, and when I opened the box it looked ok but the cord is all greasy and covered in old sticky food. I paid full price $29.56 for a brand new hot dog toaster and its disgusting and a refurb."
1,DONT BUY THIS,"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. It is very poorly assembled, and was ruined by the third time we used it. I bought it as a silly present for my dad who loves his HotDog's but was really dissapointe when I saw the entire toaster all wobbly and unsteady....it looks cheap and it is."
3,Hot Dog Toaster,"I bought this for my husband as a gift from Santa - he loves hot dogs so I thought this would be great! I, myself, like toasted buns so I thought it would be great as well. I also bought him 5 packages of Ball Park Franks...they don't fit after toasting because they plump when they cook. The toasted buns aren't evenly toasted either. We purchased Oscar Meyer hot dogs and that seemed to do the trick! I give it a rating of 3 out of 5 stars."
4,Good for kids and husbands who dont do dishes,"I bought this for my boyfriend because he loves hotdogs and never does dishes... figured i would kill two birds with one stone. Sure its not like hot dogs off the grill or like boiling them but it does a fine job of heating it up evenly and warming up the buns and the best part is there is no clean up afterwords (now if only i could get him to put this back in to the pantry). p.s. if you dont put two sets of hot dogs in at the same time sometimes when the dog is done it shoots up so fast the hot dog will jump right out of the toaster, I'm not kidding."
3,works ok,"My husband won this at a work event. Even though he didn't win the top prize he was ridiculously excited about his hot dog maker. The biggest negative to this product is that it burns the bun. The hot dog gets done but the bun is OVER done. All things said, he will be taking it to work and leaving it in the break room for everyone to use, since we will never use this at home again."
2,Hohner must stick with Chromatic,"I have always played Hohner Chromatic Harmonicas over the years (playing since 6 years old). Around the time I started playing my little Hohner Chromatic with the button, my cousin had a Butterfly Tremolo and I used to borrow it now and then because of the beautiful shimmering sound it produced and which I could not produce on my Chromatic. With the Echo Celeste I was expecting something like that but I was utterly disappointed. The sound is ok but it sits really uncomfortably in the mouth and the keyholes are too small as well so if you are playing single blow and draw notes you have to be really careful not to play the wrong note. While is is something that one can get used to after playing a while, the discomfort of the instrument not sitting comfortably in the mouth is not something that will go away with practice."
4,beautiful item,"I like the pattern on this harmonica very much. It makes accurate sounds. But I think it's a little expensive for me since its counterparts in china is much cheaper.Maybe I should buy it in china, since this is also a made in china item."
4,"Very rich, but somewhat greasy moisturizer","I bought this moisturizer as an economical alternative to L'Occitane's.As other reviewers state, it is very rich, need to dig it out from the jar.I use it after shower and after swimming to keep the skin well moiturized. However, it is somewhat greasy right after application, so I probably will use this for cold weather months."
3,Careful When Using On Hair...,"I tried this on my unrelaxed African American hair; I melted it down (about 4-5 tablespoons) and applied it liberally. It ended up leaving large solid white chunks of Shea in my hair. I had hoped it would be similar to coconut oil, but it was not. That was not fun to get out :(. I use it in hair mixtures with other products now, but I think it still has the same effect (hardening once it reaches room temperature).Anyhow, I have used this once or twice on my skin and it seems fine, very mosturizing. Take care when using it on your face, because it might clog your pores. :)"
4,The most comprehensive DOCTOR WHO episode guide around,"This fifth volume (of a projected six) in the ABOUT TIME series covers seasons 18-21 of DOCTOR WHO, examining adventures of the fourth and fifth Doctors. In addition to production notes and an critique of each episodes, there are notes and essays on continuity and the series in a cultural context. While not as handy as a one volume guide, the ABOUT TIME series makes for a much more interesting read."
3,Looks ok,"You may need to be a Rolls lover to enjoy this model , it lacks detail but it should still be fun to paint and assemble , not as nice as I hoped. G"
5,Amping up the Power,The price for the power supply was unbelievable for the quality and performance. And worked perfect for powering up my setup.
3,not a pop-up book!,I am somewhat disappointed with this book because it is labeled a lift the flap pop-up book but...ITS NOT! The only page that pops up in this book is the very last page - 1 pop-up. I thought this was the book my father used to read to me that every page was a popup but i'm afraid that book is alot more expensive to find now!
5,Great Fun for Young and Adults Alike!,"Somehow, after eating a bowl of alphabet soup, Martha the dog can speak! (There's a very funny illustration of the letters going to her brain instead of her stomach; no further explanation is necessary!). But being able to speak is not the same as knowing when to speak (she interrupts people), how much to say (she talks incessantly), or what to say (she can be a little rude at times).A very funny book, with nice loopy pictures, a subtle lesson in manners, and a happy outcome (except for the would-be burglar). One of a series of ""Martha"" books, this would make a great gift for young children, and is one of those special finds that adult will enjoy reading as well!"
5,Loving this book!,"I'm 30 years old, and BEG my nieces to let me read this to them over and over! I'm not only a dog lover, but I also appreciate the hysterical humor and illustrations. This book will please kids and adults alike! (Favorite line: ""Martha, SHUT UP!"" (It's funny when you read it!)"
2,Martha Speaks and so does her family,"I purchased this book because my first graders LOVE dog stories and I was impressed by the awards listed. It is a fun and enjoyable story which is unfortunately deemed inappropriate for classroom use because of the huge SHUT UP page half way through the book. What a shame! In a read aloud situation, you can't really change the words when they take up an entire page. What was this author thinking????????????????? You may want to move on to Martha Calling instead."
3,inaccurate book discription,"I purchased book in used but good condition. Detail was left out that an adhesive name tag on inside front cover was half ripped off. I gave this book as a gift; however, if name was just written, I could have blacked it out with a marker and it would have looked better than a ripped up sticker that I could not remove. I realize the book was used, but this detail was left out of the description."
5,"Sweeping, passionate romance","In My Heart is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. It reminds me of early Kathleen Woodiwiss novels. I was taken away to another place and time. I could feel the soot of London, see the displays in the museum, and could feel the tension and passion of Alex and Christopher from the moment they meet again, after a decade of separation and heartbreak. The hero and heroine have to let go of their pasts in order to find happiness in the future. I can't wait for the next book in the series to be published!"
4,In My Heart (Donally Family),"Beautifull Story!I started this book in the afternoon and continued through the night. I couldn't put it down. The author draws the reader into the story. You feel the heartache Alexanda feels, how domineering her father is but I truely believe he loved his daughter. You feel what Christopher feels as he tries to fight his feelings for her. The pain of the two major characters is felt. Throughout the story you keep wondering who the person is that is stealing the jewels. I never thought it would turn out to be Professor Atler and her uncle at that. Like many readers I hated the story had to end but I would have liked something more in the ending. Yes, they marry but maybe down the road she does have children. Her father and them make amends. Anyway loved it."
3,not quite right,"This book should have been good, but it just didn't quite make it. I didn't really like Alexandra or the way she acted. Christopher was allright, but not one of the best heroes in books today. The book felt sort of messed up--not real smooth. I have read the sequel to this book. I read this because these characters were in the 2nd book and I wanted to read their story. It wasn't what it could have been."
3,I just dont know.,"Im really not sure what to make of this book. For the most part, the first half of the book was really bad. I did not like either main character, Christopher was a jerk, Alexandra let him walk all over her, Lord Ware was not likeable either. I really did not like Ryan. I cant even use the right word to describe him. It was also really confusing. All over the place. Love scences were rushed and not all that great anyway. The end had some ok parts. It was definetly better then the first half but not by much. I really did not care for this book, I thought I would like it. I figured it would be good, I have read her under Laura Renken, but this writing was terrible. Nothing like LR. Weird. I might get the second book, I might not. I will definetly read all reviews before hand if I do decide to read it, even then, I might get it from the library. Read at your own risk!!"
3,The Holocaust from a Hungarian point of view...,"This story, based on the author's mother's experiences as a young Jewish girl growing up in Hungary was an absorbing read. We follow Marika through ten years of her life, from her parents' separation to the rise of Hitler. Marika's transformation through some very tough years makes you feel as if you can relate to her. This book is more character-development driven than plot-driven, but I still found interesting, probably because of the feelings I developed for the young Marika."
5,Coca Cola glasses,I purchased 2 of these at Dollar Tree last year. So far they have held up better than any other glass we have. My husband and I prefer them to all other glasses we have in our home. Great glasses!
4,"Finally, someone reads the Bible with some passion","Max McClean is great. He reads the Bible as if he is the author. Max McClean put emphasis and emotion throughout the Word. Very enjoyable. It really helps me in Bible study to be able to listen to a whole letter or at least several chapters at one time--and read with passion. Thankfully, in his enthusiasm he avoids undue overdramaticism. I really appreciate his work.Be blessed,--Jeffrey"
1,Opened during shipping,"This product was improperly packaged and opened during shipping, causing shampoo to leak all over the other products in the box and leaving me with only a partial bottle of shampoo. The product itself is nothing special, but the price was good, so I feel I got what I paid for."
5,Highly Rated on Scent Only!!!! It Smells SOOOOOOO GOOD!,"Hi! I'm rating this product highly only becuase it smells so good. I actually have a shaved head so I can't attest to it's qualities as a thickener. However, I am a big fan of citrus-scented products and Thicher Fuller Hair shampoo is a pleaser. It smells like they took a fresh squeezed orange and put it in a bottle. It smells so yummy, i use it for shampoo and shower gel. I wish they had a body lotion to compliment it! :)If you like your shampoo to have a citrus scent, you'll love this product. It's not overpowering or fake smelling. It's the perfect orange smell! For those of you with thin hair, I hope it lives up the it's name as well! :)"
2,not thicker,"The shampoo didn't make my hair thicker. It did the opposite. Stripped all the moisture out and the thin hair that I do have. Might have well be in chlorinated pool water. I guess it will make your hair look fuller, if you consider dried and puffed out to be fuller."
3,This was too drying for my hair,"I find this shampoo to be too drying for my hair. So, if you have dry hair to start with, then this may not be the product for you. That is not the shampoos fault, but just something I noticed. Of course, maybe that is how it is supposed to make hair fluff up...but removing the oils that maybe holding the hair down? The shampoo is fine, I just wanted to let others who may have dry hair to start with, that this may dry it even further."
2,Ehhh....,"This is a well written and clever book, and the author is very talented. The thing is, I'm a little irritated and bored by the story of a 20-something, commitment phobic, seemingly adolescent kind of guy who is such an emotional midget that he can't even say ""I love you."" The protagonist reminds me of the quintessential young (immature) single guy whose self destructiveness is matched only by his narcissism...the kind of guy women (girls?) really go for until they get a little older and grow a backbone. Harry's a horrible jerk until she draws a line in the sand...then he realizes how much he cares and wants her back...have all of us not lived or heard this scenario in some way a zillion times since we began dating? Are we not tired of it yet? Maybe I'm getting old...it's just not very cute or alluring anymore...it was hard for me to sympathize and consequently hard for me to stop rolling my eyes."
5,the frog king a love story,"This book took me by surprise. I don't usually read love stories, but this book was a bit different. It was very detailed and personal. It's about a man Harry Driscoll and his life working in the editorial department of a big publishing house in New York City. It also deals with his relationship with Evie. Harry doesn't seem to handle anything well. He's always late with deadlines for getting things published. He doesn't handle his relationship with Evie too well either. He seems to enjoy upsetting her even though he cares very much for her. He doesn't handle his money well either. He racks up his bills so high that at one point he is left with 19 dollars a week in which to get food.It was interesting to read a story like this from a man's view.I recommend this book to anyone who may wonder what big city life is like. A lot of steamy stuff that I can't mention. You'll just have to read for yourself."
5,interesting and entertaining look at a life,"Davies does an excellent job of taking us through on a journey through the life of a disturbed (yet probably realistic) New York man. The main character seems to stumble around in a haze of drinking and womanizing, all the while realizing he has the woman he wants but can't quite bring himself to be faithful and say those three dreaded words, ""I love you"". The main female character, or the girlfriend of the New York man seems unrealistically tolerant of his discretions, I don't know many woman that would be quite so amenable to that. However the book is entertaining and it provides an interesting look at a man I hope never to have to date."
5,Attention: People who dislike reading a MUST read!!!!!,"I read The Frog King by adam davies and I am NOT a big reader. When I got this book I began reading it and before you knew it I was hooked! I could not put this book down by Adam Davies. The book is about a New Yorker's life and what he goes through everyday being a publisher in New York City. Besides the topic of daily living this book includes daily working, and Sex and Relationships. Now, who can't relate to that! Most everyone can! I certainly did! Its a MUST read kind of Book! So, what are you waiting for? Go get The Frog King by Adam Davies."
1,disappointing,"i was expecting more substance, but i got mostly fluff with this sophomoric effort. the story has some witty moments as do the characters, but there is nothing at the core that remains remotely interesting. it is sad, but i doubt the writer knew much about what real love is at all. a quick read, ok characters, but ultimately disappointing."
3,Looking for love in all the wrong frogs,"I'm completely done with the Bridget-Jonesiness that has invaded every recently-published romantic novel. I just want a love story I can read over a bottle of wine and provides a good cry. I thought this was the book.It's as though Davies couldn't decide whether to write about Harry's love life or Harry's career so he mashed them together and called it a struggle between the two. His love for Evie: Well, yeah, okay. I get it. His need for finials: Yes, haha. I want finials and napkin rings, too, but the desire wasn't developed enough for me to be convinced Harry would risk his love life to get them.It certainly wasn't a bad read (I finished it in one sitting) but it wasn't worth the bottle of wine I drank with it."
1,WARNING: buzz marketers writing reviews for this novel,"Warning: people signed up to do buzz marketing on behalf of Penguin books may have written some of the reviews on here as mentioned in the piece ""The Hidden (in Plain Sight) Persuaders"" in the 12/5/2004 New York Times Magazine. Leave it to marketers to ruin a good thing."
2,A peek inside the process,"Seeing a few of the unrealistically rave reviews of this flawed novel reminds me to remind everyone how tainted the amazon reader review process is. When anyone can review a book there's the chance that the authors publicist, best friend, next-door-neighbor, and even mother can write a glowing review. I'm always suspicious of ""best novel ever"" reviews..."
4,I liked this guy,"When I got this book I was not sure that I would be able to indetify with a 28 year old single guy living in New York. However, as I began to read it, I got hooked. Harry Driscoll, the hero of the story is funny, but also quite human. Sometimes I found myself disliking Harry, but by the end I was totally in love with him.Even if you are not from Harry's ""world"" I would suggest that you read this book. The bottom line is that it is a good piece of writing."
2,"Clever, clever","After reading the author's ""Goodbye Lemon"" I was looking forward to ""Frog Prince,"" said to be his best work. True, I haven't gotten far in Frog Prince, but I find the clever New York smart-guy cliches to be too self-conscious and precious...as though they're the real purpose of the book, not any plot line or insights into character. Maybe I didn't read far enough. I can't."
5,This book makes me feel that life will improve,"A true story of someone's complete downfall, to a slow rise makes one feel as though ""life will be ok"". The main character in this book truly loses it and manages to get his life back from the trenches. I couldn't put this book down - it's a solid read that I read non-stop for a few days until it was done. Sadly that doesn't happen often enough with books today. If you're between 20-40 you will relate to this book. If you live in NYC you will relate to this book. If you are in the book/publishing industry you will relate to this book."
1,I'm going to try to save you [money],"This is one of those books you read and wich you could call up the author afterwards and ask him/her, ""what were you thinking?"" The next call would be to the publisher in a similar vein. I am startled to read the mostly glowing reviews here. Did we read the same book?Frog King reads like a bad TV movie - a bad Lifetime TV movie. I wanted, alternately, to smack the main character and the author. Harry Driscoll is the book. Harry Driscoll is loathsome. In this case, if A = B and A = C, B = C.Of course, I could have gotten it all wrong. If I were you, I wouldn't bother to find out."
2,Fat drunk & stupid -- no way to go through life.,"The hype said this book was about a modern Holden Caulfield.In fact, it's just about a drunk."
1,Save Yourself,"Save your time, money and most importantly your stomach bile by not reading this book. It had the nauseating combination of a boring storyline and unreal dialogue. It seemed to me as I grudgingly turned the pages that this book was simply a vehicle for the author to display his command of pretentious never-used words. I would have honestly prefered to read the dictionary."
1,Not Again,"I have to confess my shock upon picking up this book in the bookstore in realizing that there are people still writing these fantasy New York books. Presumably for people who don't and probably never will ever live in New York City. What nonsense! But that's forgivable considering the immaturity and inanity of poor Harry Driscoll. Re TFK's plot: picking lint out of your navel is a fine activity, just don't write about it. I consider fake books with fake premises, books like these, a crime. Thankfully they're few and far between. I hope we're not witnessing a McInery-Ellis-coked-out 80s surge in boring novels again. Save your time."
1,Threw it across the room.,"The only reason I read through this entire book was that it was the only novel I'd brought with me to a place where no books in English were readily available. Yes, the writing is elegant, even beautiful. But the plot and the thoroughly unredeemable character of Harry were depressing and somehow degrading to wade through.It's a shame. It had the set up of everything I'd like--words, publishing, engaging characters, NYC. Instead I swore every time I turned a page and I did actually pitch the ting across the room in disgust when I finished it."
3,king of pain,"The writing here is good, that's undeniable. Having said that, some of the dialogue is so annoyingly faux-clever and unrealistic. And the narrator is one of the most unsympathetic characters I'm ever had the misery to read about. He's a whiny, materialistic, philandering, immature guy, and when he gets moments of clarity (he learns to cook!) we're supposed to applaud him and redeem his horrendous behavior throughout the rest of the book. For cool angsty tales of New York City, stick with Bright Lights, Big City or Slaves of New York."
3,Frog's Legs,"The Frog King is a very quick read that any twenty-something who works hard, gets paid squat, and is a little self-centered can enjoy. The problem is that the protagonist, twenty-eight year old burnout Harry Driscoll, doesn't even begin to develop symapthetic emotions until 300 pages in. It is a love story in the sense that Harry believes he is in love, yet does not give one example, other than selfish ones, for his emotional state. Rather than feel that we grow and symapthize with Harry, we are instead frustrated at his inability to care for anyone else's happiness but his own. A fast read, Davies' words flow easily and he does have some interesting observations to make, especially about the publishing industry that he worked in. The Frog King goes down easily, but does not quite satisfy. I am curious to see what Davies does next."
1,A frog,"This boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl-but-finds-himself story has been told a million times. But here, it's done with overinflated, made up words--think A Clockwork Orange but not as effective--and completely inane characters. This is a bad beach read impersonating as literature, and to say otherwise misleads anyone who might buy it. Please skip..I wish I had."
4,Charming chandelier,Love the greens in these earrings. Folks always compliment me on them. The weight is fine. Great price.
5,Interviewing Techniques,"I was drawn to this book because it was short and easy to read. I've purchased a few other books in preparation for an upcoming interview, and I found that this was easier to skim through, because I was able to find what I was looking for without much effort. I am applying for pharmacy school soon, and my interview will play a large part in determining if I'm accepted. I can use all the help I can get, and I think this book has given me a great headstart!"
5,Nice and fresh,Amazon stopped selling these for awhile. I just received my order and am quite pleased. These are very fresh and tasty. I'm glad I ordered them.
5,Larry still rocks...,"Larry still keeps you rolling again and again. One of the best ""Larry's"" to date."
1,Beware: Tye Dye,"If you are buying the tye dye version. beware...the colors are NOTHING like the ones pictured. they are like sherbet colors! yuck.i was expecting BRIGHT REDS, BLUES and YELLOWS.but what i got was a mess of pale green and pink.Disappointed, but i still use them seeing as though i paid for them. But my skates look stupid w/ them on."
3,OK but only light duty.,"These guards are great to reduce the moisture on blades but they are very light duty, and offer little protection against bumps and nicks in blades, if you have any metal objects in your pack."
5,I like the red ones.,"These fit just like they should on my ccm size 9 hockey skates, nuff said. Ps I got the red ones."
5,I would buy it again!,"I bought the black terry cloth soakers for my Jackson skates size 5. I use my soakers to wipe my blades and storage purposes. I've been using these covers for 4 months now and are still in good condition. They developed little fuzzies (not like the ball fuzz on clothes) all over the sock, which I don't mind since I bought black. With black clothes, I can hardly notice the fuzz. I would buy soakers again because they protect my blades from rusting, a figure skater's nightmare."
5,Blade covers,These blade covers are exactly what I was looking for. They fit my daughter's skates perfectly (women's size 7 skate). Great price and excellent quality!
2,A tragically over-looked story...,"The thinly veiled story of 'Genie' the '70s L.A. Wild Child, Mockingbird Don't Sing discards the more poignant elements of the story for tacky made-for-TV sentiment (this is at its worst in the 'Lifetime network-esque' attempt to explain why the little girl was abused in the manner as she was found). It's unfortunate that 'Genie' has gone the way of the more intriquing characters in tabloid obscurity. The once hauntingly beautiful mute who inspired such stories as 'Nell' and 'Wildflower' now resides in a nursing home forgotten by the public and professionals who at one time hailed her as a miracle. If you're truly interested in her story, avoid this pricey DVD and go read one of the numerous books on the subject. Hopefully, Hollywood will eventually get some apt minds behind this story and produce a better film."
1,"I second ""What Happened"" ???",I too LOVED this hairspray and wouldn't use anything else - even bought it on-line when I couldn't find it in stores. Then they changed the formula and TOTALLY wrecked it! The smell is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE and makes my hair feel terrible. What were they thinking? They wrecked a GREAT product. PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK!!!
5,Best hairspray ever!,"Fabulous hairspray! Great hold, not too stiff, adds some body, and unlike any other I have ever tried. I have 5 cans in my closet so I never run out!"
4,Another one bites the dust........,"1.RATING IS FOR THE 'OLD' PRODUCT: LOVE, LOVE, LOVED IT. BUT ------2.But as I get on to order... I am struck by these reviews and did not know the one and only product I've ever found to work on my sparse, baby-fine hair, is no longer as it was.It dulled my hair, sooo I used a shine spray... Otherwise, it truly was the only hair product I've EVER found that enabled a great style for me.I will indeed be finding the web site and letting them know I need my excellent original product. Why do companies (and producers ;) always have to mess with the fine thing that worked to start with."
1,New formulation disappointing,this new formulation with caffiene is disappointing. it smells terrible. will not buy this product ever again.
1,Smells terrible!!!,"Don't be fooled, this new Cell-u-plex product smells awfull. Why oh why did they change a good thing??? These other reviews are for the old Thicker Fuller Hair Weightless Vol Hairspry which is fantastic. Send complaints to this co. if you can find there email address."
5,excellent product,I love this product. It holds my hair in place all day no matter what the weather. I have soft hair that lies flat. This product gives fullness and body to the hair. It also easily brushes out at the end of the day.
3,Got some issues,"This thing was stolen from me (not because it was a pen, but because it was in some luggage I lost) and frankly I had forgotten I owned it until Amazon harassed me about it.Well.Fingerprint prone, irritating ""ribbed"" finish, all in all, a ball point pen. I suggest the $10 steel Parker with a brushed finish: smooth, small, light, no irritating fingerprints, no parts that mess with your fingers whilst writing. I lost that one at a job interview. Damn!It may be your thing, I wouldn't know, pens are subjective. Again, I suggest the $10 parker (Jotter), or maybe the $15 one with gold trim that's pretty much the same."
4,"""I said LUNCH, not LAUNCH!""","Normally, when I was in school and my classmates spoke enthusiastically about something, I wanted to stay away from it. But I decided to break this rule and watch ""Far Out Space Nuts,"" and I'm glad. This was the best of Krofft's later shows, and had some genuine talent both in front of the camera (Bob Denver and Chuck McCann) and behind it (veteran comedy writer Earle Doud and the same Chuck McCann created the show and wrote many of its episodes). A fun show that's still worth watching."
3,The tv show that inspired Star Wars!,"George Lucas (yes that Lucas) was a visitor to the set of FOSN in 1975 and got, for one, Chewbacca's look from the frosty creature in the FOSN opning credits. Chuck McCann reported in a book how his show inspired many of the characters in lUcas's megahit SW. As for the series acting well Bob Denver was honestly a little better as Gilligan and Dusty and Maynard G. Krebbs than here as Junior. He is not quite as involved in FOSN as he was in his previous shows. But McCann is in top form as the other lost astronaut. Very funny bits in the series specially in one ep when MccAnn reads a comic book (trust me)."
1,Untimely delivery,"After ordering The DVD, I was sent an email saying it would arrive up tp fourteen days later when I will not be at this address. Not conducive practice lNor will it encourage me to order again."
4,Another Piece of the Pie,"This second season of ""Pie in the Sky is as delightful as the first. However, a little less emphasis is placed on food and more time is devoted to crime-solving. One episode is unexpectedly dark and gritty. Richard Griffiths is perfectly cast as the chef/detective and Maggy Steed is in fine form as Mrs.Crabbe."
5,Love that Pie!!!!,This show has everything to allow you to sit at home and escape to another world of mystery and suspense.
2,Disappointed!,"I am totally disappointed with BIAS Peak LE 5! These people may make the high end music editing software - or have I just heard advertising? - but this product for amateurs is completely frustrating. First, the manufacturers are paranoid and set up all sorts of protocol for you to input and register your copy so they're satisfied you're not stealing it. Then, I find it has all of the high-end options listed on the pull-downs - but GRAYED OUT! And these are the first things on the lists! It's like they are taunting you that you bought the low end version and they just can't let it go. THEN, you have to download an extra fix in order to make mp3 files - only the most useful compressed music file - with another round of hyperparanoid product registration. AND THEN - after all that the software is buggy! I have had an endless stream of problems where things don't work, or they work one day and not the next. Rueful advice: get something else instead."
2,the about self protection,"very dated by decades,. Some information into the psyche of the criminal which known no era.The bold, aggressive and fearless current criminals are far more brutally dangerous. As someone who works in the State Prisons, surprising that anyone is safe.An updated version for 2010 is needed."
5,An excellent book for anyone concerned about their safety.,"There is not a single volume on this subject that I am aware of that addresses this broad subject so well. Ayoob is not only an expert in his topic, he is a great writer as well. He brings the information to the reader in a easy-to-read style. The book is segmented nicely, allowing the reader to go directly to the information that he or she is searching for. The book can be read section by section over a period of weeks without losing meaning. What is particularly eye-opening about this work is how Ayoob shatters many prevalent views, showing how foolish they would be. In particular, Ayoob is acutely attuned to the legal ramifications (both criminal and civil liability) that need to be understood by anyone who is taking measures to protect themselves. Recommended without reservations."
3,Dated. Could desperately used a revision.,"There is some useful information, but I hate paying the price of a new book for info that is 20 years old. There are more updated books out there on self-protection. I would suggest buying a used copy somewhere."
2,its a little out of date,Once you have read in the gravest extreme you pretty much have read this one as well. I respect Mr ayoob's opinion But I don't agree with everything he says I think you would be better served with col jeff cooper or wiley clapp
2,Outdated,"I bought this book along with several other books on security like ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Home Security"", ""Street Smarts..."" and ""All thumbs Guide.."". I haven't noticed what was the publication date, the book is outdated. I have two major cons: 1. information on electronic security systems is very limited. 2. too lenghty and wordy. It's difficult to find the important points. On a positive note I must add that book does cover a lot of aspects of security if you have time to read through it."
2,NOT totally the truth,Some outdated material and biased product opinions from a reserve / part-time cop from a very small town in NH.An outstanding author of gun reviews in magazines.
4,"Lovely Basket , Poor Delivery Time","This basket was purchased as a gift for a grieving family. I'm sure the basket was beautiful although we did not see it ourselves. I paid for expedited delivery so that it could be received within days of the funeral. However, it did not arrive until one week later, the same delivery time as regular rates - that was disappointing."
3,Exposed on the cliffs of the heart,"This music requires that I open my heart to hear it. I haven't done this yet, but I'm aware of the need, and expect a very sensitive reward."
4,Sure...the music is beautiful...,"....but what kind of ... are you smoking to get ""a soundscape of icy brittleness in the piano's higher registers, a geography frozen in time, as if by falling snow?""However, ""the figurative, vibrant sounds of a sparkling body of gases"" about sums it up! Plop plop fizz fizz anyone?"
5,Empowering!,"This set of CD's is empowering to caretakers in that it provides the critical information needed to anticipate and care for someone with Alzheimers. While it is difficult to learn about the progression of this devastating disease, knowing what to expect helps one to plan and therein provide the loving care that is so critical to their family member."
3,Decent stands for the price,"I just needed stands to get 12"" speakers off the ground, and didn't want to pay for heavy-duty poles as the stands will not be travelling. These work fine, but the old adage holds true - you get what you pay for. I would not feel comfortable with anything north of 65 or 70 pounds on these stands. I also would not purchase these if you plan to move them around a lot. They are not gigging stands, in my opinion.However, for a practice space, or set stage set up, they'll work fine."
4,Speaker stands: They do what they should,"Out of the box, these stands assemble quickly. We use them mostly at outdoor events with JBL 515XTs, but many use them inside at dances, speaking engagements, etc. Make sure you expand the base so that it is wider than the speaker, and you don't use speakers weighing more than 120 pounds. These instructions are included with the stands. Overall, a solid buy for the price.They arrived a day or two earlier than expected. A nice plus."
4,Sweetly derivative,"Ok, so they sound A LOT like Belle & Sebastian. But how can you hold that against a band this endearing? They're Swedish, for crying out loud! The album contains a pleasant mix of upbeat twee-pop and midtempo melancholia, and there are also at least a couple of songs that I could also picture becoming mix tape classics-- ""Scent of You"", in particular. I would especially recommend this to people for whom ""Tigermilk"" is their favorite B&S album, as I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by both the similarities and the differences."
5,Music to make you travel in your dreams,"Baden Powel always impressed me by the way he plays the guitar. It is classic, although at the same time very passionate. Every time I listen to any of his performances, I feel transported to a magical world where my imagination fly free and happy, and most of all; in profound peace!"
5,"Works great, doesn't get in the way","I bought this TC to go with my 70-200/2.8. I needed something with some more reach in medium light situations on my DX body (D90). The 70-200 w/TC is still very sharp. Occasionally, if the focus is on the wrong end, it hunts a bit. Focus with the TC is a bit slower than without, but not by much. In those very few situations where this matters, I roughly pre-focus with the 70-200's excellent focus ring.Overall, I am very happy with the 70-200 & TC combo. As an added bonus, the TC17 also works great with my 105/2.8 AFS micro. This lens is slower focusing to begin with, and I don't notice any significant slowing down of focus or reduction in IQ with this combo for portraiture and other medium distance work. Some reduction in quality at far distances/infinity, but a great combo in macro work."
4,Excellent results,The TC-17E II is a nice way to add additional reach to a 70-200 2.8 vr.I can see not loss in image quality with the teleconverter in place and even when using a D80 the autofocus does not seem to slow or hunt more than usual.
5,Give you extra reach for less money!,I bought this lens back in December 2010. Amazon had it for $309.00 so I jumped on the deal as it was the last one they had in stock. Now I see it selling for over $500! I think at this point if I was to do it again I would probably go with the TC-20e III (not VERSION II) as it gives you more reach (340mm vs 400mm) though you sacrifice another .5 stop to f5.6 from f4.8 on the 1.7TC. Though at the time I purchased mine the version II on the TC-20e was out and that one was not sharp hence why they updated it to III.The image quality is superb - I am never disappointed with the quality/sharpness/color of the shots when using this teleconverter. It doesn't take up that much space in your bag and again when you need more than 200mm just slap this on and you are at 340mm f4.8!
2,Be carefull wheb buying a Nikon teleconverter,I purchased a Nikon d7000. I have two lens 18 - 105 mm and 55 - 300. When tryed to purchase a Nikon teleconverter I eventually found out that my lens do not work with any of thier telecoverters. In fact very few AF-S lens work with a teleconverter.So be carefull and make sure the teleconverter you buy will work for you.
2,Common Sense,"For those who really have no idea how things work as far as negotiations and arbitration it's a pretty good book. It's also a good history lesson to the game from a contract and monetary standpoint. Otherwise, for those who feel like they have a general understanding of arbitration and how to negotiate just about anything, I don't feel you're going to get much out of this book. It's written well enough, but the information in the book isn't anything past common sense for the most part. I gave it the 2 stars just because I felt that if someone who has no idea of what goes on what-so-ever would benefit from reading this book and because of the history lesson."
3,Don't be a hater Roger jus cause you ain't makin big bucks,"I think that Roger can't get over the fact that other people in the world are getting paid more than himself. What probably pisses him off even more is that it is a job (playing baseball) that he believes not to be worthy enough of such pay. He is a jealous and judgemental author who has nothing better to do then hate on well known athletes that succeed his pay check. His facts are good though, and he makes a good case. His book is just his opinion though which I disagree with which is basically the reason I ddin't enjoy reading it."
3,Alright,I suggest watching if u have time but it's not really to exciting or funny but if u can buy it cheap go for it.
1,"The book has a lot of good in it, but...","The reason I am giving this a low rating is because the authors have changed their views. The statement on their web site was laughable, its sad how far people can fall."
1,Faulty Logic,"This book starts on a very unstable foundations, by stating that Fertility Awareness is not a form of birth control, even though by their own definition, and Websters it is.The rest of the book is hard to process for me. I can't get over their faulty definition of Birth Control and move past it.If you want an open unbiased look at Birth Control from the ""Christian (which includes catholic)"" view point I highly recommend ""Birth Control For Christians"" by Jennel William Paris which talks about all methods of birth control, including Natural Family Planning, and their moral implications, and specific scriptural issue with the methods."
1,Couple's story invalidates their book,"The reader may be interested in knowing that the Torodes divorced in 2009, had two unplanned pregnancies while nursing, and no longer preach their ""natural"" methods. Mr. Torode, in a profile in the New York Times in 2011, said, ""I am out of the business of trying to tell people what they should do. I am out of that business for good."" Of the unplanned pregnancies, Ms. Pachin (her maiden name) wrote, ""It was nothing I would ever want anyone else to have to experience.""So if you need to be told how to live your life, look elsewhere. For a good dose of hypocrisy, read this book."
2,food for thought,"""It is now quite lawful for a Catholic woman to avoid pregnancy by a resort to mathematics, though she is still forbidden to resort to physics and chemistry.""Mencken, H. L. (1880 - 1956), Notebooks, ""Minority Report""."
1,Reactionary and dangerous,"This is nothing less than a program for the propagation of STDs and misery, wrapped in reactionary religious dogma. Beware!"
5,Robomow creates free time for the family.,"The Robomower is stress-reducing and creates more free time for our family. My husband and I have a toddler and he loves to watch the robomower. It has become a new family activity for the weekends. Now that the seasons have changed we have to go look at the mower in the garage. I have arthritis which means my husband has to do a lot of extra chores like vacuuming, the robomower has really helped us out by allowing him to use his energy on those other chores. Now we just want them to build a RoboVacuum."
5,SCTV was great--this was just as good!,"Those with any gray matter in the '70s and '80s adored SCTV, and this loving tribute to one of the five funniest series ever on TV is sure to thrill and amuse anyone who loved the show. Dave Thomas, we love ya, and thanks to all of you great SCTV cast members--John Candy, Rick Moranis, Joe Flathery, Catherine O'Hara, Tony Rosato, Eugene Levy, and all the rest--who will live in our hearts and minds forever. This is definitely a must-read, written by someone who was actually there, unlike the SNL tell-alls. Hey...why hasn't there been an SCTV reunion???"
2,Disappointing,"I felt this book was missing the overall essense of what SCTV was all about. Few anecdotes on how characters were created and developed. Not all of the SCTV cast participated, which was a letdown.Unfortunately, I stopped reading after 3/4 of the way through."
3,It's ok,"The cab doesn't stay on all that well, but it's not a major downer. It has handle underneath the tail for ""flying"" it around. My 4 year old daughter was pretty happy with it."
5,Great for AP english,"My daughter used this to supplement her reading material for AP english. She read the books for her test, which requires 5 books to be read over the summer. We decided to get her the spark notes to help cement nuances about the material. She did very well on the test, which possibly had more to do with the amount that she studied, but the spark notes certainly didn't hurt either."
4,Pretty good!,"I attended a party over the Xmas break and a friend of mine had this playing later in the evening when everybody was already well lubed and ready for jazz.I was truly intrigued by several of the pieces and had to go out and buy it to enjoy it moreso when i'm not distracted by others talking and I was in more of a condition to appreciate it. :-)Its the first time i've come across one of these albums and ""I LIKE"".Give it a listen. Its interesting."
1,inappropriate for young readers,"i bought this book for a third grader. i wanted to preview the book before giving it to the student. upon reading the first two chapters, there were many words and phrases that i though were bad for a young child to read.Example: ""i wanted to cuss him""... ""darn it""...""jerk""I would not recommend this book for young readers."
4,Dirt Bike Racer,I rate this book a four because the author used very good desciption. He tells what the people look like. He tells about the bibes the bikers ride. What their bike engin is. He tells how many bikes race in a heat. He talks about the track a lot. He did not make him be the best or the worst. He did good sometimes and he did bad sometimes. i think there should of been a little more information in one area. I recomend this book to a seventh-eighth grade student. I recomend this book to a seventh-eighth grade reading student because he talks about things that a younger kid would not know about. This is a very good book to read.
3,Wesley's Review of Dirt Bike Racer,There were a motorcycle down in a lake .They went diving in the lake to find it.When it fell in it was on a houseboat then went to the bottom of the lake. The boys took it home and fixed it up.They got it running.They ran it on.
3,Dirtbike Racer,"Dirt Bike Racer is about a young man whos name is Ron and one day Ron and his friend Tony went scuba diving underwater, Well ron happen to see a dirtbike underwater in the lake.So him and his buddy pulled it out from the lake and took a look at it. It was going to need some work done to it and he was going to need money.So then ron meets some blind old man named Mr.Perkins. Mr.Perkins gave ron a job so that he can fix up his dirt bike.Do you want to know more.... Read the dirt bike racer by Matt Christopher. I encourage many people to read it.Its an exciting and thrilling book!"
5,Actioning Sustainabililty,A terrific compilation of contemporary Australian thinking about actioning sustainability. Essential reading for all those involved with transforming organisations around sustainability principles.
4,First Passover,"The Concise Family Seder by Rabbi Alfred J. Kolatch is an excellent guide for your first Passover observance or for anyone who is looking for a short, straight-forward, Passover Haggadah. That is the view of this conversion candidate.It is relatively brief, comprising less than 50 pages. It guides you through the ritual with helpful explanatory commentary and weaves the story of the Jewish people from Abraham to Moses and from slavery to triumph. I particularly appreciated the author's kindness in including English transliteration and English translation with virtually every Hebrew language passage.I recommend this book to anyone looking for a simple, yet deeply meaningful, Passover Seder.Shalom, Rod"
4,A good concise traditional Seder Haggadah,"This is 48 pages instead of Kolatch's more traditional 100 pages. Its good for an Abbreviated seder. English readings with a smattering of Hebrew text, reserved for the blessings. The FOUR QUESTIONS are in Hebrew text with English translation and English transliteration. Also the FOUR QUESTIONS are in the form of a responsive reading. Dayenu is in abbreviated form and transliterated, too. The Grace After Meals is abbreviated. Includes Chad Gadya and Echad Mi Yodeah (Who Knows One)"
5,A staple at our seders,As our extended family grows we need more Haggadahs so for our seder of 45 this year we bought more of our favorites.
1,mindless ghoulishness,"I bought the book because I am interested in detective logic. The questions that fascinate me above all is: how did the police discover the culprit? where did the ""perfect crime"" fail?Unfortunately, the authors are not interested in such an intellectual who-done-it pursuit but primarily in the horrible details of the crimes, in the ""psychology"" of the criminal, and in historical trivia.It's a pity that three writers should waste their time, and mine, wallowing in ghoulishness.Don't bother with the book."
1,Cliff Notes,Each musing (chapter) gets only a few pages. It reduces some of his ideas to no more than: wouldn't this be nice? with no suggestions to make it happen. I was hoping the book would be more like Jim Wallis' Faith Works.
2,Less useful than it first appears,"The beginning of this book is full of great information--stretching, basic blocks, stances, kicks, etc.HOWEVER, this book is based on WTF (sport) style Tae Kwon Do. I study ITF (traditional) style Tae Kwon Do, so I found the bulk of this book's information, such as the Tae Guek forms and WTF style rules, to be useless. If you study sport TKD or WTF style, this book might be useful.If you study Traditional TKD/ITF style, don't waste your time or money. There are better choices out there."
5,Great Reference,"I have been studying Tae Kwon Do for over a year. I have read this book and my master also uses it in school for students to reference when studying forms. This book is great value to someone who is studying Tae Kwon Do and wants to be able to have a reference point of some sort. I find it extremly helpfull in my training, but do not suggest it to anyone who is not training formaly in the art of TKD."
4,Covers the basics. Supplement to instructor-lead training.,"Explains, with photographs and descriptins, the basics of warm-ups, stretches, punches, kicks, etc. Has a very good section on the Taeguk forms, but makes absolutley no mention of Palgwe forms. That's kind of dissapointing. Look for sections on sparring and bits of self-defense techniques. The small but essential chapter called ""The Philosophy of TaeKwonDo"" should be moved to the front of the book, but at least it's here. There are also a couple of fantastic sections relating to Korean terminology. A chapter in TaeKwonDo history should have been included in this book. This is one of the better reference books on WTF TaeKwonDo, with tons of pictures, but nothing replaces real training in a real TaeKwonDo school."
3,Good reference,It is a good starting reference for those beginning about the sport. The pictures of the poomse are helpful but nothing takes the place of good instruction. I found it hard to rely on the pictures to do the forms.
5,Wonderful help for a student at any Level!,"This book clearly explains Tae Kwon Do in an easy to follow format from history to present, kicking to punching, blocking to stances, and forms to refereeing. If you're looking for a book to help with any of these or just looking to broaden your Martial Arts knowlege this is the one for you!"
5,as advertised,"I spent a lot of time researching humidifiers, and did not want something that was going to be an eyesore, be loud or simple not work. This product fits the bill. It's very quiet, the only noise that it makes it a quick dripping sound - but not the kind that drives you crazy. It was very easy to set up, through the instructions are in broken English so it takes a minute to figure out the meaning. I am easily able to add a few drops of essential oil and the room is quickly filled with a soothing scent. The lights are a nice feature, and can really help to set the tone in a room. And I greatly appreciate the remote, it can sit right by my bed, making it easy to turn on and off the product.The main purpose of the product, the humidify the room, worked perfectly. I am able to create a cool, humid room in very little time. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,Not what I expected.,"I bought two of this item - the silver heart shaped prayer box necklace - for Chrismas presents. While the heart pendant itself was pretty, it just didn't look right to me on the necklace it comes with. The chain is beautiful but a brighter silver than then antique look of the pendant. So it just didn't seem to match. I ended up returning both necklaces. In my opinion, a better purchase for half the price from this same company is the sterling silver small oxidized ""filigree heart"" pendant. I bought that for myself and love it."
1,Bigger than it looks and not very good,"If you're tight on dashboard space you might be tempted to get this radio. Think again. The bulk of the radio is contained all within the box you'll be holding in your hand. This makes for a much bigger handset than you might think. That and it tends to get pretty warm, enough that it's uncomfortable to hold for very long. And if all this wasn't bad enough, it's functioning as a CB radio isn't very good. It has neither good reception or transmission. You won't hear anything at any appreciable distance, nor they you.Overall? Skip this radio, it's just not very good."
1,piece of crap,volume knob broken out of the box. antenna is terrible. reception and transmit are terrible. got better range and reception with two cheap frs handhelds inside the car. do not buy this you will be disappointed.
3,Cobra 76XTR CB Radio,"Ok let's start by comparing oranges with oranges... for a cb radio it is not bad, but remember it is a band of frequencies that are used by truckers that are using FAR MORE power that what is coming out of this poor unit, 4 watts. CB's have always been ment for short range commnuications, while FRS is also ment for that purpose they are using higher frequncies and a difffernet modulation The modulation ,FM, alone means that you will have a better commnuication platform, than the AM modulation in the CB's. So really for what it is... it is OK."
2,Snail Paced Shipping,"If you are ordering from Amazon, make sure they have Mikasa in stock and can ship from an Amazon distribution center. Mikasa products are beautiful, but I will never order anything shipping directly from Mikasa again. It took almost two weeks to recieve my items. They claim that it leaves their warehouse in 1-2 business days; but it was more like 5-7 business days. Happy shopping!"
3,The mighty Goliath must fight to save his throne.,"After the wars, Goliath must fight a sea monster and amazons only to find his kingdom has been taken over by a usurper who throws Goliath into his valley where Goliath must fight his Giants. This video is filled with non-stop action as the mighty Goliath overcomes numerous challenges to get back his throne."
4,Not a price guide,Great for getting in to the history of marbles and identifying certain marbles but very little info on value. Great pictures and examples of marbles but if youre looking for a price guide this isnt it.
4,Nice Book,Very nice book. We didn't find the particular marbles we were looking for but this book has great pictures and lots of info.
1,Don't buy this piece of junk,"The first unit I bought in February skipped constantly when just playing DVDs, it was replaced. The second unit is now 6 months old (and out of the 90 day warranty) and the DVD tray will not even open although messages still appear saying ""loading"", ""reading"", ""no disc"". Neither the remote nor the machine buttons work. Even when it did record, strange pauses kept appearing on the recorded disks. I have used it 20 times to record and about 10 times to play a DVD and it is now worthless"
1,QUITE THE RIPOFF!! DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH GO VIDEO!!,Paid $349.00 for this on the Home Shopping Network and thought I had gotten a bargain - UGH!! - Warranty only good for 90 Days from Go Video and after changing batteries several times because of slow opening and closing it stopped working altogether - this was of course just after the 90 days!! When I called Go Video they said I could send it back for repair at a cost of $75.00 plus my cost to ship and they would extend the warranty for another 30 days thereafter - BIG DEAL!! So now I have a useless piece of junk that I will probably try and have repaired - can't see spending another hundred dollars to have the same thing happen over again - What a Ripoff!! GO Video? No Way!!
1,The DVD recorder that disappoints...,I had high expectations for this recorder. Archive my family VHS tapes and share with family and friends. I recorded my first tape 8 times using three diffrent mfg. media - none would play in any other DVD player. I returned it back to QVC today and got a refund. Don't consider this unit...
1,Don't buy this masterpiece piece of junk,"Sometimes works only with DVD+RW, never reuse the same DVD+RW are only for one use"
1,FRUSTRATION + JUNK,"Heard good things about GO VIDEO, so i bought it. Nothing but JUNK - wasted a whole weekend trying to figure out the Disc+R.recorded on the media and upon loading says ""NO DISC"". even if the disc was loaded. I returned the discs and bought memorex compatible +R. still the same problem after recording.Display does not work while recording. PBC ? what is it no mention of it in the manual. it is just a button on th eremote.I will never buy this piece of crap again. stick to Pioneer, Panasonic or Sony."
5,"""Amazingly Simple To Implement With Captivating Reading""","This is the first book that I have FULLY read in my life!I have read numerous ""parts"" of many books, but Bart's book captured my attention from beginning to end.It is extremely easy reading, and draws you into the text with carefully placed words and phrases throughout. I have started to implement changes into my own business and personal life using Bart's techniques.[...]Move over Anthony Robbins, Bart Baggett is the new boy on the block!I can't wait till I get news of Bart's new books, or programs, as I'll be buying them all... without a doubt!"
3,I does a good job,"Well, it may not be very accurate but it gives a good idea about your pitch speed.It's great for the price but if you want accuracy then go for the radar gun which is not cheap."
3,Amusing Series,While this series wasn't groundbreaking by any means it was a funny and enjoyable series.
5,My dad wrote this book,"My father, Tom McCartney, wrote ""Precision Perspective Drawing"" as a college textbook when I was 10 years old (it was originally published in 1963). There are five kids in my family and we all had to take turns proofreading the mathematical equations at the end of the book with him (talk about a fun way for a kid to spend a day!) The thing that's amazing about this book and my dad is that he never went to college himself, although he wrote a college textbook for engineering students and went on to invent a machine that drew in 3 dimensions long before computers hit the scene. He was an amazing and unbelievably intelligent man, 6'7"" tall, who died at the age of 43 of a massive heart attack. I'm 53 years old now myself but I'm thrilled to see his book still for sale and still of interest to people. He'd be overwhelmed if he were alive to see what an impact his life made on so many. My dad was cool."
5,"Love this, and wheels too!","I had purchased one of these last year at this time. I really liked it but my husband and I both use it. When we watch a movie together we have to share or one does without. I purchased this one last month and it has WHEELS under it. I love it. The other one is hard to scoot over the rug so this one is so much better. The cover has a good lift assist and it is durable.There is no chemical smell either. It looks great in any decor as brown kind of matches a lot. The frame is sturdy. We have used the other one to sit on and some of us are bigger than others, if you get my drift. I wish the other one had wheels now. Maybe I'll buy some and put them on."
1,BEFORE YOU BUY THIS BOOK...,read the first chapter for free on the pearl's website. do a search for -no greater joy-. You will find the pearl's site and you can read the first chapter of their book by clicking -what is to train up a child-. I read the first chapter and it made my stomach turn to hear suggestions of hitting babies on their bare legs so they learn that mommy means business. there are many parenting resources that are biblically-based but do not advocate these abusive treatments. please consider buying another book.
1,Sick people,The authors of this book deserve to be jailed for publishing this trash. The discipline they describe is illegal and beyond abuse. How any person with half a brain could believe this garbage is beyond me.
1,Remove this book,"Amazon, remove this book! The author is using your site to promote child abuse. At least one death has resulted. Isn't that enough?"
1,"This is a book on how to abuse a child, NOT on how to train up a child!","The book, ""To train up a child"" is in fact NOT a book on how to properly bring up a child and ""train them up"" so that they will become mature and responsible adults, but rather it is a book on how to abuse and eventually bring about the DEATH of a child!Michael and Debi Pearl should be arrested and locked up where they can do no further harm if this is the way their minds really work! The content in this book shows that both of these individuals are very sick, very dangerous, and very mentally ill people!!!"
1,Another child dead . . . .,"Another child has died because her parents believed in the nonsense in this book. Love your children, don't beat them with hoses. Google Hana Williams Ethiopian adoptee."
2,author is definitely a sadist,"if one would like to raise violent, S&M; children then definitely raise them on the instruction of this book.personally, i find the author rather boorish if they haven't the time to spend with their progeny, giving them unlimited, unconditional love. good luck trying to raise a caring, loving human being using these principles."
1,Shame on Amazon for selling this Child Torture Handbook,"If you haven't read it already, please read this article from the November 7, 2011 New York Times about the evil this book has inspired. Real kids have died because of this thinking.Amazon: Shame on you for selling this. Now that you know, if you keep selling it, blood will be on your hands.Here is the link: [...]"
4,Read your Bible....The truth is there!,This book has really changed our family and although at first it seems cruel because we are in a society that has strayed so far from the truth that the truth actually seems wrong. But pray and read the scriptures along with this book and the Holy Spirit will reveal the truth if you truly seek it.I have not found a scripture to support (or not support) the appropriate age at which to spank your children. So I recommend starting at the age that you feel God wants you too. I could never spank my 4 month old but at about 8 months it seems to begin to be helpful but I always did it very lightly on the hand not the thigh or leg.
1,What A Horrible Thing To Have Out There For Parents To Read,Unbelievable that this book can even be published with all the evil contained in it. The author tries to use the Bible as a basis for their OPINIONS on bringing up children. It seems these people think it's ok to beat your children and mentally abuse them. Don't support them by even buying it!
1,Child Abuse - pure and simple,"The authors of this book are carefully couching child abuse under the guise of ""Godly Parenting"" and are justifying their methods through misinterpretation of the scriptures. Parents seeking to raise their children in a true Christian manner should read ""Christian Parenting"" by Dr. William Sears."
1,Abominable!!! 1 star only because I could not give it a 0!!!,I cannot believe that anyone who truly loves their child would follow such beastly 'training' methods such as the Pearls!! It is horrific and nauseating. *DO NOT* buy this book! Child abuse is ILLEGAL yet it's being sold in a step by step manual! I'm appalled that Amazon even sells this filth! Disgusting and heartbreaking. :(
1,TO TRAIN UP A CHILD,THESE AUTHORS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSE AND FEED PEOPLE. THEY ADVOCATE ABUSE!!!!!!!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. IT IS A PRODUCT WRITTEN BY IGNORANT PEOPLE FOR IGNORANT PEOPLE!
1,loathsome swill,"Barnes & Noble no longer sells this book. Amazon should do likewise. This book advocates child abuse. Several children whose parents have followed the advice in this book have been killed by their parents. The Pearls are complicit in these deaths, but will never be punished. The least we can do is to deny them the profits they make from this garbage. BTW, they also believe in wife-beating. Nice folks."
1,This book has been implicated for inciting the torture/murder of two children in California,"I encourage AMAZON to discontinue selling any book that encourages a form of discipline that may have led to the torture and murder of two young children in N. California. While the primary responsibility lies with the parents who did this heinous crime to their young children, I think it's in poor taste and also irresponsible to continue publishing and selling this book. Alternatively, all proceeds from the sell of this book should be donated to a child abuse prevention program or to the surviving abuse victims of the Schatz family. Just my opinion."
1,What a terrible idea,"This is an awful, stupid, unchristian, unloving, un-parental book. If I could un-read it I would. Save yourself the time."
5,Common since Biblical parenting guide,"This is a very compact, practical guide for Christian parenting. The only reason someone would not like it is if they were against corporal punishment. Michael and Debi Pearl have ""raised five children with none of them ever rebelling against our authority."" (p.31) How many parents can say that? Has some interesting stories in it as well.2008 - since writing this I would like to edit to say, use common sense and throw out the bones. And make sure that grace and love are at the center of your parenting, even if using corporal punishment."
4,Every parent should read this book.,"Some of the views in this book you may find extreme, but you take what you want and leave what you don't. If you think spanking is wrong, don't buy it. But if you want your children to be a blessing, and not a burden, and you do believe in spanking, this book and the ""No Greater Joy"" 1,2,3 are wonderful. This book will teach you how NOT to spank in anger, and get instant obedience. Huge difference in my kids:)"
1,To Train up a Child,"I was appalled at seeing this rated with 5 stars. This book is an excuse for child abuse just waiting to happen, ""...Select the size of the switch based on the size of the child"". Of course the children will behave - they are beaten into submission (like a horse or donkey) and thus have no other choice. This book was offensive to me and to the other moms in my children's playgroup and I do NOT recommend it to anyone!"
1,Total shame,"This book should be removed from the shelves. I can't believe anyone in todays world, especially if you slightly call yourself Christian, would go by this book.Mine was thrown in the trash. I simply can not believe the advice given in this wretched book. I honestly wonder if the authors 5 children obey him out of fear.I know several families who have taken this book to the extreme and I've witnessed 1st hand at the fear the (older) children have of their father(s). It's heart breaking. It's all I can do to keep from calling our local DHR to check into the welfare of these children."
1,disgusting,"...If you are a caring parent, do not even bother to borrow this from the library, you will be appalled."
1,Pathetic book,I wouldn't even rate this book a 1. My mouth is still hanging open after reading it. I am completely appalled that anyone would think the advice (and I use the term loosely) presented in this book is anything but child abuse. Potty training a 3 month old is the most ridiculous and absurd thing I have ever heard in my entire life. Hitting an infant with a 'rod' while tempting them with a toy is positively reprehensible. Don't waste a nickel on this pathetic book. I am so angry that Amazon or ANY bookstore would even want to associate themselves with the authors of this book.
1,why oh why,"Those who assume there is one way of disciplining a child are simply wrong. Each child is different, and needs to be treated as such. My brother is an example of how this book's principle DOES NOT work. He simply rebels more than ever now. Use your head when disciplining a child. While spanking may work for one, it may damage another. Some people have posted that because everyone does not follow what this book teaches, that is the reason for the shape of the society today. Boy are they WRONG! Disciplining is different than abuse. This book goes too far and teaches ABUSE!"
1,This makes me physically ill...,There is NOTHING sane about these ideas. This made me physically ill--my stomach hurt and I felt so saddened for all the beautiful little children and babies who are treated in such a manner. Their spirits are being broken. It angers me that some people will read this book and take it as gospel truth and actually do these things. I am also upset that amazon.com has raving reviews of it at the beginning and that you have to read way down to see that many people are sickened by this book.
1,How to torture your child into submission,"There is a special place in Hell reserved for these ""authors"". This is nothing more than a child abuse manual. Children have died from the teachings of these sociopaths. If you value your children, burn this book!"
1,A manual for child abuse,"This book advocates child abuse under the guise of ""biblical"" parenting. The Pearls explain how to beat infants with lengths of plumber's line in a way that stings but leaves no bruises, how to set up situations where the child will ""disobey"" so that the parent can demonstrate (through force) that the parent can exercise complete control over the child, etc. People who applied these methods to adults would be jailed for assault. And the Pearl's teaching have led to several children being literally beaten to death; these cases can easily be found with a Google search."
1,Child abuse,This book advocates child abuse. If ANYBODY tried to hit my 4 month old....I cannot even describe what I'd do. Neither God nor Jesus want you to do this to your children.
1,"Horrible advice, avoid at all costs","Horrible advice, avoid at all costs.Yet another child has been murdered by their parents by using the ideas in this book.[...]"
1,Thanks Amazon!!,"What a brilliant idea!! Teach crazy people to torture and murder children!But whatever makes you money. Huh, Amazon? Pretty sad..."
1,When did a child and a dog become equal?,There isn't much to say except following this book is child abuse according to the LAW. This isn't a matter of opinion but it's a matter of the law. If you wanted a dog...get a dog. A baby is NOT a dog.
1,Really Need A Zero Star Rating,"I decided to be fair and read this book before forming an opinion. I honestly hoped that people were wrong and it was just being blown out of proportion.Needless to say, I couldn't make it through the whole thing and walked away with tears in my eyes. This is such a horrible book and anyone who truly loves their children would never even consider the things they suggest in it.This book honestly scared me knowing people like this have children. Horrible horrible book!!"
5,Amazing Book!!,This is the best child training book I ever read!!!! It is a must read for anyone who wants their kids to grow up and be excellent adults that they can be proud of! I struggled with some areas of training my children until I read this book. Now I have such clarity in all areas. Amazing Book!
1,Awful!,"You know what? I was spanked as a kid. You know what else? NEVER was I treated the way the Pearls say to treat your child. I know spanking made me a better person, but those spankings I received were evened out with groundings, long talks on my behavior, what I was feeling, and how we could work together--parent and child--to a more positive outcome. I was never beat, starved, or compared to an animal like in To Train Up A Child. This book should not be sold or promoted in any way."
