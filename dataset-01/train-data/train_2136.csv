2,Book Club,This bood was VERY hard to read. Didn't keep my interest. I would not recommend it unless you like historical reading about Ireland.
1,Finished it grudgingly,"I wanted to quit this book about halfway through, but kept going hoping it would get better. I ended up skipping over the stories within the story. I found the main character hopelessly obsessed and pathetic with trying to track down the elusive storyteller. It was not the historical fiction I was hoping for, especially since, not being from Ireland, I began to feel like every story was a myth, and didn't know if there was any truth to the book at all. I suppose the surprise ending should have helped me feel better about the main character's obsession, but I had guessed the ending about midway through, and felt more depressed for the characters than happy."
5,Audio Adds Extra Enjoyment!,"Never mind the fact that Ireland is a most enjoyable read--the author adds an extra dimension with his reading in this audio version. I could hardly stop listening, after several hours. I'll most likely read the book as well, now that I've listened to Delaney's interpretation. Really a great listening experience!"
4,In Search of the Irish Storyteller,"This highly unusual novel is really a collection of stories. On one level is the story of Ronan, a boy intrigued by an itinerant storyteller, a ""seanachi."" At another level, the storyteller is traveling the entire landscape of Irish myth and history as he mysteriously appears and disappears in Ronan's world. The story frame is clumsy at times, but well worth the richness of the stories, as well as the surprise ending. By the end, I was much better informed of Irish history and how Ireland fits in the modern world."
5,Rich and colorful sage of Ireland,"I listened to this book on CD. Frank Delaney's delivery is exceptional and adds tremendous warmth and reality to the storyteller's stories. I even found myself replaying some tracks, just so I could hear the story again. I really did not want this book to end, so I have resolved to listen to it again within the year.I believe I have found the perfect gift for my Irish friends and family."
5,"Frank Delaney - ""Ireland""","Frank Delaney's ""Ireland"" is part fiction and part fact, an interest to all. ""Ireland"" is a book about the history, myth, and the legend of one of the most beautiful and picturesque places on earth. Through the use of wonderful and interesting characters, mythical short stories, and an outstanding storyline, Mr.Delaney is able to hold your attention throughout this lengthy novel. If Ireland interests you, please take the time to read this outstanding book."
4,"Ireland, A Story","Lovers of history, lovers of stories, lovers of Ireland . . . this book has something for you. Easy to pick up, read for awhile, and then put down until the next break in your busy life. Relaxing before bed reading or great for on an airplane. An easy read with wonderful imagery and a great ending."
3,Ireland,"It was well written , the first story was interesting, but as the book went along ,I found it long and somewhat dull and not engaging."
2,Interesting read but not much of a plot.,I couldn't believe it was sold as a novel not a collection of stories strung together. I read it in Ireland and did find the stories about the places I was interesting. I just was surprised it wasn't really a novel as I look at it.
2,Disappointing,"The book alternate chapters between a boy tracking down a storyteller and the storyteller telling stories or recounting myths of Ireland. Neither story line held any interest for me. I kept expecting substance in each new story, but each myth or legend seem bland. The story of the boy seemed nonsensical. The best part of the book is the language. The writer does write very fluently with a deft use of figures of speech. However, this seems a little off as well. One story the author really brings ancient Ireland alive, but then uses an extended simile of the Titanic. It broke the magic for me.Perhaps I missed the hidden symbolism and meaning, but I gave up after about 1/2 through. I would give the book only one star for the plot, but the writing was very good so I gave it another star."
3,I'm partial to Edward Rutherfurd...,"I found this novel to be somewhat mediocre. Personally, I enjoy Edward Rutherfurd's style of writing (i.e. The Dublin Saga) more. I found the ""main characters"" in this book to be nothing short of annoying--I felt as if Delaney tried so hard to endear Ronan to the reader, only to turn around and ruin it with the temper tantrum thrown by said character. I won't even get started on Ronan's ""mother"", Alison. Beyond that, the folklore and history told made me feel as if I were reading a history book, and if I wanted that feeling, I would have simply read a history book. However, the fact that it was about Ireland held my interest, so I can't bring myself to give it less than three stars."
3,Enjoyed reading this novel.,"This novel captured my interest at the beginning. It is rich with Irish history and tells a good story. It runs on a bit, and I anticipated the end somewhere around the middle of this novel."
5,Most moving book of the year,"I thouroughly enjoyed the book Ireland by Frank Delaney. It was given to me as a gift before our family vacation to Ireland. It's one of those books that educates you and entertains you at the same time. I was so thrilled to finally be in my Ancestorial Country of Ireland, and to be able to see all the places that the stroyteller in the book takes you to. I have recommended this book over and over again. If you have any interest in Ireland and it's History this is the book for you. If you just want a great read with characters that capture your heart this is the book for you. I can't recommend it enough. Thank you Frank Delaney for a great read and an unforgettable experience in Ireland."
2,Star Wars Irish Style,"Meandering cliche story about a boy obsessed with an old homeless dude. Sure. The Irish folk tales are ok. Not worth slogging through Star Wars Irish Style though. It's just been done and done to death. No humor, cardboard characters. Take my advice and pass on this snoozer."
2,good read if you are Irish and in middle school,"Not much flow to this book,with only very limited highlights of Irish history. The motivations of the kid and other adults are rather one dimensional, often acting without logic. It is painfully slow to read, though it does pick up somewhat in the last 100 pages. This was a read for our book and this feeling was universal. Several could not even get through to the end."
2,Boring,"The book is nicely written and it's easy to read, but has a major fault: it lacks of any kind of plot. You may read it as an interesting collection of stories, but then, they are not so great either, and the central plot devised around Ronan O'Mara is the weakest I ever saw. Nothing keeps you coming to the book, wich makes really hard to deal with the almost 600 pages of the novel."
5,A second to every 5 star review!,"What a pleasure to read! I've read quite a few historical novels set in Ireland from the Tuatha De Danann to the Easter Rebellion and nothing put it all together as well as this. And in such a light and interesting way. Reading this book is like examining the facets which make up a beautiful diamond -- you see little minute parts of a history that gradually comes together in a wonderful story. For example, I've read complete novels about the potato famine. The 3 or 4 page story of the the doctor's anquish examing the potato leaves left me with a clearer feeling of the terror of famine than many complete books have done.At first I wasn't sure I was going to like the chapters alternating between ""plot"" and ""story"" but it didn't take too long to begin to see the connection and then I was totally pulled in and found it hard to put the book down. This book is a delight."
3,"Nice stories, unexciting overall plot","I was quite amazed to find how unanimously well received ""Ireland"" has been by Amazon reviewers. I was unable to finish it. I did enjoy the stories themselves, especially some of the earlier ones. But the plot involving the story of Ronan O`Hara and his family and Ronan`s search for the Storyteller did not make for a great read on its own. As such, about half of the book is full of original, compelling, informative stories in beautiful Irish settings. The other half, however, is a far less engrossing coming of age type story with somewhat stereotypical characters and somewhat predictable plotline and events, and thus limited emotional impact."
3,The War in Georgia,"The book starts out when Shanta's aunt and cousin, Honey move out. She is left alone with her Grandmother and her Uncle Louie,because her parents died when she was little. When the Wallings move to the neighborhood, she knows what's it like to have friends that are more like family, because they help her through rough times when she needs someone to talk to. I thought this book was okay, but it was boring in parts. I really don't know if I would recommend it or not. So, if you want to read this book go to the nearest library and check it out."
2,boring,"i bought the sequel to table for two before I actually read that one. I wasn't impressed with either. I personally can't believe that this came from dara. usually her work is so taylored, funny, romantic... this was not of the above. it just seemed forced to me."
5,A timely and excellent analysis.,This is one of the more thoughtful books I have read in this field with careful and precise analysis. Highly recommended.
5,Excellent ASCE/TCLEE Contribution to this field,"This monograph provides an integrated view of risk management to lifeline systems which include transportation, telecommunications, energy, and other vital support systems. The monograph develops tools for understanding and developing appropriate mitigative strategies. It also examines what can be done once damage occurs to minimize damage and disruption. All sections of this monograph are balanced and well developed. Interesting treatment of uncertainties and stochastic analysis."
3,A well done first effort,"This debut album by the Moon Festival, headed by brothers Salim and Faris Nourallah, is a well done first effort, the seeds of much more mature work to follow. It's an interesting looking into their budding talents that have since blossomed into true brilliance, with their 1999 album, The Nourallah Brothers, and their later solo work. Salim, the main writer, frontman, and singer for the Moon Festival, in particular has since given us 3 top notch albums, Polaroid, Beautiful Noise, and Snowing in My Heart, all 5 star CD's, along with his EP, A Way To Your Heart, and his live in the studio album, Pleasantry Lane. I'd recommend The Nourallah Brothers and Salim's solo work first, but Shrine is an interesting addition to the collection, along with The Moon Festival's later work."
2,"Comfortable, but fall apart,...","These are very low priced, compared to other medical sox. Theirproblem is they loosen up after wearing and washing only 3 or 4 times. My Dad wore three pairs out and I bought him more. I triedthem too. Altogether, we wore out about 2 dozen. They are verycomfortable. Maybe, they would be better with a tighter knit."
2,bad,"This game sucks. Trust me, It's bad. There aren't alot of options or people to play as(6,to be exact). There's only 6 places to play and there all basically the same. And the loading time is 17 seconds. That's 2x as slow as thps 2. And everytime you want to restart it or watch the replay or whatever, it still takes 17 sec."
1,This game is the worst game ever.,Don`t wast your mony on this game unles you want to watch sum cool vidieos
5,Folders,These are the typical folders I have been buying for years. They work great for larger files that you may have
1,unwatchable,"I have to wonder why one would make a movie about the man who shot John Lennon. Seriously. Who cares about this piece of crap? But, I gave it a shot hoping to see a good performance from Leto. What a horrible movie. Completely unwatchable. The thing I kept asking myself, before hitting fastforward was, 'Why SHOULD I care?' The director/writer never convinced me that I should unless the allusions to catcher in the rye was all he had up his sleeve???"
5,The final chapter,Acting is exceptional. The transformation of the actor playing Chapman from the beginning to the end is very realistic and extremely disturbing. The viewer can feel the pain he is enduring and while you don't sympathize with him you can appreciate how one's mind can be very fragile. An extremely credible account by a wonderful cast of actors who capture the importance of the novel Catcher in the Rye in the events that unfold.
3,A creepy and unforgettable performance,"If you're a fan of good acting and character studies, this films for you. I'm a true crime fan and read ""Let me take you down""Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman,the Man Who Killed John Lennonsome 10 years ago. Reading it then made me feel that this book could make a very good film. Thankfully, the film turned very good. Jared Leto IS Chapman. He is creepy, menacing, disturbed, lost, eveything that you might expect someone like Chapman to be, Jared Leto captures that essence of a man ready to come crumbling down. For me, this is a powerful film that I believe should be watch."
3,May Mark David Chapman,"BURN IN HELL FOREVER AND EVER. It make no sense what he did, what he did was horrible. Although this film is not to blame nor the actors within it. I just had to say that once."
2,"First time I ordered is was excellent, second time it was bitter and weak","I have ordered this item twice and gotten two totally different results from it. The first time I bought it I was so happy with how strong the garlic flavor was balanced with the smokey flavor. The second time I ordered it, I had a totally different experience, NOT a good flavor at all! The second batch was bitter with an overwhelming artificial smoke flavor and almost NO garlic flavor. I was very disappointed and will not order this item again."
1,You get what you paid for,"My parents had just bought this set of 8 dvds. Now granted, there is a LOT on here.... but it's not good quality.I've got the cartoon disc on right now, and it's all off colored, skipping, with really bad quality. It looks like someone taped them off tv and then transferred them to dvd.Or maybe the production value was just really that bad.It's all public domain, so you're getting exactly what you paid for. The only good thing on this disc is the original Rudolph cartoon, and even that seems like it could have gotten a better treatment.If you want good cartoons, stick with the ones you know. The stop motion Rudolph, Charlie Brown, and The Grinch will be the ones your kids want. Not this."
3,Sounds better than it is,"It's not that this is a terrible video for it is not. It is a good one....sort of. Most of the cartoons were so depressing, I didn't feel like it was the Christmas season. All I wanted to do was go to sleep when it was finally over! The shows were fine, but not as pleasant as that other videos I bought that day!"
1,seeds packet or baggie?,"I was quite shocked to see my purchase arrive in a mini ziploc baggie of 15 seeds with a sticker label wrapped in bubble wrap. The invoice was used to roll it together and taped together rendering it useless when I cut it open to see the item. I was colllecting seed packets as a gift for a friend with a new greenhouse and this is not suitable to be included. It is something I expect from ebay or craigslist, but not amazon."
5,LA VERDADERA FUENTE DE VIDA,"Este libro me ayudo a centrar mi atencion en la FUENTE DE VIDA: La Magna y Topoderosa Presencia Yo Soy, no son los cristales, las novenas, los bustos de Santos, es el Fuego sagrado que arde en cada uno de nuestros corazones lo que nos da la Liberaciòn. El maestro Saint Germain nos regala este bello libro para la realizacion (y no la conceptualizacion),de tan bella palabras, hacerlas reales en cada una de nuestras vidas, porque solamente atraves de la Practica lograremos nuestra CONFIANZA."
5,Transmisiones radiales,"Es aquí donde aparece transcrita una de las famosas transmisiones radiales que en los años 30 los Maestros Ascendidos dirigieran al público norteamericano. Hoy que esto es posible por medio de internet, a través de Serapis Bey Radio, me lleno de júbilo ante la expansión de la Luz.Por eso dice el Maestro Saint Germain en estas páginas: ""la Luz hoy en día los está buscando a ustedes"".Si quieres sentir la Radiación que el Maestro descarga a todos los que constituyen la vanguardia de la Luz, te recomiendo la lectura y estudio de estos Discursos dados a los que ""en un minuto"" responden al Llamado del Maestro."
5,A World Treasure!,"This is my fav Dougie LP...Absolutely brilliant folk music, that happens to come from a Scots man...gorgeous melodies, wonderful lyrics and a great voice to bring it all home!!!What is with the comparisons to James (Coo-Coo) Taylor???- the only similarity perhaps, is they both play accoustic guitars...Dougie is far superior in all aspects of songwriting (and live performances) and one listen to this record will hook you to this guy's music!!..."
5,"Wow, wow, wow!!","I accidentally came upon Dougie Maclean while tuning past our local progressive/alternative music station on my way to finding NPR on the radio. I heard a song which I loved, went to the station's website and searched the playlist. It was Dougie singing Feel So Near. I then listened to excerpts from each of his albums(thank you, Amazon), trying to find my favorite. I purchaced Riof and Essentials. I love, love, love Riof and play it constantly. Simple sounding, yet musically complex with extremely thoughtful lyrics. My favorite is Distant Son, then Stepping Stones, followed by Feel So Near. My other favorite, not on this CD, is Caledonia.Serendipity is everywhere.My father was born in Ireland of Scots-Irish parents. My mother was Scots-Irish Appalachian. I'm tempted to learn Scottish Gaelic.....Italy was the birth place of my husband, and I am only a few generations from Scotland.....both countries so fabulous..."
2,Dougie Needs a Drum...,"Dougie has a wonderful voice; his music is sweet, his lyrics poignant. And, based on a recent NPR interview, I'm sure he's a nice enough guy. But if this CD (my first exposure to him) is indicative of his entire body of work, then Dougie needs to switch FROM decaf. I don't mind getting cerebral and spiritual once in a while, but my bloodpressure dropped so precipitously while listening to this CD that I could feel myself beginning to flatline. Something approaching a tempo would be a welcome addition to at least couple of these songs. Dougie: a little energy, if you please."
2,Sent them back,These have WAY too much iron in them. Since ingesting too much iron increases risk for heart attack and stroke - I sent them back.
3,A little sweet for my taste,"I'm an amateur bassist and blues organist. I heard Labor of Shame on XM and was intrigued by the bass line. So I bought the mp3 album. I liked what I heard in the bass. Some fine lines there. Some tasty chops on the guitar, too. But overall it's a little too sweet for the type of blues that I prefer. Some of the tracks are nice, but there are some that are just...well, cheesy. There's a little bit of an Indigenous flavor to the overall sound, which is good, but I think that this misses the blues mark."
5,"Small Town, Birds, and Family Values","This book tells the heart warming story of Ming, who discoveres her dad isn't dead but instead recently released from prison. McKay reflects on his own experiences in jail, while adding the mandatory bird references. It shares important morals of trust and forgiveness."
5,I can relate!,"This is a great book! Nothing is sugar coated! Its real, raw, and it called the MonSter for a reason! Im mom to a toddler, in my early 30's and recently diagnosed with this disease. I love how these ladies from different lifestyles, different parts of the world and various ages all met and formed a lifelong bond.If you're looking for great real life advice this is the book! I read and I cry, not because im in pain but because I relate and I feel like I know these ladies personally too."
2,Not so much really,"This book is all about women's personal experiences, mostly negative. The only part of the book that was about living BEYOND multiple schlerosis was the last chapter or two. Perhaps I'm just not in the right stage of MS to understand what was going on here. I skipped the chapters about housework and clothing. I can imagine talking to my best girlfiends about that (which the women in this support group were) but I didn't think it made very interesting copy. I also found the some of the in-group terms used, MonSter, froup, flutterbugs, a bit silly and off-putting."
3,Basic Foil,"As Basic Instruction Fencing books go, this one is pretty good. Although..in my opinion you can not learn to fence from a book. My problem is with the cover.....If the book is Basic foil why are the opponents fencing Epee with Saber masks on? Is this an inside joke?"
3,Problems not Correctible,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Wings of Power, WWII Bombers, I purchased this product to use with FS 2004. Immediately two issues arose. First, there is no cockpit in standard view, only in virtual view. Secondly and more disturbing, the P-51 (almost everyone's favorite WWII fighter) is unflyable in all but straight and level flight. As soon as you start maneuvers, it stalls and spins out of control. We certainly would not have won the war this way. And finally, Shockwave apparently has ignored the program as there are no correction patches available for this problem.Don't waste your money!"
1,Look elsewhere for a good game,"This has got to be the worst Playstation game I have ever played. The only thing worse than the pace of the game is the AI. You can score fast break points all game, even after a basket is made. The camera angles are torturous, and the graphics are years behind the standard.The game does have some nice features such as recruiting, polls through the season, and post season tournaments. However, they are all lacking true enjoyment value. The recruiting is clunky, and unlike NCAA '00 Football, you have no idea what your standing is with the recruits you are sending visits to. The polls are ridiculous and don't seem to have any correlation to how your team is actually doing.I cannot recommend anyone buying this game for any reason. Try one of the other college games, or stick with NBA tittles."

1,Stinky shampoo,"This product had spilled all over inside it's bag because there was no inner lid to close it up. The smell was awful, it did not smell like roses in the least, it smelled like an old product! I was very dissapointed."
5,Disturbed Rules,"Disturbed is the best, what can i say. David Draiman outdid himself on this album. I am one of Disturbeds biggest fans. I loved the first album but i like this one better. I never skip one song on this album cause they are all so good. The best songs on this album in my opinion are Prayer, Remember,and Devour. Draiman is a great artist. Prayer is a song about The book of Job and the armageddon and the end of the world as Draiman puts it. I almost wore this cd out already and i've only had it for like 5 months. Keep making albums Disturbed."
4,No sophomore slump for Disturbed,"After ""The Sickness"", I'm not sure if anybody saw this album coming as far as the sound. David's voice really matured between records and it shows in the hits ""Prayer"" and ""Remember"". ""Liberate"", ""Intoxication"", and ""Rise"" are probably the most fast paced and heaviest songs you'll find on this record. One thing that I think probably shocked many people around the world was the closer on this album. ""Darkness"" has such a depressing lyrical meaning to it but at the same time is one of the most beautiful songs written. It gave me goosebumps when he reached the chorus. Very strong record. Although it is a new sound for Disturbed after ""The Sickness"" it proves to be a good change as this sound has stuck with them ever since and has brought them noting but success which is well deserved."
3,improved in some parts but still no surprises in this album,"Disturbed is a great band and talented in their own way but Believe is not bad for a sophomore effort but, all of the middle tracks including the song believe, and rise which sound like songs to fill the album up, of course the album starts off hard with Prayer and Liberate(my favorite), but the songs get slow and pointless except for Remember and Mistress, very good vocal work on those songs, Darkness is also a good song but not enough lyric work on this song which slows it down. slow but a pretty good sophomore effort."
4,Pretty good.,"The first thing i noticed was how Disturbed changed their tone since their first album the Sickness. They seemed to go for the meolidic tone instead of the brutal, head riveting hardness of their previous album. Considering Disturbed came from no where; literally their 2nd album did so as well, no one expected a 2nd from these guys. I guess you have to rock hard and fast to break the underground. Either way Disturbed is an excellent band from the heavy metal genre. If you enjoyed this album, you might also like Green Carnation, Opeth, Superjoint Ritual and Chimaira. Thanks!"
2,Everyone thinks opposite of me on this one.,"So I see everyone deems this album as a huge improvement and a great direction. I respectly but strongly disagree. I think this album was terrible. I gave it two stars because I did like a couple songs from it. I'm so happy they did not continue in this monotone, bland and non-distorted direction. I think this is most definitely their worst album they've done. The lyrics were not bad but the melody was an ear sore. Not sure why they chose this direction but Ten Thousand Fits redeemed this travesty. If you love a power hitter, don't bother with this album. But if you like something toned down and much more radio friendly, then this is your pick. If you get only one Disturbed album, get either Asylum, The Lost Children or The Sickness."
2,two stars for only two songs i liked,"I only liked two songs on this album and thats prayer and liberate the rest i did'nt like, so this was a bad album from them."
4,Disturbed CD,"This CD is excellent! I had only heard a couple of the songs on there when I decided to purchase it. When I received it, I found that it was of good quality and loved it instantly. It's a great CD and band. I recommend it strongly."
2,Distubed rocks-just not this time.,"I love the other disturbed albums-this one though is somthing of a letdown. with the exeption of ""liberate"" its the same tune from begining to end.Not great.I love ten thousand fists though that whole album is teriffic!"
2,MAXIMUM MEDIOCRITY!!!!,"Although ""the sickness"" was an incredible debut album, Disturbed have failed in several areas to create an album worthy of the same praise. While ""The Sickness"" was raw, original, and full of variation, ""Believe"" is merely two or three songs, each one changed slightly and given a different title. The result is a repetitive collection of annoying songs, none of which seem to tap the same ferocity of the debut. I enjoy the majority of Nu Metal albums, and was really let down when ""Believe"" caused me (the irony here is astounding) to lose faith in disturbed. If you have to, buy it, otherwise just get a Korn album and be happy you made the right choice."
4,Way better than The Sickness,"Although I did like the Sickness (the first 5 songs, at least), Believe leaves it dead on the ground. The sound is so much matrued, and the lyrics more meaningful, they sound somewhat like a sadder, modern version of Black Sabbath. This shows great potential. best songs- Prayer, Liberate, Remember, Breathe."
4,Not As good,Not as good as the hardcore cd but it still pretty good. but they shouldnt soundlike a boy band ~nods~ go back to hardcore.
5,Great Talent,"People write reviews on the up rising of rock and how disturbed has a style like metalica and so on. BUT disturbed is a form of pure talent just like any other artist its there own style derived from there own twisted but simple brain. Now this as there other cd was amazing, And thats probably what they were going for amazing nothing less. So in my opinion Disturbed still brings everything you could want in a cd. Style, Lyrics, and most of all a corupt but able Talent of there own."
2,Prayer single (VERY Expanded ver.),"As a Die hard Disturbed fan, I looked forward to Believe for months, (actually well over a year), only to be wholey dissapointed when it came out. Prayer is a classic styled song of Disturbed calibur. Beyond that, the rest of the music is watered down, emotionless ramblings with no particular point or direction. All in all, the music isn't horrid, but Definatly not for a fan who enjoyed the drive/emotion/hard hitting lyrics/musical styles of ""The Sickness"". Sorry, but its true."
1,If your looking for their raw sound of before PASS!,"I fell in love with the bands sound on ""The Sickness"" And while you can still tell it's Disturbed, their edge is gone. It took me five tries, just to sit still long enough to listen to the cd all the way. I understand wanting to write about anger at the death of the grandpa, and 9/11. But if I wanted ballads and inspiration from beginning to end almost, I would have bought John Tesh's new album."
1,Save Your Money,"Save your money. Very disappointing follow-up album. Gone isthe beat that made them my favorite. Why do bands change the formula that made them so sucessful in the first place? I hate to say it, but they have turned into another Staind."
2,Not As Good As The First,"After hearing ""Prayer"" on the radio I thought I had to buy this CD. After I bought it I was so disappointed. All the tracks sound the same except for a few lyrics. Also the songs on this cd have hardley any lyrics in any of the songs! David Draiman's singing is still very good but it is much softer and not as angry. I personaly think Disturbed should keep with the same sound as in ""The Sickness"" it was fun and sounded much better than this."
1,Do not waste your money,this cd really [is bad] the sickness is alot better if you liked the sickness alot and you like that kind of music this cd doesnt have it its not as heavy and not as agressive i wouldent buy it
5,The Man,"The cd is good but not as good as the sickness. It is not as dark as the first and to me not as good. The first 4 songs are pretty good. Number 12 ""Darkness"" is not a very good song, it is the worst on the cd so watch out for it. The Limited Edition version is worth buy with a bounus dvd, leather case, and the logo is metal on it. Looks more like a book than a cd case. Hopes this helps."
1,Changed for the worse,"I'm a big Disturbed fan and I have a lot of respect for David. The point is that this cd sucks. In the first cd, the sounds and guitar work gave Disturbed a dark, creepy edge. That edge is now dull as they shriek about holy topics. The guitar work is now crap and all their dark stuff is no more."
1,another crappy nu metal band,Let me just say this i hate nu metal its crap its uninspired its just a way to cash in on all the other pointless music todaythe songs on here dont have guitar solos they have stupid lyrics and the members of the band look like wierdosMy cousin likes these retards for some odd reason I wish these guys and the rest of these nu metal bands would stop putting out these crappy albums now cause its getting oldso in coclusion i give this group and this album 0 stars for lack of origanality and pointand i hope someone will come along and shut these nu metal morons up and put them in there place
1,keep takin your paxil,"PAXIL MOTIVATED FOOLS WILL FALL FOR THIS CRAP METAL B.S. IF YOUR ROOTS ARE IN METAL AND ROCK OF THE 70S, THIS STUFF IS SERIOSLY SECOND RATE. BUT IF YOU ARE A PAXIL DRIVEN NU ROCK LOVER YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS. THOSE OF US WHO GREW UP ON NUGENT, SABBATH, KISS AND THE LIKE WILL LAUGH OUT LOUD."
4,In ur face rock!,"Disturbed rocks. They have a weird style of music and thats what makes them a little bit cooler than other bands. But dude, The singer seriously needs to lose the stupid chin rings!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Do You Believe?,"Back in the memorable year of '99 I heard a song called ""Stupify"" that was on one of the best CD's I currently own. Songs like ""Voices"", ""Down With the Sickness"", and ""Fear"" completely amazed me. Now Disturbed is back with Believe, a record of some similarity to their debut, but for the most part, a lot has changed. If you already have their debut, then you probably know why I gave this disc such a low rating. Instead of the great, brutal music I've grown to love, they come up with more ""melodic"" songs. The result is tracks that are softer, less anger, and sound alike. The first single and song on the album ""Prayer"" is probably the best of the whole record. While there may be a few other songs that I could consider decent, the majority of this CD is worth passing. Buy the first before even thinking of buying this. It's a lot better."
1,Right.,"Or wrong? Disturbed, is well, pretty wrong. I don't know who they hire to review these albums, but uh, news flash: there is NOTHING intelligent about Disturbed. It's jock nu-metal with childish lyrics. Progression of a nu-metal band? Haha, that almost sounds like an oxymoron. This album tries to be melodic, haaaa...the singer needs to be able to actually sing and the musicians must be able to write melodically to make it melodic, and hey, these guys just don't have the skill or talent to pull that off. The last album was horrible, and so is this one. So, if you're new to Disturbed, or are a fan of their older stuff. Don't buy this junk...move onto something better, something different from overhyped nu-metal garbage like this."
5,"Not as Good as ""Sickness"", But Still an Excellent Disc","When I heard Disturbed's new single ""Prayer"", it totally drew me into buying the new disc. I'm happy I did, because ""Believe"" is a great CD. It's a more melodic-sounding album compared to ""The Sickness"", but despite the change Draiman and Co. still retain that awesome sound that sets them apart from the many posers and stale re-trends that populate nu-metal or aggro-rock today. Tracks like ""Liberate"", ""Remember"" ""Rise"" and ""Mistress"" give the album a smart kind of sound to it. Draiman preaches freedom, struggle and self-preservation in the lyrics, while Dan Donegan adds some really cool riffs on guitar. If you want to hear a more louder, heavier Disturbed pick up ""The Sickness"" but ""Believe"" is an excellent follow-up that brings a toned down kind of sound with it, while still remaining hard and powerful both lyrically and musically throughout the 12 tracks."
3,Watered down,"After I got the first Disturbed CD I had a hard time taking it out of my CD player. It was just one of those rare CD's you find that you can listen to front to back. The new CD ""Believe"" isn't bad, but lacks the real darkness and grind that the ""Sickness"" offered. The guitar licks are still pretty good, but David Draiman sings waaaay to delicately on this one. It seems like he was trying to prove that he has a really nice voice and can sing melodically, which really ruins this CD for me. I liked the raw sound he displayed on the ""Sickness"", he came off sounding genuine and convincingly [...]off, it was a much more powerful CD. Aside from track 1 and 2 the rest of the CD is pretty weak. Maybe it's just the sophmore jinx, hopefully their next CD will get them back to their roots."
3,"Worst CD sound quality, buy mp3 instead","Music 4.5 stars - CD sound quality zero stars. First I thought there is something wrong with my stereo equipment, but I have now premium stuff. This CD is mixed to a quality of 128kbps or below mp3. I saw Disturbed life in San Jose, great performance and sound quality, but again this CD is very very badly mixed."
2,I don't know where to start...,This album is not nearly as loud or as original as their last album. Most of the songs have mediocricy written all over them and can be downright boring to listen to sometimes. It feels like the band lost the originality they once had. I'll stick with The Sickness.
3,"""I command you to rise.""","The first single 'Prayer' comes with a great video (which is on the CD enhancement) which can always give a song more success than it deserves. Although it's a decent rock song, it doesn't measure up to the strength of the earlier releases 'Down With The Sickness' , 'Stupify' and 'Conflict'. Nevertheless, it is a deviation from their normal vocal style and diversity is appreciated.Unfortunately, too many songs on Believe sound like B-songs that never made it onto their debut, The Sickness. Exceptions are the harder hitting 'Liberate', the sweeping 'Remember' (my favourite track) and the unexpectedly placid 'Darkness'.I've always said that a CD's worth buying if there are four solid tracks so i'd have to say ""get it"". Just don't expect what you've heard before and don't anticipate a sore neck as a result of DISTURBED moshing."
3,"I must admit, I'm a little surprised and impressed!!","I have to admit, before listening to this disc, I was not expecting a great deal from it. I think the whole nu-metal, rap-metal genre is completely intolerable. And the first Disturbed disc was repulsive, but was adored by angry 16 year olds all over the world. But this new disc acutally has some decent songs on it. Prayer, Liberate and Remember are pretty enjoyable. And this time around there is a great deal of actual singing going on (wow what a concept these days), rather than grunting, which has become the norm in this genre. So, if your not really sure about this purchase, I say give it a shot. Listen before buying. You may be pleasantly surprised"
4,If only...,"Had this been their first album, I would have been thrilled with it, however, I wasn't overall as happy with this cd, by far. sure I like it, but if I had to choose which one to listen to, I'd pick the Sickness.If you like Disturbed, sure, get it, but don't think it's gonna blow you away, mostly the best songs are the over-played ones from the radio.If you don't have the first one yet, get it first."
3,Hmm...,"I've read some of the reviews left by other members about this album and I share in your opinions. Yes, I was a little disappointed. No, Disturbed has not sold out. Yes, Disturbed has changed.There were few tracks that I felt had the quality present on the first album. You know, the unmistakeable quality that made you listen to a song and automatically love it.I'm not saying I hated Believe: Mistress, Prayer, Liberate--all great songs were fun to listen to...once in a while. The rest were quite repetitive and boring. A change from the sickness' gripping lyrics and unique sound.Though I respect Disturbed for their ability to come up with an album that displayed such growth, I hope the their third disc finds its way back to The Sickness' vibe."
3,Big Slow Down,"Many more slow songs that the first album. Many people say that this shows the incredible talent of their lead singer, but I could really care less. When I put this in my stereo, I expected to get my 12's moving, and the car shaking.... instead I found about 4 songs I like and a bunch that are just WAY TOO SLOW. Oh well, guess thats why I have an MP3 player in my car.... I highly recommend their first album, but this one is iffy."
3,2nd (?) CD,"Mostly good stuff, nice video inlay on the CD. Not as good as CD's 1 and 3. I think they were feeling themselves out on this one."
3,what happened,when i got this cd i thought it would be as good as the sickness but after i had listened to all the songs i realized that it was no where near as good. the lyrics were totally that opposite of the sickness and it wasnt near as heavy. i just didnt like it. i hope the third one will be better.
5,believe,All I can say about this CD as well as their first is OUTSTANDING! Can't wait till their next CD.
4,A little less disturbing...,"I have been a Disturbed fan for going on two years now. I really liked 'The Sickness' and I could listen to the whole CD without skipping a song. Then when I heard the song 'Prayer' on the radio (before 'Believe' came out) and I knew right then and there that this new one would definitely show the world their lighter side. And so, my buddy and I went out and bought it, and our predictions were right. But not in a bad way! No, 'Believe' is an amazing sophomore CD for Disturbed. You really get a chance to hear the more varied vocal talents of Derek Drainman on this CD, instead of the typical 'Down With The Sickness' acidic-throat voice. Yeah, I like it. 'Liberate' is the best song."
1,Great!!!!,"This album is great!!How could you not love such well articulated statements on society with the background of sonic subtlety and brilliance that is delivered on this disc.There is nothing trendy or unoriginal about this wonderful band.Highly recommended!!!The singer might be homosexual, but thats his choice. I wish everyone would quit saying that these guys are hacks and that only an unknowing 12 year old could think they have talent. Its not true. These guys are changing the industry while also mastering all of the most intelligent and insightful styles of our times."
1,They should be working at 7-11,"Are you kidding me? This album is horrible. A lot of the songs sound a like and the fact that they all have one word titles to the song names is annoying too. They're sound is different than other bands, but it doesn't amount to good music. Their only good song period is ""Down With The Sickness"" and what they need to do is change their beats and fill their next album (unless they don't want to record anymore albums which is fine by me) with songs that sound nothing alike whatsoever and diversify the album, if they even know how."
1,Disturbed....sounds like they got sum mental help,Ok so heres how it is. I LOVED DISTURBEDS first album. I couldnt put it down. I loved all the tracks. Concert was great. Everything I loved about them...then this cd came out. What in the world?? Dave did you get all your crazieness out in the first album and decide to turn soft? We really didn't need another Staind. I don't want to be mean...I luv Disturbed best band around. This cd is tottaly diffrent from the first...they took a chance and it didn't work. Should of sticked with the same stuff because thats what us...your fans liked. Keep tryin!
1,Believe it's bad!,"From the faux goth/""satanic"" bling-bling on the Limited Edition packaging to the sheer inanity of their lyrics, Disturbed is indeed that if they feel they are metal. One has the impression that Disturbed is trying to prove something to the unwashed hordes who clamor for their ""music"". What are they trying to prove? That because they have a Limited Edition they have achieved fame? Gimme a break! If one wants real metal, stick to Acid Bath, Apocalyptica or better yet,Pre ""Load"" Metallica."
3,A very repetitive album with a few good songs.,"It's definently a fairly solid cd with a decent amount of good songs, however, the majority of the album is extrememly repetitive and formulatic, meaning all the songs tend to follow the same exact formula. The Sickness is an overall, much better cd then Believe. They both have a different feel though; Believe is a lot more ""softer"".The best songs here are ""Liberate"", ""Remember"", ""Rise"", ""Prayer"" and ""Devour"". All of the other songs aren't really worth a mention in my opinion.I think unless your a big Disturbed fan, you should stay away from this cd and just download the songs I mentioned above."
3,Complete Change,"I've been waiting a long time for this album to come out because ""The Sickness"" was so awesome. However when I bought it i'm very dissapointed. It doesn't have the same ""Disturbed"" feel to it as The Sickness did. It sounds too ordinary and too much like, hate to say it, Metallica :( Sorry Disturbed but i'll never buy another one of your albums till I see the same feeling that I got from your first album. There are however so really good songs on the album but the bad ones outweigh the good ones. My advice..download the mp3s to save yourself some money."
5,Disturbed in a different light!,"Disturbed is great and this ablum makes them greater, every track on this rocks!"
2,Disappointing....,"If you loved ""The Sickness"" because of the great metal sound and the amazing vocal talent that David Draiman showed in songs like Down With The Sickness, The Game, and Stupify, do not buy this CD. The songs are certainly decent, and the band has talent, but compared to ""The Sickness"", this CD is just plain boring. This is not like the first album... this isn't stuff you're going to have cranked up in the car, or stuff that you'll be moshing to at a concert. If you loved the hard, crazy, heavy music from Disturbed's first album, and were expecting more of the same, ""Believe"" will leave you very disappointed. I expected more from the band that gave us the insanely disturbing final verse of Down With The Sickness..."
3,Extremely different from The Sickness,"Well, what can I say? This is a nu-metal album with little direction. The songs are very similar and Draidman's voice here is less than stellar. His voice is not as crisp and the songs follow a nu-metal structure. There is little originality that was present in The Sickness. And after 2 years of owning this, I never come back for it.The good news is, I have the promo for Ten Thousand Fists and it seems like the songs are very catchy and Draidman's voice does shine here. It's still nu-metal but its something I'd much rather listen to. I suppose its just taste, but Disturbed is indeed a unique band with some kind of talent. Let's just consider this a sophomore slump.One more thing, this is a good nu-metal album. If you are into nu-metal this is good. If you are a critic like me, this is not up to spar."
4,Great Sophomore Album,"Hands down, ""Believe"" is an excellent hard rock record that embraces metal influences and makes every song enjoyable (in contrast to their first rap-metal album). Their aren't really any true metal moments, and none of the musicians are off-the-wall extraordinary, but the music fits almost perfectly into a very well crafted album. On this album Disturbed doesn't try to be something they aren't (an industrial/rap-metal band) and the results are pleasing. Highly recommended to fans of hard-rock.Bottom Line: Disturbed puts out a very solid hard rock record with this one with very little of ""The Sickness""'s sound. Just wait until you hear the closer, ""Darkness""!"
4,Not too bad,"To some people this may not be as good as the first CD, The Sickness. But to others, this is a great album that exceeds the first. The songs such as Mistress, Liberate, and some of the others may not be that great. But others such as Darkness, Prayer, and the majority of the other songs are actually pretty good for a second CD."
3,better than first,"I thought this was better than the first. I like alot of the guitar playing in this album. In the first album, David made some funky noises which i thought were funny but weird. I probably will end up buying the first but not for a while. BELIEVE gets a little old after a while but is an excellent album with many great songs."
4,"not as good as ""the sickness""","this is a great album, no doubt about it, but it doesn't display the same energy presented in ""the sickness"".In my personal opinion I have 3 favorites tracks on this CD.1.liberate (I think it is 2 over the top 2 resist)2.believe (My favorite part about this song is the melody)3.prayer (great opening tune)(dude!!!!)overall i was disappointed, but i still love this album!!"
2,not the best,i was really disappoited by this cd i heard some band on hard drive ( a radio show} saying this cd was 10 x 's better then the first on i only like 3 songs on the cd but im still a huge disturbed fan if your going to buy this cd buy it on sale its not worth 20 dollers
5,awsome CD,I think this CD was awsome. vocals and the lyrics were amazing. also to the guy that said that it was a nu band or w/e listen dude music changes is pop music(not that i listen to it jsut an expample) is it the same is at use to be? no i dont think so. so the same way pop changed so did heavy metal and if you dont like the change then why bother reviewing?
4,Another big hit,This has just about as much impact as the first cd. Im wondering if anyone has heard this one song. Disturbed- New Disease>>>????If you heard this song befor..What cd is it on>???
5,Excellent.,The price was excellent and the shipping was quite fast. I was very pleased with the transaction and would do business with that particular seller again.
2,Now a Sissy?,"The sickness was a great album. With hard lyrics and pain wretching sounds made that album successful. They were all hard and mean in the sickness. The first single off this album, prayer was really good. I then liked remember, but the rest of this cd is down right, one word gay. I mean what the hell happend to these guys? I thought they were mean and hard, this cd is all about being nice and being wimps, god i thought i would puke this cd up after i watched opera or something. I guess i just have to listen to the RIP disturbed's sickness cd and buy some old slipknot cds. What the hell happend boys?"
3,what happened to the the Disturbed we all knew and loved?,"I admit, Disturbed's first album, The Sickness was GREAT, though a bit silly. David Draiman's voice can get really annoying when he's singing. His screaming voice is addictive, but he kind of sounds corny and like a little kid when he's singing. This CD, BELIEVE, has a corny name, a corny hit single (prayer) and basically everything else about it is cheap, fake, and corny. Too bad, maybe next time. They certainly have the potential since their first album was so good."
3,not as strong as The Sickness,"I was disappointed by this cd. In my opinion, The Sickness is much better. Believe, with the exception of Prayer, simply doesn't have the catchy songs that the first album did. Unless you are a diehard Disturbed fan, buy a used copy of this cd, because it's not worth full price."
4,awesome album,"Disturbed is defenitley one of the best metal bandsof this decade.The new album is not as heavy asthe first one but it's heavy.I guess they wanted totry and play different styles and expand theirmusical talent and to be more open with differentmusic.Some fans may not like it because it's notheavy enough like the first album.After all you don'twant to sound like your first record any way,why dosomething that you already did.You don't want to copyyour own music but by doing that you have to tryand do something different.That's why I love thisalbum,some fans may think they sold out on us alreadybut you know what I haven't heard or heard about anyonesaying they did.Buy the album Believe now,what are youwaiting for."
4,Great follow up.,"I wish there was a way to give 3 and 1/2 stars instead of 3 or 4. One, because it's too good to deserve a 3 star rating, or an average rating. And two, because it's missing ""something"" that keeps it from being a true 4 star rating, but regardless, I'm giving it 4 stars. It starts with the 1st single prayer with is definitely reminiscent of the Disturbed from their debut cd. But from track 2 on, it takes you on a very different path than the first cd. Now that's not a bad thing, at least to me, but for some of their fans might take a little getting used to. But they have a great sound whether it's the chord crunching eevryone is used to, or the newfound melodical singing, which is good in it's own right. Overall a very good follow up, which like I said, maybe not quite deserving of the 4 star rating I gave it, but close enough."
2,Overrated and Forgettable,"This and Taproot's brainless ""Welcome"" deserve special mention in 2002's most disappointing and overrated albums.What's the connection between Disturbed and Taproot? Well, besides both band's fan bases consisting of America's lower bracket of IQ holders, and all the other t-shirts in their fan's wardrobes besides these band's probably have wrestlers on them, believe it or not, both these bands released albums in 2002 with one word album titles, and one word song names for EVERY SONG on both albums. How stupid is that?"
1,old men trying to play metal,"I saw disturbed on HBO and thus listened to the CD. These guys are as old as dirt. If I had to wait until I was that wrinkly to move out of the trailer park, I too would begin to Stupify."
2,GONE SOFT,"Good Lord.... What happened to ""The Sickness""????? I heard PRAYER on MTV and I wanted to puke. What's all this happy melodic stuff??? Don't come out with a hard heavy first album and then go soft on ur sophomore album. Disturbed sounds not so ""Disturbed"" anymore... And that Disturbed me...."
3,meh.....,"This CD is nothing great. It doesn't even come close to The Sickness. First of all, the CD is much much softer. ""Darkness"" features a cello, and no drums or bass, not something you'd expect from the band that brought you ""Voices"" and ""Stupify"". Believe does have much deeper messages. There are no 'don't beat me mommy' songs. So basically, if you are expecting The Sickness Part 2, don't buy it. Overall I'd say it's a good CD, but nothing spectacular."
1,Not my cup of tea !,"Sorry but I don't like this, always the same distorded guitar, always the same riff, feel like it was the same song from the beginning 'til the end, poorly done !"
2,it wasn't broke!,"'the sickness' remains one of the best hard albums in the last five years. the speed and structure of the songs, along with the lead singer's (his name escapes me) instinctive feel for vocal rhythm blew me away. that said, i have no idea what this band was trying to do with this album. the majority of the songs have deteriorated to slower attempts at melodic rolls. if a song happens to speed up, the lead singer decides to sing slowly! it just doesn't make sense. although there are a few good, hard-hitting reminders of the old disturbed, this album, on the whole,sounds like something system of a down decided to do one afternoon and then got tired of. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone who liked the first album."
4,O Ya. This is another really good CD.,"I'm sorry, but I don't think these guys are in the same category as Sevendust (as another reviewer posted). I like Sevendust, but for my money, these guys have had 3 very strong albums and deserve much credit. I'm not saying 5 stars for any, but 3.5 to 4 stars for all of 'em. I can't say that about many new heavy bands today. This one is my favorite. Some reviewers think it's not as heavy, but I think it's just heavy enough to make it a near masterpiece.I like listening to this music and play Xbox or a racing game on my PC. Have you tried racing to this music? WOW! Isn't that fun?"
5,"IF YOU LIKED THE SICKNESS, YOU WILL LOVE BELIEVE",I loved this download. It didn't take long and the sound quality is supreme. It syncs very well with any music player (I have it on my IPOD now). I truly love this CD and am gonna download 10000 fists and Indestructible in the near future! :)
2,The Last Innocent Hour,"I did not care for this book. I rarely never finish a book, I stay with it, this one did not grab me, and therefore did not finish it."
3,The Last Innocent Hour,"The main reason I read this book is because of the author's last name, which is my family name also. Not a great reason, I know. In any event, it was a fairly derivative novel of a young woman going back home after several years, only to find that troubles from her past are still lurking. Yawn. If you are a fan of this formulaic genre, go for it. I will admit that there were a couple of unexpected turns, but the outcome was just as I imagined it would be."
2,The Last Innocent Hour,"No thank you! Creepy but without much depth, though of course it all ends up happily enough. Plot was rather out of focus."
1,The last innocent hour,"I Just couldn't get into it very well. a book has to catch me immediately, and this one did not."
1,Very predictable,"Plot and characters were extremely simplistic and predictable. Not one character had any depth, they were flat, immature and egocentric. Uninteresting from start to finish."
1,I might sue,"This book says it is for Absolute beginners but introduces technical terms from the word go without explaining them.I wanted a simple introduction but immediately was bogged down with terms I did not understand and detail about specifics which I also didnt understand. Not a good book in my opinion.I might sue this book book, as the title is misleading, under the trade descriptions act."
4,Maxtor External HD,The drive arrived on time and was easy to install on my computer. It has performed well to date - about 1 month.
3,"The David Morales ""Sleaze Mix"" of THE REASON is hot!","Lemme explain. I'm from the school of thought, where, if it ain't broke, don't fix it! The original album is the BOMB! King Britt and his Philly collective put together that funk-soul fusion thats incredible. But this, a reworking of the album, can be best described as experimental. Memorable tracks include the stripped down, R n B remix of THE REASON, track 3, (Play Duplaix Mix). As usual Ms. Viki Miles' vocals sooth. Production team Mood II Swing make a guest appearance on WHEN THE FUNK HITS THE FAN working the echo chamber thang. The mix everyone was talking about, and the one people will be talking about for years to come is David Morales' ""Sleaze Mix"" for THE REASON. What more can I say, than ""You go boy!"" This **** is hot! ""You're the reason that I touch ... the reason that I love you!"" What a combination, David Morales on production, Vicki Miles on the vocals. Listen to that organ work! Now you know why Morales won the grammy."
1,recalled because of lead!,"In July 2007, the California Department of Health announced in a press release that they had conducted testing on Pulparindo candy that showed the candy contained between 0.12ppm (parts per million) and 0.18ppm of lead.I have looked this up in several articles and as far as I can tell, the recall is in effect indefinitely. Please do not give to your kids until you know for sure this candy is lead free! This candy showed up in the trick or treat bag, and I'm glad I googled it!"
1,Not as pleased with these as I had hoped....,"I purchased these along with the chili flavored versions as I grew up eating these types of candies. Unfortunately I have to say that these appeared to be years old and stale, or at least, they felt as though they were old and stale because of their texture and look.Every strip was completely saturated in corn-starch making every candy very very dry and gritty. Unfortunately even rinsing the corn-starch off did not make these palatable and I would have to recommend that folks avoid these, or at the very least select the chili flavored version as they are far more fresh and actually taste like the product I remember having as a child."
1,Pass...,"Really not worth the money I spent on it or the extra I dropped to have it shipped. It was pretty dry, even as a fan and could have been a lot better. Waste of time in my opinion."
5,Great Angra DVD!! all their hits and lots of extras.,"Angra is a realy amazing band. If you know them you sure know what I'm talking about.For those hwo don't know them: Angra is a Brazilian Heavy Metal band with some power metal influences. they are very close to their fans and always sending a positive attitude towards almost everithing.This DVD shows that.. It is true that the edition of the DVD in not the best as it could have been, but with the music, attitude and crowd you just feel like standing in front of the TV and start headbanging for a while ;pAll their Hits are in this DVD except (of course) those from the last two CD's.Lost of extras... includes Angra in Asia, Europe and more.. two Video clips and photos from their REBIRTH world tour.Every Angra fan should have it, and people hwo love Heavy Metal and enjoy to be F'N young and free!! yeah!! Angra is that feeling.Buy it and enjoy it!!"
1,IDK,Never got the DVD so hard to review it. Purchased from MARVELIO LLC and received the wrong product 2xs. I will buy it elsewhere and receive again
4,no more rocking,I spent the first three decades of my life using a Woolworth ironing board that constantly rocked and it was just accepted until Amazon came along and sold everything under the sign just like the old Woolworth. This is a heavier than average ironing board but it is still easy to fold. Think of it as a surfboard and nevermind the extra weight which is negligible to anyone but incurable whiners.
1,The worst,"This is, by far, the worst transaction I've ever had with Amazon. The first board arrived damaged - there was a dent in the mesh board, making the surface uneven. It was a nightmare to return it, since I was not careful to preserve the original packaging and tore it apart. Amazon customer rep, for some reason, decided to order a replacement for me, without ever asking me whether I want it. The second board arrived defective as well - the hook that is supposed to hold the board together so it doesn't open, doesn't work, so the board is always half open and impossible to store. I'm sending it back (after suffering through repackaging again). In addition to the fact that I've received a defective product twice, I have to say that the board is huge and is NOT easy to open. And although it's a wonderful idea to be able to regualte the height, unfortunately, it is not easy to change the lever position. Do not recommend this product."
4,Makes ironing a breeze!,"This ironing board is nice and wide so you don't have to keep moving the clothes. I have always had a cheap ironing board, and a cheap iron, didn't really iron much. Now I love to iron, it's so much better than the wobbly old thing I had before. I also purchased a new iron, spent around $80, a lot of money for me but my gosh what a difference!! It is well worth the money! I should have done it years ago and not had the frustration of a cheap iron and board. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the pad could be a little thicker ( I added an extra layer of pad, which can be picked up at any fabric shop, use the existing pad as a template) but it is still a great deal!"
1,iron holder,"The iron holder did not leave enough room for adding a thick cover. the solution would be to leave at least one inch from the ironing board, or have the iron holder removable. I had to saw the iron holder 0ff to fit a thicker cover. The plug for the iron cord extension is in an awkward place. This information comes from my wife who has been ironing for 53 years. Thank you, and please call me on 239-454-6856 if you need additional information."
1,Be aware of 2 drawbacks,"Alas, after replacing a 40 year old ironing board because of its rusting and worrying about getting rust onto the clothing, I have just noticed 2 things about the year-old Polder replacement: 1.The mesh develops hard bumps under the cover. 2.The mesh is already starting to rust from steam!"
2,poor quality,does not get close enough to hair in order to trim around the edges. Blade was great at first but then got dull as time went by. also nicks and pulls hair on the face. I would recommend getting a clipper with detachable blades with a blade size of 0000 or less that way the trimming and edging is about perfect down to 2mm of hair.
2,You get what you pay for....,This T trimmer feels more like a vibrator. I called Andis and explained what I was looking for in a trimmer and this model was recommended. The trimmer works well with the combs but doesn't seem to give you the crisp outine on your beard.
4,Andis Pivot Pro Trimmer,"good clippers, easy to adjust the blades compared to higher priced clippers, the blades cut great when adjusted right, good overall price."
2,not really as powerful as they claim to be,In my experience I did not get a close shave with these clippers. I was attracted to them because of the price. I would recommend spending a little more money and buying the Andis Professional T - outlining clippers.
3,"nice features, but unreliable","I bought this trimmer two years ago because its short blades allowed me to trim my beard and cut my hair using the comb attachments (at the time it came with 4 combs). It worked as promised, but I have thick curly hair and twice the unit has been lodged with hair rendering it useless. I keep it clean and oil it regularly. I've already replaced the blade once and I did so because it too became clogged. I give it three stars because it worked as promised, just not for very long. I think I'll look for a professional vibrating trimmer."
5,Outstanding,"This book is an outstanding resource for those interested in parent and child treatment, research, or program development. This book has been thoughtfully constructed to include important contextual informtion for understanding emerging pathways to community implementation of various models."
3,A few weaknesses,"My overall impression of the book is positive. However, I would like to mention some of its weaknesses:1) Terminology is at times inadequately explained.2) There is sometimes no clear connection between the definition of a term as explained in the chapter and as given in the glossary.3) Not enough examples of the terms as they would be used in context.What's more, the accompanying teacher's book is not always useful for clarification of the terminology and the adequate examples of the terms in use are sometimes lacking in depth and breadth.Based on these weaknesses, do not rely solely on this book for preparation in proficiency in Legal English!A note to teachers: You will not be able to rely on the teacher's and student's book alone if you wish to be adequately prepared for class!"
1,"I have not received the book on schedule even though it was already charged on credit card. I look back, please.","I have not received the book on schedule even though it was already charged on credit card. I look back, please."
4,The Economy Today,"I bought this book for a college class and I have skimmed through it. The information is all there, its just a matter of you understanding and comprehending what the book is trying to tell you."
3,"Nice box, but it is NOT suede leather","This is a nice box.Since I travel alot, I like the travel bag included. It's roomy and small enough to fit in your purse.Take note of this,the listing states that it is suede leather, but it is not.????"
1,Premium Vehicle Power Charger,Very disappointed. The above product failed to charge my phone even though it was the correct charger for my make and model of phone (Sanyo 8200). I would hesitate purchasing this type of product again.
3,Nice for the money,Exactly was describled. it is thin so be careful. Would have been alot nicer with a better edge. Layered would have been really nice. The edge makes it look a little cheap- but it IS as described & looks good on my guitar. Matches the bars on the Fender Kingman exactly.
2,poor quality,"Dragon Blood is a great movie,however the dvd tranfer is digusting.It has Dutch subtitles that cannot be removed,full screen and very poor picture quality.The same applies to fighting fist of shanghai joe.I guess the 2 stars is for the dvd cover."
3,"Not bad, pretty typical","I do enjoy horror flicks, so I do not have a lot of negative things to day about even the worst of them. This was pretty good. The typical gang having fun and ending up in peril. Not much original there. A couple of fun scenes and good jumps. The photography is great and the scenery is beautiful. Not bad."
3,"Well made Norwegian slasher, but...","Cold Prey couldn't possibly be more derivative. Ain't it Cool News commented that this is ""probably the most perfect slasher movie ever made!"". Well, I might agree if I'd only seen a handful of flicks from the genre. But seriously, this offers absolutely nothing new.This is your basic ""trapped teens stalked by a maniac"" movie, regardless of the claims on the back cover. Beautiful teens, decent kills, brutal bad guy, plus an ending you'll see coming 90 minutes before the end (it's a 97 minute flick). Also, no nudity.Worth a look, I suppose. This has an option for dubbed English dialogue, for you billions of viewers who hate reading subtitles."
1,Acting was Horrible!,Couldn't get past the acting. Watched up to the first kill then turned it off...
3,"Well shot, typical horror film","Cold Prey, aka Fritt vilt, tells the story of a group of friends who go snowboarding down a mountain. The introduction to the movie tells us that there have been a lot of problems in the area. They are in the middle of nowhere, and one of the friends gets hurt. Naturally, they are ill-prepared and must improvise. Upon finding a cabin, this movie turns into a horror film. The setup isn't bad and the film manages to look really good, using the backdrop of the mountains, snow, and interesting camera angles. Unfortunately, the film is pretty short on plot. I felt this one could have been much better, although it is still a fairly impressive piece of work given its likely modest budget."
4,"Honestly, Really Good","I popped this one in not expecting much. More straight to video drek from Starz I thought, formerly known as the once great Anchor Bay. I watched not expecting much, & to my suprise, it just kept getting better & better. This one really & truely is worth watching. This is slasher the way it used to be done... the way that it should be done. Now a quick warning for that certain few that can't get into subtitled films. This is in fact a foreign film & is in fact in a different language. The acting is great, the suspense, the horror, the villain, the blood & guts all done top notch, hats off to the makers of this film. This is a truely spooky flick that has you at the edge of your seat, well worth at least a rental, I was certainly impressed, & I think you will be too. Definately check this one out!!!"
2,Psycho light,"This flick was compared to Descent, which is a great outing into the horror genera. This is nothing like that. The first thing you have to do with this DVD, is to go into the set up menu and turn on the English, and now you have a dialogue spoken in Norwegian with English dubbed in. Hard to watch. Add to that the vocal music and text shown in newspaper articles is all in Norwegian, this leaves an English viewer out of the loop. That behind us, this storyline is standard fare, the actors do a great job, the leading lady is a take charge likable character. In the horror genera, I think the bar has been raised quite a bit above this production. Yes it has it's moments, of suspense, but it doesn't quite make the grade of a modern slasher film. I don't want gore for the sake of gore, such as Saw, but this one seems to go out of the way not to offend anyone. I'm just glad I didn't pay the new release price."
3,Standard slasher fare,"A good looking film set in Norway that entertains in a traditional slasher way, but ads nothing new to the genre. Friends snowboarding find themselves stranded in an abandoned inn, which happens to be the haunt of a psychotic killer. There are a few tense moment, chases, and a kill scene or two that will catch your attention, but nothing particularly memorable (the villain in the end is certainly forgettable). Dialogue is better than average, the scenery is done quite well, and there does seem to be an investment in the quality of the flick. A very worthwhile rental. Should you happen to get turned off by forein films, the dubbed option is really quite good, not at all like the old Godzilla flicks :)"
4,Good atmospheric slasher,"""Cold Prey"".Was a pretty good movie and was beautifully shot and lit but it was not well defined because no real back story was given about the killer.We as an audience were given a scenario that wasn't defined clearly enough to decipher what was or wasn't.At the end of the day it is pretty light on gore.I recently purchased Cold Prey 2 and in that film they made sense of what was not explained in this film.There was a bit of an old school feel to the film and some creepy moments and a couple of good kills but not enough that will satisfy the die hard slasher fan.The battle for survival at the end is the highlight of the film this and the atmosphere are why I give it 4 stars.."
4,"ITS A SLASHER, PLAIN & SIMPLE","Watching this reminds me of the movies ""Scream"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and some other slasher movies. I gave it a 4-star because it still gave me that jerking in my seat when a gruesome scene is playing. Not really scary in a big sense but you still grit your teeth and clench you fist in disgust. Only drawback is the language but nothing like the good old captioning wont fix. Overall an enjoyable movie provided you see it only one time. Its not the kind you would go back to over and over again even if you crave for a scary movie. But still good nontheless."
3,Frostbite is the least of their worries,"Most dubbing is laughable, so I always go with subtitles when watching a foreign film. The characters were more likeable than in most in slashers and I loved the remote location with nothing but snow covered mountains in all directions. The thing that pissed me off the most was that it's promoted as a different type of slasher, but the only things different about it were that it was nearly bloodless, had no nudity and it wasn't made in America. The tension and build up suspense wasn't nearly what I expected either. I was hoping for something along the lines of John Carpenter's The Thing meets Halloween, with a little foreign flavor of The Descent thrown in. Now that would be some movie."
4,Good Thriller,"If you like thrillers with stupid kids its entertaining.This movie has been made 1000 times, but still enjoyable.It would be better in warmer weather with some hot girls."
1,"Streaming version is dubbed, no subtitles","This is just a warning for people like me who despise dubbed foreign films and insist on subtitles. The streaming version of this film is dubbed only, and there's no subtitled version. Amazon doesn't bother to provide this information in the product details for any of their streaming versions of foreign films, and I'm sick of it. You've been warned; you can't get a refund on a streaming rental."
2,Nothing we've haven't seen before,"For a Norwegian horror/slasher movie, this film bears a striking resemblence to its American counterparts of the same genre. There's the tired, familiar premise of a group of hormonal teenagers who are trapped in an isolated location as they are being stalked by a faceless killer. I'm sorry folks, but I've seen these type of films all before. Story be damned, I'd have to say that the acting is pretty solid, especially by the female lead. I was expecting a low budget film, but it seems as if the the filmakers made the most of what they had and it shows. It's a nice-looking film for sure, however it's a familiar one."
2,Yakima fatcat 4,"My fat cat got broken in the highway 70, ruined all the skiis and boards with it last year after using it about 4 months. I liked the design and look on my 4runner but it's not durable to highway speeds with 25 mpg gust winds..."
4,Decent ski carrier with aerodynamic shape,"I had FatCat 4 for 2 years now and no problems.I carry 2 to 4 pairs of skis on a regular basis to Colorado ski resorts on my Acura MDX factory cross bars.I bought it primarily because of its rounded shape and it is completely quiet at highway speeds!4 starts because as with many other Yakima products the design of attachment points feels flimsy, so you need to be very accurate and precise when attaching these carriers to your roof rack and then keep and eye on it during the ski season.I guess the reason they are flimsy is that they accommodate a wide variety of cross bars from different manufacturers."
2,Nothing inspiring.. returned it,"I think this book is aimed more at getting diabetic kids to cook than at cooking for diabetic kids. Since my son (newly diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes) is just 4, he won't be doing to main part of the cooking any time soon.There were no photos of the recipes, and the format (A-Z recipes for each section) was distracting and annoying. The font used in the titles was jarring, and to top it all off, I didn't see one recipe I really wanted to try.I returned this book. There are better ones out there."
5,Ravensburger Rules the World (of puzzles),Purchase this or any other Ravensburger puzzle with confidence. Handled over and over by my three sons -- pieces hold their shape and the image lasts. Even the box it comes in has held up. I plan to put these puzzles together with my grandchildren.
4,Make sure you get a Dongle,"I believe the software is pretty great. I just bought one off ebay, advertised as Ver. 6. In actuality, it was merely an UPGRADE from 5.6, and hence, does not have a Dongle included.The software will not run, without the dongle. So now I am looking everywhere to find one. Lightwave software people will sell me a new dongle for a mere $200. Their own tech dept thought it would only cost about $25. Anyone out there want to sell a good working 5.6 dongle, cheap?"
1,Disappointing,"When the bottle arrived without its cap, I wrote immediately to the vender. They have never replied. I am using it but wish I had the cap. I will never order anything from that vender again."
3,Great Addition for Home and Away,"The components are easy to assemble and set up. You can use headphones (not included) to listen to the reciever. You can also listen via any AM/FM radio. I had no problems getting the system to work with my knowledge of the Sirius Satelite locations and basic FM waves as some did in previous reviews. If you have problems with this you are among the ""problem getting the VCR/VHS to work"" generation. The only thing I did not explore was the range/strength of the reciever to an FM radio: This can make up for the length of the antenna cable. The system is easy to use and a great addition.Thanks"
4,No logo?,The lighter came within a few days and I was very impressed. When I opened it I found it had no zippo name printed on the top like in the photo. It is still a great lighter and works very well.
5,If you're into party games....,then get this one. It's really fun and unique from other party games. The mini games keep you entertained and wanting more. If you're into the Mario Parties games then definitely get this one!
4,Shrek Super Party,"Shrek Super Party was kinda boring at first but once you start playing it gets better. You can play as 6 different people, Shrek, Princess Fiona, Donkey, Lord Farquaad, Thelonius, and Monsieur Hood. Its not like Mario Party at all. All in all, pretty good gameplay."
3,Hard to learn,"It is a fun game, but the mini-games to give you a chance to practice, nor do they give you a reasonable explanation of the game. It game be hilarious at times, but very frustrating at others. Also, 4 players must play at a time, whether they be AI(computer controlled) or real people. The AI characters tend to be very good at the game. I haven't found a way to modify their ability so that my daughter would have a better chance.I am sure that once we do get a good hang of the game, it will be much more enjoyable."
5,not mario party,"This game is awsome. I love it. It is not anything like mario party. First of all you dont have to wait for all the character to move before a mini game, you just have to make the ball land on the mini game space(which is most likely to happen. I give it a thumbs up although it only has six characters it does not matter. AWSOME !!!!!!!!!!!!(...)"
3,Not what I expected,"If you are expecting something like Mario Party, don't buy it........yes, Shrek Super Party is nice but the graphics are terrible, it has few carathers and just 30 games( most are confuse). It can be really fun for those who really, really, really like party games, but really boring for the ones who just want to play a interesting, simple and a good game."
5,Awesum,This is the first Chapter in what I hope will be a long series. The art work is incredible and the storyline is unique for the vampire theme. This graphic novel will surely be collector items for years to come. The storyline is fresh and current. This is one of the best adult graphic novels out there.
3,Unfocused but delicious.,"Frans Mensink, Kristina, Queen of Vampires, vol. 1 (Nantier Beall Minoustchine, 2005)NBM, purveyors of everything from graphic adaptations of Proust to the basest porn, bring the kickoff volume of a series of the latter to American shores. As we open, it's medieval times, and Kristina is hunted down and staked by a band of outraged (yet aroused) peasants and their pet priest. Fast-forward to modern times, when a drug deal gone wrong ends with blood dripping down into Kristina's grave, allowing her to rise again and pick up where she left off hundreds of years ago. The only ones up against her are a pair of randy police officers who spend as much time in bed as they do on the case. Yeah, it's porn, but I have to give Mensink credit for at least trying to thread in something resembling a plot here. Not a bad way to kill a half-hour. ***"
1,Vampires suck,"You know when I bought this book I knew what to expect. SEX, I wasn't looking for much of a storyline or even excellent art work. I gave Kristian: Queen of Vampires (not really since see dosen't command anyone) a try just because I wanted another sexual novel in my collection. This one fails on major levels. The artwor is good I can't say it's not. But the story like the sex which is why I bought this book is rushed and unsastisfying. The sex scenes are way to short and the story..... Come on what story is their honestly she's able to overpower men armed with guns but a few villagers with wooden stakes are a problem for her? <_< Just like many movies and books about vampires, wolfs, etc this is just anothe failure trust me save your money."
2,Disappointed,"Based on the reviews I read, I expected a lot more than what I got. The storyline was very basic, and the dialogue felt rushed for the sake of the sex scenes. That would have been fine if basic porn was what I was after. Also, though the sex scenes were plenty, the illustrations left something to be desired."
2,"I thought this was a book, stupid me.","It wasnt a bad story if you like that kind of stuff. Dont get me wrong I like alittle sex in storys but when a vampire finds that she can get more power from a man's underpants navy insted of blood, it just doesnt make sense. The art was great, very very very graphic but alittle to far for my taste. Like I said I thought this was a book, not a comic book."
5,I Love these too...,I also purchased egg rings that I Love. These poachers also work extremely well. I couldn't be more pleased... You can't beat technology! :)
3,not quite correct,"Really? Am I the only one that the eggs don't ""easily slip out of the cup""? I followed directions using spray oil, vegetable oil, butter, etc., and run the knife/spoon around the cooked egg and they, still, stick to the cups. OK, not a big problem and a relatively easy way to poach eggs, which is why I give it a 3-star, but don't tell me eggs slip out of cup."
1,2 bucks more,So the paperback is 5.99 and the kindle edition is 7.99. Kindle your out of control with your pricing It used to be a good deal to own a kindle but not anymore.
1,this is really funny,"has anyone noticed that all the reviewers that have described it as their favorite KOONTZ book are 1 review reviewers. Every time I click on the reviewer that has rated it as his favorite book has only one review - for this book. It's important that we find accurate reviews by legit reviewers, and not some people who probably get paid for writing reviews in order to falsely praise a book. this should not be allowed on amazon."
2,A book inciting paranoia?,"I had no good feeling in the stomach reading that book. This is entirely a product of the 90ies, with conspiracy theories, the X-Files and JFK intrigues going on... I am not sure if I should think this book is good. It literally incites every reader to literally hate and mistrust anyone related somehow to the government...While I do agree that nothing and nobody is perfect and that abuse of power are a fact, generally denigrating the American government and people working for it doesnt really seem to me the appropriate way to deal with the problem. I wouldnt wonder if some far right milita are using this as their favorite bed time story.The story itself is well writen, the action is good and it's good entertainment. If there werent that extremely anti-government stance, I might have given two stars more."
2,Koontz's Second Chance,"Sorry, Dean. I appreciate what you do for the genre and all, but I just cannot finish a Dean Koontz novel. I got to about page 300, and thankfully someone stole the book while I was in Mexico.I tried to read ""Intensity"" and thought it was lame, but this one was tricky. I liked the main villian, but Spencer Grant and his canine sidekick were too cheezy for my taste. The pacing was off- if this were a quick 300 page paperback, it could have been swell, but drawing out a corny story with cornball charcters is not my idea of time well spent.Sorry, Dean...maybe I'll give you one more strike till you're out (talk about cheez)but I think you are going the way of the dodo bird as far as my world is concerned."
4,Spellbinding...,"Great plot, lots of twists and turns...this book will keep you ""spellbound"". It was hard to put down. The author does a great job of describing his characters and what is taking place. Enjoy!"
5,Intriguingand suspenseful!,"Very fulfilling for me. I enjoy books that combine genres ,especially hi-tech, computers,with a hint of mystery. Koontz motive of having a despairing protagatonist works well here. The main character has a chance to grow thoughout the novel. You can feel the love he has for the lady he tracks across the country. The main villain is an original and I could not wait until he got his. The female counterpoint to the villlain was also interesting. The main character reminded me of the protagonist in Watchers, the book that got me started on Koontz. I would like to see another book with the main characters"
4,I highly recommend this book!,"One note of caution, though - This book is definitely NOT for the paranoid! Koontz has me looking over my shoulder now! ;-)I could barely put this book down. Koontz' style makes you feel as though you are right there with his characters. I also appreciated that he did not take the easy way out and cleanly wrap up every loose end - life doesn't work that way and neither does this book. I could never guess where the story was going - it was full of surprises. I'm hoping for a sequel so that we get to spend more time with Grant and his colleagues in their fascinating world."
2,Action that goes nowhere,"This being my first Koontz book, I approached with the caution necessary whenever I read a mega-selling author such as Koontz, Grisham, or King. The suspicion turned out to be justified. The movement of the novel is sluggish, while the plot turns are ridiculously predictable. I was waiting for some huge realization at the end, some monumental literary zenith that would make the 20 hours spent slogging through this worthwhile, but in the end it was ultimately more of the same: predictable, mainstream, low-brow.Try some Douglas Coupland on for size and give yourself a challenge. I recommend Girlfriend in a Coma."
4,The best part of the book is...,"Eve Jammer's acts of inexhaustible autoeroticism. I bet the author had a good time imagining and writing this!Quite seriously, the author was pretty good in his writing. Problem is, he gets too much with descriptions and metaphors. And regarding Spencer Grant's vague reminiscences of his half-forgotten traumatic past, Dean Koontz is no Dostoevsky. He should have trimmed down on those annoying and recurring inner thoughts and memories of Grant, i.e., those interminable texts in italics."
2,Don't bother,"Koontz has a number of books that are worth reading - but this isn't one of them. His recent tendancy toward sick / erotic side-tales doesn't appeal to me at all, However, it does provide the major source of ""mood"" for the book - so it was probably needed. Move along quickly and don't be tempted to look closer at this one."
2,"Absurdly pretentious, but I couldn't put it down!","From the very first page, I laughed out loud at the incredibly pretentious use of language by the author. The thesaurus on his desk must be huge! But I did find the book very engaging.If there's one thing that can be said for Koontz, it's that he has a sense of pace. The book reads like a screenplay, but I'd have to say I wouldn't see the movie. I enjoyed his paranoid, tortured, conspiracy-theorizing protagonists, transparent though they were, and the truly evil antagonists were oddly appealing as well.Great literature it ain't, but a fun read nonetheless."
2,Conspiracy-based thriller with sicko erotic fantasies,"No doubt about it--this one grabs your attention and whirls you along for quite a ride. The over-long explorations of sick-sick-sick fantasies and the increasingly insistent depiction of conspiracy at the heart of government will doubtless turn on some readers and turn off others. In this context, ""a real page-turner"" meant that I skipped over page after page trying to find actual plot-related narrative."
1,Definitely not one of his best,"I'm normally a fan of Dean Koontz, but I was reallydisappointed with this one. In my opinion thestory went nowhere and ended with nothing resolved.""Dark Rivers of the Heart"" left a bad taste in mymouth. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,I wish it was better,"I'm regreted of buying this book. I still gave it 2 stars because of the begining, which was interesting and thrilling. Only if you are a big fan of Koontz you should buy it. Otherwise, if you 're only curious, just get it borrowed."
1,Another Koontz Conspiracy Fest,"Once again, the big bad government is chasing an Everyman with a gun fetish across the U.S. Obviously, Dean was a big fan of Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST, since he's been mining the plot of that movie for the past decade. But come on Dean! Hitchcock also did PSYCHO and THE BIRDS. A little variety couldn't hurt you either."
5,"A dark and intense thriller, one of the best I've read.","Koontz tells several stories at once, each dealing with a ""river"" within the human heart. One is the love story between the protagonists, Spencer and Ellie. Another is the misguided ""compassion"" that the antagonist Roy Miro exercises on his fellow people. The last deals with a dark river within the heart, hence the title. It deals with the secret of Spencer's past, on a night in July, when he was 14. That story, told in flashbacks, became the most terrifying thing I've ever read once I finished it. I recommend you read this book if you enjoy a love story, a few good chase scenes, or some action sequences that James Cameron would be of. I promise you won't be disappointed."
4,dark rivers of the heart,I read a lot of Dean Knootz and enjoy reading his books. I accually read this book before but still enjoyed reading it again. It is a good thriller without a lot of nonsence.
5,Dean Koontz is a prophet,"Written over 10 years ago, this story is as contemporary as last week.Action packed, will keep you on the edge of your seat (and looking over your shoulder long after you have finished reading it)."
5,Awesome!,"This is the only Dean Koontz book that I have read, and I loved it. The way he pulls you into the story. I have to say that if his other books are as good as this one, he'll soon become one of my favorite authors."
2,"Not bad, but not one of his best","Anyone just getting started with reading Mr. Koontz's books may not want to start with this one. Maybe it's just me, but this one didn't seem to be as interesting as most of his others."
2,A stinker,Ultimately forgettable. Lame characters. Same storyline we've seen in all those shallow government conspiracy tales. Koontz's anti-govt. message was not convincing. One of his worst.
3,There's a novel in here?,"I'm told that somewhere in the midst of this political commentary that Koonz wrote a novel? Really?If there was one, it lacked a clear plot and was hard to pick apart from the pages and pages of ranting about the power of the American government."
2,Not What I Was Looking For . . .,"My mom bought me this organizer when my fiance and I first announced our engagement. I think I'll be buying a different one very soon. First of all, this one's very small, with very little space in which to write. It doesn't pay much attention to detail like you'd expect the ""EVERYTHING"" organizer to do. And it devotes a lot of space to buying the engagement ring, which, frankly, we had already taken care of! Big disappointment."
2,Disappointed,"When I read the good reviews and saw the impressive price, I thought this was the planner for me. However I have found that it lacks spaces to record pertinent information, such as the details of getting a marriage license in your city/state, (or how about a modern/creative idea such as a space to work through one's name change options), yet it has plenty of room for things your average ""down-to-earth"" person doesn't need, such as announcing your wedding in the newspaper. Also, I find the cover to be flimsy - if they'd accept that it's spiral inctead of trying to fake that it's not it would work better and the pockets are really small and flimsy. I haven't yet decided what to do, but sadly I am considering tossing this one and going down to the bookstore to find one I'll be happy with so it may not turn out to be a great buy in the end. Don't get me wrong, tt does have some decent info in it, but so far it doesn't seem to be anything you can't get elsewhere."
3,Not happy with the book!,"I bought this planner for the reason that on the front cover it said ""Calendars"" so I figured there was calendars inside. Upon reviewing the book at home, I found that there was no calendars inside at all! Also, there is only room to write in guest names for 100 people. My guest list includes more than that! Another thing is, the space they give you to write in is pretty small. I much prefer my Weddingbells Planner to this one, and feel that spending $24.00 Canadian was a waste of money!"
5,Wonderful!,"This planner was never out of reach while planning my wedding. Today, I'm sending it as an engagement gift. It's an excellent resource and really breaks the wedding process into manageable pieces. Thanks to this planner, I never felt overwhelmed and had no last minute ""surprises"". The only drawback was the inability to store forms in this book. However, the book is small enough to put in a purse, so the benefits and liabilities cancel each other out. There is also an ""Everything Baby Organizer"" by the same publisher...But that's a separate review!"
2,This planner is not so great,This planner is not that good. Basically it only has places for your final vendor choices. I want one that I write information in and deceide later. For example the catering section should have spots to list more than one caterer. What fool would go to one caterer and sign? This is a shop around kind of event. A calendar for appointments would also be nice. The size is good and you could take it places with you but what use would it be?
3,"OK, but not very practical","This book tells you what needs to be done, but it doesn't always speak to realistic brides with a real-life budget."
2,Everything and the kitchen sink,"Most brides know what they want for a wedding even before the soon to be groom asks them to marry them. This book contains a lot of information and you need to sift through questionnaires and worksheets to get to the good stuff. If you have chosen reputable vendors they will do a good part of the work for you. They will ask you the necessary questions in order to give you want you want because they know what a psycho bride can be like. The best part of the book is the end where they give you a timeline and space to write down the names, addresses, and phone numbers of your contacts."
3,Organizing a wedding,The eighth edition of Bridal Bargains was a much better book. This one could use a makeover and an update. Short on practicalities.
2,shallow,"This book has alot of ""feel good"" inserted in it.I was disappointed in it. I bought it to give to my daughters and daughter-in-law, but changed my mind when I read it.It strayed from the Biblical view."
5,"The how of ""Entertainment Rigging""","Harry Donovan is no longer with us but his book is a testament to his greatness as a show rigger; the safest in the industry and this book reveals in detail exactly how, why, when, where, and with whom of the rigging process. This is not a movie riggers guide but it can give you the basics for all safe rigging. It is worth it at twice the cost."
4,"Product was wrong, but the right one is great","The picture on Amazon was of two products together. I wanted the larger one and thought maybe they would send both, but they shipped only the smaller one. There was no way to pick one over the other in the system, so one would assume what they show is what you got. That isn't true.After contacting the manufacturer, they sent me another... another small one. So I tried again with the manufacturer and finally got the right product the third time.All credits were made properly by all parties, although it required a few phone calls and e-mails to make sure I got my shipping covered too."
5,Terrific playing & recording from a neglected master,"This is a great pairing of two late-Romantic composers. Strauss & Elgar were good friends, and admired each others' work, so this is an appropriate coupling. Steinberg has a very 'heart-on-sleeve' approach that works surprisingly well in Elgar (we Brits think that 'outsiders' can't master the English idiom, but that's totally untrue!); we feel the affection that Elgar had for his friends.Steinberg's Rosenkavalier Suite is very well-balanced (there's no 'official' suite, though Strauss sanctioned several versions in his life-time, and Leinsdorf did one for Decca Phase 4 in the 60's, though I've never come across that on CD). Don Juan has bags of swagger and pathos at the end.Steinberg was less well-known in the UK than he should have been, and I have always admired his music-making. Any fellow-Steinbergians out there?"
2,For Children and Hardcore Fans,"Like the film it is based on, this ani-manga will not convert anyone who is not already a fan. And it frustrates many fans with its careless exploitation of a previously rather well-designed series. Buy it for your kids, or if you simply MUST have every YGO item out there. Otherwise leave it alone."
5,Very Nice!,"These items were a gift for my fiancee. They arrived at my house well packaged, and in good shape. They are beautiful, and look like they will last many years.The cost, including shipping, was reasonable, the quality is excellent, and I am looking forward to purchasing their Nativity Set for next year. I will be doing business with this company again."
5,115gifts,"Last year I ordered 2 sets of ornaments for my grandchildren to place on the tree as the Nativity story was read. I was so pleased with the quality of the ornaments that I ordered 119 ornaments this year. I was responsiblle for Christmas favors for a large group of women. I've had nothing but positive comments (and probably more orders for these ornaments) from those who received one. Two ornaments were cracked, but I'd ordered a few extras so it wasn't a problem."
5,Makes you want to climb on board,"This CD was recorded live aboard the 1897 schooner ""Wawona"". The songs on this CD are done with such energy and feeling that you can almost smell the salt air. There are fighting songs ,""Follow Me Up to Carlow"", that makes you want to enlist. Sea shanties, ""Roll Down"", ""One More Pull"", that make you want to sign on. Drinking songs, ""Whiskey in the Jar"", and a couple of touching numbers such as ""Fields of Athenry"", and ""Leave Her, Johnny"", and a traditional song like ""House Carpenter"". Included in the selections on this CD is ""Barrett's Privateers"" a good sea song from the late and great Stan Rogers. This group's blending of voice and instrument makes for over an hour of enjoyable entertainment. Just set the sails crab the tiller and sail away."
1,Lost in Digital Translation,Coloring the B&W original has been contested with all film classics from the past. I accepted this colored format change when I purchased the film. What I didn't bargain on was the atrocious damage inflicted on the lovely B&W analogue images. The digital rendering on the copies that I received made viewing impossible. Severely distorted to the point of image disintegration is not an overstatement. Buyer beware. Don't waste your money on this failed conversion.
2,Fantastic Movie - Sub-Par Disk,"While this is a classic and beautiful movie in its own right, the disc I received could not run with the subtitles on at about the halfway mark. It could run without just fine, but as I am a native English speaker, I require them to fully enjoy.Alas it is too late to return the goods (it was a gift) to see if all discs share this problem, but buyers please be aware."
2,Mughale-E-Azam,We really wanted to see this movie but couldn't get the subtitles to work. Also the studio who produced the dvd had an incredible amount of cheesy previews. We tried the subtitles on two different players but no go. Hope we can find another one that works since it looks like a great movie. The worst packaging we've ever seen.
4,Solid overview of an important figure,"This is an enjoyable read. Excellent detail, especially about Paine's religious views and his time in France during the Revolution there. Paine nearly lost his head in France, and there were many who would have gladly done the same after he returned to the United States in the early 19th Century. But his impact on his times was quite profound. It is necessary to understand Tom Paine if one wishes to get at the origins and course of the American and French Revolutions. This book is a good means to that important end."
3,Keane's Good Friend Tom Paine,"An interesting biography, heavily- if not well- researched. Partisan, but Keane does manage a bit of perspective. The main problems come with the background. There is both too much - I for one could do without the often inaccurate disquisitions on eighteenth-century England - and too much WRONG. Keane seems to think that Britain and America were at war in 1787, and that Adam Smith visited Paris at that time (p.284-5). Hobbes is both more and less than a 'philosopher of counterrrevolution.'Furthermore, it seems a man only had to bump into Paine for Keane to count him a 'close friend'. What was the extent of Paine's friendship with Goldsmith (this is interesting) and with Burke (very important)?I get the impression that Keane did all his research for the book and had no grounding in the subject before. But it's an engrossing read for all that."
5,A book for all times,"As I read this book, I couldn't help but think, where is the Tom Paine of our time? The insights that Tom Paine had are needed today more than ever."
4,essential,the medical view on the healthcare crisis. the real goods. if you ever wondered what doctors really think about our healthcare system this is the video to watch.
3,"PHYSICIAN, HEAL THYSELF","PARTS ARE O.K. BUT HAS MAJOR FLAWS.Too many morbidly obese doctors are featured including some new medical school graduates with triple chins - including one who aspires to be a cardiologist!Several doctors important in health optimization are totally ignored:John McDougall, Joel Fuhrmann, Dean Ornish, Caldwell Esselstyn et al.Putting lipstick on a pig does not transform it from being a pig.Using ""Health Care System"" again and again and again and againdoes NOT make our Sickness Care Business health-promoting.

1,"Very general, not at all practical","It's just advertising all these online superstars, nothing more. Very general advices. They say ""Oh, yeah, you should do THIS, and you are all set."" But then... How EXACTLY do I do this??? There's ninfo on that. So for those who need something practical, skip this book.At least I borrowed it from the library. I would be pissed if I paid!"
5,Tara Alexandra Kachaturoff,"Knowledge is power as it says in Mitch Meyerson's latest book, Success Secrets of the Online Marketing Superstars. From Andy Wibbels information on blogging to Michael Port's contribution on creating products for the web, this book has something for everyone. Success Secrets of the Online Marketing Superstars provides a comprehensive overview of the world of online marketing. You'll learn about everything from shopping carts to webconferencing, from creating more traffic to your website, to writing more effective web copy. Meyerson interviews the best of the best featuring successful entrepreneurs like Jay Conrad Levinson, Mark Victor Hansen, and Robert Allen. Even if you're not yet up and running with your own online business, the book's information, tips, tactics, and techniques will provide you with the foundation you need to create a success strategy going forward."
4,A great introduction,"to the true online marketing superstars. Although no compilation of great interviews will provide you a single shot to success, Success Secrets will introduce you to those who will teach you how. Those like Jay Conrad Levinson, David Garfinkel and Joe Vitale, all of whom have incredible flocks of true believers. I know, because we publish for them at Morgan James Publishing. I am disappointed, however, that Armand Morin, Robert Anthony, Stephen Pierce and Ted Ciuba weren't included in the book."
4,Great overview for those who want to embrace the power of the Internet to build their business online,"""Want an easy to read and understand overview of the essential 'need to know' strategies about building a business online? Then get this book. Even though I know and teach the same content, I still refer to this book for myself and for my clients."""
3,not as fun as other haba foods,"I really expected this banana to be larger, it's only about the length of my index finger. It's not shaped like the fruit as other haba foods are, it's a flat on both sides with lines painted on it - not realistic at all. The size is small enough to confuse the kids, it's the length of two of the haba grapes but in real life a banana is much larger than two grapes. It's just an odd little toy. All that said, it is very good quality like all haba foods and is made in Germany (nice to know after all those toy recalls). I don't think I would have bought it if I had seen it in person first but it's not so bad as to make me want to return it. The pictures of haba foods really should show them next to something like a coin or ruler to show their size."
1,mouth doesn't line up,This mug is a serious waste of money. The mouth opening doesn't line up the right way when you screw the lid on no matter what.
4,fine,"With this helmet I am looking good when driving my scooter on the streets. It is possible that people on the streets thinking that Germans army again came back to Helsinki, Finland since 1918."
1,this thing is huge,"i think this helmet sucks because the helmet is huge. i have a small head because im a small guy. i ordered a size medium. when i recieved the helmet, i realized that the helmet doesnt change size, the padding inside the helmet does. so the helmet is the same size no matter what size you order."
5,Sweet,I have liked these dudes for a while there sweet like a heavier Greeley Estates which is a complete bad ass band. Great album.
1,Cheap,This product was delivered and appeared cheap and had a strange plastic smell to it. It was not what I was looking for my boyfriend at the time as a nice Christmas gift.
2,Too small,"It's so small it doesn't even look like a loaf of bread. I wouldn't get this product again, it's just too tiny."
4,cute little roll,"This toy bread loaf is very well made, as all haba toys are, but it loses a star for being so small. It completely fits in the palm of my hand. All haba toy foods are made to be roughly the same size so sometimes items that are large in real life, like this loaf of bread, appear to be disproportionately small compared to other foods. It's still lots of fun though!"
4,Cool Surf Film,"This surf film definitely makes you want to visit Canada for surfing. I never knew Nova Scotia got that big. As an east coaster, I repect the surf seen in this film. The music is energetic (a band named Gob dominates most of it) and appropriate for the high powered waves. The west coast footage is pretty amazing and some of the surfers out there are definitely rip. The snowboarding and acting segments make this video cool as hell. Buy it."
4,Epic Surf in a New Frontier,"Canada. A place where you never thought surfing existed comes to life in this video. Althought I'm sure many people where 6/4's up there in the winter (3/2 in the summer) 5mm takes you there the untammed north of Canada. It explores some descent surf from Nova Scotia and British Columbia, althought I've seen better surf from Nova Scotia than on this video. . . it still gets the message across. Filled with the culture and guts behind Canadian surfing we get to respect our counterpart up and north as it entices us to try the massive and cool barrels of the north. Try truenorthproductions.tripod.com for other surfing films."
5,Fossil Watch,This watch is just like in the picture. Fabulous to look at and fabulous on. Delivery was speedy and in a timely fashion. Well done.
1,BREAKS EASILY,"My son just turned 3 yesterday. My mother in law bought him this. We had it less than 6 hours before the gears stripped out and the wheels will no longer turn. NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!It should not be advertised for 2 year olds. I don't think i would have noticed the PHRASING on the box that states ""perfect for toddlers...LEARNING TO TAKE THIER FIRST STEPS"" ...that is the key phrase. If they can already walk and run with this toy THEY WILL BREAK IT.Also there is no lid for where you place the bubbles. If your toddler knocks this over...all the bubbles spill out the stack. An impossible mess for carpet!I absolutely would steer clear of this toy. Buy a bubble gun powered with batteries...you can buy 6 for the cost of this hunk of junk! If your going to spend this much on a Thomas toy...I would recommend you buy the die cast metal characters....those withstand the rigors of toddlerhood and then some!"
5,Interesting Unknown book....,This book should be an eBook and I'm sorry it is no longer in print. Interesting book and fun to read.
4,Thriller,If your in to books that will make your spine tingle this is a great one. It has murder and ghosts and mystery surrounding all of it.
3,Great results!,"Excelent product, easy to use alone or with other contraceptive method. Also it's a great alternative to use it like a lubricant. You dont have to wait long and your parter neither."
3,Use only if you have no other birth control alternatives,"Pros:-With diaphragm, effective in minimizing risk of pregnancy.-Relatively quick to use, especially with some prior practice of diaphragm insertion.-Can feel better than using a condom.Cons:-Can increase chances of contracting HIV, does not protect against other STIs either.-Can cause irritation, itchiness, and/or numbness in the vagina. It does make my vagina itchy and numb.-Contains parabens, which are associated with breast cancer (but correlation does not mean causation). Parabens also mimic estrogen, which play a role in developing breast cancer and also leads to early puberty in girls.My suggestion:Use this product only if you have no other birth control alternatives. Hormonal contraceptives seem best for preventing pregnancies, but if you want non-hormonal methods like I do, then condoms (without spermicide) are your safest bet."
1,This watch is nice in appearance but apparently cheaply made!,"This watch is nice in appearance but apparently cheaply made. I received it approx. mid-Dec. 2012. It is a pulsar and I purchased this only due to the fact that my pulsar watch, that I have owned and worn for approx. 6 years, broke at the clasp. This watch, that I just purchased from Amazon, broke at the clasp after wearing it for approx. 4 weeks. I could have lost it, if it was not for the long sleeve shirt that I was wearing, was folded at the wrists. I will purchase one at a store rather than on line. In addition, I paid $10.00 to have five links removed as the watch is made rather large. That was well over three weeks ago. It was a professional jeweler that I brought it to, so there was no issue there. Nice to look but it is best to spend a few more dollars and get a better product."
2,Flimsy,"This item was much flimsier than I expected- and it bent on its own after being exposed to the windy elements of where I live. After about a year, it was put in the trash unfortunately. It's the right idea, but not made for durability."
3,Serves the purpose,"I neglected to review the products measurements. Several of my neighbors have a similar sign and I thought it was as tall as theirs and it is not. The product is flimsy and looks like it will break easily, however, we have had a few strong winds and it's stil standing with no damage so it serves the purpose."
1,IT WONT WORK,"THIS PRODUCT WON T WORK IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK DO NOT BUY, YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR MONEY FROM THIS SELLER AND IT IS A HUSTLE TO SEND IT BACK AND EXPENSIVE, DON T BUY IT. YOU WILL KEEP GETING THIS MESSAGE ERROR 1305 D PROGRAM YOUR COMPANY VERIFY THAT THE FILE EXIST CONTACT YOUR VENDOR."
1,not what I expected,"This book is a style guide, with guidance like, ""When introducing small sections that contain subsections, use itemized lists rather than sentences""; ""Begin optional steps with a clear visual and verbal indication that they are not mandatory""; and ""When listing commands, follow the capitalization rules on which your product is based."" The beginning and end of the book provide a shallow discussion of single sourcing, but much of the book is style guidance like this. Maybe I'm missing something, but what does that have to do with single sourcing? I sure don't understand these 5-star reviews and encourage you to flip through the pages of this book before buying so you know what you're getting."
3,Daughters of emptiness: Poems of Chinese Buddhist Nuns,"I found the poetry to be rather difficult for me to understand, perhaps because of the tranlations into English. This volume needs far more than 1 or 2 readings to grasp its importance and messages."
1,This has not been delivered,"I am still waiting for this order. It's been a long time. It's bought and paid for, but not delivered to me."
4,Kenko Uniplus Tube extention ring,What can I say other than it works well. I have had it for over a year and have taken some pretty awesome up close photos of flowers and insects.
4,"Pretty great, but doesn't support EF-S lenses","First off, an extension ring is a GREAT way to convert a regular lens to an insane macro lens. The Kenko ring is about 1/2 the price of a Canon, but the downside with this particular one is it's only got the EF mount, no EF-S."
1,no stars would be more accurate.,"Scott Waddle has turned the tragedy of a ship collision which he was ultimately responsible for into a money making proposition. He's no different than a teenager showing off his hot car, killing nine people, except the teen goes to jail for manslaughter, and Waddle goes on to a profitable speaking career. They should have let the Japanese deal with him."
1,Unbelievable,"I have served onboard USS Greeneville for the last three years. After I finished reading the book, I at first did not know what to feel, but later I became simply angry and did not know why. Now I do. Many of his claims about what the command was like and what a supposedly wonderful boat we were under his command are simply false. Much of the success we enjoyed under CDR Waddle was due to the well-trained senior enlisted and officers from CDR Guy's tour as CO. True, the climate was enjoyable, and I did enjoy coming to work every day, but the same standards of behavior and performance were not applied to nuclear and non-nuclear personnel. This is what led to 9 Feb, not an isolated 8 minutes."
1,This is a joke,I served on the USS Salvor (First Navy ship on the scene) when this incident occured. I remember that Friday night looking out into the dark sea knowing those men had already drowned. This tragedy should not have occured. The information I received then was that Captain Waddle was wooing civilians by letting them hang out while he ordered a emergency resurfacing without checking above the water. This man caused 9 men to lose their lives. He should not be allowed to make a profit from this.
2,Preachy and Biased,"This book is clearly biased and over-preachy. I found the interesting content to be in regards to the history and information pertaining to the submarine. Waddle made a grave mistake and ended up on the chopping block. While everyone makes mistakes, I couldn't help but feel that he was a little whiney and used his religious beliefs to hide the fact that he showed little or no remorse. Personally, I'm not buying any of it. How does a man like this end up in charge of a nuclear submarine?"
1,Don't buy this book,"This book would lead you to believe that Scott Waddle is an icon of moral courage, an outstanding Naval Officer, and a crusader for good and ""the Right Thing."" Not true. He twists facts, omits information, and misleads the reader to further his self-aggrandizing scheme. Though I have no doubt that he feels regret for his personal and direct responsibility for the Ehime Maru incident, and no doubt that the Navy could have handled some aspects of the aftermath better, his efforts to make himself out to be a noble and honorable victim of circumstance are deplorable to me and every one of my fellow Submarine Officers to which I have spoken. His career has not been one of unmitigated success due to his personal talent and honor, as the book portrays, but one punctuated by questionable acts which he dodges through his charisma and powerful friends. He may be worthy of your pity, but he is not worthy of the money he would get from you buying this book of drivel."
1,Sloping shoulders,"I read this book thinking that I may have been handed an insight into what went through the mind of this submarine CO when disaster struck. What I found after ""As the CO I am solely responsible"" was a slopy shouldered attempt to blame everyone but himself ie the Fire Control sailor didn't do his job otherwise nothing would have happened etc etc etc. Then there was the ""This is God's will, God is great"" stuff that high profile people involved in incidents tend to lament. Don't waste your money. The six hours spent reading this I will never get back."
3,It's Lonely in the Air,"The sometimes hilarious, sometimes not memoir of a woman who has spent much of her young life as a flight attendant. Many people envy the life of a flight attendant, thinking they have the best of all worlds, getting to stop off in New York, London, Paris, etc. etc. all in one day. This behind-the-scenes look reveals what those lonely flights are really like, what it's like to never get to see the cities that are just outside your door each day, what it's like to sign up for a job that you think is going to show you everything and bring loads of excitement, but then doesn't.-- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"
2,Snore,"I bought this book at a used book sale... I paid $1. If I had paid any more for this, I would have been disappointed.I read this book on a 5 hour plane ride... I made it halfway through the book, then finally stopped and thought to myself, ""This woman has spent over 150 pages saying NOTHING."" And that's where I stopped reading.A few funny lines, but mostly a bore."
2,looks like a comedy reads rather drearily,"maybe i was in the wrong mood for this book but i found it dreary rather than funny. It is full of her disappointments and wrong turns, and while she can wax philosophical about all of these, that wasnt enough to make it an enjoyable read. I love New York and small town life but i didnt find much to like in this one.Julie/Julia and the Jen Lancaster books are much funnier, as are the books by Bill Bryson (although space those out...he gets a bit sarcastic and wearing if read too closely together)"
5,Excellent,"I don't think I can add much to what the other reviewers have said.This is an excellent, excellent work on many levels. Highly recommended."
5,Anne,This is a true story of Anne and her family during WWII and the struggles they endured. It is a must read for anyone interested in how this family overcame their life during the war and their life afterward in America.
5,"Extremely helpful, very informative","Dr. Foster has written a classic book to be read by all who have come across back pain and back injury. This book serves as a refresher for those in the medical industry, and it serves to educate patients and family members of those afflicted with back pain.This is a very easy read, and the reader will come away with a much greater understanding of what those with back pain are dealing with. I would highly recommend this read to all those with a need for information on this complex issue."
4,"Worth reading, especially for social workers",This book has some good information in it. I would recommend it for those in the social work field. I think you will find it useful.
1,Sad Sequel,"Godwin tried too hard.""Prison Planet"" is great, I enjoy re-reading it every so often. I was looking forward to the sequel.However, I dropped this book into the discard pile about halfway through; I'd rather straightforward plots rather than contrived complexity. Instead of overcoming obstacles through ingenuity and perseverance, Godwin has the Ranarokians facing despicable Earth/ Athena characters and aliens with no apparent redeeming qualities. A constant parade of difficulties appear out of nowhere (""third level spaceship? Eh?) with little foundation or rationale.Maybe it gets better in the second half, but ....Anyone wants it- price of shipping."
5,Great Transaction,"Informal Paneled White NotesWell packed and prompt shipment. Beautiful Crane & Co. informal notes, as described. Thanks so much!"
5,A Delight for Christians Who are Serious About the Faith,"This is a totally fascinating book for someone who truly and passionately wants undefiled wisdom from God rather than from man. Reading it is the highlight of my week, as was the NIV Application commentary on Revelation, Hebrews and Psalms. I absolutely love this series and have made it a priority to try and get through as much of it as I can."
1,very dissapointed,Too big for what I wanted. The light is very dim. I think in a dark room it would be great. I wanted it for travel and can't see lugging this thing around.
3,Review of A-W Chemistry,Very comprehensive textbook - touches on many different aspects of chemistry and provides students with a broad range of topics in general chemistry. Excellent as a full-year text or as a study guide text.
1,Haywire,"I am sitting here in a very frustrated state of mind. I have McAfee which has allowed a virus, Downloader AWX, to break into a file and I can locate no technical support. Their 1-800 is closed all weekend and today is Saturday. When their office is open it is virtually impossible to speak to a person.This is the second time I have sought support and could locate none. Their website is completely non-user-friendly. It is totally hostile! They have many boxes of choices, selections and questions--you feel you have to tackle 50 quarterbacks to get past go.I do not want to have anything to do with this backward peration again.This may be last thing I write for a long time as this computeris going haywire."
2,what is the author's intent?,"Seriously what did the female character see in the male character? his overdrinking? his uncaring and disrespect of women? his 10 yr old temper tantrum after his music was taken from him? For someone supposed to be sensible, her attraction to him made no sense to me. It seems the author was going for the good girl\bad boy dynamic where the man needs saving and the supposed intelligent and sensible girl is reduced to a shivering mess just because he smiles at her, nevermind that she was aware of his less than noble intentions. This message is false to me and I did not enjoy this book because of it. The man was infantile and needed to grow up. A 2 star rating."
3,Nice Fluff,"A good read for what it is. I would call this an ""airport"" read. If you miss a few pages you can still hold on to the plot and not care."
2,What's up with all the 5 star reviews?,This book dragged. It was a pain to get through the first few chapters then it still dragged! Ugh....had to force myself to finish the book.
3,Not the best but not the worst,"I like Annette Broadrick so I was excited to get three of her older stories in one. Now, this book wasn't a total let down, but it wasn't the best one around. I did not really connect with the characters in any way at all. But, if you are looking for a fast read, rent it from your local library or borrow it from a friend."
5,A Good Resource,This book is very organized and helpful for finding good children's books. I enjoyed going through the book finding all the books I read as a child and seeing how they were reviewed. This book also gave me ideas on what books I should have my children read when they grow older. I definitely recommend this book.
3,Not a terrible compilation.,I only gave this three stars because I got it to try to sleep to. Sometimes it was so low I could barely hear it and then it would almost explode with sound. Pretty good if you're just sitting and reading a book. But not a good CD to sleep too.
2,Not exactly what I wanted,Music is TOO soft. Barely can hear the melody. Nevertheless a deal for the price. W w w w w
4,This book can help to meditate for people who know what meditation is.,Agree. This book can help to meditate for people who know what meditation is. I don't think all who read this one know what meditation is. It's better to read something about spirituality and meditation generally. Two or three books. and only then begin to read books like Wildmind. For example try to start from a crossing or the drop's history by Anatoliy Obraztsov. It's a very easy book what explain your a lot.
3,THIS RUDE BOY'S BANGING WIT SOME MENTAL JOINTS,"The price of this album was made worthwhile by Westwoods introduction. I must have heard it over 50 times, and i laugh everytime (because he's serious when he saying it). In fact its so good i'm gonna share it with u, check-it-UK, understand whats about to go down. Westwood- the album, and we gonna BANG in your face wit the hottest joints on the street. Real hip-hop, nothin' but BIG thingz, now drop the BOMB.It may not sound that funny if BIGGIE or DMX was saying it but this guy is unique in his deliberation. (P.S For free laughs why not check out this peeps radio show). As for the tunes, well they are as commercial as they get which makes the album sell. After all its all about the chedder. The songs are ok, but i recommend borrowing it instead of buying it. Here's to Westwood."
1,Easterners Lying About The West,"This is an interesting book because it illustrates an interesting phenomenon of the 18050's--Easterners lying about the West. The author, Samuel Woodworth Cozzens, clearly never visited Arizona or New Mexico. The history is wrong. The geography is wrong. The people are wrong. Many of the places are imaginary, and the real places aren't as they are described in this book. The pictures are imaginative, but not really from this planet, much less the Southwest. Anyone who has ever visited Chaco Canyon will be amused at the fanciful drawing of a place labeled Canyon De Chaco. As just one of many factual errors, the author goes into great detail about how amazed the Apaches were to see that he would actually bathe in a stream since he claimed the idea was foreign to them. In reality the Apaches bathed often and were shocked at how rarely the Anglos of the day did. The book will be amusing to anyone who lives in the Southwest and has even a minimal knowledge of its history."
3,same problem as other guy..video is great,"same problem with the lip sync....the picture is awesome and at first i thought it was the me or the components but it does it on my computer,my regular tv and my xbox while watching movies. like is said the picture is solid but i would have to turn the tv off to get the lip sync to work then 15 minutes later it was off again."
2,Avoid Westinghouse! Buyers beware!,"My whole family and I thought we were going crazy when we first started noticing the audio wasn't synced with the video. We originally thought it was the cable hook-up, and the cable service came out twice to replace the box. The sync was STILL off! So finally we came to the conclusion that it was our beautiful new TV. The picture is fantastic, but sadly the non-synced audio and video can drive one insane. After reading tons of negative reviews on various websites, we were relieved to know we were not alone.We're exchanging it at the store later today for something different."
1,Breaks after 2-3 years,"I bought this tv in january of 2008 and september 25th of 2010 it has now broken. If i turn it on with the remote or go up to the tv and press the on button on that it still will not turn on axcept for the blue light on the bottom of the TV which is just to show that your TV is on but its not on. I would not buy this because the production quality of this TV is horrible, I have a TV from 1998 that still works and this LCD HDTV can't even out last a 10 inch TV from 1998. Just save your money and buy a TV that is worth the money you are gonna spend."
1,$250 mainboard went out after14 months,if you buy one make sure you get extended warranty our main board crashed after 14 months ($250 before labor)
1,Looks like a bad Youtube video,"I looked at this model in the store, and it was the worst TV in the whole place. I couldn't believe it. The picture was grainy, pixelated, and there was a severe image lag problem. I'd describe it as watching a really bad DVD rip while trying to defrag your hard drive and run a virus scan. Sure it's an LCD HDTV, but wow...if it's a choice between this and a low-def tube, stick with the tube."
1,Would't erase,"I bought a dry erase calender to organize my life and make it easier these are the 1st markers I have used, and now they will probably always have their mark on my brand new calendar. That I was looking forward to using for many years. I tried a dry cloth 1st, then concentrate Windex, then foaming window cleaner, then bleach water. There are still marks and I need to write the new month in. I'm still going to try to get the marks off wish me luck. I'm going to need it. DON""T BUY THESE unless you want to buy a new dry erase board."
1,Test on a small surface before really using!,"This is totally my fault, but I'm still not happy about what happened. I purchased these markers as a lost-cost alternative to the Crayola dry erase pens in my son's Activity Board. Well, instead of testing on a small area first, we just sat down and played a game of dots. When my son went to erase a drawing, we then realized that the marker wouldn't erase!!! So we ruined a brand-new Activity Board. $20 down the drain."
3,Compelling reading... up to a point,"I'm a big Vernor Vinge fan, and bought this book on the strength of the first section (which was reprinted in a compendium. This book may appear to be new, but is actually also a reprint, too). This is a good way to read ""early"" Vernor Vinge, and the story/characters/locations make for compelling reading in the first parts of the book. But the last section just doesn't hold together, as it involves the murky motives of [spoiler warning] off-worlders who are never fully developed as characters, and their motives are based on really silly sci-fi. So while it didn't live up to my expectations, it did make for decent plane-reading on a transcon trip.-avi"
3,Worth reading for Vinge fans,"The book is a rough work, not very easy to follow. Definitely worth reading for people who already love Vernor Vinge, but I wouldn't buy it otherwise."
3,Science Fiction with Fantasy Backdrop,"This early set of works from Vinge, are at times quite interesting; but, the ending fails to truly satisfy the buildup.The 2nd and 3rd stories were published as short stories in 1968 and 1969, with the ""prequel"" being published in 1986, thus giving this ""Trilogy"" enough bulk to allow it to be published as a three part novel TATJA GRIMM'S WORLD. While Tatja Grimm is one of the main characters in each of the short stories, she is actually not the hero or heroine in any of them - indeed, she actually plays the ""bad guy"" more often than not in the 2nd & 3rd stories... only in the first story is she made out to be a ""good guy"".One peeve worth mentioning... the art on the cover, while good, does not depict any actual scene from within the book... yes, there are human inhabited ""termite mounds"" described in detail in one of the stories in the book - but the termite mounds are obviously land based (who ever heard of ""sea termites""!)"
2,Not my favorite Vernor Vinge book...,"This started off really well. Then it took some very fast twists and turns that left me wondering if I wasn't reading a book that was missing some chapters. This was an interesting idea for a story, but eventually you begin to consider Svir and Cor as the protagonists and Tatja is just an annoyance. By the end, you are depressed because the characters you've come to care about most (including Anchu) have been killed off and Tatja's future is - well - Grimm.Too disjointed and too depressing for me. I only give it two stars. My favorite Vernor Vinge book so far is A Fire Upon The Deep."
2,Not His Best Work,"Some cool ideas, but poorly executed. Lost interest 1/3 of the way through. If you are expecting anything remotely on the level of A Fire Upon the Deep or A Deepness in the Sky, you will be very disappointed. Great author, one of my favorites, but apparently just spooling up back then."
3,Good scifi,I enjoyed the story as it unfolded. It was nothing really special but it was still enjoyable. No heavy tech and such and definitely not a space opera. There were some good ideas though. I thought that the characters were well developed. I enjoyed the descriptions of the big ocean going barge and of the scenery throughout the novel.
1,Not For Hard Science Fiction Enthusiasts,"BEWARE. First of all, let me say that I am a big Vernor Vinge fan. I have read and loved most of his work. So when I saw that this novel was coming out early this year (2006), I ordered it sight unseen. However, as it turns out, this is NOT a new book. It is a reprinting of an older novel. And, it is NOT science fiction - it is fantasy? What, Vernor Vinge?? Yup, fantasy. If I was jaded, I would say that this is a sneaky ploy on the part of Professor Vinge's publisher to make a fast buck. My advice - leave this old mummy be and read another Charles Scheffield or Greg Egan novel."
2,Oh dear!,"I'd never heard of this and watched for Ginger. If this is not one of the worst films of her career, I don't know what is. Pretty awful!"
1,A Closer look at creationist propaganda...,"A poor attempt to validate scriptural claims through poorly supported ""evidence"" and erroneous concepts that would only seem logical to individuals who either cannot understand the most simple of biological concepts and scientific theories or have extreme cognitive biases and refuse to accept the ever growing mountain of scientific evidence.I would recommend this book to the religious zealots who regard science as an attack on scriptural authority.."
3,"Good, but not what I expected","What I expected from the description was a book presenting comparisons of evidence between creationism and evolution in point-for-point facts. A strong selling feature for myself was the comment of it being written in laymans terms. (as opposed to the scientific approach of other books)Instead the book is actually made up of 365 (as in daily) facts dealing with several categories of creation supportive ""mini-reports"". Yes, these daily thoughts are listed starting with January 1st and go through the calendar to the end of the year. These extremely short items, while interesting, never go into any depth. They simply state a fact and then end with an appropriate or related Bible verse. Imagine an important event from history condensed to two paragraphs and it will give you an idea as to the ""just getting started"" feeling presented in this books ""single page"" format. I agree with the basis of the beliefs presented, but the format and lack of depth was disappointing."
1,recovering life,"Knowing what was going on in this mans life, this book was a chance to make money and not a true reflection of what he was really doing in his life. This book and the dishonesty involved in telling this story was only the beginning of Darryl's dishonesty with his peers and the public but most of all with himself and those he was hurting. I can only hope and pray this family is finally getting honest, once and for all to save his life."
1,A bad experience indeed !,"I have used McAfee for several years with no problem, but this version is poorly done. First it failed to completely remove my old version. After I finally got it working it fails to pick up the test virus and that bothers me. Then I find out I have to call customer support to get a password to download the current version because the one I installed is already outdated. now I can't get customer service to answer. I bought it, ignoring the bad reviews and got burned. It's your choice now."
1,Mc Afee Anti Virus,TERRIBLE- My computer worked fine until I downloaded this. Once in it continually froze my computer. Had to restart. Even when I put the computer to sleep when I would go to start it up it was frozen. Finally I uninstalled it and no problems since.In addition while installed it slowed my computer down in all areas.
2,"Crashes System, No Support","When McAfee VirusScan crashes my system, their tech support has two suggestions: Step 1: Reinstall the software Step 2: Buy an upgrade If that doesn't work, maybe you can start over at Step 1."
1,Inútil,Cuando compré el producto no sabía nada sobre el servicio al cliente de Mcafee. El resultado fue que tenía un antivirus que no se podía actualizar.
5,For the Photographer Within,This is a moving book to guide all would-be photographers (and some who already are) to articulate their highest vision.
4,god is at eye level,"If you keep photos on your refrigerator as pieces of beauty ontop of the mundane or if you find yourself wishing you had your camera when you see something that would, in a different light look ordinary, then you will appreciate Phillips use of photography. This is the encouragement to use your camera as an extension of your eye and ,with practice, an extension of your heart. _Practical exercises put dreamy descriptions to use at the conclusion of each chapter."
4,Very good book for people who wants new perspective.,"The book brings a new and fresh vision about how to look (and photograph) the world. It's not about technique, but about how sometimes we try to create artificial concepts to our photographic vision.A warning: This book os not suitable for people wanting technicalities and formal composition study. It's about seeing wonder in the common things."
4,Wonderful reading rythm . Too funny. Wish I could find them!,Too fuuny. Anyone dealing with day to day home repairs will appreciate the humor and wish they could find 4 PUPS & a WORM. My son thinks the pictures are funny. Its fun to read.
5,I Want to Call 4 Pups and a Worm,"After enjoying a glass of wine one night I decided to check the mail. Some books from my daughter's book club had arrived. I opened the package and felt compelled to read this short book, 4 Pups and a Worm. It was a delightful read. Do yourself a favor and read it loud one the first read. It is a hilarious little read. I can't wait to listen to my husband read it tonight. Seems like the author has a great sense of humor."
1,Totally unacceptable,"Though described as a ""paperback"", this item arrived in a term-paper-type folder and appeared to have been copied on an old-fashioned mimeograph machine.It was Not a book or even a booklet by any stretch of the imagination. I would have rated it zero stars if possible. I returned it as quickly as possible."
1,Unbelievable,"The only thing I can say is that I cannot believe I wasted 99 cents on this ""book"" which in my opinion is not a book but rather a short story."
3,"Short, interesting read","Was really a short story, as opposed to a book, but I liked it. Took me about 20 minutes to read it at most."
5,Time Slowed Down,"A Creole man is arrested as a Confederate spy and sentenced to hanging on the bridge over Owl Creek. The rope breaks, the man hits the water and dives. Surviving a shower of Yankee bullets he escapes downriver and into the safety of a thicket. He struggles to get home and the story gets increasingly surreal. He is greeted at the gate of his plantation house by his smiling, lovely wife--but--his wife died years earlier....Rod Steiger adopted this excellent tale for a 'Twilight Zone' Showing. It worked very well."
3,(Very) Short Story.,"I had heard that this story had a really great twist ending and so I was excited to read it before knowing too much about it (was afraid to Wikipedia it, for fear of finding out the ending!). It was a good story, but I feel silly for buying it. Had no idea it was only about 17 pages long...The shipping was fast and reliable. No objections there."
5,Good For Little Girls,Got them for a little girl who is almost 7. She loves them and they are holding up very well. She got two pairs and both look well made and true to picture color. From what I can tell the sizes run spot on as well.
3,Not enough vendor-specific detail,"The book gives many examples of how to fine-tune SQL statements, and usually displays performance gain/loss resulted from the fine-tuning right below the examples. But the result is shown in the format ""##/8"", meaning the DBMS's of ## vendors out of the ""big 8"" show performance gain. For me this information is not too much helpful, since I only work on Microsoft SQL Server and am not very interested in other verdors. If the book can give more vendor-specific examples and explanations it will be more helpful, at least for me."
4,Auron Action Figurine,"The Auron figurine from Final Fantasy X is an extremely detailed, durable figure. It has several options for customization based on events in the game, for example allowing Aurons arm to hang free of the kimono or a built in piece thats included to fold Aurons arm into the kimono with the sleeve hanging free, as he is often seen in the game. The detail of his outfit is spectacular, including a hanging sake jug, numerous flexible straps, tassels, and ribbons all of which are brightly colored. The leg articulation is limited but has to remain solid for him to stand. The sword is loose so it can be arranged how you wish him to hold it, or not at all. He has fairly reasonable arm movement and also included head articulation which is surprisingly decent. The figurine comes with extra hand position pieces and a doll stand. All in all, a very satisfyingly accurate figurine for a collector."
5,Excellent.,Rather you're a Final Fantasy or Auron fan this is a great figure. Nice attention to detail. Only complaint is upper leg joints not as mobile as you might like. Excellent figure over all. I'd reccomend.
3,Could break,"The joints of right arm and leg broke while I was gently trying to give it a fighting stance. Otherwise, it is a great replica of everyone's favorite: Auron from Final Fantasy X."
3,Good to look at,"This Toy is a very detailed, very good looking figure, but the joints in the right arm and one of the legs are faulty. Just the simple process of posing him will cause them to snap. I've gone through 2, and decided to keep the third one in the box. Many other people have had problems with it. I suggest if you buy it, you keep it in the box too."
4,Review,"The figure came in a package that had circle tape(I'm under the impression that circle tape is what makes products like these legit). The figure was very satisfactory in paint job but my figure's feet were uneven so he couldn't stand on his own. I have tried to bend them back without trying to break anything but to no avail. Also, I have heard horrendous stories of people trying to put on his replacement arm with disastrous results, like breaking off the initial clothed arm part, so I have not tried doing that. Must have for Auron fans and for the price and time of this review, definitely a steal."
1,Keep it in the box,"I bought two of this toy by accident, and with both of them, they werent out of the box 5 minutes without the sword breaking. It is top-heavy and any little bumb will break it at the base of the blade. All Play arts figures are pretty flimsy but this one is just poorly designed."
2,It wasn't helpful.,"I borrowed it from a friend and I applied, but I don't Have any money from scholarships"
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"If your looking for a book that can really teach you all of the specifics of the game, this is not the one to get. It is generally sparce, filled with common, unhelpful information, and redundant.Avoid this book."
3,Jill Knight,"I came across Jill at Ghiradelli Square during a recent visit to San Francisco. Usually street performances lack quality for a number of reasons, the least of which is talent of the performer, however, as I'm walking around I'm assaulted by this beautiful sound. I hadn't noticed a music store, so I thought, ""they're piping in nice music"". Then I came across the stage, and this beautiful sound is coming from a real live person. A cross between Joan Baez and Martina McBride, a purity of voice seldom heard, and the message of her songs are wonderfully presented."
5,Somebody sign this woman FAST!!,I had the extreme pleasure of hearing Jill Knight in person on two separate occasions while strolling around San Francisco's Pier 39. The first time was a little over three years ago and each and every time her voice has moved me near tears. The voice of an angel is how I best describe her. Please support her music. I own her CDs and would highly recommend her to anyone. And somebody sign this woman FAST!!
5,Jill Knight a multi-talented performer,"I heard Jill Knight performing in Cannery Row in San Fransico in July. What a pleasant evening! Jill is a very talented vocalist, songwriter, and guitarist. Purchased this CD that evening and I haven't stop listening to it."
1,Worst book I've ever tried to read...,"I got through about 80 pages, and it was the worst read of my life. The book starts with a gruesomely detailed murder, and then goes on to plumb such literary depths as one women's miscarriage, subsequent gang rape, pregnancy from said gang rape, and her descent into prostitution. Then of course she's punched in the stomach by her pimp right after she gives birth, as he's attempting to murder her newborn son (the boy is a cripple and a rape baby... excellent qualifications for infanticide). 80 pages of ""what's the worst thing that can happen to a woman"" is not my idea of humor, nor should it be anyone else's."
2,Not quite as clever as it thinks it is,"I bought this book after enjoying other books by Peter David (in the Babylon 5 series), and seeing the high rating in Amazon.After reading the first third of the book, my reaction is that the humor is rather adolescent, and predictable. The story is intriguing, but rather flat and not fleshed out.I read fewer books than I used to, so those that I read need to be really good. This book is falling below my threshold of an enjoyable read.... I hope it improves before the end; otherwise I might not make it...."
1,"Slogging, desperate, and self-important","I tried, I really did. I wanted to like Sir Apropos but simply could not wallow through one more page of misery and despair set in a world where ABSOLUTELY everyone is happy to indulge in rape (I kid you not, there are 3 rapes in the first 150 pages), pillage, and murder. This is by no means a fast, fun satire -- as one reviewer claimed. Satire involves wit and an appreciation for the object being satirized. This is a book filled with loathing, self-obsession, and violence. It is drowning in its own crapulence."
2,Apropos of originality.... this book is not.,"The cliches were exhaustive and exhausting. I suspect other readers will, like myself run from this book ""like priest in a .... factory"" (David's phrase). This was a real disappointment for a longtime reader of Mr. David's work."
1,If you like Terry Pratchett... read one of his books instead,"Awful, awful, awful. A must to avoid. If I could give this book a negative rating, I would. ""Sir Apropos of Nothing"" is full of cheap puns, weak characters, and contrived plotlines, all written in a cloying, self-amused (VERY self-amused) style that gets more and more irritating with every page. Peter David obviously read a Terry Pratchett book one day and said to himself, ""Hey, I can do that."" I'm sorry, Mr. David, but you can't. There is a crucial difference, sir, between you and Mr. Pratchett. He is funny, and you are not. Stick to writing comic books. You are at least good at that."
4,"Be Careful, I Drive Like You","Perhaps you've seen the bumper sticker that both warns and accuses: Be Careful, I Drive Like You.I think Apropos is an attempt to say, ""Be careful, this protagonist acts like you."" Apropos, the real you, is not a high-minded, noble hero, but someone looking out for number one. You might accept his sort of world-weary character in a hard-boiled detective novel: a loser that ""ain't taking no chances for nobody else,"" but saves the girl against his better judgment. Well, here he is in a fantasy setting. But his utter lack of virtue might put you off. ""Of course I'd save the maiden,"" you say. But would you? Would you really? Or, ""I'd never do anything like that to a friend!"" Never? Not for anything?Makes you wonder."
2,I won't buy the sequels,"Sir Apropros of Nothing seems to start like a fantasy parody. That's what the cover indicated, at least. In the mood for a silly jaunt, I picked it up.But there are actually two books here. One is a hilarious satire of most epic fantasy novels. The other is a serious depiction of a clubfooted young man, conceived when his mother was raped, physically abused, mistreated, and maligned.I feel like someone mixed Victor Hugo with Dave Barry. If the book had just been serious, or just been silly, it would be excellent. As it is, we have discussions of Sir Umbrage of the Flaming Nether Regions amidst tales of a childhood upbringing that makes you want to weep. The combination doesn't work."
4,Not your typical fantasy story,"This book was not what I expected. I expected satire, bad puns and good writing, all of which I got. I expected a tone similar to Peter David's Knight Life, instead I got something...I almost want to say darker, but I'm not sure if that's the right word for it. Grittier, perhaps? The plot went in directions I never expected.The main character, Apropos, is a poor son of a prostitute who has been told all of his life that he has a destiny. He is mean-spirited and nasty and rarely does anything that doesn't help him in some way. He is very different from your typical fantasy hero.All in all, it's quite entertaining to see him get in and out of various adventures and turn the typical high fantasy adventure on its ear. We learn quite a bit about Apropos and quite a few plot lines are wrapped up, but there are a few tantalizing bits that make you want to read the further adventures of Apropos."
4,"Definitely Good, but...","I loved the wit and pacing of this novel; it definitely kept mereading, and some turns were brilliant. Overall, definitely a good read and highly recommended for anyone who has any interest in both fantasy and Monty Python/Princess Bride style tales. However, it has flaws. Sometimes the humorous tones conflicts with the serious ones, and they cancel each other out rather than adding to one another, making it impossible to commit to any one strong feeling..."
4,"A fun and funny read, yet also poignant","The book is a lot of fun and the character is very interesting, a likable antihero who does some pretty devious things to his fellow ""good guys"" until his chance at redemption. The puns get tiresome, but the story keeps you hooked. My one complaint was that the book starts in media res. I would recommend reading chapters 2 to 11, then chapter 1, then 12 to the end. I wound having to reread chapter 1 when I got to the place it fit."
3,shoulder support...,i like the concept... the material is great quality... the fit is off....alittle small.getting into this support was painful! need an extra pair of hands.
5,Definetly A Keeper!,"This is one of the episodes from the first season and is getting harder and harder to get! Not only is it great to sit down and watch with the kids, it's a great addition to any ""Dukes"" fan's collection! A MUST!"
5,TO ME IT IS ONE OF THE BEST TV SHOWS OF ALL TIME,"I would like to see complete sets for every season of this tv show on DVD because it is not enough to have 9 episods only for any of the dukes of hazzard fans, I wont be satisfied until I see all the of THE DUKES OF HAZZARD episodes, and I think all of THE DUKES OF HAZZARD fans all over the world think the same way."
2,"Seven Sins: Jewish and Christian, and Classical Reflections on Human Psychology","I purchased the book upon a strong recommendation by my philosophy book club members. The book was an easy read, but I was very disappointed in the dry and mundane writing. It was apparent that the author was not fully familiar with classical philosophers other than Seneca, Augustine, and Aristotle. His ""reflections"" were primarily a comparison of what he considered to be significant differences between Jewish and Christian beliefs on sin and vice. While the author may be a very effective counselor in his arena, he is not very well informed of recent studies on the neurophysiology of moral behavior. While reading, I often felt that I was sitting through yet another boring religious sermon. I did not learn anything new that I had not learned in Catholic school almost 60 years ago."
2,Really Disappointing,"The EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark has become almost indispensible while playing the game. I expected this book to be an update or revision, instead it is a supplement. Only new spells are addressed here, and the only maps are of new areas. I had hoped to retire my old book and just use the new one. Instead, this one will not get much use at all, and the old manual will continue to be well used."
3,Better than people think,I like prima strategy guides. Most people say they are worthless and you can find the same info on the net for free. This is true. But I much rather have a guide in hand that I can refer to while in game. I still find the old Kunark guide has alot of valuable info in it and I still use it. The Shadows of Luclin guidebook is not a complete guide. It is an addendum to the previous Kunark guide. Which means I have to flip through 2 books to get the info i'm after. This was frustrating to me because I wanted one up to date guide with all the info. I feel this should have been priced lower than other prima guides.
2,Non-Christians shouldn't bother,"This is a pleasant book but the protagonist doesn't do a whole lot except hang out and proseletyze. His faith is strong and when attacked and nearly dead, waits to hear God's words before dying. He is judgmental which I don't find endearing regardless of faith or lack thereof. The only women that are treated kindly are those that are already devout, the rest are confused, jealous, fickle, fornicators or worse.Things move at a slow pace without the unpredictability of everyday life. But since there aren't a whole lot of Christian mysteries and I can imagine devout Christians not being happy with some of the debasement of other humans found in so many mysteries these days, this should be just up their alley."
1,A Angry Person,I ordered the Play Arts Tidus from this seller and got the trading arts Tidus. I am very ticked off right now. This was false advertisement. He doesn't bend he is about 4 inches smaller than the play arts Tidus. I am simply very pissed.
2,Even more Disappointing that CCNA 3,"I have to say that although the first two books in the CCNA Companion Guide series were good (CCNA 1 Networking Basics and CCNA 2 Routers and Routing Basics), each being 400-500+ pages long with detailed information, the last two companion books (CCNA 3 Switching Basics and Intermediate Routing and CCNA 4 WAN Technologies) have been stripped down to 200+ pages each but still at the same price as the first two!This is in stark contrast to the actual course material which can be seen in the CCNA ICND self study book is much more rigorous and detailed than the CCNA Intro self study book. This tells me that the 3,4 companion guides should also be much more detailed in order to prepare the candidate adequately.I'm not certain if the above review used the first two books but they were much better.Not worth the money."
1,CAUTION,"This item is listed as ""UNDERSTUDY CAST"" but is not actually a cast recording at all. It is ""Hilights from HAIR"" by the Countdown Singers and Orchestra. Didn't bother listening to it."
4,Pretty un Game,"This will be short, the game is fun but I think personally if you don't have any cheats codes or a game shark the game would be extremly hard and frustrating."
2,Nowhere near my expectations,"Army Men 3D is just no good. It's fun at first, but the graphics are nowhere near the Playstation's ability, the multiplayer is boring, and the controls are bad. This game needed more polishing. Steer clear, but if you've got an N64, Sarge's Heroes is great."
2,NOT THE BEST GAME,"This game could be a lot better. For one, the game play is terible. You can barly control the guy. And something else that bothers me is that you can't aim with the guns. When you finaly do hit the guy you have no amo left. I have had this game for a while and it is my least favorite. I've seen better games from 3DO. Trust me, DO NOT WAIST THE CASH!"
1,No Tie,Took paul fredrick 2 weeks to discover they were out of stock. Now I have no tie for a very special event. Thanks paul
5,I LOVE this lotion!,"This lotion is fantastic! It smells amazing, and it leaves my skin smooth & smelling delicious. It absorbs quickly & isn't sticky-feeling at all. Another benefit, it doesn't make my skin break-out, so I assume it's safe for anyone with sensitive, acne-prone skin."
4,An awesome read!,I had to read this for my Scandinavian history class and I am very pleased with this book. It's fascinating to find out what happened with the Greenland and North American settlements by the early Icelandic peoples. My only complaint is that the book spends too much time on geneology rather than historical facts.
5,LOVE Charles Napier's acting!!!!,"Was a friend of Charles' in college and when he told us during ""What're You Gonna' Be When You Graduate""discussions in the Student Union snack shop..he would say and we would laugh everytime!!! ""I'm going to Hollywoodand be a Movie Star!!!"" He got the last laugh on us all!!!!"
4,Pretty darn funny but rough around the edges,"This collection includes a couple of really good episodes like ""Jet Assisted Chevy"" and ""Escape from Alcatraz."" It seems to be older episodes, though. Adam and Jamie's personalities don't shine through as much as they do on recent shows, and the flow is awkward at some points. Nevertheless, a good buy and full of Myth Busters' typical hilarious predicaments."
4,ALWAYS FUN,Always fun to watch Jamie & Adam blow stuff up. Music from the first couple of episodes is AWFUL - thank goodness they found something to replace it with!
5,Dsvid Jack!,My son grew up on David Jack! Now I am buying a gift for a cousins child and she loves music so I am sending them David. I was a PTA president and David was the best assembly we ever had. WE also would go to Sesame Place and see David perform. I am so glad that this is available.
4,Strong Women,"I like the strong female characters of all races and cultures. Also, I got good visual of characters and locations because of good descriptive writing."
3,The formatting for Kindle not very good,The story was not bad. The hero is Hispanic which is unusual in the romance genre. But the ebook version has numerous formatting errors and misspelled words. If that bothers you then be forewarned.
2,1600 For Men Total Body Powder,"Smells good, but it's too clumpy. It will not sprinkle out the small holes, I have to dump a pile in my hand and go from there."
2,Not what I was looking for,I was optimistic this product would take care of my needs. Odor and wetness can be a problem for any guy. Having a good body powder can make a tremendous difference in anyones day.The first time I tried this product I was in shock. It has a nice light scent but that is about it. Applying the powder actually makes me feel worse. It seems as though this powder balls up and sticks to the skin. This can making walking or any body movement uncomfortable.I would not recommend this product to anyone. This powder does not do the job...
4,Back to Basics,"During the political season, it seems well to consider what kind of country we were from the outset. Reflecting on the Federalist Papers gives us some perspective on the careful, even laborious groping for a balanced constitution, and a chance to read Jay, Hamilton, and Madison in their original voices. A good, sober antidote to the senseless campaign ads of 2012. We see the development of the power balance between the executive and the legislative branches."
2,not what was promised,"The quality of this product was not what I expected. Mine did not have the cutting board, but instead two drawers. Also, and this is more my mistake for not paying closer attention to the measurements, but once assembled the cart stands about two and half feet, which is an awkward height to be at (and I am a short person). I will say that it is cute though, just not the most functional product."
1,Safety,"I bought this because it looked so comfy, but my husband and I took the car seat to our local fire station to make sure we had installed it correctly and were told that these were not recommended because they interfere with the harness. The kind that go completely over the carriers are recommended. We returned ours. Safety first."
1,not safe!,"I bought several versions of the Bundle Me only to find out today that they should not be used because they go under the baby and interfere with the way the safety straps fit! I am so frustrated by this! Why are they allowed to sell products that are not safe??? We took our car seat to the Katie Cares Safety Check today and they took all of the accessories off. We had a neck support cozy on the seat as well that they said was also unsafe. Save your money and buy a version that goes OVER the seat and baby, not under... Kidopotomus makes one."
5,Fantastic item! Best gift for babies in cold weather!,"This was something given to me at a baby shower, and ended up the one item I tell everyone about! It is just fantastic! I loved how easy it was to put in my infant carrier (by Graco) and even easier it was to put my daughter in when she was newborn. SO convenient for New England winters! I never had to worry about other buntings - just a hat! I even bought her the Bundle Me Big when she outgrew the infant carrier to use in her stroller."
4,Originqal Bundle Me,"This is a MUST HAVE for any baby in an infant carrier in the cold weather! Five years ago we would have to put a warm coat on our son and strap him in his carrier, then take his coat off during long trips when he would get too hot. Now with our daughter we just put her in her seat and zip up the Bundle Me and we are off. I am the original ""over dresser"" with my children and I can honestly say that she is always warm even in the below zero temperatures we experience. When she gets warm on long trips we just unzip the top of the Bundle Me bag. Cleaning is a breeze and you never have to take the carrier straps off to re-install it. A warm hat and the Bundle Me is all your baby needs for the cold weather trips. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the lining is not wearing well near the foot area. Overall- a great purchase!"
2,great idea but to hot for car,I got this for my baby shower for my 2nd baby girl who is now 6 months old. She was born in September. I put this on her infant seat as soon as it got very cold. She was such a good baby but when I put her in the car she would scream and cry. I thought she hated being in the car intill my sister was riding with me and was trying to calm her down and said she is hot and I did not have the bundle top on it so she was just sitting on it. I decided to take it off and try to see if that was the problem and sure enough to this day she loves the car. If you are going outside on a cold day this is great but in the car it gets way to hot for them. :)
4,Wonderful,"Solved my problems of finding blankets to cover my newborn in the car seat. I have a Graco SnugRide car seat and this just went on to the car seat with a elastic band. It is a wonderful product. A little costly, but I plan to buy the fleece cover for the warmer months. This cover is so snuggly. She falls asleep in the car seat! No more blankets needed."
1,This item is NOT safe for use in carseats!,"This item can re-route the harness straps on your carseat, causing extra slack. It is also bulky, which in itself adds slack. If you feel that you need a cover other than blankets over your infant's carseat, PLEASE get one that just goes over the baby, not under.Also, the baby in the picture is much too tall for an infant carrier."
4,Warm and Cozy,This is a great product for fall or winter babies if you live in a cold climate. It does away with bulky snowsuits which are inconvenient as well as unsafe. This is easy to use with any infant car seat. It allows baby to stay warm when needed and unzips easily when he/she does not without disturbing him/her. A must have for any cold weather baby!!!
2,Not anywhere as good as I had hoped,"Its sort of hard to give a really bad review to a mug, but this is it.... Pros:The cup is a nice shape and good materials, with a easy grip and nice color.Cons: The base of the cup is impossible to fit your hand in to clean. Water gets behind the pink gel at the base. For some reason the fluids don't come out once you get half way through???Overall, a decent price for a less than average mug."
2,Poor Heat Retainment,I bought this to hold hot tea for my first class of the morning. In about half an hour the liquid becomes noticably cooler and in an hour it is lukewarm. This mug failed to meet my only standards-which are keeping my tea hot. I would suggest spending a little extra to buy a covered thermus.
2,It leaks,It leaks it leaks it leaks it leaks it leaks 18 words required so here's one more time it leaks.
1,Mug LEAKS,"We decided to order all new travel coffee mugs and ordered a wide variety, including two of this Copco Thermal Travel Mug (one in this pink and one in gray). We are extremely dissatisfied with these mugs. BOTH leaked where the mug changes from stainless to the plastic edge and then again about (less than) an inch higher where you screw the cover on. Let's just say, on my way to work, in the car, I ended up with coffee dripped on me from this mug - not too happy. Tested the other one when i got home to see if it was an isolated incident, and it was not - both mugs leaked in similar places."
1,Water seeped in after FIRST wash!,"had a set of grey ones and bought the pink for another family member. during first run in the dishwasher, water seeped in between the pink plastic and the metal liner, and there is no way to get it out. after three runs through the dishwasher, there was so much trapped water that we had to throw the mugs away. i encourage you to choose another product."
4,Nice little travel mug,"This mug works great! I love a mug that has a handle! This mug really keeps things hot and cold. It's hard to clean though.. I can't get my hand in the mug to clean out the coffee stains. And, by sink washing, water has gotten between the pink plastic shell and the silver mug underneath, and now I can see water through the plastic shell, and no way to get it out. Otherwise, it still works, but I'm afraid because of the moisture trapped between those layers, soon it will start to smell mildewy and I'll have to throw it away."
4,Version 2.0 just as good as the first,"I'm on the second one of these mugs, the first got left at an airport by accident. The mug may look a little bit like a traffic cone but the don't let that turn you off. The lid fits nice and tightly, there are no drips or leaks when you drink. The same goes for the seal on the drink hole opening. I can put this thing full of hot coffee in the bottle cage on my bike and no hot coffee flys out when I hit a bump on my commute to work. Finally, The inside is stainless steal so there's no plastic taste to your coffee. Buy one, the environment will thank you."
4,RFun for many ages and small enough to easily transport,"My 5 month old is amused by the sounds and lights, fits perfectly on bumbo tray or highchair. We recently were with children 18 months to 10 years and they all took a turn playing. Great value for less than $[...]"
5,My son loves this toy!,"My 2-year-old absolutely loves this toy. He got it originally as a 1st Christmas present and he completely wore it out! Now, I've purchased a 2nd one for him and he continues to enjoy it to this day."
3,Piano,"Has lots of different instrument sounds (e.g. drum, piano, trumpet, etc.) Insert cards and interaction are a little advanced for the young ones but they all like to bang on the keys"
3,Turn It Down Please,"I start with the minuses...this toy is too loud, even on the low volume setting. Also, I don't like switching the tab inserts. They are too easily misplaced or damaged. They are made of a durable plastic, but my 7 month old baby prefers to chew on them and crumple them (with alot of effort). However, she loves the music and can follow the light of keys. My 5 year old enjoys taking this toy from his sister and playing with it too -- not always in the way intended. This is an upgrade from Leapsters first learning piano, so the next version will probably be a big hit!"
2,disappointing,"Surprisingly lacking for a leapfrog toy. This truely is nothing more than a plastic lump of blinking noise. There is nothing my child can learn from this toy and he gets frustrated when he tries to play with it, as he (and I) expect it to do something more than spit out the same, single ear-splitting song over and over again.Only one of the 3 cards actually do anything and that still isn't much. The most I hear of this toy is from the bottom of the toy box, when the other toys accidently end up pushing the buttons, as they get piled ON TOP of it.You can spend your $20 on something more effective. It won't be hard to find."
1,"Disposable if the ""cards"" become damaged.","This is a fun toy, however if the discs get lost (or chewed up by a dog or toddler) you are out of luck. No way to get replacement parts. My son enjoyed this toy, however by the time it got to my daughter (3 years later) only one stage card was in tact. At most this is a disposable toy. You can find a better option w/o removable parts."
4,Grab this little gem on sale!,I just saw this in the movers and shakers. Great price! My daughter has had this since she was about 6 months (now 2). She loves music so we might be a touch biased but she is still playing with it. Very durable and the batteries seem to last and last. 18 months and I don't think I've had to change them at all. For those concerned about noise it does have a volume control with two settings. We like it fine on the lower volume.
5,AMERICAN BEAUTY,"Thanks to DuPont, American Federal Furniture is now much appreciated, and is some of the most expensive period furniture in the world. It's hard to fathom, that not long ago this type of furniture was not coveted at all, it was thought too austere and understated, the wealthy in the ninetenth century and early twentieth century wanted all things French, thankfully they finally came to their sences and now this style is considered one of the most beautiful. John Townsend was a master of the style, along with John and Thomas Seymour and Duncan Phyfe. This book does a wonderful job of highlighting his best work and the text is highly informative and the writing scholarly. If you have any appreciation for great craftsmanship or just love American Federal Furniture, then I have no doubt you will love this book."
1,Not science if it cannot be replicated,"Several recent studies have tried to replicate the results of Dr. Price's research. None of them have done so. Replication is what makes something science, if it cannot be replicated, it is not science. Dr. Price's research may or may not have been valid when it was done in the early part of the 20th century when dental equipment was crude and techniques were primitive, but here in the 21st century, Dr. Price's research does not appear to apply to modern endodontics. Not that I'm in a hurry to get a root canal anytime soon!"
3,Hardline Number Kit,This kit works well for the intended purpose. Choose them because of the background color (white) and they compliment the overall appearance.
1,A huge disappointment,"I am a fan of Balogh, but this is below her usual high standards! The hero of the novel, Nigel ""Nige"" Wetherby is ""slender,"" with perfectly curled and powdered hair tied in a satin bow. Following this description is the prompt assurance that he is not effete! Despite assurances, however, Nigel fails to excite one's imagination. He is a wimpy character, totally lacking in the usual masculine epithets such as strong, muscular, tall, etc. I found myself hoping that he would not claim the attentions of the fair Casandra. But alas, that is the whole point of this book! Further, though Balogh attempts to remain true to the time-period by using Regency-type vernacular, she over-uses certain expressions. Each page has either a Cor-Blimey, Zounds, La or I'faith. The lack of variation and uninspiring hero make for a cumbersome and monotonous read."
1,canoli shells for the ages,These shells were to old to use .there is no way i would serve them to company.I recieved 12 boxes of them after checking many boxes none of them were usable.I dont think there is any way to insure that the shells are fresh.Never again.
4,Try it,"This is what I have been looking for. Once you put it on, you don't have to worry about your nipples showing thur your clothes. But the good part is that it is reusable."
4,Lakota Surrenter,"Book was well written, believable to the time period, and showed the honor of the Native American Indian and the plights of their survival again the Whites."
3,It was okay,"I admit that I read this ebook because I was intrigued. The plot, pacing and Tahiska kept me going even though there were times I find myself in circles because of Kristina. I can't decide whether I like her character or not. But the portrayal of her parents, her best friend and the Indians were convincing. I stayed up late at night just to have that assurance that Tahiska gets the happy ending he so deserves. But this story definitely made an impact, in that, I have a greater appreciation on the culture of the Lakota Indians more than ever."
3,boring,"I found this book to be tedious and predictable.While reading it, I found myself skimming the pages to see if the story became a bit more adventurious but to my disapointment, it did not."
5,"This is a wonderful book that you cant even put down...,","Tahiska and Kristina, an Indian warrior and a white woman...They fell in love..This is a great story...and my 4th book of Karen Kay...She is a great writer.... I enjoyed reading her books...If you like this one, then you must read her other books... they are GREAT!! =)PS: The reviewer from Arcadia, CA is me, I have moved to Norway!"
5,Truly touched by the love of an Indian and his wife.,Truly touched by the love of an Indian and his wife.The honor that the young Indian showed to the young woman in this story was heart warming and deeply touched. The lengths he would go to show his love and preparing her for a life with him really stood out the most. Understanding her even if their cultures was different.The strong characters of the Indian brave and his companions against the back drop of prairie life and seeking revenge for the murder of his father kept me glued to the book.A father who had to admit the truth.A young willful woman who defies her upbringing and culture to be with her heart made this a wonderful romance.A book I enjoyed extremely.
3,Lakota Surrender,I liked some parts of the book but in some places it was real slow. I would recommend this book if you like stories of the indians.
4,Everything a Kindle Freebie Should Be!,"I rarely write reviews on here. Let's face it, there is usually more than enough praise and criticism for books on here. However, I enjoyed this story so much I wanted to post something. This book was everything a kindle freebie should be. I found the story to be incredibly romantic. The story was well written. The author did a great job of painting a picture for me while I read. I found I did not want to put this one down and have already looked up this author's other books. I definitely plan to read more.Also, I see now that the book is $3.03.....still worth every penny. :)"
1,Politically correct no romance novel,"This book was ridiculous. It was not a romance, but a badly done political essay on how wonderful Indians are and how horrible the white man is/was with a few minor exceptions for those whites who also feel the Indians are better than they are. Please. I will never read this author again."
5,Cassie Bernell,Cassie Bernell is the best and i wish the best for her in heaven and hope the heavenly father will take care of her.
1,"It's a myth, nothing more, she never said ""yes"".","I strongly recommend that anyone who sees this movie consider it fiction. As more and more evidence is showing, it was the person next to Cassie that said ""Yes"", not Cassie herself. If you want to see a movie that shows how a young woman was emotionally abused by her parents ""tough love"" philosophy before she was tragically and senselessly slain, get it. If you want inspirational stories of faith, you're better off reading C.S. Lewis, than seeing this sad attempt to capitalize on this poor young woman's death. Her parents should be ashamed of themselves, but they're too busy selling their daughter's fictional ""martyrdom"" to those willing to believe this fiction over the truth."
2,"Good book, but don't get the Kindle Edition","There are multiple editions of this book, my comment specifically refers to one of the Kindle Editions:Dive into PythonBriefly: don't get the Kindle edition. The point of Dive Into Python is to dive into code, presenting examples and discussing the examples. The Kindle edition is fatally flawed, in that the majority of the code is misformatted - it is wrapped into paragraphs is if it were text. This makes the code examples nearly unreadable, and they're the whole point of the Dive into Python book."
1,"""Zero care"" applied to printing","This is one of those ""print on demand"" books. These folks are are simply providing the service of printing and binding: but they have done it badly. Section marker symbols (like (!)) are not to the left of the text, but about halfway in the middle of the page. Gray and colored text is made of of difficult to read dot patterns. Basically it looks like it was printed on a cheap laser printer at 150 dots per inch. It is lower quality than a typical home laser printer, and with the section symbols blocking the text, very hard to read. Also it is advertised as the ""2009"" edition, but is really the 2004 edition. And never mind the cheap cover and poor paper: those I expected. Overall unacceptable, I will be returning the item and purchasing the professionally printed 2004 edition used.For the original book, and free license terms, see diveintopython.org"
1,didn't care for it - not for programming newbies,"I have experience with Fortran, some C/C++, but mostly IDL, a commercial scripting language for scientific visualization. I'm interested in Python because its an open source scripting language.At the very least, skim the free online version before buying it. I got a copy from a friend and found it tough going. The first chapter 'dives' right into dictionaries and I didn't find it clear at all. Didn't make it past the first 2 or 3 chapters before looking for something else. The visual layout could also be better."
1,theory based,just download it. the document is pretty much free on the internet. There aren't alot of good examples to base the language off of
4,good dive,nice examples to dive into and get a whole view of the language in very short time. but not recommended for newcomers in programming.
3,A good old fashioned B-rated horror movie,"I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this movie. I was expecting it to be a typical low budget horror schlock fest, but it ended up making me jump a couple of times and wondering in the end whether it was all real or just the main character's imagination.The FX are Syfy TV style but this movie is 10 years old. The low par FX are made up by a solid performance by Karl Urban (pre all his now big hits) and Katie Wolfe. Karl keeps the pace moving and does a good job keeping us teetering on the edge of insanity aptly provided by Katie Wolfe.I grew up watching a lot of B grade horror films so I consider myself to be a fairly reliable critic of this genre. A good B grade horror flick has humor, cheesiness, a hunky hero, just enough scare to make you jump a couple of times, and a gratifying denouement. The Truth About Demons offers all of that. I definitely recommend it."
2,truth about demons,"This movie was totally dumb.if you like boring freaks and demons that look like punkin head and kill without gore,be my guess watch thie stupid waste of money movie."
1,Falls several million sandwiches short of a picnic,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought,""Hey, that looks like it could be funny!"" Yeah, it COULD HVE BEEN FUNNY! This movie was a huge disappointment, and what makes it even more frustrating is that it COULD HAVE BEEN a great movie. The idea of some guy who can't speak English being stuck in a airport is funny. But they took the idea and mutated it into a half-hearted attempt at a love/conspiracy! Don't buy it!"
1,Why oh WHY does everything have to have a hollywood ending?,"This movie has a really nice concept. The whole story behind it is really good. A guy who while on the plane technically 'loses' his country and has no valid passport therefore he cannot leave the terminal or go back! Thats an interesting story to make a movie out of, quite original.....But then you add up all the Hollywood cliches, romantic stuff that NEVER happen, like people who never met getting married cause they are touched by each other (yeah right!!!! ), the whole terminal falling in love with Tom Hanks because they are touched by him.... I mean.... GET REAL!!!! Its NEW YORK and its 2004!!!!You either make a really soppy and cheasy movie and appeal to a cetrain audience that love to go 'OOhhhhhh' every 5 mins or make an interesting or serious movie and appeal to another kind of audience. Dont do both! THEY DONT MIX.And didnt quite get WHY it had to be THAT long of a movie....It had nice laughs but....NAhhhhhhhh"
1,Surprisingly bad,"Who thought Catherine Zeta-Jones and Tom Hanks could be in a movie that isn't just bad, but downright awful. Tom Hanks plays an refugee stuck in JFK. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the flight attendant he has a crush on. Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla. It just doesn't go anywhere, and the acting is terrible to boot. No plot. No storyline. No good characters. No depth or meaning. No reason to see it."
1,THIS MOVIE GAVE ME A TERMINAL ILLNESS!,"Could this movie be any more stupid! Why would you use Tom Hanksfor this stupid movie, everyone on this planet knows he speaksperfect English! It's hard to believe Spielberg would directsuch trash too. I should have listened to my friends, who saidthis movie sucked, they were 100% on the money!"
5,Great movie,Received the dvd quickly and in good condition. This is a funny movie. It highlights the ridiculous red tape that has become so common in our lives! God bless
4,Buy This -- Very Enjoyable,"A delightful, albeit implausible, story that will lift your spirit. Strong performances by Hanks & Tucci. Many movie critics were disappointed. What were they expecting -- another Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List???? Not Academy Award material, but a solid 4 stars."
2,ho-hum,"I enjoyed this movie when it came out on the big screen, so I looked forward to buying it on DVD and watching all the extras. However, I was actually a bit disappointed with them - there was a lot of technical stuff like Spielberg discussing the size of the set etc... but not as much behind-the-scenes footage of the actors as I had hoped there would be. The 3-disc version is not worth buying as the third disc is the movie soundtrack, and it's not that impressive. Overall I still enjoyed watching the movie again, but the extras are not really worth investing in - my advice: just buy the one-disc movie."
2,nothing classic,"Stanley Tucci often plays the man you love to hate: annoying, shady, demanding. Here he is no different and though Tom Hanks is the main character, Tucci's character is central to what happens to Hanks. This is a rather lighthearted flick about a man living indefinitely in an airport when his visa is determined invalid because a coup in his home country leaves him stateless. But because of violence in his home country, flights to return there have been suspended. He is stuck in the airport for god only knows how long. Tucci is determined to somehow drive him out; he does not want him living in his airport, and he would rather that Hanks make a run for it, so he could become the responsibility of the immigration authorities, but in the end, Hanks's character stays put, adapting, learning English, finding ways to eat and stay alive, even finding a job. Basically everyone here is normal, nothing exceptional about this film."
2,Soundtrack is NOT complete.,"Loved the movie, could care less about John Williams but the jazz was cool. Got the DVD with the ""soundtrack"" all Mr. Williams and no jazz. FIY Benny Golson trio. Buy the movie Not the 3 disc set you will be dissapointed. I was."
1,"ridiculous plot, bad acting, sad characters",The plot does not make any sense at all. None of the characters is truly developed. What we know about the characters is that most of them are sad and decadent people. Most of the jokes are bad. Not worth 2 cents.
1,I didn't know Spielburg knew how to make a bad movie,"Spielburg has finally made a bad movie, and I mean a real stinker. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. Have you ever been stuck in an airport? If so, you've experienced the boredom and depression that is ""The Terminal"". Tom Hanks plays the least compelling protagonist I've ever seen in a movie; by the end, I just didn't care what happened to him.Leaving the theatre, I wasn't the only one shaking my head in disappointment. That's two hours of my life that I'll never get back. If you must see this because of Spielburg and Hanks, do yourself a favor and wait to rent the DVD."
3,Good Flick,Speilberg is not capable of making a bad movie. It's just not in the realm of this Universe' possibilities. Tom Hanks does a great job of playing a sympathetic foreigner who turns out to be a hero. Catherine Zeta Jones breaks his heart ofcourse but in the end her character is just in it for the cash like most of the rest of us. There's also a jazz theme to the flick which tells me Speilberg is a jazz fan. An even better but underated Speilberg flick is A.I.. This flick is not quite up to that standard but still worth a few viewings especially if you strongly relate to underdogs.
2,Cancel Your Reservation,"Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are NOT Jacques Tati, who would have turned this one-joke premise into a cinema classic. Stanley Tucci remains the only bright spot in a painfully contrived serio-comedy. Despite good intentions, ""The Terminal"" never takes flight."
3,"It is Average, but I Liked It","The Terminal is about a man (Tom Hanks), stuck in an Airport Terminal for months because his passport was denied by US customs. He eventually finds a way of surviving and working in this environment whilst seeking his way out. The plot is ludicrously ridiculous but entirely engaging. The Indian airport cleaner is a 'scream' and both he and Hanks both hold this movie together...There are enough sub-plots here to keep you occupied throughout...It was never going to win an oscar, and is a very average movie but nevertheless, I've seen worse and I enjoyed it."
2,TERMINALly bad.,"Not all that well made, probably speilberg's worst. Its funny, has alittle drama, but no heart wrenching stuff, not an overly interesting story (then again how good could a movie be about aguy who lives in an airport), good performances but even the master Tom Hanks isnt gonna get an oscar, a nom at most, but i doubt it. See Saving Private Ryan for speilbergs best work, and Forrest Gump for Tom's. 3 out of a 10."
1,Huge Mistake for Hanks,"Normally, I think Tom Hanks makes some great films....but this was a disaster of a role.The movie was one of the worst I've seen in a while."
1,"Wow, that was bad",While watching it I was unsure if it was trying to be a comedy or a drama. There were parts that you could tell were supposed to be funny and there were parts that were supposed to be dramatic but fell flat. Every joke revolved around Hanks' character not being able to speak English very well. All the dramatic moments revolved around pretty much the same thing.What really makes the movie horrible was the completely nonsensical plot. Almost every plot point is ridiculous and can be greeted with a big WTF?
1,"Easily, Spielberg's Worst Movie","This movie proves that even a brilliant director like Steven Spielberg and two Hollywood mega-stars like Hanks and Zeta-Jones cannot save a (very) lousy screenplay. Although the movie is not meant to be realistic - the sheer implausibility of the story, the shallowness of the characters and the cliched sub-stories - makes you squirm in your seat, waiting for the roughly 2 hour movie to end.One interesting fact - an entrire terminal has been constructed for the purpose of the film - that's quite impressive as a movie set but that's about the only thing impressive in this movie."
1,"Pretty silly, bordering on stupid",I usually like Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones but this movie was just plain silly; although Stanley Tucci did a great job playing a sad sleaze. I couldn't wait for the movie to end and was tempted to just stop watching it but I had already invested time into it.
3,Fantasy!,"A bit of a diversion, a fantasy if you will. Are people (supervisors) working in the Immigration Service really as mean as all that . . . I hope not . . . and he was MEAN, real mean. What was his problem with Viktor? The love interest . . it was hard to see why she would gravitate toward him in any way, one of the most beautiful 39 year olds you will ever see . . but then I am sure that there are many women out there leading such difficult aimless lives, although I doubt that they would look like her. Lots of schmaltz, particularly when Viktor came in contact with the Russian . . . no sex, no bad language (hardly any), no violence . . . at least that was something positive about this movie."
5,Superb,"I very much enjoyed this movie, a friend of mine told me about it so I thought I would check it out. He said it was about a guy stuck in a airport terminal ok at first I thought 'yawn' but to my surprose it was very good. Is should have known it would be. I've never disliked a Tom Hanks movie yet. I suggest renting and even buying this one."
4,it was was good not the usual ending,"i give this 3and a half stars really. i liked it it was funny, but was surprised me was the ending the trailer made it look like a romantic comedy, but it was funny but no romance. at the end he doesnt stay with the girl which i thought was good and realistic.Because in real life you dont always get the girl of your dreams like in all these movies with happy endings.i will not tell you what the movie is about cause everybody already has plus you must have seen the trailer. go see it if you accept reality. Life doesnt always end how you want it too. Li"
3,Sweet - like when you put to much sugar in your coffee,"GREAT actors, and producer, but just an average movie overall.I would discribe this movie as 'sweet' - like when you put to much sugar in your coffee, you will drink it because you paid for it.Rating: Maybe buy it used"
3,Another American remake,So the film is loosely based on a true story of a guy who spent years at Paris Charles de Gaulle aiprort (yes years not months). The film has zero to do with this guy who we met about 7 years ago when travelling back home after a meeting.Why oh why does Hollywood have to rewrite history an Americanize it? Why does the rest of the world hold the US in disdain - exactly because they steal other people stories and ruin them.2nd film this week that didn't follow the tryuth or the book - Bourne Supermacy!
1,Hanks Is Entitled To A Mistake Now And Again,"Hanks does his best to make this obtuse flick watchable, but little can be done as the screenplay is such dreck it would give Aaron Spelling a sugar high. Nothing about this ridiculous mess is believable except for the government slackers (excuse the redundancy) doing nothing for the main character. I wish Steven Spielberg would stop making films. He is so overrated. Discriminating people will find no value in this film. People with little capacity to differentiate will find it entertaining. Don't waste your time."
1,One of the worst Speilberg movies I saw!,I saw this opening weekend with my friend and we didn't like it at all. Tom Hanks has the worst acting in this movie and his character was really annoying even his accent. The character he played everyone hated him and they were all rejecting him a bunch of him not to leave the terminal and at the end he finally left but he had to stay in a Terminal for years which is wrong but still I did not like this movie. My friend and I were ready to walk out of theater and we also got our money back too. I even almost fell asleep during the film. The only scene that I thought was funny was when Tom Hanks was in the bathroom with the guy and there shaving and the guy was saying something about living in a terminal or something that is so funny the rest of the movie sucked. (...)
2,"Russian accent by self is funny, yes?","There was a real ""man without a country"" who lived in a Paris airport for many years, but this movie was only loosely based on his story. What we have here is a film that could have been written using a template, something like a ""Movie-Matic"", which would include romantic subplots with a woman dating a man who's no good for her, and a few lovable but bumbling sidekick characters with amusing accents. An otherwise forgettable ""feel good"" movie is marred by the inclusion of lefty propaganda (watch for the ""Canadian pharmacy"" scene), and the entire basis for the plot plays into the childish notion that large institutions (like airports) are actually controlled by lone, capricious tyrants, rather than by a confusing array of local, state, and federal authorities. Anyone remember ""Yakov Smirnov""? You will by the time you sit through this one!"
1,Spielberg ain't no Scorcese,or Lloyd Kaufman for that matter!This film along with A.I. and Catch Me If You Can are proof of that!
4,Good movie,"For some reason I thought this was a Christmas movie. Not so much, but it definitely captures the spirit. I hadn't seen this since it was in the theatres. Good Tom Hanks movie."
4,"Good, but not Great","""The Terminal"" is a very entertaining movie, but I don't know if I can quite recommend it to buy, sight unseen. I say rent it first. Tom Hanks finds himself in a very odd situation as a man without a country (there is a coup while he is in flight) and is stuck at the internaional terminal. There are several sub-plots and of course Hanks' relationship with Catherina Zeta Jones Douglas Phi Gamma Rho. Tau. This movie I believe will be a bigger hit with the post 30 crowd more so then with the pre 30 crowd."
4,Tom Hanks Shines In The Terminal! ****1/2,"The Terminal is a great film that may not be an instant classic, but is much better than its box office or reviews show. Tom Hanks gives an amazing performance as an immigrant who, due to problems in his homeland, is stranded at JFK Airport. Hanks' genuine kindness and heart make his character one of the more likable chracters in cinematic history, and you root for him every step of the way. The supporting cast, especially the janitor and Stanley Tucci, do a great job of acting as well and Spielberg does his usual great job of directing them and the audience to a satisfying conclusion, that falls a little short of excellence. With all that being said, this film would have fared better commerically in the holiday season where it belongs, and critics may have been more kind and realized that Spielberg has always had cheesy qualities in all his films. Go See This Movie!"
5,Best Movie of 2004,I was forced to see this film instead of Dodgeball and was blown away on how much I loved it...I found myself laughing alone in the theatre while everyone else was silent....ti was fun of guiunine comedy which is what lacks anymore in our films....This can be enjoyed by anyone who has a nice clean sense of humor..Tom Hanks pulls off a great actor acheivement in this one and so does Catherine Zeta-Jones...so a very enjoyable film
5,if you like movies about people,"I must defend this movie from some of the lame reviews below. This movie is about people, a character driven story. NO there aren't any car chases and nothing blows up. But it is riveting and the performances are nothing short of excellent. I like this movie because it is so refreshingly different. It is creatively told, and who didn't love that scene with the medicine! A great story, a quiet movie, and fabulous acting. Give it a try."
3,The ending went klunk,I enjoy Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg movies in general so I went to watch this movie. Hanks was excellent as the foreigner stuck in the airport terminal. Some other movie reviewers didnt care for the reason for a canned peanut tin that he carried around during the movie but to me it seemed very old country and something a person would do for a member of his family.The supporting cast was very enjoyable but I felt that Katherine Zeta-Jones part could have been done by a lesser actress. Stanley Tucci was also good as the official in charge of the situation with Hanks characterIn all I really enjoyed the movie till the end. The movie was a little long and it seemed that the writer or director couldnt come up with a suitable end or tie up the little things and I left the movie with a feeling of disappointment.
2,"3 stars for movie, but 2 stars for dvd","In one glimpse, it's a very good movie! excellent actings, good directing and good story. but, It's not! the movie based on a true story about a persian refugee. spielberg bought his autograph, changed nationalty and... the worst part is, it's a hollywoodic movie. altough it's based on a true story, but in the middle of the film you feel it's not based on reality anymore. at least i expected more from spielberg and he dissapointed me this time!and about DVD, there is two editions, widescreen edition with no special features, and a collectors gift set with 2 dvds and cd soundtrack at the price of 35 dollars!!! now if anybody dosent want to buy cd soundtrack and want a complete dvd with regular price, what can he do? average price for a 2 disc special edition dvd is between 15 to 20 dollars, 15 bonus dollars dollars for the soundtrack? it's not worth it! but they want to force you to buy them all! that not right"
2,Interminable,"The biggest problem with this film? It goes on, and on, and on, and on.It slaps Homeland Security right in the face, literally. There are sooo many loopy things going on here that I do not even know where to start.Unfortunately, good performances from Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones and the rest of the cast can not make this turkey fly."
2,the terminal,"Victor(Tom Hanks) is a man without a country, stuck at the airport, because his country is at war and there is no official leader. Not having a country Victor is not allowed on American soil. Victor resides in Gate 57,becomes friends with various airport employees, and even finds romance with a flight attendant(Catherine Zeta Jones). Termainal is Tom Hanks movie, he is the one who keeps it watchable. The movie is overly long,while good at times overall the movie is rather slow. If it weren't for Tom Hanks this movie would be a bomb! Rent it before you buy it."
2,Easily the cheesiest movie ever...,"I really could not believe how cheesy and lame this movie was. It's level of cheesosity makes Hallmark movies look like Schindler's List. On top of that, it was extremely unrealistic and lame."
1,2 stars at most,"After the first hour, I found myself constantly checking my watch wondering how much longer I would have to sit there and when this interminable 'Terminal' would end.Tom Hanks was wonderful as always, but the situation was more in line with a half-hour sitcom than a 2 hour movie. Stanley Tucci's character was unfortunately rather one-dimensional (no fault of Stanley Tucci). It also appeared that some sections were cut because there were some lines that just didn't make sense, not to mention a wedding of two people who apparently never dated.All in all, a waste of theater bucks. Wait for it on video."
1,"Oh so long, boring and unsatisfying","This movie definitely feels longer than it is, as it continually drags through scene to scene to develop some straggly story line.It's not a love story, it's not a drama, it's not a comedy (for sure), and it's no inspiration, so what the heck is it?! Disappointing. Hanks' accent is over the top, Zeta-Jones is incidental as a stewardess and mild romantic interest (big zippo there)."
3,Great Acting In A Silly Movie,"I loved this movie for about the first 30 minutes. After that it seemed like the story didn't know where to go. While I sort of enjoyed this movie I think it had mostly to do with Tom Hanks. He creates a character that is easy to like and he does an amazing job playing a person who doesn't speak english and is trapped in an airport. What I didn't like about this movie was that it was a bit silly. The whole point of why he came to the U.S. to begin with was supposed to be touching, but I just thought it was a bit silly in the end. This movie was interesting, but a lot of it was just so far fetched that when the movie ended I just felt it was very corny overall. Entertaining enough to keep you interested, yet a let down in total."
4,Exceeded expectations,"This movie exceeded my expectations. Tom Hanks was, as he always is, brilliant. It may sound simple, but by the end I'd forgotten that Hanks was starring, because his portrayal of Viktor was so believable. The movie had its funny points, but was mainly just an interesting insight into the world of airports. It could have done without the love-plot with the fligth attendant, this was just a little far-fetched. But all in all I will definitely watch it again, and recommend it to others if asked. One of the better movies I've seen in a while."
3,Disappointing...but a flight worth taking....,"Tom Hanks continues to amaze me but Catherine Zeta-Jones isn't given much to do in Steven Speilberg's inferior Catch Me if You Can follow-up. The supporting cast is terrific, especially the underrated Stanley Tucci and Zoe Saldana,and the story is cute, but the film lacks credibility and is therefore frustrating. While it's fun to watch and pretty entertaining, the film doesn't take off quite like it should with the amazing talent involved. I was expecting a bit more. Overall, if's worth seeing, if only for Hanks Oscar worthy performance, and nothing else."
3,could have been better,"i personally love good movies that are creative and original, and i thought this one is one of them. i own the movie and i watch it from time to time, but to no extend of the imagination would i consider this movie a great movie. certainly tom hanks gave one great performance, he's indeed one of the best actors of his generation if not the best so i give him two thumbs up. Catherine zeta jones stunk up the whole movie (not surprisingly, she sucks), not that the rest of the cast was that great either."
3,Great acting average movie!,"Tom Hanks is a great actor, even in your average movie and this proves it. I didn't expect a great movie I would tell people to go buy but expected better. I think the whole storyline of the movie just wasn't quite right, and the fact that it takes place in a airport most of the movie kind of dulls it down a bit. Good buy if you are just looking for an ok comedy."
4,Pretty good,"I had never seen this until recently but its not bad. It can get alittle dull and repetetive sometimes but it'll make ya laugh, and maybe even cry... i love you Catherine zeta-jones!"
1,What Nonsense,"Ugh. Based upon a true story which is equally idiotic. The true story started not recently but in 1988; not in America's JFK Airport, but in Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France; and the real man is not a Balkan but an Iranian; and it's not the authorities who refuse to cooperate. HE refuses to cooperate. This movie sucks and I'm sorry I rented it."
1,The Terminal,"I ordered my copy from Andrewsgroup. The DVD arrived damaged, and I have had no response from Andrewsgroup, can't even get their address so I am stuck with a useless copy."
2,"Formulaic, empty, silly","There's a laundry list of what's wrong with this film, but it can be summed up in one word. Dumb. There is comedy, which is worthy of a groan or two, and little else. There is romance, but it's torpedoed by Catherine Zeta-Jones' lackluster attempt to play a romantically mixed up flight attendant with a heart of gold and deep knowledge of Napoleon (yes, you read that correctly). Not even Tom Hanks' performance--oh yes, he tries--can resurrect the superficial characterization of a man between countries and cultures, and who is meant to embody the essential goodness of mankind (apparently).This is junk food; actually, it's just junk. It's hard to watch it without concluding that you've wasted valuable time. Is it mild? Yes. Is it pleasant? I suppose in the way that music in an elevator is pleasant (I don't happen to think so). Does it accomplish anything? Resoundingly, no."
3,"Excellent movie ending in a ""thud""","Won't go into movie story as it is throughly covered by other reviews. Enjoyed movie and did not regret the time, however, like some other recent Tom Hanks movies, it has a very, probably artistic, disappointing ending. My gauge of a good movie is something that I would want to watch again but knowing the ending, I would not waste my time. Used to buy movies because of a particular actor/actors in movie but have learned to rent a movie first to see if I would enjoy watching it again."
3,I wanted to like it more...,"We picked this out as a family movie, and there wasn't anything objectionable, but there wasn't much overly redeeming either. It was a good premise that Steven Spielberg wanted to use character actors in an ensemble with Tom Hanks. It was nice that he included Catherine Zeta-Jones, but somehow the whole movie seemed contrived and long. All I could think afterward was...""this is a Steven Spielberg movie""? It felt contrived, and I thought that we might have picked another movie had we read the reviews on rottentomatoes.com. Warning: Don't buy this at full price unless you're bound and determined to have everything from Steven Spielberg or Tom Hanks."
1,Hard to believe anything about this movie,"We just watched this on DVD [and btw, the widescreen DVD has NO extra features, none] and my gosh, I didn't believe 5 minutes of it in a row. Hanks did a nice job I guess but I didn't really care what happened to the character and I couldn't suspend disbelief long enough to believe anything, and me, I believe in the starship Enterprise and my GOD if anyone else is watching ""Enterprise"" the ROMULANS are getting involved and I HATE the Romulans - so if I can't suspend disbelief, honey, pack it up and go home, that's what I say.Phooey.Although perhaps just grumpy to have lost 2 hours of my life to it, and I could have been sleeping or writing out Christmas cards or fooling around with my husband or SOMETHING else.Hanks has one really lovely moment and then there's one moment that has LOVELY MOMENT written all over it which turned me off. And I am always happy for Stanley Tucci to get a job, I guess, but still. Bah."
4,The Terminal (Widescreen Edition) ~ Steven Spielberg,"The terminal is a very good if overly long movie. It is tale about Victor Navorski who has been stranded at the airport after his country has been thrown into limbo and he is left stateless. We get to see his trials and tribulations and he shows that one can triumph over adversity and by doing so overcome any obstacles that life thrown infront of you. Tom Hanks is amazing in the role as Navorski and should have gotten the academy award that year and I have no idea why he did not get it since his portrayal is astounding and stupendous. The rest of the actors do a standup job and Catherine Zeta Jones is quite good in the role that she is given. This is a very well done movie that is quite thoughtfull, and can laugh and reflect as one watches this movie. To bad that it is a bit to long."
1,One of the worst comercials (I mean movies) ever!!!,"This movie (with Jurassic Park 2 and Demolition Man) is at the top of my list of worst movies ever. You got to love Tom Hanks, but this movie is stupid, stupid, stupid. The whole concept is inane. You are constantly bombared by product placement. You won't even like the characters. This was my conclusion just 20 minutes into the movie. I watched another 10 minutes before giving up. Stay away from this one!"
2,Is this the way to Toledo? Hello? McFly?,"So, Spielburg becomes Bertolucci, beating us over the head with the most obvious of symbols. Definite movie of the week material. It could of been better - oh who am I kidding......."
5,Different detective,"For the reader that enjoys detective books this is a must- especially if he/she prefers an historical context. Robert van Gulik, a diplomat familiar with oriental culture writes with talent and methodically- for a good detective story to be developed it is required. The only critisism that one might say is that there are some anchronisms as faras the chinese culture but they do not affect the stories. The Judge is a very intersting person that the reader sympathises with. Enjoy it."
4,Used for a college course,Good insight into Chinese detective work and cultural nuances; very different from American or British styles. Kept me interested most of the time.
4,"Straight Outta Compton shocks, moves, and jumps the reader.","If you are looking for a straight forward, easy, simple, and normal book, then put Straight Outta Compton down and walk away. When you need a shot in the arm of fast-paced, shocking, off the cuff, brilliant ""slanguage,"" then check out this book. Ricardo Cortez Cruz takes his audience through a powerful journey, a quick rapping, back alley ghetto fest. Its modern presence clashes head on with the Compton scene, and results in an unusual, yet creative and fresh look at the plight of the impoverished African American male in LA.The writing is fresh, fluid, freaky, fast, and formidable. If you need a book full of energy where the words jumps off the page and smack you in the face, then check out Straight Outta Compton by Ricardo Cortez Cruz."
2,Not my cup of tea,"While the work that went into this book was amazing and the poetry might move someone else, I did not like this book. I still admire the man who wrote it, but I did not like the book."
5,Great watch at a great price,Bought this watch for my teenage daughter to take to camp. She loves it and so do all her friends.
1,Unhappy,I made the mistake of not sampleing this book. I was not happy with the language in the first few pages and decided not to read further.
4,Highly Recommended,"I usually don't like court room stories. I'm more a private eye or police procedural typr. But I really liked this one. It gave what appeared to be a believable look at the workings of a big city DA's office (I know real big city assistant DA's are rolling their eyes at this but take a deep breath and relax). I was fully engaged by the story and liked how the author carried the story over time without losing steam. The office politics subplot was interesting and more than padding. I give 5 stars sparingly so don't take the four stars as faint praise. Find it and read it, the book is worth your while."
1,Unusable,"It is fun to watch the dog pop up, but the latch is on the outside and is very sensitive, so within minutes my toddler had figured out that you can make the dog jump out just by touching the latch -- no need to wind the toy. Then, getting the dog back in is near impossible -- even for an adult -- because you need to hold the dog inside while you close the lid on your hand. If you try to allow the lid to close on the dog without holding him down, one of his ears will get caught and the lid won't close. Plus, the lid won't close unless you finish winding to the end of the song -- how is a toddler supposed to figure that out? So, it works if I demonstrate it, but he wants to do it ""himself"" and he can't. This toy is going back to the land of nod..."
2,Jack the dog in the box,"This toy is really cute and I like how it looks, but it is too hard for a little one to use-- the crank is on the small side so it's hard for my two year old to grasp and turn it, and it is difficult to close it again- it requires a complicated two hand maneuver to stuff the dog back inside, hold the lid closed and then turn the crank at least one full turn for it to latch again. That said, the style is cool and it looks great on the shelf..."
5,Wonderful -- even for the littlest ones!,"My wife and I were amazed at how much our two year old loved this book. Three weeks after we returned our first copy to the library (and a birthday when she received about 10 new books) she was still asking for it, so we bought one. The illustrations are great, and the ""hidden"" masters paintings lying around in the scenery are a nice bit of fun for parents. The words are nicely lyrical, and this is one I never minded reading over and over."
1,hmm roller stands,they are heavy duty but do not lock hight very well.. but what do expect for the price
3,"Not like the sport... Dry, unexciting.","Got this for my son; he chose this as the source material for a Social Studies/history term paper. The history is all there. This book is full of detail; it's good in that respect. But the writing style is ponderous and makes for a slow read. Recommended for serious students of the game's history, perhaps those who are die-hard fans undertaking a master's degree in history."
5,cheap light gun game,"So as a fan of the TC series for awhile, i picked up this lil gem for about 10 bucks. was not disapointed. graphics are dated, but it gives you a fix of light gun action that the series is known for. if you have two light guns, dual gun mode is included and this game is a must. replay value is about average, how bored you get of the mmain story is your own cup of tea, but there is added minigames and so on. I reccomend this as a good buy for all ages."
1,Rip off!,"Ok I will make this review short sweet and to the point.True this game is alot of fun, forget the goncons but the major issue with this game is it only has a few major easy levels that ends the game real quickly and which made me feel completely ripped off, yes I threw good money away for this worthless game and I sold it and TC3 to my local gamestop store to make a little lunch money for my job break.Overall not worth it."
3,Great game...Mine DID come with a gun though,Mine did come with a guncon 2 gun in the box. The gun breaks really easily though. Other than that its just like the arcade game
2,Gradually induces more and more disappointment...,"Basically, if you don't have the Guncom to go with this game, the game just plain blows. If you do, it's fun for a bit, but after beating the same 3 levels over and over again, it gets verrrrry boring."
4,Two-player mode is bad,"One-player mode is great, and the extra game options are fun as well. However attempting to play the two-player mode was difficult and distracting. The screen size shrunk so small to allow for split screen, that we couldn't see clearly enough to play - and we were playing on a 36 inch screen!All in all, for a one-player shooting game, it is challenging and the graphics are good."
5,This is a fabulous game!!!,"Let me say this first: you HAVE to have a GunCon to fully enjoy the game. That said...I kicked and screamed when this game was brought into our household by my brothers. In theory, we don't buy violent games. However, I picked up the GunCon one day and ended up spending the next 6 hours beating it! It is sooo addictive and absolutely great!!! I've been converted!One small bone to pick: really contrived plot that's also amazingly short. That said, though, this game rocks!"
4,Great Game... NO GUNCON Included!!!,"This is a great arcade translation. Nothing more to add to the existing reviews. Keep in mind, though, that there are two versions of Time Crisis II. One version comes with the Guncon2, and the other does not! (...)"
3,Get the Guncon2 version!,"The game seems promising (I've only played a little), but this version of the game does NOT include the Guncon2!The local price for the game with the gun was $..., so go somewhere else and find it. The game itself will easily rate 4 or 5 stars, so get it the right way....."
4,BEST PS2 GAME EVER!...,This game is good it is the best its so cool.Not real good grafics but good lay out.The levals are not that hard and its an everyone kinda game.if you like video games you will like this and even if you didnt like shooting games you wil like this game. and a word for parents its a good game there is no reason to say i wont get this for my kid because its a bad game for kids cause its not its a good game for kids.
4,DONT BUY THIS VERSION!,"i love amazon and i dont usually harbor any resentment against a company but this is a gun game WITHOUT THE GUN! even if you have a guncon you should get the new one because it's great. i had to send this back because there was not a product description and me being simple minded assumed it would have a gun with it. the gun is only 10 bucks extra at most retailers and yet again it's such a great peripheral that you should spring the extra dough for it. if you somehow have a guncon 2 get this version, otherwise buy the version with the gun and STAY AWAY!"
3,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING,"this games is the most FUN of any of the games I've played on PS2. My wife and I just load it up and start shooting everything.Amazon drops the ball on this one, they are selling the version without the gun, and don't seem to be offering it anywhere on the site. You can't play the game without the light gun. The company does sell this game with a gun included (...) more - look for it.I didn't give it 5 stars because it's WAY to short. You'll go through all the levels the first night you have it. But it's fun, you'll go through the levels again and again."
4,cool,"From the mightiest pharaoh to the lowliest peasant,who doesn't enjoy a good light gun game?Top three reasons why this one is better than most:Time Crisis 2 rewards you for playing.Earn continues,credits,new games and more.Many arcade to home light gun titiles don't give you squat.Mini games that look like they've come from the way cool point blank series.Of course the two player cooperative play.Forget about doing this game with the CPU.Grab a friend and play this disc the way it's meant to be played.Seeing your partner on the screen working with you adds mucho fun to this style of game."
2,Disappointing,Very flimsy and not as attractive as the picture. The ribbon is not long enough for many hardcover books.
3,Not his best but better than current authors,"Lets get this straight. Frederick Forsyth is the Master storyteller. Even Masters let it slip sometimes. Avenger is a slip.This book is better than 98% of the action/fiction books out this year. But, possibly one of Forsyth's worst ever. This is the same man who gave is The Veteran & Icon in the last 5 years and absolute classics like Day of the Jackal, Dogs of War, Fourth Protocol, Negotiator & Fist of God apart from his short stories.The plot should have been a short story. The book is 80% background stories & 20% plot.To sum it up, so-so but nothing close to the Master's best work."
2,A master story teller past his prime?,"The Frederick Forsythe at his prime, as the author of Dogs of War, The Odessa File and even the more recent Fist of God is nowhere to be seen in his latest novel, Avenger.The taut pacing, complex plot, dramatic finale and telling facts on espionage are all missing in this effort. It feel more like a story that the author was mulling in his head, put it to paper without much thought to preparation, editing or coherence.The story is a sorry mix of espionage, terrorism and revenge.I read the book out of respect for all the great books Forsythe has written in the past. But perhaps now it is time to bid adieu to his newer ramblings."
2,disappointment,"AVENGER is a let-down compared to other Forsyth works. The cast of characters is large, and many of them are obviously there simply to advance the plot. Yet Forsyth gives paragraphs and sometimes pages of background information on these characters. The effect is like enduring the phony pleasantries of a salesman who is chatting you up before the pitch. Secondly, the success of the hero depends on the ""bad guys"" making a series of stupid mistakes, to the point that it becomes difficult to suspend disbelief. Thirdly, even as far as action adventures go, this one is lacking because the hero has almost no downturns or setbacks against which he must struggle. Even an episode of ""Scooby Doo"" has more plot twists. Finally, Forsyth frequently employs a prissy sort of writing style, using euphemisms and phrases in quotation marks when a direct statement would be more approriate. The overall effect is smarmy, outdated and predictable, like a Roger Moore-era James Bond flick."
2,Was this written by Frederick Forsyth?,"A villain who has disappeared from public view and now stays hidden in a fortress guarded by piranha filled canals, shark infested seas, man-eating dogs and machine-gun toting guards.Unfortunately this isn't a James Bond novel, it's actually written by Frederick Forsyth. How the author of ""Day of the Jackal"" and ""The Odessa File"" could perpetrate this piece of pulp is beyond me. Suffice to say Frederick Forsyth trying to write like Ian Fleming or Robert Ludlum is not worth it. Definitely to be avoided if you are a Frederick Forsyth fan and even more so if you haven't read any of his novels before."
1,Like an Airport Paperback by Unknown Author; Alternatives,"Your plane is about to board and you buy one of those paperbacksfrom the airport book store. Against your better judgment, becausethe author is an unknown and the font is too large, to make thebook thicker. But the cover suggests an intriguing, save-the-world premise, and sports a good picture of a submarine or a swastika, so you buy the book. Before you reach cruising altitude, you have given up on the book and are reading Skymall. Imagine that book. That is Avenger. Now you know what it will be like to try to read Avenger. Even worse, because you were expecting Mr. Forsythe. It is difficult to write this, because I am his best fan. If you have not read any of the following Forsythe books, buy these instead. You will savor the book, and honor Mr. Forsythe: Jackal, Deceiver, Odessa File,Devil's Alternative, Dogs of War, No Comebacks."
4,The End Justifies the Read,"Great ending! Most unexpected and satisfying. I also like that the main protagonist and hero is an old guy. 50+ ain't what it used to be! - Check out another aging hero in the political suspense thriller/military espionage novel,Evil, Be Gone"
2,Terribly disappointing,"A weak, half-hearted novel from a writer capable of much more. Character has never been Forsyth's strong suit, but in Avenger he has hardly bothered with it. Synopsis: An ex-tunnel rat from Vietnam is now a ""lawyer by day and a bounty-hunter by night"", motivated apparently by the death of his daughter and wife. He hires out to very well-heeled people who have been wronged and cannot get justice the usual way, to bring back whoever has wronged them and hand the low-life over to the authorities. This protag is completely unbelievable, as is the villain, a 100% evil Serb who has fled his homeland after the end of the war there, taking a billion dollars with him and setting up a Dr. No-style fortress off the coast of South America. Ian Fleming did it better than this. Forsyth's usual familiarity with technology and with the various intelligence and security organizations of the world is pretty weak here, if not absent. A pathetic example of resting on one's laurels."
3,Some good entertainment,"This is my third attempt at Forsyth after Fist and Jackyl. Jackyl is simply the best thriller I've ever read and Fist was too long and had too much exposition. This one is somewhere in between. The first part is incredibly tightly written, but part two goes overboard into exposition, reviewing history lessons about things I already know. It's paragraph after paragraph of basic modern history, with the only reward being the occasional quip at each paragraph's end. It's distracting and the time should have been used in other ways. Still, it is a fun read, but there will never be another Jackyl."
1,Avenger,"I bought and read almost all of FF's novels and enjoyed most. This publication is a bummer! My feeling is someone is re-writing history in a very distorted fashion for pure political reasons. Not so much Vietnam or Bosnia etc. but our own relations with OBL and his organization.It is historical knowledge that OBL is a true friend of the Bush family, that he was on the CIA payroll and still may be. The reasons that the arabic world hates us is not religious as this book makes you believe, but mainly found in a never-ending middle eastern conflict.To write a third grade book and semi-hiding just on the side some political statements, unproven and untrue, is scandalous. To see a review by someone under the signature of Gingrich only adds to the propagandistic ""value"" of this book.As much as I have tried, I can't find FF's original talent as a foremost writer of fiction anyplace in this ""novel"" I will save your readers time by rehashing the storyline, but it is amateurish and not believable"
2,Forsyth once wrote one of my favorite suspense thrillers,"The Odessa File. Judging from ""Avenger,"" those days are long gone. Forsyth needs to a) get an editor; b) begin to care about his readers again; c) rediscover a sense of pride in his craft.The narrative never attains any flow, which sharply reduces the level of suspense of this action-packed, yet dull novel. One problem is that Forsyth seems to think that every character must be introduced with a full-length birth-to-current biography. That's OK, if you're 15 years old and are just starting out writing, but points to the degeneration of Forsyth's skills.""Avenger"" is a wildly-implausible, sloppy piece of garbage."
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I have always been a big fan of Frederick Forsyth but this book is a disappointment! There are so many threads to the narrative that before he could weave them together into whole cloth I had to go back and re-read sections because I had forgotten ""who did what to whom"" (and no, I am NOT a slow reader). There was entirely too much pre-Sept.11 historical background that contributed little or nothing to the book and served as a distraction. Some was necessary but he should have saved all that for a non-fiction historical novel. By the time Mr. Forsyth got to the point, the book was almost finished."
1,Very disappointing,"Like the previous reviewer, I had my doubts that Forsyth actually wrote this. It reads like an amateur attempting to write in Forsyth's style. It's clumsy and convoluted, the characters are entirely two-dimensional, and what's more it's simply dull.I've loved every other Forsyth novel, but this is a real stinker."
2,WAY too much backstory!,"You want details? You want backstory? Then this is the book for you. I bet there are not 70 pages in this book that take place in the ""now"" of the story!EVERY time a new character is introduced the author has to give us pages and pages of backstory - school, war stories, etc. Toss in asides about the ""real story"" of Vietnam or the troubles in the Middle East (in the author's opinion). This all turns what is an OK story in a long and twisted read.As to some of the plot devices - the Avenger is smart enough to get his entry visa when they didn't think to look and engineered on purpose what happens at the end of the book. Sure a lot of it is a stretch - but I didn't have as much trouble with that part of the story as I did with all the needless, verbose, backstory.Wait for the paperback on this one - or get it from the library."
3,"A good book, but not great","I have been a big fan of Frederick Forsyth for many years. This book is closer to what I have come to expect from him. Having been so displeased with The Phantom of Manhattan, I was hesitant to pick up another one of his books. I was happy to find this book was very entertaining, suspenseful and fast paced.Contrary to Publishers Weekly, I do not think this is one of his best in decades (The Fist of God and Icon were both better). There isn't a lot in this book you cannot predict well before it is revealed. Regardless, it is an enjoyable book. The timeliness of the story and the integration of many people from current headlines blurred the lines between fact and fiction very well (I'm sure most people who read this book prior to March 2004 assumed terrorism expert Richard Clarke was a fictional character in the book).I recommend reading this book; but if you want classic Forsyth, I would suggest some of his earlier novels."
1,WORST TOOL EVER MADE PERIOD,"this tool is a waste of money. it takes too long, leaves a ridge on the inside that causes wire to stop dead in the middle of a long pull. its not worth the money just use a hacksaw. klein makes one similar to this and its probably a terrible tool as well. i am sorry i bought this."
5,Simply put - a great book!,"This book was a great help - read most of it one day, and used the techniques the very next weekend. A great book!"
5,Great Kidvid...,"....I should know, my bambino plays the heck outta Disney's Sing-Alongs. This is one of the best, but all are good. This has ""Honor to Us All"" and good guy Donnie Osmond voicing in ""(How Could I) Make a Man of you"" from Mulan, ""Zero to Hero"" from Hercules (with dynamite vocalists Tawatha Agee and Roz Ryan in a soul gospel quintet--ya gotta see it), the great Peggy Lee's ""Siamese Song"", Jason Alexander as a singing stone gargoyle from Hunchback, heck, even Eddie Murphey sings a line-- it has great splashes of excellent color, A-one animation, fabuloso sound and a Dolly Parton canine look alike on the highway to Nashville. It's great fun for kids and their parents."
1,Dont Waste Your Money,"An INCREDIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT. I was really looking forward to this game. It is TERRIBLE. It thinks its a fighting game, but there are no moves, the animation is not that great, and the game play stinks. The replay value is ZERO. Don't buy this game."
2,"This is a self-help book, promotes its seminars; no known secrets","As a disclosure, I did not read this book in its entirety nor in numerical order. I flipped through content in random. This book does not live up to its title. Makes numorous references to its seminars that they want you to go to. One of its declarations is that ""Rich people are bigger than their problems. Poor people are smaller than their problems."" -and my take on that is Rich people can afford to be bigger than their problems. Most things mentioned are common sense, no big secrets are disclosed. I don't want to discourage you from reading it, it may help you attain wealth but I wish I hadn't bought it. I think The Millionaire Next Door is a better read. My secret of the Thousanaire Mind - It takes money to make money. You heard it here first!"
2,nothing new,A lot of mlm hype - certainly not the realities discussed in more thoughtful books like Millionaire next door and Millionaire Mind.
5,You gotta want it....,"The book is spiritually smart and holds secrets to earthly levels of mastery. I love the book and I'm not rich yet, but the mind-set is pretty much astablished. It takes a lot of personal will to pull it through though....You cannot just read the book, you REALLY gotta want to change your inner world, and de-associate yourself from past fears. I suggest NET ( neuro emotional technique ) as a additional tool for releasing our negative patterns, and also to constantly monitor your thought forms in other levels too, not just financally. The book is amazing, and none have said these triths better than T. Harv Eker. I recommend HIGHLY this book."
1,RIP OFF Artists,"Great speaker and his book delievers quality information, all is spoiled by this act of DISHONESTY.Do not give your VISA information to Harv's crew b/c they will charge you for things you did NOT order or want.Intergrity and honesty in business is most valueable to me, is it to you?Why? Simply, if you scam people of their money they will NOT buy from you again and tell everyone else about it.Warmly,JP Richards"
4,Not just about money wealth,"I was given this book as a gift and was greatly touched by it. Harv opens up a whole new way of thinking for those who take the time to not only read the book, but understand the concepts and feelings behind it.However, it did take a while for me to get into the book - that's why I gave it 4 stars - it starts out a bit on the ""cult-like"" edge which almost turned me off to the whole message. Nonetheless, I kept going as I'd heard so many good things about it and I'm glad I did.Harv's style ultimately helped me discover the issues I've had with money to this point and has been pivotal in changing my thinking. Definitely worth reading."
4,Beware...Life Changing and Challenging!!,"This is a book that will force you to challenge your way of viewing your current financial situation. However, it offers time tested and proven replacements for all the ""old belief systems"" it is about to destroy.Not for the weak... if you are seriuos about taking responsibility for your life and picking up the challenge of self change... this book will provide an incredible pathway for you leading to improved abundance and confidence in your power to create your own life that way YOU want it.Even if you just get some of the concepts in the book... I beleive it will help you tremendously. Good Luck and many Financial Blessings to you!!"
1,Same old thing only with guilt.....,"I was deeply disturbed by this book and the guilt based ideas. It appears to be a very long commercial for upgrading to his next big seminar or class. It is just like being stuck in his seminar, you can hardly wait to get out. Very poorly written and too much fluff."
5,Great!,"I thought this was a very revealing book regarding the attitudes that we carry, and how they can be detrimental to our ability to create wealth. It makes you stop and think how you think about wealth, and people that are wealthy. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their attitudes about their aspirations of what they can attain, and just see how each of us could possibily be holding ourself back, just with our attitude. Very inspiritional!"
3,Need to attend his seminars,"Overall, a fairly good book with a lot of principles I've heard before. On the plus side: good, basic information on wealth consciousness and some exercises to help you reach your goals. On the negative side: you need to attend his introductory ""free"" seminar (which actually costs $96 for training materials, plus room & board for 3 days) to get your ""money Blueprint"" reprogrammed and be open to accumulating wealth."
4,"Great book, but a little bit of a push for his seminar","I liked that Harv talks about getting rich is somewhat of mind's game. If you can get your thinking right, then you will have bluerpint for riches. I don't think it is as easy as that, but the right thinking will definitely help.He does sell his seminar which in the very end he will give two free tickets if you bought the book and book before July 1 which is just a few days away. He has extended that offer, but instead of being free it is $79 which seems like a good deal. I have not been to the seminar (the closest one is 6 hours away), so I cannot comment on that.I would recommend giving this book a quick read. It does have some good pointers and at least it will give some good motivation."
3,Behind the formula - a good philosphy,"T. Harv Eker is blunt when making observations about your shorfallings, his solution to growth and wealth creation is confronting, and his underlying belief is that you can be what you want to be if you are prepared to look in the mirror and change the way you think. This is a good, thought provoking read on self improvement and wealth creation. It is a book you can return to and find useful hints on you, focus, wealth creation and personal growth."
5,T. Harv Eker.. a memorable name,"I enjoyed this book, read most of it, ... finally got to the end of the book... and had a moment of realization about the entire piece of literature. I actually don't think the book is about making money, even though on the surface it seems to be. Read it and see what you think, is it a surprise ending?"
5,Awesome book,Absolutely loved the ideas presented here. Really focuses on how millionaires think instead of pitching you on some business scheme or the newest online business fad. Highly recommended for anyone who has the desire to become wealthy.
5,Opens up a new way of understanding money,"I think that this book brings a new perspective to the way people think about money and why they think the way they do. It may not be all your fault as to why you see money the way you do, but it is your fault if you don't want to change, cause this book can show you how!"
5,"If You Know You Can't, You're Right","If you know you can't do something, you're right. As a first step to wealth, you have to be positioned to at least try.This book analyzes the basic fundamental thoughts that rich people have as opposed to the thoughts commonly found in poor people. Perhaps the most important is: Rich people believe 'I create my life.' Poor people believe 'Life happens to me.' With some seventeen such talking points, Mr. Eker attempts to establish a mindset that allows the reader to understand what he needs to do and think to develop wealthy thoughts, wealthy habits.Finally the purchase of this book allows the reader to attend one of Mr. Ekers seminars on a space available basis at no charge."
4,Secrets of the Millionaire Mind,"T.Harv Eker spends too much space upselling when the reader is expecting to be learning. If one is able to disregard this weakness, the remainder of the book is essential material. T. Harv Eker does a good job of teaching the reader how to think as a millionaire thinks, which is crucial to anyone aspiring to create significant wealth."
5,Secrets of The Millionaire Mind,"I found this book to be the most helpful in changing my ""Money Mindset"". Even more, I highly recommend taking the Millionaire Mind Intensive workshop which deals with the items in this book. The two go hand in hand to improving one's ability to create financial freedom. I am in total agreement with Mr. Eker's philosophy that as we change and recreate our inner world, it will not manifest in the outer world."
3,Millionaire Book,I think this books has some very helpful tips on how to view certain parts of your life to make it financially better. However it seems like the book is a big advertisement for his conferences. Buying the book only helps you think a little about how you view things in your life.
4,Get Rich Quick,"I""ve found with these writings that the authors are in it for the money so they usually don't give you the answers in the books they want you to come to their seminars to find the answers. So I didn't find what I was looking for in this book either and it will be the last Get Rich Quick I buy. And I will pick only one seminar to go to. Good luck to you all! May your dreams come true!"
4,Buy This Book!,This book definitely lives up to its title. You will get an insight into prosperity thinking. A MUST-READ.
5,Secrets of the Millionaire Mind,Excellent book if you have been reading other books on how to change your way of thinking. Seems to tie them all together with great strategies. I have already started sending this book to others that I associate.
5,Secrets of the Millionaire Mind,"A must read/listen, if it is important for you to take control of you financial future and identify things that may be holding you back. I've listened 3 times already, and each time, I get something new out of this book."
4,Very helpful!,"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of WealthT. Harv Eker has done it again! This book is conscise, an easy read and provides practical insight into how anyone can have a Millionaire Mind and master the inner game of wealth. I recommend it to anyone looking to unlock their inner power to create the kind of financial security they desire."
1,I think I was taken on this one,I wish I did not rush out and get this book because as many have said this is a book used as a upsell to the HIGH PRICED talks or workshops this man is hustling. I have not finished this book but so far there is alot of nothing being said accept to get more info take one of many courses offered. Oh and when you try to get the free stuff he offers in the book the web site does not work very well and I was not able to getthe free offer so I don't know if that is just more hype or maybe I will find somthing of substance that I have not yet found from reading this book. If it gets better I will come back and let you know but notice how many people are not pleased by the scam of this book. I truly hope it gets better and that I was not taken.
1,secrets of the millionaire mind,"I stumble on this book at the book store and and I spent 20 minutes skimming this book. I was disappointed. The book has nothing new to share. Don't get me wrong. I like books that can educate you and prepare you to how to be rich. However, I think most ""how to get rich books"" such as this one are overrated. They are pretty much same, saying the same thing over and over again such as focus on opportunities, stay positive, and stay out of debt. I don't understand why people in general can't seem to live within their means, educate them self about how to make money in the stock markets, real estates, or any ventures that will make them money. To me most people are just follower, eating up any mumbo jumbo ""how to get rich books"". Please don't buy this buy. Thank you."
2,Just old talk,"Just a lot of old talk and hype,normal thinking people should already have this study built into their system.May be people like guru tell them how to find the simpler things in life or may be it's a way to make easy money.OK this is America the wise shall live of the fools.I give this two stars just because I have the cd,and I can listen to know how others are thinking."
3,read my book but ATTEND MY SEMINAR!!!!!!,"Some good advice, but I felt Eker flogged excessively the promotion of his more expensive seminars. It's like the book is an appetizer but the $$$ seminars are the main course. Some of the advice is hokie in terms of, ""Put your hand over your heart, then pat your head."" What's next, the hokie pokey? Not a bad book, though, to reframe people's thinking about sound ways to accumulate wealth."
3,Many good ideas,I have enjoyed Harv Eker's Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth. I liked that there was an inward focus--since we often self sabotage and are not sure why. But I was not so impressed by the constant references to his many classes and retreats. I often found myself wondering if the book was written solely to get people hooked into taking one expensive class after another. I think the book's credibility would have been much stronger without Harv's constant sales pitches.
1,A Sales Pitch,Eker has written the book to promote his seminars. The book is useless as it is void of any strategies to be used by the reader. It is full of generalities and anecdotes that sound cheap and rudimentary.Hank
2,I don't know how to grade,"Pros: this book is actually quite inspiring. There are quite a few things said in the book that have made me think. For example, if you stay comfortable, that's where you will be, here.Cons:1. No joking, if on every other page, you find the author didn't mention his great seminar/tape/book, I'll give you a dollar. IT IS JUST TOO MUCH!!!2. It is true that action leads to result, but many of you must keep this in mind, 90% of business fail during the first year; 5% fail during the next 2; only probably 1% survive, if that.3. Getting rich involves a lot of hard work - even for Hally Barrie. If you are not willing to put down your time, energy, your health (very often), you CANNOT become rich by just taking actions.4. Save the get rich fast speech, please. Network marketing? Really? Are you kidding me?If the author could balance out the cons, which are easy to fix, I would rate this book at least 4 stars."
2,A Few Good Tips,"I bought this book and the audio version too. The CD is difficult to understand with the sound fading in and out, up and down. Maybe T. Harv is not the right man for the job. His is not a smooth voice. There is an obvious lack of compression on his voice that is a bit distracting. Perhaps, reading the book first, then listening to the tape if you want reiteration, would help to understand Eker's message. The book does an excellent job of selling his seminars too. The first one is, of course, free. After that it can get quite expensive. I took two and decided to also take Eker's advice and stop throwing good money after bad."
2,"Copy Of ""Rich Dad Poor Dad""","OKay... I have been reading this book and there are lots of things helpful.However one thing that bothered me is that he keeps advertising his seminars. In every chapter he relates the subjects he is defending , with what he teaches in his seminars...I personally dont like that..Book is written well and really takes the readers attention.Another thing is if you really want to understand the secrets of the millionares... READ ""RICH DAD POOR DAD""...by Robert KiyosakiHarv Eker's gives almost same points as Robert Kiyosaki's book ""Rich Dad....""So I recommend you to read ""RICH DAD POOR DAD"" before reading this. And when it comes to going to his seminars and paying thousands of dollars. Read other investment books of Robert Kiyosaki. I m sure that would be more helpful..!!!!"
4,Incredible,"""Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth"" by Harv Eker, is an incredible book that covers such topics as various success stories, the millionaire mind seminar, wealth file, rich people focus, and the money blueprint.The essence of this book is to focus on opportunities rather that obstacles. If you follow Eker's methods I'm sure you'll increase your wealth and quality of life.Also recommended are:The Passion Test: The Effortless Path to Discovering Your DestinyNexus: A Neo Novel"
5,Great value for the price of the book,"I've read Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Think and Grow Rich, The Millionaire Real Estate Investor. Which I believe are very good books and they get you pointed in the right direction and motivated. This book is very easy to read and very little fluff. It didn't have a lot of LONG drawn out stories to support his topic per chapter it was quite short. Obviously I liked it and I think most people will too. It was a bit irritating to read Millionaire Mind Intensive free seminar after every chapter but it doesn't take away from the books main points as some people have mentioned in their reviews.Motivational, inspiring, and a HOW-TO on changing your way of thinking."
5,This book really changed my way of thinking,"I don't normally write book reviews but I wanted to say that I loved this book. It was simple, I could connect with it and I thought it really hit where I was having issues with.I was so excited about this book that I bought one for a friend and shipped it to her. I also recommend it to other people I know."
5,"""One Of The Most Influencual Books I Have Ever Read""","T. Harv Eker demonstrates by using the power of our mindset we can acomplish our goals in simple context form. As a business owner & coaching mentour, I highly recommend this book to those wanting to become financialy free."
4,Good advises,"Very good advises, it complement the law of attraction , it easy and fun for read . Recommended for learning and change the mind for how the successful people thinks"
4,How much is your time worth?,"a good overall book i think it would be much better to attend one of his seminars... but if you dont have the time or the money... this is a great start. some ideas are rehash... but some are different, overall a good book, it doesn't just wet the appetite but gives some substance."
4,"Not how to make a million dollars, How to think so you can make a million dollars",Great book. Until you understand this. Don't worry about how you will make your fortune.
4,Wonderful CD,"I thoroughly enjoyed this valuable CD. It's content is wonderful and upbeat, and gives great information. The author is the narator, and is very interesting. Great for anyone to build their wealth skills."
5,I have a Milliionaire Mind!!!,"This book is phenomenal...I had just finished it and I am about to read it again to apply the activities and exercises given throughout the book. It is very easy reading, but at the same time very profound. I found this book to be inspiring to the point I look forward to a wonderful change in my life. I suggest this book to anyone who wants and desires to change their financial blueprint!"
4,Millionaire Mind,"Outstanding book and outstanding suport from T.Harv, I like the action steps(Awareness,understanding,Disassociation, Reconditioning. Once again thanks to T.Harv."
5,"Changed my Mind, Changed my Life","I bought this book because it was on a reading list from a yoga studio. The fact that a book about money was on a yoga reading list immediately intrigued me. Let me just say that this book totally changed my thoughts about money. It forced me to expose (to myself) the deeply ingrained ideas I had about money that I acquired from my family. For the first time in my life, I realized that what I thought about money just wasn't true. I learned that I could change my perception of money. This shift in my thinking was a pivotal event for me that led from my being a school teaching to owning my own business. I am so grateful for this book. Eker's seminars are outstanding as well. Just like his book, he forces you to look at your habits and thoughts. No hiding out in your comfort zone (so that's the link with yoga!)."
4,M's MMM review,"T. Harv Eker presents his way of thinking in a humorously straight forward yet simplistic way. The book is a quick-read, makes a lot of sense and tempts a person to check out the Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar. I'm waiting for the millions to roll in with my newly trained mind!"
4,Wonderful Book,"Easy to read, and understand. Loaded with useful information. Highly recommended, if you are thinking about buying this book move forward and do so."
4,Good tips,"There are many good insights in this book that are easy to understand. Implementing them requires discipline, though. Overall an easy read.Dr. Chrys Ghiraldini, NYC [...]"
3,Good,"It is not the best book i read, but its ok to listen while driving. Much better than listening to music, or radio because here you can learn something. Especially try to be better at your own characteristics."
2,4 stars when a new edition without seminar promotion comes out.,"The book was clearly written to promote seminars. It's got to be 20 times the seminar is promoted.Also the book has nothing to do with the ""The Millionaire Mind"" by Thomas J. Stanley.It's a fine book beyond that. Very motivating, and a quick read.I agree with the author about self-promotion, but this is over the limit."
4,Practical Advice plus Reach for the Stars,"Seldom do books combine down to earth practical advice with a 'reach for the stars"" mentality. Harv Eker manages to pull this off and keep you entertained at the same time. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and use many of the techniques on a regular basis. From saving money and learning to think about money in a new way, to rethinking your own mental make up and your self-worth, this book has many great points.I recommend it very highly. It literally turned my life and my thoughts around."
1,You will not get rich reading this book but the author will,"I borrowed this book from a friend and was very happy that I did not spend my money on it. I found this book to be a total waste of time. Many of the things he wrote about you can find online for free.I found the ""The Wealth Files: Seventeen Ways Rich People Think and Act Differently from Poor and Middle-Class People"" to be filled with assumptions. Some of the people who are Rich received an inheritance and never really did anything to benefit their money such as Paris Hilton.The only person that is getting rich is T. Harv Eker."
2,"Less substance, more hype","Yes, there are some thought-provoking ideas about why some people are not wealthy and others are. Yes, the rich think differently about wealth. (Hence the rating of two stars as opposed to one.)The book offers rather nebulous strategies in wealth growth, but without any concrete suggestions. Those nuggets are teasingly alluded to, but promised in Mr Eker's seminars. And from the examples in the book, during the first seminar, you will be hounded to attend the next..and the next...and the next, all the while contributing to Mr Eker's coffers.I walked away with the impression that the main purpose of this book is to pitch the seminars, and the author does so with the fervour of a used car salesman. I have already contributed to Mr Eker's net worth by buying this book. I would hate to insult my intelligence by contributing further by going to one of the seminars."
3,complaint and request for customer service,"two tickets to his seminar were supposed to be enclosed in thisorder.....inside the book, which were not enclosed.what do you know about this, or what can you do to correct thisplease advisegeri caswell"
1,Book never arrived - very disappointed!,"Never received the book, so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost I have incurred!"
1,Marv! read your own book you time waster,"What he has to say could be boiled down to about 5 pages.Don't complain, don't make excuses, don't justify, work hard, work smart, keep learning, buy real estate, start a business, think BIG, tell yourself its ok to be rich and ok to have money. Break out of any subconcious negative money conditioning you may have from your childhood. OK make that 1/4 page.You will not get your ""fianacial blueprint"" from this book, you will have to go to a seminar for that.His stories seem so contrieved you would think he made them up just for this book as filler. Marv say it aint so.This is a book for tiny minds."
3,"Decet book, but an even better sales pitch",Really the only reason I bought this book was to get the two free tickets to the MMI seminar.If you are expecting any specific tactics on how to get rich you should look elsewhere. The book conatins many good ideas and broad ways to improve your life but that's about it.Just like may other reviewers I felt the book was one big long sales pitch.But it was a a decent read and I picked up a few goof pointers.I don't know if i will actually go to the course.
5,Inspired reading,"This guy is the Werner Erhardt of the 21 century imho but in a much more modern way,yes he has taken stuff from other people he freely admits it, but his genius is in putting all together in a package. Truly inspiring and has already changed my life and my families at a core level like no other personal Developement program out there.I understand the bigger peoples claims are the more people are skeptical, but this guy is right on the money $$, and results will prove that , lets celebrate that this kind of thinking comes out ofAmerica :Land of the Brave and Home of the Free and that means financial freedom too!. and I am from England."
4,Sound and logical,A very practical read about how to change the dialogue of the voice inside your head. With this knowledge it then just becomes as mater of how much one really want that change in their lives. No one can do your push ups but you.
3,Millionarie Mind is Great but Not Touching Soul Purpose,"I believe the Secrets of The Millionaire Mind is a great Book for anyone who has some financial discontent, is open minded, and uses discretion in what they read.It pointed out to me where I maybe limiting my potential new worth with beliefs and habits that might not be working. The author has great suggestions for new habits that supposedly work for those who have achieved financial success and are reasonably content with it.I also recommend ""The Prosperity Paradigm"" by Steve D'Annunzio. Like this book, Steve's book can help you achieve greater net worth and also achieving a greater sense of self worth - both go hand in hand ."
2,A mystical pep talk with no solid information,"This book is very light in terms of content, it does not give you any definate strategy, just a lot of stories and anecdotes to pep you up. Of the 17 ""wealth principles"", many are worthless cliches, although several were sound and worthy of further reflection. The book is really spoiled by the author's reliance of several mystical beliefs, essentially bordering on the basic idea that if you think wishfully about money all the time, the universe will just provide more of it to you. The book is further devalued by the author's constant references to his additional products-I feel ripped out when I pay money for a book and instead of substantive information, I receive advertising. You can flip on the TV anytime late at night and watch advertising for various get rich quick schemes for free."
2,Overrated and nothing special.,"This book is nothing special. Your attitude and mindset is important as this book says, but there are much better books that inspire and offer practical and actionable advice. The hype wears off shortly after.This author has built an industry of his self-help products and motivates you to want to hear more, go to the next seminar, purchase his next course in the series of teaching courses that his company offers.Save your money and borrow the book from the library if you really want to read it."
2,Full of Clichés ..,"One of the reasons of not being rich is wasting time reading books about getting rich. This should be true also for myself who read this library book while I was looking for an entirely different book.If you succeed in writing a bogus book about being rich, you might get rich even if the book's content is not rich at all.Now touch your head and say:""I will never read a book about getting rich"".""Wealth Pinciple: Give me 5 minutes with this book, and I can predict I will never read a book on this subject again"""
1,Its an Infomercial...don't buy.,"He mentions his ""Millionaire Mind Seminar"" ALOT, trying to convince you how the seminar is great and worth it. Overall his message was good, but not different from Napoleon Hill books or other self help. $9.99 down the drain. I wish I could get my money back."
4,I am a money magnet,"As I read this book, I couldn'T help but think about how true everything he says is true. I couldn't believe how much thoughts affected my wealth. I grew up poor and I had such a ""poor persons"" attitude. I followed the advice that he provides, and it has completely changed my outlook. I have even started to attract more money into my life. I plan on attending his seminars."
3,"Warning! There are strings attached to the ""2 free tickets"" offer","The content of the book is useful, however there is a lack of disclosure regarding the strings attached to the free tickets to the Millionaire Mind Intensive weekend seminar.I just signed up for the weekend and found out that although the seminar itself is promoted here as ""free with the purchase of the book"", I'm required to buy a $97 package to attend. This is not my definition of free and I question the integrity of anyone who would think that it is.I've heard good things about the seminar and understand that circumstances can change. That's life. However, I'm told that the new policy was introduced 3 months ago Sept 2006, and yet the peak potentials web site and this one still have a graphic declaring that you get 2 free tickets to the seminar.If it said, ""two free tickets with the purchase of our $97 package"" I would not have written this review."
5,A MUST read book,"I have to say that I came across this book by mere chance & I'm so glad that I made the decision to buy it. For me I had alot of aha moments that I was shocked at how I was damaging my financial situation myself. the book does not only give you the know-how but it gives solutions & a brief saving plan that works so well. It delivers alot & I remember reading it like a curious child, that I finished the whole book in only 3 days & never got bored!! I'm even planning on reading it again.I say go ahead & buy it coz its worth every penny & ur gonna love it :) Harv has a very unique way of writing that is so humble yet straight to the point..Its one of the best books I ever read."
3,Not bad,There are some valuable lessons in this book to take away. This one is definitely worth adding to your library.
2,Great Book to STUDY,"Good reading, valuable information for practical application - I use it every day, first in the am and then in the pm just before I go to bed. I have a millionaire mind!"
2,Just OK.,It is just a book which encourage you to dream big. No real stuff! I felt it was not helpful. 2 stars only.
2,Fluff,"In preparation for a long flight I was caught in a bind with nothing to read and was at an airport that carried very few English books. I went on a limb and picked this up due to the lack of options.It was an easy read but at the end of reading it, I wondered if my time would have been better spent staring aimlessly at the seat in front of me.This book lacked substance and came across as a giant sales pitch for the author's seminars. Do not waste your time on this one."
3,"Good, but too many pitches.","Overall, I really like the book. The author does help you think about things in a different light. However, I couldn't get over all the pitches for his seminars. Really, the seminar pitches would take me out of the book, and put me into ""commercial mode."" You know, when you think to yourself, ""When does this commercial end so we can get back to the content?"" I wouldnt let that stop you from buying the book, but just so you know, you'll get a pitch for the seminar every couple of pages."
3,Not a lot of meat,"This book is a motivational book not a how to book. If you know that going into it you can better appreciate it. If you are struggling mentally with being weathly or if you are just starting on your journey this book could be very vlauable. For me, I have read many books on the topic of weath creation and found this one more of a pep rally than a nuts and bolts type book. This book left me disappointed hence the 3 star rating."
3,almost excellent if it weren't for the non stop seminar promoting,"This is a very motivating book with a refreshing take on ""rich"" thinking and what has gotten in the way of many people who ""want"" to be wealthy, but still are poor.Yes, a lot of it is recycled, but I do like hearing it in a new perspective.It was hard to enjoy the book and not feel like I was in a car dealership with the non stop references to his Millionaire Mindset Seminars, he was always either giving an example of how it helped someone or was suggesting that the seminar can help you further.I didn't buy this book to get a ""taste"" of what he has to offer, I was hoping that he would be generous in sharing the ""Secrets of the Millionaire Mind"". Is it too much to ask for a book to be completely genuine, helpful with NO agenda for backsales or seminar selling??Great guy but...... too turned off by his relentless promoting."
4,"Harv has a Point By Bradford P. Miller, Author ""Lessons From Rocky""","Three years ago my wife and I read this book and although Harv has been accused of ripping off other writers, which may be true, Harv, in the process of writing his book has stumbled over some other less know truths about money and people's relationship with money.Are there truly any new ideas. If you look at this book from the perspective of maybe where Harv literally came from, ( his childhood) you may see his discovery of money and his relationship with it.I have been to six of his seminars and would say that the experience was 90% beneficial. There were times that it was just overboard, but we all need support in life and the lessons learned could help anyone.My recommendation is to invest the money and read the book. If you don't like it, give it to someone who you think might benefit from it. If you like it then keep it for future reference.Bradford P. Miller, Author, ""Lessons From Rocky""Lessons From Rocky"
2,One long sales pitch for his seminars,"Near the end of the book, T. Harv made a great point about ""if you learned something, it was worth it."" - I don't think he was referencing the book, but i did learn a few things...and with this logic, it was worth the quick read. What I couldn't stand were the non-stop references to his seminars and subtle hints about how pyramid schemes can make folks money. I'm guessing there is some sort of referral/pyramid scheme with his seminars, hence the majority of the book came off like one big sales pitch to attend his seminar. Take out all references to his seminars and how much they'll help your or have helped others, and you are left with 1/2 of the content, which again, would be worth the read and has some good ideas/points."
4,Not just a book...It's a great study,"I have only read 3/4 of this book and it is clear to me that I will read it again, with my highlighter in hand. It is so clear and he discusses his program in readable language."
4,Secrets of the Millionaire Mind,It is a very good book that I found enjoyable and thought provoking. I plan on following some of the suggestions in the book.
5,LOVE IT!!,"I think Harv hit the nail on the head with this one. I love the reinforcing of the mantras and the actions he gives you to take. It is a great book for anyone who wants to change the way they think about their situation, financial or otherwise. This is a must for all!!"
3,"Nothing new, but convenient","Nothing mentioned in this book is new, but it is a convenient collection of the programming one needs to develop an attitude toward attracting and keeping wealth. The author's style comes across as smug, and frankly, he isn't rich enough (depite what he thinks) to be qualified. But then the really rich wouldn't be writing a book. Please read as subjective guideline and don't be a zombie follower like some of the reader reviews you see here."
1,Don't waste your time,"I've read two of T. Harv Eker's books and he has failed as an author in both attempts. I wasn't going to write a reveiw for this book until I unintentionally realized as I was comparing two terrible books that just finished within a month of each other were written by him. Money is inheritently connected to psychological behavior, however it isn't a deep seeded root of your subconscious whether or not you 'have what it takes to be a millionarie' as this book implies. Both of his books seem liked rushed attempts at self-help or personnel development and both missed the mark and made zero postive impact on my life. I'm just happy that Amazon let me buy the used version so atleast I didn't waste as much money as I could have. Stay away from this author and read The millionarie next door, and the Rich Dad Poor Dad series, and you'll find yourself getting the information that T. Harv Eker tries to present but fails."
2,Mostly Useless,"I was unimpressed with this book. The basic premise here is auto-suggestion, covered much better by other authors.Think and Grow Rich!: The Original Version, Restored and Revisedfrom Napoleon Hill andThe Magic of Thinking Bigby David Schwartz are both much, much better books all-around and cover the idea of auto-suggestion. Put the money you would have spent on this book into one of those two books."
5,Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth,This book can change your life if you are looking to help improve your financial position for the rest of your life and for your family.
2,Selling The Seminar,"This was not one of my favorite books in this genre by any measure. It seemed as though the Author was intent on convincing the reader that he/she must attend his seminar, and while I'm sure that would be a good experience, it is definately not what I was looking for when I purchased this book. I know of several books of this genre that are far better than this one. This books promises more than it delivers."
4,Solidly above average.,"Not a GREAT Star Trek story, but a solidly above average one; decent plot, good characterization, good pacing, competently written. Moderately amusing plot twist to solve the main issue. Nothing spectacular, but well above the mid-point for the genre."
3,Into the Boredom of Uninterestingness,"An uninteresting, totaly predictaple plot, the same kind of ending (if not worse...), no character development... This wasn't one of the best books, but it held fairly well with good writing, an interesting idea (although poorly handled), and 'screentime' for many characters, including the greatly ignored cat, Spot. It's worth one read, I think, but nothing you'll remember later."
5,Cats,"If you like cats you'll love this Star Trek novel. You have to wonder who exactly saves the *Enterprise* was it the people or Data's cat Spot. If you like star trek then this book should be on your must have list. If you don't like star trek well think about it if you like animals then you'll like this book because an animal will save the ship. Well, I would recomend this book to anyone."
2,It's like a series of articles profiling similar companies,"I've just finished this book and as I read the other reviews, I'm not surprised that the reviews most people found helpful were the negative ones. This isn't a bad book if you are solely looking for an interesting read as most of the ten companies the author profiles are widely known and it is fun to learn about them. But each company's story gets more and more predictable and the 'radical' marketing schemes don't seem so radical anymore. If you've read any of the books by Ries and Trout on Marketing, you really appreciate how succinct they are in delivering their many lessons. I can't imagine this book as serving any real practical use to Marketing professionals, but if some of the companies featured in this book interest you, it makes for some interesting, albeit light, reading."
2,Boring.,"For a book that is supposed to be about radical marketing, I am not sure why this one had such a conservative world view -- or why the ""experts"" quoted were from the traditionally strong marketing establishment like P&G.; What do I really care what a P&G; brand manager/VP has to say about how Harley markets?Much too tame, staid, and academic to be of much interest. I won't finish it."
3,Shorter will be better,"Actually, it is quite interesting and attractive that author use ten successful companies as an example to promote radical marketing. And we can learn that to run a business successfully, it is not only spend a lot of money on advertising, but also keep a good relationship with the customers and provide a good quality product. As most of the company just promote its products and company on advertising, I think it is a good way for others company to follow.However, although there are ten case studies, after reading half, I¡m not really want to continue as all of the cases are similar. These ten companies stay at a similar situation, just face a difficulty and then using similar tactics that is radical marketing to tackle the problem. Therefore, it will be better if the author come up the points in fewer cases."
2,Jose Mardones' acoustic recordings give us a limited view of his art,"Unfortunately, all of the selections on this CD are from the acoustical periodof human recording. Mardones has a huge voice, but little of interest showsthrough on this disc. He died in 1932, and made an unintestering zarzula recordingduring the electric period, but the use of the bass voice there, is of little interest musically.IF Mardones recorded arias and songs during the electric period, then these might be of muchgreater interest to listen too. Conrad Claborne"
3,To th point,"This small book really covers all the points in ""passengers"" language.After reading it the passenger is able to appreciate the complexities of putting some 250 tons ii the air , having it hurtle at more than 600mph and more important , stay up and land in one piece."
5,A Basic Primer for Nature Writers and Naturalist/ Ecologists,I am thrilled that this book has been reprinted and recommend it to all who want to write about nature or who would become Ecologists or Naturalists. Watts writes with so much descriptive clarity that the scene and the natural occurances seem to come immediately to life on these pages. I have been to some of the areas she writes about and have a far more succinct appreciation for these landscapes. Should be recommended reading for every student of nature.
3,not as expected,"well i bought this case and now i regret that i bought it,it's of low quality and i think it can't protect the camera ..i think a universal hard case will be more durable"
4,Protect your Investment,"Olympus Neoprene Soft Digital Camera CaseLightly padded, this case comes with a small pocket ideal for carrying a spare battery or memory card. Wrist handle is good as is belt loop, but would prefer a longer strap for over shoulder or around neck. Good value overall."
5,Neoprene Camera Case,Excellent product and Price. Holds and protects the camera well - plus extra pockets for easy money or credit card storage!
3,Good case,I bought this case for an underwater camera. It barely fit in so I ended up not using it. I used it for holding memory cards and batteries and it worked out great. The camera I bought with it was an Olympus TG-610 Tough 14mp.
2,Too Small for Camera,"I was disappointed in this case, the camera doesn't really fit. I did use it to carry the charger and extra battery on vacation."
3,ok,"Olympus Neoprene Soft Digital Camera Case, but not served to Olympus SZ-31MR 16MP CMOS Camera with 24x Wide-Angle Zoom and 3-inch 920k. The bag is good but don't for the Olympus SZ-31MR."
3,Missing the logo,"I like the camera case because it holds my olympus camera perfectly. However, I recieved my case without the olympus logo which is why I ordered this particular one in the first place. I own other cameras, and I liked the case as pictured because that is how I am able tell my cameras apart when I throw them in the drawer. Oh well, it still holds my camera and protects it from scratching."
4,good,"good overall. a bit difficult to put the camera in and pull it out, esp. if u have the plastic protecting skin on the camera. also, it would be nicer to have other optional ways to wear this instead of just having it in ur bag or on ur wrist all the time"
5,Good camera case,"If you are looking for a small, light weight case for your Olympus 1030SW this one fits the bill."
3,Nothing special...,"I bought this Olympus camera case in Nov'08 from Amazon to go along with my new Olympus Stylus 850SW camera.I think the case is mediocre. It could fit the camera snugger and the material is a bit thick so it is bulkier in my pocket than I want it to be. The wrist strap that it comes with is also way too long adding to the bulkiness.If I had a time machine, I would not buy this camera case again. Rather than buying a case sight unseen, I would have just tried out cases in a physical store until I had best fit for my camera. I've had better camera cases in the past.I hope you found my review helpful."
2,"""Good Enough"" but DID NOT HAVE OLYMPUS ON CASE...a bit disappointed.","Item was inexpensive and you get what you pay for. It is a fine case for $4.95 but it DID NOT HAVE OLYMPUS ON THE CASE as shown in the ad. I was disappointed because this was for Mother's day to go with a new Olympus camera for our mother. The family members who ""chipped in for the gift"" thought it was just a ""cheapo"" from Walmart."
3,"Nice, quality case... not much room for storage.","This case fits the Olympus Tough camera ""like a glove"" but does not allow for much storage of extra batteries or cords. Probably would be best as an ""on-the-go"" case for when on a trip or assignment. Most likely needs a larger carrying case with more storage for everyday use."
1,For UZ 590 - no way!!,"Though the little case is fine for what it is, Amazon touts it as a popular purchase for Olympus UZ 590 buyers. That's a real laugh, and misleading, as the camera case doesn't begin to fit that camera. It is a tiny case!"
2,oooops,"the item in question was to be for my new camera but obviously someone goofed, this item did not come anywhere near to fitting the camera it was ordered to go with. I did not sent it back because it fit a much smaller digital that I have. I now have no case to protect my new Olympus SP-590UZ.Gary"
5,SMALL BUT DON'T BE FOOL,"IT is SMALL but don't let it fool you , I can actually fit camera, 2 batterys, 2 PictureCard Flash Memory Card with the case,on back of case it has a velcro wrap strap that allows you to wrap your charger cord and also carry it with you.Its is so great that this small case can carry so much .It is nice looking and soft while also protecting your items and it also fits anywhere even in your coat pocket. Many has comment at me and has ask me where can they purchase such a small and great case.Will recommend to all that have asked and to those that don't know yet about this small case and how much it can carry .Great case ,thank you Amazon."
4,Nice Olympus Camera case for the money,"Not a bad camera case for the price ($13.44 shipped from Cameta Camera). It fits our Olympus Stylus 740 nicely. It's not bulky, but seems like it would provide decent protection in case of an accidental drop. The small pouch in front is nice. The only negative comment I have is that maybe a neck or shoulder strap would be nice to have (it comes with a wrist strap only). It's not fancy, but gets the job done at a fair price."
5,"Nice quality, perfect fit for Olympus waterprrof camera",Very pleased with quality and ease of use. The Olympus waterproof camera (mine is a 2009 model) fits perfectly in this case and the price was less than the generic camera cases sold at Target/Walmart.
5,Fits Stylus 850 camera perfectly,"Its soft, snug, and fits my camera perfectly. Has a velcro closure. I'm use to zippers and am undecided on that feature. I would buy it again, which is to me, the ultimate seal of approval."
3,not a good fit for olympus tough,"this case is barely big enough to fit the olympus tough, which it is marketed to go with. the pocket in front is presumably to hold an extra battery, bu the battery falls out easily."
3,Wrong picture-misleading,"I had to return this probuct because unlike the picture that was shown, the item shipped did not have ""Olympus"" on it. Being that it was made of cloth, that would have added to the overall outlook of the product and given a better impression of the actual camera inside (that's just my opinion). For the price though, maybe it's not bad. I think I'll go for a leather case which I'm already used to."
3,Not that much protection...,"The case fits snugly with my u-Tough 8000 camera but does not provide the amount of protective cushioning that I would have liked. I guess the u-Tough was designed to withstand heavy wear and tear but I'd say at best, this case helps to protect the screen and camera body from scratches. I wouldn't have much confidence in the case from protecting the camera from drops."
4,good,"I bought this for my new digital camera (olympus tough 6020), particularly to ensure that the camera didn't break and that there was somewhere to store any extra cards. fits perfect. It's simple and functional. for the price.. can't get any better... go for it.."
1,starting to fall apart after 3 months,"Ordered this item in November for a christmas gift. The camera works great, but this cover is falling apart. The sewing is pulling away from the neoprene."
3,Where's the extra pocket?,"Where's the extra pocket for the extra battery, memory card and charger? I want something with a zipper to hold the extra items. Not just a open pocket."
2,"Ok, i guess","I guess it covers the camera, but the padding doesnt feel like it would protect the camera at all if it fell on a corner, also the spare battery keeps falling out of the badly designed front pouch thing every time i open it. I wouldnt buy this again as i have no confidence in it."
3,Not the right size for Olympus Tough TG 820,"Bought this case for my Olympus Tough TG 820 because it was recommended to go with the camera... Kind if a faulty recommendation though because it's just a tad bit too small. Nice camera case otherwise, would work for a little smaller camera..."
2,Too small for Olympus 228825 (SZ-30MR),The rating is for Amazon's recommendation. It's too small for the Olympus 228825 (SZ-30MR). It would fit a Canon PowerShot with some room left over.The pocket for the additional media card seems a bit insecure. A user should keep the flap closed (magnetic latch) to avoid losing the media card or spare battery.
2,CAMERA CASE'S SNAP CLOSURE DOESN'T WORK,"THE CASE ITSELF IS VERY NICE WITH A LITTLE POCKET TO STORE PICTURE CARDS OR EXTRA BATTERY BUT THE SNAP CLOSURE DOESN'T STAY CLOSED. I WOULD WORRY THAT CAMERA, CARDS OR BATTERIES WOULD FALL OUT!"
1,Disappointed,Was very disappointed with this item. The opening has an elastic closure and you have to use two hands just to get the camera in or out.Not worth the cost to send it back.
5,Olympus Neoprene Soft Digital Camera Case,Great case overall for protecting my camera. Not a high end case but does the job and at a great price. Would recommend.
4,good value,Camera case has two pockets and strap and a belt loop. It is made well. Value for price is good. Would reccomend
4,Enjoyed,I received this item very quickly and have enjoyed it. It was a gift for my father and we will be watching this together for years to come!
5,A Must See,This movie is extremely informative. entertaining and just down right good. Harry Belafonte steals the movie with his incredible funny antics and excellent acting.I was unaware of the plight of African Americans during this period of our History and this movie does a fantastic job of filtering out all characters in the film. Great entertainment.
4,Pretty Good Western From A Different Angle,"This is a western coming from a very different perspective. It is good, but still a little slow at times. Other than that small complaint, I would say the movie was very, very good. If you can rent this movie, do so. It will be weel worth your time."
3,Buck/Preacher review,"Dvd was entertaining; however, there are other more worthy moviesto watch for less or for same price."
5,Brought The Black West to Life Before Posse,"While I liked Posse, This was the film that brought the Black West to a wider audience. Sidney Poitier as Buck is exciting and Harry Belafonte and Cicely Tyson give him a big helping hand."
5,The Best So Far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"James Bond Agent: Under Fire is one of the best games ever. The graphics are awesome and gameplay is way to fun. You get the collest weapons, gadgets and cars including the cool BMW. If you get this game you would wish you bought it earlier."
1,007 Agent under fire,"First of all, the Gamecube version was the best thing EVER!!! Then, I got the PS2 version. to put it in simple man terms.... I would rather puke!!!"
5,MY FAVORITE GAME!!,"As a fan of Goldeneye for n64, it was obvious this would be great, but i had no idea! The driving levels alone make it worth it, but there is so much more! Buy this game!!"
2,Another 007 messup..........,Graphics: 5 The graphics are in my opinion better tHAN perfect darks graphics. This game has wicked pictures and animations but is that only what counts?Gameplay:3 Gameplay is okay but when I play it on My Ps2 I keep wishing that I could hook my gc controller into it.Sound : 2 Sounds could get a bit better with some explosions and gunshots.Replay Value: The game is too short. I beat the game in less than 1 1/2 days. The levels are all very straightforward and there are hardly ever any challenges. ...
1,"Don't buy this game, never ever!","This game really (@#)!!! I never liked FPS on video games consoles but this game is stupid! In this kind of games, using the controller is difficult. I am not saying that all the FPS (*&@!), like Medal of Honor it was a FPS for PSX and I really like it, it was hard but worth to buy.But 007 agent under fire, I think is the worst game in FPS I have ever seen. First of all, is a very easy game, they will tell you what to do all the time, it means that you don't really have to think in this game. Other thing that I hate about this game is there is always that stupid sound(bond theme) every time you kill someone or do something.I can believe that some people say that it is the best PS2 game!! There are others that even compare this game to Metal Gear 2.If you are a real gamer you will just waste your money in this (@#*!)!"
1,You should buy this if you like really (...) games.,"Yet another horrible rip off of the goldeneye. The missions are boring and obnoxious. The multiplayer is quite poor. The graphics are not even very good. After playing this game for an hour, I will never play it again. Nobody should waste (dollar amount) on this drek."
4,fun,"this game will be 10 times as better as goldeneye, recommended for all goldeneye and first person shooter fans."
3,Not bad for a shootin Game!!!,"007 is a good game, lots of action from run from a man with a gun to drive a car loaded with weapons and missiles. But it just doesnt add up to the power of SOCOM U.S. Navy Seals, but i call it second best shootin game."
3,ok game- not worth your money,i had fun with this game for the first month or so but after a while it gets boring. the graphics are pretty good but there is no replay value. dont buy this game- wait for nightfire.
3,Average Shoot em up,"I was hoping this game would be just like 007 Golden Eye. As I started it up, and the very first mission, I got through it without even taking half my life. It would have been nice if the images would have been alittle sharper, but I think they took to much of an advantage on the PS2 graphics, which hendered the overall gameplay. Also, the shooting is a bit different. I remember in one mission, I unloaded 30 shots into a guys chest, and he still stood there shooting back at me. Even with the Shotgun, which is one of the best close-up and new weapons of the game, it took another 3 shots. It shouldn't be that hard to kill someone, I'de hate to see how much it takes in 007 mode. Also, there's a big lack of missions. They end and leave you hanging with nothing. It was like, What was the point of getting the vials if I lose them 3 seconds later. I'de have to rate this 3 out of 5 stars.Replay - 4Looks - 3Style - 3music - 2"
4,Pretty good... I had a blast playing it!,"Last time I played this was when it first came out.. I think January 2002.. This game is pretty good. I don't have a PS2, (I want one BADLY) but I'd surely rent this again if I had one. Last time I played it was when I visited a really good friend down in Georgia. He also has Tekken Tag Tournament which is also a very good game :) This game has wonderful graphics, though I do admit it was pretty easy once you got through a couple of tough spots, but it doesn't really matter unless you are really having fun ^__^ The only other peeve about this game is the repetitiveness. (Wow, I really spelled that wrong) I constantly crashed and died on the city car chase level, and was up till about 2 in the morning until my friend and I finally finished it. Overall, this is a very good game. Certainly worth renting!"
4,Ea can do better with 007,"this game was pretty cool but Goldeneye was better. the thing this game lacks is blood. the next bond game should be Goldeneye, but it should have better graphics. the thing i like about this game is the fact that the game is detailed and the weapons. the next game could be better."
4,James Bond: Agent Under Fire,"If you haven't noticed lately, EA Games has been getting lackluster on its games: Freekstyle was a cheap reinvention of previous hit SSX, NBA Street Volume 2 was a replica of its first one, just with updated lineups, and NFL Street was unable to live up to its hype.'Agent Under Fire' is an improvement for EA, but it isn't no perfect game. The first few missions are extremely easy and the enemies fall to the ground within 2-6 shots. The game gradually gets more challenging, but gameplay seems choppy. The weapons are their usual while the gadgets are sort of neat. The enemy AI is poor, but the graphics are great for a James Bond game. Bottom Line: of course, you'll have fun playing this game (It's James Bond game...duh!), but it's not as good as Nightfire and seems to only meet standards, not exceed them."
4,great for a month or party,This is a great game. the only problem is that after you beat it the only fun left is the two player mode.
5,Provides hours of entertainment.,"If you ever get really really bored, or just need someting for your kids to do this is great. You won't get tired of it easily."
4,it's ok,I rented the game and the missions were3/5 stars. The multiplayer wasn't that great though. If the multiplayer had bots I probably like the game more. I really look forward to nightfire. So far I think the best james bond game is goldeneye by raware for N64.
2,Haven't played a video game in 5 years,"This game was way to easy. When I beat it I thought, ""That's its."" I would not recommend this game to other people unless you are buying it for the multiplayer mode."
2,A big let down,"This game is like all the other Bond games, Except Golden Eye. It took me three hours to beat the entire game. The multiplayer is slow and akward. The control set up is difficult to learn and thier are few options to get out of them. If you like Bond rent this one, if not save your money and with your extra time go find yourself a girlfriend. You'll be glad you did."
4,the runner up bond game. (Goldeneye being the best),like everyone else this game is good but lacks blood and jaws and oddjob. wat is good though is their new gadgets like the q -claw i love killin people by spearin them wit it. Their guns are better too. and oh r the bond gurlz stunnin. it is a must have for any bond lover
4,Great Game for any 007 Fan,"This game is a must have for Bond fans. It's full of action and the graphics are out of this world. But, there's one thing I don't understand. In level 4 Bond's in this building guarded by a handful of soldiers. Too stop these soldiers he has to use a tranquilizer. It's easy to get them all at first. But, there's one soldier that's on the floor where Bond can't get to. The soldier moves so quickly that it's virtually impossible to shoot him. This sounds strange, but can someone show me how you can get this guy in only one shot. Other than that, I enjoyed this game. It was well worth the money."
4,Great Game but to easy,"This is a great game but it is to easy, i finished it in 4 hours and im not even a good gamer plus i rented it. So if your looking for a good action and adventure game for PS2 its really fun but you should problaby rent it first because its so easy."
4,good game,this game is fun. the levels aren't way too easy like everyone says. the difficulty is perfect so you dont get [mad]... when you cant beat a level. this game is great
2,Bondgression,"I just reviewed Night Fire (far superior) and realized I missed this one. I wish I had missed it at the store too. This is definetly a rental.The game just doesn't feel right from start to finish. My biggest complaint is weapons fire. It doesn't feel like really firing a weapon. It's more like your shooting noise maker that spits out little tracers.This game had so much potential, it's to bad.However, Bonds face is better in this one than in Night Fire (Bronson on Botax). EA should stick to the Generic Bond face like in this one. The role is about to change anyway (Jude Law anyone)."
2,Not Very Good At All...,"The conquest for any big-screen to PS2-screen game is just simply to be good. The plots always become to developed without you actually doing anything to invoke it, just shooting some people, and sitting through a cut scene. This game is no exception. There seems to be no storyline continuing into the actual gameplay, just the cut scenes. The levels don't allow any exploring. Further more, even though I enjoy an easy, fairly quick game, AUF takes both of those to extremes. If you're good, these measly 11 levels can be beaten in 2 hours.There are two good parts though. The controls are good, allowing you to scroll through Q's gadgets easily. The second is the multiplayer mode, with about ten unique environments, and cool weapons.Overall: Buy only for the multiplayer mode."
3,Goldeneye still reigns supreme,"What IS it about these last FOUR 007 games (Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, 007 Racing and now Agent Under Fire)??? They all fail to live up to the gameplay/storyline of the magnificent Goldeneye. For those of you reading the advance 'reviews' proclaiming this to rival Goldeneye should listen to those of us that just wasted 50 dollars to purchase: The Game Is Not Enough - to rip off a recent Bond title. Save your money and rent this - you'll finish it in the 5 day rental period and thank me for it. The game is far too short. Q, M and even James himself blurt in to explain the obvious at every turn and there is no way to turn that feature off. Takes all the fun out of exploring and insults the gamer. I'm going to have to dig out my N64 and plug Goldeneye back in to get my fix now...."
4,Worth the $$ for a solid one player game,"When I heard they were going to make another FPS(first person shooter) in the bond series I was thrilled. Now in retrospect, I can say that I was no goldeneye, but the One-player game was much better. Multiplayer was not a good thing and the levels are way to small but if you like one-player FPS's this is a great title to have."
3,"A Good Game, But...","AUF was a good game if you wanted to kill a few brain cells and 10 hours. I am not high octane ""gamer"" and still found the game kind of flat.Granted, it was fun to play, but it left me feeling empty when the world was saved. Alas, real-life is not the Bond-life."
2,nothing close to golden eye on n64,"I was hopeing that the new james bond game agent under fire would be like the good old days of james bond games(like golden eye)but it is not.Pros:pretty good graphicsCons:battle mode,control,sound,replay,ai (bad)=2 starsso if you are a big fan of 007 you maybe should pick up this game but you should by meatl gear solid 2 of tony hawk pro skater 3"
1,A suckable senseless shootem up,My brother beat this game for a friend it is horrible. The enemies are dumb the gameplay is easy and unchallenging. My brother got up to the halfway point of the game in like 1 and a half hour. The story does not deserve the title of bond. I thought this might be a good game. The shooting enemeis is like shooting poorly made slow robots with pittiful IQ.Pros: Great graphicsA wide supply of gadgetsCons: Pittiful Enemy AICar missions are reppetetiveVery shortVery EasyHorrible storyBoring GameplayIsn't faithful to bond's styleCombat is Basicly shooting slow and dumb enemiesBad gun designAverage Multi Player
4,Exciting And Violent,"Just like every first-person shooter game, it`s violent. There is no blood which is why I like it. But they have bad langauge which is okay. The graphics are realistic,but I would give it a 3 in graphics. The guns and bombs might be too violent for children under 6. The game is very spy-like as any 007 game and has tons of violence.Almost every minute you are shooting down someone or someting. The langauge is very bad so thats what gives it a 4."
2,00 ZERO,"This game [stinks]!!!!!!! The graphics are pretty cool. So is the multyplayer but the missions are easy to beat. Though they are easy you will ABSOLUTELY NEVER MAKE A GOLD MEDAL unless it's the first level or two. Also if you don't get gold medals then you don't get bonusses, making it impossible to get the full arsenal on multyplayer. This game is not realistic, I've shot a box with a rocket after laying 6 mines on it...it didn't even budge. The weapons aren't satisfactory at all, and probably the best feature,multyplayer, gets really really really boring after a very short while. Overall DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I REAPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!! It's not worth it. If you want a good shooter game get Max Payne, or Red Faction!"
3,Not GoldenEye but not bad.,"EA has yet to prove they can really do something with the powerful Bond license. They have yet to produce a product as good as Rare's GoldenEye. This is probably their best attempt yet. The driving levels are actually better than GoldenEye's and the ""Bond moves"" concept is interesting. But the level design is lackluster, there are only 12 levels, and the control on the FPS levels is a little loose. (And where is the nice GoldenEye control for peeking around corners to shoot?) It is defintely a fun game, but there are better FPS games out there for the PS2 such as Half-Life, Red Faction, and, of course, Metal Gear Solid 2. Since this game was delayed a year, I was certainly expecting a lot more. Please do better next time, EA, Bond deserves it!"
3,In general the next golden eye....,"This game LOOKS like it is cool and is the next goldeneye/[halo](for you better gamers) but then you play it and well i got tired of all the worthless gadgets like ""heres a lockpick for the master of lockpicking"" there were so many gadgets it took a while to scroll through them to get through the weapons.(pp7 90% of the time). This is cool with good grapics but EA tried too hard. Worth a look for fps fans but none other."
2,Horrible,"This game is so dumbed down that it isn't even fun. It would at least be somewhat fun if Q wasn't walking you through the whole game like you were a freaking moron. ""Hey I think I see a lock on that door that you can burn through with your laser!"" I think that they misjudged the audience, I mean come on, this game's rated Teen, and Teenagers aren't that stupid."
2,Mayday! The rating is going down!,"James Bond: Agent Under Fire, is fun at first, but then it just really starts to tick you off. Then you wish that you would have bought James Bond: Nightfire. (which is worth five stars on my count)The graphics and everything is much better on nightfire than on agent under fire. Don't buy this game. Don't listen to the bad votes for nightfire. those are just lies. That is the best game to have multiplayer and missions on. On that game the graphics, sound, and display are as good as they come."
2,Mediocre,"i have never played the previous bond games. however, i know that as a game it is an [imitation]. the map design is sophomoric at best try Deus EX instead for a real experience with covert first person shooting/role playing."
1,It (stinks),"I've only once played the game James Bond 007 Agent Under Fire, but that was enough for me to know it was one of the stupidest games ever made. It totally (stinks), it's boring, the graphics (stink), the object of this game is mean ,dumb, ignorant , and down right horrible. the violence is gruesome. I don't know why you would wont to play this game?compaired to Sly Cooper it doesn't even come close.in my opinion this game (stinks).I would have used other words to describe this game but the guide lines wouldn't have allowed it, TOO BAD."
3,Nahhhh.,"This game features the worst PS2 controls I've ever seen. The levels are incredibly linear and unoriginal. The ""James Bond"" looks like a Roger Moore knockoff and sound like none of the movie Bonds.The first-person shooting levels were awful.This game's only saving graces were the driving sequences and the cut scenes.I have yet to play a 007 game (Including Goldeneye) that lived up to what it could have been.This game is worth renting, but pass on buying it, unless it's in the bargain bin."
5,Makes Nightfire look like a night light *YAWN*,"Agent under fire is soo much better than Nightfire. Sniper Rifles are cool! you can shoot through walls and other cool stuff with it. Great storyline, especialy Agent Niteshade and Bond. In my opinion, Bond in this looks soo much cooler and more mature than that sorry wanabe fathead bond in Nightfire. The car levels are a little tedious and confusing, but the rail levels are sweet! In one you get heat vision gogles and a tank!!Pros:Great animation!Rail levels are AWESOME!!!Sleek voices and sounds!One of the strongest multiplayer bonds *looks evily at wall where bomb is planted while laughing like a goon*FUN!Cons:Sometimes gets glitchyAI only roll and takes them seven seconds to shoot you (way long)Sometimes there are unreasonable kills for both sides (on the last level we beat it by throwing a grenade while we were already in a pit(dead)."
5,Bond is the Bomb,"The names Bond...James Bond...In Agent under fire!This game is one of the best PS2 games out of many, the single player is outstanding and it keeps you entertained for as long as you want, no matter how many times you beat it, the single player mode has so much stuff to do, (like getting the awards) and the multiplayer never gets boring (especially with a multi-tap) I love this game, and recommend it to all Bond fans, it is definatly the best bond video game i've ever played...if you got a PS2...get out there and buy it now...the graphics are amazing and it isn't sensless violence...it's Bond! The only bad thing is that you can't get doubles of any weapon."
3,"It's okay (Item review, not content)","Hello. I haven't read this book yet, so I can't speak to the content. My review of 3 stars is based on the fact that the font is really small. So, this book is a great bargain price, but not for people with vision problems."
4,Phantom Review,"Great purchase, I don't regret it at all! Disc came in a timely fashion, didn't wait too long. Love the quality of the Bluray! Blows away standard DVDs by miles. I'm very satisfied with this purchase and how quickly it arrived at my home, even as I'm living in Hawaii... A+!"
5,HD DVD really shines,"I was really unimpressed and dissapointing with SD DVD that came out a couple of years back, and wished i could see it in all it's glory.Well, witht the invenion of HD/Blu-ray, I'm happy to say that the HD-DVDis nothing short of STUNNING.Amazing Picture, and fantastic Sound (esp on Dolby TrueHD), this one is a keeper.5/5 HD-DVD."
5,Unbelievable,"I would easily give this movie fifteen stars, if that were at all possible.I've never seen the Broadway show, but once I rented this movie, I was (and still am...) crazy about it!Definatly a haunting love story.I wouldn't reccomend this to kids under ten...the hanging of Joseph Buquet and the fairground scene can be found...disturbing.Three cheers for the Phantom of the Opera!"
5,Gerard Butler as Phantom,"Anyone who wanted Michael Crawford for the Phantom need have no doubts that Gerard Butler will be as good as, if not better, than Mr. Crawford. I love Michael Crawford, but I have also seen Gerard Butler, and he has the passion and the voice to pull if off. I have no doubt that he will be as unforgettable as Michael Crawford, if not more so."
5,I love this movie.,If you want to really experience 'the phantom of the opera' get this DVD. the stage version doesn't compare.
2,Who on earth cast Gerard Butler??!!,"Fine film let down by the well-below par Gerard Butler, who has absolutely zero charisma. And what happened to the Phantoms face?! He is meant to be a grotesque - that's the whole point of the exercise - yet this guy is a Calvin Klein model under his mask! Emmy Rossum is very sweet and has a fine voice for one so young and it's a shame she is let down by such a poor leading man. You only have to see the rather fleeting glimpse of Michael Crawford in the documentary section and the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. That's how it should be done."
1,phantom of the opera hd-dvd,Speaking as someone who has watched the dvd version 100+ times. The soundtrack of the hd-dvd is wretched. I have a arcam 300 with 100 watts per channel with all channels driven receiver. AT maximum volumn the sound level is so low that you might as well be listening to dinner music while reading a book. Fans of the dvd should stay away from this one.
4,It's all about the music!!!,"What it boils down to is the music. And it is here that the movie version of the incredible stage play fails. Emmy Rossum is the one bright spot. She alone makes you glad you're listening. If they can dub Minnie Driver - why in the world did they not dub the two male leads. I *KNOW* that there have to be better singers' voices that could have been used. Josh Groban for instance.I will probably rewatch it in the future, but I will want to play the original cast recording as I mute the television. Otherwise, it was beautiful and wonderful to have another chance to *see* my favorite stage play, instead of only in my mind's eye."
3,Phantom of the Opera,"After seeing the show on Broadway, you would expect to hear beautiful voices and in this movie I did not hear that. The acting was excellent, however when Hollywood makes a movie out of a broadway musical they should turn to the real professional singers."
5,Beautiful,This movie was simply beautiful I loved it and suggest it to anyone :) the phantom of the opera was one of the best movies I've ever seen
5,Phantom of the Opera,Excellent and the music is perfect. The Play is wonderful as well. A must see for all ages. Don't miss it while on Broadway.
5,Great DVD,"What a wonderful movie. The live show would be spectacular, as a recording on DVD, as well. Can't believe Emma Rossum went from Christine to Fiona, in Shameless."
1,disgusted from Miami Beach,"Sound track comes in and out. If I adjust my speakers for the silent parts, then I damage my speakers when the sound returns at a very high level. Mybe I got a bad version."
1,Worst ever!,"Wish I could give negative stars...this would be -10, at least. I'm not opposed to musicals, but this was so slow and boring, it was painful...pure torture trying to sit through it! I finally broke...and hit the fast-forward, and it still sucked. The only reason I can imagine that this film has garnered such praise, is the ever expanding stupidity of our general population. Watching this had to have killed brain cells - avoid it! Watch something of quality - ""Remains of the Day"", ""The English Patient"", ""The Long Engagement"", ""Heat and Dust"", ""Howard's End""...and I could go on and on since there are thousands of outstanding productions - a list on which the ""Phantom of Cr*p"" will never deserve to be."
2,Is this a film?,"This film is a spectacular show but, what else? Excuse me, but I wanted to see a movie and all I have is like putting some cameras in a Broadway theatre to watch the full entire version of the musical.Moreover, what we see in this ""film"" are not actors themselves. They are great singers but not actors. Emmy Rossum has the same face expression all along the film: is she scared, delightful, dreaming? I wonder. Another thing is: why the frontier between the ugly and the pretty is so wide? No twist is possible.Music: perfect. Scenario: brilliant. Make-up and custome design: alright. All static matters are superior. But the film is very poor in performance, development and plot. In fact I don't like the original story. It is so simple: to kill for love...Broadway is in your nearest cinema or your video-club. The musical genre has lost its interest. Chicago and Moulin Rouge are much better, as we see more action, more stories, more glamour. This Phantom of the Opera is out-of-date."
4,really good,"Guess I'm the last person on the planet to have finally seen this movie and only because my brother was raving about how good it was. For me it was no Les Miserables' (2012) version but a close second. I could not believe Emmy Rossum was only 18 when she made the movie or Gerard Butler played the Phantom - he sings, who knew?!I was invested in the characters from the very beginning and actually watched it twice."
5,Great,My boyfriend loves The Phantom of the Opera and I bought this to go with the soundtrack. He absolutely enjoys it. Thanks for helping me make him happy.
3,THE PHANTOM of the OPERA,"If you saw this show on Broadway, you'll probably be disappointed. But, if not, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. The songs are wonderful, the female star has a melodic voice, and the two male leads are very good. The story is a bit far-fetched, but still worthwhile. The costuming is terrific."
4,Very Well done,"I really enjoyed watching this with my daughter. They handled it so well, the sets were beautiful and the story was more touching than the older versions I have seen, mainly because the Phantom was so sympathetic."
2,...I don't get it,"Seriously...what's the big deal?I've never seen the stage show, but I bet it was a whole lot better than the film. I expected to be treated to a fabulous musical, much on the scale of 'Chicago' and 'Moulin Rouge.' Instead, I was treated to an ameatur technical filming of a fabulous set.There are plenty of shots where you can actually see the shadow of the camera, and the editing and photography of certain shots left me confused and dissapointed.The actors are too young, too bland for their roles. The music was overbearing and somewhat annoying. The plot seemed to draw out endlessly, the corpses of the actors didn't help. All of these actors are EXCELLENT actors, but their talent has been wasted on this film.Joel Schumacher too is an excellent director, he just seemed to get lost on this one.The sets and costumes are brilliant, I will say that. They're the only aspect that saved the production.Meanwhile, I respect those that enjoy it so wonderfully, I just don't understand why."
1,Major Disappointment,"I am so glad I rented The Phantom of the Opera before considering purchasing it. This would have been a fairly decent movie had Gerard Butler not been cast as the Phantom. My ex's caterwauling to the Broadway CD was more pleasant-sounding! The only thing that was salvagable was the plotline of Christine Daae and Raoul. That was well-played, and not overdone, which was the downside of the Broadway musical.If this had been a strictly acting movie, Gerard Butler would be a halfways decent Phantom. But his singing killed the mood for me."
5,good,I personally have never seen this but my friend loves it so I got it for her as a gift. She was happy with it so its a great purchase.
3,Oh My Gerard,"Let me start off by saying that Phantom of the Opera is pure genius, but it takes the right characters to show the beauty of the story. I feel that the female role was flawless, but Gerard lacked passion. His words seemed falsified."
5,=) very happy,"The dvd was in great condition, the movie is exactly what I expected and it was wide screen. No complaints here.On the movie it's self: If you have not seen it before, but know the Broadway musical, some of the songs have changed just slightly.Also, though I think the actors/ actresses did a splendid job in the move, being that they are not professional opera singers, they do not compare to the music of the Broadway play (far less voice range)."
4,Straight-out Fabulous,"It's raw, it's sexy, it's lush, it's romantic, and, yes, just a little pretentious. Phantom the movie is straight-out fabulous.While a movie by its very nature lacks the immediacy and energy of a stage production, it also allows for nuances that are impossible on stage. ""Phantom"" takes advantage of these possibilities. The backstage life of the Opera, the outdoor scenes, the ability to go into tight focus then pull back, are all part of the movie's strengths. If Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler lack the classic voices of the stage, they more than make up for it in looks. (Especially Gerard Butler. Mmmm.) Film is, after all, a visual medium.The costumes are wonderful, the choreography breathtaking--I love this movie!"
2,Had excellent potential,"This movie wasnt a total failure, but was by no means a success. Whether the phantom was a little better looking than he should of been is not my gripe. My gripe is that he was supposed to have the most amazing voice ever. He's the key person that is supposed to out sing every one in the story. But he's the one that sucks. I mean, I know I can sing so I dont open my mouth. Why oh why did they cast this guy. I read a review about there being 11 other people that have played the phantom. Hell, why didnt they just take those voices or something. I mean, he REALLY doesnt do the role justice. I would of been happier if even Raoul sang the phantom.The movie still did give you some of the feeling you get at the theater in that when that chandelear goes up, you are all psyched! :)"
3,it don't hold a candle to the broadway show,"overall, an OK movie. Emmy Rossum is great in the role of Christine, and That Other Guy is pretty good as Raoul (minus the goofy hair). visually, this film is as impressive as any, and the vocals are mostly solid.the only real problem here is Gerard Butler. cast as the Phantom, Butler has a powerful, intimidating presence and a sinister countenance. but his voice just doesn't cut it. his voice lack both the power and skill to sing the Phantom's roll. he seems incapable of performing vibrato, and his voice breaks into a a harsh scream in places where he is exerting himself while singing (like at the beginning of DOWN ONCE MORE). he also seems to lack the impressive range necessary to play thePhantom.so again, generally a good movie. i just hated Gerard Butler. and i'm usually a Gerard Butler fan. not here though. way to go, Joel Schumacher! couldn't you have at least given us the courtesy of finding a TALENTED Phantom?"
5,I was enchanted,"I never understood the lure of ""Phantom."" Friends who'd seen the stage version all raved about it, but when I saw it I was left with that awe they'd all had.Until I saw this movie... I don't know what it was about it, but it captivated me. I can watch it again, and again, and again and still want to see it yet again."
3,leave the Mask On,"On the whole , a very intertaining movie. Not as scarey as the original or as musical as the one on Broadway, but certainly worth the watch on a long Winter afternoon."
5,Love/Obsession through Music,"I really enjoyed this musical, this is a timeless theme of love vs obsession. I know nothing is as good as live theater, but this is the next best thing."
4,Very Good Movie for low price,Have always enjoyed the music and have seen the musical both on Broadway and locally. Saw the movie when first out and wanted to see again. Checked Amazon and there it was for a low price. Added it to another purchase so I could get free shipping. Watched the DVD with a friend last wekk and enjoyed both the music and the movie all over again.
3,Really good but....,"Visually, the movie was good. I liked the first scene a lot with the changing of the theater. BUT.............They lip-synched EVERYTHING! I did not even know that Minnie Driver did not do her own songs, but she was the ONLY ONE who looked like she was actually singing! It is IMPOSSIBLE to sing very high notes with your mouth barely open and your face hardly moving. If your are singing while walking fast, your going so sound out of breath, which did not happen here. It would have been fine, but the whole time, I was very annoyed by the mouthing of the songs. If they sang their own songs, and since they are actors/actresses they should know how to act like they are singing. It's not that hard, just open your mouth a wee bit more!"
2,Disappointing,"Quite frankly, I was extremly disappointed. The Phantom of the Opera is my absolute favorite musical and I was looking foward to seeing the movie. I have seen the Phantom on stage and loved it. I also own the Original Cast Recording which is absolutely phenomenal.Gerard Butler was miscast as the Phantom. He doesn't have the voice to have a lead role in a musical. He sounded like he had a horrible cold the entire movie. He couldn't reach the high or low notes and barely held those in between. The acting was mostly bland and some scenes were way too creepy for my taste. Raoul looked ridiculous and Christine seemed awfully stiff and rigid the whole movie. Did she ever change expressions?All in all the movie just didn't live up to my expectations."
3,Picture Quality,"I already owned the dvd, but expected to get better picture quality from the blu-ray. It's a huge let down after watching the blu-ray on my sony BDP S350. Really can't tell the difference. So my word of advice - if u already got the dvd, and u can play it on a DVD player with upscaling function, better save your money from buying the blu-ray version.Lee in HK"
5,Something to remember by,"After you get used to Sarah Brightman's Christine, it's hard to accept any other version of Christine.After you have fallen into sleep by Michael Crawford's phantom countless nights, there is, almost no another Phantom can take his place.However, either you have been or not have been to the live stage show, you definitely will appreciate the authentication of this production.Sir Andrew Lloyd Webb spared nothing to bring this to the silver screen and I am really glad it turns out well, even though it failed to fetch any win from Oscar.It would be strange, very strange ( even a bit creepy ) to see Sarah Brightman or Michael Crawford to repraise their title roles in this movie, but the young and new comer did their roles justice and I successfully combined both beautiful voice of original production and image of new lavish production into my memory banks for this musical number."
4,Don't Miss It,"Having seen several stage productions and now the movie, the only weak area was the Phantom. The visuals are not to be missed - spectacular! I found all the performances to be superb, with the exception of the Phantom. If you've never read the play you'll get much more about the history and story of the Phantom than from the play. I found the new ending to be excellent. This would easily have been 5 stars were it not for the Phantom. Still a great visual and audio feast not to be missed!"
4,Good movie with a good cast except.....,"I really liked the movie. I swear, I did. However, I absolutely hated Gerard Butler's voice as the Phantom. He acted it well, but his voice was absolutely horrific! Especially after such a wonderful singer like Michael Crawford. So...if you are looking for a good movie, go ahead and see it, but do not hold too high expectations for Butler's voice."
5,Wonderful!,"Every thing I expected and more! When something moves me to tears, it has touched my heart. Ladies, prepare to fall in love."
5,Great Music and fantastic cast of acting,"I have loved the music since I saw the play. But only appreciated the music as I was so far back the play meant litte, except I knew the story. But to see it on huge screen and have wonderful singer actors bursting out so well in song and the story being told in such beautiful sets...............make me want to see more great plays on the big screen . I hope it does not stop here.....can you hear the music.................yes still"
4,Phantom of the Opera,"What a love story and how tragic it was. But love prevails and releases the hold on what is not the phantom's to have. His heart breaks and mine along with it, but all is well. The movie drives me to tears."
4,Pre Broadway viewing,Was good to view prior to seeing the play on Broadway. It was a little different than the broadway play.
2,"Nice production, but too long and slow","Andrew Lloyd Webber is a fine composer, and frankly one of my favorite repeat viewing experiences is Evita. The Phantom of the Opera is a quality production, but I simply couldn't finish it. The story line is not complex, but the length of time taken to crawl through it, together with what does not to me comprise very lively and interesting music for the most part (what is largely ""connecting"" music, where words are sung in barely melodic snatches merely because the medium is operatic), caused me ultimately to turn it off, satisfied that I had understood the idea well enough and somewhat frantic to end the tedium. Some of the story line and acting insulted the intelligence, with conflicts being prolonged unrealistically and unnecessarily, and that element didn't help, either. Anyway, this work turned out to be a large disappointment for me, all the more considering the fine body of works that have come from this man's creative pen."
5,Phantom of The Opera,"Well, as seen in the trailer and seen on television this must be one of the best refilmed movies of The Phantom of The Opera.But I am not sure if this movie is also gonna play in Europe.. Although I like to see it ofcourse. So I think I wil order it as soon it is availble here. I hope you will do the same if you can't see it because I am allmost sure it is worth it!greetings,Michel from the Netherlands"
3,Questionable Phantom,"I have always love the stage version of The Phantom of the Opera. Though not faithful to the orginal novel, I still found it to be a great creation that showed a more favorable image of the Phantom. I was overjoyed when I heard that there was a movie of the stage version in the works. I knew that Sarah Brightman was not going to play the lead but I had rather hoped that Michael Crawford was going to play the part of the Phantom. Some may not consider him to be the ideal for the big screen but he has proven himself over and over to be the perfect Phantom.I am curious to see the film but after seeing the preview online, I am doubtful of the finished product. The preview seems campy and almost cheap. This is not how the stage version is. It is lushous, dark and emotional and this does not come across in the preview.I am worried that this movie may harm the stage version as so many cross-overs have. Only when the movie comes out can this be determined."
5,PTO Love,LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! LOVE THE DVD. you like music? Like PTO? this is a great buy! if somehow I lost my DVD I can honestly say I'd buy this again in a heart beat!!!
4,phantom of the opera,We have not had time to view this CD. I have seen a rented copy and wanted a personal copy so I could watch it at my leisure.
1,Phantom of the Opera and 3000 to Gracelands,"Hi,I am really quite upset about this! I have already sent an email last week with comments that both of these DVD's have arrived in tact and so I've throw the packaging away only to find that they are both Region 1 (America and Canada) and not Region 2 (UK and Europe).My question was how do I return the items without the correct packaging or invoice/delivery note? And how do i get you to send me the correct ones? They are presents for Mothers Day (this coming weekend) and so now I will have to disappoint my mum as I presume I'll not hav ethem in time so cannot give her the presents I had planned! Nobody has come back to me at all and I was dissapointed in Amazon to start with for the wrong DVD's being sent but I am even more disappointed now at the lack of customer aftercare.Please come back to me asap to see if we can rectify the issue!Thank You,Joanne Bloomfield"
1,I NEVER RECEIVED THE ITEM!,"I ordered The Phantom of the Opera DVD on the same day as I ordered the Shawshank Redemption. I received the Shawshank Redemption, but still have not received the Phantom of the Opera. It was supposed to be a birthday gift for my fiance. Please send it to me! If I don't recieve it, I would like a full refund. Thank you very much."
2,"Butler Big Mistake, this is a waste of money","The production values and direction for the film are exceptional, unfortunately the miscasting of a musicless miscreate leading man in Butler sinks this film. I purchased this DVD for Christmas for my wife because she loves the musical so much. I have seen sections of the musical on video with Michael Crawford and although not a great singer at least he can do more than shout lyrics. Gerard Butler is absolutely horrendous in this role since it's obvious he can't carry a tune even in a bucket. Geez, they dubbed Minnie Driver, why not dub this catawahling catastrophe? Shouting a song is not singing. Horrid."
4,"Passion, Sorrow, Artistry and Shirt Ruffles","As someone old enough to have seen the original stage production with the sensation that is Michael Crawford, I wasn't much interested in the film version, which was released in December 2004 to unfavorable and dismissive reviews. However, now, having seen this new release by Joel Schumacher, I wonder what all the criticism was all about. While the story has morphed from the original Lon Chaney version, it has happily evolved into a classic that will be watched for years to come. Gerard Butler as the Phantom, and Emmy Rossum and Christine, shine in their roles and bring a compassion and vulnerability not seen before in this drama. The director, Mr. Schumacher, infuses his film with the deeply caring hand and eye of an artist. This release is destined to find its way into the film collectors' catalog as one of our favorite classics."
5,Great video,Better than the stage show. More story detail. The music is just as great as the original music.
5,I'm glad I bought it :D,"Definitely worth the money :D In the special features, there's a scene where Gerry Butler sang No One Would Listen. It's a very beautiful song. You can feel the softer side if the Phantom :D Unfortunately it was taken out from the actual movie :( You also get to watch the ""history"" of POTO... How it developed and how Andrew Loyd Webber started composing the musicals. :D"
5,Phantom Fantastic!,"Wow what an incredable experience The Phantom of the Opera Musical movie was. What a feast of talent. The orchestra sensational the actors just incredable, the screenplay so wonderful, romantic and moving. I and many of my friends left the movie thinking hmm when can we make the time to see it again! I just cant say enough good things about it! I cant wait for the DVD to come out. I hope it gets some oscars it deverves to for sure!"
2,Disappointing DVD,"The DVD of Phantom of the Opera was disappointing because the sound was recorded at such a low level as to be barely audible. I suspect it might be a pirated copy from China. We won't be buying any more DVDs from Amazon. Unfortunately we threw away the return information or I would have sent it back. If I spend another $250 for an amplifier and speaker system for my TV, we may be able to enjoy the music, which was the main reason we bought the DVD."
5,Just like sitting in a Broadway theater seat,"I have seen the movie and LOVED IT!!! I'm a huge fan (have seen the Broadway show three times in New York and San Fran). It was like watching the play. And the music was awsome!!! Christine (Emmy Rossum)was as good if not better that Sarah Brightman!!! If you love the Broadway play, go see the movie!!"
2,Not very good.,"Well, this wasn't the first 10 bucks I wasted, and it wont be the last.Just a poorly done movie of a classic operetta. The sets, scenery, and morphing of scene to scene got so annoying, I had to watch in two parts.The only voice that was excellent, was the dubbed in voice of Carlotta. It took me a while to find out who owned that glorious voice.It belonged to Margaret Preece.Listening to her was worth the 10 dollars.Sometimes, you can ruin a masterpiece by trying to outsmart the genius behind the masterpiece.Maybe they decided to put loads of ketchup on top of a filet mignon to cover the weak and poor singing talents cast into this production; trying to cover it with hideous scenery and morphing!Too bad!Thank you,Fred Auerbach"
5,"RJ from Blacksburg, VA","Excellent!! The movie is much better than the Broadway production - better character development, better acting, better singing. Madame Giry is a much more intriguing character in the film. Christine's attraction to the Phantom is more understandable and believable. Plus, we get to see the Phantom's past and why he is the way he is.In response to the comment about the sword fight: The Phantom would know very little about fencing because he's lived alone beneath an opera house all his life. You must practice fencing to become good at it.All of my family members (ages from 10 to 47) highly recommend the film version of The Phantom of the Opera. (good music, comedy, suspense, romance, lavish costumes and sets)"
4,Beautiful to look at,"I have heard some better singing, but this is an enjoyable film and CD. Probably not going to be a favorite of the straight operatic singer, or the high brow composer, but it appeals to the masses. And music to the masses is very important."
5,THIS MOVIE WILL BE A CLASSIC SOMEDAY!,You heard me. This film is great! This has got to be the best Phantom Of The Opera ever. Andrew Lloyd Weber was a musical genius and Joel Schumacher is a great director (he redeemed himself after the disaster of the Batman films 3 & 4 with this movie). This is one of the best musical movies ever made. Anyone who is interested in the classic story of The Phantom Of The Opera should check out this masterpiece.
3,"WOW, worth every timeless minute!","This is truly a classic, The photography was incredible the movie was written well. The mistakes made in the film very obvious!!! Yet you really don't mind seeing a string down Butlers neck and one eye one color one moment then another color later. You sort of overlook the imperfections and fall in love with the character Erik. Gerard Butler did an amazing job, yet I do think at times he needed work on developing his character better, He was all over the place at times. You can still hear the scottish accent the actor has. Yet his singing was unique and went well with the character. All in all well worth it and enjoyed every minute of it. Rossum was almost perfect but a bit too young. Minnie Driver I thought was terrible. The fainting scene in the carriage was not funny, it was truly a bad performance. The rest of the film was great."
4,LONG LIVE THE PHANTOM----,"The original production with Michael Crawford was SPECTACULAR-But this production is noteworthy.Kudos to Gerard Butler, who turns in a good performance as the Phantom! (Will wonders never cease???)Beautiful art direction, costumes and... the MUSIC OF THE NIGHT!"
1,What ?,"I live the ""Phantom of the opera"" so I ordered the DVD. Well the 1st thing I noticed was it was in a different type of packaging . Blue Ray DVD's come in a Blue package. Regular DVD's come in clear or white. case. But this one is in a ""Red"" case. It would not play in my VCR or even my computer ( That can play anything ). I contacted the seller and their reply was "" Oh yea it is in a different format sorry"" Well?????? What are you going to do about it?? Yea Yea I only spent like 5 dollars on it but still if they did this to over 100 people then they got $500. for worthless DVD'S.Don't give them a dime more.!!!!!!!"
2,NO,"I'd love to leave a one word review in the form of my review title, but that's impossible. Butler is a feast visually, but he does NOT have Michael Crawford's voice. Emmy Rossum looks lost throughout the entire production. Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson saved this otherwise lackluster production."
5,A splended addition to any family's collection,"This movie is a masterpiece. The casting is just exquisite, Gerard Butler uses so much emotion as the phantom, and Emmy Rossum is the perfect Christine. The scenery is detailed, and fits well in the victorian era. I loved the elegance and charm of this film, as well as the dark, mystic effect the phantom seems to carry with him. In this movie, an opera star leaves the theater in a huff, and a chorous girl, Christine, takes her place. When she sings, her former ""sweetheart"", Roul, recognizes her, and they are swept up into a romance. The phantom, however, sees them, and takes Christine away to the catacombs where he has made into an elegant home. Soon after, they return, and Roul and Christine become engaged. The phantom becomes angry, and is set on making Christine his own bride. He devises a plan to take her away from Roul and keep her in his darkness forever. This movie is a definate must see."
1,Call me crazy,"Call me crazy, but I think the lead in a musical should be able to sing. Gerard Butler is, in a word, terrible. My sister-in-law says it is OK, the villain doesn't have to have a good voice. Nonsense. The Phantom seduces her with his magnificent music. That is rather the point. I cannot see anyone being seduced by his yowling."
2,Nothing compared to the Broadway production.,"After all the hype I heard about this movie I finally watched it and was severly disappointed. Some of the music is watered down and the actors leave much to be desired (in singing and acting).If you want a good audio recording of this I recommend the ""The Phantom of the Opera (Original 1986 London Cast)"" CD. It leaves out some story but still leaves you satisfied. Also the singers are much better than in the movie. However, if you can't sit still for about an hour and just listen to a CD of this great performance, I guess you'll just have to settle for the poorer performance given in the movie."
3,Big and Beautiful....with some flaws,"Phantom of the opera has the music, but it's missing something. The cast seems out of place and takes away from the film. Set design was great, music was too. A little long and tedious at parts."
2,Disappointing singing -- and not much to make up for this,"Two centuries from now, Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals will be hailed as the natural creative extension of opera verite that reached it's high point with Puccini's works.Although, Phantom was a phenomenal success as a stage musical, this movie version disappoints as much as the ill-fated Attenborough version of ""A Chorus Line"". As other reviewers have noted, the principles voices just don't match the excellent original (stage) cast recording (Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman) and unlike ""Evita"" where the movie orchestrations enriched and extended the stage musical, there's nothing new here.If you are living on a desert island, have never seen Phantom on the stage, and you are curious, you might just buy this. But if you've seen the original, you are likely to be quite disappointed."
2,"First Part Was OK, then ...........","The first part of the movie was OK. I had seen the show at the Kennedy Center years before, and loved it. I had the CD for about a year, and played it all the time when I was driving to and from work. And knew all the songs and music. I also bought the music book.I couldn't wait to see the show, and I wasn't disappointed. It was great. I watched it today on a DVD I'd had for a couple years; maybe because tomorrow is Halloween. I was greatly disappointed after the first half hour. Parts of it were like the show and parts of it looked like they were just stuck in. Most of it was pretty bad. I didn't watch it till the end. I prefer to remember the real show. The movie was somebody's interpretation, and his interpretation had little to do with Phantom.I give it 2 stars because some of the vocals were OK."
2,Stage show lovers don't buy this dvd.,"If you love Phantom from the stage show, you will be very disappointed with the quality of the singing in this movie. If they were going to lip sync anyway, why didn't they hire spectacular singers? The only shining star is Raoul. The rest are weak at best, except the voice over for Carlotta (Minnie Driver plays the character). I love the stage show and the music CD but this is a big disappointment. The costumes and special effects are well done but when the show is all about the music and that part is lacking, the costumes and special effects don't really matter."
1,Bad Singing!,I loved Phantom when I saw Michael Crawford in the lead role on Broadway. So I popped this disc into my player with reat anticipation. What a letdown! No one in the cast can sing! Avoid at all costs.
2,AVOID MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!,"If you love Phantom of the Opera, then do yourself a favor and stay away from this retched movie! Everything is pitch corrected, Gerard Butler is God-awful as the Phantom, the overall singing is bland, and the magic of the musical is nonexistent in this movie! The only reason why I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is out of respect for the other outlets that got me familiar with Phantom. Watch the 25th anniversary concert for the appropriate way to view this Phabulous musical. If you haven't seen this already, skip over it and watch the concert version, you'll thank me in an alternate dimension where you regrettably viewed this pile of rubbish."
5,End in Tears,"omg, this is my favorite movie. i'm listening to the soundtrack for it right now. if you haven't seen this movie, please go and rent it.Gerade Bulter (Gerry!) was a very good Phantom. *winks* Emmy Rossum played a good Christine, and i'll give some points to Patrick Wilson for a very good Rauol. Jennifer Ellison (Meg Giry) was good too, although i wanted to see more of her in the movie.The end is what had me crying. *weep,weep* oh, i have an idea!One word: sequel!!!!!! that's what we need phans! a sequel... maybe an Erik and Meg love story. Sorry. i'm an Erik/Meg love phan. btw, a phan is the correct term for the ""Phantom of the Opera"" fan.I don't wanna say to much more or i'll give away the movie (that is, unless you've seen the movie/play or read the book.One more thing, i want to give some points to Joel Schumacher(sp?) for being a very good director, and ALW for good composing."
1,See the Show - Don't buy the movie,"As an avid theatre-goer, I have seen many musicals throughout my life. The first musical I ever saw was ""Phantom of the Opera"". So I became enthralled when the movie was to be coming out. However, to my disappointment, the movie is lost in the visual spectacle that isn't even all the great to begin with. Why Lloyd Weber chose Schumacher as the director for this film is beyond my reasoning. Did he see ""Batman Forever""? Honestly, the entire movie lacks the emotional power of the stage production, as well as the talent. The voices are bad, the acting is horrific, and the overall structure is slow moving and robotic. The actors knew nothing about musical performance. This is why I give this movie such a bad rating."
1,This was B A D,"Oh lord was this horrible. The only redeeming feature of this movie was the phantom himself, and that's not to insinuate his acting was by any means extraordinary. There is one part at the end when Raoul just stands there weeping like a woman while the phantom loosely wraps him in some weak excuse for a noose, and he supposedly can't ""break"" free. Oh boy was this silly. The only musical rendition of this that could not beat this stupid movie is the one showing in your nine year old's back yard. NOBODY who has seen this on Broadway and has any sense would claim this even remotely compares in quality. If this is the best we can come up with than our society is sorely lacking, my friends."
5,A powerful and wonderfully made love story!,"This movie captures the awesome theatrical elements seen in-person! If you've seen it live, this movie will not disappoint you."
4,Phantom of the Opera,"My daughter loves broadway music and this movie is fantastic. Every thing in it is very good. Good acting, good musical."
5,Phantom of the Opera DVD (Gerard Butler),"The best version of this wonderful story I have ever seen and i have seen many versions. I would recommend this for all ages, my 10 year old and 15 year old nieces loved it as well as my husband..."
5,amazing,This has always been a favorite in my home. I could watch this movie over and over again. Very Happy
2,What I Thought...,"If you've never seen the broadway production, you very well may like this movie. I, however, have. I was highly disappointed with this movie. The vocals were not even remotely comparable and most of acting was just plain bad. This movie, in no way, did justice to the REAL thing."
2,Greatly Disappointed,"I've seen the Broadway show several times and have owned the original CD for since 1989, I am very familiar with the music and the stunning performances by Michael Crawford. It was a major blunder on Llyod Weber's part to not enlist Michael Crawford as the Phantom.The movie (and the play) is about the Phantom. It is there that the performances should be the strongest, the richest and the most powerful of voice. Sadly this new phantom has none of these traits... your average rock singer (limited talent) could have sung this role better.I have no malice towards Gerard Butler, I'm sure he is a fine actor. But he should never have been cast for this role. Instead of The Phantom standing out it's more of a backdrop. Even it they couldn't cast Michael they should have considered someone who has taken voice or who could sing. Perhaps Butler should have remained a lawyer."
1,Compatible 'Phantom',"My stupidity. Buying from the U.S. I had forgoten that their D.V.D. system and ours are not compatible. Don't get caught. I did, having bought Eric Clapton and not being able to play it either!!!!!!!"
5,A lovely movie,"I've seen this movie five times, and watched my favorite scenes over and over again for countless times. And it is soo much better than the play. For some reason everyone compared gerry butler's voice to michael crawfords, and said that crawford's was better. I thought crawfords sounded horrible! This was revealed when I brought the original london cast cd. Was it really even singing, I think anyone can sound like that. And quite personally I thought it sounded like a clown. And they say Gerry's was horrible... I thought his rock voice and looks, as well as acting were perfect for the phantom. He had to have those qualities to seduce Christine. And please, stop saying it wasn't exactly like the play. In the interview A.L.W said that it wasn't exactly from the play, but it still held the same roots. Rather than that it was a beautiful movie, and I cry in the end all the time. A must buy movie, oh and I love the casting sing along."
1,Horrendous,"I was appalled by the general quality of the film. However, I was more flabbergasted by the ratings given. The jumping scenes are awkward, the acting (especially that of Emmy) is horrendous, and man, the singing, is even worse than being amateurish. Any member from my choir could out-sing Butler or Emmy. I stopped watching after 30 minutes through the film. Honestly, I RARELY give up on a film."
5,hauntingly beautiful,"wow, just mesmorising and haunting.Not only does it stay true to the Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom Of The Opera but it improves it.Everything is high quality, the set design and cotuming is beautiful, the direction brilliant and the performances are enchanting.The music and the tale will last with you long after viewing"
1,How to Wreck a Classic,"A Phantom without a soul. A singer without a voice. And strange comic things inbetween...Sorry, is this Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera?Phantom of the Opera is a song of seduction not a song to get a horse down one flight of steps or to display hands holding candles like a cheap Train of Horror's ride.Shouting the Music of the Night draws no sympathy from anyone - although it may raise interest from the looney-bin.Madame Giry compassionate lover? Perhaps she should have been Christine because she took all the understanding for the Phantom that Christine should have had.If a chandelier falls into an orchestra pit, why does the roof explode like an a-bomb on Hiroshima?Back up dancers for Pass the Point of No Return? Oh brother...Cheap Caberet at its worst.Every song ruined beyond imagination. Would the OG please send a note to JS regarding how this movie should have been..."
3,"Faithful to the play, but the voices are lacking","The movie is very close to the play. All the songs are there. Unfortunately, the actors' voices are dissapointing. The phantom, especially, could use at least ten more years of music lessons.Also, the movie does not have the dark quality of the play. Bright lights and colors make it more of a farce than a frightening and mysterious experience."
3,Gerard who?,"I was really surprised at how good this film was. I did not expect much and it was quite glorious. I loved the black and white beginning and how it ""transforms"" into color. I loved the background of the Phantom's childhood that we never saw on stage. And the actress playing Christine; holy cow!! But Gerard Butler was very ho-hum as the Phantom. I can't say he was bad, but with a role like this, a good actor can really make a mark and put his stamp on a role. Butler did not do this.Hats off to director Schumacher who, after destroying the BATMAN franchise, rises like a Pheonix to direct a truly sumptuous first rate musical!"
2,NOT SO GREAT,"cinematically, it was beautiful.acting .... meh.but vocally... it hurt.anyone with a vocal or musical theatre background knows the incredible demands of Webber's huge musical. The ONLY way to pull off the story's transfer from stage to screen is to involve fully capable vocalists in the principal roles.the two young lovers (christine and Raoul) did an admirable job, especially Raoul. But as for Gerard Butler [Phantom]..... whoever cast him should be shot.There are SO MANY actors out there who could pull off the role... why on earth they cast someone who couldn't sing to save their lives, I don't know.as a movie, it's beautiful. but if you have any background in voice or musical theatre, spare yourself."
4,free replacemnt 48hr instnt video,"Prime:2-Day Shipping is free,1 item(s)48hr instant video..in regards to this video, its my 1st 1 todate &if i can pls have a free replacemnt as i had trouble with 1st one &then time ran out wout watching it.."
4,A great musical - done right,"It is hard not to like this movie. The music is great! The casting was done well (not perfect), and they spared no cost on the production."
3,"Great movie, lousy Blu-Ray Sound","This is just a quick review of the Blu-Ray version of ""Phantom of the Opera"".The picture quality is great, the audio isn't. The audio on this Blu-Ray is Dolby Digital, which is the lowest quality audio Blu-Ray can use. This is a MUSICAL people! The soundtrack is available on high definition SACD! Why is the audio on this BD Dolby Digital??? The audio has about as much life to it as an mp3 file.If I am expected to pay a premium price for Blu-Ray movies, I expect a premium experience from that movie, and this ain't it."
3,Phantom of the Opera DVD,"I first saw the movie version of Phantom of the Opera before seeing the play onstage and I was not very impressed.However, I was then lucky enough to see the play onstage live, which was spectacular. The difference was unbelieveable. The live play was incredible. I loved it.So now when I look at the movie, I like it a little better, but only because it reminds me of the play. They should have at least used the same actors from the play.Regardless, I'm still going to buy the DVD only because I love the play onstage so much."
3,Could have been so much better.,"I actually enjoyed the movie overall, except for the parts when Gerard Butler opened his mouth. Until he was unmasked and then he could sing all of the sudden. I would have hoped for much more with better casting and stronger singers. I loved Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow, they were superb.Amusing, but not great."
5,grat movie,I love this classic movie...the images are good no problem with the dvd..was very satisfy...the delivery was faster than expected!
2,If youve ever seen the Broadway performance...,"then you will have to be disappointed by this film. Or if you are cynical, somewhat of a purist when it comes to movie adaptations, you will have great cause to laugh and poke fun. The movie is visually decedent in many aspects, but the singing? First of all, the phantom's modern rock star voice doesnt help the fact that he cant carry notes worth a damn. And emily whats her name who plays Christine cannot hit high soprano without wavering and pinching her voice in a cringe-worthy performance. But yes, her skimpy nightgown and sexual suggestiveness when the phantom takes her down to his lair is hilariously ridiculous. Plus the eyelid fluttering during ""point of no return""- subtlety is not an issue here. The first star was for some of the costumes and visual effects: the second? Because this film is more fun to make fun of than any of the films ever featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000"
5,The Best Phantom Yet - Surpasses Stage Production & B&W Film,I can't conceive why there are negative reviews on this fabulous film version of the marvelous stage play! Having seen the play several times and the B&W movie version I have to say that this movie takes the best of all and excels in every way!!! It's such a shame that the 'snobbery' exists that might prevent the public from enjoying this truly magnificent film! It is a work of 'art' and the many times I've seen it the theater has been full of people who are 'spellbound' - consistently. The credit goes largely to the heartfelt performance of Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum. Whatever Mr. Butler was paid it was not enough - considering the energy he put into the role. This film will be lasting and his contribution is vast - a heartfelt 'BRAVISSIMO' for his performance!
3,"visually beautiful, musically disappointing","The best feature of this 2 disc collection is the 2nd CD, giving a very informative history on the painstaking work involved in bringing the novel to life. Those viewers familiar with the original London and Broadway cast, and the perfection of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, will be disappointed. One cannot divide The Phantom into separate entities - play and/or movie: the movie should have been as powerful musically as the theatre production, and it is not. Visually, the movie is a stunning production, but it fails in what should be its greatest draw - performers whose powerful and beautiful voices can deliver the power and beauty of the musical score."
4,SURPRISINGLY GOOD!,"I've never been a huge fan of movie musicals, so I didn't expect too much from ""The Phantom of the Opera."" But, to my surprise, it was actually quite good! The awesome sets, haunting cinematography, fantastic visual effects, and great performances help to elevate it above the sometimes-mediocre songs. Gerard Butler (""Dracula 2000"") made a great Phantom, and Patrick Wilson (""The Alamo"") was good as Raoule, but Emmy Rossum (""The Day After Tomorrow"") gave the film's best performance! She's talented, beautiful, and can sing too! The supporting cast does a good job as well.I recommend the film to all fans of musicals!Movie/DVD Grade: B+"
5,Great recording of excellent musical,"I had purchased the DVD version of this several years ago, and as my review of that version says, rated it highly. I bought the Blue Ray version to compare it to my older DVD and see if it was enough better to justify buying BlueRay versions of some of the DVDs I already owned. I did a 3 way comparison, switching back & forth among the 3 modes as I watched. Mode 1 was the DVD in non-upconverted form, 2 was the DVD upconverted to 1080, and 3 was the BlueRay disk. Although the greatest improvement was between modes 1 & 2, mode 3 was noticeable better than 2. Mode 3 had much sharper detail, especially in the darker areas.For new purchases, I would certainly recommend buying the BlueRay version where it is available even if it cost more, although upconverted DVDs are almost as good and in most cases I would not spend the money to replace DVDs I already had with the BlueRay version."
5,The Phantom of the Opera (Widescreen Edition),"My wife and I love the ""Phantom of the Opera"". Being able to watch a broadway show on big screen TV in the comfort of our home, and not have to pay over hundred dollars for the broadway tickets--this is priceless."
4,Not Just For Opera Lovers,"The Phantom of the Opera (Widescreen Edition)One word describes the quality of this DVD, Incredible. Let me clarify this comment. The condition of the DVD was excellent; however, the contents, the Movie, was incredible. I was skeptacle when my wife suggested I order this DVD. I am not an Opera fan, but I soon found out that Opera in this form can be fun and entertaining. Amazon, you've done it again; you have come through with your promise of quality for the customer.Thanks, Mike"
5,Loved it!,"I have never been to the play version of Phantom of the Opera, so I am not too sure how this compares. I truly love this version. Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum are amazing. It is a very seductive film, and definitely worth the purchase."
5,PHANtastic,"I was truly awed by this movie. I am a huge fan of the musical (I've seen it 3 times) and the movie did not fail. Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson were all excellent. The addition of the swordfight was a great bonus. Two other great additions were the Raoul flashbacks and the additons in the dungeon. The cinematography was excellent. The lyrics were crisp, however the movie did not go without falt. I felt the movie was completly different than the actual stage musical. The most obvious thing was the spoken words. When I first saw Colm Wilkinson in Toronto, Ted Keegan, Brad Little, and listening to the soundtrack of my favorite phantom Michael Crawford, almost everything was sung..not in the movie. Overall, this movie was excellent, and it is definitly a DVD buy for me."
5,The Phantom of the Opera (Gerard Butler),Good movie. Even my 16 year old is really into this movie. She's memorized all the songs and taking voice lessons now....
5,Gerard Butler is AMAZING,This is one of the best movies I have EVER seen. I immediately purchased the soundtrack right after seeing it. I HIGHLY recommend this movie!
4,it's all in your mind,"this movie is such a visually gorgeous film. the sets and the colors are so vivid and bright. everything in the film keeps the action going. the music is tredendous, the story is well-known by all. i have to admit this film does drag at times (probably because i'm not much into musicals) but this film is amazing nonetheless. the gothic-romance horror of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" serves to populate the ages, being remade better and better each time. i have to admit, it was an odd version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" song being played, i mean, it sounded all sythentsized and electronic compared with the rest of the music in the film. i think if they did it the original way it was, minus the synthesized drums and electric guitar, it would have added a more dark and grim appeal. not that this version is bad, it's just weird. Emmy Rossum...yummy, but also an elegant christine vocally. the phantom is awesome too."
5,A masterpiece! Wow!,"Having seen Phantom of the Opera live several times with Crawford, Guillaume, etc. I was very impressed with this movie adaptation. It's hard to capture the power of the state and the music in a movie but I really felt like this is a close second to seeing the Broadway performance. The angst and confusion of Cristine is very well played out. I don't think this story ever gets old. BTW- personal opinion, Raul is her life love and though the Phantom is a dream he isn't someone she can love in reality. Love the ending and the way this was shot! Good work."
4,good,good good good good good it was good i liked it why does this require so many words my goodness
2,Not Up To Scratch,"Honestly, if they are going to make a movie about a masked man - why did they just not use Michael Crawford instead of a man who can not sing! For heaven's sake, I never saw such a stupid set of casting than in this film!"
1,Should never had been made.,"I hated this movie from the terrible beginning to the just as terrible end. There was only one good song throughout the entire thing. There was a love story, but this girl kissed the Phantom, then got with this guy, then kissed the Phantom again. This movie should never had been made. It was a total waste of time. I only wish they had a zero option for stars."
1,Men UNITE,"I think I can speak for all the men in the Amazon audience who were forced to watch this phglem, I mean film, ""Give me back the remote!"" For the love of all that is good, do not make one more weepy musical EVER!"
4,Great movie,Great movie enjoyed it a lot. Loved the music wish i can see it on broadway. Emmy Rossum did great.
2,Major Problem,"This movie had a lot of potential. I did not even mind the changes in the movie from the stage production. BUT, any one with any singing experience knows that it is IMPOSSIBLE to sings these songs without opening your mouth! The leads are all running around singing intense songs with their mouths open a crack. I could not enjoy this movie at all because I knew they were lip syncing. If something like this bothers you, I would avoid this movie. The acting definitely falls flat."
1,The Phantom of the Opera,I still have not received my DVD and it was placed 5 weeks ago. I am very dissatisfied and will never buy through this dealer again.
3,Still #1??,"I am just frighteningly confused as to how this movie has been the #1 top seller on amazon.com for about an entire week! This movie made a fairly low amount in theaters, so I have no clue how it has been #1 for so long, let alone at all. Plus, it's beating out Seinfeld Season 4 for the #1 spot. It just doesn't make any sense to me. I don't have anything to say about the movie, though, so just ignore the number of stars I gave it."
3,Not a clue......,"I have mixed feelings about how this movie will be. I am a huge die-hard Sarah Brightman fan, and I know that whoever is playing Christine isn't gonna come close to matching up to her voice. Although I've never seen the play, I know that basic plot of it, and I know every song by heart. ALW wrote these songs specifically for Sarah's voice and nobody elses. I'm positive that these new actors/actresses simply WILL NOT be as good as Sarah and Michael. I'll go to see it of course to find out for myself how I like it, but I don't have a great feeling. 3 stars for now is ok..."
5,Family favorite,"Strong performances - visually beautiful - this film has captured my family's attention. We're not big movie buffs but will watch this one repeatedly, and then talk about the new things we've discovered with each viewing. Definitely a favorite! The music is mesmerizing."
2,great film but no feeling,"I seen the orginal cast on broadway and then seen it a few years later, when i saw the movie on dvd. It was great but had no real feeling of the story, When i saw it on broadway, i felt for christine, the phantoms torment. don't get me wrong the actors, the production was great, but the story is a love story and should have some emotion to it. i am preferenced to the musical"
3,"On the whole, disappointing","The casting is bad. Gerard Butler as the Phantom is much too charming and way too charming over Raoul, the young and handsome aristocrat whom Christine has fallen in love with. It makes the audience wonder why Christine has chosen Raoul over the Phantom.Raoul's weak voice does not do justice to the songs and thank heavens he sings little. Christine (Emmy Rossum), on the other hand, sings like an angel and is quite marvelous.The storyline is sometimes confusing and disjointed and unrealistic; some parts were unnecessary and unnecessarily long, causing the audience's attention to stray at times during the 2 and half hour movie."
5,VERY pleased,"I was VERY pleased with this item, and the seller. I received the item EXACTLY as promised in the description. I will definitely deal with this seller in the future."
5,My chocolate,"This movie may not have been the best in the world, but it is damn mezmorizing and I had the soundtrack stuck in my head from the first moment I heard it. It still isn't all out. The visuals and costuming are fantastic not to mention the lovely Gerard Butler, who if you don't fall in love with, you are, in my personal opinion, a very sick person. :) I love his rendition of Music of the Night perhaps because I got to see the power of his performance, but if you haven't seen this, see it. If you don't like it, I'm sorry.But this movie is my chocolate. Dark chocolate."
4,Phantom Haunted Reviewer with Emotions.,"I personally found this movie to be a splendid version of the opera. The black and white scenes seemed to be done artistically with the film seeming to be made at the actual date of the setting. Minnie Driver portrayed her diva character beautifully. Throughout the movie, I actually found my spine to be tingly from the emotion the characters did a great job of presenting in this film. Christine and Raoul's scenes together displayed a great longing to be together, but Christine's pull between the Phantom and Raoul was also revealed well. I must admit though, the phantom chosen for the part did a mediocre job in singing. Despite this, I still found the film to be a delight to watch. I will most definitely buy this film when it comes out on DVD, though I usually don't buy many movies."
3,"Not as good as seeing the stage production, but pretty darn good","An eye-filling, gorgeous, no-expenses-spared version of Andrew Lloyd Weber's musical. Many similarities in sets and sequences to the original stage play. It is still a bit stagey, but it has been opened up a bit. The three leads are beautiful in appearance and in voice--this Phantom is hardly disfigured in my opinion, which makes his hiding from the world a little less credible. This film is a feast for the eyes and ears."
5,great quality,"Movie was great quality, would easily buy again. It was brand new and played perfect. Purchased blue ray and I got it within the week"
3,I watch this for Gerry (spoilers),"This is the type of musical I'd normally never buy but I made the exception because I think Gerard Butler is worth it. Even without the mask, with the so-called deformity of one side of his face, he's sexier and better-looking than the Count. It's hard to believe that Christine didn't choose him. The rest of the story I found typically overwrought and full of screeching songs and to be honest, I never got why both men were interested in such an insipid heroine. But let me give Minnie Driver her props: she was pretty good in her role. I wonder why she isn't a bigger star."
5,A great experience,THe special edition was well done and most enjoyable. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.
5,I love it!,"Many people will complain that this version isn't good because Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford didn't perform as the Phantom and Christine. Well, I'm a phanatic. I own 6 books, 5 movies, and 11 soundtracks, and this is one of the best versions of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical that I've heard. No, it cannot compare to the live Broadway show, but it is definately one of the most emotional, most in-depth, best adaptation that I've seen. Gerard James Butler, Emmanuelle Grey Rossum, and Patrick Wilson all did an amazing job with the music. I'm proud to be the generation this was made for. @-P---"
5,"AWSOME MOVIES, CANT STOP WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER","I never liked opera, but this movie is outstanding, special effects are awsome and the music even more awsome. I have watched it over and over again. What a romantic and wonderful film. Not enough stars in the sky to rate it."
2,"The Emporer""s New Clothes","I watched about half of it and left the rest on for background noise. And noise it was! I loved the sets enough to rate this a star higher than I otherwise would. But the ""music"" was ghastly and the acting was way over the top. I read a review here that said that ALW stole large portions of the music from Puccini operas. I don't know about that but I swear to God about 40 minutes into it he does about 8 bars of what some of you may recall from the old DR Demento show as ""Fishheads"" by Barnes and Barnes. You can download the song here: http://www.emp3world.com/to_download.php?id=38805 then listen to the film again. The laugh you get will be the best part of the movie."
4,"Overall, good film","I feel that The Phantom of the Opera was a good film, overall. Unfortunately for anyone who has had the opportunity to see the stage production, it pales in comparison. But in reality, no one can fairly compare the stage and the screen. Both are extremely different avenues. I felt that the movie accurately portrayed the storyline. The actors were extremely well chosen for their respective roles. The only thing that I disliked, however, was the singing voice of Gerard Butler as the Phantom. Although he captured the magic of ""The Music of the Night"" well, the rest of the songs were a bit lacking vocally on his part. His voice was excellent, to say the very least. However, part of the essence of the Phantom character is to have a large, powerful, booming, and mysterious voice. It is meant to make you shudder and be fearful of him. I don't feel like this actor's voice created that emotion in the movie. Again, it was a superb film!"
5,happy,"really great condition, amazing for the price. it's one of my favorite movies so i'm so excited to now own it"
2,Good Grief,"Special Effects? Amazing! Scenery, props, costuming... wonderful.I wish I had never seen it!!!The magic and mystery is killed as soon as the Phantom's mask is pulled of the first time, and it never recovers. I cried with a broken heart after seeing the movie. I am so in love with this play, but I cannot believe that the director chose youth over the neccesary maturity needed for the roles. Emmy has a beautiful voice... she's just not old enough for the part. Raoul is far too young. It's a joke. The Phantom needs to SING! Gerald Butler... he's not good enough.I pray that I can forget the trapdoors shown in the movie, and return myself to the magic world in the stage show. I feel like a child told that there is no Santa.I'm buying the DVD for one reason... the opening sequence, which I will watch over and over again. I'll turn it off after that."
1,A Phantom To Phorever Phorget,"In spite of the lavish sets, vibrant costumes and visually appealing cinematography, this filmed-version of Phantom is hopelessly dull, leaden and uninspired; and, unlike the soaring and luminous chandelier in the opening sequence, regrettably earthbound, and emotionally unsatisfying.Many missteps, and unfortunate miscastings leaves this phantom ""dead-in-the-lair"" and a dismal disappointment. Schumacher would do well to view films by masters, e.g. Cukor, Wyler, Minnelli, etc., should he ever be re-hired to direct another screen musical. (Shame on Weber for recruiting him in the first place.)One star for Rossum who succeeds where Butler fails. Overall, this film pales in comparison to the sensational musical play millions of people will continue to relish and enjoy in theatres across the globe."
4,Wonderful except for 10 minutes,"This was the only movie I've ever gone to that I've contemplated leaving because it was so bad, but it was only bad for ten minutes, the rest was delightful. I'm angry that they killed ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Music of the Night"". Emmy Rossum looks like a reject from the Rocky Horror Picture Show and rides a horse through the bowls of the opera house. She also looks like she got drugged with something during ""Music of the Night"". I will purchase the movie because I can skip these horrible two numbers, which is a shame because these two songs are two of my favorites. The sets and costumes are great, the supporting actors (not the three primary ones) make the movie worth watching. But be warned that these ten minutes are bad!"
1,Toooo Musical,This Sucked for tons of Reasons the phantom is not Suposed to be a sexy young man and they made it like Van Helsing lots of Special Effects like the part where christine tears off the phantom's mask and his hair turns white Come Onnnnn and every conversation turns to a musical song stayyy Awayyy
2,Dissapointing,"I was very dissapointed after seeing this movie. The singing was endless and there were WAY to many close-ups. I was tired of seeing people do opera for the whole freakin' movie. It was very tiring.I was very tired after seeing this. The keep singing that song ""Angel of Music"" over and over! The girl who player Christine was terrible! Some parts I couldn't even understand because of the accents. If you are expecting that this is gonna be like Evita or Jesus Christ Superstar, think again! Don't see this. It's no wonder it closing so soon."
1,Wait for the DVD if you must see it,Very lavish production but totally missed the mark. By the end of the movie you didn't care what happended just so long as it was over.
1,awful,"The new movie is awful, I was SO disapointed.The movie is nothing like the Broaway.I have seen it, and I thought it was just a waste of time.If you love the Broadway ""Phantom of the Opera"" You probably don`t want to see the movie. The only good characters in the whole movie are Madame Giry, Meg, and Raul.On the whole I was just Very disapointed."
5,The New & Hotter Phantom,"I also, as many others, have seen the stage production more than once. At that time, no one could have compared to Michael Crawford, but now that I have seen the movie, I only listen to that soundtrack. Yes, Gerard Butler is not formally trained, but, WOW, his raspy rocky voice comes off so much sexier and manlier it's pathetic. When he's mad or singing with a booming voice, I hold my breath. I, unlike the masses, never got into Sarah Brightman, her voice was too operatic for a rock opera. Yes, I also saw the few mistakes, but they were easy to forgive when one looks at the picture as a whole. It stirred many emotions especially when the music fit the scene perfectly. My cheers to all involved. I wouldn't change a thing! Also, I thought it was a sham that the costumes and makeup were overlooked at Oscar time. I will be buying this DVD on May 3rd!"
5,Seriously Recommended,"Before I saw the movie, I was a bit sceptical of the idea. I don't like operas usally (that's my sister) but after... I was left dumbfounded. I'm not normaly a big musical-on-screen person (unless it's Disney) but it really blew me away with emotion.I would recommend the soundtrack as well, because of the amazing music. The scenes come back to you,the dancing is great, and it's easy for a song to get stuck in your head! The acting is phenomenal, and Emmy Rossen has the most clear, breathtaking voice, especially considering the fact that she was 17 while it was filmed. Gerald Butler is a good Phantom, but his voice is not amazing. He does, however, provide the necessary gruff, myserious nature of the Phantom. Seriously recommended!!!!"
4,Great Film but no Chicago,I saw the film this past weekend for my first time. I have seen the show 14 times and Sarah Brightman in concert also twice. I have to say that I love Emily playing Christine. She is the best thing in the movie. I also liked Patrick Wilson. When Patrick and her sing on top of the theater its great. I think the weakest point initially is the singing of the Phantom. Yes you do get used to him and he sounds great by the end but that initial singing calling her from the mirror after Christine's first triumph is just shocking. He is no Michael Crawford. But is does look great and like I said Emly Rossum is the second best thing to Sarah Brightman. She is just amazing. I liked the movie and will watch it again. Just expect it not to be the soundtrack of the broadway show.
2,It just didn't work for me,"I still remember with a sense of awe seeing ""Phantom of the Opera"" in London in 1992. I'll never forget the way the Phantom appeared through the mirror to Christine and the brilliant staging of their descent into a labyrinth under the opera house.But I really found this movie impossible to watch. The leads are all pretty or handsome and the staging is lavish. But it just didn't ring true. I felt that it was so very obvious that the actors and actresses weren't really singing in the moments I was watching them but were just being dubbed.This surprises me because I did like and watch the movie ""Chicago"" despite having seen and loved the musical. Maybe it's because the movie version had some serious star power while ""Phantom"" has a bunch of unknowns.In the end, I suppose ""to each his or her own,"" but I can't help but think the movie is a pale and most inadequate copy of the musical."
4,What a film,"this is a pretty good movie. It's very musical and outstanding. I thought it would suck, but it was awesome everyone should see it. Andrew Lloyd Webber's musci in the film rocks. The soundtrack is sweet to, you should check it out. this a a pretty good musical."
2,phanton of the opera,"Chicago transferred to the movies as GREAT, WOW, SENSATIONAL. this Broadway show, what happened.outside of the actress who played christine is beautiful but only fairly talented and the rest of this mish mash of what the hell is it... altho stunning photographed. it is boring beyond belief. To take two songs and make a show I don't think so"
3,Phantom of the Opera,"I was not as attentive watching the movie as I was watching the play. It seemed to drag to me, especially the singing. Can'r compare it to the play!"
5,Outstanding Story of Unrequited Love and Manipulation,"Anyone that saw the play will love this DVD Version. It's difficult to really say anything that has not already been said. Forgive me for one subtle critique.The scene where Christine first unmasks the Phantom. The OG fails to demonstrate both the anger and the devastation at the perceived slight that I would have imagined.Have to say that Carlotta was magnificent in her role.And of course, dear Christine was terrific!"
2,Choose better singers,"I love the music and the storyline in Phantom. However, as spectacular as the sets were, Gerard Butler absolutely ruined this for me. I was cringing listening to him sing. I would have thought that Mr Webber would have made a much better choice and scrutinized the vocal performances more than he obviously did. Is Gerard an actuall trained singer or not?If you watch this with the sound off (there goes the beautiful music), at least you'll still have a beautiful visual. What a shame."
2,Overall Disappointing,"Where do I begin? The stage design, costumes, lighting, etc. are fabulous. Gerard Butler as the Phantom is miscast or misdirected, even though I think he gave it his all. He is too handsome and not nearly ugly enough under the mask, and he smiles too much. The Phantom doesn't smile! He needed to be weirder, more sinister, and frightening, with a little perversity thrown in, yet still sexy. My main complaint is the last, and most important scene of the movie - it is all wrong, and I blame the director. The Phantom cries like a wimp, and the kiss scene between him and Christine is terrible. If you are a fan of the play/musical, as I am,than of course you must see the movie, however,it had such potential to be really fabulous with just a few changes, but was such a disappointment."
2,"Beautiful sets, terrible singing","I was very disappointed in the girl that played Christine, her voice was so weak and breathy. Anyone with good vocal training, I suggest plugging your ears when Christine sings. I have to say though, the sets and costumes are very well done, it's worth to go and see it just for that. But, voacaly in this movie, don't expect much."
5,Better than Expected,"Amazing production! I didn't think it could compete with the play, but it was excellently performed and directed!! Gerard Butler, in different form from other motion pictures, was outstanding. All other actors did not disappoint either."
5,Phantom of the Opera 2004,"I am not a big musical fan, but I was hooked a few minutes into the movie. I even showed the movie to my kids 6 and 8 and they loved it. Excellent movie recommend to all who love a great love story."
1,No refund for a returned DVD,"This product was incompatible with my equipment. When I called Amazon for help I was told that the DVD should play in my equipment and was probably a bad DVD (I had purchased two. One for myself and one as a gift.)Amazon replaced the product with exactly the same product. In my next phone call to Amazon, after I had returned the 2 replacement DVD's, I was told tough luck...no help. Even though one DVD was returned unopened I was given no refund...my order was considered to be the order that replaced my original order. Seems I'm out over $40.00 but Amazon is out of one pretty loyal customer who has a fairly good order record over the past years. There are far too many sites where I can order merchandise,get help and be treated fairly.No more Amazon shopping for me."
2,Phantom,"Having seen the show 15 times with both Broadway Casts, and Traveling casts, I must say that the Phantom in the movie had a far worse singing voice than anyone I have ever seen play that role. I was very disappointed"
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing film ... the cinematography was wonderful, the costumes were fantastic. Emmy is beautiful and a wonderful actress, but she's NOT an opera singer. Patrick is pretty to look at; too bad he can't act or sing. Gerard was perfect I think; great actor, just the right 'edge' to his voice to be convincing. The new orchestrations are lush and just right. I was most impressed with Miranda and Minnie, and quickly got over the fact that Minnie's voice was dubbed for the singing; she's a marvelous comedic actress and has been overlooked for far too long."
5,"Great Movie, Great Music","I just saw this movie and I was very impressed. The actors/actresses are great, the costumes are absolutely gorgeous, the playhouse is magnificent, and the music is nothing less than incredible. I just loved this movie from start to finish. However, I do wish that there were a love seen in the movie - it would have been nice to see some passion and it would have made the movie perfect.If you happen to come across some negative reviews by critics, then DO NOT pay attention. These people are always getting everything wrong. Go see the movie for yourself. You will be pleased. I plan to see it a second time at the theaters, and I plan to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD. I also bought the soundtrack and it's great.By the way, I haven't seen the ""play"" yet and I am really hoping that it comes back to California soon so that I can see it. I have heard that the play is incredible."
4,The return of the Phantom,"I was pleased to see that Webber, an experienced musicial playwright was making his hit musicial, Phantom of the Opera, into a movie. I studied the Phantom of the Opera a couple years back. I read a play, saw a cartoon, and watched the silent movie and musicial from the 70's. It was really interesting.The time that the movie came to my town, I was so excited. It was getting close to my birthday and I was so ecstatic to go see the movie, as I was promised. On my birthday, turns out, the movie wasn't playing anymore. So, I never got to see it until now. I am proud to say that it is a great movie, but the musicial is better, I have heard.I give this 4 stars. Why not 5 you ask? Because the book is always better! The book, written by Gaston Leroux, is a great buy. I suggest you check the book out if you like this, or anything connected to Phantom."
4,As good as the play!,"First of all, the production of the film is as good as the play itself! Now, having the chance to see it in Blu-ray gives you the opportunity to enjoy this wonderful experience almost in a live-like stage."
4,Great,This film is great. I love the music from Phantom and this movie is a fun version of the play. Even with it's weaknesses (sound editing is pretty bad and the Phantom's voice isn't perfect) it is a good rendition of the classic musical.
5,phantom of the opera,The seller shipped the merchandise promply and it arrived in good condition. This is my first time using Amazon and I was very impressed.
3,Decent show,"I would have given this show 4 stars if it wasn't for the creepy, fake cop. I feel they spent way too much time on him. This was a rather strange look at suicide attempts, putting a comedic spin on it while they worked in a group to support one another. At the same time, there were some touching moments that made the show worth watching. It was obvious that the show wasn't meant to end at the 10th episode. Too bad they couldn't have given some closure to the story."
2,WOW....at first,"wanted to braid my hair to protect it from the summer sun and maintain my ""Fro"".....this does it at a super bargain price. If you used a lotion moisturizer, you will get ringlet like curls, it you pick it, brush the hair, it is a ""Fro""....dyed it to match mine exactly and it maintained it's integrity...be careful, dying hair for weaving, is not for neophytes(LOL)...had previously bought some hair that I did not like as much at a local vendor that was 4x as much... not exactly what I wanted......love this, it looks just like my hair......THEN I WASHED IT:It was awful....I even separated it so that I could handle it and stop any tangling...well it did not happen....at this point it is a ""Fro"", but it is very difficult to handle. Spent most of the day untangling and loosing massive amounts of the hair...make sure you buy more than you need and apply it, because when it comes time to wash it, you will loose half of it in tangles and/or just plain coming off the weft"
5,Fast Talking McQueen,"I received the order in record time and in excellet condition. Saved time from trying to find it in a store loacally, and arrived right at my door step.Really cool item, my son loves it."
3,It was a lot of fun when it worked,"As others have noted, when we received this car, we all, not just my 5 yo, had a lot of fun playing with it. The phrases are fun and varied, it was very easy to use, and there were plenty of options to program in to try an maneuver it around chairs. Indeed, it even worked on the carpets.However, as my son usually prefers to interact and push things around rather than just watch them, at one point he manually pushed the car a short distance. Now, only the phrases will work, it just clicks as though the gears are stripped.So, a great toy, buy it if you wish, but be aware of this possible issue."
2,A little odd...but maybe thats what they were going for,This was an interesting show - I won't go out of my way to see it but for free...it was ok. The side-kick drag queens were annoying but Elvira still looks good... when covered in pancake makeup.
4,Not a bad product,The laser works really well and the kit has everything you need to mount it on a variety of weapons and in different configurations. At night the laser is actually visible up 2 kilometers away. The only problem I had with it is that the mounts themselves aren't very durable. The screws break easily.
1,Average,I felt like I was reading a list of lame conversations I didn't really enjoy the play except for the last 3 pages which were interesting if you read the previous 68.
2,Returning,I am returning this product as it is too light weight. The hinge broke and lever holding it on fell off. I clearly need a heavier model.
4,Good Product,"The Lund Tri-Fold is a good value. Easy on (5 minute installation), easy off. Sturdy, well designed. Works well with a lockable tailgate for secuirty. Highly recommended."
5,Tri-fold Tonneau Cover - Easy install and easy to use,"Cover was easy to install, took about 20 min in the dark. I have since removed and re-installed several times and it takes maybe 2 minutes to do now. Most of that time is walking back and forth around the truck. It looks good and keeps my equipment dry. It's not water tight but keeps about 99% of rain/moisture out. Only time I've seen water get in there is during a heavy downpour while on the interstate and the amount was tiny. I have it on a HD truck so the mileage gain was minimal, maybe 0.5 mpg on the highway (truck weighs 5,800 lbs)"
4,Another DUPLICATE,"There was a terrible familiarity with this about three minutes in: haven't I seen this before? Well, I had. It is a repeat from Volume 2, British Rail Journeys, which I already own. Okay, so I am 75 and am permitted to be a bit forgetful, I guess. Anyway, this is a trip from Cambridge to Sheringham in the Southeast of England, shot in the '90s and quite scenic. Very worthwhile although, if you bought Volume 2, you would get two segments of this excellent series for what you are paying for just this one. Either way it is a worthwhile investment."
1,WMV DRM License Server Down,"The trailers and other non-DRM protected media look great! I was stoked to watch this, but then playback failed as it tried to contact 1.licenseserver.com to verify the license. This server is apparently no longer up and running. My conclusion is that WMV with DRM sucks as I spent my Friday night fighting this rather than watching a flick I paid for."
3,To the Limit,"Was wanting a video for rock climbing, this was a video about the human body.glad the price was very cheap. payed for 3 day shipping but 10 days to get."
3,worthwhile intro,"This book is a good introduction to the subject of sexual fantasy, but I'd say it serves more as inspiration than as more explicit ""how-to"" for anyone interested in more developed fantasy scenarios.Some of the ""fantasies"" aren't very risque (entries of getting wet with water; ""elegant sex"" e.g. dressing up to go out and having sex afterwards) but are good reminders of nice things to do with your partner.The photos are generally tasteful but in some points verge on cheesy or like the protagonists don't *really* know what they are doing (especially in the entry on ""tantric sex"" where the couple in the photo don't look like they've ever held their hands in a mudra before).This is a nice, quick read to refresh or inspire your own imagination, or to give to a partner as a cute and unexpected gift."
1,Caution - not the Cirrus you may be thinking of,"I was looking for the guys on the Moonshine label... Back On A Mission, etc. I came across 2 more albums here I hadn't seen in the store before, and picked them both up. Turns out this one is a completely different band. Dissappointed tha my server can't play the Real files or I would have known... So - this might be a good album, I don't know - some kind of folk music type of a thing. There'd be a better description from someone who gave it more than a minute, but not me. Don't make the same mistake!"
2,Vague,"I was not happy with all the items marked NA(not available), RI(recent issue), etc. The book, in my opinion, is not up to date & has very little value to someone who wants to price out their collection"
2,disappointing information,"this was not an up to date guide, which was a dissapointed. the plate collectors dont have many resources and to have a product out there with information that is several years back and it is not disclosed is a rip off. Buyer beware make sure you know what you are getting and if it does not say new or updated within the same year, dont buy it."
2,It's kind of dirty,"It leaves a substance on the screen that can be removed when it's dry, and then it looks finally clean, but it's kind of annoying to have to clean the screen twice when you just want to do it fast"
3,An Extremely Anthropological Disection Of The Male Psyche,"I've read a number of books dealing with this genre, but this was (by far) the most dry. It is extremely clinical, and reads more like a doctoral dissertation than a book. That's not to say that there weren't some interesting points made in the book, but you REALLY had to dig through the anthro jargon.Franks cites other source a lot -- more than any other book I've read. Nearly every paragrah refers to an exterior source. I found this a little distracting.Overall, I'm not sorry I read the book, but be prepared -- it does not wisk you along -- you really have to fight to glean Frank's points."
4,"the other dynamic, without which there is no club....the guy","Until now there have been many many tales written by erotic dancers and few to none about the guys who frequent the thousands of establishments on a regular basis. Why indeed do we keep showing up? Frank peels away some of the layers, giving us thoughtful insite.Please consider reading yet another book, written by a guy with assistance from the dancers in his life. ENVELOPED BY VENUS, also featured here on Amazon, may add depth to your understanding and enjoyment of the state of mind best described as, enraptured and ENVELOPED."
2,Of course this is clinical!,"K.F. did write her dissertation on the topic of this book. This book is more for anthropology/sociology students than for the general public. I had to read it for a class and had no escape from it. I would have gladly stopped after the first chapter since the rest of the book recycled the same topics and ideas anyway.After reading several ethnographies, with all their technical terms and dissections, well, this one was way too tedious to enjoy compared to the rest. Seems like Frank really wanted to prove she was a stripper just for the research and overcompensated with complicated language and anthropological theories instead of applying common sense.Good for anthropology students who want to make an interesting topic boring as hell."
5,Provides real knowledge,"Dr. Surina Ann Jordan's book Got Cancer? Congratulations! Now You Can Start Living is a comprehensive way in which to look at cancer from a holistic perspective. Without causing alarm,Got Cancer outlines how cancer affects the whole body and also the ways in which we can take not only preventative measures, but also heal some of the damage done to our bodies. This book truly serves as an interactive, non-invasive platform for conversation, that doesn't criticize, but suggests the best way to wellness for mind, body, and spirit. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone suffering cancer, or just simply wants to live well. I even gave the book to my aunt, who is fighting breast cancer."
2,Dempsey - Sunrise Sunset,"Bizarro alt-folk-electronic-rock from Geoff McIntyre. What else can you make of the police siren laden homage to Ol' Dirty Bastard on ""ODB on the Run""? Even with Mr. Four Tet, Kieran Hebden, on production duties, the first half of _Sunrise Sunset_ doesn't quite gel. Individual moments have their spark, like the sparse funk of ""Hippy Dream"" or the dreamy twang of ""Sweet Fanny Adams,"" but they don't necessarily add up to coherence. ""What You Goin' On About"" integrates the rhythm and merges with the the bluegrass guitar better. When The Underdog takes over the production duties, the tracks become much more clean, but this can sometimes be a downside: the silliness of ""Buzz"" becomes that much more apparent. The langourous slide of ""Down the Track"" carries some country-western sadness, and the simple cello of ""Blue Star"" holds the weight of the world, but as a whole, though, _Sunrise Sunset_ seems too in love with its own eclecticism to make a strong musical statement."
5,Excellent Read,"As a resident of Western North Carolina and a former teacher, I can identify with these characters. Some of the descriptions are so clear that I pictured them happening in locations near to my home. The characters are realistic and funny and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book."
5,soulsearching,"I found this book very informative, especially the cases pertaining to soulmates and soulgroups. I have been attempting to access my past lives and I am glad that I have not experienced anything detrimental to my health. The cases of regression going wrong.... well as they say fools rush in. I will now take precautions before any more attempts. Thank you Ms Judy Hall"
4,six notch road,"This book has a unique plot line and is a good read even for those who do not like the Western genru. I have checked the factual setting and find that the writer does a fine job of being historically accurate. I would recommend this book to all who love Western fiction and those who simply enjoy a good, well told story. Malcolm"
4,Very good DVD,"I got the see the last part of this on PBS, and wanted to see the first part of the show. It's really very good, and gives one a better perspective on life in places other than the majority Christian U.S.. I have always had a problem with the ""It's my God Given Right to destroy Nature"", and it's good to see a culture that has a differ point of view, and a different approach to dealing with modern problems.. It's a must see if you have an open mind.."
5,Importancia de la Invocación,"Este Maravilloso libro nos trae a la memoria, la importancia de la Invocación del Bien.La Invocación del bien de parte del hombre es su instrumento básico para atraer la Gloria del Cielo a la Tierra.Es imperativo que nos purifiquemos para asegurar que la invocación sea constructiva.Invocamos todo aquello sobre lo cual fijamos nuestra atención.Los Maestros Ascendidos especialmente el Maestro Saint Germain y el Arcángel Zadkielestán encargados de la enseñanza de este arte a la humanidad para traer la Edad Dorada a la Tierra."
1,Horrible,"One of the worst books I've ever (tried to) read. Had to skip to the end, and even then it wasn't worth the time commitment."
1,Unbelievably bad,"Whitley Strieber has written some very intelligent, scary, thought-provoking stuff -- and this ain't it. It tries to be, by turns, sexy, scary, and really really gross, and fails miserably on all counts (well, it does manage to be pretty gross). There are no believable characters, the horror is too over-the-top and cartoonish to be scary, and the plot is beyond stupid."
1,Eeech!,"This novel is worse than the worst I read as a tad in Amazing Stories back in the 40's! No plot, paper (not even cardboard) characters,and impossible dialogue. I finished it just for the challange.Wolf in the Adirondacks."
1,The very worst of the worst,"This is literally the worst book I have ever read. I read it a number of years ago, but it was so bad that I remember it even to this day. Was the author on drugs when he wrote this book? I don't know for sure, but the writing itself is pretty good evidence of it. After the amazing novel ""The Wolfen"" this was a pretty big let down."
4,Useful for small spaces,We received the wicker set today and are very pleased with the quality of the two chairs and table. No assembly required and looks very modern - dark grey colour.Goes very nicely on our balcony in our 4th floor flat
4,"Beautiful set, flawed packaging","This set is a lovely quality, is comfortable and looks very nice. I don't know why the color is listed as dark gray, I would disagree and call it dark brown. It is just as pictured on the website. However, although heavily packaged with shrink wrap, foam sheeting, and cardboard spacers, the metal on the pieces rubbed against each other resulting in a damaged enamel finish on the table top and one of the chair legs. It is scraped right down to the metal. Now I am left to decide whether I should pack it all back up and return it and risk getting the same damage on the next set (which I can expect will be packaged the same way), or deal with the possibility of rust spots down the line. A solid sheet of cardboard separating each piece in the set would, I believe, have prevented this damage. If I send it back, I will update to say whether the replacement had the same problem."
3,arrived damaged twice!,"We returned damaged set, received 2nd set and it was damaged in just the same place - scrapes on both sides of the table exactly across from each other. The second time the damage was wrapped and on the inside of the package.It was either re-packed AFTER damaged & returned or the damage occured during manufacturing we guess. We gave up as re-packing and taking it back to town again is too difficult. I sanded & used touch up paint but for over $220 it is NOT GOOD to have to do this! We did keep it due to lightness, easy to fold and store, pretty good looking & chairs are quite comfy."
4,Cute and modern,"I just unpacked my bistro set and had two immediate impressions. I really like the look of the table and chairs! I was slightly disappointed that the wicker top does not extend all the way to the border of the table. Food will definitely end up falling in. Otherwise, I hope that it lasts a long time!"
1,Narration on sound recording almost as bad as the writing.,"I think if I had read this book instead of listening to it, the children would not as come off as petulant little brats. The narrator was over the top, making Sara so very saintly and Mack as nasty as Snidely Whiplash. The only interesting characters were the Corcorans. The plot was flimsy and as many reviewers pointed out there were many holes and unanswered questions. For instance: Do not the authors know that there are more than one airports in New York? So if one is shut down for security reasons, Sara and Ruben could have flown out of another one, or flown out of DC?To those who did not finish the book, you did not miss much. The last part was mostly filler consisting of preaching. It was like they had to meet their word limit and just didn't want to make the effort to wrap up loose ends, like what happened to Mack.This is the first Judith Michael book I've read and I don't think I'll take a chance on another one."
1,Very bad writing - avoid like the plague,"This is the first Judith Michael book I've ever read and I hated it. I was lucky in that I picked it up for 50 cents at a used bookshop, but sorry I invested time reading it. The characters are universally dislikeable, even the kids and the disabled mother. The 'bad guy' in it wasn't much more obnoxious than anyone else in the story. They are all whiny and needy without exception. The ending petered out without tying much of anything up. It felt like it was written by someone who is good at writing steamy, bodice ripping romances but wanted to be taken seriously as a good writer.Don't waste your time."
1,The Real Mother,"I sure wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this book in hardcover. I totally agree with other reviews - this has to be the worst book they have written. I am an avid reader but this one kept putting me to sleep! Like so many others, I purchased because of their previous good books but this is the bottom of the barrel."
1,Not Good,"This is the first and probably the last book I will read by Judith Michael. My mother-in-law recommended it and I am not sure why. Anyway, after struggling through 100 or so pages, I flipped to the end and wasn't all surprised that I didn't miss a thing by skipping 75% of it. Not good at all."
2,To Cure Your Insomnia......Read This,"Was this really written by Judith and Michael? If I didn't know better, a fledgling ghost writer dreamed it up. It was too juvenile beyond words. I kept falling asleep but as I never want to leave a book half finished, I crept slowly through. Oh please, don't do this to me again."
1,don't bother,"You could count on a well written book from Judith Michael. This one missed by a mile.Had a very hard time finishing this. Characters were shallow making their actions unbelievable. Time lines were loose (sorry you can't drive from NY to Chicago overnight). How did this family make ends meet with a mom in a nursing home, No Dad (but not dead - so no life insurance $$) and the fine tastes in decor and food and housing....The whole book came off shallow."
2,Not their best...,"While this is perhaps, not as bad as their last offering, A Certain Smile, I have to agree with the others... this book was quite dissapointing. We weren't given any history on the characters, the whole story was just so undeveloped. I think I'll settle for digging up their previous books and re-reading them- now those were great stories."
1,Dreadful!,"I've been a Judith Michael fan since the beginning, but this latest novel seems to have been ghost-written by someone totally unfamiliar with the authors' previous work. It was morally preachy, filled with clichés, repetitive and lacked depth. Just dreadful!"
1,THEIR WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!,"I have never written a review before. I am an avid reader and have read Judith Michaels books for years. This book is so bad I feel compelled to let other people know. I was so dissapointed in this book that I couldn't even finish it. The language was so foul. It is written so poorly and in such an immature fashion. This book has no depth. This book is offensive and a waste of time. It reads like they had to get a book out really fast to make a house payment or pay off some bills. I am so upset that I spent money on the hardcover version that I am going to try and find their website and let them know how offensive this book is. They have written such great stuff in the past and I was so happy when I saw a new book by them. I feel angry that they wrote such trash and had the nerve to actually put it in the book stores. No matter what you do, don't buy this book. It would be a waste of your hard earned money. I wish someone had warned me.Thanks for listening."
2,My Least Favorite Judith Michael book,"I finished the book because I wanted to see how everything shook out in the end, but I skimmed large swaths of pages. As other reviewers have written, there were too many unanswered questions and too many plot points that just didn't make enough sense. And I was irritated by the irritating way Sara's irritable brother Mack spoke. (Yes, I'm parodying it in the previous sentence.) No one talks that way! And in this day and age, given its slang meaning, who would name a character ""Pussy"" in a work of mainstream fiction?"
2,Don't pay money for this book,"I have collected all of Judith Michael's books over the years and this one is the worst I have ever read. I was warned by a review in Amazon to try it first thru the library. My checkbook thanks whoever wrote that review. I checked it out and found myself actually skipping pages to jump to the next page of actual dialog. I am not a prude, but the language that was used by 13-20 year old kids was shocking. The story line got lost somewhere and young Doug only ""shouted"" everything, never just talked. It was absolutely the most disappointing book I have been exposed to in a long time. Will put them on the ""skip"" list in the future."
1,I Just Couldn't Do it!!!!!,"I struggled to page 147 of this book and finally gave up. I hate to toss away a book without giving it a chance...but this was just not good. Lack of character profiles, lack of good storyline and no excitement made for very hard reading!"
4,Good drying rack,Two drying racks have recently broken on me and this is my third one. I think this one is going to hold up better because of how the top part comes together when it unfolds. I've had it a few weeks and so far so good. I will update this post if it ever breaks.
4,Great Product,We are using the clothes dryer as our electric dryer broke down. It works well as we put it in front of our fireplace and keep a fan running on the side. All the clothes are dry in about 3 hours. Saving a lot on our electric bill too.
5,A Lifesaver,"I am very happy with this metal clothing dryer. It's so much sturdier and easier to set up than the WOOD drying racks I've had in the past. It holds quite a bit of clothing too! The white color that I received looks much nicer than the numerous silver racks I've seen for sale. This rack is great quality, folds up easily to fit in small areas and it's definitely worth the price!"
4,Most amazing book ever,This book is the most great one I have ever read I.it is truly heartfelt .it is amazing!I love it!
4,not so bad... come on guys...,"I couldn't help but smile while reading this book. I found it to be a fresh outlook on Bjork. Instead of hearing someone who knew everything, we see Bjork through the eyes of someone who started out knowing nothing about her. It's a first hand evolution of the bjork fan. I find it to be almost a representation of the crossing over into that place where it is hard to return. Once I became a fan, I was a fan for life, and I admire this author for sharing this raw, intimate experience she had. I enjoyed the book, and I feel it only brought me closer to Bjork's music. I think every Bjork fan could relate to this book."
1,Double yaaaaaaaawn,"While I must admire the author for trying to write a book about Bjork, I began to wonder if she really was, or was just trying to write about her social view towards God knows what. I mean I know it's trendy and all but Labeling this and that conservative and calling former mayor Rudy Guliani an ---hole was not only in bad taste but has nothing to do with the book. If she wants express her liberal ideology kaka she needs not look far, just don't put it in a biography about Bjork, who is quite the fox I might add."
3,A Decent Outing,"I enjoyed this CD. It's not as good as ATDI's Relationship of Command, not that it's fair to compare the two, but it isn't. There are some very good songs on here ""Cut Your Ribbon"", ""Mye"", and especially ""Endodyne Harmonic"". But overall I found the songs not as interesting as ROC. For the most part they are not as complex are missing some of the quirkiness that made ATDI so unique. I think the singing is pretty good though(Jim Ward reminds me a lot of Walter from Quicksand/Rival Schools). But whatever...if you like that hardcore sound that ATDI produced you will like what Sparta is offering here. A good CD, just not great."
2,i bet they asked to take the ATDI name,"I think unfortunately for Sparta fans this is going to be the best this band has to offer. These guys rip off their old band so much I don't know if there is anything left to tear at. As time goes on they are going to forget their lessons from professors Bixler and Rodriguez and will make albums that sound a lot like this. Unfortunately if I wanted this sound, I'd put on an ATDI album.This album is for fans of the warped tour, and for people who drink light beer. It doesn't take much effort to listen to this and they aren't surprising you with anything new."
4,Getting past the drive in,"Ok, so there are alot of expections that people may have when first listening to this record. For one we all know the members history and what have you, but I think as soon as the first track opens up all expections are lived up to. For me at least. Having loved ATDI and still do. I still listen to Vaya all the time. If your looking for ATDI part two this is not it. If your looking for honest to God Rock N Roll, this is it. If your also looking for another Rock N Roll band, check out the band Mid-Day Anonymous, from New Jersey. Those guys are amazing. Pure Rock power, with a take no prisoners approach."
4,good cd,"i anonymously recommend this album. it has a nice range of grittier and slower stuff but always with melody and emotion behind it, not phony, senseless [useless stuff]."
4,A strong Comeback,At the Drive-In is by far one of my favorite bands. When they broke up I didn't know how to fill the void. This cd is definitely not AtDI due to the fact that Cedric is missing but in many ways it is even better... They have matured a lot and prove it on this album. They are able to make incredible music without having to use fury and volume to get the message across. Anyone who loved AtDI will be pleasantly surprised by this tasty morsel.
2,This is the rock album I'm telling you about!,"Hello, today it would bring my pleasure to review to you the rock album ""Wiretap Scars"" by the rock band of ""The Sparta"". This band is made from some ""At The Drive In"" Apparently it is made from the lame parts, because the good parts are now in the rock band called ""The Mars Volta"" and they rock. But these guys are the lame parts. There are a couple of good songs on here, but you can always hear them on the MTV. If you like lame want to be punk rock like ""Blink 182"" then you will probably be lame enough to like this too. If you like music that is new and fresh and on the edge that cuts, get ""The Mars Volta"" They have what it takes. Thank You!"
4,wiretap scars,"sparta feature 2 former members of at the drive in, one of the more powerful post-hardcore bands, well, ever.sparta have nothing to do with at the drive in, though. this release is solid enough to stand on its own (i was not aware that sparta featured members of ATDI until several months after i first heard them).wiretap scars is powerful and relevant, and its simply one of the best rock guitar albums our generation is likely to see. pay no mind to any ATDI comparisons you may hear. sparta is a completely new band.this is an album that i will never forget, and i predict that it will have the staying power of a classic. i recommend this to every hard rock fan in the world. dont let this one pass you by."
3,It should have been better,"Wire Tap Scars has a somewhat over produced sound, i.e., there are soft twists of the vocals (inflections), which can be annoying at times (if your are an ATDI fan). I am saying it could be better because I have heard better versions via P2P (before the release of Wire Tap Scars). In fact these better versions, which sound more like ATDI, are the reasons I bought the CD. I was very disappointed to find the songs were different. I have not heard it yet but I think Austere would sound better (I think these are the songs I originally heard from P2P). If you are an at the drive-in fan be sure to check out Mars Volta."
2,boring,"I was very disappointed when I first heard Sparta and this cd doesn't change my views at all. At the Drive-In was innovative and had tons of energy packed into their music. Unfortunately, Sparta has neither. The guitar work is bland, and the singing sounds like a very sub-par copy of Cedric. After listening to this it's easy to see who were the main creative forces in At the Drive-In: Cedric and Omar. That being said, if you liked ATDI, then you'd probably enjoy the Mars Volta a lot more than this cd."
3,doesn't deliver on the promise of the ep,"the austere ep made it clear that Sparta was a great emo band that could deliver emo's Ok Computer(it could have came out after this lp though I'm not sure), particularly with the brilliant Cataract. Wiretap Scars isn't exactly the Ok Computer that's going to push emo forward but it is one of the best emo/post-hardcore/indie-rock/whatever albums in a while. Cataract is on this album and other highlights include Cut Your Ribbon, Mye, and Collapse. The whole album is strong, but unfortunately after a while it starts to run together.Musically they sound like a poppier Jawbox and ATDI and some of their rythms sound like early Promise Ring. If you like those bands you'll probably like this."
3,3.5 Good job and stuff,"Because when this came out, i hadn't banished radio from my life, and still listened to linkin park and P.O.D, I figured they were a new band. Then i heard of At the drive-in from this. Then i heard of the mars volta from them. But anyway, who cares-if you do you shouldn't. I'm gonna get into all 3 bands. Anyway-this album is pretty. Also it's pretty darn good. They use classic mainstream punk (in a good way) and add electronics and piano to create a sound sort of but not quite similar to Cave-in's latest record, Antenna. (which you should also pick up) Good band, i don't care about what other band they were in or which new band is better, them or mars volta,I just like the album. Tadaaaaa blahblahblah"
2,not that good,"I really dont understand why so many people like this album. I agree with everyone that Sparta doesn't sound like ATDI and the Mars Volta likewise. But I don't know, this CD was just very dissappointing, the lyrics weren't very artistic/creative/good, the vocals (stink), the guitars arn't even that imaginative (they're just lame, cheesy). The main thing that tees me off on this album is that it seems like it tries too hard to sound like most of the popular stuff thats playing on alternative/mainstream radio (im not really a fan of the mainstream stuff in music). The CD has some decent songs like ""Cut your ribbon,""Mye,"" and ""Echodyne Harmonic,"" but thats pretty much it (keep in mind theyre not great songs, but decent ones). Anyways i recommend the Mars Volta's Tremulant EP instead of this (thing). When the Mars Volta's De-Loused in the Comatorium comes out on June 24th, this Wiretap Scars LP will soon be forgotten."
2,Middling,"When listening to this CD and the Mars Volta's De-Loused In The Comatorium, it's very easy to see where all the talent in ATDI ended up. And it's not in Sparta. This album is the very definition of safe, derivative and mediocre. Sparta can't decide what they are and at various times try to come off like an extension of ATDI, emo-core screamers a la Thrice, or, when I saw them at Coachella, clumsy political satirists. The best way for me to describe Sparta is through this analogy: If ATDI is Coca Cola Classic, then Sparta is Pepsi One and The Mars Volta is Jolt Cola."
3,Not What You Might Expect,"In general, like most of the reviewers on this page, I'm a huge ATDI fan. With that said, I came into listening this album with the expectations of a phoenix rising from the ashes of ATDI, unfortunately it came up shorter than that, way short. Compared with Relationship Command and other previous ATDI albums, this album just sounds like it's too mainstream style alterna-rock. The songs form the typical verse, prechorus, chorus, repeat styles, with the exception of a few and there is nothing really noticeable or great about this album. In my opinion, if you've expected more, I highly recommend the new Mars Volta album (i'm blown away by it)."
1,Worst CD I Own,"This is by far the most boring album I own...If the opening track ""Cut Your Ribbon"" is the heaviest they can get then there is no impressing me."
4,damn good!,"Ok, I just got this CD, and it's just simply amazing! Honestly, I wasn't too familiar w/ ATDI, and what I did hear I didn't get into. But I saw Sparta open for Weezer and I was captured by the sound. The lead's voice is loud and raw. But it's also high-pitched, which is a nice change from some of the lower, gruffy-sounding leads of some bands [] you hear on the radio. When he screams the lyrics, he doesn't sound as angry as he may be trying to come across. Instead, it's almost soothing and has a good amount of harmony with it. I've listened to the CD just a few times now, and the lyrics don't seem the kind one can easily relate to. However, they're deliberately intelligent (and not random, as they first sound). Guitars and drums are heavy, and just make this band and this CD a winner. Song #4 (""Collapse"") will just tug at your heart strings! I don't care if 0 out of 100 people find this review helpful, this CD's kickin' and just buy the damn thing! DO IT!"
3,It's Almost Good Enough,"While I wouldn't call myself much of an At The Drive In fan there were some tracks that you couldn't help but admit were great, sadly I never got into much of the rest. And when the band split it seems most people took a side and announced that the other sucked.Personally I enjoy both bands, but I would compare Sparta more closely to ATDI than I would The Mars Volta. If I had to pick between the two I would take TMV, but much like their predecessor you can't deny that Sparta has some hits."
2,Like ATDI Without the Punch,"I was super disappointed to see the At the Drive In broke up, especially because I had tickets to see them in concert two weeks later. So when I saw that Sparta rose from the ashes, I was eager to hear what would materialize.Again, disappointment. This band sounds like ATDI if you take out all the piss and vinegar that made them rock so hard to begin with. The raw energy and intensity is gone here, and what is left is music that sounds uninspired and dry. There are a few good tracks here, but for the most part the album is just lacking punch. The version of ""Mye"" here I had originally heard on the Austere EP, and I liked it a bunch. But on this album the chorus is changed, and again, it lacks feeling after the change.Mars Volta, Sparta, neither one is At The Drive In quality, and it's sad because I really miss that band a ton."
2,Dont waste your time,"I found this book to be very dissapointing. The whole premise of the story is preposterous, many of the characters are highly annoying, and the ending is weird and disgusting. The first 100 or so pages are OK, but after that the story goes off the deep end and really bogs down, and it's hard making it all the way to the end."
2,Very strange book with no clear meaning,"If an alien sodomizing and torturing a priest is supposed to be thought-provking moral exploration of God's existence, then this is the book for you."
3,A remarkably unique approach for a sci-fi book,"I purchased this book due to another reader's enthusiasm for it. If you, the reader, expect another sci-fi novel with lots of military action---forget it!! What you will find are remarkably well developed characters who may (or may not) act as you think they should under the circumstances given them. if you can accept the premise of members of a Jesuit order undertaking space exploration in the hopes of extending the membership of the Christian community to ""others"" as well as explore what awaits them after contact, you may find this book to your liking. I gave it a 3 because it is like straddling a bar--which way do you fall? Do I regret buying it? no! Would I want to read another similar to it? no! SO, you decide!"
1,A Disappointment,"At the beginning I enjoyed this book. The Sparrow is a Jesuit Sci-Fi novel and this combination is interesting. The nosedive begins when the characters easily manage to secure a live-a-board astroid (Jesuit financed) and then travel to a planet light years away. At this point, Russell asks us to believe Fate brought these friends together for this mission. This is a difficult state to reach with her heavy handed writing style. Still, I stuck with The Sparrow hoping its contrived elements were leading up to some profound religious or moral idea. Unfortunately, the ending crumbled away. I found myself reading a 21st Century author's version of the story of Lot. A version long on the misery, and very brief on the implications."
5,A Memorable Book,"It has been years since I listened to this book on audio, but since I just bought Ms. Russell's latest book I wanted to take the time to recommend this one.It is a story that combines space travel (science fiction) and Jesuits, a highly unlikely, but effective combination. In this future world the Jesuits send priests to another planet with interesting consequences.The style of the book is unusual in that the story is told from two points in time that gradually converge at the end. Like I said its been years so I can't go into detail, but if you like science fiction with a moral dimension this is the book for you."
4,"Fascinating premise, unforgettable characters","It took me a while to get into this book because of the large number of foreign names and the dual storylines, but once I came to know the characters whose lives were changed by the discovery of a sentient radio transmission from Alpha Centauri, I absolutely couldn't put it down. I was absorbed by premise of this story of First Contact and the inadvertent mistakes even the well-meaning make, perhaps inevitably. But it was the humanity of the brave band of travelers that truly drew me in and held me.Highly recommended for those who enjoy intelligent science fiction."
3,Too much religion maybe,This book was recommended and it was OK. Parts I found very enjoyable but: the build-up to the finale was a little slow; the friendship of the travellers a little artificial; and the religious stuff a tad heavy. To me the best part was the way in which the author built the convincing world of Rakhat with all its surprises (positive and negative) for the visitors from Earth.
2,"Tedious, unenlightening","Others have detailed far better than I what is wrong with this book, from the unoriginal idea to the unending exposition of pseudo-scientific data. I'll just say I found it tedious and uninteresting. The frequent hints of dreadful events to be revealed later became more and more annoying, as they coyly tried to keep the reader's interest up. I finally skipped ahead to the dreadful events just so I could be done with the book--to find more stereotyped plot. I'm glad I got it from the library, rather than shelling out money for it."
3,100 Words or Less,"There are many things to like about Russell's novel.It's a realistic look at space exploration. It's filled with clever ideas behind alien civilization. The way it builds suspense throughout the first half of the novel is really good.However, the key words ""first half of the novel"" does not bode well. That's because the deeper I got, the more the plot and characters lost their edge.Oh, it's a good novel. Well written, well thought out. It has some great moments. But a few missteps here and there unfortunately change a great novel into something that is merely good."
3,ience Fiction plus theology.,"If one enjoys Science fiction I am sure they would love this book. I do not - but I waded through some very far fetched imagery to atempt to finish it - only because I am in a book club that chose to read and discuss it. The parts that dealt with theology were quite interesting but I would caution anyone who does not like SciFi not to attempt to read it.I just could'nt accept people on another planet with animal like twitching ears, long tails and hair all over their bodies."
4,Refreshing and well written speculation with an obvious plot,"Take the last section of Well's ""The Time Machine"", stir in some refreshingly intelligent philosophical/theological speculation and add a twist of mystery.While not ultimately successful as a novel, ""Sparrow"" suffers from a derivative plot line, the attempt itself coupled with some fine writing and thought provoking ideas make this a worthy read."
5,Must-read,"This book is truly a must-read, even if you don't consider yourself a fan of sci-fi. The character development and creation of an alien species and society is brilliant. I recommend it frequently and have given away many copies of this book and also ""A Thread of Grace""."
3,"An interesting novel, if you can swallow the premise.","The characters are appealing and mostly very real, but the story is about an incredibly amateurish near-future mission to Alpha Centauri. To hard SF fans, most of the mission's mistakes will seem frustratingly stupid rather than profound or inevitable. If you can read it as a sort of `science fairy tale', though, this is a gripping book with some substantial themes."
3,So promising yet somehow just falls short,"I wanted to love this book...The concept,the story,were perfect a first encounter with other life forms wrapped up in the form of a Jesuit mission.And yet so much time was taken up explaining the technical details of the science required to journey to this new world that the wonderful part of the story..the meeting of the two races,their similarities and differences that you feel as if your slightly shortchanged..Just as your getting involved in that aspect of the story the book is finishing.If the author had developed this story more I think this book would have remained a bestseller for many years to come..all the elements were there...religion,science and a good mystery story.Definitly worth reading..but your left with so many unanswered questions ."
1,Nerdy anthropologist tries her hand at novel writing,"This was one of the most unappealing and just plain boring books I've read in a while. Toward the end I was rushing to just finish it so that I missed what happened to Jimmy and Sofia and then realized that I didn't even care. The characters were so one-dimensional and predictable that I couldn't muster any feeling for them whatsoever. And the trite, pedantic nature of her prose was completely unappealing. I'm sure Ms. Russell is a highly intelligent woman. She should use her intelligence in science, not creative writing."
2,Spurious Sparrow,"If it were not for Mary Doria Russell's writing, I most likely would not have finished this book. A provocative premise, but highly unlikely, thus it becomes fantasy/science fiction.While one of the Jesuits' most notable missions is the evangelization of those who have not yet heard the Gospel, the journey to the so-called planet of ""Rakhat"" hardly qualifies since the Jesuits, as a mendicant order basically rely on donations and alms for financial support. The contemplative mystical element present within the Order might support such a fantastical mission, but the realistic boundaries defy such pursuit.Some might argue that I am missing the point: this is fantasy/science fiction. Unfortunately, my highly memorable knowledge of the Jesuits prevents me from accepting the egregious fallacy of ""The Sparrow."""
2,A boring view of humanity and theology.,"I was disappointed to find that The Sparrow is populated by characters that are shallow, stereotypical, and boring. Complex characters are needed to flesh out the themes that Ms. Russell has chosen for her novel.It's probably not a good or fair comparison, but I kept thinking about Hyperion by Dan Simmons. Many of his characters are flat as well, but he was able to infuse his novel with an overall love of humanity, with it's foibles and flaws, that I didn't find in The Sparrow. Without that deep and enduring love, you can't really have tragedy.I'm glad I took this one out of the library, rather than buying a copy."
2,"Slow, Slow and wordy.","A very slow read, with very little payoff if you fight your way to the end. Less Science Fiction than a character study of a group of people and their inter-personal relations (particularly the Jesuit priest), and for all the wordieness, the charachters are not that intresting. The flashback style drove me crazy, because it didn't seem to serve any usefule purpose. Billed as illuminating the conflict of man and religion, but even that is vague and wishy washy. Mary, take a stand, and tell us more about the planet, the trip, etc."
1,A SLEEPER....,"The idea and concept of the novel seemed intriguing. However, the story never seems to get off the ground. When does the climax come? It was a total bore. Not worth wasting the time to read."
1,Hardly worth the time or praise,"I found this novel to be increadbly poor in all aspects of the novel. Never once was a charater intresting, never once was the story compelling. Morals never seemed to work their way into the story. The Ideals of the novels are strangley familar Almost similar to question Ingmar Bergman posed in his films at thrity years earlier( See winter Light) Hardly intresting. Mary Doria Russel l is No Russell Banks or any kind of writer at all."
1,Don't buy this book unless you like throwing money away,"This book was slow (1/4 backstory), disjointed, confusing and, in short, one of the worst books I've ever read. There was absolutely NO character development so we couldn't get to know any of the people at all. The result, for me, at least, was that I despised everyone in the book and found them very unbelievable.There were many opportunities for Russell to develop her main character, yet she failed to do so, time and time again--I believe she doesn't know how. My advice to readers--don't buy. To Russell--learn to write before attempting to do so."
4,An interesting read with a abrupt ending,"This book was a journey through many emotions, from sheer enlightenment and joy, to true disgust and sorrow. And it kept me interested throughout. My only problem with the story was the abrupt end. We are learning about the Rakhat mission, but we are also reading about the Jesuit priests who are discovering what happened. After the priests hear about the entire trip I would have liked to learn a little bit more of how it affected their lives and beliefs. Also, how it affected their feelings toward Sandoz and towards sending humans to other planets. An interesting thought is if any of the Jesuits would feel a sense of responsibility for the tragedy."
5,A Book I Will Remember,"This is my first book review on Amazon. I wanted to write a review because Amazon recommended this excellent book to me.I agree totally with everything Nicq said in his great review. I am usually a reader of hard hi-tech sci-fi and I think I had forgotten how deeply you can be transported to a strange place by a book.The author has an amazing ability to make you feel at right home, first in a near-future Earth that is much like today's but with some very believable changes, and later in a distant alien place with the people who by now feel like your own friends and family. This makes it very disturbing when your illusions and security are shattered as you share their fates.The story is revealed alternately forward as it occurred and backwards from its aftermath, in a way that builds to a powerful ending.I think I will remember this book long after closing its back cover."
5,Dark and Endearing - A Memorable Read,"An intelligent and compelling book with insight into some of the moral and spiritual dilemmas involved in the search for God. The characters are well drawn and memorable. The fact that you knew most of them would not survive the mission, only made their humor and vitality more poignant. In the two narratives, Ms. Russell did an excellent job of interweaving the darker aspects of the tragedy of the Rakhat mission with the wonderful story of the relationship between these characters before and during the mission. It was disturbing to meet Emilio, a man who has been spiritually and physically ruined; and sadly endearing to meet the man he was before. An unforgettable character and an impressive book. I look forward to reading, Children of God."
3,Interesting cross of science and spirituality.,"I appreciated the idea of the Jesuits ""going where no man has gone before."" What a fascinating extension of their history. I found her earth characters one-dimensional, but it did not inhibit my enjoyment of the book. I found the life forms on Rakhat fascinating. In the end the theology was not very developed, which was disappointing. But I would definitely recommend it as a very good summer read."
2,Dialogue does not fulfill the description of Sandoz.,"Author's prose is weak, integrating lame jokelines with stale plot. She puts in something for everybody and shows no critical selection. The characters are truly stereotypes with no originality. Even the horrors that occur are old and chewed-over. The author sets the reader up with expectations that fizzle with the outcome. The reader hears a lot about who Sandoz is, but never sees him fulfill this characterization in his own dialogue. Although I kept reading it, I now conclude the author would write better non-fiction as she cannot create believable characters or follow though with a strong plot line. More rewrites before publishing might have helped. It seemed to be a rush-job because they DO (as another reviewer pointed out) want to MAKE MONEY ON THE MOVIE which I, for one, will not go to see."
2,Great disappointment,"A wonderful page-turner with a cheap, maudlin ending. I was expecting a diabolically creative plot-twist to explain the protagonist's deep, dark secret. Instead, I find a common plot-device used in the trashiest pulp-SF.This author--with all her intellectual accolades--should have known better. Some could even interpret her ending as homophobic. I just thought it was stupid."
3,Close...,"While this book raises interesting questions: what is God's will? Why are we here? Why do good people suffer?, the author does not have a good Catholic understanding and misrepresents the concept of evangelization, revelation, providence, the sacraments, and missionaries. Some questions she asks have simple enough answers that anyone could find by looking in the Catechism. Overall it was an interesting book concept, but didn't quite deliver for the Catholic reader."
1,The Sparrow,"I got this book at the airport and was intriqued by the introduction and storyline. More than 75% of the book builds to some ""event"" which made for suspensful reading. I enjoyed the writing style but I found the end so ridiculous AND distasteful that I felt ripped off for spending my time reading something with such a ludicrous ending. I was surprised that the reviews were so good. I'm an average person leaning on the liberal side of life...so nothing really shocks me; but in this book it seemed superfluous. Perhaps a better title for Sparrow would be ""Swallow""."
2,not well written,"This book is not very good. The first 100 pages plod along. It's supposed to take place in the future, but the language and references are all 1990s and sooner. The author tries too hard to show how intelligent she is. The peppering of Spanish, often without translation, is annoying."
2,interesting and boring,"The Sparrow is the story of a Jesuit expedition to Rakhat. The part about the actual journey and events is interesting, informed and well written. Another part of the book is about the linguist of the expedition, Emilio, who experiences a moral and religious crisis. This is boring. Emilio, morals and religion are of little consequence to the mission. With another linguist, other morals and another religion the expedition would no doubt have ended it disaster too.The real mistakes are for example the absence of guards and a political advisor on the mission. without political advice the members of the expedition manoeuvre themselves in a weak and dependent position, and become easy prey.So if you don't buy in to the writers analysis you are in for a lot of page skipping."
3,I couldn't finish it,"I tried to read this book a few years ago, and I struggled just to get a quarter of the way through... Then I just put it down. Which is something I rarely ever do. The writting style was so drab I just couldn't get into the book. But I will say I do plan on trying to read it again. If for no other reason than I am curious as to what the hell happened to that priest! I gave it three stars, because it did leave me interested in trying again, plus I can't give it an accurate rating since I didn't finish it.My recommendation would be pick it up used if you are interested..."
3,For true Christians: Might not be what you expected.,"I was not familiar with this author when I bought this book. I thought it sounded like a great story, and it really is a very interesting idea. It was in the Christian fiction 'section' when I was browsing, but it really isn't 'Christian'. An overwhelming force in the book is a Christian society, and the author really makes you think about God's relationship with people. I am actually not going to finish it though. There are just too many situations and opinions in the book that I would say are offensive to God. As a Christian who is always seeking to have a closer relationship with God, I was unable to reconcile reading it and at the same time saying ""I love God."" I equate it to saying on the one hand, ""I love so and so . . . "" and then on the other, entertaining all sorts of horrible things about the person I just claimed to love."
1,I Hated This Book!,"I picked this up from a friend. She thought that I might be interested because of my knowledge of the Catholic Church and a passing interest in science fiction. I Hated This Book! Characters are introduced, developed, and dismissed - dying almost off stage. There is inexplicable brutality and chaotic leaps of faith. I cannot think of a book that I liked less. I forced myself to finish The Sparrow assuming that there would be some redemptive conclusion. I was sadly wrong. I cannot discourage you strongly enough to avoid this book. I have no idea why it gained a measure of success and popularity. It is not good science fiction. It is not interesting ethically, philosophically, or theologically. I did not find it to be particularly well-written."
1,The Worst Book I've Ever Read--Zero Stars,"I was shocked when I found out this book had won an award...until I remembered that Bill Clinton had once been named ""Husband of the Year!"""
3,mediocre but suspenseful,"Russell's characters are on the cardboard and cartoonish side. She takes 240 some pages just to get them on their journey. The theme of the book was done better in the Bible in the Book of Job. Why do bad things happen to good people? What is the purpose of evil in the world? Is God's role to prevent evil from happening to good people?I have read far better fictional examinations of the themes and certainly far better science fiction. When the denouement comes in the last 30 pages, it is anti-climactic because from the beginning of the book the reader is well aware of what happened to the central character. The denouement adds salacious details but no further insight.All of that said, it is suspenseful until the end when the denouement occurs and then you find out it wasn't suspenseful at all."
3,This was a very creative work - but lacked depth.,"I was dissappointed that the author did not address the issues of free will insofar as the main characters seemed to be fatalistic in their views. While Emilio was convinced that he was doing God's will, he never was heard to pray or to communicate with God in any way - one had the feeling that he did not know how. It was hard for me to believe that the author had a full knowledge of what Christianity or Judaism is all about. There was just not enough philosophy of these beliefs to convince one that she really had a deep understanding of Jesuits, the Catholic Church or Judaism - also, one could not tell if she has embraced Orthodox Judaism, Conservative or Reformed Judaism. We do not really know.Despite the foregoing, I found this book to be one that held my interest and moved me emotionally. I just wish she had let us know more about what her characters were thinking as they went along."
3,All that for that?,"Ms. Russell's first attempt at fiction should be applauded at several levels. The character development was superb. This author's ability to create such multi-dimensional subjects make it an easy 3 star book. Furthermore Ms. Russell's scientific background makes the storyline plausible albeit probable. But for all that, I am left with extreme frustration over having read 406 pages only to have Father Sandoz come to some inane conclusion about God. Ms. Russell created Father Sandoz as the epitome of humility and all that can be good about men. Then in the last few pages Father Sandoz becomes this egocentric maniac attempting to answer questions within himself, which I am sure he should have and would have addressed many years earlier.My expectations, built up after 406 pages, were shattered with such a wimpy ending."
3,As beautiful as a spider's web-- and just as sinister,"An unusual science-fiction book-- though it is more religious dialogue and search than it is sci-fi. Ms. Russell's feminism sticks out rather far (the women are the only truly competent and REAL people in the entire book), and the plot proceeds by tiny, circumlocutory steps with frequent and abrupt segues from the present (on Earth) to the actual events that ""need explanation"". These events are doled out almost grudgingly, like sweets to a child whose supper must not be spoiled by their presence. When the book ends, it's with the suddenness of a tropical sunset-- no prelude, and no resolution. It was in many ways an interesting read, but I shall not re-read it."
5,The Sparrow - Mary Doria Russell,"A wonderful blend of science fiction, theology, anthropology and a great story. It was gripping (after a slightly slow start) and haunting. Our book club loved it and had a rousing discussion of its many facets. I have shared it with many people who were also memerized by it. It is one of my ""top five"" books of all time... the newest addition to that list."
5,A NEW CATEGORY IN LITERATURE?,"I just finished two remarkable novels by an incredibly brilliant first time author.The Sparrow was written in 1996 and it's sequel was written in 1998. I feel these two novels would be well served by a third novel in the series. They seem to be perfectly suited to being a trilogy.The author has an outstanding background in anthropology, an incredible mind and a wonderful use of language.I think I have never read a better novel dealing with the subject of radically alien races and cultures. Her solid academic background,experience with religion, imaginative intelligence and authentic good sense contribute to a profound reading experience. After finishing thesecond book, I felt bereft that it was over: somewhat like the way I felt after finishing The Poisonwood Bible.The titles are: ""The Sparrow"" and ""Children of God"" by Mary Doria Russell.They are classified as science fiction but they really need their own classification. Maybe social- science fiction would work."
2,Generally Lacking,"I started this book based on a friend's recommendation and was quite prepared to like it. However, I was rather disappointed by the many loopholes in the plot, not to mention the weak science and a cast of generally idiotic, intolerable, or two-dimensional characters. Although there were flashes of wisdom in the book, it was overshadowed by the author's own judgemental attitudes towards some of the characters. While I found Emilio's struggle to come to terms with his personal tragedy as well as the questions he raises to be profound, by the end of the book, I sensed that because of the author's love for this character, she has bedeviled or antagonized the others to the point that they become rather simplistic."
2,Frustrating to read,"When I finished this book, I put it down and my thought was ""what the hell was that?"" The author takes the reader to a variety of time periods in a non-linear manner and gives a number of scenes where the foreshadowing is heavy-handed but leads to nothing but more fore-shadowing. She draws out her story line painstakingly slowly, and at the resolution there is no feeling of resolution for this reader. I read this book because my book group chose it, otherwise I would never have touched it as futuristic fiction is of no interest to me. I would not recommend it to anyone, and in fact I cannot even categorize it as to what kind of fiction it is. The author seems to be working out her own belief system and religious orientation at the reader's expense. I wish her well."
2,Unusual Space heme,"This book is not for the lineal thinker. The author found some value in shifting back and forth between decades, but I found it confusing and frustrating. The characters are varied and interesting, the plot astonishing, and on the whole the text is well written. There are occasional sparks of clever or even brilliant insight. Point of view moves from one character to another, leaving the reader somewhat adrift. There was enough techno-talk to support the premise of space travel for the average reader. If this is a serious book (and it is), the adolescent aspect of language and smirking over sex could be toned down to advantage. I'm not quite a fan, but the book will remain in memory for a long time. Much to think about."
2,I regret ever starting it,"The Sparrow has an interesting plot idea and excellent character development, however I regret ever starting this book. While the beginning is intriguing and does get you hooked, the book for the most part is too long and dull. I almost gave up on it but decided to keep reading to find out what happened to the characters. So I struggled for weeks to get through the dull part, only to find that the end was all of a sudden very hurried and incredibly disappointing. A big let-down on such an intriguing beginning."
2,"Meh, don't bother.","This is an easy ready but not a worthwhile one. It satisfies in that it doesn't waste time building up to the real action and the meeting of the aliens etc. But the price of the speed to gratification is a total abandonment of reality. Basically a mission is organized to another planet but it's not clear how they got the money to do it and they put a totally inept C-team on the crew, the rag-tag bunch who discovered the alien message. In the end, it could have been a nice book but it feels like it was written very quickly and paid little attention to the science or practicalities of accomplishing the plot. Don't get me wrong, I'm not asking for the engineer's version, just wish I could have bought into it enough to take it seriously. And the characters aren't that good either in case you like that in your science fiction--I ended up not caring about any of them."
3,disappointing,"I eagerly anticipated reading The Sparrow and its sequel, Children of God, based on the glowing reviews it received in the press and the premise of The Sparrow. A Jesuit mission to an unknown planet is an interesting twist, but based on history, also not unprecedented. However, I agree with one of the previous reviewers of this book that the amount of bantering that goes on throughout the book soon becomes pretty annoying, and in my view, detracts from the overall impact. While I can understand the author's wish to humanize the characters by letting us know that even priests can deploy a sense of humour, and GOSH, even swear, the reader soon becomes jaded and wishes that the author would get on with exploration of the new planet and furtherance of the mission that brought them there.I do intend to read the sequel, however, just to see what the author does with the Jesuit priest's theological impasse. Overall, I don't think the book merited the sensational reviews it received."
2,Jesuits uninterested in spirituality?,"The question which I was left with at the end of this book was this: why did the Jesuit priests fail to inquire into the spiritual life of the aliens? Yet the main character continued to believe that spirituality existed on the strength of the beauty of the songs of the Singer. Of course, if they had so inquired they would have found the aliens to be devoid of spirituality which might have raised some red flags and ruined the author's tale. In the end, I was disappointed in this contrived plot."
3,Where are the real aliens??,"Biggest problem with this book was the characterization of the aliens -- they are exceedingly dull and much too human. Everything is about commerce and trading and shipping and all the boring crap you never studied in history or economics. I'm not looking for bug-eyed mutants, but the alien world just felt like 17th century Europe.Yawn."
4,A fine first contact story,"This is a very surprising and entertaining look at ""first contact."" Although it can get a little cheesy at points (sometimes the characters are just a little too ""precious"" and some of the situations a little too obviously set-up), it is a really fun and thought-provoking read: especially in exploring how much significance that first contact will mean to the individual humans involved"
5,Thought-provoking; entertaining; can't put down book!,"After years of reading sci-fi, this book defies description or categorization. Russell is to be commended for the charater development, but the pace of the story keeps the reader hooked. The interweaving of culture, religion, science fiction/fantasy/space travel is pure entrapment. But the best part is after you've finished with the book and you desperately want to find someone to talk it over with - so you recommend it to everyone - even strangers in the grocery! I had to wait for Children of God to be published, but the sequel is no less compelling than The Sparrow. Run, don't walk, to get these books!"
4,Difficult but thought provoking read,"The author's prosaic writing style did not immediately engage me and I almost put the book down two-thirds of the way through. I'm glad I stuck with it - although it turns out to be a harrowing story with no easy answers. The author has tackled the subjects of faith, suffering, cultural clashes, love and betrayal. She has done it remarkably well for a first time novelist. The story will stay with me for a long time."
1,Star Trek meets Encyclopedia Britannica,"Or more like a rejected script for Star Trek. Perhaps it would have been better at half the length, as some sections of 5-10 pages had no apparent reason for being, unless the reader really, really wants to know about agriculture on Rakhat. Yes, bad things happen to good people, but we already knew that. What more do we know after reading this book?"
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!!!,"This is a must-read book for anyone who is interested in science fiction, theology or aspects of human relationship. I found that this - and its sequel - are outstandingly written and should be read by all.GET THIS BOOK!!"
2,"Good writing, but sordid story","The writing and charactierization were very good. However, I like to read books which are informative or uplifting. This one made me feel like I had taken a roll in muck."
2,Too slow in the beginning and never speeds up...,"Sharing one of the reviewr's opinions below, I'm writing this review to pull down the average rate of the book. The synopsis and reviews sounded very promising, and I hoped to read some clever SF that I'm missing so much. The book definetely has its potential, but it starts slowly, painfully slowly.. tantalising the reader ... constant leaps to the past seemed often irrelevant. The characters are plain and dry with funny French last names. When they died, I felt no sympathy. Mr. Sandoz was the only one who evoked pity in me with his misery and because those other Jesuits were plaguing him constantly, but as the enigma of what happened to him was dangled in front of me for too long, when he told his awful story in the last chapters of the book, it never had the effect the author probably has planned it would do."
2,Haunting and horrifying,"My reaction to this book was much the same as ""Reader's."" The book is beautifully written, and the author crafted characters about whom a reader can truly care. I was mesmerized by a tale so wonderfully and deeply original, and I could not put the book down. But as the story progressed toward its ending, it changed into something sinister -- filled with shocking images and events. A bright promise and a fantastic read turned into a tale of unimaginable savagery. It was as though two different authors had written the story. Like ""Reader, ""I could not wait to physically separate myself from this book. My father taught me a deep respect of the written word, but this novel sickened me so much I was actually compelled to throw this book away. My apolgies to the author, but she has the talent to do better than to taint her work with graphic horror and sadism."
1,Overpriced for the Kindle edition,"The book itself is enjoyable, however as the Kindle format costs more than the printed that seems a little absurd."
4,Worth the time.,"I believe that this book is worthwhile reading. With all the speculation about aliens in our universe, Russell brings to light an interesting new point of view. I really cared about the characters, and their situation. It also struck a chord in my imagination and my fear of being alone. This is a great read for anyone who enjoys works that invoke an emotional response."
2,"interesting idea, flawed execution","This book suffers from an all too-common affliction of SF and mystery novels: characters that are more caricatures than fully-realized creations. Ms. Russell tests her readers credulity in the service of her thesis. The ideas driving the novel are admittedly interesting ones, particularly the age-old question of why God, if He exists, allows bad things to happen to good people. The plot in this novel is so preposterous, however, that it becomes an irritant that obscures the ideas it tries to convey. Add to this a continuing string of anachronisms and unbelievable references made by the characters. Will people in the middle of the next century still be attuned to references to TV shows, grade-B movies, and pop culture of the 1960's -90's. The self-referential interview at the end of the paperback adds insult to injury."
3,Change the ending a little...,"...and it would have been a different story if DW, the gay cowboy Jesuit leader, had been the one gang raped by the aliens instead of the sensitive, straight Jesuit, Emilio Sandoz."
5,Fascinating intriguing novel,"This is the best book I have read in quite awhile. It is one of those books you want to share with others but it is hard to describe with the right complexity and character development.Mary Doria Russell makes it clear that she does not intend for there to be evil, scary villains in this book. Horrifying things occur, to be sure, but the from the point of view of Rakhat's people, equally horrifying things occur on Earth as we all bungle through this journey called life.From the life described on Rakhat, to who the explorers are, to the exploration of faith, to the delving into the human psyche, to the meaning of kindness and love and friendship - it is all in this book, and all fascinating and truly thought provoking."
3,Good story - shaky writing,"This is an excellent, entertaining story. As long as you're not picky about insisting that everything you read be good literature, you'll probably enjoy this. The writing is, at best, average - lots of cliches, one dimensional characters, etc. But - it's a good story in spite of the fact that it's not particularly well written."
2,Interesting premise .... Shallow theology,"Russell comes up with a unique perspective: The Jesuits seek out another worldly culture just like they did during the last 400 years or so. But her theology is shallow and weak. These Jesuits do not attempt to convert at any point in the book. She takes a radical approach to Catholic faith by alluding to female ordination (by having a main character, Ann, being told by the Jesuits that she'd make a fine priest - why I don't know because Ann is an atheist/agnostic) and by having the Superior General of the Jesuits (who's character resembles John Wayne with a very heavy Texas accent)revealing that he is a homosexual. Not good enough for a very contrived sequel. Readers would be better off with Canticle to Liebowitz by Miller, Dune by Herbert, or A Fire Upon the Deep by Vinge. There is more general theology in these books than this shallow attempt by Russell."
3,What's With These Guys?,"I just finished this book and am on a wait list at my public library for the sequel. That I want to continue the story of Emilio and company pretty much gives my opinion of the story. The literary qualities are another matter. The characters were quite predictable for the most part and at times I just wanted Russell to get on with it. One thing troubled me throughout the book. Why did the Jesuits assume that Emilio wound up in his final situation on Rakhat of his own volition? It never occurred to me that there were not mitigating circumstances at least, or coercion at most, to lead Emilio to where he was found. Am I a softie or did I miss something? The overriding question of why God gets the credit but never the blame while hardly original is an interesting question to ponder. Some would argue that it was taken up too ponderously here. But I still thought it was a pretty good yarn."
3,"Good, but with flaws","This is essentially well written, with an extremely interesting and novel approach to first contact. Except for the last 50 or so pages it would be a 4 or 5. However, the aliens take an all too familiar theme - they are anthropomorphized into evil humans, with all the faults and immorality associated with evil humans. One would not expect a civilization on a distant planet to have the same good and evil mentality as humans, yet they do, even committing the act of rape on a priest. While this one incident was essential to the story, I felt it was a defect in the plot development, an predictable and unsatisfactory direction she took the novel when she could have done much better. But there is enough good aspects in the novel to recommend it."
5,A real page-turner...,"This book is excellant. From the beginning Mary Doria Russell draws you into the characters (especially Emilio). Once characters' histories have been detailed and linked together (lengthy but worth it as it brings you closer to them), Mary goes on to describe a world full of vision.The religious background to this book also raises fundamental questions (i'm not religious) about morality. The life on Rakhat also gives an insight, I feel, into the the widening gap of capitalism in our world and that Mary was attempting to make us see the savagery that can result with the accumulation of power.All in all a great read and well worth the money."
3,Pretty good story; banal philosophy,"I won't criticize the story...it was fairly well-wrought for a 1st-time author. But the major philosophical question, i.e., the existence of evil in the presence of an all-good God, is simply too banal to warrant any further exploration. J.L. Mackie ripped theism to shreds using the very problem back in the 50s."
4,Fascinating and provocative,"A fascinating and wholly original imagining of first contact with extraterrestrial life. A suspense story that builds patiently, dropping tantalizing crumbs along the way. Most profoundly, a meditation on the hard questions about God's involvement in our daily affairs, and his responsibility for evil in the universe.I'm surprised to read so much praise for Doria Russel's characters, as they are the only aspect of the novel that keeps me from giving 'The Sparrow' a five-star rating. I found secondary characters like Voelker, Anne and Supaari to be more believable and fully imagined than the protaganist Emilio Sandoz, and his cardboard attraction Sofia. That aside, this is a powerful novel you will not soon forget."
3,The Disappointment,"When I first started to read this book I couldn't put it down. I loved all the characters and their relationships with each other and was interested in the space travel, etc. The last quarter of the book, however, seemed to be rushed and seemed to be leading to a sequel. (Sure enough, I found out that indeed there was a sequel.) As interested in the characters as I am, the sequel has no attraction for me. I was that disappointed!"
3,"Good, but not my cup of tea","This was a book club choice- the genre is not my cup of tea - However, as the person who chose the book said - it turned out to be very good"
4,The Sparrow - A great read and a solid first effort!,"I heard an interview on the radio with Mary Doria Russell on the Diane Ream show a couple of months ago. She was such an energetic and interesting guest author I just knew I had to pick up her book and that it was going to be a great read. She did not disappoint me. Russell has written a wonderful book in this reader's opinion. She captures the personalities of her main characters exceptionally well and their dialogue often made me laugh out loud. This was a good book which I recommended to my brother-in-law, a future Episcopal Priest, and to my husband, an electrical engineer. They both have read it and they really enjoyed it. Let's hear it for the talent coming out of Cleveland! Who says that town is simply the ""mistake by the lake!"" I eagerly await her sequel to this work"
4,"A Unique Mix of Ethics, Religion, and Aliens","Unique book. Mixture of Religion, Adventure, and thoughtful science fiction. Human frailties and strengths are presented. Although mildly depressing at times the reality of the book pertaining to human emotions and future society is worth the read. I especially liked the question format at the conclusion of the book. The author has done a commendable writing. I look forward to reading ""Children of God"" the followup to ""The Sparrow."" I believe Dr. Russell can sequence this series similar to Philip Jose Farmer's Riverworld Series written over a quarter a century ago. Dr. Russell's ""The Sparrow"" is a thinker's book and not just an action novel. I look forward to her future novels."
4,"Unforgettable, If Flawed","Mary Doria Russell's mix of extraterrestrial first-contact with questions of faith and fate is really remarkable -- and this book is a shockingly good debut novel. I consider it one of the most memorable books I've read, and yet... it's got an enormous flaw. As if she suddenly realized that her book had a page limit, Russell drops most of the interesting elaborations she uses for the first 80% of the book and rushes the ending. But even that flaw doesn't stop my high rating -- ""The Sparrow"" is a thoughtful examination of faith, feeling, and the meaning of life... _wherever_ it exists in the universe."
5,"Moving, Compelling Novel","This is a novel about the human spirit, about consequences of one's best intentions, and about what it means to have a relationship with the divine. It falls in the science fiction genre in that Russell needed a set piece to deal with first contact with an alien culture - and, as she points out in the end notes, there aren't any such cultures left on Earth anymore. The book doesn't delve deeply into the ""hard"" sciences (like David Brin's ""Earth"") but instead delves into the more ""human"" sciences of anthropology and culture. It also digs deep into the heart of the reader. This is a gorgeous novel. Don't miss it!"
5,Made my Top Ten,"I read this book and its sequel several years ago. I still talk about it and recommend it to friends. It's one of the most unusual and thought-provoking books I've ever read. My three sisters loved it too but our 83-year old mother could not ""get into it."" One of the TOP TEN books I've ever read. Normally I don't read sci-fi but this book is not typical. It's hard to categorize it."
4,"Exciting, Profound Page Turner","absolutely wacky, spellbinding book. Jesuit priests in space on the search for God and how being religious and pious doesn't mean you are going to have a good life after all. That is, there is nothing in the books that says believing in God and abiding by him means you are going to loved and comforted. This point is captured in the most sexually violent form. On another level, this book captures the moral complexities of entering a new society in complete ignorance and how little things can lead to huge consequences (the butterfly effect). Strongly recommend."
2,The time dilation physics is spectacularly incorrect!,"Time dilation is critical to the plot of this novel. Yet it is completely wrong as it stands in this book. As the trip is laid out in this tale, there would be *no* time dilation to speak of; yet the author assumes a huge time dilation factor. How an error as glaring as this could make it into a published novel is beyond me. But not as far beyond me as the fact that no one seems to notice!"
3,"Well-wrought, if not over-wrought . . .","Dissapointed! All of the bad qualities of an Anne Rice novel without the juicy parts. I supposed if you'd never thought about 'why God allows bad things to happen to OK people,' this might help you begin that meditation. Otherwise, readers get to see interesting characters and their associated plot strings terminated, one by one. This simplifies the author's task but leaves her readers with little more than a thinly draped academic discussion of cruelty and death within the context of conventional notions of God."
5,Wow. Just wow.,"This is one of the 2 most amazing books I have encountered as an adult (the other one being its sequel, Children of God). It's highly entertaining, and the 2 books have a quite unexpected result. I don't even want to spoil the ending of the second book. Personally, I consider the 2 volumes to simply be a single book, split in 2, so while I initially found the ending of The Sparrow to be so disturbing I could not return to the book for almost 20 years (though I would not part with my copy of Children of God for love or money), I returned to it and, knowing how the entire work ends I no longer have a problem with the end of The Sparrow; after all, it is only the middle of the story, and as a whole it is a great story. Yes, there is a religious bent to it (Well, it IS about a Jesuit mission to a planet near Alpha Centauri) nut it is not overpowering and the narrative is just so compelling."
3,Good for book groups,"At first, I refused to read this book because it was described as science fiction. After several different friends recommended it, I gave it a shot, and was pleasantly surprised. This is a good read for book groups that are comfortable with themes of spirituality and space travel (strange combo, though it is).It is a thought-provoking book and my book group had quite a lively debate when we discussed it. I found the middle to be a bit long and the ending to be a bit short. Worth reading, but do not finish this late at night. The ending is haunting."
2,Nothing new nothing much.,I found this book to pose very few intresting questions. THe charaters where unlikakbe and not well drawn. The narrative it's self is very sketchy and is more confussing than compelling. Very little intresting of orignal craftmanship went into bot the form and content this book.
4,A Graham Greene Character's outer and inner space,"Russell's strength in this splendid novel lies in her fully realized characterizations, espcially of the main character, Emilio Sandoz. This embattled Jesuit Priest character, with his tortured, forced recollections of unspeakable horrors encountered on the perverse-artist ruled planet of Rakhat, remninds me of Graham Greene's characters--basically good people put to spirit-crushing tests. The alien culture on Rakhat is compelling in its blend of the familiar and the exotic, and the chapter-to-chapter switching from present to past is artfully accomplished. Well worth the time--read it at night!Crossfire (Cosmic Crossfire)"
4,Probably the best speculative science fiction since Bradbury,"After I finished this book, I remembered a quote ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"". This is very intelligent writing by a mature and well rounded individual. The characters are well developed, the hard science regarding space travel seems plausible, and its obvious the author did her homework--she probably didn't need to, the story is allegorical. There are some plot points that need to be cleaned up, but I suspect that is why there is a sequel which I have already downloaded to my kindle. This book isn't for everybody and it's not quick reading, but well worth it if you like thoughtful fiction."
4,"Oh know, Jesuits in outerpace!",A friend commented to me how sad she was about the difficulties encountered by the main character. My response was by asking how was his any different than what the Jesuits encountered when they came to explore the Americas. THE SPARROW is interesting enough to read even if it is unbelieveable in parts.
2,Not worth the time,"Ok, this book has a very good and intreguing idea and plot. The thought of two clashing worldviews from two entirely different planets is very good (and also over used, but that's ok). However, this book is very wordy and detailed. Details are good because one can truely understand the character. These details do not prove helpful in this book, but rather bog down the reading useless facts. The ending is rather disturbing, but is a good finishing point of the book. If you don't have a lot of time to waste, then don't read it. Find another book."
2,Very disappointing,"I don't understand why the author chose to punish her main character, a Jesuit priest, in this repellent, extreme fashion. This book could have been something special; instead, the reader feels weary and disgusted after finishing the last page. No pay-off, no illumination, no human dignity upheld. What's the point in the end?On the positive side, I did appreciate some of the characters--but felt that the author didn't really let them breathe properly. They all seemed merely to exist as part of the ""set-up"" for the nasty denouement."
3,Sparrow is clumsy and unbelievable,"I very much agree with the last review that said this is NOT a great book. I give it 3 stars because the author put some thought into some of the ideas. I found much of the dialogue to be pointless and mundane. When the dialogue attempts to be instructive to the reader, I found it both irritatingly simplistic and condescending at once. The story, although it explores some possibly interesting ideas, is completely unbelievable - although this is fine for science fiction writing, the author attempts to give it credibility via character development but it just falls flat.The only suspense is wading through muddy moment after moment to find out what we already knew from the very beginning."
3,If you can get past the insipid sci-fi setting...,"This is a good, good read. Emilio is a powerful charcter-- and as the book changes settings and time frames, you find yourself desperate to find out how a man such as himself ended up so broken. The setting, though, is ridiculous. I felt as though two books, by two authors were smushed into one-- the first is a fantastic story about the human condition, and the second is the type of brainless sci-fi suitable only for airplanes. However, once I ignored the setting, the book was great."
1,Immoral Aliens,"This was the WORST book I have ever read. The lone star that I gave this book goes to the author for her efforts in writing it.I was encouraged to read this by all the amazing 5 star reviews and once I was done, I felt defiled.I can appreciate good books, too....but this?? ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.Sex addicts might enjoy this read."
2,Not C.S. Lewis in my book,To portray life on another planet as so sadistic and cruel and humans as so scientifically advanced is a denial of the genre itself. I prefer Lewis and his portrayal of those other worlds!
