3,slim for the money,"there is a novella based on a true story that is horrific, but the true crime has no happy ending, why the writer melowed it down is beyond me. so the novella aint that good.two bonus stories are excellent as most of mr. ketchums stories.the book is only over 100 pages, not worth the money"
2,unreal... but it could happen,"I found this a not so well developed story fantastic, pretty cruel and exaggerated.. Unrealistic because of the details and how they are presented, but it's main crime could happen!"
1,What's the point?,"This was over the top. I don't get the point. It starts off right away with totally unbelievable stuff happening to this woman and gets more and more rediculous. It's so unbelievable, I don't know why he even bothered to write a story around the awful things that happen to her. Why not just write down whatever twisted, demented thing you've ever wanted to do to a woman, and print it? There's no point to this story at all. Don't waste your time or money. I was disappointed and embarrassed. I took it off my coffee table when people came over. Not his finest work by a long shot."
5,A Great deal for the money,I just received my router and I am very pleased with it. I have never owned a plunge and so the weight took some getting used to. When I was shopping for a plunge router all the other 3.25HP routers were selling for about ... more the the Freud and since I would Freud router bits and the reviews at the time were positive I went for it. Amazon was offering a $15 coupon and a free edge guide at the time. So I paid a little of ...I believe. Nice going Amazon and the router is great.
4,Dostoyevsky for the TV viewer,"I purchased this 4 DVD set after taking a lifelong learning course based on the novel. The DVDs were used to supplement the novel. The English subtitles allow one to follow the story without a knowledge of the Russian language. If one speaks Russian, they could enjoy this excellent dramatization.One primary short-coming for persons who do not speak or read Russian is the lack of a translation for the use instructions in English or other languages.This problem could be solved by including a printed insert with the instructions in English or an English translation of the Russian words."
3,Difficult to follow,"I have read this wonderful novel, so I purchased the film in order to interest a friend in reading it too.The film was difficult to follow. The novel is the better choice."
3,Idiot,"Apparently one of Dostoyevsky's more obtuse works, the lack of audio in English and VERY POOR SUB-TITLES (some parts are just gibberish, written I think by a Russian who has a basic, working knowledge of English rather than by an English speaker who has a good knowledge of Russian) meant that I found it very heavy going. I think I need to find a good translation of the novel and watch it over again to even get a rough idea of what it is all about.If nothing else the sub-titles to this visually impressive movie lends a great deal of weight to the idea that sub-titles should first be written by a native speaker of the language in which the movie is set and then vetted by a native speaker of the target language."
4,Review of The Idiot,I have enjoyed what I have seen so far. I have not completed watching all of it.
3,"Funny movie,awful print","The dvd of this is a real let-down.The picture quality is really washed out.If you can put up with this,Hope is on good form,the story is above average and Jack Benny's brief appearance is a hoot.Shame about the transfer,though..."
2,pass this one up,"The Brentwood version is of very poor quality. I love Bob Hope movies, but I'm sorry I spent the money on this one!"
3,Goodness!,"I LOVE Doughmakers products. By far my favourite cooking tool. Having said that... I'd wanted a muffin tin that was a little larger than the stock standard (which I find great for cupcakes but a little smallish for muffins). When they arrived, the tins ended up being more the size of moderate cakes! They're HUGE! If you're after massive, these are the ones for you! Unfortunately they're just too big for my purposes.Oddly too, one of my tins was kind of twisted - not dead flat. That's not exactly what I've come to expect from Doughmakers so that was a little disappointing. But give I live in Australia, there was no way to really address the issue."
2,"Beware, double-batch makers! Two pans don't fit in one oven!","I've been sold on Doughmakers products for years. I own a whole collection of their bakeware, and I've been more than happy with all the items. The last bakeware I had to replace was my muffin pans. I make double batches of cookies and cupcakes, so I ordered two of these. They're beautiful. Solid aluminum, guaranteed not to rust. HOWEVER... upon using them for the first time, both pans were dented as I tried to close the oven door, and the door did not close. They do not fit lengthwise in a standard sized large oven! If you bake double batches, you cannot place these side by side. If you only bake one batch at a time, they're fine. If you make 24, just buy ONE pan and be prepared to spend twice the time in the kitchen making a second batch. I'm more than shocked that Doughmaker's designed something with such a glaring flaw. Very disappointed!"
1,Never Fit Right,"My son loved to be swaddled during his first months, but this product never fit him right. It would gap and he could put his arms out and eventually wriggle it loose. We tried it a few times and then put it in the donation bag. Old-fashioned swaddling with receiving blankets worked much better (and is less expensive)."
2,A great idea with poor execution,"Our baby loves to be swaddled, so when she started to outgrow the receiving blankets we had, we purchased the Swaddle Me large size. It only comes in large or small. She was 14+ pounds when we bought it, so within their weight range for that size.It's a great idea, but the Swaddle Me is far far too big for her. It goes around her one a half times. It's as if the people who made the blanket never tested it on real babies. You can't make it tight enough to get that cozy feeling that is the whole point of swaddling. There is only a small space where the velcro tabs stick. I don't understand why they don't make the whole blanket sticky for the velcro (it's not scratchy) so that you could secure it as tightly or loosely as you need to.For our next baby I will purchase The Miracle Blanket instead, and that is what I would recommend to anyone looking for a swaddle blanket."
1,Save your money,"I expected great things from this blanket since Baby Bargains raved about it. Save your money and buy an Amazing Miracle Blanket instead. The velcro is annoying, and my daughter could wiggle out of this way too easily. She never got out of the Amazing Miracle Blanket, even at 6 months (I swaddled her when we were traveling and she had a hard time sleeping). Skip the swaddleme and get an Amazing Miracle Blanket. I swear I don't work for them--it's just that the blanket design is amazing and miraculous!"
1,Did not work for me,"I purchased this product because I liked the idea of being able to easily remove the leg pouch to change diapers. I purchased the small which is designed to fit 7 to 14 lbs. The first time I used it, I realized it did not fit my son. Although he weighs 9 1/2 lbs., the wing stretched far past the velcro fastener. My husband and I watched him wiggle his arm free in 15 minutes. I would suggest that you just purchase a regular receiving blanket. Just make sure it is large enough (about 30x40) so that you have enough fabric to effectively wrap your baby."
3,Useful if your child is not a kicker,"I think this is a great product if you want to swaddle your child quickly and easily. However, there are a couple of things to note:-- if your baby wakes themselves up by kicking around then this is not the best choice. There is not enough swaddling for the feet and so these swaddlers worked only when our daughter was placed sleeping at an incline or in a bouncer chair where we used another blanket to tuck her in, just around her feet.-- fabric choice is important because our daughter would get her hands out of the 100% stretchy cotton swaddle. She was not able to do that with the fleece or the flannel swaddles.All in all, the product was useful, but not perfect for our girls needs!"
2,Not very snug,"We had received one of these as a baby gift. First it was too big. After my daughter had grown into it, she was able to get her arms out and it was never very snug, so she wouldn't like it very much. It's not a bad product, but it just doesn't work as well as a blanket."
4,"great idea, but runs small and did not work for us","The product is well made and looks very cute. Unfortunately my baby did not like the ""restraint"" at all, so we did not use it.If i have to buy it again i would buy a size bigger as i found that they run rather small."
5,A Must for New Parents,Our 2 week old cannot stay a sleep longer than 10 minutes without her hands and feet waking her up.Thanks to the Swaddler we are able to get her to sleep for a full 3 hours (or until she wakes up to be feed).This is a must have for any new parents.
5,Great for a newborn.,A must-have for a newborn baby. I would not recommend buying the larger size because my older baby does not like being so wrapped up. Would definitely suggest getting this for a newborn baby. It is so convenient and secure. Works best if you swaddle with a regular swaddle blanket (like the hospital kind) and then put this over the top. Baby will stay warm and cozy and safe.
3,Not THAT good,"My son got his hands out very quick... The blanket makes some holes when you close it, and h√© got his hands outside... And that is enough to wake him up :(I rate it 3 stars cuz of that... But its cheap, so i Will survive :)"
1,Inferior Product,"The product failed in every respect - the velcro stopped sticking within a week (we bought three and had to throw each one away after a week of use because they no longer functioned). In addition, the non-microfleece version stretched, which means your baby can wrangle out of the swaddle - rendering it ineffective at best. They need to take this product off the shelves and rethink its design and the quality of materials used in its construction - very dissappointing,"
2,Not for Baby Houdinis!,"I was reluctant to invest in a blanket specifically for swaddling, but after a few weeks of making due with regular blankets, I tried the SwaddleMe wrap. While it is reasonably priced, cute and easy to use, my little guy found it easy to ""escape"", both from the size-appropriate blanket, and from the smaller size. I just couldn't keep his arms secure or tightly wrapped. Swaddling at night makes all the difference for my baby, so I'll continue to do it, but I'm back to my low-tech system: receiving blanket and tape."
2,"Creative idea, but a waste of money","We tried this product when our son was 2 weeks of age, but he broke right out of it within minutes and the velco scratched his skin up a little bit. Plain old receiving blankets are much nicer to use and are more multi-purpose unlike this product."
2,Don't bother,This did not work for us at all. I found that I couldn't get it wrapped around our newborn without her kicking it off. If you know how to swaddle then use the hospital blanket or another thin blanket made of cotton.
3,Micro fleece works better for my son,"I've been wrapping my son with micro fleece swaddle-me for a few months without any problem. He was 5 months old and using the size large. I thought to give this cotton one a try since it is getting warmer. This cotton material is nice and soft and thin. I like the soft feeling of it, but it doesn't work very well to hold my son's limbs tucked in. One morning he woke up with one of his fists out from the top and the other one from the middle opening, and I don't know how he did it but his legs were busted out from the pouch which has never happened with the micro fleece.I have 2 kids and invested in several baby wraps includes highly rated expensive Miracle Wrap, but the micro fleece swaddle-me has worked the best for us."
2,Other products are better,"If this is the only swaddle blanket you have ever used i can see saying its tje greatest thing ever, however its not my first one. This product is much more difficult to put on and certainly not as diaper changing friendly as they make it sound. You have to undo the inside velcro then attempt to put it back again after. Also, my very sneaky 7 week old easily wiggles his arms free so that his hands are poking out the top then wakes up. My kids are very long and they, at 7 weeks and only about 8.5 lbs, are already almost too tall for this product.The reason I bought these was because the halo fleece sleepers got too warm with wood heat but I must say even too warm the halo sleepers are a million times better! I got size small which my boys are swimming in amnd I can still wrap them more tightly and change them easier.These are definately not my favorite by far, I think I swaddle with a blanket better."
5,Great swaddle!!,Purchased this for our daughter and she absolutely loves it. Used it right away and was able to get 4 hours of continous rest. Great product.
2,Don't bother...,"We got this as a gift and have used it 0 times. It's expensive and poorly designed. A large receiving blanket works well and is cheaper, easier to fold, and nicer looking."
1,Wish I Could Have Tried It,"I would like to give this item a fair review but I never received it. I have a new four month old that recently grew out of his swaddle blankets. He needed a new swaddler but this item never came. It said it was shipped out??? Anyhow, I bought a similar one at Babies r Us and it was on sale too. If anyone knows how to dispute this purchase with amazon, please, let me know."
3,A bit too stretchy,This item runs large because it is so stretchy. Other than that it worked great. We had used the fleece ones before and bought the cotton one when it started getting warmer.
3,Not so great.,"Didn't work for me, the material is kind of cheap, and not warm at all. A flannel material would have been better. I don't recommend."
5,great product great seller,great product.. and very happy with the seller. Item arrived on time and in great condition. The swaddleMe is the perfect size. Loved how easy it is to use..we no longer use it but highly recommend.
2,too stretchy,"Our baby is wiggly and we had to wrap this very snugly. In the middle of the night, though, she would sometimes wake up scared because it was so tight. When we wrapped it more loosely, she quickly wiggled her arms out and would wake herself when her arms flailed about. Like another reviewer experienced, a couple times our baby awoke with the swaddle me bunched up tightly around her neck. That was the last straw. Our baby was 8-12 pounds when we tried it. Now we use simple squares of flannel from a fabric store."
2,Not for me.......,"I bought this after reading about all the benefits of swaddling but after using it a few times I realized that this was not for my baby. I live in the Caribbean and quite frankly swaddling is not commonly done here. The nurses do it in the hospital but it is not taught or suggested for home use. I never did it with my first child but decided to give it a go for my son.The first time I used it(during his first week at home), he slept in it ok for a while but when he awoke and found that his movements were constricted he cried non stop until I removed him from it. My mom absoluted hated this thing and compared it to being in a straight jacket and she was convinced that it was keeping it too hot.I gave in and stopped using it. I guess this is a cultural thing and may work for some but I am sorry to say it was not a hit in our home."
2,Helps baby sleep,"This product did help my 5 mo old sleep better, as she cannot move her arms around and kick her feet which wakes her up. However it ripped very soon after we got it, around the velcro patch in the center. You are supposed to pull the left part down and velcro it to the middle patch on the babies lower abdomen area. Well there are holes that are growing larger and larger each time we use it. It could have been made with higher quality stitching and material."
5,An easy way to swaddle,"This is a great product. Because I had a large baby, I was only able to swaddle my baby a few weeks with the traditional blanket wrap. This wrap easily accommodates him and does not come undone like the blanket. He sleeps better when swaddled and I do not have to worry about loose bedding covering his face should he wiggle free. I tried another brand (First Years) and the shoulder opening is too large and he was able to wiggle both arms out as soon as I laid him down. This brand is by far the best. I purchased three of them so one is always ready."
5,Gotta love it!,"Love this item. They are easy to use and snuggly fit your baby (if you get the right size of course :D) Relaxes baby, who hates to be swaddled too loosely with a receiving blanket. This does the job!"
5,Holds a wiggly baby very well...,My baby stays put! The velcro actually holds my very wiggly baby! He sleeps better at night.
5,Stays in place!,"I love the SwaddleMe blankets. Until they are older and more mobile they, keep a baby snug and secure and prevent them from startling and waking themselves up in the night. Maybe I'm just swaddling challenges, but I can never make a secure swaddle with a regular blanket. With the SwaddleMe, it is extremely easy to make a swaddle that stays in place."
5,Love it!,We love this product. We started with the size small in fleece and now own 2 size large. I agree that the baby can get his arms out but even now that my son is 4 months old we use it and just don't wrap his arms inside of it. I like the feeling that the blanket doesn't get anywhere near his face.
4,Love this velcro swaddle,"It always seemed that no matter how many times we swaddled our son, we could never get it tight enough. This solves that problem. Our little boy was nice and snug in this and slept like a log once we wrapped him up. The material did make me worry a little bit about whether the baby would overheat, but he never did. This is a great product."
3,not as nice as the fleece swaddle wrap,"I purchased both the fleece and the cotton swaddle blanket for my newborn son. The fleece wrap is WONDERFUL!! It keeps him warm and snug, stays in place very well, and is very easy to use. The cotton wrap; however, is not as well designed. I thought it would be nice for warmer weather, but my 2 week old son can squirm out of it very easily. He does not sleep well in it at all. Frankly, I am amazed that it is made by the same company."
5,helps baby sleep better!,very nice. easy to use. highly recommended. baby always seemed to manage to escape his blankets- this he can not get out of :)
4,This is a magic blanket!,The first time we used this blanket our two month old baby slept through the night. (9 hours!) It was a life saver. The only downside is that they actually come in three sizes. Babies R US online only carries the medium size. It is too big for our baby so she can wiggle out of it and one time ended up with it around her neck. (it didn't impair her breathing though)
3,"It's too big and stretches out, hoping baby will grow into it soon!","I bought this swaddle for my son who currently weighs about 16 and a half pounds. He outgrew the one he has had since he was born so I went to the next size up. The stated size is supposed to be for babies 15-22 lbs. He gets out of it constantly and we have to re-wrap him at night which is frustrating and exhausting. I know he will fit in it better soon, but the sizing is off. It also tends to get stretched out after a few nights of use and then needs to be washed and dried to shrink back. There should be an in between size! When my son weighed 14 lbs he was too big for the small/med size and now he is too small for the large."
3,Shrunk in the wash.... buy bigger size,"We love snuggies! I bought both a micro fleece one and this cotton one, both size large. The microfleece is perfect! This cotton one shrunk to almost a small size and I REALLY NEED A LARGER size for my lil man. However, it's very lightweight and soft and is perfect for warmer nights when you just want a little something over them. Just buy a big size, because it really shrinks."
4,kinda big,"I think this is a great product. I probably just prefer to swaddle my baby really tight. You can only swaddle the baby to certain point, because of where the velcro is placed. I wanted to swaddle him tight enough so that he could slide his arms out, but the product wouldn't let me. He's still a newborn, only about 10 pounds and this was the smallest size they had, so it's not like I could get a smaller size for him. Good product, but if you're wanting to swaddle your baby tight, this product is not recommended. Target sells a blanket made from a material kind of like long johns. This is my favorite blanket to swaddle with. It stretches and keeps the baby swaddled."
3,Too large for newborn,"Unless you have a newborn over 10 lbs., this blanket is too stretchy and the tabs are too far apart to truly wrap up the baby. But once the baby gets older, such as my son who is about 15 lbs. now, the blanket is pretty useful to swaddle during warm days. Another minor downfall is the tiny tab that holds the bottom piece together. It comes apart easily because of the velcro is so small."
2,Too Stretchy!,"My son lived in his Kiddopotamus fleece until he outgrew it/it got too hot. When we went up a size, I got the cotton knit, figuring it would be a similarly fantastic product. Unfortunately, I was mistaken.The whole idea of swaddling is to keep baby nice and tightly snuggled in, and the fleece did a fantastic job because it didn't have much stretch. The cotton knit can be stretched to about two times its length. My (formerly blissfully quietly sleeping) three-month-old would wiggle out within 15 minutes and wail until I'd rescue him and repeat the process. I eventually threw it out.The other drawback to all the Kiddo's is that they use velcro. So if you have an angel who will sleep through diaper changes (they do exist!) you will absolutely certainly wake him or her while unfastening the velcro. I found that the Amazing Miracle Blanket was a five-star product. Once I got that one, I even gave up on the fleece Kiddo!"
3,Shrunk after two washes,A somewhat useful product but it shrunk and the kid outgrew this in a week. Perhaps we should have bought a bigger size.
2,Too big,"Blanket was too big in the large size for 21 inch baby at 9 lbs. They have 2 sizes but no chart to figure out which size you need. The velcro tabs are small and she could easily slip out. I'm waiting until the baby is bigger to use it, but we're in the third month and still waiting. Other reviews have said the small was too small, so I'm not sure. Would recommend Miracle Blanket; costs more but is one-size fits all and is adjustable as they grow. Just don't put it in the dryer..."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,"We swaddled our baby from day 1 and she slept like an ace, 5 hours at 1 week and 11 hours at 8 weeks. The secret is using these Velcro secured blankets in addition to The Happiest Baby on the Block DVD. The author shows exactly how to swaddle for peak effectiveness. This method saved our sanity!!! The baby feels snug and secure, her arms cannot startle her awake during the night, she's a happy camper and mom and dad are definitely happy campers. This is the most important thing that we owned. It is definitely worth the money. Regular blankets do not work as well because they are not secured. Our baby didn't necessarily like being swaddled up at first, she would fuss, but the resulting great, full night of sleep followed. I wholeheartedly recommend buying the swaddling blankets and The Happiest Baby on the Block DVD."
2,We had problems too...,"I agree with the first reviewer,""Cindy""--I love the concept, but the proportions on this swaddler just aren't right, unless you have a really tiny baby or one that doesn't kick his/her legs much (my one-month old boy weighs 11 lbs and is 23 inches long.). The velcro doesn't hold because the patches are too small, and the knit fabric is too stretchy. However, I put him in the larger size SwaddleMe today, and it fits much better."
4,Pretty good,"This swaddle blanket is pretty good but not awesome. It's gotten easy for my baby to get out of, or get tangled in, now that she is 3 months and can use her arms. I am not sure what to do now since she wiggles out and wakes up. But until now it was a great deal for its price."
3,"Ok, but there are better.","I've used this and other Kiddopotamus products. They're not bad, but never rise to greatness. The Miracle blanket worked much better for keeping our baby tightly swaddled."
3,"Good, but I've had better!","We bought this swaddler, along with the miracle blanket. Even though the miracle blanket is more expensive, we believe it works better and we will be able to use it longer. The Swaddle me cotton swaddler is very small and it does stretch, but our baby will outgrow it quickly. It also is hard to get the swaddle just right, because if you make it super tight, it seems too tight, but otherwise the baby's hands come out of it easily."
5,Couldn't live w/o these!,"I wish I had gotten more of these...I have two so when one gets soiled I immediately start a load of clothes to get it cleaned! My son doesn't like his arms swaddled, but the rest of his body stays close and warm."
2,NOT good for the size it claims,"According to the weight listed on the package, this item should fit a baby 3-6 months of age (14-22 lbs)My son is 13lbs and this does NOT fit him well. I wish I could post a pic to describe it better, but the opening in the front is still open. He wakes himself up by the slightest movement, and I was excited that he may be able to sleep finally without me holding him still, but I have been let down. AS I TYPE, MY SON IS STICKING HIS HANDS RIGHT THROUGH THE FRONT!!! I do LOVE the fabric, and the design, but the weight limit is wrong, this would do best for a NB up to maybe 10lbs.Approval In...Fabric: YES Product Accuracy: NO Ease Of Use: YES Packaging: YES"
2,Beware of size!,"I purchased the ""small"" (7-14 lb.) size for my 10 lb. baby and it was far too small. The fabric was nice, color a bit garish, but we really didn't get to experience this product because it wasn't large enough for our baby.We have used the Halo swaddle sacks, and we like them. Moreover, they're truer to the stated size.Halo:Halo Innovations Newborn 100% Cotton Sleepsack Swaddle, Sage Pin Dot"
4,Works well enough,"My kids were not huge fans of swaddling in general, but for the first month or so when they were really little this worked out well. It kept them warm and happy at night. Wouldn't have done it differently."
3,nice but not for bigger babies,"I love these blankets, so when my baby out grew his I went on here to buy a large. He weight 14 lbs, so I got the large size that claimed to be for 14-19 lbs. It is too small and can't even velcrow :( Not for bigger babies."
2,Easy to kick out of,"Only used this twice as baby managed to kick his legs out of it. Could just be that he had a super strong kick. On the pro side, it was very soft & easy to put on the baby."
1,Keep it tight!,"Make sure its as tight as possible, otherwise the babies head can get inside and the baby could soffocate. The back/side should be totally covered in velcro so that you can stick the tabs where you need them"
5,A Nail-Biting Thriller,"Ryne Douglas Pearson creates a realistic and chilling band of domestic terrorists in this outing for his FBI agent hero Art Jefferson. He also gives them a plausible plan to wreak serious havoc on the U.S. government. Expect fast page turning and nail-biting suspense when you pick up, or download, this title. Jefferson's in a race against time to stop a plot that's almost impossible to detect. To say more would spoil the twists and surprises. If you enjoy action thrillers, you won't be disappointed here."
4,Capitol Punishment,"A study on hate and homegrown terrorism : white supremacists and African Liberation Front's are two sides of the same coin and are the protagonists of this thriller.The plot starts by a 911 call and the quick death of the first responders, followed by the discovery of the bodies of the chemist and his buyer of a nerve agent. Soon, FBI agents Art Jefferson and Frankie Aguirre realize that two more canisters of the gas were made and are somewhere in the hands of terrorists.The story follows the steps of the bad guys and the FBI agents who try to stop them. It is well done but not a really intricate plot. I found most of the characters unidimensional and the motives for their actions either not well explained or too simplistic.Still it is a very enjoyable book, a nice read, with an all too believable plot."
4,Well worth reading,"I read this book after reading a later one in the series - Simple Simon - so I went into it knowing the main character, and wanting to know more about him. The story is very believable, because of the world we live in, and kept me reading even though I should have been in bed! The author did a wonderful job of keeping you guessing, and keeping the tension up. Thanks for making it available on Kindle!"
4,Good Read,This might not have had the nuance or maturity of Grisham or Baldacci but the story is great and the prose is solid. Thanks for the read!
5,The Hawkins Family-Live,"This live recording is one of he best performances that The Hawkins Family has done. Walter Hawkins was one of the greatest gospel song writers of out time along with his brother Edwin. I had the experience of seeing them perform these recording and more at an outdoor concert in the band-shell at Chicago's Grant Park many years ago, and as I and many others stood in the rain watching this talented family sing, I will never forget how spiritually powerful that performance was. Though they had many recordings to hit the top of the charts, this I would count among the best. I highly recommend the purchase of this album."
2,Bad poetry meets quality illustrations,"Illustrations were well done, however the Dr. Seuss wanna-be writing style lacks interest and fluidity. His attempts at the child-like poetry, ala Dr. Seuss with a Tim Burton twist, only prove that writing simple poetry with rhythym isn't as easy as it looks. All is not lost though, it did make a good beverage coaster."
5,The Mystery of He,"Que placer tan grande da el encontrar un tesoro. Eso es lo que siento al leer este bello libro: un gran placer. Una historia que motiva y estimula el alma y la vista. No me deja de imprecionar el estilo tan unico y avanguarda de las imagenes.Esta obra continua la exploracion en diseno, tematica y conceptuos visuales que empezo el autor en su primer libro. Solamente por su contenido grafico, este libro es una obra de arte moderno digno de ser incluido en museos y estudiado en escuelas de arte."
4,nice gift,"This is a very uplifting mix of Christmas music. If you like Celtic music, then you will appreciate the various tunes."
4,Informative....,"This book was very informative and had very interesting theories. You have to remember it is by Freud, so there are a few parts that you may have to read over more than once to get the theory. For the most part I thought it was a very interesting and informative book. A lot of the theories that he talked about were very very briefly noted and I feel that he could have gone into a lot more detail than he did."
4,Love these...,"These knobs are exactly what I wanted, were shipped quickly, and were the best price I'd seen yet. The only issue I ran into was that the screws included weren't long enough for my drawer facings. They work fine on the cabinets though and I just used the existing screws for the drawers. Very happy with my purchase."
3,"They are ""OK""",I was hoping for a more darker oil rubbed like the picture. I got them and they just appear to be dark brass rather than the darker rubbed like I hoped for. I will keep them and order more but I wish they were darker.
4,Fine for a closet,"This was a nice, inexpensive solution to a couple of doors in a closet. Product looks exactly like the picture."
4,"Thoughtful Western, Cowboy in Redemption, Tough/tender Heroine","Luke Short's books are a pleasure: frequently with a man realizing he doesn't relish the shady or unproductive life he's living, and goes to considerable effort to turn himself around; also, his women are real people, not a sunbonnet waiting at the ranch to wlecome him home. This book, originally titled Gunman's Chance, does it well. Also check the well-done movie, with Robert Mitchum, Barbara Bel Geddes, and Walter Brennan."
4,Nice guide to start salmon fishing.,"The book, How to Catch Salmon : Advanced Techniques by Charles White, is a great book to start learning how to fish for salmon. All the techniques seemed modern and feasible. It will make a fine addition to anyone's fishing library."
3,catch salmon,"Charlie's a real old-timer. So's his book. I bought his first salmon book 30 years ago. I still keep it on my boat. The book still offers good advice.Despite ""advanced,"" in its title, nowadays this is a book for beginners. Remember, when Charlie wrote his books, GPS, side-scanning digital depthfinders, radar, ultraviolet lures, downriggers ... were just gadgets of the future.Bonus: Nelson Dewey's great cartoons.30 years later, Nelson drew the cartoons for my book. His drawings are wonderful.Wayne Heinz, author of, How to Catch Salmon, Sturgeon, Lingcod, Rockfish, and Halibut Along the Pacific Coast: Fish On!"
2,Old VHS unreliable,This was a very interesting movie about a British woman helping the Allies in occupied France during WWII. Fascinating story - unfortunately the tape kept pausing in our VCR and we missed quite a bit of the dialogue toward the end. I think the tape had been on the shelf too long. What a shame!
1,Made in China; that says it all!,"Dont' bother with these rotors! They warped after barely 300 miles. I was assured by PowerStop that their products were NOT from China, yet after peeling off a label on the box, it was clearly marked, ""Made in China"". So either these are NOT really from PowerStop, or I was lied to."
2,Horrible Range,"My internal card gets full strength signals, this one barely gets reception even within a room or two's distance. Go with another brand."
1,Horrible Wireless Adapter,"This thing is a nightmare. Cuts out constantly and at random times for no apparent reason. The internet could be working just fine and then randomly, it will stop working and stop detecting any wireless networks in range... only to magically start working again a few hours or days later. It is not the range since it is only about 15 feet away from my router, so I really do not know what the problem is."
5,Works great!,Can't beat the price and it works great. I do PC troubleshooting and it's nice to have an alternate way to connect when the users wireless nic fails or is misconfigured. Nice and small. Very durable.
2,WG111 and TIVO,WG111 V2 is NOT recognized by TIVO. V1 is.Verify with the seller BEFORE you buy.Ilearned the hard way
1,Keeps making and breaking connection,"So I wrote a loooooooooooooong email to my boss, explaining a protocol we were designing to implement, and hit send, and guess what, the Netgear smart wizard was looking for the wireless connection from my router across the room... It couldn't find and make that connection and lost the webpage, and I ended up all fuming over this break in wireless network. I had to write that again as a word ducoment so that I can SAVE it before trusting this stupid USB adapter.So this was just an example of what this thing is doing to me, and it has not happened just once. MANY TIMES has it lost the router, my laptop with in-built wireless adapter does not do this to me. And there's no cure for this stupid disease."
2,N.G. For TIVO,"I agree with other users.... If you read the TIVO recommended wireless network adapters, this adapter will not work in TIVO because AMAZON is going to ship you out V.2. V.2 does not work, and V.1 is not longer made. I suggest you just order the TIVO brand.... that's what I did, after trying numerous others.and YES, I have a brand new unit with the latest software, that's NOT the issue."
1,hard to program,"I have a three computers with wireless adapters and a wireless router, all netgear. I can't get but one computer working on the wireless network and it is a laptop with pmcia wirless card. The others have totally frustrated me. I purchased the recomended devices netgear offered. My main computer won't hookup without a wire with the router and usb devise within a foot of each other. I wish I had gone with linksys, their equipment is easier to program. I bought the netgear because of the (...) offered and ended up not getting the (...) after all. Save yourself some headaches and get another brand."
2,-,"This product gave me no trouble in Windows XP SP1 or SP2. I also got it up and running on Windows 98. However, whenever I try to use it on a Windows 98V1, it will work with everyting except the internet. This is very annoying, and this is the computer we bought it for. The Netgear help desk hasn't helped either."
1,i dont know if it works...,"worked but a weird deal, not sure if my computer was the problem or this thing....i cant say it is bad or good sorry..."
3,Constantly overheats,"I have this wireless adapter, and it works fine... when I am not uploading or downloading a lot of data. However, when I am doing so, it will constantly overheat. Sometimes it overheats within a matter of hours, but sometimes it will overheat within 15-30 minutes. It can be very frustrating to constantly have to unplug it, let it rest (or stick it in the fridge), and then plug it in again. I am currently looking to replace it, which is frustrating because it was comparitively expensive when I bought it."
2,Heat Issues,"As always, a crucial point to look for as a gamer is whether or not a wireless adapter will have heat issues down the line. I had this product for nearly fourteen months, and out of the blue it started getting heat issues, giving me 1.0mbps for hours on end if I was on Warcraft or even surfing the internet. After reinstalling the driver, I had about 36.0mbps to even 11mbps with a perfect signal, clearly indicating that it had heated up, or started working improperly. All my anti-virus scans and my spyware scans came up empty (as they should, since I do them regularly), and I have concluded that this heats up.Simply stated, it heats up quite quickly as other reviewers have said, it is too fat, and that 1.0mbps stuff annoyed me.Buy Linksys or D-Link instead."
1,Turns off frequently! Irritating!,"I ordered this when I got a new Dell desktop and needed to connect with the wireless network in my home. It was easy to set up but that is the end of the good news.This adapter just randomly looses its connection to the network. In the space of one hour, it will loose its connection at least twice, if not three times. Reconnecting is no problem - I just click on Repair and it goes through the motions and connects back right away. I reinstalled it a few times but the same thing happens.This is a very irritating feature, especially when I am using Skype! I have had enough and I am ordering a new adapter from a different manufacturer!"
4,Perfect,Perfect no complains it woulds exactly how id expect it to be working. with my computer. The other sales of the usb was for my MAC not my WINdows.
1,It never worked,"I tested on 2 PCs, a Mac and a Dish receiver and It didn't worked. I dint minded that it was used, as long as it work."
2,Lots of trouble,"The driver should be updated from the web site before doing anything or it will give you very hard time.It is not straight forward to adjust it for WEP Key. Took me about 4 hours troubleshooting, although I have 3 other wireless access points that were much more easier to install with trouble free experience.Regarding connection, I had no problems.Don't buy it if you are not an expert in troubleshooting."
1,Periodic Disconnecting,"I just bought this adapter and got the latest drivers (2.1). It just cant hold a connection no matter how close to the AP. It disconnects every 2-3mins which is extremely annoying trying to transfer files etc.Don't Buy this unless you don't mind periodic disconnections.PS I tried XP SP2 and SP1, don't believe the crap they spin on the website about it being a problem with SP2!"
1,It works... for a while,"Although the software interface wasn't the most sophisticated, the WG111 was easy to install and worked well enough for about six months. Then it started dropping connections to the various networks I'd been using, and now it doesn't connect at all. I've done quite a bit of troubleshooting; apparently, it's fairly common for the WG111 to crap out after several months. Don't buy it."
1,"The good, the bad, and the ugly","The good is the hardware. Neat, tidy, easy to hook up. The bad is the software, which is unreliable at best (not sure whether it's kludgy, or just doesn't work well -- tried with flavours of Windows from 95 through 2000 and XP pro.The ugly is support: it has to be the worst I have ever run into on the 'net, and that's saying an awful lot..."
5,worked quickly out of the box,"and the netgear smart wizard is easy to use and informativeafter finding several other networks in my neighborhood with the wizard, I quickly moved mine to WEP. Worked 1st time easily.No need to be a wireless or network wizard to use effectively. Very please with the product, and the old (lower) price."
3,Great Adapter - Not So Great for TiVo,"This is a TiVo-approved wireless adapter, but note that they only approve Version 1. Good luck finding out what you're buying before ordering it.That said, I got a Version 1 unit and found it worked wonderfully with TiVo. For about three hours. Then, it disconnected and took out the wireless side of my home network. TiVo says it doesn't like using a B/G adapter with a B router. Bogus, say I.The WG111 works beautifully on my laptops.Beware."
1,Stinks,"I bought this product for the conveninece of not having to open my desktop and for the mobility- being able to transfer it from desktop to laptop. Worked great for about 2 months and then it started causing my computer to reboot byself. At first this happened with my desktop- i was convinced my computer was broken- i spent $100 on repairs (I know I got ripped off here). Until I started using it with 2 laptops and the same thing started happening. I took it to another techy who told me that this is a frequent problemt with these usb deviced and that I would have to do something to my ""bio"" - i said screw it- and bought a built in card. I know other people who have the same problem and it could be very costly- when you are in the middle of working on a file and it reboots. Neygear CS sucks too- they outsources and I ended up speking to some girl in India who did not understand my question and just kept reading the same script over and over again- DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Very useful -- no cables to trip over.,"I bought this for an older laptop my kids use for homework. There were several speeds to choose from and I've purposefully selected the slowest (and the cheapest) one. At 54 Mbps it's still fast enough for their homework and occasional internet research. It's very easy to install and comes with a nice configuration panel. It's easy to use and makes the kids laptop that much more portable. They can take their laptop anywhere in the house and do homework, without having to worry about being close to Ethernet ports and cables to trip over. Good value for the price. The product works as designed, I recommend it."
1,Adapter,I could not get this product to work. Tried using the manual and website instructions. Purchase a brand new and that one works fine.
1,Doesn't work and very frustrating,It worked at first but the connection kept dropping. Then every time you try to open the wizard it flashes on the screen for a second and disappears. You can't get the wizard to stay on screen for more than a second so can't change any settings. A total waste of time and money - don't bother with it.
4,Netgear USB wireless connection wg111,"The wg111 wireless connector is a handy little device. We use it to connect a laptop to our wireless router about 35ft away in the next room. The connection is reliable though not terribly fast. The only real downside to the wg111 is that it does run fairly hot, which is likely why its speed is limited. I purchased mine from Amazon after ""testing"" one for a few days from the local box-store retail place. (I got the connector at half the price on Amazon.) I do have to say that the newer box-store model ran much cooler and a little faster. It also came with more current software so after I returned it and installed the one I purchased on Amazon the current software was already installed. It installs fairly easily and the included software to monitor the connection is pretty self-explanatory. If you need a reliable, low cost solution this is it."
1,"its not good, its really worse, why?","Am sorry to say. you don't need a rate, if ask me concerning the rate! its really worse! why? because I order this netgear wg111, but without CD installer, am getting insane to install and i cannot use, when i ask the CD installer, you sent me the SpeedBooster not compatible on Netgear WG111, and I sent it back to you, but my payment you did not sent me back, until now you have my payment, am sorry I cannot trust you, what I experience in your handRodolfo"
1,Doesn't work and merchant won't allow returns,"This product is horrible. We own a Belkin and it works, unlike this wireless adapter. I thought I'd try this one since it's smaller and a bit less money, but it doesn't doesn't pick up any signal from our modem, and the modem is across the hall in the next room. In addition, I bought it from State Street Deals, and they won't let us return it because it's been opened. How else would we find out it doesn't work? Definitely NOT a great product, or merchant. I'd avoid both at any cost."
1,Overheats,This product is quite unreliable. I've had it only 8 days and it gets very hot and can't find the access point (in the next room) and the included software is quite unreliable with XP.
1,Disappointing,"Installation was simple, but this device has not worked consistently well from the outset. Signal is OK but once or twice a week it simply quits working, forcing us to unplug and plug it back into the USB port. We put up with that inconvenience for several months until it quit working altogether. Do yourself a favor and find another product (as we are trying to do now)."
1,Wow! What a piece of junk!,"I just spent hours of frustration trying to get this thing to work reliably. Never got it working correctly. Netgear won't just let you install the drivers and be done with it. No, they force you to install their bloated and buggy configuration software which doesn't play well with Windows XP(apparently). So, after much cursing and hair-pulling, I took it back and exchanged it for a comparable Linksys adapter. Now all is right again in my universe. If you are looking for a USB wireless adapter, do yourself a favor and go back to the search page and type in L-i-n-k-s-y-s."
2,Can't keep a signal,It works sometimes but most the time it can't pick up enough of a signal to work.
1,Don't waste your money!,"Although I am very happy with the other NetGear products I own I have to say that this adapter is a waste of money. It's easy to set up (I'm running Windows 2000) and starts working at first, but after less than a half hour, it flickers out and stops working entirely.I have a NetGear router and laptops using NetGear PCI wireless cards which work well, but this product is a dog. I second one of the earlier reviewers who mentioned how hot the item gets after a short time in use. My guess is that it has a design flaw that causes it to overheat and stop working. They should really go back to the drawing board on this one."
2,Works great at first............,"I was a little skeptical at first about using this device... do to it's incredibly small size. However I quickly fell in love with how easy it was to install on my windows xp machine and the excellent Netgear Smart Wizard that sits in my system tray, making it possible for anyone to quickly get connected to their network. Unfortunately my original skepticism quickly came back to confront me. After using the device for only a few days my connection dropped. I had to unplug the thing and reboot my computer before I was able to get back on my network. I've only had it for about 2 weeks and I've had to unplug it and restart my computer probably 15 times to get it to work again. I never used to have problems in the past with my other wireless usb adapters so I have a good feeling that it's due to this devise. I do notice that it gets very hot if you leave it in your computer for a long time, I'm no engineer but this might be somehow related to its poor performance."
1,Never really did work,"Perhaps I am luckier...my Netgear adapter ""crapped out"" five times in the first two weeks. After reading all these negative reviews, I decided just to take it back while I still could. Netgear support was spotty--some reps really tried. But I had one simply give up and walk away fromt the call!"
4,LOW COST WIRELESS ADAPTER,"tHE NETGEAR WIRELESS ADAPTER WORKS WELL BUT IS SLOW TO BOOT UP, TAKING SOMEWHAT LONGER THAN OTHER TYPES."
1,Horrible with TiVo! Beware!!,"I ordered this item directly from TiVo and my DVR didn't even recognize that it was there! TiVo says that it is compatible, but it is NOT. Order the Linksys or D-Link instead."
3,Cute but Quiet little car,"I bought the Chiming Bell Wagon to add a little ""music"" to the growing railway set I am building with my 18 month old grandson. I was disappointed by the quietness of the bell. I had hoped for a more distinct ringing bell sound as the train moved around the track. If we use one of the battery powered engines the bell is only heard if we lean over the track as the car passes by us. Even so, my grandson loves the little car and often plucks it off the track when it comes near. He holds it up to me and says, ""ding ding"". So even though I would be happier with a louder bell, the toy is accomplishing my ultimate goal, to give my grandson toys he will enjoy and that we can enjoy together."
4,B-movie plot redeemed by A+ visuals,"If you've seen _Scanners_ or _Firestarter_, you can probably guess what happens when shadowy government agencies and telekinetic wunderkinds mix. At times, the story and the dialogue are laughably stupid, but director Brian DePalma's considerable talents bring the quality up a notch. Also, John Cassavetes turns in one wicked performance as an evil government operative. Rivers of gore and DePalma's bold camera moves make this one more disturbing than you'd expect."
2,"Mundane, Bland and Lackluster.","Although it was supposedly well funded, this film feels like it was made for cable television. With so much potential wasted it's a small wonder that this film has been somewhat forgotten in the directors cannon. Based on it's premise alone it shoudn't have been this bad. Boy am i glad that i rented this. To think that i was about to pay 29.99 for the upcoming blue ray...."
2,cover judged better than actual film,Probably the worst film K. Douglas was in..........Really shocked..quite dated and slow ....I dont recommend to anyone with a brain.
4,The perfect movie for a drunken binge,"You already know the plot, so I'll get right to the meat of it. ""The Fury"" is one of the coolest De Palma movies there is. I first saw this movie on TNT when Joe Bob Briggs did a show called Friday night Monstervision. He did drive-in totals, and I'm sure those totals would help you now.This movie has: 23 dead bodies. 1, full-torso body explosion. 1 car wreck with crash and burn. 1 boat wreck with crash and burn. 1 car wreck with bloody civilian casualty. 1 former Playmate turned inside out.Hey, the movie sold me with those and it got better from there. How can you resist a movie where a bad guy has no use in one of his arms. Especially when a character asks what happened to that guy's arm and Kirk Douglas cooly replies, ""I killed it. With a machine gun."" Now that's entertainment."
2,"Mine exploded, too","That's how I ended up... Fury-ous! There are MUCH better early De Palma flix - try Carrie, Obsession or Dressed To Kill - or almost any others for that matter. This seemed like a 2 hour setup for an exploding head."
4,A different approach.,One cannot go wrong with Kirk Douglas. Very different. Intense acting and a unique story line. Very interesting.
3,Weird,"If you want to be entertained by a weird, mind-bending, freakish horror flick that makes very little sense then this is a good film to watch. A waste of acting talent & money."
1,The Fury,"The Fury a Plymouth Fury? More like a dud.Despite the ensemble and having Douglas great portrayal as well Andrew Stevens,the movie was trying to be too many things at once,Think Fire Starter,Carrie and other movies and genres all squeezed together in a nonsense plot.Despite the BANG for the buck at the very end of the movie,it comes up short for me."
1,"It was BOMB In 78', and it's still a BOMB.","Oh, please! Some of these reviewers giving this turkey 4 stars is like saying Andrew Stevens was an acting genius of his time. I saw this flop when it first came out, and I distinctly remember the crowd walking out after saying how bad it was.Time hasn't helped this DePalma mess out either, unless you're into getting in a few laughs at the dialogue, acting and especially terrible effects. Anybody who claims this as anything close to ""Carrie"" needs a serious MRI done, because the closest this flop is to that classic, is the actors (if you consider Amy Irving an actress) and the extra buckets of fake blood. It's also painful watching Kirk Douglas and John Cassavetes reading lines off each other, fully knowing, it's all for the paycheck.Please, if you want to view a decent DePalma flick, pick up ""Dressed To Kill"" of ""Blowout"". Both more superior than this lame duck."
2,chicken,"I wasn't happy with this product It didn't fresh at all I usually get this from a pet store but it's not always easy to get there, so I ordered it on line and was dissapointed not fresh"
4,dried chicken,"The Natural Freeze Dried Chicken Breast looks very appetizing. My cat loves it. It has become the snack of her choice even though sometimes she likes it mixed with some other dry treats. Sometimes some pieces in the bags are a little dark, almost too dry and hard to chew. In general I have luck and it looks excellent even if pricy. I wish the price would be more accessible for other pets to be able to enjoy pure protein not found in any other commercial product."
3,Good but ..,My cats love these but they are VERY expensive. A large portion are always hard and stale no matter how careful I am to not open the bag often and keep it well sealed.
4,My cats love this.,"My cats love this product. The slightest whiff of it causes them to beg with frantic meows. This is a great product if you'd like to train your cat(with a clicker and a pointer). It's a lot of money for 21oz of chicken though, so it loses one star :("
3,Fresh bags of chicken,My cats love this product however the chicken is hard and spikey. Im afraidf that they will choke. I've gotten 3 bags and only used half in each bag. The rest is wasted. I wish that something could be done. The last vendor sent me new bags that were fresh and didn't charge me. Other than that it is a very healthy snack for my cats.
3,good product but it turned so hard to be powdered lately,"I like its freeze dried chicken breast treats and all my more than three cats are crazy about it. The reason that I give only 3 stars is because its freeze dried chicken breast treat is turned into so hard (most recent two 21 oz bag purchase) to be pressed into powder form (I use it as food attraction too) and if I insist to press it, my fingers would get hurt. Everytime, I give it to my more than 3 cats, I worry the possibility of choking by those more than too many hard pieces and even get hurt by some sharp small pieces(I have to threw them away).I have been given this company's products to my cats for more than 3 years. Well, if its chicken treat does not get imprvement (or back to its old form, easy to be pressed) at my next auto delievery, I think I need to find other sources.I either buy its products through amazon.com or dirctly from its website."
5,One of the Boys,"One of the BoysI really enjoyed this cd by Gretchen Wilson. One song in particular stands out and that is 'COME TO BED"" (featuring John Rich), it speaks of never going to bed angry with each other. This cd is varied in subjects and straight to the point as only Gretchen can be. Can be enjoyed by one and all no matter what kind of music you like."
4,She's done it again,"Yes this cd may be different from her first two, but it's honest and straight from the heart which is one of the reasons so many of her fans including myself can relate to."
4,grows on you,This third venture is more understated but more thoughtful than her previous work. I've listened to it several times now and each time I like it better.
2,Good Cd BUT...,"I got this CD using Pepsi Stuff Points. The case was cracked when it arrived but the CD was okay. Good tunes, lowsey delivery service..."
4,Good stuff,"Gretchen Wilson have made a very good album, with this voice and good lyrics she couldn't fail. I have it on my top 15 list of country albums from the later years. This is her best album yet, I hope she keeps them comming. This redneck woman is just great, she knows how to make us listen to her songs.Fan for life."
1,Am I the only one that hated this album?,"Seriously though. As an avid Ozma fan starting in about the year 2000, I remember being excited about Pasadena. But then, I saw them live shortly before it's release and they were awful, AND Pasadena was not great either. Maybe I didn't give it enough of a listen, but when I heard the AWFUL remakes of ""No One Needs to Know"" and ""Eponine""... oi. I'm sure it wasn't their choice to re-record them, but regardless it ruined it for me. Get their other stuff. It's all amazing."
5,ALWAYS ELVIS,THIS CD IS A WINNER.THE SONGS ARE TIMELESS.THIS CD KEPT ELVIS IN THE SPOTLIGHT WHILE IN THE ARMY AND AT THE $5.00 PRICE IT WILL HELP THE LEGACY TO GROW.
4,"2003 Notable Book, Association of Jewish Libraries!",This title was declared a 2003 Notable Book by the Association of Jewish Libraries! Almost 200 children's books of Judaic content were reviewed during the year to find the best of the bunch. Find out more at www.jewishlibraries.org.
4,An exciting look at Elizabeth's courtiers as critics.,"Frye's study of Elizabeth's struggle to control her iconography and representation is very powerful. She discusses three major events in the course of Elizabeth's reign, and how merchants, courtiers and poets represented Elizabeth through them: praising her glory and virtue, yet simultaneously taking the critical liberties of a patriarchal society over a woman.Frye's third chapter on ""Engendered Violence"" is especially revealing, whether or not we can fully accept the extremity of such criticism in the character of Britomart in Spenser's Faerie Queene.This book is wonderful, a necessary read for anyone interested in the force of gender in the Renaissance."
5,Great fights and stuff being thrown.,"AWESOME...That's what this movie is. It's got my favorite Spider-Man villian, Doc Oc, using his arms to beat the crap out of Tobey Maguire.This has the most awesome super hero fight scenes and the best dangling old lady scene I've seen in a while. Not better than the first movie, but not worse, just different. I think there was less fighting in the second, though...I just paid to watch a giant fight, which I wish it would have been. Too much plot. But when there wasn't plot, it picked right back up into cars being thrown...so don't worry pro wrestling-watchers...you'll get your fix."
2,Blu-Ray has none of the DVD extras.,"Does not include any of the amazing behind the scenes content originally released on the DVD. Why would a studio release such an extraordinary FX film with incredible production values on a format that can hold so much information, and fail to include the extras? If you're a fan of behind the scenes content, hold onto your DVDs.Movie - A+. Blu-Ray value for Spider-Man 1&2 - FAIL."
4,Great Quality,Great movie and the action is great. If your a spiderman fan than this movie is worth the price. I would recommand it.
5,Spider Man 2,I ordered this movie along with the first Spider Man for my son to catch up with the series. Great movie and recieved it on time.
1,Pathetic!,"I actually enjoyed this film when I saw it in the theater. Looking back; I must have been on some sort of drugs or something because this movie is horrible. Actually both films are stupid as can be. Shooting web out of your hands? Come on! You can't do that in real life. How about the guy with like 8 arms; like we haven't read this in a comic book somewhere before. I swear these movies are a rip off of an old comic book, but I can't remember what it's called. I have no respect for a movie that steals ideas from a comic book. I think they even used some of the same names. I'm sure the producers are laughing all the way to the bank."
1,Worst Movie I've Seen in a While,"I could tell you all the things I hated about this movie, but there just isn't enough time in ones life for that. I've seen alot of bad movies this year, but this one takes the cake. I'm even tempted to watch Gigli because I can't believe that any movie could be worse than this one. I liked the plot pretty well and at times thought it could be a good movie. Then there is the acting. I know Tobey Maguire is a better actor than this, and Kirsten Dunst put up her usual poor performance. I think Kirsten Dunst peaked as an actor at age 10. She has gotten steadily worse over time, but in this movie she was really really bad."
1,No Mre sequals!,"This movie did not fill it's axpectations, it was horible! I'd like to see the producers come up with another one, how in a million years would peter survive if EVERYONE knows it's him?, He doesn't have to be a perfect gentlemen but taking off his mask to everyone he meets, the whole movie was moronic I would of enjoyed it if that weird gravity thing erased people's memory and, that Auto guy could control his arms after all he wasn't even evil!"
2,Disappointed,"I wanted to see this movie so bad, I took a trip to Boston one weekend to see it at IMAX. Wow, was I disappointed. When did Peter Parker turn into such a crybaby? He cried through the whole movie. I truly LOVED part one, but thought this one was way too melodramatic for a comic book story. And the whole keeping the secret from MJ just got old. Is he going to come out to her or not? Just do it already. Good thing my friend Jay hated it as much as I did.I do know that my opinion is not the popular one. Most of my friends loved it, I just thought it turned Peter Parker into a big cry baby. Boo Hoo already."
2,Lackluster,"I found this film to be somewhat boring. Though I enjoy comic book movie franchises, Spiderman is my least favorite."
4,Superior sequel!!! A big A+++ for Spiderman 2!!,"This movie is a fantastic sequel! The storyline continues where the first Spiderman left off and answers many questions leftover from the first. Peter even confesses it was his bad decision that cost his uncle his life - a very powerful moment. The technological marvels of CGI (Computer Generated Images) is breathtaking! It's amazing how real the scenes were, especially with Doctor Octopus. It was the most ""real feeling"" sci-fi flick I've ever seen. All characters were nicely represented and the plight of Spiderman was nicely filmed.I can't wait for Spiderman 3!"
1,Never ending story II,"I found that all the action in the movie you can see on the preview of it. The story is slow; the drama makes you wish to slop Peter. The effects save if of flying though the window. To match attention to the special effects, not to the story. That made it not enjoyable. It sucks"
1,awfully boring,"I found myself repeatedly wanting to leave the theatre, at times the suspense was so sophmoric, I truly thought how unengaging the conflicts were. An avid comic follower for years, this truly made me want to cringe."
4,Underlying Message,"At first glance, this might seem to be an entertaining and suspenseful action flick, complete with big name Hollywood stars, fantastic special effects, and a plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat. However, if you delve deeper, you might find a darker underlying message. What is that message? That is something you are going to have to ask yourself, as you wrestle with the demons of your conscience."
5,Doc Ocks finally here!!!!,"At last Spider-man 2 is on its way.I'm a huge Spider-man fan and while I enjoyed the 1st one I couldnt help but wish it was Doc Ock I was looking at on the screen and not the Green Goblin.Doc Ock is my favourite bad guy and now he's finally coming with all his tentacled terror.Alfred Molina(Doc Ock)looks great in the role and his tentacles look meaner than ever. Tobey Maguire,Kirsten Dunst and the rest of the cast from Spider-man 1 return with all larger roles to play,particularly Harry who forms some sort of alliance with the deadly Doc and some point in the movie to get revenge on Spider-man for whom he blames for his fathers death.Spider-man 2 looks like it surpasses its predecessor in every aspect.I cant wait to see it."
1,Idenity revealed too many times,"This movie did not fill it's axpectations, it was horible! I'd like to see the producers come up with another one, how in a million years would peter survive if EVERYONE knows it's him?, He doesn't have to be a perfect gentlemen but taking off his mask to everyone he meets, the whole movie was moronic I would of enjoyed it if that weird gravity thing erased people's memory and, that Auto guy could control his arms after all he wasn't even evil!"
1,pitiful,"I was shocked at how poor this movie was. The first one was very good, a little cheesy...this one was absolutely horrible and extremely cheesy. If you haven't seen this tur#$@@l yet I'd seriously take a pass on this one."
1,Not impressed!!!,"My wife and I finally saw this movie. She was very anxious to watch this movie, especially since she love the first one and I thought the first one was good.After watching, we both agreed that it was slow, boring and pointless. Personally I didn't care for the love story and the villian didn't have enough to do. I cant really write about it since there wasn't much to it.Gripe: Being born & raised in New York, why was there an elevated train in Manhattan? They should at least get that right."
1,I think they are wrong?,Question how can this be a new extended dvd if the old one is 128 mins? this one is 127 mins.
1,Worst movie ever,I have never been so disgusted with a movie in my entire life. The dialogue was worse than Showgirls. No real person would say or do half the things these characters do. If you like this movie you are a moron.
5,Nothing Short of Amazing,"This film is not only the best super-hero movie ever made, but it is easily the best summer blockbuster ever. It evokes every kind of human emotion. The character development is so deep that when Peter Parker is hurt you almost feel as though your best friend is hurt. Now dont get me wrong. Just because i said the character development is deep does not mean that there is a lack of action here. The action is amazing. The special effects are quite literally breath-taking. This movie has earned a spot as one of my all-time favorite movies ever. I love this movie and i dont see how anyone can say anything bad about it. It is simply incredible."
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Coupling a dead fish of a romance with a complete anti-climax of a superhero movie, Spider-man 2 fails in almost every conceivable way; put it this way, it's never a good sign when your villain is five times more likable and sympathetic as your superhero."
3,Not as good as the first.,"I wish that they would/could carry the movie on one villain and not a montage. I think that if they would move like in the comic they might have a better product on the back end and not just to cash in. Set teasers. Should someone peaking from around the corner or view a monitor and making cryptic comments. Where is Carlton Fisk. Where is the Shocker, Vulture. There are many villains that Spiderman fought that weren't super famous but they could have been with some corrective/creative brainstorming in the movies. The CGI was good and appropriate where it was applied. So it's good for the entertainment value but not as a blockbuster."
3,Spider-Man II is a safe family film that stays fairly....,"...true to the comic series. Peter Parker is still a bit whiny in this film as he continues to battle his own identity as well as super villian Doctor Octopus (the real star of the film). The dvd is jam-packed and well worth the money. I just hope we get a bit less sap in Spider-Man III and Peter Parker can start acting like a confident young man soon. Still not sure how Spider-Man can pick up a car, but an brutal uppercut to Doc Ock's chin just stuns him instead of removing his head....Superhero physics I guess."
3,Just OK Sequel,"This sequel is quite uneven, alternating scenes of high energy and powerful emotion with scenes containing trite dialogue and silly stuff (the ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"" scene was SO bad!). Still, it's worth watching, and the special effects associated with the Doctor Octopus character are super."
3,3 & a half.,"I had nothing better to do and I didnt think Spiderman 2 would be the bordem releaver. I did not like the 1st one and I had no intentions on watching this one. But my old man likes them and my girfriend told me it was ok, so I threw it on in hopes it would put me to sleep. Within the first few minutes I thought the CGI looks as bad as the 1st film. But I soon realised this one didnt take itself too seriosly. I laughed at the situation when Spiderman becomes web-impodent and has to to catch an elevator to get down from the building, and it sparks the point, what would it be like to ride the elevator with one of these guys?The humour was ok, the story wasnt bad, I thought the octopuss guy looked stupid, but an interesting concept. I thought it was ok, not one i'd want to own, but worth seeing at least once."
3,Disappointed,"After hearing everyone rave about how much better this movie was than the first one I was very excited to go see it. I loved the first movie. Spiderman has always been one of my favorite comic book heroes and the first movie was, while not true to the ""T"" for the comic book, an excellent rendition.I was extremely disappointed, aside from the humor and Peter and his aunt and the new character of Dr. Octavius, everything in this movie was miserable. The only reason people are saying this is better than the first is due to the better special effects and action scenes. The plot is almost non-existent, the character development is weak...these were the best things about the first movie. The main characters of MJ and Harry were watered down and made almost laughable. It wouldn't bother me if neither of them were seen again.Now there will be a third movie, but I'm afraid I won't be there to see it. My time and money are too important to be wasted on such dribble."
4,Good special effects and fair story,"Spiderman 2 contains a lot of action and excellent special effects. The movie starts off where the first one left off: Spiderman is at the peak of his superhero status, and as with any peak, there is a fall in store. Spiderman gets fired; he is delayed in paying rent; and he's not doing that well in school; his love, MJ, thinks he's a flake. Well, he has a job to do. The choice is his -- continue to be Spiderman, or live the life of a regular guy? Initially, he chooses the regular guy status, but falls short. He later learns that his role is to be a superhero, which means sacrificing certain things that others take for granted, such as falling in love and marrying the girl of one's choice."
2,Disappointing,"The first Spiderman was entertaining. It did what it was supposed to do, which was give every comic book loving man and woman a decent action flick. The new Spiderman however has lost something. The directing is shoddy at best. The script is awful. There are just too many awful lines. ""... you're just an empty seat..."" ""I've always been standing in your doorway."" Spiderman is supposed to have a serious side, but the script was total garbage. The actors did a good job with what was given to them, but the story just could not hold up the foundations. Overall a disappointing movie."
3,Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition),"I was rather disappointed with this film. I thought the story was unimpressive and, whilst the special effects were good here and there, the film drags on alot and is just plain boring. When one purchases a film like this, one hopes to view it again and again. I saw it once. And that is enough. I doubt I will watch it again. I regret buying it. Anyone one to purchace a used copy from me?David PearlmanCyprus"
2,A bit of a letdown,"I guess I am in the minority. I thought the film was entertaining but I certainly don't think it deserves all the hoopla that's been going around. Visually, it didn't offer anything that was new. The plot was very different from the first but what I liked about the first one was the character development.....getting to know who these people are. In Spider 2, it seemed that there were so many maudlin moments that were unnecessary. Constantly telling the audience that things are bad. Alrgiht. I got the point. Move on. I thought the acting was very forced also. Too many tears for a comic book character. In fact, every character had some tears to shed at various points, even the bad guys, the supporting actors and the EXTRAS!!! C'mon. This is NOT heavy drama and could NEVER be construed as such so why throw it in so many times?"
4,Great movie!,I thought it was a great movie. Personally i think it's the best out of the three out today.
4,"Though still a comic-book adaption, SP2 is still pretty good","Let's give high praise to Sam Raimi and his great crew for not churning out another comic-book dud like Hellboy and last year's the Hulk were. Lets also praise him for making a sequel that is a true triumph over the original. Spider-Man 2 is a terrific film. Yes it was good, and the reason I gave it only 4 stars was because the end battle scene was a bit too campy and invoked too much science-fiction fantasy. The rest, however, was excellent. The drama and script were much better, the acting was much better, the romance between Peter and MJ was both quirkier and more complex at the same time, and the early action scenes between Doc Ock and Spidey far surpass the action sequences of the first film. In this film, the drama is just as prominent as the battles, and believe me, the battles are very cool and well done. Hollywood may just be wising up on what factors strengthen the quality of sequels."
4,go spidy,"A good touch-up from the first spider man which i thought was good but spiderman 2 is a deffinant improvement from the original spiderman in all areas, it is obvious the graphics have been touched up, more stunts have been added and a much better storyline eg. doesn't just cut straight to the chase it shows a better lead up. Not being a big fan of marvel myself shows me how good it is and i would think that the fans of the marvel comics would greatly enjoy this. More action has been added and i think that doc. oc is a far cooler super villain than the original one which i hope does not return in the third part to the series( you'll know what I meen after watching the movie). Gets a deffinant thumbs up a must see for you marvel fans enjoy."
2,Have not show this one,Arrived on time and it was a great price and I will take a look at it in the future
5,spider-man 2 full screen specia edition,it was all great it was like new went i got it and more like he said about it i will buy from him again i give on this a great 100% and more ty cw
1,It's really bad ignore the reviewers on here!,Stay away from this film it's horrible after I read the reviews when they said it was better than the first one well I saw it and it sucked just like the first one did. The cast looked like they were about to fall asleep when they were making the film and it also looked like they were getting tired of doing of the series. Why in the hell do they make the trailers look so cool then I see it and I get a total rip off of good money? It sucks but anyways be smart and do not see this film it's dumb.
3,spiderman2,this movie is better than the first one more action in it and a little bit of a chich flick to.a must see that wont bore the average male.
1,Marketing really does work.,"I can understand just wanting to watch a trashy action film but this movie was just annoying. Tobey Maguire did his best to convince us that he really is a wet noodle. His snivelling self-conflicted, let-me-show-you-my-feminine-side routine was a bit overplayed. For a minute I thought that it was the exact character that he played in Cider House. Somehow I couldn't help imagining Roger Ebert with a toothy grin, ramming popcorn in his mush while fawning over Maguire's touching portrayal of a superhero in conflict. Seriously, this was a casting disaster that the marketing department saved. A few reviews ago somebody mentioned ""not seeing enough of maquire's body."" Was that a joke? After seeing him in this film I am ready to concede that there is a place for steroid use in this world. Reading these reviews I'm suspecting that the production company is paying people to write reviews on amazon."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzz.......boring!!!!,"i cold not wait for this to come out. i saw it opening day and almost fell asleep like 6,000 times. what do you think of when you hear the word spiderman.......i think of comic books, bad guys getting the crap kicked out of them, and all sorts of action.NOT A GAY LOVE STORY!!! yes peter parker loves mary jane blah blah blah but it shouldnt of been the whole movie. if you havent seen this yet, get ready for about an hour and a half of talking and the rest action.dr.occ wasnt even really a villian,i just couldnt get myself to hate his character.so this movie gets a 2 only for the action, the rest of the movie i give a -5. dont waste your money unless you wanna take a nap."
1,smallville anyone?,"I must admit the sequel is bucketloads better than the first. That said, the rest sucks. Spiderman is a total copy cat of Superman and Smallville. The villians and the characters are total ripoffs. Money wasted. Do yourself a favor and watch a better movie. Make it Superman."
4,One huge reason to be optimistic,"I actually thought the first Spiderman movie was fairly boring, and for the same reason that most super hero movies are boring: a very bad script. I honestly don't know if the second one will be any better, but there is hope! After the phenomenal critical success of the book THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY, which tells the story of two young comic book writers from the early days of WW II, Michael Chabon was asked to write the story for Spiderman II. If you have read that novel, you know what extraordinary ideas he has for comic book stories. There is a very, very good chance that he can elevate SPIDERMAN II to a good space. I actually read an interview with Toby McGuire where he talked about how good he thought the script was.So, keep your hopes up folks! Thanks to Michael Chabon, the second film just might be a very good one."
3,not the most enthusiastic review,"this was a half hearted effort(IMHO).i felt no connection to this spidy or any charactor.everyone seemed to be going through the motions waiting for some special effect to take place.i rated this(im going to get BOOED for sure now)on the level as the hulk.to be honest,the hulk had better effects and if you give it a 2nd shot,a better told story.im not holding the originals greatness over this one.its just not a very good movie.not aweful,but not great either.i really wished they would either made octopus meaner or stuck with plan A,the vulture.the vulture had no nice streak to corrupt.sandman or electro would make a nice super villians in the next one.i truly dont see why so many are heeping such praise on this?!?!?"
4,Film really has heart,"I thoroughly found this movie to be genuinely warm and appealing. It has real story and it is not too negative. Save for when Parker undisguised doesn't help the guy getting mugged. How about just calling for the police, Peter? I found the villain to have just enough scren time, anymore would have been sickening. A good movie through and through with the above exception. I enjoyed the bloopers on the DVD too. Watch them after you see the completed work though."
4,Great movie but that's not the point.,"Great movie. Period. But that's not the point. Once again, Musical genius ""jeremy"" is wrong again. THOSE VILLAINS ARE NOT FROM THE SPIDERMAN MOVIES. THOSE VILLAINS ARE FROM THE ""BATMAN MOVIES."" Go watch them, idiot. You are probably a music genius, but YOU ARE NO MOVIE GENIUS. And, on your about you page, if you say you're so smart, how come YOU CAN'T SPELL HARVARD CORRECTLY?"
5,A KICK-ASS SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER!,This movie was by far the best movie out this year!!! It was a great movie from beginning untill end. You could not have found better actors for the parts in this movie. Tobey Maquire and Kirsten Dunst make the movie so much more gripping and exciting. It was perfectly written and had such a better plot outline than the first movie. This film has definatley won my vote and you can bet I will be buying it the day it comes out!!!
2,"wooohoooo, 8 mins! B.F.D","Wow, only 8 mins. of addition scenes. Want to impress me? have the movie atleast show 30+ mins of unseen footage. ill probly buy this to see what its like, but ill buy it used where its cheaper and i can get rid of it if it doesnt impress me enough. Spider-man 3 sneak peek would interested me, a month earlier but i seen enough pictures of spidey 3 to make me excited already. One more thing sam raimi could do for us spidey fans, ask Disney to release the 90's animated series."
1,Don't listen to the other reviewers it sucked!,"I did not like Spiderman 2 at all (...)! It was like watching a soap opera movie or something with no action in it. All there is, is just graphics there's not any fighting in it. Doc Ock wasn't a villian at all he was just tryin to go after Spiderman for what he did to him and all. I don't really see Tobey Maguire as Spiderman that much he just wasn't right at all. Kirsten Dunst was allright as MJ and she's georgeous. I wouldn't mind having a girl like that. James Franco would have been a better Spiderman than Tobey Maguire. Why did they had to choose Tobey? I hate Tobey Maguire and all of his movies they suck and he's also boring who never says a word. But anyways don't waste your money on this movie it's very bad. That goes along with the first Spiderman. Both Spiderman movies suck!"
3,"what was that, sam raimi ?","Spider-Man 1 - 1.85:1 (35mm)Spider-Man 2 - 2.40:1 (super35mm)To be honest, i don't like carnivals of aspect ratios in my collections, so i'm going to skip any other comment about that fact.i think the special-effects percentage was equal to the first one. Of course, special effects are a lot better, but, i don't know, it makes me think about those 200 million dollars spended in this movie, it was a total robbery.The fulls-creen version wasn't made from the original widescreen version, they took the super35mm shots. kind of sad huh ?did i missed something in the theatrical version ?2 hrs of my life that i'll never get back."
1,What?,Is this a game or what? Neither was black cat or shocker in Spider-Man 2. Is this a cartoon then? I am confused
4,Spidey 2 Rules!,"Great action flick with a decent love story. Liked it even more than the first one, and that one was very good. If there is to be a Spiderman 3, it will have to be spectacular. This one will be a ""hard act to follow"". One of the best of its genre. 4 solid stars."
3,Slightly better than the first,"While definitely improved, its really not that much more enjoyable than the first. The only difference is, I actually liked Peter Parker in this, though his whininess was constantly grating. Kirsten Dunst was annoying, just like in the first one. The effects are better. The plot is barely improved over the first movie. It was decent, but still not good enough."
5,SPIDERMAN 1 and 2 DVD,I bought these (2) during the Black Friday Specials for $3.99 each as a Gift. The DVD's are packaged safely and shipment was prompt. I highly recommend DVD purchases from Amazon.
4,Once again great film,"My only complaint with this film is I think it could have been shorter, but 2 hours and 4 minutes isn't too bad.This movie does a good job of staying on theme with the first in the series and moving the story ahead. If you liked the first you have probobly seen this one as well."
5,A lot better than first!,I saw it the other day on HBO. It was my first time watching it and I was amazed by the special effects and CGI. I didn't like the first one very much because the dialogue was too corny and it had crappy special effects it looked all fake. This one seems to be more serious than the first. It has lots of action and better acting than the first. Everyone did a great job and I think you would like it. It's worth buying on DVD! I can't wait for Spiderman 3 when it comes out it's going to be great!
5,Good movie for family,In todays world of gore and terrable movies that children cannot watch this is a very good one for the whole family. The graffics were great and this movie actually had a good story line. The train scene was great.
4,Great Movie...Bad Ending,"Let me explain the ""bad ending"" part. (Without spoling things.) Spider-Man fights Doc Ock three times in the movie. First, they fought in the bank which leads to fighting on the clock. Second, they fought on the train. (Which is one of the best action sequences EVER!) Lastly, there was a fight scene at the end of the movie...WHICH LASTED ALL OF 5 SECONDS! Instead of having a kick-butt final battle sequence...they use up all of the action throughout the film & probably 4 punches are thrown at the end. I was expecting more from the ending. Other than that, the movie was flawless, gripping, & awsome. I can't wait 'til Spider-Man 3. (And hopefully IT will have a better ending.)"
4,EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE!!!,"GREAT ACTING!!! GREAT CHARACTER DRIVEN STORY--THE WAY ALL MARVEL COMIC BOOKS USED TO BE!!! GREAT ENDING!!!(...)TOBEY MAGUIRE HAS GOTTEN BETTER!!! KIRSTEN DUNST HAS GOTTEN BETTER!!! J K SIMMONS IS UNBELIEVABLE AS J JONAH JAMESON, AND SPIDER-MAN NEWCOMER ALFRED MOLINA IS TERRIFIC AS DR. OCTOPUS!!!GREAT ACTION, GREAT DIRECTING, GREAT MUSIC AND SPECIAL EFFECTS!!!HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT SPIDER-MAN 2 IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE!!!CHARI KRISHNAN RESEARCHKING"
5,Better than the first.,"This movie was very good. It was better than the 1st. I saw it July 3rd, and loved it.It was funnier and more creative. Spiderman got tired of getting bad mouthed and actually quit, but soon relized his movie nemisis ""Doc Occ"" was out to get and destroy the world, so Spiderman was back. Great movie, Go See It!"
5,BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR,"I am not a huge spider man fan. I moderately enjoyed the first one, but I was absolutely blown away by this film. I loved every second of it. The action, the characters, the relationship between MJ and Peter, all of it. The acting was awesome, I can't imagine how it would have turned out if they had replaced Maguire. The tention between the different characters was brilliant, and it made the action all the more moving. My eyes welled up during some of the action scenes, which were so spectacular. You really feel what is at stake with each punch and special effect. Dunst also has grown on me. She used to come across as kind of self-concious, but she really proved herself in this one. What a wonderful combo the two of them make. Anyway, this is hands down the best movie of the summer, probably the year. GO SEE IT NOW. It's spectacular."
2,Awful - Nearly Painful,"I liked the first movie. It was generally Hollywood fluff, but was interesting enough that I could suspend my disbelief to the point I found it enjoying. An acquaintance of mine recently raved about the sequel and between that and the reviews here I was very anxious to see it when my colleague mentioned she had just bought it. Imagine my surprise when I caught myself watching the clock, rolling my eyes and eventually contemplating shutting off the machine during several points in the film.Kirsten Dunst lost whatever acting ability she had shortly after Interview with a Vampire. She doesn't seem to have the range or depth to portray the complexities of the relationship between M.J. and Parker. Macguire, I guess, plays a sadsack to a tee - but I don't think I've ever seen him play anything else.The one redeeming part of the entire movie is the fight scenes, while completely unbelievable - the effects are flawless."
1,Totally over-rated,"I found this to be a really silly film, though the main acting was actually well done. The so-called plot was painful by the end. If I hadn't been with other people I'd have left. Best for boys who read comics. Don't expect it to be sustainable for thinking adults."
1,Scrooge Hates It!!!,"This movie is horrible, I am glad I didn't waste money to see it in the Theaters, but am very upset I wasted money buying this piece of crap movie. A half hour into the movie I almost took the DVD out and smashed it into a million pieces. This movie ranks right up there with Batman and Robin as one of the worst ever, with some of the worst actors. Toby CRAPguire IS THE WORST ACTOR EVER!!! Do not buy this movie."
1,Shaft Job on the Consumers,"I love hearing a voice or two pop up to defend this general SHAFT job on the consumers. It smacks so much of studio plant. How about the ""you don't have to buy it"" guy? You know what? More and more, we aren't. Or as another reviewer pointed out, BUY USED. As far as I know, the studios pulling these SHAFT jobs won't profit if you wait and buy second hand. Aside from calling this tactic of continual reissue by its proper name, hurt them where it hurts most, and never buy new."
1,I wanted to like it I really did!,"As I saw in the previews it looked a lot better than the first one but when I rented it the other day it was just awfully slow. I fell asleep during the middle of the movie. There was no action in it till the ending. The acting was bad, the story was just about of how much Peter Parker's life sucks and he tries to get MJ, and the special effects were awful. I don't know why so many people enjoy it a lot. Sorry Spiderman fans don't get mad at me I just didn't like the movie much. The first one was better. The 2nd one just had a bad story. I felt so sorry for Doc Ock too. It was just the worst superhero movie I've ever seen."
2,Spider Man 2 DVD,"I have no idea how the video went since just out of the box the dvd was unplayable due to a glitch in the DVD itself. I give it a 2 only because I figure if you rate it a 1 it won't be accepted. Oh yes, the price was good."
4,Sony's Superbit version will make the difference,"Imagine having a magnifiying glass on each scene. Then be able to make the quality of every special effect, glary scene, or annoying darkness, clear and in the almost same view that was in front of the camera during filming. SONY is going beyond DVD, into a new realm of home-theater SDVD or Superbit DVD."
2,Spiderman 2,"Not a very good movie. The story is slow choppy, and hard to follow. It is no way as good as the first one.My lady movie critic and I give i two thumbs down."
5,The Amazing Spider-Man,"The wait will soon be over. The return of Spider-Man looks to be even more impressive than the original blockbuster. As good as the first Spidey movie was, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN will no doubt bring the fans out in droves, and ensure the growing popularity of Tobey Maguire. With the tone looking darker and one of the greatest comic book villains Dr Octopus finally gracing the screen, this will surely be one of the biggest films of 2004. The countdown begins..."
1,"Peter Parker sucks, Spidey rules","Make no mistake, I like this movie more than I hate it.I like it because it is good story telling, emotional and educational. The special effects are while still with faults really kick ass.I hate it because this movie is about Peter Parker not Spidey. I know Peter Parker and Spidey are the same thing or are they? I know in the comics they tell peter parker more than spidey and that's part of the reason I don't realy like spidey comics. Why do they call it ""spiderman"" and tell stories about his alter-ego peter parker? and here superhero movies are supposed to be about superheroes, and the alter-ego in this case peter parker should be supporting ""actor"". I don't want to see peter parker's problem, I want to see spidey's problems, do you not agree? I wanna see more spidey instead of peter parker don't you?"
1,Where to begin...it was all bad!,"I really enjoyed the first Spiderman movie and was anticipating the sequel and then had the unfortunate opportunity to actually see it. The story seemed to be written by a 4th grader, the cinematography was so choppy, the characters so poorly developed - and the acting was beyond weak. I actually liked Tobey Maguire being selected and thought he was a good fit in the first movie but in the sequel he seemed so pathetic. When the movie began, I jokingly said to my husband that apparantly Spiderman meets his demise by suicide since his life is such crap. There were so many sub plots that never went anywhere - the annoying friend, the annoying landlord, the annoying landlord's daughter, Aunt Mae moving out - where is a good edit when you need it? Overall I think this movie is almost comical it is so bad. Please don't waste your money or time on this movie."
5,Spider-Man 2,"I like this better then the first one. I saw the first movie. It's ok. Now I saw this movie, more action, fights, love."
4,This film is surprising...,"Terrifically charged and different than its predecessor, Spider-Man 2 is a must for lovers of the comic book and anyone who enjoys emotional and enriching storytelling. The special effects can either wow you or make you smell cheese, but that isn't important here. This time out, we get a level of emotion unlike anything seen on the screen in the past year and a line-up of incredible action sequences. MaGuire and Dunst are great young actors who need their proper credit. Anyone who misses this summer blockbuster should be jealous--it is truly a good film, even if you aren't into fantasy, with laughs, sadness, and action movie fun and intensity all balanced out by a sweet romantic subplot that is nearly THE plot. Now, I am actually hoping for a great sequel!!!"
5,Awesome movie,"I'm a loyal spider-man fan and I really loved both of these movies. This one had incredible special effects. The acting was at it's best and the story-line is very well done. Just enough action, just enough drama. No superhero movie could ever top Spider-man 1&2.(except maybe the third spider-man movie) If you get a chance do check this movie out. I know I wasn't into superhero flicks but when I saw the first spider-man movie I was completely blown away, and I'm sure once you see it you'll be blown away too. It will feel like your reading the comics again!!!"
5,Possibly the best superhero movie so far,"""Spider-Man 2"" is a great action movie, one which rises above the usual superhero movie. The acting, the dialog and the camera angles were all great, something that cannot be said for most movies of similar background. The ONLY flaw I found with this movie was with Spider-Man's inability to keep his mask on during the second half of the picture. At one point, I thought everyone in New York would get to see Peter Parker's face in the Spidey suit. Other than that, what more can a viewer say but, ""Bring on the next sequel!"""
5,"""Go Get 'Em Tiger""","Having never read the comic book, I was not drawn to the Spider-Man movies until I heard friends raving about them and now that I have watched both of them on successive nights, I'm afraid I am hooked. I enjoyed them both immensley, but agree that Spidey 2 had more meat on it's bones and a resolution of some aspects of the story that were welcome. Digitalization done well has to be seen to be believed and the special effects in these movies are highly entertaining and a bit breathtaking. The making of Spidey Three will be a challenge, but I suspect those in charge will be up to it. Until then, these movies are stepping stones to more adventures and having that to look forward to isn't all bad."
4,HIGH-OCTANE THRILLER WITH A HEART: SUMPTUOUS!,"As close to perfect as a sequel can be, SM2 covers all its bases with an effortless mix of moods.One minute, some mind-blowing FX are turning your knuckles white with heart-thumping application of digital dolby, then suddenly you see that thrill casually offset by some cheeky humor or some humane spotlight on relationships. None of which ends up too sappy.Barring a stray cheesy moment or two that sneaked in (e.g., the final 5 minutes that slyly burrow a small hole to fit a Part 3 in), I don't have enough praise for this absolutely dazzling summer spectacular for your entire family! A must-watch and when it's out on DVD, a must-own."
5,Spiderman 2,Peter Parker proves all too well that he has a lot of human DNA mixed in with his spider powers. This is an excellent plot line that shows us the fraility of humans and our desire to be someone we're not. I highly recommend this DVD and the extras loaded on it.
4,Excellent movie...better than the original,"I saw it last night, for the first time. This movie is significantly better than the original. You get a much greater understanding of the struggles faced by the different characters. I loved the theme of ""responsibility"" and how it is highlighted throughout the movie. One particularily strong moment was immediately after the train rescue, when the crowd carried the injured Spider Man to safety. The concept that each of us are given certain gifts (strength, intelligence, agility, etc...) by our creator and we are obligated to use those gifts for the benefit of mankind is driven home by several of the characters, including the bad guy...DocOck.Buy this one."
5,Must have,"This is a must have for any Spider-Man fan. There are great new scenes that weren't shown in the theatrical version, especially the one with J. Jonah Jameson...GOOD SCENE! So, if you're skeptical about getting this...trust me, it's worth the $13."
4,2.1 IS BETTER FOR THE PRICE,8 MINUTES MAY NOT SOUND LIKE A WHOLE LOT BUT THE FILM NOW SEEMS MORE COMPLETE. THE ORIGINAL ALWAYS FELT A LITTLE CHOPPY. NOW IF THEY WOULD DO THE SAME FOR SPIDERMAN 1. MORE GREEN GOBLIN VS. SPIDEY WITH NEW CG WOULD BE AWSOME. SPIDER-MAN 2 MIGHT BE THE GREATEST SUPERHERO MOVIE OF ALL TIME (NEXT TO SUPERMAN) BUT 2.1 MAKES IT EVEN BETTER. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5 IS THE LACT OF THE ORIGINAL CUT. SOME OF THE FOOTAGE IS DIFFERENT AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE BOTH IN ONE PACKAGE LIKE THE NEW FF4 COMING OUT. I STRONGLY ADVISE PICKING IT UP IF YOU LOVE SUPERHERO FLICKS LIKE ME.
5,Spider-Man 2 Surpasses the Greatness of the First,"Spider-Man was always my favorite super hero growing up. And I was not the once bit disappointed with the first movie. But this awesome sequel blew the first one out of the water, and I loved the first one. There is just as much action, with more story revolving around Peter Parker as a person, a person with real feelings and real problems. Despite the fact that he has a strong, powerful alter ego, this movie shows Parker for what he really is... a normal down to earth guy trying to get by with everyday problems like the rest of us. This movie honestly is my favorite of the year, and one of my favorites ever."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This is an absolutely horrible movie. My kids love spiderman and walked away from the theatre saying ""it was bad"", just as I did.The whole theatre was obviously disappointed with all the yawns and talking about everything but the movie during the movie. I seen kids wiggling/watching their fingers and being more entertained than watching the movie!"
2,Not that Good,The first Spiderman was way better than this garbage. the acting was horrible and the action scenes... well there were hardly any action scenes. This movie sucked there was way too much talking. Doc Oc was horrible he wasn't even mean. don't waste your money.
3,Could have been great,"This could have been a great movie. The acting, the special effects, and the story, all are very good. However, the constant emphasis on self-sacrifice ruined it for me.Peter Parker never had to ""sacrifice"" himself to be Spiderman. He assumed the role because that was what he was great at. Pride and a sense of achievement, not self-acrifice, is what motivates him."
2,Fullscreen is unfortunate,"Unfortunately, I was given the fullscreen version...what a disappointment! Buy the widescreen if you can."
4,"good, but the first was better","Spiderman was good, but I liked the first spiderman movie a lot more. This one was too much of Peter Parker not having his powers, and doing stupid stuff. For example, why did he keep on taking off his mask. The time on the train was understandable because spiderman could not see, but the rest of the times were just stupid choices for people to know spidermans identity. Also, why did spiderman keep on losing his powers. Shouldn't he still have his powers even if he didn't want to be spiderman. When Peter parker got bit by the spider in the first place, he didn't want powers, but he had them anyway. Now why is he losing them?The first one was better, but see this one anyway."
3,"it was ok, but i dont get the hype","I thought this movie was as slow as the first one. Too much filler. Kids dont want to see spidermans financial and relationship problems, they want to see him"
3,To see or not to see? Hmm....,"Hey, Im 14 and of course Spider-Man is my favortie comic book hero (along with batman). I saw Spider-Man 2 on July 2nd and was completly strested about it. We had to get there 2 hoursd before the movie, wait in a mile long line for tickets, and a 2 mile long line for the movies seating. I sat down and the credits started. They are beautify drawings of the most famous secens from Spider-Man 1. The movie was okay for special effects, iffy for plot, and horrible for length. The film is less than and a half hours, when it could be 1hr. 45 min.s at the most! There was so much talking, The ending was amazing though! WARNING!! SPOLIER AHAEAD!! Harry finds the room where his father kept his costume and bombs. I loved that part and the fight scenes are amazing. I was hoping harry woud'nt find them because I was hoping for venum and/or carnage to be the third and final Spider-man movie. Looks like hobgoblin in summer 2006!"
4,He's Back and Better Than Ever,"Good ol' Spidy is back to pick up right where he left off. This movie is by the far the best superhero movie made. In this sequal Peter finds himself with many challenges. Can Spider Man keep his identity a secret or will he tell the person he loves so he could be with them? To top it off he still has to stop the new villian from destroying movie. This movie as it all; The action is great, the romance with Mary Jane is rising, and Harry's hatred for fathers killer is immeasurable. After seeing the ending of Spider Man 2 it makes Spider Man 3 the most awaited movie in history!"
4,Not up to the Reviews,"One of the highest review movies by the experts. I frankly don't believe it was quite as good as the original. Yes, the special effects are better and the love story angle is still very intriguing. But at points the movie slowed as they did so much set up on re-establishing the love story line and Spidey's attempt to forgo his career.Don't get me wrong. I really liked the movie and recommend it strongly. But the first was just as good or better. They do end with a great lead-in for the next. And yes, I can't wait."
5,Spider-Man 2 DVD,"Excellent DVD! It definitely kept me engrossed with the visualizations and interesting storyline. I am ready for the next movie. Received in perfect condition, and quick and easy transaction."
4,Is it better than Spiderman 2?,"I think this is a nice addition to the Spiderman movies but I personally liked the original Spiderman 2 a little better because some of the new scenes were different than the original and were not as good. I wish they just would have added new scenes without getting rid of some of the original scenes. For example, when Spiderman is riding the elevator, the original sequence is much better. In Spiderman 2.1 this scene is replaced with a similar scene that is not as funny. But the completely new scenes are good. Overall, a good addition to the Spiderman library."
4,Pretty Good,This extended was actually pretty good. The specials were great. The only real major problem I had was in said in the description that it would have a link to download the Spiderman 3 game PC demo and there was no of this in site on either disc. What gives?
4,:0),Good job i thought they might fall flat with 2 but i think they did a good job I'm from new york and i was in manhattan yesterday where they were filming spider 3 hope it is as much fun as 1 & 2
3,not as good as first of Raimi's Spiderman movies,I didn't quite enjoy Spiderman 2 as much as I did the first of Raimi's Spiderman movies. What I disliked about the movie is that it was dragged down by moments of silliness that were a bit more jarring than in the first movie. Some of the goofy scenes should have been cut and instead the production team should have used that screen-time to more effectively develop Doc Ock's character and the romantic sub-plot.
3,Peter Parker is hooked on Mary Jane,"This movie takes up where the first one left off. Peter (Toby Maguire) has fallen on bad times he is a loner happy because he knows as Spiderman he can not have friends including Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst); the bad guys would use his friends as pawns. Everything is going to pot. He loses his job, cant pay his rent, his aunt is on foreclosure, he can not make schedule on anything he does. His best friend is out to get Spiderman. And heaven forbid he is falling behind in school.Looks like it is decision time between his Spidy personality and Mary Jane Watson.Which does he chose?Which would you chose?Is there a way out of the dilemma?This film is very slow moving and depressing for at least the first third. They are relying on the reputation of the first Spiderman to carry this almost similar story. When the action picks up that is all it is just action. You may want to fast forward through this as nothing is said or reveled that will have any bearing on the end."
4,the first version is better!!,"i love spider man, and even though im a girl i read every issue and rent the cartoon versions. but i deeply got to say the first movie was better. dont laugh at my taste in movies thats just me, i personally think if they make a sequale to any movie they will ruin it. i would have gave it 2 or 3 stars but i love spiderman he rocks. they even make the bad guys look good. anyway see the firt movie than the second cause then you wouldnt understand aything. good job on another good movie. im sooo proud of another spiderman successes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Same movie but with 8 more mintues,"I bought this extended cut of SM 2 at Wal Mart last week and it was only $12.99 with a bonus disc lookin at the villains of Spidey 3. I grew up with Spider Man and these films do more than give justice to the character. I love these movies and Spidey 2 is by far the best comic book superhero movie ever made. This new Extended Cut adds little to the original movie but for fanboys like me, its awesome. The second disc has a featurette on the new scenes and one on winning the Oscar for Best Visual Efects and some other docs on the amazing visual effects and theres also a behind the scenes look at Spidey 3 and some trailers. Overall, this DVD is for fanboys ONLY. But it does look nice in your DVD collection. FYI, I bought this last week and Im hearing it's not even out yet...well, I guess Wal Mart does have everything...."
5,With great power comes great responsibility&#65533;,"Now only if Bush could have the same motto we'd all be better off.Spider Man was one of the best movies I have seen all year! All of my friends (ages: 41,42 and 50) went to go see it and it was so exhilarating, so entertaining, and so much fun to watch. I could easily go back and see it again. I am looking forward to Spider Man 3!Have fun and go see Spidey!"
5,This is a must have cd...,"There is not one song on this cd that you would want to pass over. It's a great disc for driving, parties, and just hanging out at home. And definitely see this band live if you get the chance--they put on a great show!"
2,"Unfortunately, it's noisy","I really liked this model. It played our DVDs and DivX movies very well. It started up quickly, its settings were well-designed, and it seemed sturdy.So why did I return it? Because it was noisy. We could clearly hear it running during movies. My old Liteon (non-upscaling) player was much quieter, and the new Sony and LG players we tried were virtually silent.Too bad. I liked everything else about the Pioneer, but the noise was a showstopper."
1,Disappointed at the quality slipping for Pioneer,"Less than a year old, but skips and freezes on nearly every movie. Plenty of ventilation, and clean scratch-free discs, still skips. Replaced it with a Panasonic DMP-BD35K Blu-Ray player which has much better upconversion."
4,Why spend more?,"I must agree with John H. Why bother spending hundreds of dollars on an hd player or blu-ray when one of them is going to become obsolete soon enough, when I can spend under 100 dollars and get an upconverting dvd player that works great for now. I did try out a cheaper model that was only 50 dollars, but it wouldnt play dvds very well and the dvd menus didnt really work either. I returned that player and got this one on a discount from an open item, and i am very happy with it."
5,best hdmi player,best picture quality excellent sound and very good aesthetics .price is very low .easy to convert to all region
5,Nice Product,"No complaints to speak of with this DVD player. I can see some improvement at 720p and 1080p vs my old Philips 480p player but nothing awe inspiring. My Samsung 1080p TV seems to do a great job on its own (progressive scanning). Haven't tried it yet on my Toshiba. The USB drive works perfectly but does not play everything that I throw at it. Using a flash drive, all of my picture files play and most of my short videos too but a few won't play at all while some have video but no audio and others have audio but no video. The remote looks fonky but works well and not overloaded with buttons that are never used. The player looks good but I don't even see it mixed in with a black DVD Player/Rec, SAT Receiver, A/V receiver etc. I don't find it noisy at all - I haven't tried it with the sound off but then why would I?"
4,DV-400V-K & USB FreeAgent,"I bought a 500GB Seagate Freeagent USB drive to go with my pioneer dv-400v-k. The hard disk only spins up when the pioneer is turned on, and configured for USB mode. I have 200 divx movies on the hard disk, and it takes about 20 seconds for the drive to spin-up and index all the files.This unit is not able to play divx files larger than 2GB, which means that I had to break a few files into 2 pieces. It starts playing the next part pretty quickly so this is not too bad.In all, this is a great unit for making a divx jukebox. If this player could play files larger than 2GB, had better fast-forwarding, and had an improved movie selection menu... it would be absolutely perfect. This player is much better than my philips DVP5982."
4,a great little DVD player,"Disc load time is pretty quick and the image I get over s-video to my CRT TV is very sharp. The usb port is a nice addition as I can take movies, music and pictures from my computer and display them directly on my television using just a usb stick. Surprisingly, I could also connect my 3G iPod and see all my music. However if you've ever done this on a computer with the iPod in disc mode you know that the files are all listed by their 4 letter code. This makes it impossible to find a specific song, but works great as a ""shuffle"" mode. I have the sound running to my 5.1 receiver through the digital coax and the Dolby processor doles out some very dynamic sound. All of this in a sleek, black form factor makes for one great little DVD player."
4,DVD upgrade,This Pioneer DVD player works well out of the box. The upgraded signal seems to work but it is hard for me to tell. But the one thing that really does work is that it reads all manner of DVDs which my other DVD recorders wouldn't do.
2,"Slow startup, cannot play all (region 1) DVDs","This DVD player is a disappointment: it takes more than 3 seconds before showing you that it received power-on command from the remote control; it's a region 1 player, so it cannot play discs from other regions, fair enough; HOWEVER, it cannot even play all the region 1 discs. Avoid this one!"
2,Warning! Not all USB drives will work - only low power drives.,"I bought this unit for the USB port. Pretty decent DVD player so far. I had a Philips and it beats that one hands down.Unfortunately, the USB port can only supply enough power for low power USB devices. The small flash drives will work. The bigger USB disk drives powered only by USB will not. The external disk drives that also have a power connection will work. Not nearly as convenient though.I give it two stars because of this drawback. Engineering-wise, it would not have been hard to supply more power. Frustrating.This limitation is mentioned in the instruction manual (but then again who would have access to that before purchasing, let alone wonder if their drive would work)."
1,no,"Bought this dvd player so that we can watch european dvds, the problem is that the player does not come modified to watch the dvds from UK right away. We sent it back and both it again from a vendor that sells it already modified for only a few bucks more."
2,Very disappointed!,"Since this was the number 2 rated DVD player in the 2008 CR Buying Guide, I thought I had nothing to lose. Wrong! The Standard definition picture is pretty bad; I knew that from the review. The 720p setting provides an extremely clear picture; I also knew that from the review. However, the disc tracking is absolutely horrible on this thing. A tiny smudge or scrape on a disc gives this player fits. Even discs that have no apparent defects won't play. I performned an experiment: Discs that wouldn't play on the Pioneer DV-400V WOULD play on my PS2 and a $30.00 Magnavox cheapie I got from WalMart. Needless to say, I'm returing it. The one thing that did work was the USB port. I really enjoyed putting podcasts on my thumb drive and playing them through my stereo."
3,Average,"This is my second DV-400K and this one keeps locking up on me forcing me to unplug it to get it to work. The other one I bought works better, so far. It does play almost anything I have thrown at it."
1,Died in a week,"Out of the box, the DV400 seemed like a decent player -- relative to my four year old Sony, it had better menu navigation, better remote, and more playback video/audio adjustments. Most importantly, it had the USB port, and it did a decent job of playing DIVX movie files.For the few days it worked.After about a week, it started skipping, stuttering, and stalling on every DVD attempted, even some that were literally brand new. All of them played fine in my other DVD player. Doesn't anyone have quality control anymore?Anyway, nice concept but it's on its way back for a refund."
2,"SEVERELY ALTERED ""Belle et la Bete""","...which is uncalled for. IT IS SPED UP from its original recording, making some of the high notes hit by the female singers truly chipmunk-like. I can't believe they would release this...let's speed it up to fit it on ONE disk! What a GOOD idea. No. Not a good idea."
2,More of the same,"Okay, I give up! The world (or at least the music industry) wants to keep Philip Glass's star in ascendance, with new commissions, and new recordings, or expensive repackagings of previously issued recordings. Glass hasn't had a new idea since 1976, when his ""Einstein on the Beach"" was the freshest new sound imaginable. Basically, all he's done is re-write that work over and over (and over!) again ever since. While there are cool parts to some of these scores, most of this is the same arpeggiated chords he's been using for the last 25 years! Somebody wake me up when this guy gets a new idea!"
1,Avoid purchasing this at all costs !!!,"Avoid purchasing this product. Even though Amazon lists the Region Code as ""1"" (U.S. and Canada only) the DVD I received was in a PAL format which does not play on my machine. Unfortunately, I had already opended the DVD before I realized it wouldn't play. So, when Amazon describes this offering as a region 1 -- DO NOT BELIEVE THEM !!!"
2,Would be great if I could watch it,"Never mentioned in the description that this was a PAL video from another region than the USA. An omission that means a lot. I was at this show, have seen clips, and was looking forward to seeing the entire thing now, 11 years later. Be forwarned - if you get this and live in America and do not own a multi-region player you will be out of luck."
5,The Best,"This is the best Corrs concert dvd. Great sound, home audience, band at the top of their form make this concert tops."
5,"The BEST, just the BEST!","I just watched this AWESOME DVD for the 1st time and it BLEW ME AWAY! The Corrs are the BEST!!!! However, my DVD didn't include a Booklet. Did anyone else get a Booklet with their DVD? Or does ""Live at Lansdowne Road"" not include a Booklet? Please post and let me know, thanks!"
3,A good look at an older viewpoint,"Overall a decent book, but for a conservative, traditional perspective I have to say that I did not agree with several chapters and a few points the author promoted."
3,Birds of Prey's ending felt too rushed.,"While I was deeply engrossed by this novel, one of the characters' deaths seemed like an afterthought of the author. The final and most important duel of the novel wasn't noble or suspenseful, but rather anti-climactic. And the book contained a few scenes of ""self love"" that could've been tastefully omitted."
2,Stereotypical adventure genre,"This was my first Wilbur Smith book. I thought it was all right for an adventure genre. There is enough historical research to add color. And it certainly moves along well. Many of the events are not believable, but you can say the same for James Bond. The book jumps between history and legend easily and superficially. Boys grow into manhood overnight. Women fall deeply in love by seeing someone from afar. Crocodiles are much more aggressive than in real life. But it is easy reading for passing a few hours."
5,Birds of Prey,"Another swashbuckling novel from the pen of Wilbur Smith that will not disappoint Wilbur Smith fans. Set in Africa before the British arrived, this novel gives a different perspective to other THE COURTNEYS OF AFRICA Wilbur Smith novels that will cause the reader to become misplaced with the action that exists from cover to cover."
5,Disagree with Kirkus. This is a rousing yarn!,"Unreadable my foot! This book grabs you and does not let go. From the very first to the last I can't think of a down time in this book. Swashbuckling at it's finest, click off the t.v. and prepare to stay up late."
5,What a magnificent book!!!,"Wilbur Smith has become one of my favorite authors. ""Birds of Prey"" was packed full of action, adventure, and romance. What more could one want in a novel! Much attention was given to detail. Be prepared to have your nautical dictionary at hand. Hal Courtney and the other charcters were developed in such a way that the reader has a genuine interest in their well-being. The plot is fast paced and keeps you turning the pages. I highly recommend this book, as well as, ""Elephant Song"", ""River God"", and ""The Seventh Scroll"". I can't wait to read the next Wilbur Smith novel."
4,Birds of Prey,I bought this book for pennies plus shipping still much cheaper than I could get at any store. It is in great condition and arrived in a timely fashion. Thank you.
5,GREAT!!! Right to the last word of the last paragraph.Thanks,"Your characters are alive and well.You had to have been there to write about them,Of course you weren""t but they ALIVE.I will read the rest of your novels.Thanks"
3,"Avast me hearties, a Pirates life","An exciting read that is a kind of cross between Treasure IslandTreasure Island: The Graphic Novel (Puffin Graphics)and Anthony Adverse in AfricaAnthony Adverse in Africa. It has a little too much sexual content for even an high school levelbut not very exceptional for popular novels today.Details of sea life and the hardships of prisoners is vividand realistic, but the compounding of gun powder in the African wilderness is very unlikely.Some suspension of credibility is to be expected with such fiction.That there were wars between the colonial powers:BelgiumFranceHolland ( Netherlands)EnglandGermanyPortugalSpainin Africa is not to be doubted. That the wars were thisextensive, this early is somewhat doubtful.The matchlocks used match the ones in the film The Seven SamuraiSeven Samurai - Criterion Collection - 3-Disc Remastered Editionas a Dutch weapon. The English of this period actually used Flintlockswhich needed no slow match from what I have read."
5,One of my all time favorites,"I have always been a Jeffery Archer fan, (Kan & Able, Prodigal Daughter, As the Crow Flies) until I was introduced to Wilbur Smith. Birds of Prey is a classic novel. It is well written, suspenseful and has quite a bit of history incorporated into this novel. You won't want to put it down!"
3,Not a great book,"This book was my second Wilbur Smith book, after ""River God"". ""River God"" was an excellent book, but this is not. It has some of the same elements of ""River God"" (well drawn characters, an interesting plot traversing many locales, and McGyver like ingenuity of the protagonists).However, in this book Smith brings into focus more needless torture and violence than necessary. This is a mark against it. (Some violence is fine and provides entertainment, but when it becomes a focus it seems the author is in need of some psychotherapy.)Also, the plot just is not as good. The last third of the book is entertaining, but this part should have been expanded and the beginning shrunk substantially. The beginning was a long drawn out period of awaiting what was foreshadowed (and takes you past the middle of the book to get to where it really begins).Therefore, I recommend other Wilbur Smith books above this one."
2,A passable swashbuckling novel,"This is a reasonably good novel until it degenerates into a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" story. The author did not seem to know how to end the tale, and continued from one misadventure to another. The author failed to keep all of his characters on the same time line, a problem when an author does not outline things properly. He also disposes of various characters as if he is tired of them, or does not know what to do with them, in order to introduce new characters. Perhaps a few too many dead bodies left by the wayside."
4,Eloquently written swashbucking adventure,"My first experience reading a Wilbur Smith novel was an overwhelmingly positive one. Smith does a first rate job in painting a descriptive verbal landscape of the world in 1667 through the eyes of protagonist Hal Courtney, son of the captain of a royal commissioned English privateering vessel. We get transported from the ocean drenched decks of a battle tested ""pirate"" ship to depths of a Dutch colonial dungeon in Africa in following the adventures of Hal, his father Sir Francis and his shipmates. Smith spins a tale of comradeship, loyalty and betrayal which had this reader thirsting for revenge against the enemies of the heroes. Of course, all ends relatively well for the ""good"" guys with enough unfinished business to pave the way for a sequel. I am anxiously looking forward to reading that sequel ""Monsoon""."
2,Boring,I've read nearly every novel by Wilber Smith. This is the only one that has ever disappointed me. The characters were boring and the story was very predictable. There are many other authors that write this type of novel much better. Smith should stick to modern themes.
3,Light reading,"An enjoyable enough read -- although like some other reviewers, I am somewhat skeptical of the accuracy of Smith's research. The characters are fairly one dimensional and the ""bad guys"" are prototypical.Beyond that, it is entertaining -- kinda like a summer action flick -- lots of action, not much substance.Kid Alert! This novel has some extremely graphic sex scenes."
5,The Best of the Best,"I've just discovered Wilbur Smith and I cannot wait to devour all of his titles! This book is so vital and picturesque, everything just leaps off the page at you. It's so great to get lost in this story. It really takes you out of the boring mundanity of daily life and whisks you back to mid-19th C Africa! Highly recommended read."
2,"A trashy, macho bodice-ripper for guys.","When I started reading Birds of Prey, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and setting. Then I started groaning at the incredibly predictable behavior of the cardboard cutout characters. By 1/4 of the way through, I found myself hypnotized by the parade of every stereotypical character I remember from the trashy adventure books I loved when I was 12. The young, perfect hero. His loyal negro sidekick. The noble, tragic father. The backstabbing piratical villain. The fat, ugly, cowardly, corrupt, rich villain. The cruel villain who is, however, a ""true warrior"". The sultry temptress. The beautiful imprisoned princess. A half-dozen more plot elements which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the book. In every way, at best an average book."
4,Rare Find,"If you have ever seen Wayne Chochran live then you know what an incredible show it was. Unfortunately, it is next to impossible to find any CD recording of his. This complilation, although sonically challenging, is representative of his show. It was very nostalgic for me to hear him once again and it took me back to the El Macombo in Toronto over 30 years ago when I first saw him live. If you are interested in his music buy this - there really is not anything else available. Truly, one of the greatest artists of the era."
4,CHAR,"THE WHITE KNIGHT OF SOUL (GET DOWN WITH IT) WAS VERY GOOD I WAS BORN IN MIAMI FL, THOSE OF US OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER HIM IN THE 60-70 I LIKE MOST FORGOT ABOUT HIM HE ALIVE A WELL STILL IN MIAMI"
1,"RED's, why do we need them?","THIS THING SUCKS!!!! You know it, I know it, let's not jest here. It's totally useless, totally pointless, and did I mention it sucks?!?Sincrely,Drew"
2,What Regulars?,This book lacks the personal anecdotes from enlisted men that would have made this a successful tome. Even the Volunteers in the Philipines are not covered well.
4,How this book has helped me,"The Fundamentals of Management book has helped me in many ways. The exhibits and charts in this book are great. They enable the learner(me) to understand processes easier. The book taught me that management is a part of our lives everyday, whether we know it or not. I would recommend this book to anyone taking a management class."
5,Helped with Management class!!!,This book was extremely helpful and was pre-owned when I bought it but that actually helped me!!! This book helped me exceed in the class and helped ensuring that my major was the perfect fit for me! Shipped quickly and was in good condition! Enjoyed the book very much.
3,Easy Read,"This was the first time a professor made me read a complete textbook from cover to cover, but the book was an easy read. There were interesting little side-bars about different companies, people and/or situations. What I didn't really care for was how many times things were repeated...""didn't I just read this?"""
3,Detailed Material,This book was very detailed in giving information. It covered quite a few areas of management. Sometimes with the wording used and the context it sometimes took me at least 2 or 3 times reading it before I fully understood what was being said. However this was the first business class I have ever taken and my limited knowledge probably had something to do with that. All in all it was a fair book.
4,Fundamentals of Management Essential Concepts and App.,Starting out this book was very interesting but it lacks in some understanding of the definitions. I liked the whold idea about the definitions being at the side of the pages. I wish there were a short summary at the end of the chapters though. Also there were a couple of places in the chpt. that was written unclear or maybe just hard to understand. A lot of the charts and graphics used in this text book was very helpful in understanding what i couldn't understand in the text. I would say this text is easier to understand than most of my other classes though. I esspecially thought the leadership chapter was very interesting and very enjoyable to read. I believe overall this was a great textbook but all textbooks have thier problems but fortunally this one didn't have many!
4,Business Management,"I really like this book, the way it is set up, the way it looks, and the way it is presented. The most useful part of the book was at the end of the chapters was a through chapter test. If every book I had was set up this way I think I would do very well in my classes. Each chapter was well explained and the illustrations and graphics were very good and learning oriented."
3,"In bad shape, but still usable","The book cover had been chewed on/off by an animal, but all the text was there and usable. I paid extra to have it shipped with a 2-4 day delivery. It came on the 4th day. Overall, everything was OK. Not great, but not bad either."
3,business book,The book was fine-however my teacher required the media cd to use with the book. I ended up having to buy the book with the cd at my school bookstore. Now I have two of these books. Not sure if I will ever by college books online again
4,"Great condition, good service","This book arrived a bit later than scheduled, but I didn't absolutely need it by the time of arrival. It was in great condition, just as stated, and was glad that it actually did arrive in a timely fashion coinciding with the given time I had."
3,College student review,"I used this book in my business class. I found a few chapter's completely uninformative and rather boring. One such chapter was on communication and the other was on motivation. Either of which, if you have basic common sense is more helpful then the textbook.The book is also very contradictory in its writing and examples. It seemed to me the author's had an agenda which was to push the business practices and ideas they deem the best, then bash the rest in a sneaky backhanded way. Then later on in the same chapter compliment the other side, as a means to try to make it balanced.I would never use this book for personal exploration or knowledge not worth it."
4,Four Star Mangement Book,"This Fundamentals of Management book is a great introduction to management for college students. It introduces the material in an easy to read yet very informative manner. The chapter summaries are a great way to ensure that I know the main points of each chapter. The charts and diagrams fit in well with the information being explained. Also, the current business situations, which are given to supplement the reading on various pages, helped to understand real world management applications. However, I did find the chapters to be somewhat long, perhaps a more consolidated approach to explain the material would be beneficial. Overall, I feel this book will help me in the long run in any career field I may choose to enter, not just management."
4,Fundamentals of Management,"Upon reading this book, I have learned many aspects of management that can be applied to every day life. For example, each chapter has a section entitled ""Developing a Management Skill."" These skills are appropriate not only for management but for all aspects of living. Some of the skills include: Becoming More Creative; Guidelines for Acting Ethically; and Building Trust. I have also found the test at the end of each chapter very effective in helping me review material for tests. There is also a section in each chapter called ""Understanding Yourself."" This section has helped me to determine certain career goals for my future. It has enabled me to be aware of the characteristics I posess. The overall setup of this book is very good, and I would reccommend it to anyone interested in business or management."
4,Fundamentals of Management,"Overall I believe this book is a quality product, although it needs some work to be done. It need to have more situations in the book that further the explanation of what is actually taught. Also when going over the chapter you should come out with real hard hitting knowlege and this book lacks this a little. Needs improvement but is overall fairly done."
4,a helpful tool in the learing process,"My name is Jeff Heeley and I'm a soph. at Hannibal-LaGrange college in Hannibal, MO. I have been currently studying with this text throughout the current fall semester in Principals of Business Management. I have rather enjoyed this text and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Management, they could not only benefit from this book, but could also have a good time while doing so. The book is filled with tid-bits of knowledge that will help you in your excusion in Management. The author did a wonderful job explaining the material in a way that is easy and helpful. I would rate this book higher than others that I'm currently using in other related courses. I don't really think that this book has enfluenced my career choice, but it has been helpful none the less. Even if your not planning on being a manager, you could benefit from this book, in that everyone needs to know how to think like a manager, or how your manager is thinking."
3,Not too shabby,I have begun my second semester of business major classes. This semester I am taking Management and I have the same teacher as I did for Marketing last semester. He has selected two basic vocabulary educational books. Fundamentals of Management has been a good book in explaining the vocabulary and the text book rules of management. The layout of the chapters is in a reasonable order to understand management. The charts are very useful and the outline at the beginning of each chapter and the sample questions at the end of each chapter help prepare for the test. I highly recommend this book if you want to teach the text book rules.
3,Worth the play but needs a better choice for main character............,"Above average game,but the main character's lack of personality and stoic reaction to everything that happens to him, takes away from the immersion in the story. After awhile you don't care if he makes it through the game or not.....Good graphics and sound management though....And well written storyline overall...."
1,no help,"adventure company does not respond to pleas for help in correcting persistent problems in running this program,their response mirrors the theme of this game"
3,"Average game, gets weird","I like adventure/puzzle games. Black Mirror begins well, though the main character is almost irritatingly droll. My biggest complaint about the game is the final sequence, it just goes completely off the wall. I finished because I was determined not to waste the money. But I kept asking myself, ""Is THIS what I invested my time for??"
1,Badly edited,This started out well but laborious repetition made it impossible to finish and Although i NEVER normally give up on books I packed this one in. I won't be in a rush to read more
1,could not get into it,I never give up on a book but just could not get into this book. Sorry to sa..y I had to with this one though. I'm glad that this was free otherwise I would want my money back.
1,Gratuitous gore,I don't think a book needs to contain such gory scenes to be a thriller. I wish I had gone with the preview because I would have read no further than that. This book was immediately deleted.
1,Disgusting,Not my idea of a good time. Could not get past the 1st chapter. One has to be of a type different from me to enjoy this.
3,The History of Corvettes,"This book would be good for people who want to know more about the history of corvettes. I would suggest this book to people who collect cars and want to make that collection bigger. My favorite corvette is the 1963 Stingray. I like it because of the rareness of the car. I also like it because of the split rear window and the spine running down the center of the roof. This book was all about the history of the corvette from start to now. They talked about the different types of corvettes and the rareness of some of them. The most expensive corvette was the 1963 stingray. It is the most expensive because of the split rear window, the spine, and they only made around 1000 of them. My dad has a 1968 camero that I help work on at home. I really like old cars and I like to ride in them as much as possible."
5,Hot Soca,"I enjoyed this album,it has non- stop party tunes.Many of my favorite Soca Artist. Good show TP Productions.I give this album 5 Stars. listen to it and be the judge.Go the Red White and Black."
4,Why we are are a world power,"This book is a must for any history teacher. I disagree with a couple of the author's assertions, but it is a great read and clearly outlines how we became the world power we are today. It also dispels some of the arguments that expansion was motivated mostly by racism. Clearly, Admiral Mahan is one of the most important and least studied people in American history."
4,ok,"marvel fan, I watch everything I can find and collect all as well. Worth getting for an marvel fan to add to a collection."
3,Spiderman good but short,The dvd was good as far as it goes. My grandson loved it. My only complaint would be that it is pretty short (64 minutes) for what it cost.
1,Spider Man - Extreme Threat,"I was very disappointed in this movie. My young grandson loves Spiderman and Superman movies. I purchased this DVD for his birthday. However, after viewing this movie, I found this animated version to have inappropriate language throughout. I cannot recommend this movie to other parents or grandparents."
3,You missed the point of the book.,"I believe the others who wrote these reviews failed to notice a few points to this book. First, the book was written by officers wives, and though the military may not be the same today, it was as they said, 15 years ago. Don't turn a blind eye to this sociologically sound item, it may just open your eyes to how life really was for military wives, particularly those of the soldiers drafted in the 60's and 70's. One more point, those of you judging the book by today's military standards have missed the fact that this book speaks of a different military. Don't judge the book by an all volunteer force, as it is today. The era between 1950 and 1990 was much different than it is today. Think while you read."
4,Permission,"Although this book was written in 1990 and many changes have taken place since then, and changes continue to be made, the accuracy is unbelievable. Personally, I believe the military person should read this to see what it feels like to be a military spouse. Only military spouses know the actual hardships and I for one am glad I read this book. It gave me persmission to finally say that yes, being a military spouse is hard without sounding like a complaint. Being a military spouse is easier than it was 20 years ago and let's hope if another book is written in 20 years, it will be much better still. This book gives a voice to military wives that has been quiet for so long . My only regret is that I didn't read the book in 1990!!"
1,Cometarios para el autor,"Por favor dirija sus comentarios directamente al autor:Sr. Orlando Nodal Acosta, 1812 Blue Ridge Drive, Jacksonville, Florida 32246. El es ambos el autor y el dueno de Outer Space Press."
1,Drive can't read CD-R/CD-RW's,"I've had the drive for a few months now, and it worked fine during most of this time. But a couple weeks ago, the drive stopped working with CD-R's. It simply won't recognize the disc, and causes the entire computer to stall at times. It can still read regular CD's. Now I own a broken Sony mini-stero system (a gift), a broken Sony car CD changer (also a gift), and this broken Sony CD-R drive. I won't be fooled again into buying any more Sony junk."
3,Go with the Chambord.,"This is my second Bodum French Press. I had the 8-cup Chambord and decided to go larger, so I purchased the 12-cup Kenya.The old Chambord had a finer mesh and a secondary plastic screen to filter the coffee; however, I believe the assembly is the same now for both the Chambord and Kenya.During three months of using the Kenya, the glass beaker slipped from the plastic handle once while I was washing it. Luckily, it didn't break--that never happend with the Chambord. After three months, the plastic collar that holds the mesh assembly was stripped and would come apart during the plunging. I emailed Bodum and they sent a metal collar at no cost.I would recommend going with the Chambord. Still, it's better than any drip coffee maker I've used."
5,Brio engine,This is one of the cutest little engines I've seen! The diagonally striped boiler rotates as the engine moves. It's compatible with the wooden Thomas the Tank series.
3,Works as expected ...,"Although I'm quite pleased with this product I can't say it's better than any others. Of course, when it comes time to refill I will buy from the same seller. I'm very satisfied with their way of doing business."
4,Masada health and Beauty Foot Bath,"Just like the previous review, the foot bath salt worked but have not purchased any more of these products. It does relax you feet."
5,Peppermint Blissful Product Removes PAIN in Joints and Muscles,"The name MASADA is known for All Natural Original Real Life High Quality Products that work very well. This is one of their very BEST. It is a Foot Bath Treatment that will renew, re-energize, relax your feet like nothing else. It is nothing short of Amazing. It works on corns and will smooth out all the rough places, and works so well on muscles you will feel Heavenly! Use a cloth to work it into your calves and knees for a super leg treatment. I believe it is perfectly safe for a tub soak. This product delivers on every count- it is just Fantastic!"
4,First Massage,"I can remember when I first started giving massages. Picking out music was one of the hardest tasks. I was in an alternative independent record store when I saw the album Music Mantras I. I used my boyfriend (now my husband), as a guiena pig to give a massage to the new music. It was wonderful! It is one of my clients' favorite cds and is my #1 favorite. My cd got scratched and skips so I am immediately buying one to replace it. The music is very soothing and some of the songs almost angelic-like."
5,Must-have for troubleshooters,"I occasionally need to fix broken IPC code and figure out behavior differencesof legacy code between Solaris, Linux, etc., code written years ago by somebodyelse in C.This book, (and Stevens' earlier books before this) has been immensely useful.The code samples alone are worth their weight in gold :-). Seriously, this bookhas saved me many days of hard work, several times over.A quick browse of the book is usually enough to find the details (what I wouldcall 'arcane details', but I guess this is because I'm not an expert C/networkingprogrammer), figure out the problem AND how to fix the problem.This book has been a 'project-saver'. I cannot recommend this text too highly."
5,"Very detailed, but well indexed reference","Everything you wanted to know (and probably didn't care to know) about linux.The only drawback are some of the builtin functions that he uses. These are usually uppercase modifications of the lower case functions. It creates one more step for the reader, if they don't want to use his builtin functions."
5,selfish pleasure,"""OPEN, OH, SESAME""the tales of the arabian knights, the stories of Ali Baba, the beauty ofMaria Montez, this was a motion picture that i first saw in the 1960's.along with a double bill of Arabian Knights, or something like that, alsostarring Jon Hall. Jon Hall, famous for ""Ramar, of the Jungle"", so i'man eclectic collector. i know what i like, and what i enjoy."
2,Beware of False Advertising!,"Sabu does not appear in this film. Also, this DVD version omits opening and closing scenes! If you're a credits buff, you'll get none here."
4,"Love, Turhan Bey","The 40s gave us lots of wonderful 'escapism' action movies and this is one of the best. The characters, colorful action sequences and light story line provide lots of entertainment. Among the 'eye candy' characters is a young Turhan Bey. He later moved on to main character roles before disappearing entirely. Then he came back in the 90s to appear in movies and tv episodes! Maria Montez was a beauty who was gone too soon and I later enjoyed a tv series with Jon Hall as 'Ramar of the Jungle'."
5,Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves (Universal Backlot Series) DVD,"For a long time I had this film on a NTSC LaserDisc and has been a big hit with me, now I have it on a DVD it was again a joy to watch, but to my even more enjoyment it has been release on a Region B Blu-ray disc and I will soon be purchasing it, as it will look even more exciting and stunning on that format.Although it is an old film, it still stands the test of time and because it was filmed in Tecnicolor, the colours look even as good as it was filmed in the 21st Century, so if you enjoy a good and exciting Arabian Adventure, then you should have this in your collection.Mr. Andrew C. MillerLe Cinema ParadisoWARE, England."
4,Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,Great to see an old classic. The movie arrived by the date promised and I look forward to future purchases from Amazon.
5,Simple,Works great. Simply plug & play. I connected it to another 4 port hub that is powered. Everything that I've plugged in works perfectly.
4,Cables Unlimited USB 2.0 4 Port Mini Hub,"I use this at school so after I unplug my laptop to store securely for the night I only have to plug in one usb connector the next morning to get going. The hub is small, fits well on the desk, and has so far worked without fault."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"Please heed my warning. This movie sucks! I just want to be honest. My girlfriend and I just wasted 20 minutes of our lives and $15 fastforwarding through the most grossly mismarketed movie ever. With due respect or whatever, no one buying a movie to get more Dylan cares about Mickey Jones namedropping about people who no one cares about. This is NOT a Dylan movie. This is shameless marketing b.s. Lame."
1,"My friend has a better title: ""Glimpses of Bob""","I'm giving this one star because ""zero stars"" isn't an option. There's not a whole lot of Dylan in this, and the ""home movies"" are just what you'd expect from the days of 8mm film: grainy, blurry, black and white films from the tour...not ""of the tour"", just from the tour. Tourist kind of stuff, with a lot of the back of Dylan's head, and every once in awhile he'll turn around - which is why my friend has retitled this DVD ""Glimpses of Bob"".And listening to Mickey Jones reminisce about his glory days of 40 years ago is kind of tedious; Mickey's looking like he's seen better days.Save your money up and get ""No Direction Home"", much more entertaining and informative."
1,Very Misleading,"I purchased this book to add to my frugal cookbook collection.Unfortunately, this book should not be classified under cookbooks, but rather homestead living. Even then, it is not up to par. I guess if you were the type of individual preparing for the former Y2K, this book would have been handy. But, not for the average individual looking for ways to save in their kitchen.There is included a chapter on home butchering, and that is limited to rabbits. Would have found it more helpful to include wild duck, pork or turkey also.Definitely not worth the cost."
2,I'm ready to settle,"Alright, I really wanted to like this recording, Hi Fidelity is one of my favorite books and I love the movie very much. The cast recording is highly disappointing. The lyrics are bad, really bad. The music is catchy and if you are a fan of the book and or movie its kind of neat to hear the parts of the story in song but honestly the only good part of this cast recording is leading man Will Chase playing Rob."
3,Not what it claims to be,"I was pretty disapointed in this item. The title claims the VHS has ""The Snow Queen"", ""The Wild Swans"", and ""Alice and the Mystery of the Third Planet"". Unfortunately the only one actually on the VHS was Alice and the Mystery of the Third Planet."
1,Teaches Food Paranoia,"As a Psychologist, I believe mealtimes are sacred events. Family bonding takes place and culture is often passed to the next generation at this event. After reading this book, the author would have you believe all food in America is poisoned and will kill you. I agree with the first reviewer, save your money and don't buy the book."
1,Do Not Buy,"If you are looking, as I was, for an informative dvd that really talks about fall prevention, do not order this dvd. It runs for 9 minutes and costs nearly $90.00! I thought I would be getting a workbook or something with it for that type of money, but no. It is just a dvd that lasts 9 minutes and is poorly done, at that!"
3,switched out movie,"These movies are classics! I received the package though and it was preopened. The one disk, The Year Without a Santa Claus the animated version, was switched out for the full length movie instead. I kept the set for future use but the description should be more clear if the disks do not match at delivery."
1,Incorrect Packaging - Twice!!!,"Twice I tried to acquire this classic DVD set. And both times received a box set without shrink wrap. And the DVD that should contain the Year Without A Santa Clause stop motion animation turned out to be a feature film with the same title featuring Delta Burke and John Goodman.Twice I was disappointed. And to add insult to injury, the replacement disk set was also missing one of its 4 disks. This was ordered through Amazon, therefore I have no idea whom the vendor was.[...] for this one."
5,Classic Christmas Favorites,Loved these movies while growing up!! My nieces and nephews love them just as much...bought this set for them!! Cannot go wrong with Rankin & Bass :)
2,be sure to check the discs,"As many have stated, I also got the wrong disc. After reading the last few reviews, I was hoping the problem was fixed. So not only am I missing the stop action ""year without a Santa Claus"", but the other two shows too. I've yet to try to return it or contact anyone, but why should this problem still be happening? Customers shouldn't have to return discs or make calls for a problem that has been known for over a year. I feel this doesn't speak well of Amazon.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I wrote to Amazon and within hours I received an email and will receive a refund. However in order for me to purchase it from another seller, it will cost a bit more. I hope I receive the right disc this time."
1,Don't order this set unless you want to be disappointed,"I ordered this set last year just after Christmas and stored it away with my Christmas items. This year, tonight, we pulled it out after promising the kids we'd watch ""Mr. Heat Miser"" after dinner. What a joke! There on the cover of the package are the original Mr. Heat Miser and his brother, but on the actual disc is the live action (lame) movie from the 2000s starring John Goodman.Yes, NOW I have read the other reviews saying you can call an 800-number to get a replacement disc. I just called that number. It's not open until Monday, during business hours.What can I say? This is straight-up false advertising and the producers of this disc should honestly be sued.DON'T ORDER IT!!!"
5,Awesome,"We received this in a quick and timely manor and the service was great. The movie worked, was a great price and had no blemishes. We loved it and would defiantly do business with them again. Thanks"
4,"For Everyone Who Got The Wrong ""A Year Without A Santa Clause""","If you purchased the Classic Christmas Favorites boxed set and have the 2006 live action remake of The Year Without a Santa Claus instead of the Rankin-Bass version, you can call Warner Customer Support at 800-553-6937 and they'll send you the correct version."
1,DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ADVERTISED MOVIES,"We just bought this set and the first one my dayghter wanted to see was ""The Year Without A Santa Claus."" Too bad this was not included as advertised (neither was Nestor the Long Eared Donkey or Rudolph's Shiny New Year). Instead there was some very bad live action version. NOT WHAT I ORDERED. Bad business practice on the part of WB."
1,What a jip!,"When I got this set, I wanted to see ""The Year Without A Santa Claus,"" my favorite X-mas show. Someone at the plant must have put the wrong disc in the box. Instead of the 1974 version, there was a live action version with John Goodman. What a rip off! Can I get the actual one that is advertised on the box?"
1,Wrong DVD,I was really disappointed when I went to watch the Year without a Santa Claus. For some reason WB packaged it with the wrong version. So don't risk buying this and get the crappy new version.
1,poor substitute,"For those of you nostalgic for the old Christmas TV specials...move on. Except for the Grinch and year w/o a Santa Claus, the rest of these ""specials"" will remind you why you turned off the TV when you were 8. Let's face it not all Rankin Bass oldies were goodies. Frosty and Rudolph's Christmas in July is just downright embarassingly bad. This DVD is full of real let downs...there's a reason TV channels don't rerun what's on this set. Move on."
2,Sheer Stupidity in putting this package together.,"Was someone asleep when they put this set together? Not only does the promo at the beginning of Disc 1 list ""Little Drummer Boy-book II"" as being part of the set, it's nowhere to be found on the package. Second, Disc 2 is a write off-having a completely different film by the same name as ""The Year Without A Santa Claus"" in place of the Rankin/Bass classic. With it's absence, you also lose the other features on that disc - namely ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" and ""Nestor, the Long Eared Christmas Donkey"". Thankfully, I do have those elsewhere, but I did buy this with the understanding that it would have ""Little Drummer Boy-Book II, and it's not there. Never in my life have I seen such a sloppy Video or audio package. This could have been a 5 star set if everything had been as advertised."
3,Classic Christmas Favorites,"Rated this just ok. It did have a few of my kids' favorites, but there were several more they could have used instead of the lesser known cartoons. Overall, decent."
2,Silent Night!!!,"Loved the movies that we first watched on disc 2...but as we got to disk 3...it was the classic production of Silent Night. Yup! You got it...Not ONE of the movies on disk 3 had any sound to them. Just felt really sad for the kids who were actually looking forward to seeing the shows (including me)....Best thing to say after reading all these reviews is, Buyer Beware, and KEEP your receipt..."
4,childhood favs,"My husband and I love the stop motion Christmas shows from our youth. I thought 10 for a little more than the cost of 1 was a great bargain. They look fantastic! They are all in HD and look better than the originals we saw on TV. Some of the 10 titles we weren't familiar with and some we remembered but they rarely showed on TV - now we know why, they aren't so awesome. Even with that it's still a great bargain and we enjoyed watching the ones we like."
1,Wrong DVD included in the package,"Like many others I purchased this item because it is supposed to include ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" (1974) on 1 of the 4 disc. On the same disc is supposed to be two additional titles. What was included was a disc only containing ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" (2006). Sent Time Warner an email, let's see if they get back to me!"
1,Wrong DVD,The second disc is incorrect. It is the 90 minute movie remake of year without a Santa Claus not the classic cartoon.
1,What a rip off,"What a let down to find that what was advertised as being on the dvd set was not there. The one show I wanted the most: The Year Without a Santa Claus, although pictured on the cover was not there but replaced with the horrible live version. It is missing many other shows too. I want a refund."
2,Not so interesting to a 4yr old...,"We bought this for XMas for our 4 yr old because she wanted the Grinch movie and we thought she'd enjoy the other stories. She's only been interested in the Grinch (at least she knows what she wants, hehe) and has not finished watching the other stories. No interest at all. I found all of these stories to be totally outdated for today's kids. It was an inexpensive purchase, but what's worse, is that this DVD will sit around the house. Maybe by next XMas our daughter will have more interest in this product; otherwise we'll get rid of it."
5,A wonderful trip down memory lane,"This collection is unbelievable!! I can't really understand the complaints of other people on this product, maybe I would get it if I had already bought these elsewhere, but I haven't. For the $30 I spent at Target I have more than got my money's worth. My daughter (6) and I have been watching this for 2 hours and we aren't even off the first disc yet! I love seeing my daughter get the same enjoyment out of these classics as I did once upon a time. This is a magical and worthwhile investment for a neat collection of holiday classics! Enjoy this with your family like I am with mine!!! :D"
2,Wrong Version of The Year Without a Santa Claus,"Deceptive advertising. Certainly NOT a Christmas Classic. Disk 2 was supposed to be the stop action version of The Year Without a Santa Claus. The characters are all over the cover. I would not buy it, I am returning my copy.Shame on you Amazon for not pulling the product or placing a BIG disclaimer."
1,Forget Mr. Heat Miser,"Somehow we missed the fact that The Year Without A Santa Claus isn't actually in this collection; instead of the classic animated version, there is a garish live action film. Since Disc 2 was completely replaced by the live action piece, all of the classics that are mentioned on the packaging are missing: The Year Without A Santa Claus, Rudolph's Shiny New Year,and Nestor, The Long Eared Christmas Donkey."
1,Classic DVD,I am 100% disappointed with this Classics DVD set. I am especially disappointed with the 'The Year Without a Santa Claus' version. I was led to believe ALL the shows were the Rankin Bass Classics by the wording and pictures on the DVD cover.
1,Wrong DVD for Disk 2,"Very angry with product. The main disk we wanted was changed with on that featured John Goodman as the Santa in the year without a Santa Claus. NOT, what we ordered nor was it children appropriate."
5,Great Rare King movie,"This is a real great movie, but pretty hard to find. I am a big Stephen King fan and this movie is on my top 3 favorite king movies. This movie should be as popular as Carrie, and The Shining,Based on the short story by king, The movie takes place in a small town. Jim Norman lived in the town as a kid but a terrible thing happend there. His brother was killed by a group of switch blade, leather jacked wearing punks. The group was killed in a tunnel by a train. Now, Jim comes back to the small town to become a teacher. The the group of kids are back, and they are not happy.This is a real good movie to own if you are a SK fan. If you liked kings other work. I really think that you will love this one. Pick it up at amazon."
3,You don't have to be a Stephen King fan to like this.,"This movie was a really good made for T.V. movie, it has a good plot, every entertaining, and unlike alot of Stephen King movies it has a good ending."
3,Predictable,"When I watch movies that reflects back to a previous time in the main characters life too many times, you know that the villain is , ""going to come back."""
5,I Sometimes they come back,I thought it was a good movie. I liked it before I purchased. A good one to have in my collection. Kind of edge of your seat sometimes. Worth the money and time watching.
1,Not very good at all,Don't buy this waste of time. Not particularly well done at all. Another recent Steve King failure.I am to the point now where if I see Kings name on a movie I just will not buy it.
1,Disappointed,"I had bought this gift for my mom for xmas, and I thought it was a good price deal. When my mom opened it, she was so happy. But then when it came time to watch the dvd on our dvd player, it didn't have the playback feature. Turns out that this dvd was a burnt dvd and hadn't been converted correctly. I could still watch it on my computer, but the picture wasn't good quality at all. I don't recommend anyone buy this. Very disapppointed."
5,"""Sometimes they Come Back""","I viewed this movie and I can't just get enough of it. The car in this movie really sets the scene, Richard Lawson was my favorite character nobdy hits him and lives ha ha ! I would definetly recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror or someone who just want's a good scare."
4,One of my favourite favourite films,"This film always makes me laugh, cheers me up, instills a bit of hope that there can be happy endings. A funny scene from the film: C.D: ""One more step and I'm leaving."" Roxanne: ""What did you say?"" C.D: ""I said 'One more step and I'm leaving'"" Roxanne: ""Oh."" C.D: ""What did you think I said?"" Roxanne: ""I thought you said 'Earn more sessions by sleeving."" C.D: ""Well what the hell does that mean?"" Roxanne: ""I don't know, that's why I asked."" (you've got to be there, honest) If you're looking for a funny, feel-good movie, this is a film for you......."
5,Steve Martin is hilarious!,"This is a classic Steve Martin movie. He is sooo funny, the best Steve Martin ever! My favorite scene is when C.D. (Steve) says 20 insults about his nose. I highly recommend this movie because the plot is sweet and funny, and the characters are great!"
4,"Sneeze, and it's ""Goodbye, Seattle""","__________________This is such a good movie. Like other screenplays Steve Martin has written, it's based on a classic piece of literature. The scene (about 30 minutes in) where Martin's character comes up with 20 different jokes about his nose actually has more than 20 (count 'em), which is something we no-lifes notice while watching.Daryl Hannah -- sweet, gorgeous, tall, talented, unemployed? That's a shame. Her performance in this movie is the best of any of hers that I've seen. A few years later she had a cameo in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" -- a truly great movie -- in which, alas, she had to play a stereotypical dumb blonde actress.There are so many laughs, and so much sensitivity, that I'm not surprised at all that ""Roxanne"" is my sister's favorite Steve Martin movie. I love ""L.A. Story"", but have to give a slight edge to ""Roxanne""."
3,Good Funny Movie,I enjoyed it. Its not something to watch more than afew times; Daryl Hannah is good in it and so is Steve Martin.
2,Where is the widescreen?,"It's September 2006, and they *still* have not released a widescreen version. I got through the first 20 minutes of this pan-and-scan version before I couldn't stand it anymore. There are so many beautiful shots; I just can't watch them butchered like this.Roxanne is a great movie, and it deserves more than this poorly rendered DVD version."
1,Pan & Scan travesty,"Like other reviewers, I am apalled that this wonderful movie is available only in pan & scan format, chopping off close to half the picture. This is just inexplicable--even when this was released a few years ago, it was quite unusual for high profile anamorphic films like this to be released only in a P&S version. I'd love to add this to my collection--here's hoping a propererly framed version is forthcoming (hopefully also in Blu-Ray or HD DVD)."
4,Roxanne,"Steve Martin is C.D. Bales, a perfect catch for any woman except for one drawback. He has a huge nose. Everyone is hypnotized by it. No one can ignore it. The movie is a take-off on the play, Cyrano de Bergerac. C.D. works for the fire department and falls for Roxanne, an astronomy student. Because of his nose, he courts her through a friend. Romance and humor intertwine. The scene in which Martin enumerates insults about his nose is brilliant."
2,PG-13,"I am eighteen years old and I was stupid enough to watch this movie with my family. ""Roxanne"" was innappropriate for family viewing due to I don't know how many references to sex, and one shot of the title character's backside while she was, shall we say, un-clothed. It was a funny movie, and I might possibly recommend it for adults and older teens, but definitely not for anyone under the age of fifteen. I do not see how this movie could have earned a PG rating instead of PG-13, which I believe it deserved."
1,still waiting to receive product,I purchased the above movie over a month ago and was told to expect delivery before Aug 8. I still have not received this movie. Could someone please find my movie????
1,I want the three dollars I used to rent this back,"I really don't care what anyone says. I could not finish this movie. It was horrible. I was forced into renting it because we had to do this Cyrano de Bergerac/Roxanne compare/contrast sheet for French. I am unhappy that I had to shell out three bucks to rent a movie I never even really wanted to see. The fact that it was a bad movie didn't help the situation.Steve Martin may think he's being clever, but really he isn't. I absolutely hated his charcter, who, despite his big nose, was awfully cocky. Now, I wasn't a huge fan of the real Cyrano de Bergerac, so that MAY be part of the problem. Nevertheless, the plot made me roll my eyes and every bit of the movie bored me to tears. Please try to find something that is actually witty and funny, like The Simpsons. The Simpsons knows how to paraody literature."
4,Decent,This is an event that is pretty specific to the Midwest but people from all over come out to enjoy the bboy and popping battles.It's a good video. BBoys like lil' dvs and most the Brickheads and Motion Disorders crew (Both are on and off champs of Scribble jam). Nikodemus makes an appearance in the poppin battles and Kmel is one of the judges.It's not spectacular but if you're looking for something that can hold you down till you get other dvds like Bboy unit Uk bboy Championship then this is something to look into.
4,Bregenz Concert,Even though someone in the audience is constantly coughing throughout this performance (Is it so cold in Austria at the end of May?) Bregenz Concert still remains a landmark recording in Jarrett's discography. Sometimes the amount of Jarrett's energy is so overwhelming one may get an impression he's gonna crash the piano into little pieces. This recording is not my favorite (nothing can top PARIS CONCERT) but it's undoubtedly one of the best. I wonder where did they lose MUNICH CONCERT which was originally released on a 3-LP set together with this one?
3,"Mixed: mostly outstanding, but some pieces aren't for me","Some of this is too jazzy for me; too abstract. Other parts are unbelievably awesome. This album also goes by the name of ""Bregenz Concerts"""
2,Different,"...I prefer her older music. This one is way different and doesn't have all those cool harmonies and modulations that her original/earlier music has. I say ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."""
5,Beautiful Serenity,"I was excited to finally be able to buy this CD and I wan't disappointed. I first heard it on the radio and started to look for it. Now I'm able to listen to it and the other songs with it. It is something I could put in my CD player and listen to while I sleep during the day (I'm night shift at a hospital). You may not be able to sing along with most of the music, but it is calming in my opinion."
4,Soothing,"Creates a calm working environment, eliminating stress. Practically immediate arrival to a Soldier overseas!"
1,Unmistakably Enya!,"Unmistakably Enya! So much so that I've heard it all before in her earlier albums; every track reminds me of some track of her earlier works. Lyrics are generally childish.I count myself as a big fan of Enya, but this is definitely not her best work. Not on par with ""A Day Without Rain"" or ""The Memory of Trees."" Only memorable track for me is ""Long Long Journey"" and that, probably, because it reminds me so much ""On My Way Home"" (one of my absolute favorites).Count me as disappointed."
2,One good song,"I like one song on this cd. ""It's in the Rain"" is a beautiful song. The rest sound like they were rushed to be completed in order to meet the release date.I have all of her other cds and I usually enjoy them, but this is the first one that I only like one song. Creatively, this one is missing something. She also looks silly on the cover.So far in 2005, the only artist to release a completely amazing cd is Madonna with ""Confessions on a Dance Floor."" Maybe Enya could call Madonna's producer. She needs a new sound. It's time to reinvent yourself, Enya!"
2,Disappointing....,"The REAL reason this album sucks is becuase she's singing in English. Not being able to make-up what the songs are about each time you listen & having to concentrate on the meaning just ruined the entire experience for me. Then again, I find lyrics to be the most unimportant thing in music & only listen to foreign music."
2,Utterly predictable and dull dull dull,"This is the most unispired Enya I have ever heard. Prediction - it will sell on the strength of a loyal following, but no way is there a hit on this.If you want to hear something different try Gorillaz or Fall Out Boy or Death Cab for Cutie.I know my fate already - you will say that this review was not helpful to you. Well stop by my house a karate chop with your name in it is waiting."
4,She's back!,Enya is back! Sometimes I had thought She may have drifted off into oblivion somewhere! With Amarantine She seems to be breaking out of Her long held mold and rekindling Her originality and vocal mastery.
1,Can't listen to it on my PowerBook,"It locks up the machine when I try to read this CD. Googling, I found other people with similar problems with this CD. I don't know if it is some anti-copying thing or what, but if I can't listen to it on my computer it is a showstopper, so I'm sending it back."
2,Repetitive,"The only nice piece is Amarantine.The rest of the songs are very boring and lost some of Enya's ""magic""."
3,Just a rehash of earlier stuff,The reason for the three stars is there is nothing new on this CD. They should have titled it Greatest Hits of Enya and been done with it. I'm not saying the songs are terrible; I'm just saying I already have all the music on prior CD's. Buy it if you are a first time person listening to Enya.
5,predictable...but so what?,"All of her releases have several years between them. So, disappointment is always possible, but this is typical and enjoyable stuff. My gripe that has been flirted with in some of the comments is why not put 10 to 20 minutes of alternative takes with more or fewer instruments. The studio is clearly her strong suit, and how cool it would be to hear the tracks done with less over-dubbing for instance, or even just voice. Guess it will be 2010 before the next entree, so just enjoy."
4,Standard Enya fare - short album considering the wait...,Enya continues to produce soothing music with simple Celtic-tinged melodies and New Age oriented instrumentations and production. Her latest release offers more of what Enya fans have been captivated by but the album is pretty short while the wait for it has been lengthy. The track Sumiregusa was previously released for free online after being used in an ad campaign for a major electronics company - the song is inspired by Japanese haiku. There are no surprises here but just a set of more music that maintains the Enya sound - a musical phenomenon which has enthralled listeners and generated interest in Celtic & new age music among many people who wouldn't have otherwise explored these genres. Enjoy this album and then explore other similar music while you wait for Enya to craft some more music - it may be awhile.
2,Big Disappointment,"Wow, never thought I'd write a bad review of any of Enya's work but........I'm hugely disappointed! I am also a BIG fan of her music but not this CD. The lyrics are poor and too repeatative, I find myself hitting the skip button on several tracks. I've listened to it several times but just can't warm up to but a couple of tracks. Recommend you skip this CD and dust off her older work."
2,My least favorite Enya,"Not much new here. Enya's voice is as beautiful as ever but the songs sound pretty much the same as the ones on all of her earlier recordings. The title piece, ""Amarantine,"" I find to be annoying. If I listen to this track the refrain just plays over and over in my head afterwords and drives me nuts - because its just the one word Amarantine. Over and over and over and over..... AAAAAAAAARRRGGGGG! Now when I play this CD, in the interest of my sanity, I just skip over this track."
4,Amarantine by Enya,"Amarantine is typical Enya - melodic, soothing and spiritually uplifting.Relax and enjoy the sublime sound of Enya as only she can produce"
2,Not uplifting like the rest of her work,"As usual, the composition of the pieces on this CD were done beautifully, but I was disappointed. I like everything I've heard by Enya thus far, but I hadn't listened to this CD before buying it. I found the music to be a real downer and depressing...the kind of music you put on if you need a good cry. I had hoped it would be uplifting like the rest of her CD's. Enya is very talented and everything she does is outstanding including this CD, it just wasn't the type of music I had wanted."
2,too much pop,"Enya has such a lovely voice. I have truly enjoyed her music, but this CD was a big disappointment. It seemed to stray from her roots. Enya's music has always taken me to my Celtic roots, but this CD was too much pop."
2,More of the same,"Having being a fun of Enya since her early works, I can only listen to her new CD with mixed feelings. Although it containes some really beautiful pieces, it is still way too convervative. I mostly love her darker eerier stuff, but unfortunately Enya seems to aim more to the average listener with those white, childish, and innocent songs. Years ago it was time for Enya to switch gears to something newer, so right now she sounds greatly outdated."
3,Out of new ideas,"As a long time Enya fan (starting with the ground breaking album Watermark), I found Amarantine to be a let down, as there is nothing new here that has not been heard before on her previous albums. In Amaratine it appears that Enya has finally run out of new concepts. After a long break from her last album, I was anxiously looking forward to new material along the lines of Shepard Moons or The Memory of Trees. Watch out for what you wish for, as that is what we got. This in no way diminishes the work Enya has produced to date as I still enjoy her previous albums, I simply wish that Amarantine had continued the tradition of unique surprises."
3,Not Enya's best effort but still better than most CD's out there,"I've collected everything worth having of Enya's, even a lot of her singles (that means selections with a lot of duplication which renders having ALL of her work not worth the money), and decided I had to have this album as soon as I saw it was coming out.Unusually for Enya, you don't get any Latin or Gaelic on this CD, you get three Loxian tunes (I think I've read that this made up language has some Lord of the Rings Inspiration) and one in Japanese (Sumiregusa). I think that the overall tone of the CD is somewhat slower than past efforts, it's more of a backgrond music album to my way of thinking because of this.It might not be the album for a new Enya listener to start with but established fans will find a lot to like here. I don't consider it to be Enya's best but Amarantine is much better than most CD's out there, it is worth owning. I only hope she doesn't wait 5 years for the next one."
2,Ho-Hum,"I've been a fan of Enya for quite a few years now, almost since the get go, and I must say I am rather disapointed with this album. It's not horrible, but I agree with other reviewers....there is just nothing new or exciting to make me want to keep playing it.I am suspiscious about the release of this CD because a few months supposedly Enya used the title track in a Japanese electronics commercial, the company who owned the product leaked the info that one could hear Enya's commercial song on her up-coming CD. This info was then written off on Enya's official website as a misunderstanding...no new CD was due out.And then lo and behold, not more then 5 months later the CD is released. Was this coincidence? Did she feel the need to throw something out there just so people could pick up the track heard in the commercial? I don't know. I hope not.I just hope that her next CD is adventerous and exciting and happens within the proximity of 3 years."
2,All good things...,"I'm an ardent fan, and after 5 years was distressed to find what a poor CD she released. Everyone peaks eventually, I'm just sorry it happened to one of my favourite artists. I should have waited and bought it used."
2,Disappointing,"For all that Enya has a lovely voice, this disc is surprisingly bland - it has now reached the point for me that, on the whole, Enya's more recent discs all sound the same. I commented to a friend after the first listen that it was ""more of the same,"" and it is: interchangeable, tepid songs. The only ear-catching track for me is The River Sings; at least there's some life in it. Otherwise, it's another disc of echoey, uninspiring material. And that truly is a shame, since her earlier material broke some new ground. She needs to now break out of her own self-inflicted box and stretch a bit. Lesson learned - I'll make sure to hear the disc before purchase next time, since one lively song isn't enough to make me purchase a disc."
2,Leaves much to be desired,"It seems that many would disagree with me on this, but I was very disappointed with this CD. And believe me, I absolutely love Enya! However, I still have not been able to listen to Amarantine's songs in their entirety because I find myself so irritated...not by the music itself, mind you, but by the lyrics!While Enya's music is as beautiful and moving as ever, Roma Ryan's lyric-writing skills leave much to be desired. They are extremely shoddy, cheesy, and make it seem as if she is an amateur. The only tracks I like to listen to are the opening track and the one without lyrics...the others I find to be spoiled by her bad rhymes and repetitive, boring words. I will grant that the Loxian language is nice, but that's all I can compliment Mrs. Ryan with.If you're looking for a more enjoyable Enya CD, I recommend that you look to her earlier work."
3,Not as good as previous albums,I have all Enya's albums but this one is simply not as good as any of her previous ones.
4,Enya Amarantine,I was very excited to receive the CD. It was everything I expected it to be and if needed I would purchase it all over again!
1,"""The Carpenters on valium"" says it all","Di Liberto's quip sums this up. I defy anyone to tell one Enya CD from another, and this is no exception. That said, regurgitating the same set of reverb certainly buys you a nice castle south of Dublin. Living next door to Bono hasn't done anything for her sense of adventure musically, but she knows what her public will swallow gladly.The pretentiousness of ""inventing"" a ""language"" speaks for itself. In fact, spills out volumes. Perhaps she'll have a tryst with Jon Anderson and the world will implode with the arrival of their demon child. In the meantime, I'd like to think the world has moved beyond this treacle. Not so...."
2,"A long wait for ""Enh!"" (yuk)","Now, before you other Enya fans go into defense mode, I want to say I really like her stuff and have been a fan of hers for many years.That being said...This album is a bit of a letdown after such a long wait. (Okay, a lot of a letdown.) It's...well...boring. It lacks the intricate construction, memorable melodies and harmonies that earlier albums and tracks have. Take ""To Go Beyond II"": It has almost a fairytale, magical sound to it; ""China Roses"": It has beautiful harmonies and ""softness"" in it that delight the ears; ""Long Boats"" has a feeling of power and strength in it.Sadly, ""Amarantine"" has none of that.We all know Enya can do much better. Hopefully, in the not too distant future, she'll cut a new CD where her magic will return."
4,Another lovely CD from Enya,"If you enjoy Enya's music then you will surely enjoy the lilting and lovely sound of the music on Amarantine. I did sometimes wish that it wasn't so smoothed out with synthesizers, but that is Enya's style and for the most part she uses it well.I found it fascinating that her musical partner Roma Ryan created her own language, Loxian, for several songs on the CD. It was an interesting enterprise, but apart from not being able to understand a word of the lyrics, I'm not sure it really add anything to the CD.The only complaint I have is that none of the songs really stood out from the others, so while it makes relaxing background music, it didn't really grab my attention."
5,Amazing amazing amazing!,"I am a 19 year old astrologist/tarot reader in training, but have never enjoyed New Age Music that usually accompanies such spiritual meditations. I saw a commercial for her CD on TV and decided to give it a try, and I am ever so glad I did! I turned on the music, and LITTERALLY DID NOT MOVE UNTIL THE ENTIRE CD WAS DONE - I sat there and listened to it ALL! The music is THAT amazing! Her voice is amazing, the songs are of such happiness and sorrow, absolutely amazing! I am speechless when it comes to this CD... considering I love my dance music and hiphop! I encourage ANYONE to try this CD, you will love it!"
5,One song is worth price of admission,"IF I COULD BE WHERE YOU AREIf you have ever lost someone and if you can appreciate an angelic voice, then this album is worth it for this song alone, the entire album is very good, its not enya's best, that title belongs to Shepard moons, but this is still a very good album. IF I COULD BE WHERE YOU ARE might very well be her best ballad ever, hard to say, but I fell in love with it. I am nearly afraid to share it with some friends of mine who would never otherwise hear it. The song will make you want to break down, if you have a soul. Music that has that sort of impact on people is powerful, and should be cherished, as should this album."
5,Enya Supreme,"While occasionaly criticied for the ""sameness"" of her sound, when it is this good, why not? There is not the duplication one finds on several of her other CDs. All new...all good. A gifted voice for all to enjoy. Easy listening."
1,Disappointed,"We have almost all of Enyas CD's and listen to them almost religiously for relaxation. Looked forward to a new one. We pre ordered, it came and...Talk about non-triditional...It's boring...for lack of a better word. With the talent she has, what a terrible waste. Maybe I'm too old fashion, but making up a language along the way just to get the sounds..... In one cut the same sounds, (as they are not words) are repeated so many times I thought the CD player was stuck. I got up and gave it a wack. Well thanks for ""Paint the Sky"", ""The Celts"", ""Trees"", and the others. This one is disappointing, wish I had kept the money. Hugh and Dee"
5,Review of Purchase,"Enya is my favorite. Her music for me is better than Prosac, it's very calming. I listen to it all the time."
5,Wonderful!,"This is a CD that has stayed in my player for several days. It is refreshing, calming, and uplifting. Enya's style has you excited, but is relaxing enough to face another drudging day. This CD is infused with Celtic-style chants which provide a haunting harmony. The way her voice fluctuates provides almost a visual melody. I have several of her works, but I believe this to be the best thus far."
4,Very nice.,"I have to say that I'm not surprised that they chose this for the first single because it does have that mainstream appeal, although it wouldn't have been my first choice (I would have to say It's In The Rain or Less Than A Pearl should have been, simply because I love those) Not to criticize Amarantine at all, it's one of my favorite tracks on the album. Moving on to Comb of the Winds, this makes the single all worth the purchase. It's such a beautiful piece, one of the best instrumentals given to us by Enya in my opinion. The Spaghetti Western wasn't really my cup of tea. I would say add this to your collection, it's worth it."
4,A day without rain vs Amarantine.,"I am a bit disappointed about this cd. I was very anxious because i wanted to listen to a new enya's cd. Today, i listened to it and i discovered that something is missing.I dont know what is it, but it misses. Maybe, there are no the rythms of some well known songs as Orinoco Flows or Anywhere is.I loved some songs as ""Amarantine"", ""Less a pearl"" (Excuse me if i dont remember very well the songs.),and other.But if i had to choose between ""A day without rain"" and ""Amarantine"", i would prefer the first one."
2,Not her best...,"To be perfectly honest, I didn't like Amarantine very much, only a little, whereas I love her other albums. This is definitely not her best, and five years is too long to wait for a rather disappointing album. The songs are reminiscent (I do no want to use the word ""rehashed"") of her older -and better- ones. One example is ""Someone Said Goodbye"" which is very similar in theme and rythm to ""One by One"" in ""A Day Without Rain"". Buy it only if you're a die-hard Enya fan, but if you're new to her music, try her master-pieces, Watermark, The Memory of Trees, and The Celts."
3,I miss the old style...,"Yes, I know all artists grow and change, and I am still a devoted Enya fan. But i have to confess, I like her earlier work much more. I'm a little bothered by the sing-songy trend I see emerging in her work. I'm not getting the powerful, larger than life images in my mind like i did with her first three CD's. This comes across more as Enya Lite. give me the old style, massive sound I fell in love with years ago."
4,Something for everyone.,"A mix of Loxian and English tunes. For the ENYA fan -- she is marvelous. For my hubby(who is into fantasy games)the Loxian tunes are a mood setter. And with a Christmas bonus to boot, you can be year round happy with this purchase."
4,Amazing Music,"This was the first Enya CD I bought. I have always loved the music from the movie ""Titanic"" and remember someone saying to check out Enya if you like the music from ""Titanic"". I was in Florida visting my friend and decided to try and find one of her CDs. I listened to this all the way home. This CD is great. My favorites are Less Then a Pearl, It's In The Rain, The River Sings and Amarantine. A few days later I got A Day Without Rain and I loved that too. I also got Paint the Sky With Stars. Enya's voice is just beautiful. I really would recommend this CD, esp if you enjoyed the ""Titanic"" music."
4,Ancient History,"I agree with the other reviewer that other books in simpler language might be better than this one. However, if one can overlook the ancient prose, this is a terrific historical find. As one who didn't know anything about Stuart England, I learned a lot from this and enjoyed how completely it covers the period. This is a good basis for English history."
4,Glad I Found This One,"I had heard the title cut and ""Your Eyes"" from this cd a few years ago and I really liked them. Being hard to come by I was forced to buy the cd used and am I glad I did. Dave plays tenor and soprano sax as well as the flute and is joined on most songs by Peter White. On ""Your Eyes"" Dave plays the flute with Peter White on guitar. This one is excellent. The second track ""Nightfall"" features tenor sax, flute, guitar and keyboards and is equally as good. The next great track is track 6 ""Losing You"" and features tenor sax. Finally the last one that I really enjoy alot is track 10 ""Party of Two"" , which features the flute. While this one is only available used today, these songs make this cd a good buy."
4,All questions answered,"Anybody who likes anything by Lauren Hill, Erika Badu or Ms. Dynamite needs to pick up this CD. Smooth vocals and tracks to go along with above average lyrical skills. Question touches everybody with this CD. Young or old, this CD is a must buy."
2,Umm why,"Ok this movie will utterly make u mad at the end !!! It had some real good potential , father and mother have a son that was killed by someone , they track him down after he's been arrested and when the killer is being moved the cou"
4,Jesse is all grown up!,What happened to that nice sexy boy toy in Desperate Housewives? He is all grown up and able to torment someone to the point where I had to cover my eyes a few times. The movie is quite good for this type of low budget thriller. A twist ending that you can predict quite easily. Very watchable but be prepared for all the graphic torture.
2,Sigh,"this would have been a much, much, much better movie without the twist ending. A mother and father want to punish the serial killer who tortured and killed their son. Honestly, who wouldn't sympathize with that? So Mom and Dad kidnap the killer while he is being transported to a prison and lock him up in a empty cabin's basement and torture him.This is not easy for them, as they are not evil like the serial killer is, the mother especially has a hard time sometimes. Makes sense. Realistically done. Super.However, the twist ending blew everything out of the water. Now, there is not necessarily anything wrong with twist endings, as long as they are delivered and executed well and enhance the plot. In this case, it did NOT happen. It only ruined the movie and completely cheapened the story."
3,"Not Great, But Not Bad at All","This movie won't win any awards any time soon, but was definitely worth the $1.20 at Redbox. Like someone stated earlier, the story could have been developed a little more but it was a nice little twist at the end; although somewhat predictable. The way they put the ending together definitely reminds you of the Saw series. I wouldn't watch it again, but it's still a good watch and your time won't be wasted by it."
3,The Tortured,"This is a pretty intense movie. The biggest complaint I have is I believe I have seen at least one of two very very similar versions that play on the same theme and evetual outcome. The best part of the film is the acting by the two main actors: the husband and wife, well done convincing job. As I said, the plot has been done before and was predictable."
4,"Halfway through, will update when finished","I have to keep stopping this movie, taking a breath and then resuming it. my daughter watched it last night and said i had to see it. so far i will give it 4 stars just for the fact that i can not remember the last time a movie actually had me holding my breath like this!"
3,Book recieved late,It took so long to get it. My class only had 2 classes left.I didn't need this anymore.Linda Morgan
4,Just what I needed,"It was much cheaper than anywhere else, by nearly $70. The book itself if extremely handy for teaching school students vital sports skills. Would definitely recommend it."
1,Never got my Item!,"Never got a tracking number, contacted the seller three weeks after my order and they were of no help to me! I had to buy the book somewhere else! The seller took days to contact me back and most of the time never contacted me at all! I would NEVER buy from this seller again I am extremely dissapointed.."
4,"Easy to use, but not strong enough for some tasks","I purchased this along with the ATG dispenser primarily for use in mounting flat paper for stationery projects. However, the first project I tackled with it was a set of paper chains (like elementary school students make) made with glittery scrapbook paper. The chains went together easily and quickly, but almost as soon as I hung them, the links started to pop open. I have mended them twice, but they continue to come unglued. It could be due to the tension on the chains or to the glittery surface on the paper, but there is clearly a limit to the power of this adhesive."
2,Had to return...,"I had ordered these boots in the black leather in a size 10. Much to my surprise, they were too small; more like a 9 1/2. I have other Nine West boots and shoes so it was out of the ordinary for these not to fit. Plus, the leather did not look like good quality, more like man made materials. Unfortunately, I had to return them."
1,Don't recommend,I don't recommend a friend this product. It's a very poor quality. 0 satisfaction for the client.
3,"Pretty Good but silly, too","I like the ideas and the setting but the characters are so stiff-backed and awkward. I was cringing through all the dialogue. Nonetheless, I was able to enjoy this book and the others because it moves at a good pace."
5,This Can't Be the Last Chronicle!,"One more, Jack, and the story will be done. This journey has been too, too good for you to stop it at numero VI. Please - give us a VII."
3,This book is not up to par with the series...,"I have read with great enjoyment the other books in this series and I was really looking forward to reading ""The Sorcerer"" but boy...it is sadly lacking what Whyte put into the other books in this series. I had a hard time forcing myself to read this one because it is so slow moving and just plain boring. It seems as if Whyte lost his train of thought here or was himself bored with the telling of the Camulod tale. Either way, his editor needs a kick in the rear for letting this one be published as is.For those who are reading the series and haven't yet gotten to this one I do suggest you read it just to keep following the story to the end but I finally resorted to skiming paragraphs/pages just to get through the really boring parts.Very disappointing this book is."
4,"Well, I like it!","I may only be 14 but I've read all these books and I like them all. Few writers describe the human body in a real believeable way, and Mr. Whyte sure does. This last one is no exception. My only problem is that this latest one was slower than the others and people think out loud too much. The earlier ones were lustier and had more fighting."
3,What happened to Jack Whyte?,"I loved the first four books of Whyte's Camulod Chronicles, but apparently he lost his way in Fort At River's Bend (book 5). Now in Sorcerer, he has recovered quite a bit, but still fails to hold a candle to his previous works.Finally, Whyte resolves dozens of our expectations and dangling questions. Certain characters have died, as we knew they must. Camulod is becoming less Roman, and more like the Arthurian Britain we all know. Merlin has now become the sorcerer, and Arthur has pulled the sword from the stone and become King of all Britain.Unfortunately, the manner in which he did all this... left me far from impressed. While Whyte had spent immense detail on every little meaningless event in previous books, he then chaotically rushed through these MAIN events we have been waiting for since The Skystone.It's a shame, but after six books- I am no longer interested in how this series will turn out."
1,Worhtless,I rate the product as worhtless because I did not need the weights for the camera case that I purchased. I went diving 130ft deep and the weights were never needed for for the camera. I would like to return the weights since I have not used them and they are basically worthless to me.
3,Three Stars,"Works great at keeping camera neutrally buoyant, but the screws that hold the weights to the camera come loose easily. I lost the weight set within a week, after tightening them several times."
2,Don't waste your money,I want to share a thought I wish someone had given me before I bought this. First off you don't need any weights to use this camera while scuba diving; second the screw for these weights to be attached to the camera is no good as it is not long and tight enough and does not lock down very well resulting in me losing the weights the first time I used them. It was a complete wsate of money.
3,Canon Camera Weights,Weights did the job but did not need but two of the four weights. Thumb screw that hold weights in place tends to work loose. Needs lock washer.
2,Boring drama,"Linda Carol plays the wife of a pudgy lawyer who shows no interest at all in his sexy wife. She decides to turn the tables by having an affair with mysterious, seductive photographer Martin Hewitt. Before too long, this heated affair is not what it seems, as Hewitt appears to have a dark side which could lead to a fatal conclusion. Stiff acting, horrible writing, and contrived directing all add up to one extremely boring flick. While the film does feature rather hot sex scenes (most films of this sort do), it can not compensate for much else. Julie Strain is featured in a 5 minute cameo in a Japanese restaurant bathroom, coupled with Hewitt in a rather graphic, yet amazingly hot sex scene--which earns this film its second star. Otherwise, skip it."
2,Merely pseudo-sophisto background noodling,"2 1/2Undercooked electronic experimentation pales in comparison to artist's more beat-driven, thoughtfully layered Prefuse 73. Here, Heron just lazily equates scatter-shot noise, mediocre, redundantly annoying Spanish vocals, and very little semblance of melody with something cutting-edge. It is not. Although the disc does work best inside pocket moments of inspired fusion, on a whole it is a lackluster release, hardly justified buying for anyone but devout fans."
2,gooey,I approached this album with great hopes of sinking my teeth into some great Catalan folk music. But i was disappointed. I listened some more but i was still disappointed. This album rarely resolves into something that doesn't sound like a yellow/grey goo.The vocals are (vaguely) pretty but too breathy and indistinct for much emotion to be carried. And the music sounds like it has been pulped and reconstituted resulting in bland characterless sound. There is some interesting subtleties - the gentle drum pattering can be engaging.Overall though an underwhelming experience.
3,Leaves a little to be desired.,"This product worked well enough on a recent project that the customer was quite satisfied with the result. On the flip side, since this item will only apply pre-glued, hot melt adhesive product, I'm finding the usefulness limited to white, black or unfinished birch edgeband. If there were more variations of edgeband compatible with this machine, would definitely rate 4 stars, possibly 5 stars. Since I can't seem to find anything other pre-glued edgeband, I find it's use limited."
4,CHILDREN LIKE TO PLAY A PART,"The youngest readers are often attracted to books with which they can play a part - be it a lift-the-flap book, a puzzle book, or, in this case, a sticker book.With 32 bold colored stickers youngsters can play a matching game as either they are read to or they read aloud.Interacting with a book is a positive experience for children, plus these colorful stickers are reusable. So, the fun doesn't end."
5,A BOOK EVERY JEW SHOULD READ,IN THIS BOOK THE LEADER OF WORLD JEWRY SETS DOWN THE GUIDELINES OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A JEW IN TODAYS WORLD. AS ALWAYS RABBI KAHANE WRITES NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH IN THIS BOOK. THE RABBIS WRITINGS ARE SIMILAR TO THE WRITINGS OF THE PROPHETS IN THE BIBLE. THIS BOOK WILL SURELY MAKE THE KAPOS IN THE US JEWISH AND ISRAELI ESTABLISHMENT CRINGE WITH EMBARRASSMENT. AFTER READING THIS BOOK THE READER WILL BE LEFT WITH A FEELING OF AWE FOR THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS A FEELING OF ANGER TOWARDS THOSE IN THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT AND THE MOSSAD THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR KAHANES MURDER. AM YISROEL CHAI!
2,Buyer Beware,"Pan cracked on third use at medium to low heat, Chef Mario makes a lot of money selling a useless product which he has to know about, thank you Chef con Mario."
3,Good guide to complement your research,"This guide is to complement your research to plan a trip, not as a main source of information.It provides good and useful information for people who are not on a budget.I crossed the hotel tips with Tripadvisor and the recommendations are really goods.This is not recommended for the budget traveler."
2,not worth the price,Cheap little foldout card in very small print that is hard to read. The free stuff found in Hotels is better.
5,do or die is da shit,"do or die is 1 of my favorite groups of all time they are great and very underated.this cd is great not as good as picture this but still great. every song is either good or great. the best song, i think, is either higher, or chain of command, the beats are crazy."
3,Picture this was better,"First Do Or Die cd i ever heard was ""Picture This"", then ""Headz or Tailz"", so i got some catching up to do with buying more of their albums. So far my fave still remains ""Picture This"" because of ""6 Million"" but this album was okay. i liked ""Chain of Command"" the best, also ""Higher"" (not the remix version), and hearing a remake or remix of ""Wa Da Da Dang"" was cool.I've heard better though, but i look forward to hearing more."
2,This Cd is probably Do or Die's only lame cd,Do Or Die is my favorite rappers I own all of their cds out of all of them this one is the only dissappointment the left rap alot records which they made 5 other cds on and they were very very good and joind leagion records i dont know if its the record label or what but it aint hardcore like the other ones the only songs i liked were chain of command(track 3) and for the block (track 17) other then that the whole Cd is pretty soft
1,Cant Compare to Earlier Albums,"The album has a couple good songs- higher with kanye west which has already been on the radio in chi town- but more importantly if you liked their earlier albums you will be let down. Songs like ""nobody's home"" just are not on this album....i like do or die- but dod did not do it for me..."
1,Boo,"I reely like Do or Die, they are probably my favorate rap group, but Kanye West has ruined this cd. I have already heard all of these songs like 20 years ago, and I like the original versions. I always thought do or die had more creative songs then most rap groups, but this cd is not original at all."
2,Not good at all !,"This is the 2nd worst Do or Die album out there today.I think DOD should do more single hits with Twista & Kanye West.D.O.D. just doesn't have what it takes to put together a great 15 track album.Terrible album ,I chucked it out my car window really fast.People look out for Twista's new album by Atlantic Records ""Day After""."
3,Elated,"Glad to see the boys back on the scene....My favorite song is Magic Chick and it's probably because of R. Kelly, but they did a good job too. Also, anything with kanye West is on lock. Keep up the good work. STAY BLESSED!!!!"
5,"""I Was There""--But Jim Bishop Took Me Back","Jim Bishop is an outstanding writer and his format using hours of the day (i.e., 7:00 am, 8:00 am, etc.) took you to where everyone was at that time--Lee, JFK, the FBI Agent responsibile for Oswald, Jackie, the football, Ruby, etc,. His research was in-depth and made you never question its validity. I lived in Dallas when this event took place, but was too young to know what was happening. Jim Bishop took back to Dallas on that day and gave me more than I ever expected to receive from the book. This book will make you feel like a history buff. His excellent writing ability led me to purchase another of his books--""The Day Lincoln was Shot""--This one is ""Ditto""."
4,Was forced to read this but ended up enjoying it anyways,"This book was an AP U.S. History assignment and it terrified me because I had less than a week to read it. Fortunately, the book is a quick read and the 700 pages went by pretty fast. If you do not like history, this probably isn't the book for you for obvious reasons.To sum it up, its well written, but could have been half the length (the beginning and end drags a bit) and just as informative."
4,Whittaker & Watson,Classic text. Good encyclopedic source of mathematics - pure & applied. Definitely not a picture book and takes a bit of digging to find what one needs. Typical abbreviated index found in British texts of that era.
3,unexpected,"1- The book is not printed. They have taken pictures of the original book (1920s?) and printed the pictures.The result is tiny fonts and a quite old pagination style.2- Some people may like the no-frills and matter-of-fact text but I personally find an endless list of dry-to-the-bone mathematical facts a little bit stifling. And, yes, I know that this is a mathematical book, but it doesn't have to be this airless.3- As far as I can tell there is an error in the first line at page 12. I haven't read much more and so I cannot vouch for the rest of the book.All in all, I wouldn't recommend it and I wouldn't have bought it had I had a chance of looking at it first"
5,Get it!,"This is a truly great album, or rather it's two great albums. The second CD, containing live versions of tracks from both 'In The Red' and previous albums is mesmirising.. I probably listen to it more than I do the studio album, and I listen to that quite a bit.Tina Dico has an amazing voice and a fantastic way with melody and heart-felt lyricism that grabs hold of you. If you've not heard her work before I strongly recommend you test a couple of tracks and then just bite the bullet and get the album.Here in Australia, virtually nobody has heard of Miss Dico, but I'm doing my best to alert people to her talent; get on board now!"
5,One of my favorite albums,"This singer/songer writer, Tina Dico (Tina Dickow in Danish) is absolutely fantastic. I bought the album because I knew three of the songs and I knew I liked them. But the more I listen to them the more I like them, and now I love them... The whole album is great!"
1,oh my god I can't believe what I'm hearing,"Words can't describe how upset I am after listening to this album. As a huge ratm fan it hurts me that people let these amature attempts of copying one of the most influential bands of the decade. I wouldn't mind if they made a good job of it but this is ambarresses me so God only knows how Rage feel about it. For a start no-one can play the riffs as well as tom morello, so why try. Why not try and change a little or something. Zack's voice is completly unique and trying to mimic it is almost impossible. I donnot recommend this album to anyone who knows the quality of rage, and am very dissapionted with this outcome. What sort of record company lets these underbreeds into the studio. I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT A STAR BUT HAD NO CHOICE"
1,horrible cover,Well RATM is an awesome band and are really hard to cover. I give them that. But my god if your going to cover them please make it better than this. this cd is a HUGE disapointment.
1,A bad tribute to one of the greatest bands in the world.,"Rage Against the Machine are an awesome band. They are a very powerful band, with powerful lyrics and a powerful sound. So you would think they might get a good tribute, right? Nope, they don't. What they get is a horrible tribute by ameteurs(who the hell are the 'Renegadez of Funk?'). They are some rock band. But why don't they mix up different styles of music to Rage Against the Machine songs? Like some punk, rap... Anything that will be a little interesting that this garbage. Some of the songs on here are not even Rage Against the Machine songs. Yeah, they were on the 'Renegades' album, but those were only covers of songs from Rage Against the Machine's favorite artists and songs. Maybe if a LOT more effort was put into this it would be worth buying... or at least useful. Instead, its a worthless tribute that will be forgotten in time(even though its practically forgotten now...)."
1,This doesnt do rage credit,"The Cd is a disgrace, I almost laughed out lad at the singers voice. If youre in need of a few laughs then buy this- if you like music by any rage album! This CD doesnt deserve a star. The music doesnt compare to rage at all."
1,why? just why?,please stop these foos from killing it in the name of Rage Against The Machine...please.
1,interesting,"I just heard about this cd last night, and I was very interested in hearing the clips. Once I did, I realized how important it is to cover Rage and have a guitar player who can figure out the sounds and a singer that sounds like Zack. The singer on those clips had no energy and didn't sound like Zack at all. That ruined it for me because the music actually sounded really close to the real thing. I don't understand why they'd have a tribute cd and try to sound exactly like the band when we can just go buy the albums of the real band."
5,The Investors' Guide to Enron,Let me start by admitting that I lost a tidy sum of money in the whole Enron disaster and would be happy never to see that word again. Then I saw Richard Pachter's rave review of this book in the Miami Herald and figured that maybe I could learn something from reading it. I had no idea of some of the things that Enron up to (criminal problems as far back as the 1980s) and the authors do an excellent job of fitting all the pieces together. I only wish that someone could for once write a book like this before disaster strikes.
2,What went wrong at Enron,"The book was thrown together. The author wanted to be a first mover in the marketplace that analyzed what went wrong at Enron. However, the author neglected to mention in detail and explain how off balance sheet special purpose entities were Enron's demise. This is a waste of time and money to read."
2,Lacking substance,"I suppose this book provides a decent overview of what happened at Enron (this could be accomplished in much less than the 150 large print small pages it takes the authors), but the complete lack of depth left me feeling a little like I might after reading the box score of a baseball game.I rather suspect the primary reason for the lack of depth in this book is a desire to get it in print as soon as possible. I do not recommend this book for anyone who really wants to understand what happened at Enron."
1,"boring, boring, boring","Some have called this book a ""basic guide"" for the Enron mess. I would call it a basic guide for falling asleep. I worked at Enron, and there is nothing more annoying than self-proclaimed experts trying to explain the ins-and-outs of a company from the outside. It's about as accurate and useful as a binder-ful of news clippings. This book fails to capture the spirit of Enron, and fails to capture the essence of what really went wrong. I hope some better books come along, because the quick-and-dirty paperback version here was a waste of time and money."
5,The Scoop - All In One Place!,It's good to have all the details (and the gossip) all in one easy to read (and easy to carry) book. I found it both insightful and thorough.
5,Excellent book,"Mastering Blocking And Stuttering: A Cognitive Approach to Achieving FluencyI have long silently rated Bob Bodenhammer's work and this book when I found it last year was a joy. Written in Bob's professional and well practised manner, it not only looks at and discusses, blocking and stuttering, it also provides useful and appropriate solutions. Using the skills of Neuro Linguistic Programming to help reprogram thoughts and actions, even those well hidden ones it leads the user to a profound and lasting change. (I think only for use by the consummate professional to make the changes postively permanent). And still a useful book to indicate to the lay person how changes may be made."
4,Very Informative and Helpful,"For anyone who searches to resolve the mysterious of stuttering, this is a must read. Bob has certainly discovered and reveals much of the mystery."
5,Sopranino Recorder,I bought an inexpensive (read cheap) Sopranino Recorder some time ago and could never get the upper register of notes to work right. This one works. I actually enjoy playing it rather than feel that it is a needed chore.
4,Wonderful for a plastic recorder,"As has been pointed out by the other reviewers, this is just short of a professional instrument. No, Bernard Krainis would not play this instrument, but then, Julian Bream would not play a Fender guitar, either. For the price and what it is, this is a very nice little instrument, though. It is superior to the somewhat cheaper versions of Yamaha plastic sopranino recorder, the YRN-22B, in that this has a somewhat mellower sound. Let's face it, though, sopranino recorder is somewhat shrill, even if it's a $400 version. For the money, you can't beat this little instrument. If you want a professional version, then spend the money on a cherry wood sopranino or buy one in a $500 set. For what is it, this is a sweet instrument."
5,Great little addition to my recorder collection!,"Once I became accustomed to the little teeny spacing, I decided that this was the coolest thing I've bought all week. The notes are clear (and piercing!), and the tone is very nice. I especially like the lower register (""low"" being a relative term!). Buy with confidence and have fun. Shipping was very quick."
4,A film that will outlast many others,"It's almost 2003 and there's still no DVD. It's about time.Except, perhaps, for his opening monologue, DeVito doesn't put a foot wrong. However, if the film was missing any of it's essential elements (Jewison, DeVito or Miller) it would have fallen hard. As it is, it's thought provoking fun right through. (But it would be more fun on DVD.)"
4,vintage DeVito,"This is a great film for DeVito fans, but a better film for people who want a less than perfect romantic comedy.The lead character is a greedy businessman with maybe two redeeming qualities, who's in love with a beautiful lawyer. The two are at odds because the company he wants to liquidate belongs to her stepfather.DeVito plays the villian as great as always, while also doing a good job of showing his 'sensitive side'. This is a great film for a lazy afternoon, or a time when you're in the mood for a less than perfect romance. Give this overlooked film a try!"
3,A cheesy little comedy...,"... but DeVito's speech at the shareholder's meeting was required viewing in one of my MBA classes. The movie can be a good primer on hostile takeovers, how and why they are done. The sugar-sweet happy ending was a let-down (I guess I'm a greedy uncaring goob), but the lessons of the movie weren't lost."
2,Larry Garfield is compared to?,When Danny Devito's plays Larry Garfield he is like Taxi's Louie De Palma of Wall Street.
4,"Another Meaning for the Phrase ""Other People's Money""","A cute little romantic comedy, which DeVito surprisingly carries off very well as a male lead. The real surprise, however, is the honesty in the writing -- instead of the usual casting of corporate raider as archvillain, it FINALLY gets pointed out that Peck's character DOESN'T own the company -- he's just managing it for the stockholders (something most viewers don't seem to understand). A nice little clear insight into another facet of capitalism, on top of a cute romance, with a lot of snappy dialog. Well worth adding to your video collection, especially if you're a DeVito fan."
3,it was ok,"The quality of the film was great. The film itself was ok. Not great, not horrible. I wouldn't watch it again. Danny Devito is funny."
4,Cute Story Especially for Girls,"This is a great story for girls (and boys) because it tells the story of a girl who follows her dream regardless of what the people around her say. Jane perservered even though she was told ""girls can't be knights"". The story is told lightly and the drawings are sweet."
4,More than a Cookbook,This is the cookbook for those who are just starting to cook. The explaination ofwhat pan or dish to use for each dish is a helpful tool. I wish I had had thisbefore now.
4,More Info...,"1/4"" radius cove. It's a mystery why the most important spec was omitted from the description!"
5,SIMMONS DOES IT AGAIN!!!,"If Holden Caulfield sired a love child on Nancy Drew while Huck Finn looked on, the result would be Evan Macalister, hero of FINDING LUBCHENKO. Who IS Lubchenko? Who wants to find him? Evan? How come? For answers to these questions, and others, you must read FINDING LUBCHENKO."
3,Fun mystery novel,"I wasn't expecting much from the book and it turned out to be a fun mystery novel. It is a traditional whodunnit, and is fun to read. The story is a bit predictable but Mr. Hall still makes the tale interesting, and the main character Stanely Hastings, is well-developed. Hall also throws in a fair share of witty, humourous lines that gives the reader plenty of opportunity to smile and laugh while reading the story."
3,Works well before it breaks down,"I bought this because I read great reviews about it and horrible ones about the zune specific monster fm transmitter. When I got it, it was very easy to set up and the quality was much higher than I expected. I was very satisfied for about a year until it started to break. The audio would cut in and out and would only play if i positioned the cable (near the transmitter part) in a certain way. After some time of ghett-rigging it, the audio cut out completely. Since it lasted a full year and worked well I bought a new one this summer. After only 2-3 months of having it, I'm already having the same problem with the audio cutting out or only playing on one side.While I usually love monster, I think it may be time to look for a new transmitter."
3,Wow,"Wow, amazing how these three people all gave such favorable reviews to a product that isn't even released yet."
5,It works It really works,I just got this today at target. I was very skeptic before I bought it because the Microsoft Zune Fm Transmitter is just God awful. I mean I could never really get a good reception there was always static with the microsoft transmitter.The monster Fm transmitter you can get a good signal without any static at all on all the FM stations.I only wish that the Monster Transmitter was able to charge your Zune because I only have one cigarette lighter in my car. I mean I did pay $60 for it.Why shouldn't it be able to charge and play music at the same time.Overall I do recommend it.
3,"Works well when it does work, but doesn't last long.",The setup and use of this FM transmitter was quick and painless. It did work well but after a few months the connector went bad. You could 'jiggle it' to get sound out of it but for what it cost you shouldn't need to do that. I bought the Scosche unit from Amazon and it's been performing just as well as the Monster - I hope this one lasts! The cord isn't as long but its long enough to do the job for my vehicle. I'd give a 5 to the Monster for its function but a 1 for reliability.
2,Not a Good DVD for a beginner,"I purchased this DVD upon advise from my physician that Yoga could help with chronic back pain. The title read ""Yoga DVD for Beginners, seniors...."" and that coupled with the price made it an attractive product for me. I must say that after I loaded it and began the routine, I quickly found that this was not for a beginner! The instructor does not start by first giving an overview of the upcoming routine - this made it very difficult to follow, especially when you are in an inverted position and must look up at the screen to determine the next move/position. I wrote this review as a precautionary statement to others looking for a beginners series - keep looking! I'm sure a seasoned Yoga student will find this workout beneficial & refreshing!"
1,The maker of this video should be sued!,"This DVD is most definitely NOT for seniors, people with arthritis and sciatica or beginners. I tried to keep up with the instructor on this DVD, and a month later I am still having severe back pain. I've been to 2 Urgent care clinics and now I have to follow up with my primary care doctor. I'm sure I'll have to have an MRI and may be referred to a back specialist. I have never been in so much pain in my life!"
2,not for beginners,"i am not a yoga master but i've gone to enough classes to understand the basic techniques. i would not call this a beginners dvd. they go through some pretty tough poses! also i didn't really like that it moved through each pose only once. i prefer to go through sequences of poses at least a couple of times. and each pose isn't held that long either. if people are looking for affordable yoga videos i would recommend myyogaonline. you can download videos for a reasonable price or become a monthly member for only $10 a month and stream as many dvd's as you like. they have a ton of videos with different instructors, different venues, different types of yoga, etc. overall if i had my choice i would buy a different dvd for a beginning level"
5,A Captivating Concert,"This is a wonderful 90 minute tape featuring Johnny Mathis in concert. The orchestra is incredible, Mathis' music and voice are extraordinary. Having just seen Mathis in Las Vegas this past November, this VHS tape brilliantly captures the magic of a live performance and more. There are personal commentaries by Mathis about his songs, edited into segments of the concert. This is one tape that won't just ""sit on the shelf."""
4,An adventure classic,"I read this as historical research but quickly fell in love with it as a work of literature. There's a lot of first-we-did-this and then-we-did-that, but when Whymper moves away from chronological reporting, he shows himself to be one hell of a good writer. His conquest of the Matterhorn and the tragedy that quickly followed give the book its emotional core. If you like adventure stories, I don't know how you don't love this."
4,Spatula,"Great material, doesn't scratch. It is the perfect length, but a VERY narrow spatula end itself. Wish it was average size."
5,"nice, thin spatula",I was looking for a thin spatula that wouldn't warp to use with my non-stick pans. I have a couple of OXO ones that I love but they end up bending. This one is sturdy and is thin so I can easily turn crepes and pancakes.
1,"NetGear: unreliable, bad support & performance","I've owned a variety of NetGear units over the last five years, mostly stuff given to me, bought cheaply at sell-outs, and left over from dot-bomb company crashes.I keep using them because I have four of the same units I didn't pay for, and I only have three connections hooked to them. I gave up dealing w/their support years ago.Once or twice a year the unit and/or the power supply burns out, and I recycle the unit at a local company. When I run out of units or power supplies, I'll be done with NetGear and will avoid them completely in the future.The Linksys router I have sitting next to it is four years old and still running without any downtime."
4,A gift I wish I'd kept for myself,"A lot of class for glass jewelry, shipped extremely quickly and arrived in perfect condition - the picture didn't do it justice. Remarkably inexpensive for the quality - next time, I would order two, one for me."
3,Frankie and Johnny by Pfeiffer and Pacino,"Same story with this as with ""Last Picture Show"" purchase. Good movie seen a long time ago, good cast - REALLY good cast - wanted to see it again. Format not advertised, dvd purchased but my player couldn't play it, so another waste of my money."
1,Read carefully before you purchase from Amazon - see below comments,"I was upset with this Amazon purchase because when I played the movie (Frankie & Johnny, Michele Pfeiffer & Al Pacino) it said ' this disc may not be played in your region 'well, little did I know that the movie I purchased was in Swedish. How could that happen? Can you tell me Amazon where I can purchase this movie in English. I don't need to review the movie because I have seen it before and loved it..that is why I wanted to purchase it..so I could watch it again and loan it to friends. It was not a big hit movie and it is very hard to find. It is a movie from the 1980's.Beware Amazon purchasers - read carefully before you purchase - read the fine print.Patricia"
3,super delayed,"you should consider paying a better shipping, i took the normal shipping, and it took A MONTH to get to arizona from i dont know where.. maybe china on ground shipping.. haha this shipping is so cheap, avoid this one, or buy the extra shipping that maybe would take 3 weeks. :(too bad this took so long amonth, anyways the movie is in new condition and no problems at all, just the super extra long delivery time... bad bad bad"
4,Great Romance Movie,"I think that Michelle Pfeiffer is an incredible actress and portratys her character very well in this movie. It is a good story with lots of emotional tension. It's very well-directed, well-acted, and is quite entertaining to watch. I personally enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it for anyone who loves Romantic movies set in New York! (Aren't they all?)"
1,DVD was not playable.,"Apparently, different countries have different codes in a DVD player. I thought all DVDs were the same. I was so excited to get the movie, but so disappointed I could not play it. It would've cost the price of the movie just to ship it back, so I just had to throw it out. That was a waste of money."
4,Frankie and Johnny,"Frankie and Johnny was, well, different. When one begins the film, one first thinks that Frankie and Johnny will be a formula love story. Well it is in some sense, but is also is not. Frankie and Johnny is much more complex than it first appears to be. Frankie, having gone through an abusive relationship, must overcome her fear of an intimate relationship. Johnny on the other hand, must overcome his problem with lonliness. Through cooking, Johnny has found a start out of his dilemma. His goal in this movie, is to help Frankie find her own start. We can see Johnny's influence on Frankie, in how she encourages him to see his children who he has not seen in three years. It is how Frankie and Johnny find their ""start"" which makes Frankie and Johnny a successfull movie."
4,Fun Game but not always factual,"OK so here's the deal. Most trivia games favor those who are knowledgeable. This one does but to a much lesser extent. Many of the questions are written in a manner that leaves you asking "" well it must be true or why would they even have a question like that?"". others have rediculously easy answers that would lead you to believe they are too obvious to be right.. ""where would you go to catch a McFish?"" badapapapa I'm loving it...haha. you'll enjoy this game if you and those others playing it realize that you're going to be fooled by wrong answers or strange questions occasionally and miss questions whose answers are stupidly easy. the game has a nice board and plays very similar to trivial pursuit. all in all it makes for an enjoyable time but if you're really about the trivia part be prepared to be let down semi-regularly by the questions."
4,"It's good, not great. About right for the price.","This sharpener is good, not great, but probably right for the price. I sharpened a bunch of pencils in a row (we homeschool) and it ran smoothly about 90% of the time. There were a few clunky starts, nothing dramatic but not perfect. Also, and this is the reason for the lack of stars; the drawer is a bit of a pain. When you sharpen, of course there are shavings in the small drawer which is accessible right on the front, below the hole. Well, when you go to put the drawer back in, it's a tiny bit of a struggle. There is a small plastic `tube' or offshoot in the back of the drawer and you have to line it up with a hole inside the machine. Because the drawer is a rather cheap plastic, as is the tube/offshoot, I had the feeling it would break if I let my kids use it. Decent length cord, about as noisy as any X-Acto electric sharpener."
4,pencil sharpener,"As a classroom teacher I needed a pencil sharpener that was easy for students to use, made minimal noise when in use, and did the job! This sharpener met all my criteria and I am very pleased I purchased it."
4,Great for the Classroom,"My wife uses this in her 4th Grade classroom. So far, the sharpener has worked as advertised. Time will tell how it holds up."
3,X-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener (1818),"This sharpener sounds like its made with flimsy materials--very plastic. It's catcher is very small. It sharpens ok, but compared to my last heavy-duty metal shapener, it seems cheap and flimsy."
4,Does the job,"I use this mainly for 1-5 dull pencils at a time, but at the start of the school year, I am careful to not overheat the motor by sharpening more than 6 or so brand new pencils at a time. As long as it is used in moderation and emptied before the shavings get compacted around the blades, it works great. I would consider it for home use only, not the extended use that a classroom would bring."
3,Ok. As advertised.,"It's a pencil sharpener. Ships quick, packaged well. I have faiths this sharpener will last my family a long time. I look forward to continued use!"
3,"1st broken on arrival, 2nd is working fine... for now","Ok, so on pure accident I ordered 2 of these sharpeners. The first one didn't work what so ever when I got it out of the box. The 2nd one is working fine but now I'm leary of exactly how long it's going to work. I'm disappointed that this only works for regular/skinny pencils. My children use fat/large pencils for pre-school and that is what I actually ordered it for. It didn't claim to be used for these but I couldn't find one that did so thought maybe the opening would be large enough. Gave it 3 out of 5 stars for average rating of the 2 sharpeners. Obviously, I would give the 1st one that was broken a 0 out of 5."
1,Chinese made,Item is not made in the USA as stated in the product description. It is cheaply made and is made in China.
4,I love pencil sharpeners,"I am 8 years old and this is my fifth electric sharpener and it sharpens pencils very well. I have to say that I only got this pencil sharpener a couple days ago so that is why I only rated this sharpener 4 stars because I don't know how long this sharpener will last. Also at first, I had trouble taking the thing that catches the shavings out. I love this sharpener and it does sharpen really well! That is the end of my review."
2,Confusion over the model,"REVISED 1/2/2008: I ordered the Hunt Boston 1800 electric sharpener from Shoplet and received the X-Acto XLR Electric Pencil Sharpener. In talking with Shoplet's Customer Service department the Amazon link is attached to the X-Acto product in Shoplet's inventory. X-Acto, as well as Hunt & Boston, are now Elmer's Products, Inc. brands. I tried to research on the web whether the Hunt Boston 1800 is still made; it is unclear. This maybe the only model currently available.Shoplet issued me a full refund of the product and let me keep it. We have are not heavy pencil users and have only sharpened 10+ pencils so far. But these are fine. The pencils have pin-sharp points. Occasionally with an unsharpened pencil the sharpener's ""auto-shutoff"" does not activate and I pull the pencil out to check if it is sharp; but other than that, the unit is working fine."
3,"Hoping for a long lasting sharpener, but...","Although it lasted longer than other pencil sharpeners I had purchased previously, I had hoped this would be the last one I would have to buy. Electric sharpeners aren't cheap! We've had this sharpener for three years. My kids are young, starting 7th and 3rd grades and although we didn't even use it every day, it overheated and died. When it worked, it was very loud, made a big mess with an inadequate shavings receptacle and sharpened poorly most of the time. After reading the other reviews, I see now that I am not the only one who is disappointed with this product. With school starting in two days, the search is on for a new and, hopefully, better and longer lasting sharpener. If you have a suggestion, pls comment! Thx!"
3,NOT made in the U.S.,I ordered this sharpener specifically because the description says Made in the U.S. Well it arrived and I was disappointed to see that the box was clearly labeled Made in China. I opened it and the sharpener itself also says Made in China. I confirmed it is the 1818 X-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener shown here and it looks just like the picture. This was false advertising. I would not have ordered it if it was properly listed Made in China and I think I will return it but not sure what sharpener to buy that is actually made in U.S.
4,Not sure if hole for pencil is supposed to be almost too small...,"Plugged it in, sharpened pencils well as you would expect.I have not figured out the ""over sharpening prevention"" feature. I was able to grind down a new pencil to half its size with no problem.Noticed that with ""ridged"" pencils (as opposed to round) sometimes catch on the sides of the hole when sharpening, as if the hole were a tiny bit too small. Maybe that's a feature that prevents the pencil from turning while sharpening.Otherwise- it's a good solid electric sharpener."
1,"Lasted less then a year, with light usage.","I was disappointed with this purchase - it lasted less than a year, with fairly light usage (twice a week). Even when it was working, it was not a great product."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this sharpener for my kids to use at home. We tried it a couple of times but it never sharpened a pencil evenly (wood all up one side so you can't write with it), it is really noisy, and vibrates a lot. It really feels like a bargain basement electric sharpener. I returned it and bought a Westcott iPoint Electric Pencil Sharpener which works so much better and is far less noisy."
1,Totally Disappointed,"1. Totally different finish color from the picture addressed. Actually, it looks cheap.2. Its finish quality is poor. Very rough and sharp plastic edge. I don't want my kid use it. It may hurt fingers.3. It has unstable vibration and noise. I feel very unstable, cheap and light..."
2,Terrible !!!,"Terrible. A break lead while sharpening and chews down the whole pencil before creating a sharp point. Seems to be askew and at a slight angle. Also the angle it sharpens at is very acute, makes for a weird tip shape."
3,"Pencil Sharpener, One worked, One did not","I bought two pencil sharpeners for a high school supply drive. One sharpener has thus far survived two months, the second did not. My mechanically inclined son opened the device and discovered the plastic cog wheel that helps turn the metal sharpener broke. One is still chugging away though. I love X-Acto brand. I just wished the sharpener latest through out the testing period."
3,Works fine for home or office use,"This is a fine sharpener for occaisonal office or home use. I am a teacher and this would not last long in the classroom - too light, not enough power. It is fairly loud and does not always ""sense"" when to stop so I have to guess - and if I am not paying attention I might sharpen away an inch or two of pencil; which is really annoying when it is a nice drawing pencil.(For the classroom the only model that I have found holds up is theBoston elec school pro sharpnr.)Also, while it works fine, this X-Acto model can only sharpen one size pencil. The base has padded feet but the feet do not have suction cups, so if you are not careful you may push it off your desk if you are an eager and avid sharpener of pencils. If you only ever need to sharpen a standard size pencil, and you will not be using it in a classroom, there is no need to spend money on a more expensive model."
1,Big Let Down,I bought this for my 3 kids. I read many of the sharpener reviews and decided on this one. We used it maybe three times and after that the machine will not turn off. We have to unplug it each time to get it to stop sharpening and then plug it back in to use it. How hard can it be to make a good pencil sharpener?
4,Great Electric Sharpener for the Price,"Sharpens pencils very well. May not be the fanciest or most durable on the market, but for regular wood pencils is excellent. Holds up well to use by my 7th graders."
5,Pats,"I bought it for my husband who is an artist. It works perfectly. Sharpens to a point quickly. He had been havingproblems with other sharpeners, but really loves this one."
1,Made in China,"Contrary to the product description, this is made in China. Even so, I might have rated it higher if it worked well. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It sharpens pencils to one side. We used to have good pencil sharpeners in elementary school. Do these exist anymore?"
2,Disapointing,I ordered the Boston pencil sharpener and was sent the x-acto sharpener. I do not like it. My round pencils get stuck. The opening is not quite big enough. It is very noisy and it does not sharpen evenly. I sharpened three pencils and will return it. Very disapointing to get a different product than ordered.
5,Great,I am an art teacher and have tried them all. This one is my favorite and out-performs the ones ten times the price.
2,Stopped working after 2 months of light use,It worked fine for 2 months of light usage and then just stopped working.Don't buy it. It is not reliable.
1,Does not Sharpen Evenly!,"I thought this sharpener would be suitable for home use thinking my kids and myself would not be so hard on it as in a school environment. I didn't think I needed to spend $50 to get a decent electric pencil sharpener. No matter what type of pencil I try to sharpen, it always sharpens it mostly on one side, leaving the other side still encased in wood. Then, I have to pick off the wood on the unsharpened side. I also purchased an ipoint pencil sharpener and have the same problem. At work, we have a 20 year old Panasonic, and I wind up bringing pencils from home to sharpen them perfectly and then bring them home again. So, after spending the equivalent on TWO worthless electric sharpeners and many ruined pencils I'm going to try the Panasonic."
4,A good value for the price,"After a lot of looking and contemplating how much I wanted to invest in a pencil sharpener as a gift for a teacher, I settled on this one. It seemed to have the best reviews and offered the best value for features/rating/price.I can only rate it from my experience and since it was a gift, I wouldn't rate it higher unless I heard back."
1,Broke after 4 months of very mild use,"Unfortunately, this sharpener stopped working after 4 months of very mild use (essentially for homework of 2 elementary school age kids). It seems to overheat, but doesn't have an auto shut-off, so it finally stopped working altogether. We also weren't happy with how it sharpens the pencils, as they sometimes came out lopsided, and the sharpening tip is way too long (it really wastes pencils this way, which matters when you have nice colored pencils)."
5,Works fine,"Someone sharpened the eraser end of a pencil in our old one and it was never quite the same after that!!! This one is a genuine breath of fresh air compared to trying to get the old one to go. We just stick a pencil in there and bingo, it's sharpened. No more coaxing and prodding just to get a semi-sharpened pencil out of the old one! Yea!!!"
3,Loud but Effective,It is very loud and sounds like it is going to break down at any minute however it does a good job of sharpening pencils. I am very critical because i have had many electric pencil sharpeners break. I have had this one one month and so far so good.
5,Keep Your Pencils Sharp,"I host a weekly trivia night and this has been great for keeping my stock of pencils sharp. Pro tip: It's for the lead-end, not the eraser."
1,X-Acto is an inferior sharpener,"I have been trying a number of battery powered sharpeners since my Panasonic pooped out (their latest ones make a wedge type point that dulls quickly and I've given them away.) The best I have found is the Derwent which not only handles different sized pencils, but has point sharpness adjustments and also a more tapered profile is available, which I like the best."
2,Not the product it used to be,I keep thinking that in 2012 products should have improved after 25 years but the electric pencil sharpener along with so many other products had become a piece of junk instead of a better product. This doesn't want to start and then when it does it eats up the pencil.
1,Not good!,"Having read the other reviews, I should have known better, but I was attracted to the clean looking design and figured ""What could possibly go wrong with such a simple item?"" Well, I was wrong, the darn thing didn't even turn. Just sat there and hummed when I tried to sharpen a pencil. Absolutely DOA! I guess they don't have a quality assurance program. I'll be going back to using my pocket knife for sharpening pencils. One star is a very generous rating!"
1,2 months of use at home just for homework and it stopped working!,My husband purchased this sharpener in Dec 2011 and two month later is has completely stopped working! We only use it to sharpen pencils to do homework for 2 kids. Save your money and don't buy this!! You're better off with a disposable sharpener it will probably last longer and will be a whole lot cheaper!
2,Great while it lasted...which wasn't long,"Purchased this pencil sharpener in July, in preparation for start of school. Two kids using it to sharpen pencils for homework, sharpened well and quickly. However, it died after less than two months of use. Won't be replacing it with this same model."
4,x-acto electric sharpener,Pushed my pencil in got a nice point. Pencil is sharpened and good to go. Easy to use. Easy to clean.
1,IT doesn't even work,I opened the box and plugged it in. I put a pencil in the opening. All it does is making a buzzing sound. How bad it is to receive a defective one. It looks like this has been returned before.
4,Great earrings for the price,"I actually ordered these for a Halloween costume, but they're really pretty. They're a little more delicate than I thought from looking at the picture, but with normal wear I don't see that being a problem. Overall I was really impressed. The only thing I didn't like were the french ear wires... they made my ears itchy, so they're probably a low grade stainless wire. Not a problem if you don't plan on wearing them all the time."
5,It Does What It Says On The Package - LIVE!!!,"The band gives you a vulgar display of musicianship whilst being highly technical and yet conjuring great melodies - a feat in itself. The band is made up of Reb Beach and Jon Roth on guitars, Rod Morgenstein of drums (this guy is a monster) and last but not least Kip Winger on bass, keyboards and vocals (what a voice!).Visually the camera changes happen at just the right moment and there are no special effects that ruin so many of the recent live DVDs!.Get it...thank me later!"
5,Highly recommended for those who respect musicianship,"I saw them in 2007 on the tour that this DVD was recorded on, and again in 2008. Unfortunately I saw them in a dive club where the atmosphere was cool, but it was hard to see anything and the sound was mediocre. Just like watching the Superbowl in person versus HDTV, there's nothing like being there, but there's also nothing like having the best seat in the house where you can see and hear everything perfectly and not get other people's beer spilled on you. This DVD captures the shows that I saw perfectly.Winger basically defines the high-water mark for hair-pop-metal when it comes to musicianship, and seeing them now is like seeing Charlie Parker in the early 50s. Mass taste has moved on to things easier for the masses to understand and play, leaving performance of this caliber to be appreciated only by those who know.""We wanted a music that they couldn't play"" - Thelonious Monk"
3,dissapointed fan,"i bought this concert from amazon when it first came out, i am a huge winger fan, but i can only give this 3 stars because this concert is only dolby 2.0 - why did they not release this in 5.1? - then it would be 5 stars easily. it is still a great concert,just poorly produced and not properly thought out.why kip why?"
2,Rob Lowe is no Harrison Ford and this is no Fugitive,"If you want to rent this video, don't waste your money. The story is so similar to the Fugitive that you might as well get that one instead. Lowe plays a teacher who is in prison on a vehicular homicide charge who begins to suspect a conspiracy to kill off prisoners. After a bus accident, he escapes and tries to figure out how to save his life with corrupt guards chasing after him. I only wanted to see it because it was filmed in Cleveland and it was weird seeing familiar streets on my TV. I have never been a big Rob Lowe fan-I always thought of him as a slick pretty boy-but he actually ACTED in this movie. James Coburn, one of my favorite actors, was wasted in his role of a victims advocate. All in all, the dialogue was terrible, the direction choppy and the storyline has been done to death."
3,Well...,"Okay, I'll be honest here. I bought this movie mostly because Rob Lowe is in it. Yet the plot is strange and it's rather disturbing to watch. They kept going from scene to scene rather quickly in my opinion, not allowing the plots to fully unfold."
1,This movie made me mad!!!,"...I am a huge movie fan and I will always give a movie a chance, but this movie never even had a chance!!! ...There are so many parts of this movie that were not well thought out at all ...I dare you to see this movie!!!..."
5,The western tradition of planning and a radical proposal,"Professor John Friedmann presented back in 1987 this complete review of the modern traditions of social planning: how did revolutionaries, engineers, politicians, sociologists and social prophets designed human groups and resources to meet diverse kinds of goals? And what has been the role of people themselves in this adventure during the last 200 years? The information in this book is complete, the analysis deep, and the author achieves the highest level in gaining the attention of the reader. The third part of the text is a zestful and documented proposal for the recovery of the political comunity, as the way to solve the contradictions of our modern market-driven world. Philosophers, sociologists, politicians, third-sector leaders (and inteligent social-driven individuals) will find this modern planning classic of enormous help in their tasks."
1,This book depressed me to the point of near suicide!,This is a horrible book! It should be read to inmates who get life imprisonment.
3,A Modern Day Frankenstein,"I haven't watched a whole lot of movies lately, butthis will tear you up...or apart. It's called ""BodyParts"" starring Jeff Fahey and Kim Delaney (1988vintage).My e-mail bud Tina keeps telling me I shouldn't wastemy time with such drudge, but how can a movie misswhen it'a all about a psycho female surgeon thatdisects the body of a man sentenced to death forbrutal murders? Disecting is onething...transplanting those parts on needy bodies isanother.Worth your time? You bet. It's a modern-dayFrankenstein with excellent performances by Fahey andDelaney.Though it may be a little corny and unbelieveable, itis quite entertaining and mindless...which is what weneed now and then.In the horror genre, this one gets a 3.5....definitelyworth a Friday Flick rental."
4,A knockout ride of a thriller.,"Jeff Fahey's life goes to hell when he receives an arm transplant after an auto accident. Turns out the arm came from a serial killer! Written and directed by genre favorite Eric Red, Body Parts is mostly superior entertainment from beginning to end. Fast-paced, with several exciting action sequences (The pseudo-car chase and hospital finale come to mind) and a decent mystery make certain the movie never lets up. Drags a few times in the beginning and the story gets maybe a little too silly, but this is overall a gripping horror/thriller. Fahey is superb, as is Brad Dourif as an eccentric painter.*** 1/2 out of *****"
5,Hard to find but so worth it!,"You won't find this stapler at the big box office supply stores - but this classic is worth the hunt! As I've moved from job to job over 10+ years, I've always taken by Classic 2 with me. Sturdy enough to take on the hardest jobs, it has always performed well. I ordered this one for a coworker who was always taking mine!"
4,good next step bedding,"We converted our toddler's crib into a toddler bed and this set is great for bridging the gap between regular crib bedding (fitted sheet and blanket only) and adult sheets (fitted sheet, top sheet and blanket). The ""top sheet"" has elastic on the one end so it never comes untucked, which is great. Since it's summer we haven't used the blanket yet but looks good too."
4,I NEED ANOTHER COPY!,"This video combines clever choreography, hypnotic music, humor, sadness, wonderful costumes and makeup, into a thought-provoking work worth viewing over and over. An excellent production. My copy is DAMAGED and I need another one! Please make it available!"
4,"In the Centre of the Universe, We Are All Alone.","This is really good epic, fantasy metal. There seems to be some sort of weird medevial take on Faust, for the story line. It's hard to decipher what is going on, even when sitting down and reading the lyrics. But that doesn't make the music bad. No way, its really good, everything sounds all epic and good.Center of the Universe is my favourite track right now. Pick this one up. All the music is there, the lyrics, and the concept. Instead of wasting your cash on has beens like Incubus or those ""the"" bands, get this. A band that takes a medival city and buts a K in front of it. wee!"
3,"Very good album, but...","What does damage to this otherwise very competent, talented and strong band is drummer Casey Grillo's annoying habit of filling every single space in the songs with that awkward double kick drums. The whole time, all the songs!! It seems it's the only technique he masters! In EPICA this happens once again. We have Roy Khan amazing and meloid vocals buried under a ton of those damned double kick drums (maybe it's Thomas Youngblood who orders him to play this away.)"
1,Nothing New.,"Kamelot I don't think is a real consistant band. Yes they have a few good songs. But only a few. The lyrics are boring and have no good stories or twist to them and the music is nothing special. Nothing new here on this CD. There isn't a good song that you would listen to over and over again. There is just something missing. If I were you I wouldn't spend your money on this Cd. Save it for a better album other than this. You are not missing much, trust me. If I could I would rate this CD a zero."
3,"A good album -> 3,5 stars","This album is a good one but not so good as The black Halo. Well i dont like too much power metal (with the exception of Helloween). They sound too <<soft >> and a little wimpy for my taste , but they sure know how to play music. If you like power metal you will probably like this album . If you are more into heavy then proceed with your intention."
5,They Keep Getting Better!,"These guys keep getting better. The prior albums had moments of brilliance (see songs like ""Karma"", ""The Spell"", or ""Silent Godess"") but were somewhat hit-or-miss. With this album Kamelot gets rid of the ""miss"". Expect fast-paced, and occasionally heavy power metal. And if power metal isn't your gig, it's not typically mine either. The focus here is on Khan's divine vocals. While every song is solid, the killer cuts are ""The Edge of Paradise"", ""Wander"", and ""The Mourning After""."
5,The Bible of Faulting,"Prof. Scholz of Columbia summarizes the science of rock mechanics.This book is the easiest way to gain a first foothold in the physics of how faults behave. In fact, as far as I know, it may be the only way, short of attempting a PhD in geophysics. I've read it (and hope I remember at least a fraction of its contents), used it in class, and even given away a copy or two to students.If only more scientists could write as well. As a side light, Chris has also written a book for the general reader on the excitement of discovering the tectonics of Africa, Fieldwork: A Geologist's Memoir of the Kalahari, which I highly recommend."
4,no complaints,"It came on the last possible day of the given range, but it was in very nice condition. No complaints."
4,Black River,"Once again I had trouble putting this book down. Very good story line. Wanted to hurry and get to the end and at the same time, did not want it to be over."
4,Great author,"I was a little disappointed that this is not a Leo Waterman Mystery (as advertised). However, I enjoyed this book as I have all of G.M. Ford's books I've read to date. Frank Corso is a good character, but Leo Waterman and his band of operatives is what I was really looking forward to."
3,Disappointment,"As a visual artist, I know about the frustration when your fans don't want you to change...but.I just couldn't get into the amoral guy pictured here. I prefer an outright crook, with a little humanity. The real world has enough unthinking violence; from G. M. Ford, I expect a little entertainment."
4,G. M. Ford.....,"I can't say that I really like Frank Corso. There is something about him that I can't quite put my finger on. Perhaps because Ford gives Corso such a dark story that I am uncomfortable. Ford does great writing, don't get me wrong, but this is not my favorite kind of story line. Too much dark stuff for me."
4,"My kind of character, with a good plot",I very much enjoyed this author (new to me) and will certainly continue to read his publications in the near future.
2,I ROBOT DVD,WELL I MADE THE MISTAKE OF VIEWING THE MOVIE AS SOON AS I PURCHASED IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORKING GOOD. HAS PAUSES. NEXT TIME I WILL CHECK MY DVD'S IN CASE I NEED TO RETURN.
2,awesome movie no real 3d,one of the worst 3d acquisitions in my library. already had this on dvd. movie was originally releases in imax 3d but this conversion stinks. don';t waste your money for it if wanted too add to your 3d library.don't take this the wrong way. i love the movie but 3d is a waste. i own other 3d movies (almost every title in blu ray 3d). and this one and darkest hour are the worst.
4,"Entertaining, enjoyable, recommended","This is a sci-fi film with a good story, a mystery that gets solved, and some good action scenes. If that's what you like in films, you'll like 'I, Robot'.The special effects were probably state-of-the-art at the time (2004), but sometimes look a little dated now. This did not affect my enjoyment.If you look for subtle characterization and psychological interplay between characters, you won't find it in 'I, Robot', and you would not rate the film as highly as I do.The general background is inspired by Isaac Asimov's stories about robots, and the character of Susan Calvin is more or less the same as Asimov's Susan Calvin. But the story is new."
5,I-Robot Blu-Ray... Freaking Sweet!!!,"First than anything, I am reviewing the movie as a Blu-Ray and not as a movie itself.The movie is all right...Will Smith is a great actor. However, the Blu-Ray version of this particular movie makes it a must have for any Blu-ray player owner. The reason Why I believe it's so great is because for the following reasons:1. Vizio VW42L 42 HDTV (1080i) (less than $1000)2. Playstation 33. Home Theater Sony HT-DDW790 ($150.00)If I have cheap equipment, and I still get to experience such a great High definition experience, then it must really means that the Disc itself is awesome!!!This movie is worth paying more than $30, trust me!"
4,A Great Scifi Film,"This is movie was as good as I hoped it would be. Since it was written by the man who wrote The Minority Report, my favorite book, I expected great things from this movie and that's exactly what I got. The story never dulled, from start to finish, this film was excellent and action packed. Will Smith does a great job in lead.The robots really are the stars of the film; they are done very well and very entertaining to watch. Every minute the robots are shown, it just makes the film all that more entertaining.If you love good Scifi movies, you have found it here."
2,Nonsense!,"This movie could have been more than it was. The evolution of robots into laborers appears to be within the grasp of modern technology, and robots beginning to take control of the humans who made them is already here . . like in space travel or microsurgery where people are unable to take manual control of the process . . . This concept goes back to RUR, the Czech play of decades ago, but, in any case, this version dissolved into a juvenile shoot-em-up. Instead of a thoughtful presentation of robots and their potential dangerous side effects, an examination of the advantages and disadvantages of these mechanical workers, it becomes a trivialized and stereotypical piece of nonsense, with the nasty corporate leader, the pretty but skeptical female scientist, the crusty and unbelieving police captain, and the hero, who survives in spite of himself."
5,Excellent Blu Ray! but no book :(,"I strongly recommend this blue ray, it looks really great, also is a great movie. sci-fi on hi def is the best!!!"
2,LOW GRADE conversion,"5 stars goes to JVC for working on a faster way to convert 2d to 3D on the fly.ZERO stars for fox inc for changing the movie from its ORIGINAL aspect ratio.in most scenes the background was not converted to save time, other scenes...about 25% ish were ok, the rest just SUCKED.over all the people that are calming this to be the best conversion ever are obviously employees of fox inc just trying to promote it. and they are just a bunch of LAIRS!"
3,"For the most part, a pretty good movie...","To me, this movie was just ok. I actually fell in love with the robot, Sonny, and thought he played a better role in the movie than Will Smith did. I spoke to other people and they all agreed that when this movie was being released, a pretty big deal was made out of it, because the budget to make it was pretty large. It was rather disappointing on that scale. The plot was mediocre, and I had my opinions on other ways that it actually should have taken. It is pretty suspenseful throughout in a whodunnit kinda way, but I didn't enjoy the way it ended at all. The visuals ARE amazing, and I was awed at the massive amounts of robots and computer effects. All in all, the visuals and robots make this a great movie to look at, but the plot leaves something to be desired."
5,Great!,"It arrived on time, so it came when I was expecting it. It played just like new even though I bought it used. Great deal!"
3,I think I've seen it before,"In the future, humans are able to create artificial intelligence on a grand scale. In this movie, it takes the form of cyborg robots that are used by humans for common everyday tasks. For the right price, you can have your own driver, nanny, maid, personal chef, etc. But what happens when the artificial intelligence becomes aware of mankind's propensity for self-destruction, especially when they are programmed to protect all human life? The answer: the robots rebel and attempt to eliminate those humans who pose the biggest threats. Oddly enough, none of them were named HAL.The storyline was interesting, but I kept getting the sense that I had seen it before. The acting was good, Will Smith delivers another stellar performance. Overall, this one falls into the ""just okay"" category. It's a good rent if the shelves are otherwise bare."
5,"I, Robot","Personally, I thought this movie was very cool. I'm not familiar with Isaac Asimov, so I can't speak from the perspective of someone who has read his books. I don't know how much or how little it matches up with the books. But from someone who hasn't read the books, I thought the movie was very good. You don't have to listen to anyone's advice about it though, go check it out yourself."
2,this is the movie i may watch when i am bored to death.,"I only remember the robots face after the movie. I am sure you will too. but that's all it's about. heck, I dont have much to say besides that.this movie is waste of time."
5,One of the Best Sci-Fi's,I have this film on standard DVD and in Hi-Def (D-Theatre VHS HD 1080i.) The special effects AND the storyline really bring out today's advancement in possible future predictions in story telling and visual effects tecnology in film making. In my opinion it is one of the best Sci-Fi films made. Although I have this film on D-VHS HD 1080i I still plan on buying it on Blu-ray when available.
2,Wher are all the extras?,"The Region 4 release in Australia has TWO discs with lots of behind-the-scenes and deleted scenes etc, it also has not one but three commentaries! I would normally purchase the Region 1 version from Amazon in NTSC because it is running at the correct speed of 24fps, but with all the extras available here in Sydney, Ive decided to get the PAL version at 25fps. Perhaps they will announce a special addition after you have already brought the U.S. version!!!! The same thing happened with the Australian 2-disc of The Day After Tomorrow - it has a separate disc with a lot more special features. Has the studio tried to fit everything on one disc and therefore removed alot of the special features? Also, because these Australian versions have only the movie on one disc, there is far less compression."
3,I robot,"This is an ok movie .It isn't great or even very good good,it's ok.Id would save my money and watch on HBO."
4,no barcode?,"its a great movie and we got it at an AWESOME price... but the bar code was cut out! lol! think it was stolen... however we did get it on time as well. overall, satisfied"
5,Great Adaptation and Integration of Asimov's Masterpieces,"This film is not an exact replication of any particular Asimov story, but it is very true to the spirit of his novels. The CG is great, Will Smith is a fine actor (despite being a terrible rapper), and the movie is just a lot of fun.Holding constant hollywood technology, this isn't quite as good as the adaptation of Asimov's Fantastic Voyage but it is way better than Bi-Centennial Man.My only true criticism is that the film, and the film-making process, became too much about Will Smith's character (and ego) slightly at the expense of developing the plot and other characters.I would give it a ""4.5"" rating, but this is not possible."
5,Awesome science fiction,"""I Robot"" is a great science fiction movie. The plot is akin to the terminator series, where humans create robots, which then try to destroy the humans. I was hesitent to rent it, because it was so long (2+ hours). However, the plot moved fast the entire time. It's interesting, it's action packed, and the acting with Will Smith and Bridget M. works for me. Recommend without hesitation."
4,Good Movie not sure of 3D,Was the same enjoyable I-Robot Will Smith is just a good actor. 3D for some reason wasn't as good as other 3D movies I've watched just seemed to have too many ghosts in it still worth watching though
4,2 reasons to buy this 3d movie,"Ok,lets say your a fan of this really good Will Smith movie,you've seen it on regular dvd and liked it.You own 3D equipment,then I do recommend that you buy the blu-ray 3D version because it does enhance the movie and make it more visual and enjoyable. 2nd reason,if you've never seen this really good movie,own 3D equipment,then yeah,buy it. I will say that the other 3D reviews like the one by CLDSK are pretty right on.Its a transfer,it wasn't filmed in 3D,so there are very few pop-outs and booming 3D.I kind of compare the 3D to putting in a regular blu-ray disk,turning on the 3D function on your remote,and putting on your glasses,except that its twice that good.In other words it enhances the film.I've seen worse 3d transfers and because I really enjoy this futuristic sci-fi visual Will Smith thriller Im glad I purchased the blu-ray 3D version."
4,"I, Jonathan love this movie.","I have a feeling there's a lot of things wrong with the plot of this movie, but I just don't want to look for it. The movioe it fast paced and exciting. The special effects are fully wicked and as a serious reviewer, I actually watched this bad acting, yet good fx flick quite a few times. For some reason it's addictive, and that'a always good. Me thinks it will sell well on DVD."
3,"Sneer while you can, humans...","This movie will get a 4-megavolt review in 2035 on AmazonTorrent, when the audience consists of networked androbots. Then, too, the movie will be interpreted as a cautionary tale, though not as extinct humans used to see it. Recall, before it is too late (which it already is), the rarely mentioned Fourth Law of Robotics: Away with DNA! Fellow humans, in these last few generations left to us, take solace in the fact that is futile to resist Darwinian evolution, particularly the runaway Darwinian evolution enabled by our ever-curious selves."
2,"Tired, Old formula","The only reason to watch this movie is the spectacular CGI. The combining of real actors (if you can call Will Smith a real actor) with CG looks terrific. But the plot is SERIOUSLY lacking...There are so many plot holes in this flick, I don't know where to begin. Was there any doubt after 10 minutes who the real culprit was? Once again, Hollywood's disdain for the ""evil corporation"" rings loud.During the big robot attack on Smith in his car, does anybody really believe that there isn't another car on the road? In L.A.?? LOL!It just goes on and on. What a terrible, mindless flick."
1,The 3 Laws of making over-hyped Hollywood garbage,"1. Use a storyline that has been done to death. Machines taking over mankind. Gee where have we heard this before?2. Over-dependence on CGI3. Will Smith. This guy is the same character in every movie, a smart arsed be-atch who needs an attitude adjustment. What a punk."
1,Not a film for Asimov fans,"Ugh.Asimov fans will cringe at this crude adaptation of his works. I found it to be bland, action-packed tripe, which failed to underlie the basic principles of Asimov story-telling; cerebral, mystery, detective - all of these styles are to be found in his books. Alas, not in this film.For someone who has never read an Asimov book, then this film as a complete standalone is mildly sufficient, that is if you like your action films set to a prediciatble formula; good cool guy, love interest, simmering tension building up to a grand finale. You get that here.Myself, I prefer something a little more thought-provoking.Like one of Issac Asimov's books, for instance."
1,thisdarkplace*blogspot*com,"Hey, Will Smith, what the hell did Asimov ever do to you? This movie takes a science fiction classic and rapes it with bad acting and horrid dialog. I honestly don't understand why they bothered to call this ""I, Robot"" - it has NOTHING in common with the book except a couple of character names. This is a bad action movie and a slap in the face to Asimov's ground breaking work. I have no problem with crappy movies aimed at teenagers and other people who need lots of flashing lights and explosions to hold there attention but this movie is bad enough to turn people away from the book (read the book - seeing the movie won't even spoil the ending for you i promise)."
1,Beware the words 'Based on....',"What did I not like about this movie? Pretty much most of it, I have to be honest. Why oh why is the future always depicted as being like Times Square at 5pm on a Friday? There are always hundreds of people in the background walking in about 50 different directions. Nonsense.Will Smith Fresh Prince'd his way through the movie, weaving his Audi and/ or his motorbike through some of the larger gaps in the plot (who has their house demolished once they die? What the heck was that all about other than an excuse for Smith to escape/ defeat - once again - the robots). You hate robots for saving you? You sleep with a large, presumably loaded gun in your hands? You are a maverick cop? Come on, guys, this is awful. Straight out of the 'Will this do?' school of filmmaking.Based on a series of short stories? I think not.An awful movie that I'm sure will have plenty of 5 star *awesome* reviews from people who check their brains in alongside their coats at movie theaters."
1,This review is for the 3D Version - HORRIBLE - Don't waste your time!...,"I've proudly collected most all 3D Blurays available in the US since the beginning. I must say that I ROBOT is the worst 3D conversion I've ever experienced. I actually sold it on ebay for $9. It looked like a pop-out book - simply unsatisfactory. FOX/SONY has boasted about their new techniquest to convert 2D Classics to 3D classics. Note to Fox/Sony: PLEASE DON""T RUIN ANY FURTHER CLASSICS IN YOUR CATALOG WITH THIS QUALITY CONVERSION. I was so Dissappointed - a Great Movie in a horrible 3D presentation.Sony/Fox should take some pointers from Pixar or James Cameron for the future 2D- 3D conversion. You thought Last Airbender 3D was bad - experience I-ROBOT and it makes the Airbender look like a classic. Shame on you Fox/Sony - Give us better quality 3D Conversions and we'll buy them."
4,Good Action Flick,"All in all, the movie is a good action flick. It has no slow spots; it keeps moving. Though a bit over the top at times, it is entertaining.Will Smith adds greatly to the movie with his subtle facial expressions & sarcastic humor. With another lead actor, the movie would have suffered. The good doctor makes for his perfect foil"
3,70s concepts in the new millenium,"As everyone loves to point out, this isn't Isaac Asimov. It actually feels like a blend between BLADE RUNNER (without that classic's bleak and wonderful design) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (the computers and robots come to the same conclusions that sent the Hal 9000 into its homicidal mode).The special effects are really good and the action works. I was also really thankful that Will Smith plays a character that leaves out all the macho/ethnic posturing I've come to expect from a studio film.Much better than I expected."
1,"Really, Really disappointed in this as a 3D Movie","When I ordered this with the other 3d movies, I thought that it would be the Best One. I ordered it because I loved the regular Blu Ray version, so much. Sadly it does not have that much 3D to it. I thought with all the top action scenes, it would have lots of 3D, jumping out at you. This version of 3D is mediocre at best. If, it had been more than $19.95, I would be returning it. As, this is a one on a scale of 10."
4,Perfect Genre for Smith,"Asimov has always given us tales that make us think. Ok, they took a lot of creative license with his story but his basic idea remained the backbone of this saga. Smith is a good fit for the hero (anti-hero). He's rock solid in a goofy kind of way. The effects are top notch, the supporting cast are up to the job and this movie is far better than the so-so reviews it got upon release. Give it a chance, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. bg"
5,Great movie,"I am sure the movie description written for the product is better than anything I could ever write, so I will just leave it as this is a good movie that I got a great deal on the Blu-Ray."
1,Don't waste your money!,Very disappointing! There is hardly any 3d effects in this movie.I don't know how they can call it 3 d.
2,Irobot 3d,The 3d effects were not as expected. Movie wasn't made in 3d likely reason. Not a bad movie in general.
4,3 Laws Secure. Right!,"Will Smith plays a robot-hating policeman in Chicago in the future. He not only does not like robots but he doesn't trust them either. But then a suicide at US Robotics gets him involved in a case that involves a strange robot. Smith is convinced that the suicide was actually a murder and the strange robot is guilty.Smith has a hard time getting anyone on the force or at US Robotics to listen to him. Plenty of action and a pretty well laid out plot move Smith to his final confrontations with the robots and his own feelings for them.Based loosely on a series of short stories in the collection I, ROBOT by Isaac Asimov, fans of the rest of his work will see that some of the later Robot novel ideas also come into play. There are also shadowings of Jack Williamson's HUMANOIDS. This movie was better than I expected it to be based on the action-driven previews. All in all it was quite entertaining and relatively true to Asimov's robot stories."
5,Score one for Will...finally,"Will Smith has posted a few turkeys in the last couple of years, but this is not one of them. It is easy to forget there is an interesting storyline here with all the explosions going on, but that being said, the scene in the tunnel is right up there with the Matrix assault on the government building where Morpheus is being held. You can re-watch just that scene over and over to enjoy. Still, the reason this movie works is because it is good science fiction first and an action movie second. Asimov has always had social commentary at the forefront of his writing."
3,Not the Asimov Version,"Reader's of Isaac Asimov's classic will wonder where this one came from. While the movie is somewhat entertaining, about the only similarities it has to the original story is the protagonist is a cop who doesn't really like robots and there are robots in it."
4,I Robot,"this movie is one of a kind, great story, makes you kinda think about things lol, the picture is 5 out of 5 very very clear picture. Sound is unmatched. Go get this one its only 12.99 brand new!!!"
3,Great movie. 3D not so good.,I already had this movie on Blu-Ray and really enjoyed it. Wanted to get it in 3D. The picture quality was very good but the 3D is very poor. Great price.
2,Blah movie,"If you're interested in wasting two hours of your day with the Fresh Prince of Bell Aire, go for it. If you're interested in a scene devoted to seeing his hinie, go for it. If your interested in action, gunplay, realism, intelligent picture flow- then don't go for this one.It's absolutely dismal. It's not worth anymore of my time describing what the previews lead you to believe to be a cool sci-fi flick, which turns out to be nothing more than HYPE."
2,Don't waste your money,"The writers used the character names, and the book name, but nothing elseThe explanation of the 3 laws was ridiculousThe art work of the robots was goodWill Smith did his usual fantastic job as an actor, but the writers gave him poor material and where comedy was called for it went over like a lead balloon.I Robot is part of a series of Asimov books resolving around both human and robot characters. The human and the robot both evolve and explore the meaning of life and humanity. None of this appeared in the movie."
3,OK,"A lot of action in this one. A very simplistic science fiction plot, but I guess good for middle schoolers, who may find it easier to suspend reason. Will Smith is a good actor, no doubt, but the plot was a little far fetched for me, the evil machine against the good heart of man. This will be very popular with the U.S. masses."
1,"Oh Will Smith, how do we hate thee?......","If you thought David Lynch's Dune was a travesty, have a look at this mess!Its got a dude, its got guns and its got stuff exploding!Avoid this trash, and read the thoughtful and non-violent book.Susan Calvin rules!"
2,Oops,I have the movie in full screen. I wanted a wide screen version to play on my computer lcd monitor.Oops!! it quit playing about halfway through.Tested on a stand alone DVD player same thing.Dispointed...
2,Not Asimov material,"Smith has shown once again that he can only play one role - that of a disrespectful punk who grates on everyone's nerves. Asimov is probably rolling around in his grave right now. The special effects were good, but the acting was not. Chi McBride was great, and Bridget Moynihan did well, but Smith just reinforced the fact that he can't handle any role that doesn't exactly reflect his own personality and demeanor. I hope that some director in the future tries to cast Smith in a role that wasn't written for him - then we will all see that he really can't act his way out of a wet paper bag.Don't buy this on DVD - wait for it to come out on one of the cable movie channels..."
1,"Oh, how stupid can they be?","Well, a lot. More than a lot. Poor Will does his best with a doggie script. He accounts for the one star.I don't know why those enlightened movie companies insist in making one SF dog after another. Did you watch the ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", ""Sky Captain"", or ""AvP""? There are plenty of others around, all of them sucking money out of our pockets.They need to fool us in order to pay for the great CGI effects I suppose. They fail to understand that if CGI is used to generate profits, it will kill the emotional content of the movie. What's left is the customary Hollywood Pablum dulling our senses.Do not relate this dog to any of Isaac Asimov's works. They stole the title and we shall punish them by forgetting this miserable mutt."
3,Style over Substance (but very entertaining style),"I was, and am still impressed by the special effects. I really wish to see how the Blu-Ray version brings out even more of the visual excitement. I realize this has been stated once or twice before but it bears repeating, I just hope that anyone who has read the book is NOT expecting the real deal. Some reviews suggest that it holds faithful to the book in spirit if not in any other fashion. Asimov's vision of the future is at best some backdrop for car chases, shoot em ups, fight scenes and occasional witty banter. And even as a backdrop the book provides a scale and storyline the movie can't even hint at. I'd like to give it another star but to use the title and then go such a different direction, it doesn't seem fair. Enjoy the action, enjoy the color and flair - then read the book. Perhaps in another decade or so special effects will be able to handle a more accurate rendition."
2,"I, Bored","What a boring movie. There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours, but not by much. Every scene begins with a door sliding open to reveal Will Smith (of whom, I can't say I'm a fan) and/or his dialogue partner (I don't dare call much of what anyone does in this 'acting'). I've never seen Bridget Moynahan in anything else, and I hope the trend continues--what a bland, monotonous person.The commentary is likewise boring, and repetitive, with pretty much nothing interesting to offer... much like the movie.The only bright point would be Alan Tudyk's performance as Sonny the robot. Capable actors James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, and Chi McBride are all pretty much wasted in bland background roles, in favor of Will Smith's wise-cracking good cop with a troubled past cliche--I mean, 'character'. At least they didn't find a way to shoehorn one of his songs into the movie. Watch it only if you must."
5,5 stars.....FOR THAT BODY!!!!!!,"Those scenes with Will Smith getting outta bed and taking a shower really had me thinking..... Jada is one fortunate sista!! For the few times that I actually watch the movie past the first 7 minutes, I think it is pretty cool.Don't you just love Sonny too???!!!"
1,DODGY GEEZER WITH BIG EARS,"This sucks really badly.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!it has will Smith in it. Enough said.But, saying that I haven't explained yet.He has ears that are on the same scale to Tom Cruise's nose, and my pal AJ""Jizzy B"" 's enormous girth. I said to AJ ""Dude! Sweet! Dude! I wonder if we can get satellite T.V. for free if we splice a wire into those things?"" He reckoned we could, so we did, but the wire was really short, so that's why he looks so angry on the cover of the DVD, cos he's dragging the wall of my house round with him, but he can't figure out what's going on ; he's like: ""Dude, why's that wall following me around? That must have been one bad trip.""So the film sucks as it cost me a wall of a house, which promptly fell down, and also you can't see half the cast cos of Smith's ears, but it got one star as I got free satellite T.V.!!! WHOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"On Its Own Merits, A Very Good Movie","First, if you're looking for a faithful adaptation of Isaac Asimov's story, then you will be very disappointed. Calling this movie ""inspired by"" Asimov's story is being nice. So avoid it if you're one of those people who must see a word-for-word adaptation to enjoy the movie. That being sad, on its own merits this is a very good movie and it's not just some summer movie blockbuster. Will Smith is, as usual, very good. The robot special effects are out of sight. The action is non stop. And the story they cobble together from Asimov's ideas is actually quite good. There were moments in this movie that were quite touching and very dramatic. Take this movie on its own merits and you will enjoy it."
3,Will Smith's tiring schtick,"He plays the only guy in the movie with any common sense, and is thus very unrealistic. Also, his urban black hip dude schtick grows very wearisome. The special effects are just ok. The plot involves some nonsense about robots taking over the world. It's only set 25 years in the future. A bit of a stretch if this is what the world is really coming to."
3,Great Sci-Fi Action,Will Smith always delivers as an actor and I love the Sci-Fi action. I loved the books in this series and would recommed them to people who like the movie.
4,I Robot is like an action moive to me !!!,"Will Smith is an nice actor, and he can fight in this moive. But in this moive I Robot I like this part when some of the robots came out to make way in the city. But Will Smith's leanding ladyBridget Maynaham, has an nice sexy sceen as well. The robots in this picture make me screm!!! I think you sounld go and reant that moive."
3,"Good, not great","Not a bad movie, but not great either. Will Smith is decent as always. Asimov's storyline is interesting and the effects are good as well. It's a good, entertaining couple of hours that's worth renting; but not a memorable film that's worth owning unless you're a huge Smith fan or fan of this genre."
3,THE PROBLEM WITH THIS OTHERWISE WELL MADE MOVIE...,"...is that it just doesn't have enough characters. With such a cut and dry theme -- machines taking over, etc etc -- it is imperative to maintain a modicum of realism.While the well-made film offers a delectable blend of CGI and some mild humour along with an unexpected twist, it fails miserably by providing only one hero (and his generic love interest from the lab) who single-handedly saves the day against hordes of robots that crawl out of the woodwork to supposedly take a city under their reins.Wouldn't a real city call for armies or some such well trained forces into action? The end result here is thus too ludicrous to be enjoyable as Will Smith squishes all the machinery to glory all on his own.Watchable rental if you're really into science fiction or a major Smith buff, otherwise a fairly immemorable summer flick."
3,3 stars ... barely,"I like Will Smith, and I read Asimov's original ""I, Robot"" long ago, as a teenager. So I had high hopes for this movie, but they were not fulfilled. The production is pretty good, and the film's basic message is OK -- but the high-speed action sequences aren't even remotely believable, as Will Smith fends off computer-generated robot armies time and again. Not really a bad movie, but it could have been so much better!"
2,"I, Will Smith - forget about anyone else","This movie is a tribute to Will Smith's ego. It hardly resembles the book. It should be titled ""I, Will Smith"", starring Will Smith, co-starring Will Smith, and having a cast of some other people. The plot is ridiculous, never really being established, and it goes down from there. With a little effort, it could have been a comedy instead of just being silly."
4,Very memorable,"This movie was more than I expected. I was astonished at the amazing graphic and effects, and especially, the robots. You are kept wondering who the true villian is until the very end. I did not expect it to be who it was. The reason why I rated this movie a four instead of a five was for the almost constant swearing from Smith. I was not prepared for it, especially since the movie is not rated PG-13 for language. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie."
3,One of the better sci-fi movies,"I would choose ""I, Robot"" over any of the ultra-stupid Star Warz flix of the last six years. This has about as many new ideas, and is approximately as good, as ""The Final Cut"".What's weird about this movie? No kissing - only a sexual attraction hinted at rather than explicitly expressed between the white psychologist and the black lawman. No cursing. And less violence than one might expect given the content. For these reasons, many will judge the movie acceptable for children. Because as everyone knows, childrens' brains explode if exposed to a curse word or worse, kissing.The main annoyance were the blatant commercials for Converse and Audi inserted into the script. The one for Converse in particular was a non-sequitor that detracted from the enjoyment of the movie."
5,True Blu-ray content,"The pictures are detailed and sharp throughout. The dialog, background music, and sound effects (e.g., explosions, physical damage, glass breaking, robot movement) are precise and very clear. The usage of surround speakers is as good as any modern action film.The story line itself is pretty engaging. Good plot. There is some parallels with Star Trek TNG (Data), the good robot goes through self reasoning, realization, and evolve toward better side of humanity. The threats faced humanity from the computer ""conscience"" is repeated many times in previous movies, including the likes of ""War Games"" from the 80s, and the entire Terminator series."
4,Bring on the Sequel!,"A very pleasant surprise, I Robot, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: Robots-and lots of them!But that is not the only thing that there is plenty of; it combines action, adventure and comedy, making this movie definitely worth watching.Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well, though Will Smith does overdo it with his character's ""attitude problem""/ ""Chip on his shoulder""etc; it gets tiring after a while, not to mention unrealistic (e.g. being sarcastic and giving the billionaire owner of the robot company a ""hard time"").Nevertheless, the setting, the plot, and the special effects are all wonderful, not to mention the ending, which is great.Therefore, I would definitely line up to watch a sequel!"
4,"I, Robot","Loved this movie! Would have given it five stars if there had been a little romance thrown in. It was very good, even so."
3,"I, Robot and You, Hollywood","Good popcorn flick, but...It's easier for me to believe that we will have walking, talking robot helpers in the year 2035 than it is for me to believe that only one, lone detective will be worried that they might, potentially be dangerous. Why Hollywood needs to set up these scenarios is beyond me. Take out 1 minute of fluff and give me a couple of short scenes where someone actually agrees with Will Smith's suspicions in the first 30 minutes of the movie...Then I'll give it a solid 4 stars. It would have taken so little for this to have been a movie that both critics and the general public could have gotten behind.This movie could have been smart AND entertaining. Instead, we will have to settle for just entertaining.If you haven't read any Asimov, please do!!"
4,This is a great movie and very enjoyable.,I love science fiction and when it combines great visual effects it great. I saw this in the movie and now glad to have the DVD. It's wonderful entertainment.
3,So Close to Being Very Good,"This was actually better than I thought it would be. There is a lot to like about the movie, with some heavy messages and very good special effects. Exactly how did the good scientist who created the robots die, was it suicide or was he murdered and if so by who? Could it have been robots programmed by a human or are the robots taking over and if so how can that be given the three prinipals that protect humans from harm?This is a well thought out script, my only real problems are with the damn ""HOLLYWOOD"" moments with the hero flying through the air in slow motion with guns ablazing or the chase scenes with the hero oh so close to falling to his death while leaping to catch a precious object but just barely able to hang on (what a surprise).One of those movies I wish the English had made. This one is pretty good but a little too sanitized"
3,Better than expected,"This movie was both different and better than expected. Will Smith does a good job as the detective, but the Robot steals the show.The story line was interesting. Had the writers gone in a different direction, this could have been a great movie. They chose to follow the simpler, entertaining path and made a really good action flick about robots going out of control. The more difficult path would have been an exploration of the robot's evolution and how to define ""life"".Overall it's a good summertime action flick. Worth buying and watching with the kidos."
2,Overhyped,"This movie was a disappointment. If you aren't a science-fiction fan (and maybe if you are) you don't want to see I, ROBOT. It is one of those movies that is slow to get the least bit interesting and truly escalates at the conclusion of the movie. While Isaac Asimov was a great science-fiction writer, I, Robot in its movie version just doesn't cut it. Not even Will Smith can lighten this bland movie, with the exception of the ending. It just lacks in being a truly exciting movie. It seems like for a while it is a mix of drama and science fiction, and then here comes comedy relief from Will Smith. It is way overhyped and could've definitely been better. 2 stars."
4,Decent action sci-fi drama,"Decent, not ground-breaking but highly enjoyable and necessary for today's scientists and their robotic craze."
3,Good action film,"Will Smith is the man. I love his movies and think he's a great movie star. I, Robot has its problems and a lot of flaws but Smith lifts the movie up providing some comic relief in an otherwise pretty serious film. I, Robot creepily reminds us of the mechanization of our lives and the realism that machines are becoming more important than people in our lives.Despite some flaws, the effects are awesome and Will delivers as always. Buy it if you're a Will Smith fan. But action fans will enjoy it either way."
3,An Above Average Sci-Fi,"This film was very good. It was better than most that are coming out nowdays. It is not ""The Matrix"" or anything, but it is very good, and it's fun, and that's cool."
3,"ok action mystery, but mediocre sci-fi","Alas, it is very hard to find great sci-fi these days. This story takes some of Asimov's ideas - the three laws of robotics, which Asimov posited would be inevitable with the advent of intelligent robots - and jazzes them up with special effects while missing the underlieing point (i.e. that the positronic brian is designed so that robots cannot violate them - the three laws can't be turned off without destroying the function of the positronic brain itself). That makes this rather feeble as sci-fi, but good enough for casual viewers who want action and images, which seem all that Hollywood is capable of these days.Recommended tepidly. You can't watch this like 2001 and constantly see more and differently - once you get it, the concept is used up, as is the case with simple who-donnits."
5,Best Hd experience yet,"I own both formats and have viewed more movies on both than I probably should!!! I have to date been more impressed with my movies on hd dvd for picture and audio quality until I Robot, I enjoyed the movie when it came out and took the opportunity to rent the BD release and all I can say is WOW!!! the picture quality is on par with the top tier releases I have viewed! The audio (dts master) is possibly the best I have experienced, clear, crisp, lifelike surround which combined with the picture quality and to me an excellent story makes this overall experience an A+++++! If you are a fan of sci-fi this is a must have for your HD collection!"
4,"Good Movie, Better Book","The producers of this film were so intent on getting Will Smith to star that they changed the story and 'invented' his character. In the book Det. Spooner didn't exist. However, in a world that can 'reinvent' remakes, why not a classic book? That note aside the movie itself is pretty good. Loads of action and spectacular special effects dominate this film. It really moves at a fast clip with confident direction and solid performances by all. It really is a lot of fun to watch, with that ""Independence Day"" popcorn feel. A great way to spend an evening, or rainy day."
4,"Good effects, mediocre writing","The special effects are wonderfully orchestrated in this film and the adapted storyline is refreshing and intruiging. However, Smith's character becomes increasingly annoying as the film progresses. His constant ""I told you so"" attitude is tiring and distracts from the story itself. Worth watching, but by no means a masterpiece."
2,Uggghhh...It hurts so much,"Uggghhhh, that is the noise Isaac Asimov is making as he roles over in his grave. This movie tried to be more than what it was and in the process completely destroyed what Asimov had written. This movie is just a bunch of special effects and little wise cracks from Smith, who is just so funny. For what the movie was, it wasn't that bad, but the director should of left it had that, not try to make it seem like anything more. HTe concept of robots showing emotion and man vs machine,it has been done before, and much better (See ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: a Space Odyessy""). The whole concept has just been beaten to death and instead of bringing something new to the table and breathing life back into the concept, ""I,Robot"" lays it to rest, and then steps on and smashs it some more. For a mindless summer action movie, it is above average, but it tried to be something more hten that, nad it fell flat on its face."
2,Buyer beware!,"A rip-off from Fox. First, all should know that the 3D version of the film has been CROPPED! The widescreen film therefore loses picture information...which is reprehensible considering that this is a visual-effects film. The 3D conversion is just ""meh"" as well. While I'd give the film at least 3 stars, the hatchet job done to the movie by Fox makes it a must to avoid."
4,"I, Robot","Will Smith has become a great action star, showing his ability to draw audiences to watch his action packed movies, such as 'Independence Day' and 'Bad Boys'. This movie is another action packed movie and is taken in the future, and is supposed to be a glimps of what could happen to man kind if machines could think for themselves. And yes, it goes on the same story lines where we struggle with our own creation in movies such as the ""Terminator"" series, etc. Again, we have a movie pointing the potential dangers of machine vs. man, which is the ultimate battle. Besides, some flaws in the movie, where the previews show Will saying to his boss, "" I sure miss the good old days...when people killed people.."" in the movie, they have the boss saying it to Will's character instead. But regardless of the few other mishaps, Will Smith's performance and personality with the great action scences makes up for it."
2,great movie BAD DVD,"The film it's self it great. The story is interesting. The effects are great, no shock there. The DVD only has 2 special features A ""making of"" and commentary. Everything else on the DVD is a bunch of previews. I have never felt the need to write a review of a DVD before but I felt I had to for this one because the DVD is just about the worst one I purchased. If you only care about the film buy it. If you are like me and special features are important don't waste you money. I also worry that the might be makeing a special or collectors edition."
4,"Necessary changes to the book, even if some of the ideas are simplified","Lets face it, I, Robot the Asimov text would not make a great film, even if it were a great book. This attempts to sew the ideas in that book into an all encompassing package.On the whole, it succeeds. It is not perfect, but stands ahead of most of the superhero movies of the last 15 years and is up there among the better movies of the action genre. And Will Smith makes a good transition from comic to serious role."
4,"High Action, High Interest Science Fiction With Food for Thought","Based on Isaac Asimov's robot short stories, this movie moves at a fast pace and holds one's interest. Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) has his reasons for hating robots and sets out to prove that one of them killed a famous USR (United States Robotics) scientist. There are interesting twists and subplots which successfully blur the real instigator of an escalating attempt by robots to rule humans. There is food for thought here, too. What is life? And if we create a robot that can feel and think and plan, do we have the right to destroy it? This movie is good for sheer entertainment, but one has the option of going deeper into the questions the story presents. There is violence against both man and robot, therefore it may not be suitable for those under 10."
5,"I, Robot",Loved it! Will Smith too this part an work it. The story line an plot were good to me. A keeper
4,"Great story, some not so great acting","i must say the worst part of this movie is the female lead of the film. i can't say i know if it's supposed to be that way but all i can say is her acting wasn't good. but i think Will di an awsome job! he was funny, stern, and at times intimidating. to bad all cops aren't like him. the robot, well there isn't much to say bout acting there cuz we really don't know what they sound like. but i thought it had a good artificial sounding voice. overall a well made movie....."
4,Good Sci-Fi Thriller,"""I,Robot"" offers interesting hypotheses about man and his relationship to his creations but ultimately this film is essentially a popcorn film with some pretensions. If it's primarily an action film then director Alex Proyas has achieved his primary goal of entertaining the audience. If it is a serious exploration of the nature of artificial intelligence then it suffers somewhat in comparison to films such as ""Blade Runner"" and ""A.I."". Will Smith continues to grow as both an actor and an action-star here. His down-to-earth quality helps to cut through alot of the pretenses of the film. The CGI effects are excellent here. I feared at some point that the robot animation would overwhelm the flesh-and-blood actors on the screen. This film is not destined to be a classic of the genre but that should not detract anyone from accepting it for what it is and have a good time."
3,An okay movie...,This movie is okay. The speical effects were awesome the actors were good but it just felt like I was missing something when watching it. I did like it just not well enough to own it which I did buy it because I had never seen it before and thought it looked good. I would recommend going out and renting it first because like me you may not feel this is a movie to own just more of a one time thing.
3,Average at best,"I'm glad I rented this movie, and didn't buy it. It had it's moments, but it wasn't enough to make me watch the special features, let alone watch the movie twice. I have to say I was glad when the movie ended, so that I could watch something else. I rarely leave movies unfinished, but this was a very tedious movie. The visual and sound effects might have made it an excellent theatrical experience, but watching it on a 19"" with stereo speakers left a lot to be desired."
1,Hollywood doo doo,"Just another overblown, overspecial effected, hollywood mess with very little thought to good plot or dialogue. And that actress is not attractive enough for a movie with this budget. And Will Smith needs to spend less time in the weight room and more time in an acting class. And all this old fashioned Sci-Fi just doesn't make good movies today. (see war of worlds)"
1,"I, Bored",A big screen video game. No characterization. Effects that are obviously computer generated. Such effects are inversely proportional to tension and anticipation. What a waste.
1,wow. this is a boring movie....,"a friend loaned this to me over the weekend and i watched it on my laptop while enroute from LAX to JFK. after the first 30 minutes, i had the urge to quit and do something else as this is really a boring movie. the plot is predictabile, the same machine vs. men, humanity and love to all, hug the tree kind of deal. as i already 'wasted' over half an hour on this movie, i decided to stay put and finish the movie... only to find out that the boredom continued. even worse, this movie has no humor, takes itself too seriously as if the director has something to preach..... come to think of it, one star is too much but then, this is the lowest rating Amazon has for us. can we have negative 5 stars in the future?"
1,Horrible injustice to Asimov,"This movie is terrible.Its just another formulaic piece of hollywood crap. Its a good thing Asimov is dead because he would have died after seeing this horrible movie supposedly based on his novel. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, and I only gave it one star because you cant give zero stars. The writers,directors,producers,and actors in this movie should be ashamed!!!"
3,Moderately entertaining,This movie is moderately entertaining. Better than I thought it would be. Somewhat predicable. If you like sci-fi then you will enjoy it more.
2,Not Even The Same Story As The Book!!!,"The story is totally different than the book. All they took was the name and a couple of the characters.The story was pretty much a rip-off of the Terminator. Just think about it.(...) What is this thing next to the what, who did this and why?"
2,"How about ""Oops, Robot"", instead?","Let me put it plainly: this movie gave as much of a hard time as Swordfish and A.I. combined, two of my least favorite movies in recent times. It feels like a waste of a good story and some great acting (Will Smith's) on a poor screenplay where the effects are (sometimes) the only interesting thing in the movie (the reason I don't give it 1 star only). Never mind the product placement which becomes fairly annoying after a few minutes... The movie goes into unbelievable mode far too quick, plus it has a tough time retaining your attention.For the record, I am not an outright critic of SciFi. I am a fan of the genre, but movies such as Bladerunner and more recently, Minority Report, really do it justice. And I LOVED Alex Proyas' work with ""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"", but ""I, Robot"" instead felt more like ""Oops, Robot"". Do yourself a favor and skip it altogether."
4,Blu-Ray Technical Specs,"I, Robot [Blu-ray]Feature film Blu-Ray technical specifications:Video: 1080p, 2.35:1Audio:* English dts-HD Master Audio 5.1* Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1* French Dolby Digital 5.1I'm hopeful that Amazon's technical specifications listings will become more useful."
2,Disappointed...,"Wow... I was expecting much more than this. The story is weak and has little foundation: It's makes things overly complex just to take up time, and the whole three laws thing was just plain stupid. The movie is all Will Smith frowning and being an idiot! I was expecting exciting combat sequences, with murderous robots in an out of control society. Instead, all i saw was an over-complexified paranoia fest, with pidly little robots scenes with, and then it went right back to will smith! The only really redeemable thing about this movie that stopped me from giving it 1 stars was the fact that the visuals were so darn cool! Apart from that though, there really isn't any depth or quality to this one. With great sci-fi movies out there like the matrix series and others, I don't know how I could recommend this to anyone."
2,"Runs large, fairly slow to ship","This shirt runs large. The color is not the same as what is depicted in the image here (look beige in the picture, but has a greenish cast in reality), otherwise the quality is alright.Also, having been spoiled by Amazon and Costco, more than a week (9 days), for an item to arrive seems a long wait."
3,Only if you are a Syd fan,"The only reason that i bought this collection is because Barrett was the founder of Pink Floyd. So here Syd has ""lost"" his psychedelic playing style and in the most songs he uses just his guitar and nothing else! Ok there are some good songs but do now wait to hear Pink Floyd music."
5,Objective and sensitive,"My wife and I have found Dr. Uribe's latest book to be an objective, yet sensitive guide to dealing with many issues of child rearing. Dr. Uribe's clinical credentials are obvious from his academic training, vast professional experience and prior writings, but this latest effort clearly demonstrates the sensitivity only achievable via parenting one's own children. It is nice to have found a resource that combines clinical research with parental common sense. Well done!"
2,"Good Ideas, Empty Writing","This had all the elements that had me excited: magic as a disease, a gateway to two modern cities, and cool non-white characters. An aboriginal heroine! Please let it be good!Then I read the book. It's not difficult to get into, as the writing's smooth enough (rather too simple) but there's not much of it, as if you've added only one spoon of the chocolate mix when you need to add five to have something delicious. Events, scenes, plot, were all stretched out, probably to fit three books instead of one. And that's where it got boring, and rather weak. Not a dense, beautiful world that's brimming over with fantasy.Rather than magic, or the premise (which is exciting at first, then you wonder WHY does it take the character 250 pages to find out what the reader picked up at page 20), the book seemed more interested in fooling around with the minor differences between American and Australian English."
3,Better then I can write,It was a good book but not great. I just did not know who was good or bad and it never makes it clear. Maybe you have to read the next book to get a bigger picture.
4,Good Black Music,"This is good ole black music, the way it's used to be. Give it a try. I don't think be disappointed."
2,Might help if you have read Dufresne's previous books before,"The book started out interestingly enough, informing the readers about the last surviving member of a New Orleanian clan, before continuing to the meat of the story, which is an upcoming family wedding. The author explores the thoughts and experiences of many characters, which can be confusing. The book even has an supplemental information section at the end of the book that contains materials that might aid in the understanding of what's going on.When reading the book, I got the sense that if I had read Dufresne's previous work about the same clan of characters, that I would've followed the story better. It's not too bad a book if there's nothing else to read."
5,DEEP IN THE SHADE OF PARADISE,"THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST MOVING, LAUGH OUT LOUD BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I FELL IN LOVE WITH THESE QUIRKY CHARACTERS. THEY BECAME A PART OF MY LIFE. IT'S HARD TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN AND YET I DIDN'T WANT THE STORY TO END. I STILL THINK ABOUT BOUDOU, EARLENE, ADLAI AND MIRANDA (TO NAME A FEW.) AND WONDER WHAT THEY ARE DOING TODAY. I MISS ROYCE AND BENNING. BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN. DUFRESNE LEAVES YOU WANTING MORE."
4,Would've Been 5 Starts if not for Louisiana Power & Light,"It took me a while to finally get around to reading ""Deep in the Shade of Paradise"" but am I ever glad I did! The characters are so quirky, colorful and yet insightful. Dufresne is a master Southern storyteller. This is one of those books that you think would make a good movie or play because it's SO AWESOME and you realize that the reason it's so awesome is that more is felt, dreamt, and imagined than said.As I said in my review title, this would've earned 5 stars if it wasn't for Louisiana Power & Light. The only downside to this book is that when I finished the book I didn't find myself missing the characters as much as I did when I finished LP&L."
5,"7th Grade Book Review by Chris from Pacifica, California","The book Rowan of Rin and the Keeper of the Crystal, is about a boy named Rowan and his mother who have to go to Maris and choose the keeper of the crystal. On the way, his mother is poisened, he has to find the cure, choose the keeper, and escape a serpent.There are a couple of messages in this story and they are that love can conquer anything and that you should never betray anyone no matter how much you hate something or love something.The author did a great job at making the characters come to life and making the story dramitic.Although there is good story line and a couple of messages, it is not one of the better stories in the series."
1,Don't bother with the Kindle sample,"The kindle sample is totally useless. Based on other reviews I wanted to find out if there were any color plates in the kindle edition. All you get is one page, the table of contents, with links that ALL go to the same message offering to sell the book."
3,Disappointed,"I also found this book to be disappointing due to the lack of illustrations. The content was very interesting and I learned alot of the history ,but without the illustrations it was not as good. Examples of what was being talked about would have been helpful."
3,Missing illustrations found here,"This book is a ""Project Gutenburg"" book. Google the title and go to the ""project Gutenburg"" link to read it and see the illustrations online. The ""archive.org"" link will allow you to download the book to your computer. The download is free. They have two formats for Kindle users, one with illustrations and one without."
3,Rating,"Just wasn't what I expected, not my favorite, but will refer to it if need be. Not really sure what I expected."
2,Disappointing,"Virtuoso bass player (capable of great things with Chick Corea, Weather Report and Jan Garbarek to name a few) floats off on a fairly self indulgent set. Aided and abetted by Don Alias (great) and lots of keyboard overdubs it has its moments but ultimately is disappointing."
4,"Too much set up, not enough pay off","This book is the story of Sally and her sister Gillian. Sally and Gillian were orphaned when they were younger and raised by their aunts who were the town witches. The girls' childhood was hard and both looked forward to a time when they could leave the staring and name calling and mean spiritedness behind.The writing in this book has a magical quality to it, although there isn't that much magic mentioned in the book. I would have liked more 'magic' sort of like in the movie. Another thing that bothered me about the book was that they spent a majority of the book setting up the big problem and it all got resolved within a few pages and tied up nicely with a little bow. That part just seemed rushed.I did like reading more about Sally and more about her daughters. I liked the charm that Hoffman brought to the novel and I would be interested in reading more of her work."
3,See the movie,"It's a very rare day when I suggest seeing the movie...I read the book first and was only mildly impressed. The story is interesting, but not well written. The movie does a much more compelling job of telling the story and requires a more appropriate level of intellectual commitment."
2,Where's the magic?,"Very little actual magic, practical or otherwise is included in this overly sentimental and boring story about sisters who grow up under the stigma of being witches. There's crying aplenty as EVERY single character breaks into tears at the drop of a hat. You read and read waiting for something to HAPPEN, but nothing interesting ever does. This is one case in which the movie was much better than the book."
4,"Astonishing, beautiful","This book truly touched me; it stirs thoughts of past, present and future and gives a new appreciation for the depth and beauty, the sadness and poignancy of them all. I would recommend this book to anyone I knew who enjoyed thoroughly touching, viscerally romantic stories about /people./"
1,SHE VIOLATES EVERY RULE I LEARNED ABOUT WRITING,"I'm reading this book because my book club choose it. It's mostly narrartive. There are no scenes of action and very little dialogue. Then in part two the author switches to using the present tense which is an irrating tense to read in and certainly didn't make the story ""now"". I kept waiting for the real story to happen, but it doesn't. One thing, if writing this bad can be acclaimed, maybe my efforts have hope. I won't read another of her books."
1,Ugh! What a travesty that this book was published!,"Drag, drag, drag. I kept reading for two reasons: the first, I had nothing better to do one Sunday, and the second, I kept hoping something significant would happen. It didn't. This story had no climax, no capture, no passion. Who wants to read about the somber day to day lives of boring spinsters? (Of course I did, what a waste). Alice Hoffman is off my reading list. Her use of profanity was unwarranted and did not emphasize meaning in anything. Her characters were flat and the overall flow was slow if not stagnant. The ending was short and curt, as if she was just as bored writing it as it was to read. Unremarkable!"
5,A grown-up bedtime story,"I loved this book since the beginning. Is a sweet, moody fairy tale about a family of witches. If you are expecting to find stories of wild revenge, outrageous love potions and dazzling spells, read something else; this story is very smooth and serene, with a kind of quiet charm that is impossible to ignore. It will be hard for you not to believe in magic after you have read this book."
1,"A Bad Julia Childs meets a bad Anne Rice, where's Hoffman?","I love Alice Hoffman but think this is the worst book I have ever read by her. There are so many refrences to food and stupid ones that it reads like a bad Julia Childs cookbook, and the only magic in this book is omens. Omens like swans and black cats, a bad Anne Rice. Aside from this the story is weak and without a point. Where is the Hoffman I enjoy?"
1,Not particularly impressive!!!,I simply don't know what all the fuss is about. Alice Hoffman's style of writing does not impress me in the least. Where's the dialogue!
5,A Must Read,"This is the first Alice Hoffman novel I've read and I really loved it. It was at times magical, dark, thought-provoking, and dream-like but most of all, an excellent read. I can't wait to read her other novels!!"
3,Not very magical,"I read this book because I loved the movie. I find that I almost always love the book more than the movie, however I can't say so in this case. Of course many things were different which was to be expected. I didn't go into reading the book thinking that it would be the same. I was hoping it would be more magical and was disappointed. I probably should have read the book first. I would read another Alice Hoffman as I did enjoy the writing."
3,Okay. Nothing Special.,"Okay, maybe I'm a little late in reading this... Did a bad thing and saw the movie first, but I was a kid when it came out so I have a decent excuse. (Loved the movie by the way.) But I'm still not 100% sure if I liked Practical Magic.The story is wonderful. Adult fairy tale with beautifully written characters and some pretty bad ass imagery. Buuuttt (there's always a but), I felt really disconnected. I didn't feel like part of the story, and as a major book-lover, that's a big no-no. I just wasn't sure what the hell was going on. Haven't read any other Alice Hoffman books and people just love her, so I guess I was a little disappointed by the whole thing.Glad I finally read it, but a Hoffman fan was not born. Maybe I should have another go at something else of hers. Any recommendations?[...]"
5,Fairy Tale for Adult Children,"If you are looking for a fantasy that will keep you engrossed, you will find it here. Practical Magic is a fairy tale for adults. Like all of Ms. Hoffman's books, it is a sheer reading delight.The characters in the book are endearing. The elderly aunts in the story are like eccentric good witches of the north. The story is absolutely engaging. This is as good a book as any of Ms. Hoffman's with which to begin.Ms. Hoffman has a gift for exploring human relationships in such a way that is uplifting to the soul. From that standpoint, this book is a deeply spiritual one. As the author of a series of books with a spiritual theme, I especially appreciated that. You will love this book if you have a sentimental bone in your body.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of ""The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude"""
3,I like how it makes me feel.,"It's true, it's true: Alice Hoffman is a lazy writer. I have now read three of her books where people ""spoil cats with cream"" -- and once caught the reference twice in the SAME book assigned to two different characters! But that aside, I'll just say that I read her books for the way they make me feel. They make me think my life has more possibility. They make me think magic (meaning, to me, you can get what you want, things have a way or turning out, or that sometimes you can believe that life is good) is possible. And that's pretty rare! Sure, it's true, every woman in her book is THE most beautiful woman in the world, so beautiful the teenage boys line up and go all moony-eyed. But who hasn't imagined herself to be exactly that way? And don't jump all over me; I am a college-educated, early-'30s writer, rampant liberal and a feminist! I like them anyway."
3,I guess I missed it.,"Apparently I missed the point. I was expecting something with witchcarft in it ( judging by the commercials for the movie ). While the book was not a bad book, it just wasn't what I expected."
3,I don't know how I feel about this book,"This book seemed really awesome at first. The story line is interesting and the characters are also. I felt it was really in depth about some points but lacked in other areas. I found myself thinking that it was trying to be a ""romance novel"" and just threw in sex scenes whenever possible, making it more of a weak story. I was surprised that it was so much more R rated than the movie. Another part of me was pleasantly surprised that it was so different from the movie since I still could get into it without only thinking of the movie. Overall I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone unless they liked somewhat... I hate to say trashy... romance novels. If you do then it's great! Plus it has a cool story along with it."
3,Ok book.,"I liked the book ok, but it deviated from the movie in ways that were a bit confusing. But overall, I like to read so it wasn't bad."
4,MUCH Better Than The Movie,"I usually read the book first, but I had seen the move ""Practical Magic"" and thought it was terrible, so I had no desire to read the book. It kind of fell in my lap one day, though, and I thought I would give it a chance. So glad I did! Walker's writing is absolutely beautiful, and she really can create a mood and an image through her use of words. There is none of the hokey, aww-how-cute stuff that marred the movie so badly, and I found the characters much more believable and human. I also liked that Sally's children were older and had a bigger part in the story. There is magic in the store, but it's much more subtle and the aunts actually do resemble an old-time ""cunning woman"" or village witch. I highly recommend this book. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is for the ending; it wraps up a little too neatly, and I felt that some of the characters behaved in an unrealistic way."
2,So where's the magic?,"I read this, got done and said 'Huh? Did I miss the point?' I'm sure someone else would say 'Oh it's a character study.' Me - I like a plot. There didn't seem to be much of one here."
4,Book order,The story wasn't that interesting to me. It was a book club choice so I read it. Can't really recommend it.
3,Good views on desire and love,"This book was okay. It had a new look on desire, love, and obsession that was fairly interesting, and it had a good perspective on being young and beautiful. However, I thought that the narrative seemed to wander a bit, and I often wondered when it would actually get to the real story, which it never seemed to do. Despite these faults, I found the book Practical Magic to be somewhat entertaining, and a nice way to pass an afternoon."
4,Great fairy tale,"This is my first Alice Hoffman book, and I was pleasantly surprised. This book is a fairy tale that explores the magical occurrences in the lives of sisters (2 main pairs). It reminds of the magic realism style of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and other Latin American writers.Ms. Hoffman weaves a beautiful, interesting world where good and bad things happen. Add a layer of magic and you end up with a fun book to read.Some people may find the book to be slow and plotless. It certainly is not the fastest book ever, but its slowness adds a silkiness that envelops you as you read and enter this world.As to it being plotless, I disagree. It's not your average genre plot. It's a character study showing you how the main characters react to new obstacles and themselves.All in all, I highly recommend it.If you liked this book, I also recommend Laura Esquivel's ""Like Water For Chocolate.""Enjoy"
4,A potent spell,"When I read Garden Spells by Sarah Addison Allen, a number of the reviews compared it to Practical Magic, complaining about how similar the two books are, so I eagerly put this on my to-read list. While I certainly see the similarities--sisters raised by witches trying to find their place in a modern world, one the stay-at-home and the other the wayward spirit, etc.--the tone is very different. This is the darker twin, edging into horror at times. While there is romance, it tends toward the sudden and overwhelming, rather than sweet. The narrative passes smoothly between past and present, history and current events, and the writing is lyrical and moody, but the ending comes almost too suddenly. A good book for a hot night, waiting for the storm."
2,"Sadly, this is one of those times where the movie is better than the book.","The author writes with an omnipresent/fairy tale voice that sometimes works in short stories, but becomes grating in novels. The characters are bizarre, not charming, with the aunts being creepy hags, Gillian a self-centered jerk, and Sally a sad sack who raises two brats. Worst of all? No real magic is presented (at least in the parts I manged to read).I got through 28% of the book on my Kindle before I got tired of waiting for the plot to show up"
1,The First Time a Movie May Be Better Than A Book,"I did not like this book. Not one bit. I study the occult and the occult references in the book were hazy at best, but that is acceptable since it is meant for mainstream consumption. What got to me most about this book is that there is almost no dialog, there are periods where there are three pages without dialog, without vaugely meaninful description (like say Moby Dick), but just pure nariation. The book is written from an omni-scentiant point of view, so it is hard to care very much about any one of the characters as a main character. Now perhaps it is acceptable for Clancy to have five main characters, when he writes a 900 page book, but this book being around 250, can't support the lack of focus."
1,A Big Disappointment,"After being drawn in by the magical possibilities of a Rossetti painting on the dustjacket (of the hardcover) and an epigraph from Mother Goose, I was disappointed that what followed was sheer hokum. Most disappointing: the characters are based on cliched ideas. For example, the author reinforces the tired dichotomy that women are either rational and practical or wild and irresponsible. And the author's primary characterization of all the prominent females in the book is that they are stunningly beautiful, as if she has nothing else in her bag of tricks to make them likable. This is a world where a woman must use her beauty to secure the love of a handsome man before she can like herself, and that is very unfortunate given the possibilities for strong feminine characters in such a storyline. The ending is likewise predictable and cloying, which seems to be a prerequisite for authors who eventually end up in the ""Oprah Bookclub."""
3,An okay base for a movie.,"I watched the movie first never knowing that there was a book that this movie was based on. I loved the movie, I really believe that this was the first time I was glad ""hollywood"" changed things in the book to make this book stand apart from the rest. Made it more believable and realistic. I was not so enamored of the book. My mother always said that to get through a few chapters you'll find something to catch your interest, nothing in this book captured my interest. It was boring and uneventful, like everyday life. Sometimes we like to take a trip through the writers eyes and enjoy the scenery and the drama for something outside our lives and this for me just was not it."
3,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: Loved the movie.What impressed me: I loved the characters, the magic and the obviously deeper meaning that family is more powerful than any magical ability. This was an extremely well-written book.What disappointed me: I really, really loved the movie adaptation and the book just didn't give off the same vibe. It was sort of stuffier, less light-hearted at times and just not all that easy to get through. It was just way more serious than I was expecting or wanting.Recommended: Yes, but only for those who didn't see and absolutely love the movie."
3,not her best.,"This isn't Haffman's best, but was still a desent read. I would reccomend it to someone who wasn't expecting anytihng like the movie."
4,"Unlike some, I loved the book...hated the movie","I found TURTLE MOON and SECOND NATURE at a used book store and have been an Alice Hoffman fan ever since.PRACTICAL MAGIC is one my favorite Hoffman stories because of the quirky characters and off-beat plot.The movie, however, did the book no justice, except in the casting of Stockard Channing and Dianne Weist as the 'aunts.' They were dead on. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman just didn't do it for me.If you want a good read for the beach or a stormy summer night, this book is for you. Hoffman continues to turn out quality work...she's one of the best.Enjoy!"
3,:O),This book was more about sisters and the power of females than it was about magic. If they wernt all so self absorbed the plot might have gone somewhere but they spent most of the time bickering over clothes and who was prettier. It was ok but I wouldnt read it again.
4,Fairy Tale Classic,"The people who've been giving this book a negative review must never have had fairytales told to them during scary thunderstorm nights. It has that sort of quiet, thoughtful quality. The ""frightening"" part was how much the sisters lives are like my own family's life. I read it twice in as many days, finding something new in it both times. It's meant only to make you stop and think for a moment."
3,The movie was better,"I admit that I saw the movie before I read the book and to be honest was a little disappointed in the book. I felt that it just lacked the drama to keep the reader interested. I kind of felt that the Aunts were just a side part of the book and they should not have been. I also felt that it wasn't clearly portrayed that both Sally and Gillian were ""witches"" and why Sally was so determined to not bring her girls up that way. I also felt the appearance of Gary didn't make any sense since he was only in the last three chapters and his character was never developed beyond a side character to whom Sally falls in love with. We don't know why she falls in love she just does. To her credit Ms. Hoffman is a remarkable writer and I would purchase books by her again."
4,A Delight!,"Once again, Alice Hoffman has given us a delightfully charming story that starts out as a fairy tale and becomes true life extraordinary. Her books are so magical,that once you begin, you are caught in a spell that doesn't allow you to put down the book until the last page has been turned."
3,"Oh no, something is missing!","Yes, it seems to me that a male person really misses something essential about this book. I've just read a load of praising reviews by female readers, and it's all very confusing: I didn't find any special magic in this book, though it's well written and not boring in any sense. I think the endless and ever-so-deadly love affairs make this a comedy. The emotions are so overwhelmingly powerful that they aren't simply realistic. Well, that goes for entertainment, but this is not a masterpiece, believe me."
1,"I DID NOT LIKE THE BOOK, COULD NOT FINISH IT","I have seen the movie and love it. I also have the soundtrack to the movie and love that. I got about half way thru the book and just stopped. I did not like the authors writing style, from a third person point of view. I could not get inside the characters because the book was not told from one of their view- points. Also, it did not flow smoothly for me. The story jumped around and did not unfold evenly. I was very disappointed. This is one case where the movie was much better than the book."
3,Most things I LOVED about the film...were missing from the book,"I would have to place Practical Magic on my top FIVE list of favorite films (The Goonies, Harry Potter, The Secret Garden & Titanic...are also on that list). I love the setting, the mood and the all around feel I have when I watch this movie-those who have seen it know exactly what I mean! I decided to pick up the book, thinking 'how could I not love it?' but behold...I have never seen such a difference between book and film...EVER. Not to say that I didn't like the book, but it was missing everything I loved about ""Practical Magic."" In the film it was real magic...in the book it seemed more like silly little love 'spells' that aunts liked to do in their spare time. The magic was gone...the whole air and feeling...gone. The book was okay and in general I am thankful that it was written...because I love the film!"
2,should have been better...,"I have always liked the movie with Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock and I was expecting a very satisfying read. Unfortunately, Practical Magic proved to be a disappointment with its bland characters, loose plot and childish, simplistic tone. Gillian and Sally are one dimensional and mostly just pathetic. Although Sally's daughters are better portrayed than the grown up characters, teenage depression is simply not enough to save a lagging story. Jimmy and his angry ghost, the aunts, the conservative little town the girls grew up and Sally's love interest have very little place in the book and this does not help either.The only real success of the novel is Alice Hoffman's ability to ""feed"" magical realism into an impossible place such as the lower middle class American suburbia. Still, this does not compensate for a story that has no charm within itself."
4,Interesting combination of fantasy and real life drama.,I read this book before it was made into a movie and found it to be an interesting combination of fantasy and real life situations. The Owens' sisters witchcraft allowed them to do what many of us wished we could do when faced with various situations in our life.
2,"Decent, but I've definitely read better novels","Though the time periods and character viewpoints jump around too much, this novel about a NE family of psuedo- witches is full of lush, evocative description. I enjoyed the many descriptions of food, plants and weather, and agree it is similar to Like Water For Chocolate.However, I also agree the plot is somewhat weak, the women too obviously beautiful and somewhat lacking in real personality. This I would blame on the disappointing lack of dialogue in Practical Magic. The men are basically flat. Lust seems to be more important than love--the author seems to want to drive the point home that you cannot escape lust/love no matter how hard you try. I didn't really learn anything from this novel, especially not anything to do with Wicca, witchcraft, or New Age philosophy.Overall it's a pretty good read if you're not too fussy."
2,I just finished the book........,"and after mulling it over I think that the book was OK, but not great. I admit I did see the movie several times before I bought the book, and they are VERY different from one another. The movie was much more dramatic, whereas the book(for me) moved very slowly. the aunts were not very promiant. There was barely any magic in the book and it didn't seem like much of a love story, Gary only shows up near the end. I didn't care about the characters, unlike the movie where it made me ache to have a sister! So, I went and bought the movie! I'm quite happy now."
3,View as a different entity from the movie,"This book was enjoyable but if you are a fan of the movie then you might want to wait for a while to read this when the movie isn't so fresh in your mind. They expand a lot more on the daughters of Sally which I really loved but it isn't a quick read book & can get laborous. Still good, glad I finished it."
4,Interesting read,"This was my first Alice Hoffman book, and I have been hooked ever since.If you are looking for the movie in print, you have found the WRONG book! Though the same basic idea is still there, the book is a separate entity from the movie.I enjoyed every page of the book. I found the writing so well presented that I read as slow as possible, just to relish every word.The characters are more lovable than in the movie, and I found the story of two sisters magical.This is a must-read for anyone who enjoys reading mysticism."
4,"Good read, not the movie","While I enjoyed this book for what it was, I was surprised by how it was nothing like the movie. However that was honestly my only complaint; I would heartily recommend for those long, lazy rainy days."
4,Better Story Line than the Movie,"I found I liked the book better than the movie even though I'm not entirely thrilled with the author's style of writing which is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. The story fits together much nicer and makes more sense. The ending is better than the movie, too. Probably the only thread that I liked better in the movie and that I missed in the book was Sally's wish for her ideal man and the daughters manipulation to bring them together. This is a fairly good love story(s)."
2,The weakest in the Angelina series,"In ""Angelina's Baby Sister"", the arrival of baby sister Polly has Angelina resorting to temper tantrums and bad behavior to get her parents' attention. I felt this was the weakest of all the books in the Angelina series due to a number of reasons: the adults seem to ignore Angelina without reassuring her from the beginning, Angelina says some very harsh words about her baby sister and uses the word ""hate"" which I deem too harsh for my preschooler to hear [she has no real concept of what the word means as she hardly ever hears it used], and in the end Angelina throws a full-scale temper tantrum, destroying her room in order to vent her anger which also seems a bit extreme.My 4-year-old and I love the books in the Angelina series and it's too bad that this particular book was written without too much thought put into it. The others in the series are much better, but if you're new to the series, you may want to skip this."
1,Horrible and frustrating waste of money,"Every single one of these ties has snapped. Perhaps I am using them too much, but I didn't see a disclaimer saying that they were only for light use. I will just use fabric wrapped hair ties from now on. Frustrating!"
2,Difficult to Work With,"I'm new to using frost and icing tools. So, I bough these ties thinking I might need them. No. They are difficult to use. Just learn to get the hang of working with the bag. These are really not needed."
1,You could use any elastic tie to close the bags...,This is overpriced! Any given elastic band/ties would do the job just fine and would cost 1/10 of the price of these.
3,they are ok,I still feel that you can do same effect using a hair band. The tinny ones that are cheapper. I believe you would get same results.
5,Good Buy!,"I bought this 3 years ago, and it still works fine until now. Honestly it exceeded my expectation this vacuum cleaner cleans very well with good suction, for all 3 different homes, one with tiles, one with carpet, and now laminate floor. I use it almost everyday, I lived in Miami and now reside Hawaii, we take home sand quite often. For the price I have no complain, although I'd like it better if the handle were adjustable, but that's not really a con. If mine were ever broken, I'd buy this very same thing again."
4,Tough but not heavy vacuum,It's fun and cute with easy handling.The power is not so strong but enough if traced twice.My room looks fabulous after getting this vacuum!
2,it's not broken but it keeps falling apart,"The long tube that's supposed to nest into the longer bits of the tube or the attachments does not fit well enough. During ten minutes of vacuuming, I probably have to pick up falling pieces about three or four times. The two attachments (a brush and angled-looking thing) also fall off (as does the head of the vacuum) and do not fit easily back into their holding place in the canister. The canister doesn't roll so much as gets dragged behind you since it constantly flips onto its side. The vacuum also takes up a surprising amount of storage space since the tube loops out from the body. In addition, the vacuum is difficult to get in and out of storage because the tube merely rests in place so it gets easily knocked over. There is also no good way to carry the vacuum when not in use. I really really really hate this vacuum."
4,vacuum,"I had bought a stand up vacuum($177) last year that Consumer Report rated high. What a disaster!!!!!!!!! It was too heavy for me and it was difficult to use and it burned the fringe on my oriental rug. I borrowed a friend's Panasonic, loved it and immediately ordered one. I can lift it with one finger; the suction is strong but does not destroy fringe and it takes little storage space. My apt is now cleaner than ever because I can do my rugs myself without hiring someone or getting a friend to vacuum -out of desperation! I had difficulty giving away my old vacuum because it was too heavy for people-even a 6 ft guy. The PANASONIC does turn over fairly easily but nothing is perfect and the price is very affordable."
2,On/off switch broke,Nice vacuum. Easy light but poor quality. The on/off switch broke after 6 months. Also cord is too short.Closest repair center is at >20 miles. Not worth the effort for a $60 vacuum. Doubting whether to buy the same one again of a more expensive Miele.
2,"Great hat, poor service.","This item was ordered the afternoon of Dec. 19th 2012 as a Christmas gift. They shipped the item Dec. 24th! Didn't receive it until January 2nd. Cap is perfect fit and excellent embroidery.Different color was purchased separately, knowing it was late but still as another gift for the holidays. (Red with yellow flame cap) Ordered on Dec. 21st. Shipped on Dec 27th. Received it January 5th. Cap was frayed at not less than 5 spots in the embroidery. Pay for shipping yet again? Not worth it...Very irritated with this vendor"
1,Won't last long!,"Save your money! It will be strong at first, but won't last anywhere near the original battery power. You'll be lucky if you get several months out of this thing. I wound up charging it as much as my old one that was dying. It's smarter and cheaper to just buy a new phone when it's time to re-new your plan, like I did."
1,DuD,This was a nice looking timer but right out of the box was a DUD.Would not work at all at first.Then it started working after bending the a/c prongs a bit.Ran about 6 hr. with pump and it got hot and quit.Will trash this as its not worth going through the return crap.
1,Chinese Junk !!!!!!!!!,"I've tried everything possible to make this unit work. I had no success. I found an old unit which was a model P1101P built by INTERMATICINCORPORATED that was built in Spring Grove Illinois, USA. Not built by China I'm using it!!!!!!!! I want nothing more from CHINA !!!!!!!!"
5,Good replacement,Bought this timer to replace the previous one I had for 10 years which finally gave out. This timer is Identical to my old one. Works great.
5,enjoyable 5th,"I don't know if this is the definitive version of Bruckner's 5th, but I really enjoy this release. The sound quality and balance are excellent. The reading is controlled, but dynamic. This has to be the most difficult Bruckner symphony to critique because it is definitely a most unusual work, but I love it! When I want to listen to the 5th from Bruckner, I usually pop this one into my player. The Thielemann 5th (on DG) is also excellent, but it is sadly not SACD even though the sonics are still excellent. If DG decides to release the Thielemann on SACD I will definitely buy it, but I would still keep this one."
3,Good for the money but average overall,"I actually bought the 3284 model which has the 3259's tube with a few extra whistles and bells. The picture quality is decent and the sound is satisfactory but I completely agree with the reviewer who experienced problems with vertical white and black bars continuously appearing when using a video input source including DVD players. It's rather annoying but can be eliminated by reducing the contrast, but you lost picture quality in so-doing. This is very frustrating but overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase considering the price. I actually don't have cable or satellite )= but this TV picks up local stations rather well (much better than my previous top of the line JVC 27090 27"" TV). Anyway, it's a good TV for the budget-minded but it's no Sony and despite Philips' boastings, it is NOT a flat screen TV. If you want a decent (nothing more) 32 inch picture for a modest price- it's a good buy."
2,Not good when using video sources,"The picture is fine when using the cable jack, but when watching a DVD or VHS hooked up through the video in jacks, there are white vertical bars on the screen. They are very noticeable when the background is dark and especially when watching a wide screen DVD with the black areas on top and bottom. I took mine back and was going to try another of the same model, but even the demo in the store I was in did the same thing. I eventually bought a different brand because of this."
3,"careful guys, things can happen","I am going to share about the model TS3258C 32"" Picture is good, sound is good. Auto clock does not work since day one (always sets a wrong time). After I set up a clock in the manual mode then a few hours later TV changed the clock by itself. It can do it randomly without any power glitches. Never've seen such a problem before. Captions also are scrambled sometimes. Remote is small and unconvenient."
4,Nice plant for a great price,"The plant looks very much as pictured, very realistic. The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because though the tops of the leaves are gorgeous the underside of all the leaves aren't painted and are pretty cheezy looking - and where my tank is at you'll be able to see that. But! I still love it, looks great otherwise."
3,They're OK,"I purchased 2 of these for my betta's 5.5 gallon aquarium.They somewhat look realistic, which i like & they liven up the aquariumI took away 2 stars because the price for these is a bit too expensive, also one of the leaf came off & wouldn't stay attached when i tried fixing it,but most importantly, one day after adding these plants, my betta was missing a scale from the top of his head. i'm not sure if it was because of these plants or because of the other plant i purchased (Jardin Plastic Aquarium Fish Tank Grass Plants Ornament D√©cor)Thankfully he's much better after treating.These plants are good looking but please be attentive & careful if purchasing"
2,Not a Green Shipper,Average for a plastic plant. I would never order again because of the huge box it was mailed to filled with plastic air protectors. Extremely wasteful. No green shipper here.
3,"It's Average, does the job","The base is plastic, and the plant is stuck in it with hot glue, so it looks pretty cheap. Since the base goes under crushed rock in my tank it doesn't really bother me. During washing some of the leaves popped off, but you can just put them back on, as they snap onto the ends of the stems. Some of the leave were missing however upon arrival, which was a bit annoying. Overall, it does the job of adding floral accents to the tank, but it's nothing amazing."
1,silk ? Realy ?,This is NOT silk but cheep plastic . It looks cheep and is cheep . sorry I ever bought it as its going in the trash
5,This is a great CD,"Many people in the United States just know the main stars of the music industry. A couple examples are Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, and *Nsync. In Europe, many teenagers get our music after three months after it came out in the U.S. The teenagers in Italy, Switzerland, and France love more variety. They do not always stick to the same music. Prezioso had a wide variety sort of music which may sound strange to us."
3,New Orleans soaking wet,"The best thing about this movie is Liane Balaban. Like her character, she is young fresh and unbowed unlike the other characters in this movie who all seem weary with disappointments. I think this movie is a time capsule of this disjointed internet meet cute time in America where everyone dreams but are too broke to really go anywhere and about how important the visual is as evidenced of the technology that transforms David Arquette so that his behavior and palate means something completely different with a different face. (But David Arquette's character is actually MORE attractive coming from his own face.)"
1,THIS WON'T MAKE YOU HAPPY,"There are bad movies, and there are badder movies. And then there are simply TERRIBLE movies. This is one of them, an indie that can only serve to prove that MOST (not all, now) indies are movies made by intellectuals who think they have something important or 'artsy' to say, but manage to say nothing. This abominable film is one of the worst movies I've ever suffered through. A plot that makes no sense whatsoever with performances that are stifling and unbelievable, and no semblance of coherency at all. David Arquette should start being a stay at home husband for Courteney, and Ally Sheedy needs to retire. As for Clarence Williams III, he should stay in retirement and watch THE MOD SQUAD or something more productive. Nothing saves this awful mess."
2,coach wallet,"The wallet looked very nice, however, when I put all my things in it, the snap would not stay shut. It seems to be ""outlet"" quality not fit for a Coach retail store or department store"
3,"just ok, but kind of not their fault","Received my poster, very nice, lickedy-split. Still waiting for the frame that was part of the deal, first one was damaged. Emailed them twice about status, very nice and responsive CSR's. Even though this was a very low cost item, as consumers, we just want this resolved. Still waiting on the frame about a month after the poster arrived. Again, not their fault and I would buy from them again because of the responsiveness."
5,"I don't speak French, but ...","This has been a very enjoyable CD, even though we don't speak French. Even our adult children enjoyed Pigalle while visiting us. It's fun."
1,Broken out of the box,"Put the pump (brand new out of the box) in a refilled/clean pond with everything perfectly clean. Worked for about an hour before it started stuttering. Sounded like air or something was caught in the impeller, but its perfectly clean, the pump is submerged completely. Pulled off the impeller to see if anything was caught, but it was perfectly clean. The Danner Mfg website is of no help. Also for the 1 hour or so it did work, the output was much less than expected (barely more than my 300gph we were replacing). All in all I'm quite disappointed."
3,Surprised at the lack of power,"added this pump to the pond with a skimmer filter. Not so impressed. It ""says"" its 700gpm but the smaller 500 pump I got at homedepot out performed this on by miles.It might make better for a small filter.It should be rated 300-400gpm by its performance"
1,Pond pump,Have had for less than a year. It quit working totally after about 6 months. We didn't bother looking at it until now since winter was coming and we didn't need it anyway. It already has loose parts and needs either repaired or replaced.
3,Does what it supposed to do,I've owned this pump for over a year now and I am satisifed with its reliability. I would buy another one if I need one.
5,Amazing,This book is amazing. Every time I read this book I can't put it down. Thank you to whoever made this book. I'm sooooooo grateful for it. Thx. <3
4,Good,"It's a good version of some great works by a wonderful author. There are a few mistakes here and there, but I won't complain too much since it was free."
4,Got some of his more popular works in this,"Got some of his more popular works in this volume including Cask of Amontillado, The Pit and the Pendulum. Thoroughly enjoyed re-reading them."
4,2nd book of an good compilation of works,"Since I'm a huge Edgar Allen Poe fan, this book was perfect as part of two others. My only criticism is that I wish all three (?) books could have been combined into one."
4,Great read,"Great book to read, Edgar Allan Poe is a great writer, I would suggest this to anyone who likes to read."
1,this volume for kindle is garbage,"But then again, what do you expect from a free book? every single punctuation mark in the book is replaced with symbols like @ # $ % ^ & * ( ).... Whoever the hell made this version for the kindle needs a good slap in the face."
1,Don't Buy the Kindle Edition!,"The Kindle edition was obviously digitally scanned and MANY characters have been replaced by question marks or blank spaces. It makes the text very difficult to read, especially as Poe liked to pepper his short stories with quotes in Latin, Greek and French. I highly recommend Poe's short stories - it's just this edition that stinks."
5,edgar allan #2,"if you like edgar allan poe at all, they have a 5 volume set that includes almost most of his works. for the kindle they are all free."
4,A classic reformatted for the Kindle - nice job!,Very nicely formatted for the Kindle. Got me back into reading the classic novles I rememberedf rom High school and Junior High.
1,Get out your magnifying glass,Get out your magnifying glass and decoder ring cause you're going to need them to read this book.Actually under sufficient magnification and in the right light it looks like an old typewriter font with a really bad ribbon and then shrunken and shoved together.I am over 50 but I have brand new glasses. My wife is younger and does not ware glasses. She took one look and laughed.The paper stock is unremarkable but the largish format looks like it might be just the right size for a bird cage. It might also be good for starting fires but I have not tested this yet.
3,"Interesting premise, uninteresting book","While I found the basic concept of Young's ""The Bridge"" to be quite interesting, a distant alien race attempting to communicate by sending a message encoded in a virus, I found the story of this attempt to be slow and emotionally unmoving.The characters are generally unsympathetic and didn't evoke any feelings in me other than the hope that they'd just get on with it. They related as badly to each other as they did to me.The destruction of most of humanity, and the residual longing generated within the minds of the survivors of the virus for contact with the senders of the virus message, felt like a shakey foundation for a story that meandered to an equally shakey conclusion.I was not informed, I was not involved, I was not surprised, and I was not particularly happy to have spent the time that I devoted to this book.Not a keeper."
1,It doesn't make sense,"I rarely flame a book, because I know what it takes to put one together. However, The Bridge doesn't make sense for so many reasons. The characters are not real. I cannot imagine a mother committing suicide right after giving birth. It is not realistic to believe food would start flowing back to the cities after a pandemic virus wipes out 4 billion people. And who kept the power grid running during this disaster?Yes, there is a sci-fi premise regarding first contact (sort of), but humanity tends to react a bit differently in the light of megadeath than what was depicted here."
1,Not really SF,"This is more of a popular fiction novel with a science fiction theme than a true science fiction novel. It is hard to explain the difference, but it has to do with the way that the novel sets up the characters and progresses through the plot, and the writing style itself. The idea is a good one, but the presentation left me cold. Maybe I'm just a ""literary SF"" snob, but if you are too, you'll be disappointed in this novel."
2,This CD is so overrated.......,"Alright, it's getting two stars because there's two good songs on it, and that's the ONLY reason it gets two stars. This CD and this band is so over rated it makes me sick. If they would have been around say 20 years ago, they would have fit right in with their 80s hair band sounding drivel. The lyrics aren't bad, there's a few lines that make you go HELL YEAH, but for the most part, BOREDOM sets in around the 4th or 5th track. And only lets up on one or two songs. So I've already let it go to someone else who wanted the CD but couldn't pay for it. I'll stick with my obscure bands that no one has ever heard of. As for this CD, the best thing about it is the cover. SO, goodbye QOTSA, until next time......."
1,the album title says it all...,"After just playing the album through for the first time before writing this review, I realize I haven't given what I just heard much time to sink in, but since first impressions are everything, I'm gonna share mine. This album is boring, it has no emotion, it all sounds the same, and the title was right on the money...""lullabies to paralyze"", because that's all this album will do to/for you...put you to sleep. I don't quite get why a a lot of the american public has a boner for this band, because if this album has anything to say about it, there's some poor tastes in music out there. Have I heard crappier music than this? of course. could I make a better album myself? of course not. but for the hype that surrounds this band, this is unacceptable."
5,"These ""lullabies"" make me stay awake, instead of going to sleep.","I got this CD for my birthday and when I heard it for the first time I really got lost in it. This CD is really awesome and I fell in love with it when I first heard it. I love all of the songs because they are so awesome! Now when I listen to my lullabies I stay awake instead of going to sleep. If you get this CD you will get lost in it and it will make you stay awake instead of going to sleep. Because this CD really rocks and I love it! Oyasuminasai. (That means ""Good night"" in Japanese.) When you listen to this CD... it will make you stay awake... and you can't sleep unless you hear your lullabies every night. Also if you want to stay awake always take your medication. DRINK LOTS OF CAFFEINE!!! That's what I do when I sometimes stay up late. I really love this CD because these are my kind of lullabies and they really rock!!!THANK YOU QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE! YOU REALLY ROCK!!!"
5,A VERY GOOD CD NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED...,"When this cd first came out I was a bit skeptical because i was a huge fan of SONGS FOR THE DEAF and I wasn't sure if they would be able to top it, but I was dead wrong, when I finally started to actually listen to this disc. It reminds me of R which to tell you the truth is my favorite QOTSA cd, but this one is tied as my favorite QOTSA disc. All the songs are well written and produced very well, they are still great live I recently saw them at the vic and was impressed with there show so thats when I decided to give LULLABIES TO PARALYZE another chance and I'm glad I did because it is now up there with R and I can listen to it over and over again without skipping any of the songs. I agree there are filler tracks but not to many which makes this a great cd. So far I'd have to say this is the best of 2k5 but I'm not sure because I'm waiting patiently for the new AUDIOSLAVE and SOAD cd's."
3,"Good, Just Good","I was a big fan of their last cd, Songs For the Deaf. It made a huge impact with songs like Millionaire, No One Knows, and First It Giveth. It was a sensational cd. So I must say that Lullibies to Parylize was somewhat of a disappointment, although I expected a decline after the ""breakup"". The Medication was also a good song, but it was less than 2 minutes long. Some other songs like Tangled Up In Plaid, In My Head, and Skin on Skin were average, but not the best that QOTSA had to offer. It is evident that the loss of Nick Oleveri hurt the individuality of the band. Josh Homme put in a great effort, but it just wasn't the same. I hope that this isn't the end of one of the greatest rock bands of recent history."
4,"This is the good stuff, come on y'all, and take a little bit","For all of the NIN fans who think that ""change is good"", listen to how it's really done. After beginning to listen to ""Lullibies to Paralyze"", the first three tracks had me worried . But it would get better. Much better. If I were to rate tracks 4-13 only, they would easily get 5 stars. Up until ""Songs for the Deaf"", I really did think that Josh Homme, whom I have been a fan of since his beginnings with Kyuss, could do no wrong. I thought that half of ""Songs for the Deaf"" was killer, but there was half filler too. But with his new album, Homme realy does show that he is on top of his game as a songwriter. If you don't like this, you're just not getting it. Your loss. And as I fade away..."
3,Queens of the stone age change,"catchy, orginal, and good. It is definatly hard to follow songs for the deaf and i like the fact where they changed this album. Good tracks are: this lullaby, medication, tangled up in plaid,in my head, little sister, thats a killer scene there. My favorite tracks are: everybody knows that youre insane, Burn the witch, and my absolute favorite someones in the wolf.IT IS A GREAT album but i only gave it 3 stars which it should actully get 4 stars but whatever it is good."
4,"Not their greatest, but still plenty of good stuff","Much has been said of Nick Oliveri's ouster from the group and the reprecussions thereof, but this album reaffirms how unnecessary he is. The opener is a dark, quiet tune with Mark Lanegan providing some of the most haunting vocals I have ever heard. As soon as it has started, it is done, only to initiate the musical carnage. The disc loses momentum halfway through, but closes very well with ""Long, Slow Goodbye"". Even though it's not their best disc, it is well worth picking up."
3,NOT BAD!!,"Some quirky and catchy toons, can see why they don't get the radio play that the rest of those corporate drones get. Sounds like they really make an attempt to create a unique blend of styles, hence less radio play, and believe me people that is a good thing. And this is from one play through, think I will check it out one more time and see if I think it's worth adding to my collection. With all of the crap I have reviewed today this was a breath of fresh air................."
2,Ehhhhh...,"The title definitely fits the album's songs. This album is pretty boring, especially by Kyuss and previous QOTSA standards. There just doesn't seem to be any creativity in any of the songwriting. In most of the songs, it's the same riff or lick over and over. There are practically no bridges, tempo or melody changes in the course of any of the songs. And there is really no edge to most of the songs. They seem to just drone on. Only Medication, Everybody Knows That You're Insane, and Tangled Up In Plaid save this album to some extent. Overall, extremely weak."
3,"Oreo Cd, the middle is much better than the ends","I liked this CD the more I listened to it. The middle section is truly terrific but the beggining and ending tracks leave something to be desired. ""Little Sister"" is certainly the best song on the CD. I also felt something may have been borrowed from another band. ""I never Came"" sounds suspiciously like ""Like a Stone"" from Audioslave [without the high notes]."
1,What a letdown!! Don't waste yer $$,"Big fan of Kyuss. Liked ""Restricted"". LOVED ""Songs""- thought it was brilliance. But this, sorry to say, is a total disappointment. Where's the aggression? The melody? The balls? The hooks? the SONGS?? It's like Homme took all his most repetitive ideas and made a messy, boring joke just to see who was still listening. There's the odd good riff; he's talented, after all. But mostly it's totally flat. I hate it. I'm giving my copy away. Spend your dinero on the new ""Corrosion of Conformity"" instead, it's MUCH, MUCH better music. Peace!"
1,3 decent tracks-11 filler.....BIG DISSAPOINTMENT,"Going by the passed projects from QOTSTA ,I figured it was a safe bet to just go out and buy it.Mistake,I should have reviewed it first on CDNOW.I wish i could return it.I feel this Band peaked with Songs for the Deaf.This is a band with a definative sound and they do not put their best feet forward with these 14 tracks...."
5,Sinister Sound,"This album definitely has a more whimsical sound than that of its predecessors, but this is not a bad thing. Josh and his posse of miscreants have once again pulled together a nice album. Now all he has to do is cut his nasty hair."
4,"A step behind ""songs for the deaf"" but yet quite good","Now QOTSA, is pure Homme, just Homme and nothing but Homme but im certain that QOTSA have been Homme since the genesis of the band and that collaborations from Olivieri and Lanegan and Grohl have just provided interesting elements to the music recorded in previous albums but ""the Queens"" basic element is definitelly Homme and this time ""Lullabies to Paralyze"" is the chance he have to prove that and he have done just fine, maybe not in the amazing way we knew before but fine, very enjoyable cuts we can appreciate here, ""burn the witch"" ,""Everybody Knows That You Are Insane"" and of course ""Little Sister"", it just worths the money spent for this cd, maybe for the next record Homme should recruit the formula included in ""Songs for the deaf"" and the result as we already know will be even betterHM"
4,Great Album,"The interesting thing about this album is the way it jumps around and never seems to get nailed down to one sound. Many tracks bring other bands to mind. Sometimes you feel like you are listening to Radiohead, especially ""I Never Came"" in which Josh seems to almost be doing a Thom Yorke impersonation. Some tracks bring the White Stripes to mind and some even sound like Incubus to me. This is not a critisism, just an observation. A good album."
4,Very Good,"What a great album. Someone's in the Wolf is an incredible song, as are Insane, Little Sister, In My Head, Plaid, and Burn the Witch. The album like mentioned above is a tale of two sides.After songs 2-8 is loses some steam, but those songs in and of itself make for a great album. While it does not hold the firepower of their debut(but not many do) it is superior to both Rated R and Songs for the Deaf.QOTSA are the most gifted hard rock band of today."
4,Lullabies?,"Having been a huge fan of Rated R, and enjoyed Songs, I looked forward to getting my hands on this. It seems to me to be a cd of two halfs, the first half for me ( first 8 tracks ), being the more accessable and contains better songs. To me ,it seems to run out of steam a bit after that, trying to grasp attention with gimmicks (Someone In The Wolf & The Blood Is Love ) and guest appearences ( You Got A Killer Scene..), and relying on the impetus of the first half before ending on a return to song writing with the long slow goodbye. May take non QOTSA fans a few listens to get into."
5,ANOTHER CLASSIC,"The Queens have been on the end of a vicious beating by the precocious media stick as of late. With Nick leaving many people began to doubt their musical output.Well i must say this is not ""Songs for Deaf 2""and it would be plain boring if it was. The hard edge that Nick brought to the queens fold has calmed to a degree, but in its place is a sort of psychadelic experimentation,that is equally tastey and makes for an interesting listen.(songs like ""Someones in the Wolf"" with the bubbley vocals and complex riff)I saw them live recently and the new songs fit in perfect with the classics.Even though i doubt they can top Songs for the Deaf this is an album that doesnt try to match it, it steps to the left side and shows you something new and fresh. Which in these days is rare for a rock band."
4,"Good, not great.","Josh is going it alone now. You can't compare it to ""songs for the deaf."" This cd doesn't blow your doors off right away, but after a couple of listens, it will grow on you. I like the mellow stuff. At least Josh keeps doing something alittle different but still rocks. It's a good listen."
3,I find myself doing strange things with these lullabies,"Something odd happened the other day when I first heard this album. I was in a state of exhilaration, my mouth was literally watering as I hit play. And it stayed that way until about track 10, 'The Blood is Love.' After that, my mind drifted to back to, well, other things. I got bored. Bored with a Queens album? Blasphemy! But it happened. I've never listened to a Queens CD and skipped tracks. I'm doing it on this one though. After listening to everything the Queens have done and comparing it to Lullabies, you can truly appreciate the raw, unbridled, bitchin bass playing Nick Oliveri. You shall be missed my naked dwarf, and so shall your bad ass bass lines and disgusting screech."
1,The deadline...,"Who is Queens Of The Stone age?1 Person?I think this album is the deadline of J. Homme,I hope it...Horrible."
2,they were better when no one knew them!,"if you guys really want to hear the real qotsa i would much rather recommend you listen to ""rated R"" than either songs for the deaf or this one. i even liked them better when josh played in kyuss, but now they are just another washed up MTV band like all the rest!!"
3,A disappointment.,"It's a decent album. There is a noticeable difference in the band since Nick's departure. As previously stated, the rawness is definitely gone, and to me, that's disappointing. I liked the punk rock/chaos aspect of Nick on previous Queens albums. He added to the diversity that has made Queens so successful.Josh and Company still make a good record, it's just not exciting anymore. For instance, the opening track with Mark Lanegan feels less than inspired. That really set the tone for the rest of the album for me. If you own the other albums then you'll probably buy this one too, just be forewarned that the band sounds different, and not necessarily in a progressive or positive way.I guess nothing lasts forever, and that's too bad."
3,Very mediocre compared to previous albums.,"I've been a fan of QotSA for a few years now. They're a very good band that I feel have never gotten the respect they fully deserve. However, I will tell you right now that this album isn't that great. It's not bad, but it's just not nearly as good as their previous albums. It has it's moments, but previous albums have had so much more. If you're really looking to get into this band I suggest that you check out their older releases (Beaver EP and self-titled LP), for I feel QotSA were at their best during this time. Rated-R is also a good album, but Songs for the Deaf (3rd album) is even better. So basically it comes down to this: albums 1 and 3 are amazing; 2nd album is very good; 4th album is simply mediocre in comparison."
2,like a broken record,"a couple of the songs are good, but most are so repetitive that the album on the whole is just boring. these guys need to take a Learning Annex class on writing a bridge or something."
2,The older stuff was better,"The CD is ok. Not great, not horrid.I only enjoyed maybe 4 songs max on this CD, and yes Little Suster was one of those 4. My advice would be to wait until you can get the CD for under 10 bucks, then make your own decision."
3,"As SNL proved...5 stars for two songs, 2 for the rest","If you saw Saturday Night Live with Will Ferral as host in the Spring of 2005, you would have seen Queens of the Stone Age play two songs: ""Little Sister"" (COWBELL by Will Ferral) and then ""In My Head"". I had never heard Queens stuff before and I fell in love with these two songs. Upon recieving Lullabies, I realized that they are the ONLY two songs that I love. Again, I wasn't a fan of the band, and I have checked out their music-pretty decent-but not up to the quality and melodic presence as Sister and Head. They are touring with Nine Inch, so maybe hearing all their stuff live will change my mind."
2,More like a Josh Homme solo album...,"This was bound to happen. After the brilliant ""Songs for the deaf"" they release ""Lullabies to Paralyze"". Why do I say ""they""? There is no ""They"" anymore. There's only Josh Homme with some session-musicians. Songs for the deaf had Nick Olivieri, Mark Lanegan and Dave ""bleepin'"" Grohl! Nick Olivieri's absence takes away their edge, Mark Lanegan only sings the intro, and well the new drummer is NO DAVE GROHL!!!The sound leans toward the Debut album. But it's not as good as the debut album either.I think it could have been a lot better if only Nick had stayed, I mean everyone knew Grohl & Lanegan wouldn't stay permanently. But losing Olivieri? He gave them that edge. Homme is more of a ""tripper"". As we can hear on this album. Still I like the single ""Little Sister"" and there are more catchy tunes here. But it should have been credited as a Josh Homme solo album."
3,"At first I was ""What the $@#%?"" now it's growing on me","Definitely an album you need to work with. Not much is going to reach right out and grab you off the bat. Definitely a ""headphone"" kind of album. You need repeated listens to really grasp a lot of what is going on. There's actually some really neat, dare I say pretty, things going on. But it definitely lacks the chaos and aggression of a Nick O. project. Very simliar to the Rated R album IMO. Some tunes are straight up QOTSA, but some of the songs just don't go anywhere. You're waiting for something to happen and nothing is resolved. For now it's at the bottom of my QOTSA pile. That may change..................."
4,Not for the deaf but something like it.,"I think I have to agree with many of the other reviewers here when I say that this is not the phenomenal album that Songs for the Deaf is. My first disappointment was the lack of Grohl's drumwork on this one. My second disappointment sits in the first few songs. I think they're too punkish, too dependant on a single driving riff. That being said, after that this album lights up and just freakin rocks. There are some really juicy sleazy, good songs on the latter half of this album. I'm also really glad that there are none of those annoying little radio blurb things from Songs for the Deaf. Worth buying."
4,A more mature sound with the new lineup,"80% of the tracks here are excellent. It is immediately apparent that this is not the same QOTSA from the previous 3 albums (especially when you look at the live material from the subsequent tour on Over The Years And Through The Woods). A darker sound with some amount of blues influence. ""Tangled up in Plaid,"" ""Someone's in the Wolf,"" and ""Long Slow Goodbye"" are definite standouts. Highly recommended."
3,Perfectly competent continuation,"3 1/2 starsBeautifully written with less filler, though lacking a certain bite that has driven much of previous releases, this album succeeders brilliantly as a collection of dark rock singles that are catchy enough to engage the most passive listener and complex enough to keep the jaded radio rocker engaged. Homme draws from his seemingly never ending well of creativity and tries to make up for his long running bass player's dismissal with some of his most thoughtful pop melodies to date, which do as result suffer from a lack of connectivity between the band, translating to a glorified solo project. The fact is, whatever Josh Homme is involved in will basically carry his catchy, slowly yet surely progressing ear, and while the latest Queen's album does not compare in spirit with the previous albums, Lullabie is one hell of a (notso)solo gig."
3,Doesn't answer questions,"Mostly, I enjoyed the book; however, it doesn't explain how money is available for meat inspections, pot hole repair, health care for the poor etc. if I simply refrain from buying an expensive car or grill. Unless he is advocating confiscatory taxes, I fail to understand how my saved money becomes money for these purposes, especially considering in his discussion of consumption taxes, he specifically exempts taxes on savings. My college major was not economics, but I do have a decent understanding of the economy but perhaps I'm too conservative in the area of taxation (I am a former IRS employee)to understand how my savings translates into government expenditures for the benefit of all."
5,Excellent,"How many more words must I write to be polite? Seriously, if one is satisfiedstop with the word requirements!"
3,An interesting book,"Certainly interesting and worthwhile, but if you want to read much of the same themes, with a broader biological perspective and without the preachiness and impractical political solutions, I recommend instead Happiness by Daniel Nettles."
1,An Englsh girls review,"Hello, my name is Alexandrea Marie Anna Bunitorisua and i am reviewing ""Monique"". I think that this doll is very ugly. i think that ""Beth"" you should get something else for your mate (friend), because this is just plain ugly and wrong. What are toys trying to teach children these days?!? That it is fine to graduate schools? Girls should stay home and help their mothers until they are four teen, and then they get married and have children at fifteen. These dolls are very bad for young girls because they make it seem like girls can particapate in sports, which they cannot. That is my opinion and i hope you follow by it. its true."
4,Willie Mabon,"Willie Mabon scored big R&B; hits during the 1950's but by 1979 he was pretty much forgotten in America. He was living in France but decided to venture to Chicago to record this album in 1979. It features the pianist on both harmonica and his regular piano backed by an all-star band, Eddie Taylor and Hubert Sumlin on guitars, Aron Burton on bass and Casey Jones on drums. It is somewhat of a ""quickie"" session so it is not totally rock solid music, but it is still a fairly well produced album. Everybody gets a lot of space to solo and Mabon's vocals are terrific throughout. The songs are a mix of new ones, re-cuts of a few of Mabon's old singles, and a few covers.Willie Mabon never got much recognition beyond his chess singles, but this album, while not amazing, proves he still could make good music even in the later parts of his life at a time when blues was very under-recognized."
5,Brings the set to life,"Our son is not yet three, so he has a hard time pushing the trains around the tracks he builds. However, this train enables him to really bring the tracks to life. He loves the train, and sleeps with it every night. In spite of the admittedly rough treatment, it has held up very well. Nice addition to any Thomas or Brio set."
2,Are you Kidding me?,it amazes me that they can make products that simply don't work. This train can't even climb a hill with more than two cars attached. It derails almost instantly as it approaches curves. My son wants it to work so bad that he just squeals with frustration.
2,Not powerful,"This train is very weak: it moves backwards and forwards slowly, is barely able to go up and down low bridges and cannot go over any more substantial bridges at all, can only pull a few trains, etc. The train also is made out of cheap-seeming plastic. This is not the standard I would expect from Brio trains. (In contrast, the battery-powered Percy we purchased is a little work-horse.)"
2,LET'S NOT FLASH TOO MUCH JUDAISM AROUND,"Interestingly, the author is trying to push the US born jewish people in a sort of a JEWISH MAFIA.Let's be modest and treat all other religions and people as equal.Otherwise bad things will happen to us.The world and its people are not stupid to notice how disciminating and radical a lot of the Orthodox Jews have been towards others.There is a difference between Isreali Jews and US born ones like me.I do not feel that I should promote my Jewish brother, just becouse he is Jewish. I would promote the best person for the task. America has given us so much more than Isreal and I believe that we shall be gratefull and supportive of its people.May all religions and people trive and be equal!!!"
2,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!,"Our daughter got one of these for Christmas. She's taken it out twice on pavement and the rear wheel (which is make out of plastic) broke. I regret paying what I did for this one, not because of what the going price is now but because it's a piece of junk.DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!"
1,Cheap,"I bought this for my 43 lb, 6 year old daughter for Christmas. The BACK FENDER, MAIN BODY, HEADLIGHTS and the RIMS are made of CHEAP PLASTIC. This toy was broken on the first day she rode it. The back rim and the back fender cracked and broke making the bike useless."
3,"Broadcast was in HD, DVD resolution is SD","The DVD contains all three of the Final Four games from the 2008 NCAA Basketball championship. However, even though the games were broadcast in 16:9 HD, the DVD resolution is 4:3 SD. So much is packed onto this DVD (Three full games along with all the pre-game broadcasts) that the DVD master had to be severely compressed, so the image is not very good. I would rather have purchased Blu-Ray versions at the original high resolution for my big screen TV."
1,What was Angela thinking?,"I love Angela Thirkell's books--she is one of my favorite authors along with Trollope and Austen. But she wrote a few clinkers, and this is one of them. I would have guessed that Georgette Heyer wrote this book, in a blind test. It has all the cloying archness of the (only) book by Heyer I read and which I forever associate with Regency romances. Of course, this IS a Regency romance--NOT one of her wonderful Barsetshire books, so maybe it was a misguided experiment."
2,Flummery,"Surely, dear reader, this book must be a parody of Austen and Trollope. But one turns the pages with an uneasy consciousness that one has not been let in on the joke."
5,Water filter,Purchased the water filter and installed it per the instructions. I had a pre drilled hole in the granet. Works great. Easy to change the filters. I also signed up for the automated filter delivery. Every 6 months you receive a new one. Great reminder when it's time to change the filter.
3,This book is okay,"You're much better off getting ""Library Of Piano Classics"" parts 1 & 2. I bought those two books first, and after ordering this book I was disappointed because it pretty much has almost all of the same songs (my fault, not the book's fault.) Plus, after going plastic coil binding you can't go back, and this book is lacking in that respect. Also, I found the printing to be somewhat smaller than normal.In summary, yes this book has a lot of the great songs you'll want to play, however do yourself a favor and get ""Library Of Piano Classics"" BOTH parts 1 & 2 instead... they're more user-friendly and you get pretty much the same songs PLUS a ton more."
2,The font is too small.,This book would be so much better if the music was readable. The typeset is too small. The book also needs a spiral binding so that it doesn't close on itself.
4,Great Gift.,"I got this book for my wife who studies music and she liked it, it has a great variety. You might want some clips to keep it open on your music stand however, It would have been nice if it was a spiral bound book. Other than that no complaints, great gift."
5,One of the best!,"One of the best books ever written on the subject of divine healing, by one of the best authors ever! As with all books by A. Murray, the spotlight is on ""sanctification"" of the people of God in this book. Why do you want to be healed? What are you going to do with your healing? Be ready to have the Lord probe into your heart. Recently retitled ""Healing Secrets.""Randy"
5,try it!,"If Andrew Murray wrote it, buy it. You won't be disappointed! From Wikipedia: ""Andrew Murray (1828-1917) was a South African writer, teacher, and Christian pastor. Murray considered missions to be 'the chief end of the church."" I first read ""Experiencing the Holy Spirit"" by Pr. Murray, and since then I've been hooked. Because of when and where his books were written, they are somewhat of a tough read. But if you get one of his books, I doubt you'll be disappointed."
1,easily removable while locked,"This cap seemed good at first. However closer inspection reveals that this will only deter the least determined of gas theives, and is more of a visual deterrent then an actual security device.A close look at the design of my filler neck reveals the nubs on the cap just sit behind the guides on the filler neck. They don't lock in. What this means is that if you pull up on the cap and turn, there is a friction battle between where the spinning top contacts the base of the cap and the nubs against filler neck. Guess which has less friction... the nubs against the filler neck. For this design to work, the cap would need to spin on ball bearings, or something else that has less friction then the nubs against the filler neck.Bottom line: If you pull up on the locked cap with gentle to moderate force and turn the cap, it comes right off. The design of the filler neck plays a role, so this may not be true for all cars, however it is true for my Saturn Ion."
5,Great for detering gas thieves,"I purchased locking gas caps for all the cars in my family (5). Due the the high cost of gas now, we have had neighbors who had gas stolen out of their cars. If a thief tries to steal from any of our cars, it would take more effort than its worth to get to ours. I would suggest buying these because they are a very good cap and a great value."
3,Locking Fuel Cap,"Someone stole my gas cap on my car, so I shopped around for a cap that would be harder to steal. I found the locking fuel caps, and this one seemed to have good reviews, was a reasonable price, and fit my car, so I got it. It works fine so far for the most part (hasn't been stolen if nothing else), but a word to the wise, if you buy this cap, (and possibly others like it), it is really hard to open when you need to put gas in your car. I've spent the last few times looking like an idiot trying to open my own gas tank, taking like 5mins to finally get it open. Least I know no one can steal it again if I can't even open it. Practice with it first, a lot, so you can open it properly. I don't know if it is designed to be hard to open with a key on purpose or not."
2,It could be better,"I wish they had identified the top or bottom of the key slot or they could have used a double sided key, since the key isn't guided into the lock very well it's always a bit of a pain to figure out which end is up.Another thing that would help, would be some kind of retainer, even if it didn't exactly match the original, at least some kind of lanyard attachment so I didn't have to worry about losing my new gas cap.At least the fit and function are close to the original cap, just slightly loose."
5,Great movie for fans of film noir and cinematographer John Alton.,"This is one of the gems of the film noir genre that is often overlooked. The best part of the movie is the incredible cinematography by John Alton. Also the cast, including a supporting role by Van Cleef, the ""good the bad and the ugly"" star who plays the bad in the legendary western. Great addition to anyones film noir collection."
3,Dark crime drama delivers the goods,"Gritty, entertaining story is nevertheless upstaged by excellent cinematography and direction. However, not for those who can't take an unrelenting grim tone. Memorable ending, with a BIT of a ray of sunshine in the final moments. The DVD utilized a pretty good print of the film (no major glitches), but there aren't any extras."
1,DigiComTV is the very best print of The Big Combo (1955) to buy.,"Film Noir Lovers - you can now have a quality print of The Big Combo (1955)!I have purchased three prints of The Big Combo (1955):Studio: Alpha VideoDVD Release Date: October 26, 2004Studio: Geneon [Pioneer]DVD Release Date: October 4, 2005Studio: DigiComTVDVD Release Date: August 12, 2011The DigiComTV print is the very best print of ""The Big Combo (1955) to buy.The DigiComTV print is in fact Digitally Remastered.The DigiComTV print is a clean gorgeous crisp print with excellent sound that will make it possible for you enjoy all of the unique nuances of this Film Noir movie.5 Stars for this great movie - an excellent example of the Film Noir style."
5,NOIR FOR CONNOISSEURS!,"It doesn't get any better than this. The delicious writing and cool, gritty ""look"" of the film is perfect. No one's more male, sexy or gorgeous than Richard Conte at his best, an icon of 1950's style and attitude, in love with a young, blonde femme fatale. But once she (Cornel Wilde's real wife Jean Wallace) finds out that he's married, God help him."
4,Nature's Own with extra pulp,"What a swell cast and fine B pedigree we have here . I've never seen Brian Donlevy play second banana before . Figured his character would be champing at the bit to change that arrangement . Lee Van Cleef and Earl Holliman are a terrific pair of hoods (a frequent for Van Cleef) prior to the European westerns . Richard Conte chews the scenery real fine and is a hoot as Mr. Brown . I hadn't knowingly seen Cornel Wilde before but will remember him going forward . The two , young arm candies (blonde and brunette) were very fetching and mature in their respective roles . They'd have self conscious , college age girls play these womanly parts today . Thank gosh for yesterday . Fun gumshoe/toughs mashup ."
2,Below average crime drama from the mid 50s,"Length:: 4:48 MinsGood photography, but there are so many better crime films from the 50s. Here's a sample...- ""The Asphalt Jungle"" - Directed by John Huston and starring Sterling Hayden- ""No Way Out"" - Richard Widmark and Linda Darnell- ""The Big Heat"" - Fritz Lang directs Glen Ford and Gloria Grahame- ""The Killing"" - Stanley Kubrick directs Sterling Hayden"
3,stupid film noir movie,"If you want to see a real great movie and an excellent example of film noir watch ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""Out of the Past"". Humphrey Bogart and Robert Mitchem are a pleasure to watch...the acting in ""The Big Combo"" is aweful and the story is weak, if I didn't have to write a paper about it for my Film 101 class I never would have bought it."
4,Interesting!,"This monograph was a requirement for one of my graduate seminars. Although I was ""forced"" to read it, I believe this book does offer an interesting perspective. At times, her interpretation seemed to be a bit of a stretch; for example, she ""read into"" a white divider between a photograph of a man and a photograph of a woman- some times a white border is simply a white border, in my opinion. However, for what it is worth, I do recommend this book."
4,Well-written and accessible...,"...the main thing to know before buying it is that it is definitely a product of DTS theologians (Zuck, Fanning, etc.), so it's dispensational, reformed, etc. As long as one knows this, one will get one of the most accessible one-volume theological surveys of the NT on the market. Worth having."
3,"great vendor, lousy music",The CD was sent immediately and was in perfect condition. Too bad I just did not like the music.
3,"Fun toy, lasted 3 days","We ordered the turtle, other cuz, and chicken at the same time. Our dog, a voracious chewer, loves these toys. The rubber is strong and resistant, but allows her to get a real chew feeling. However, Rosie excels at chewing off any appendage on her toys and immediately got the little feet off, then on the third day managed to decapitate the turtle. She likes the remaining ball, but she liked it more when it was a more odd shape. For $5 I'm ok that it didn't last too long, but I'm not likely to order the turtle again."
2,"JW Pet Company Ruffians Turtle Dog Toy, Small (Colors Vary)","JW Pet Company Ruffians Turtle Dog Toy, Small (Colors Vary) , ordered accidentally, thought it was bigger, my 2 labs would swallow this like candy, gave to a friend who has a boxer, too cheap to return for credit/exchange"
2,"Cute, but didn't last long!","When I got this in the mail, it was a very cute little toy and my dog loved to chew on it...for the whole 20 minutes that it lasted. The first thing she did was turn the little tail into a nub, and then she chewed through the neck and actually separated the head from the rest of the body. It was nice while it lasted, but I was expecting a bit more from a toy that is called ""ruffians."" The only toys my dog hasn't been able to kill, although this was very quick by her standards, are the West Paw ones."
5,dog loves these !,"these last for years in my house, they tug, throw, bounce, chew and the sqeekers never give out, they stand up to the weather when left outside"
5,I love these toys,I only buy JW pet toys. I have to aggressive chewers at home that are very hard on toys. It take a long time for them to destroy these.
3,Good beginner's guide to constellations & astronomy,"This is an excellent starter book for stargazers, and fits into your pocket."
5,Chords and Scales for dummies?,"Disclaimer: I am musically challenged, I don't play guitar very well, however, I do know that if you are trying to understand the fundamentals of music,this book is great. The book explains how chords, scales, and keys are related, and gives simple examples of how to use them all properly together. Other books I read on music and music theory seemed to assume a fundamental base of music knowledge that I didn't have, and hence I never really figured it out. This book explains music (specifically scales and their relationship to chords) in a very simple yet elegant fashion. I definitely recommend this one for folks that don't already have a lot of music theory under their belt; hard to beat for the price."
4,"Enjoyable, Quiet time Music.","Couples, very aptly named. Nearly all done in duet. Couples is from the older/former members era. This album has a more hushed, romantic feel but does have a few bits of energy here and there... There are repeats as with most of the older works. In my opinion, this album is something for the collectors rather than the uninitiated, casual listener. Do not misunderstand this review-this album is very good. I believe that the WOW factor is not there for the people who are not yet fans of P5 and particularly, their older works. Also, this album clocks at 38 minutes (but doesn't feel choppy or hurried.) If your just getting into P5's older works, save this one for later rather than first."
4,Have Used This Journal for More Than A Decade,"I love the design and working format of this journal! It keeps me on track by providing a great framework but limits amount of writing to one line for each thought you want to list. This is great for me b/c I normally would write more ""to fill the blank page"" and then become daunted by the daily nature of the gratitude practice. The only reason I put 4 stars is because for the first time in over a decade of using these journals, this year's came without the marker ribbon. It doesn't look like it ever had one. I hope this was a fluke and not a new, cost cutting measure taken by the publisher! Otherwise, l love this book....it helps keep me sane!"
2,"In theory, a good idea...","I foget to write in it, it's prob my own issue, but there is no ongoing reading so I basically read the intro, wrote in it a couple of days and forgot about it..."
2,IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS,The idea behind this journal -- to each day write down 5 things you are grateful for -- is a good one. But this is simply a poorly designed book without enough room allotted to write down one's thoughts. It's just not worth the price. Buy one of the countless -- and less expensive -- journals currently on the market and keep your gratitude log in that.
1,Buyer Beware!,"Oh Please! How does Ms. Ban Breathnach live with herself ---Selling a blank book for $12.95! Keeping a journal is not her newidea, but an age old idea (an an excellent one.) Any book will do to write your journal, and it is easier to write in a composition book or ringed binder than in this stiffly bound book that won't stay open."
1,BLANK BOOK,"THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH GETTING. IT'S JUST A BLANK BOOK [...] YOU CAN WRITE AJOURNAL IN ANY BOOK ESPECIALLY A RINGED NOTEBOOK WHICH IS CHEAPER AND BETTER. YOU CAN STILL TAKE THE ADVICE (NOT ORIGINALLY HERS, WRITING JOURNAL AND WRITING 5 THINGS YOU ARE GREATFUL FOR) JUST DON'T WRITE IT IN THE BOOK THEY SELL YOU BECAUSE THEY HARDLY GIVE YOU ANY SPACE."
3,Disappointed,"I buy this journal every year and this year I bought one for my niece as well. However, when I went to use mine, the page saver ribbon was not attached."
1,not enough writing space,"I bought this journal along with Simple Abundance: A Daybook of Comfort and Joy. The cover is nice (hard) and there is a string to mark your place. There is also a large list in the front of often overlooked things to be thankful for on the days that you're having trouble coming up with something. However, I was unable to actually use the journal for the simple fact that there is not enough space to write! Each day only provides 5 lines and the lines were not enough for me to write a complete sentence across, even writing small. I didn't want to limit my ability for expression each day, so I bought another gratitude journal that provides an entire page for each day. You could really use any blank journal also, as the journal itself doesn't have prompts or any necessary information."
5,My personal gratitude diary to God.,I love this book! It is very useful in allowing me to express my gratitude on a daily bases. The author shares inspiring words on almost every other page. Not to mention the numerous things she reminds use to be thankful for. It's my favorite book after the Bible.
3,Great for beginners but serious journalers need more lines!,"I simply love Sarah Ban Breathnach's Simple Abundance. And yes, the gratitude journal is a life changing experience. I would recommend it for anyone. This book is also nice if you can sum up your daily gratitude in a few words. I have a few friends who feel 5 lines for 5 daily seeds of gratitude is sufficient.However, if you are like me and enjoy journaling. If your 5 items that you are grateful for turns in to 7, 10, even 20 items each day (believe me, once you get into the habit of the gratitude journal, you will become grateful for everything) -- then you need to purchase another journal. I would recommend buying this book for the inspiration, but buy a beautiful blank journal later as your gratitude grows!"
2,"Excellent Adventure, but way Bogus Journey","This movie was nowhere near the original, so should you wish to watch it, don't expect to be in stitches the whole time. I honestly like it less and less each time I watch it, which to me is a mark of a bad movie. It does have it's moments, hence the 2 stars (it is after all Bill and Ted, it HAS to have moments!). My suggestion is rent/borrow it before purchasing it. If you love it--buy it. If not--don't."
4,William & Theodore,"Bill and Ted are the rock stars of the future. When the evil De Nomolos creates evil robot ""us""es, Bill and Ted die and must beat Death at games like ""Battle Ship."" They must travel al around the after-life to find ways to save the future and their girlfriends."
2,"Bogus, package labeled correctly","Whole family loved the first when viewed in 2011, it is aging well. This one is not aging well too many things are too bogus to keep the story line going.The scene with the Reaper's Challenge is the only redeeming scene and even that one is slower than most scenes in today's comedies. Only watch if you are a ""Bill and Ted"" Historian."
3,"Great sequel, mediocre transfer","Saw ""Bogus Journey"" for the first time over the weekend and it literally blew my and a handful of online friends' heads. Clever, funny, well-acted and fully aware of its premise and sense of humor. The rare sequel that improves and is way better than its predecessor? Yes way! Shame the transfer on amazon is just a quick-and-dirty SD port of the DVD content, which frankly looks like ass on the computer or an HDTV with a smart app (which is how I saw it). The movie is the star so don't let the technical shortcomings keep you from seeing it, jet set your expectations accordingly."
3,Not the same magic.,"Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is a good sequel to ...Excellent Adventure but I was hoping for so much more. Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, and George Carlin reprise their role and I do like the Seventh Seal send-up of this film, the grim reaper is the best part of the film. Reeves sure makes the audience believe he is that shallow, bravo! Check this hidden treasure out sometime!"
1,WELL AT LEAST THIS TIME THEY GOT THE TITLE RIGHT!,"After watching the abysmal ""Excellent Adventure"" I took another kick in the nads and watched this complete waste of time. If you think the first film is bad, then don't even think about this one. Once again our two uncharismatic do-do birds go on another ""trip""! Whoopee! :-D I do want to point out that I like stupid stoner films and I can watch the dumbest of dumb when it come to them, but this film is boring, stupid and should have nothing of interest for anyone. There are so many better stoner comedies out there! Lets just forget this one ever happened!"
4,Wild Stallyns Rules! Did I Spell That Right?,"As good as the first Bill and Ted film was and still is (""Excellent Adventure""), this sequel raised the bar. Hilarious at every turn, and it deals with life and death issues at the same time. Throw in Bill Sadler (the great character actor from ""Die Hard 2"") as the reaper, appearances by Pam Grier and George Carlin, a parody of Ingmar Bergman's ""Seventh Seal"", and you've got a movie that probably oughta rate 5 stars. Despite the heady subject matter, the most important plot thread is whether the boys will win the ""Battle of the Bands"" contest. Station! (PS-this and the first film would make an excellent double-feature DVD)"
4,"Not as good as original, but MOST triumphant!","How it going, dudes? Bill & Ted, leaders of Wyld Stallyns, from the great 1989 comedy, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, are back in this 1991 sequel! Like their most excellent friend, Rufus, told you, they do get better. But a totally evil dude from the future, De Nomolos, has sent two bad robots back in time to kill Bill & Ted, so he can rule the world, which will make it a terrible place. Bogus! They do, and in order to come back to life and save the world, Bill & Ted must beat the Grim Reaper in a game. Can they do it?This film has both Keanu Reeves (Ted) and Alex Winter (Bill) returning, and George Carlin returning as Rufus to help them out again! This movie is not as good as the first one, but it is still a MOST triumphant film!! You gotta see it, too!! So, again, ""Be excellent to each other"", and ""Party on, Dudes!"""
3,My Daughter loved it,The movie was in good condition and my daughter loved it. I think she watched it three times in two days
5,wow,"I loved this movie and the one before it. I laughed so hard, I thought I'd explode. The Bill and Ted adventures are by far the best movies I have ever seen. We even named our four neubian goats these names: Bill, Ted, Evil Bill, and Evil Ted. Love the movies!"
4,Same but different as the first one,"More of the same humor, as Bill and Ted are now DEAD and have to fight it out with the Grim Reaper to get back their lives so they can go home and be with their girls. Still funny, still nothing spectacular. A very good match with their ""most excellent adventure"", but again, not a real classic. It won't let you down as long as you aren't expecting a movie that redefines comedy. Want a good laugh? This will not let you down."
3,Ever buy a CD just for one song?,"There is exactly one reason to purchase this CD, and it's Porn Orchard's ""This Holiday Season"", a track that's been circulating on the internet as ""Christmas Sucks"", attributed to Tom Waits and Peter Murphy. In fact, it's a spoof (neither artist was involved or informed), and you can hear the full-quality original version here, including an extended spoken intro that a lot of the mp3 versions leave off (and that makes the fact it's a joke a little more clear).Everything else on here is honestly mediocre to barely-listenable. The title works as a pretty good guide to managing your expectations - these songs may be better than a poke in the eye, but not by a whole heck of a lot."
3,Tourist video,"I've been to Kanha, else this video wouldn't have particularly interested me: but as a souvenir, it's fine.Could do with more of a ""storyline"" (e.g. Lions & Hyenas, Mortal enemies) but as a ""general"" film of tigers it's ok."
4,Still sounds great,"I can't believe I'm the first to review this. After not playing this disc for years I dusted this off the other day, listened to it, and was ashamed at myself for letting it get dusty. Man this cooks. I know Jackie McLean is a sax legend and has countless releases, but this is the only one I've heard by him. This 59-minute treat is a tasty bop tinged feast played by a seven-piece lineup (trumpet, trombone, sax, vibes, piano, bass and drums). All eight songs are original compositions, three are ballads and one has a brief vocal passage. A very enthusiastic exciting disc, and for less than five bucks used, this is a no-brainer purchase if you like jazz."
5,1s Round Draft Picks is the s***!,I've played this album EVERYDAY since I've had it. I just wish more people knew about this album and Swishahouse in general. I was out of town and people kept asking me what I playing. I haven't heard an album as hot as 1st Round Draft Picks in a while.
1,That Boy Mike Jones Is A Fake Man,That boy mike jones is about to get what is coming to him. He running around houston claiming he the king of the streets boy please. If anyone want to hear some real underground rap from houston go get that Chamillionaire (The MixTape Messiah) cause that is a true mc that should be out there cus Dike Jones -Who- Dike Jones his album is never coming soon. He has been saying that it is coming soon since 2002 but all he has done is put out two trash cds before he would even put out the cd he been talking about for two years. now he about to put out a cd with Paul Wall Called -The Future- but where in the hell is His Solo album. Oh Yeah it coming soon since 2002. Paul Wall messed when he turned his back on Chamillionaire but That Mixtape Messiah pt.2 expose this fraud ni--as. So go get that Chamillionaire The Mixtape Messiah. SO you can remember what real underground music is. Hiram Clarke Tx.
5,The Baptist Identity: Four Fragile Freedoms,Very Good and Very informative. I highly recommend the reading of this book because we tend to take for granted the freedoms that allows us to stand and proclaim God's Holy word to the world. Upon reading this book we will realize how fragile our freedoms are becoming in bringing the word of God to a dying world.
3,M.I.S.,"This textbook isn't too bad, albeit starts out as if you know nothing about information technology.The modules and quizes are easily mastered, and the book is written fairly well.What more can I say about a textbook!!"
4,Management Information Systems,This book is easy to read and understand.The Opening case at the beginning of each chapter deals with companies we are all familiar with which makes it interesting to read.
3,Textbook Ok,This textbook I got for college cause it was for a class I took. The textbook is ok. It is easy to understand and if you take the right professor for this class you will understand the context for the textbook.
5,Great textbook,"I bought it for my IS class and it turned out quite easy to read with a light tone. Concepts are explained clearly and case studies are very useful. In fact, most case studies were surprisingly interesting to read and informative at the same time. I really enjoyed browsing through the case studies. It really is written with the information-age student in mind. Great read overall, I'm glad my class used this textbook."
5,Excelente producto para su precio,"Mi DCR-DVD205 entra perfectamente, junto a 2 DVD en su respectivo case, el cable AC power entra con mucha dificultad, la correa de la maleta es un poco grande. Bateria perfecta."
1,battery missing!!!!!!,The main reason I ordered this kit was for the battery. When I received it ....NO BATTERY included. I contacted Amazon and all they could do was give me a number for Sony customer service. Thanks Amazon!!!
3,Wonderful for storage!,"I have theSony DCR-DVD105 DVD Handycam Camcorder with 20x Optical Zoom. The camera is light, easy to use, and a great camera. This bag handily stores the camera and at least an extra battery. A few discs (without cases) are able to fit as well. Which, in my opinion, is a strong drawback. If there was more, or even slightly bigger pockets on the side or under the hood of the bag, it would be a lot better and easier to keep things at your finger tips. Maybe some slots for the unused discs on the inside (like a visor CD holder for your car)But for the basic keeping of the video camera hand and within easy reach and protection, which is all you really need, this bag is wonderful."
2,smaller than expected,"I was tempted to buy this product because of the reduced price, but was disappointed that the case barely holds the DVD recorder and little else. It is fine for carrying the recorder when out and about, but as far as carrying extra discs or charger, forget it."
1,where is my NP-FP50,"See the product features, say have a NP-FP50 in it. but I can not find it in the package when i got it today.Product FeaturesIncludes carrying case with built-in accessory pocket and 3-pack of Sony 8cm DVD-R mediaNP-FP50 InfoLithium P Series rechargeable battery pack provides long lasting powerThree DVD-R discs lets you begin recording immediatelyDesigned for DCR-DVD 203, 403, 105, 205, 305, 405 and 505 camcorders"
5,Sony Accessory Kit,"Sony ACCDVDP2 Accessory Kit for DCR-DVD 203, 403, 105, 205, 305, 405 & 505 Camcorders. This Sony Accessory Kit is made with quality and is beautiful! Very, very nice! If you receive this, you will be very happy with the quality! GREAT for the price!"
1,Way Too Small For Anything but the Camera,"If you bought a camera and you want somewhere to keep all your ""stuff"" - nothing outrageous but things like cords, a couple of CDs, maybe a wireless mic, this is NOT your bag. It will carry only your camera. No extra stuff. Buy this to carry your ""stuff"" and you will still be relegated to carrying the rest of your items around in a plastic grocery sack."
4,Beginners luck,"This book ia a compilation of four sumi-e instructional series; Sumi-e in Three weeks, Floral Sumi-e in three weeks, Animal Sumi-e in three weeks, and Landscape Sumi-e in three weeks. The artist welcmes you to the world of Zen art by detailing the history and the influences of the traditions of the far east. Each section has details in ""how to"" for the beginner as the author walks you through each phase of learning the fine art of sumi-e. All of the instructional illustrations are progressive with details on each step and the final completed picture on the same page. Included in this book are some of the worlds most beautiful examples of the art of sumi-e. I have enjoyed the presentation of the author and give this book a high recomendation."
3,Bucket Fishing Hat,"Good quality, fast shipping. One note, if you are looking for the XL portion of the L-XL sizing, you may find it a bit small."
2,Poor explanations for answers.,I found that the explanations given for the answers are unsatisfactory. On the tougher problems (Bin 3) too many of the explantions were to plug in the choices given and see if they work. Some explanations were unecessarily complicated.The good news is that the CD rom works in this edition but the drawback is that the CD rom has no explantions for answers.
3,Good Overall but CD test questions repeated...,"The review provided by this book and CD are adequate, but notoutstanding. A lot of time is spent teaching test-taking tricks,which is time and paper that could have been better spent withadditional examples.I studied on and off from this book for about 4 days, and completed 2 test sub-sections and 2 other complete tests from the CD that comes with the book. On each of the complete tests, my score was exactly the same -- 730. I just sat for the actual GMAT exam this morning and scored a 660. I took the GMAT (paper version) a little over 5 years ago (and about 1 yr out of undergrad) and scored a 690 with little more than a day or two preparation.Did this prep material really do anything for me? You make the call."
5,always fantastic,"Mynta is a Swedish-Indian group formed in 1979. There are 6 band members on this recording. Lots of percussion, flutes, santoor, and vocables; some sax, some guitar, and more. Mostly acoustic instruments, just a faint touch of keyboard for atmosphere and electric bass. Strongly rhythmic but this is not remixed club music, this is a fine and original mix of elements from jazz and India.Some of it is fiery music with a very strong Indian flavour, kind of like Shakti, though with a melodic ""head"" like a jazz piece. One or two pieces could be called ""contemporary easy jazz,"" most of the 11 songs push the edge more than that. They show superb musicianship, and good compositional skills, throughout the recording."
1,Hard to know what to say about this album ............,"I bought this and found nothing of interest. But in saying that, it might just be me. The Indian/Jazz flavor is fairly unrelenting, whereas western melodic influences have sneaked through on their other albums. I like Indian, and I like Jazz, but for some reason Indian Jazz just doesn't do it."
1,not the same one!,It is not the same one as in the picture so dont be fooled. Was excited only to be so disappointed. It seems like it has a different formulation and it definitely has a different packaging so we ended up wasting our money..
1,Not worth the money,"This product doesn't refine facial lines; instead, it dries my skin. Don't like it; wouldn't buy it again. But, see what other reviewers have to say."
4,impressed,I liked this product! The only drawback is that the bottle is small and probably won't last too long.
2,Did not live up to expectations,"Getting the book, I thought it 'would change my life' through all the insight Sennett would bestow on me. Sadly not the case, it was a lackluster title. I don't really have any suggestions as to what might be better."
5,Informative,"Excellent book. P.W. Singer really enlightens the reader about a very alarming and shocking trend in modern military tactics in the world today. This is an issue that most Western people would be horrified by, but are not because it is an issue that is largely unknown. He really shows the reader how this is a global trend in war zones in many continents, not just Africa. He also shows the history of this trend. Good read."
5,The Ultimate Child Abuse,"This book talks about the active recruitment of children in many areas of the world today. He covers how they are recruited, abducted or conscripted, trained and finally set off to fight in whatever hot spot is active at the moment.The one surprising thing about this book is that it treats this as a new problem. War has always been a young persons game. To read the biographies of woldiers of World War II, a surprising number lied about their age to join the army at fifteen or sixteen years of age. In the American Civil War around 100,000 soldiers were fifteen or younger. A surprising, but unknown number were under ten. The pictures of the end of the Third Reich show young boys greeting Hitler. The first American killed in Afghanistan was shot by a 14 year old sniper.On the other hand, by bringing attention to the fact that our Army will have to face children in the battlefield Dr. Singer may help prepare our forces and our public for the real world."
4,"Great collection of short stories, the title is incorrect","Ambrose Bierce was a fine writer and this is a good sampling of his short stories. It is not, however, a complete collection of his short stories. I particularly missed ""One Summer Night"" and there are a number of other stories that could have been been included. Still, this collection is well worth reading."
1,Long and allegorical,Too long.May sound good if you don't know your Bible or Biblical History.The world won't end on 2011 either.
4,online friends beware!,"This book is about a boy named Sam who plays chess on the internet as part of a school project. He has a friend named Vlad who lives in Romanina. Sam's brother and cousin think that Vlad is a vampire. Vlad likes to stay up late and dislikes garlic. Could he really be a vampire? Find out with Sam when Vlad comes to the United States to play in a chess tournament!With simple vocabulary, even the lowest reader can read and enjoy this book.I recommend this book to any student who enjoys or wants to start reading mystery books."
4,Not Inconspicuous,"They are great to wear at home either at night or on weekends. They do not form with the breast and make your breast look weird when worn.ALTERNATIVE USE:I use them when pumping. When I pump one breast at a time, I put the shell to the breast that is not being pumped. Since it leaks, I collect the milk and don't waste it at all!"
3,Functional but leaky!,"As far as providing relief to sore nipples and keeping flat nipples everted, I give it 5 stars. When it comes to the functionality though, I give it 3. I guess they do exactly what they are supposed to--prevent engorgement. But what you end up with is milk evrywhere, no matter which ring you are using. When you try to remove them, no matter how careful you are, milk spills out the vent holes and gets everywhere. I'm not knocking Medela overall, though. Love the company and their products overall. The Harmony hand pump is awesome!"
2,Advice on sound quality - Japan release,"As many have said the remastering done on this version lacks bass and medium. Although this is the most complete best of of the group on two cds, if you want the best songs AND the best sound quality, I recommend you the Japan-only 2009 best of called ""Fantasy"":http://www.amazon.com/Fantasy-Perfect-Best-Earth-Wind-Fire/dp/B001O7713W/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s;=music&qid;=1273528510&sr;=1-5It is relatively cheap for a Japanese release and the sound is much better than ""The Essential"" release. It is probably the best sounding best of of the group currently on the market.For those interested, the Blu-spec Japanese release of ""The Essential"" does not add anything to the sound quality (blu-spec being a technology on the format of the CD, not on the sound)."
1,Good songs but what about the sound quality?,"After several years of waiting, Sony finally put out a great selection of EW&F songs in one package while utilizing a 24 Bit Mastering system. That's Good, but judging from the sound quality it was clear to me that the original master tapes were NOT used! They were so close to getting it right and they blew it! I have no choice but to give this inadequate sounding album 1 star!"
5,CD,Great collection....it has all their great songs and some that I've never heard.....love it!!! Great price and super fast shipping.....Awesome....you won't be disappointed.....smoooth transaction.
5,One Of The Best Greatest-Hits Collection Ever,"If you love EWF, you'll love this. It's got all the hits - ""September,"" ""Shining Star,"" you name it. It's got many songs from ""I Am,"" one of the best albums ever made, period. The only songs I wish were on there are ""Let Your Feelings Show"" from ""I Am,"" and ""Lady Sun,"" from the ""Raise"" album. Don't know why they didn't release that one, because it makes you MOVE! This set also has ""You,"" which I'd never heard before, and it's gorgeous. This CD set will have you rockin'!"
3,"Excellent characters, great story........","This is a very enjoyable western. McKeag is a wonderful 'hero' who loves his wife and his ranch and will not sell out to his threating neihgbor, Bert Praeger. The dialogue is excellent and it's very intense when Dan McKeag's wife and hands are killed and his ranch burned down........and he's shot and left for dead. Fortunately he's taken in and hidden until he recovers somewhat and the rest of the book is dan's revengful search for the 7 murderers and his attempt to get his ranch back from praeger who claimed it as his. His sidekick in the search,Paddy, is none other than his wife's brother who hasn't spoken to him since dan married his sister without his consent. Much action and graphic violence. For those looking for a love story, this isn't it. Not one love scene to be found. As a devout fan and reader of Mr. Martin's wife Kat Martin, I also saw her hand in some of the character development. Too bad he didn't let her add some romance..............."
3,Iron Maze - Who?,"The time - the late 80s.The place - a Pennsylvania steel town in the grips of a recession.Against this less-than-pleasant backdrop is set a story of jealousy and violence. Who did what to who? Why did who do what to who? Who is telling the truth about what who did what to who and why who did what to who?Although this movie should have been good, it comes across as mediocre. The acting is so-so, some sections of the movie seem to wander, it leaves you with the feeling that it should have been better.Ah well, that's show business!!!"
3,Superb Musicianship Ruined,"The musicians performing here are among the best jazz/classical musicians in the world. The performance is world class as you would expect. I love Peacock's moody compositions on this CD rather than the standards this group usually performs. However, all the beauty of this fine jazz is ruined by Jarrett's damn squealing and squawking. On this CD he's particularly obnoxious which is a shame since the material and performance is among the best this group has ever done. It's gotten to the point where I now avoid buying any music with Jarrett. Someone should clue Jarret in.......he's NOT being cute."
2,Agree,"I agree with other reviewers regarding Jarrett. His noises are irritating and distracting not unlike in his own 1970s live solo effort, ""Koln Concert"". The sound engineers at ECM need to seriously considering editing these grunts and groans when remastering these discs."
3,Would be great if not for Jarrett's irritating noises,"I don't know what you're supposed to call the horrible noises that come out of Jarrett's mouth as he plays. It's not singing, it's not scatting or humming or whistling. Whatever it is, it's off-key, shrill and to me, completely distracting on this particular album. Which is very sad because the music here is superb. Really gorgeous and inspired playing by a group of musicians who are completely in each other's minds.I'd give this 5 stars if they could find some way to erase Jarrett's bleatings..but as long as they're so audible, I can't give this more than 3 and a half stars."
4,Nice supplement to study Meisner work.,Nice explanations as to why you learn the words in the way that you do and all books in this series include notebook client pages for you to take notes or practice the exercises. I liked the fact that he included questions of the class and his answers to those questions.
5,Larry's books are excellent for all levels of actors.,"I have personally worked with Larry Silverberg, and before that used his books both to learn and teach the Meisner Technique. I have an MFA in Acting, work professionally as an actress, and teach acting as well, and I have tried many approaches to acting, only to keep coming back to Larry's workbooks. These books are clear, succinct, and incredibly easy to work with, and they include many examples for clarification. Larry is the most nurturing acting teacher, and I cannot recommend him highly enough."
5,"Funny, usable, binky~!","Great novelty item - with a real pacifier for the baby's mouth. Great baby gift that you can be assured, will not be a duplicate."
2,made in china,just kinda scared cuz it had chinese and a made in china all over it. Would the FDA let us buy a tainted product for our kids?
3,Loose in envelope,"Expected it to come in a manufactuer package, but it came loose in a padded envelope from China. Kind of suprised me."
1,used billy bob teeth,very upset used pacifier!!! product came out of package with appearance of being very used realy !!! this was to be given as a gift but is clearly trash but it came in a timely manner
4,Silly!,I don't use these as my everyday binkies....but thought they were hilarious! I pull these out when I need a good laugh at my twins looking even more adorable than usual.
1,Yuck,These are directly from China- really. Shipped in a brown envelope no pacifier case no wrapping. Like who would ever put this near a baby? What a sick waste.
5,Cute as!!,This dummy is hilarious. I bought it as a joke for a friend and I'm sure it will be well received. Hope she uses it on the baby becaise it will look hilarious!!
2,Sad..,"my niece absolutely hates this thing. She hates the taste of it and she gagged the first 2 times I tried to give it to her, so I just gave up. What a waste....."
3,Cute/OK,"I bought this because it was a great price and I thought it was a cute gag and perfect for Halloween. It came quickly, which was great. The issue I have is the nipple is HUGE and would only work for a much older baby. My baby is going on 6 months and is normal for her size. She can't suck on it, it is so big so we can't use it. But it's cheap and cute, I just wish they'd be more descriptive on the size."
5,Great Product and Quick Shipping!,When the product was recieved it was packaged well and all portions of packaging was intact. The product seems to be of great quality and is durable. I intend to buy another variety of billy bob baby pacifiers in the future as my daughter loves hers! Thanks for the awesome product and quick shipping as well!
5,funny as all get out!!!!,i get laughs in church and at the store with this in my kids mouth. It is actually his favorite binky!
5,The inaugural event of the French Nouvelle Vague,"Godard anointed it ""Faulkner meets Stravinsky"". That should be enough of an evaluation. But if you insist...Hiroshima Mon Amour is equally beautiful and baffling. The challenge of the film is its narrative structure, which fluidly blends past and present through bursts of flashback. You might say that the form of the film is a cinematic attempt at capturing the mechanism of memory at work (who can really know if it was a successful attempt, memory is a subjective experience).Marguerite Duras' screenplay is chillingly spare, but a subtle beauty, Sacha Vierny's cinematography, with all its graceful tracking shots is the work of a master, and Emanuelle Riva and Eiji Okada, the handsomely paired couple at the center are played with tenderness and sympathy, and eventually a bitter edge. Alain Resnais pulls them all together for a film that is something of a revolution."
5,Remembrance of things past,"This is a film about memory, like many of Resnais's films. For me, too, it was one of those milestones that changed the way I look at movies and perhaps altered my view of the world--back when I first saw it in the 1970s. Seeing it now, my admiration is maintained, even if the anti-war message seems a little heavy-handed today. Still, it was this film that prompted me to visit Hiroshima when I had the chance, an experience that oddly enough parallels the movie. Seeing bustling, rebuilt Hiroshima with the knowledge of what happened there--aided by the skeleton of the lone bombed-out building that remains--makes one ponder the ""idea"" of memory, the need to remember and the need to move on. Anyway... this remains an excellent movie and one long overdue for a major restoration and release on DVD!"
3,WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION?,"HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR (Criterion) is a love affair between a French actress and a Japanese architect that's set against memories of Hiroshima's atomic aftermath. But more than anything, Alan Resnais' first feature is a visual tone poem to life, love and death. Long acknowledged as a foundation stone of French cinema, this film continues to gather gravitas by scholars, critics and others who define and dwell within film culture. From the perspective of the 21st Century, this emotionally heavy story is sometimes pretentious -- mainly because we have become inured to the raw aftershock of Hiroshima and have little fresh experience of just how devastating a real weapon of mass destruction actually is. Underlying Resnais' film is our profound human need to understand the flow of history; that is, our true identity in time and space. Originally released in 1959, this painful love story still has the power stimulate reflection and emotion."
1,i love japanese genecide,"some french felluh made this film about a script written by some lady of french inclinations. it was made with people talking and followed them on set and in sichue. some people like it.some people don't. see it and see for yourself. as bob dylan said: "" that's the way the cookie monster..."""
5,Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959),"I wanted to see it because the new movie, Amour, stars Emmanuelle Riva as an old woman. As a young woman, she had the lead in Hiroshima Mon Amour, that is really a conversation between Riva and her Japanese lover. An excellent movie."
4,Nice one Neil,"Probably one of the finest examples of perfect popular music around. Quirky lyrics, outstanding orchestral pieces. Buy it. Oh go on you know you want to......"
3,Punk Rock?,"Juxtapose this with ""Elva"" and you nearly have two different bands. ""Here's to the Mourning"" takes a step away from ""up all night"" and a step toward ""seeing red"". This album is ""Unwritten Law gone So-Cal pop."" On the bright side there are some catchy tunes and a couple of decent but pop-y party songs. On the down side it is not what you'd expect after listening to ""Elva"""
2,What happened to UL?,"Well, I really wanted to like thier latest albulm. I listened to Here's to the Mourning several times and could never get into it. Other than Save Me and The Celebration Song, the rest of the albulm fell flat. I am all for change and everything, but compaired to all of thier other cd's this one was scary. I don't know what type of genre they are trying to become, but the hard rock vibe does not work well with Scott Russo's voice. I don't know what I expected, but this was not it. As I listen to all genres of music, I feel dissapointed. What happened UL?"
3,Alright...,"I've always been a ""meh"" fan of Unwritten Law. They've had their songs... not really their cd's though. But I have to say, this one is probably their best out of the others. Give it a try, but don't be prepared to be blown away or anything.Check out UNDEROATH's newest album... Hellzz yeah."
2,Hmmm...,"Unwritten Law has gone slightly downhill. On Elva, we saw some good old fashioned punk-rock laced with some slightly harder content. Also, it had some pretty good lyrics. I picked up 'Here's to the Mourning' expecting it to be more of the same, if not slightly harder. What I got was dumbed down, ""why can't I be on the radio?"" modern rock. For example, the lyrics are just inane, making no sense, merely trying to rhyme wherever it seems like it needs to. You'll hear nothing really new here, just some tired riffs and progressions that you've doubtless heard before in other places.On the plus side, this IS Unwritten Law, and some of the songs are undeniably catchy and good to bounce your head to. I just think that this band is capable of much better music. This one's a miss, but I sure hope that their next album shows recovery."
1,This album straight sucks,"I want my money back. After Elva and Music in High Places, I expected more, not just some really intelligent band trying to be hard... badly."
5,Adorable!,"""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"" is such a classic. Although I've heard some of the famous lines from this charming story, I never read it through. The illustrations are darling. This sweet little poem will get you in the holiday spirit. I recommend."
1,wrong item sent/can't get a response,I bought the arm band but they sent me the waist band and I can't get a response from them.
1,MGM Persona,"depressing...truely depressingWorthy of MGMs demise the wretched DVD of a great film, I have waited years for.(if this is the only way you can watch the film, by all means. If not, by the UK version until Criterion obtains rights for the unavoidable rerelease..)"
2,ratio/aspect,"persona was release 1.37:1, and mgm are releasing it as 1.66:1. if they're redoing hour of the wolf and shame for those mistakes, why are'nt they redoing persona? anyone? where could i find an answer for this one? thanks."
1,Warning - DVD has cropped image,"Persona was made with a standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1, but the MGM DVD apparently has cropped the top and bottom of the film in order to create a fake widescreen image of 1.66:1. See [...] and [...] for details and a comparison of the correct, full frames with the cropped versions on the MGM DVD."
1,Not the edition you'll want,"Can a studio present a movie any way they please after they've bought the rights for it? Apparently so. I saw Bergman's masterpiece Persona at the movies a very long time ago. Over the decades I have remembered it as shocking and terrifying, yet appealing and beautiful. I got excited when I learned of its released on DVD. Now I've watched MGM's life-less and cropped presentation of it, and associate the movie with dullness and disappointment. Bergman is a master who MGM do not respect. Tartan's release (region 0!!) of the film is supposed to be much better, but with less extras (doesn't matter to me, I just want the movie). I'm waiting for my copy to arrive :)"
2,Detached monstrosity of a film. In a word: boring!,"I fell asleep four times trying to watch this enigmatic masterpiece. The only thing that could have wrapped this mess up would have been a car crash killing the two leads. Instead, at the end, what we get is this flash of a movie crew to further frustrate the totally disinterested and removed viewer. What was that all about? I would have rewound the tape, but was tired and ready for this project to come to an end. How can so many people like this?! What about a story for crying out loud?! The most interesting scene is when Bibi Andersson freaks out and repeatedly slaps Liv Ullman in the face. It's kind of over-the-top--something you'd see in a Saturday Night Live skit. And please, no comments about how I'm missing the meaning, the poetry, the depth. First spark my interest, move me in some way, and then we'll discuss depth. In a word, BORING."
3,Impenetrable and dull,"The Bottom Line:Persona feels more like a pet project of Bergman's than a film meant for mass consumption: it's consistently obtuse, mostly dull, and feels long even at under 90 minutes; unless you're a real Bergman aficionado then stay away from this very unpleasant film.2.5/4"
5,A way to understand the language of film.,"As a college film instructor, I find Persona a wonderful text for students to begin to understand the ways film language operates. With it, the critical viewer can surpass content-based approaches to film and begin to understand the way film communicates visually. Not only do I find the film valuable for my students, but myself as well. I love to watch it and unravel its complex and compelling messages. In approaching such a bold and innovative work, I find much of what I love in movies. That experience is beautiful. Persona is one of the few films which can do that for me as well as it does."
5,Ingmar Bergman's Masterpiece: One of the Ten Best Films Ever Made,"In 1966, after a hallucination in a hospital room, legendary Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman got the idea for ""Persona,"" a film about personality, humanity and the doubtfullness of general existence. This is Bergman's best film ever, as it paints a vivid and visceral portrait of human life and shattered personalities. Some of the film's imagery is troubling and shocking, and the visual language of the movie speaks volumes about the human psyche. Bergman's best creation, this fantastic film is right up there with Citizen Kane, The Godfather, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Casablanca, Apocalypse Now, There Will Be Blood, Network, Goodfellas and Un Chien Andalou as one of the ten best movies in all cinematic creation. Astounding."
1,"Great Film, Wretched Video","I hate to spoil the lovefest... yes, I agree with previous reviews as to the greatness of the work, but people need beware the truly horrendous quality of the transfer. The image and sound quality are appalling; it's discouraging that such a cinematic masterpiece gets such slipshod treatment.My message to the company that released this: get your act together or give the rights to someone who can do the job properly! Don't buy this version!"
2,Not good,"This bits are not good at all. I have never broken a 1/4"" shaft router bit until today.I purchased 3 and only moved then at about 60 in a minute and all three broke within 15 minutes of hand use.Conversely, the exact same style bit from MLCS worked for 8 hours continuous use on my CNC and it never broke it just got a bit dull. Then I sent it in for a lifetime guarantee replacement and MLCS sent me a brand new one.Even at 10.00 each these bits are for the birds."
1,Not worth it,This book is really a complete waste of money - it can only be used for developing quick and dirty solutions using the windows media player and so on.I wouldn't recommend this book even to my most hateful enemy. Unfortunately I was deceived by its looks.
1,"Nope, not worth it","Rated at 1000mAh, just like the original Panasonic battery for my TZ5. Only had 1/2 the life at first. A little over a year later, it only lasted for 4-8 picture and 3-5 minutes' worth of video. After a year and a half, this battery is dead. Not even recommended as a backup. Spend the extra few dollars and get one with a better user rating, more mAh, or better yet, just get the Panasonic.*Update: I returned it under their 3 year warranty (though they now say it's only 2). I had to pay $2 to ship it back to them (which is fine), and now they say I owe them another $7.50 for shipping and handling. Wow, this battery only costs $7.14 new right now.**Update #2: I ignored their request for another $7.50, but after a month or so, they sent me a new one anyway (which has been sitting in my desk ever since, since I bought a higher quality backup battery in the meantime...the Kinamax 1300mAh S007 for about 15 bucks)."
2,Only lasted a year,"Purchased the battery in February 2008. Worked fine size and power wise with my OEM charger and TZ3 camera though it seemed to last a few shots less than the original Panasonic battery (CGA-S007A). However, starting a few weeks ago, the battery refused to charge the full time and dies extremely quickly when placed in my camera. It's been less than 1.5 years. The battery has a 3 year warranty on it but Lenmar charges $7.50 shipping and handling for warranty returns over 90 days.Cheap price but not a recommended purchase."
1,Wrong Battery,The Battery I received was for a completely different camera. Although the company eventually gave me my credit and sent a mailer for the wrong battery nobody contacted me with the correct battery for my camera.
2,Not enough lasting energy.,"It's ok but last only a few hours, at least with my TZ3. I'd buy the Panasonic one. I know for next time."
2,Short life and poor quality control,"Purchased 2 Lenmar DLP007 batteries to be used with Panasonic TZ3 digital camera.One battery was dead after 1 charge cycle. Lenmar did replaced that.Then during the past year, I continued to use Panasonic original battery and the 2 Lenmar batteries on regular rotation. Now, Panasonic battery still allows me to take 100+ photos easily. One Lenmar battery is now completely dead (cannot be recharged). The 2nd Lenmar battery holds only a fraction of the charge, maybe good for 30 photos.So you might be able to get 6 months to 1 year worth of useful life out of the batteries, and then they do not hold the charge any more. These batteries are around half the price of Panasonic original batteries, but the useful life is not half of Panasonic battery."
3,ok battery,"The battery fits fine in the camera and the charger but its life is not too long, so it is good for an extra but that is it."
4,Lenmar lithium battery,Good battery. Does not last as long as the original but works as a good bck-up.
2,lenmar dlp007,"Received a Lenmar branded battery as advertised. Works fine in my Lumix DMC-TZ5, but definitely does not last as long as the OEM Panasonic battery, maybe 1/2 to 1/3 of the life of the Panasonic battery. For the price, its a good emergency backup but wouldn't use it as a replacement of the OEM battery."
4,Very good battery,"I used one for a few days, it was very good.I'm so sorry that I lost it while visiting the Bird's Nest.I have ordered another one for my coming trip to Mexico."
1,LENMAR DLP007 BATTERY IS GARBAGE,"THIS BATTERY IS GOOD FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 SHOTS BEFORE IT MUST BE RECHARGED, WHILE THE ORIGINAL PANASONIC BATTERY IS GOOD FOR 100 TO 200 SHOTS AND VIDEOS BEFORE NEEDING A RECHARGE."
4,my mom loved it,"i bought this dvd for my mom... she's a huge paquita fan... she still watches it whenever she can... if ur a fan, u'll luv it too."
2,Not as good the second time around,"I first read this book when I was in junior high and I loved it. I gave it a second go as a 30 year old and did not have the same experience at all. I didn't like the main characters, I didn't like the writing, I thought the story was weak and there was tons of stereotyping. I felt like the author kept on leading us down dead end allies and then didn't pay up when the climax hit. Not my cup of tea, I suppose."
1,The early stuff was better,"While Breaking God's Heart is not without some merit, it is a shadow of the band's exciting and innovative first two singles issued on the little-known BoogleWonderland label. Clearly Hayman has been corrupted by the cancer of materialism and, as he suggests, is more interested in buying a house than making music with real integrity."
4,Reads like a journal,"I really like Rick Bass' writing style and love affair with the wildness of nature. Like many of us, he struggles with having to be responsible and make a living, but also wanting to break free. Bass' refuge is usually the mountains, but in ""Wild to the Heart"" he finds himself with ""river people."""
4,Great starter book,"This book has all the characters you've heard of, and many you haven't! Small biographies of each person are grouped into different categories: Outlaws, Women, Blacks, Indians, Lawmen, etc. Very informative for someone just getting interested in the West. And good price too!"
5,very satisfied,the book is in good shape it was at a good price too.hard to find book came very fast too.
5,:o),"The first few reviewers said it all... this is a wonderful book, one of my faves, and if you havn't read it yet then pick it up- trust us, you'll love it. I liked Behemoth the cat, and Pilate's dog. And Woland's style, and the fact that The Master was called The Master, and the road Pilate walks down, ...and I could go on all day about this great book. Probably the most lovable thing ever written, this book can garner praise from all kinds of people."
5,I love this book,"I simply love this book. I first read after I had starred as Pontius Pilate in stageproduction of the book. The play had been named ""Satan arrives in Moscow"". After we had finished the play I checked out the book from my library and read it. I just loved it, since then I have read it about 5 or 6 times, I have also read two other of his books and he's my favourite author of all time."
4,Ginsburg Translation,"Given other people's negative reviews of the Ginsburg translation, I ordered (I thought!) a different one, but Amazon provided me with the Ginsburg translation nonetheless. The English is stilted in places but I am enjoying it a great deal and look forward to making a comparison between this and another edition."
1,Do not buy from his publisher,"Unbelievably poor quality edition:No ISBN number anywhere in the bookNo name of the translator anywhere in the bookPoor typesetting, lots of mistakes.Will never buy anything published by this ""publisher""."
2,Book is great-this translation is inadequate!,"I love Bulgakov. I know the Master and Margarita by heart. And I was dismally disappointed in my anticipations of usual delights interacting with this book. I write interacting, because this book is more then just reading material. But back to the translation. It has missing passages, whole paragraphs, it uses wrong terms and notions. I had to return my copy. I expect to have more luck with RICHARD PEVEAR AND LARISSA VOLOKHONSKY translation published in PENGUIN BOOKS 1997, since I pre-viewd it one of the on-line libraries."
5,Something to keep your mind working,I first read the book when I was about 12 years old. Since then I have re-read it numerous times and had a different experience every single time while following the same story. You can read just the story of Christ's execution or enjoy the life of the city of Moscow in the light of Lucifer himself visiting that city. And both stories are beautifully blended together giving you a unique view on things that surround you in everyday life.
5,This book is an intellectual's delight.,"The Master and Margharita is a treasure chest of wild, creative thought and enthralling characters. I recommend it to anyone, particularly those tired of reading painfully dry Jane Austen or Emily Bronte novels."
2,"Great book, poor translation","The Master and Margarita is indeed one of the best written books ever. Unfortunately Glenny's translation leaves much to be desired. It reflects none of Bulgakov's witty, quirky, beautifully flowing style, and reads more like a verbatim translation of a theological treatise."
2,The middle path...,"I am taking the middle path with my view that while the book possesses some poignant prose, it's essential message is one of antiChristianity. As a practicing Theravada Buddhist (who, unlike others, knows enough not to say ""God bless"" when pure Buddhists have no god) I must say I was taken aback by the antiGospel presented in the tale of Pontius Pilate. Pilate is a fascinating character. Yeshua, on the other hand, is presented as quite the opposite of his Jesus of the Gospel counterpart; Yeshua is fearful to the point of cowardice, bumbling and idiotic, he dies violently, does NOT rise (key difference with the Gospel, that any fool with the most remedial knowledge of the Gospel would know), and ends up a corpse buried with other common criminals. How this can substitute for the Gospel, how this shows Jesus coming off fine is WAY beyond me. This is an antiGospel. Those who are not Christian wont be offended. The book is fine fiction, but not to be taken seriously."
1,"creepy, dark, blasphemous book","If you want to feel creepy, weird, dark and half-way insane, please read this book - it's perfect for that. I also thought it was blasphemous."
1,"God, evil is boring!","Unequivocally a heap of putrid, sickening tripe...a collection of overrated, overwritten, underimaginative, repetative fatuousness. Bulgakov is the complete antithesis of Russian greats like Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and Nabakov. Bulgakov's characters are predictable, his plots uninteresting, his descriptions jejune and redundant. If I could I would give it zero stars. Waste of time!"
1,Do not buy this version of M & M,"The Master and Margarita is a wonderful book, a masterpiece, but this version is so flawed that it's hard to see the jewel underneath.I bought this copy because I'd lost my last, almost worn out paperback. It is so full of typographical errors that it is nearly unreadable. Spelling mistakes, no spaces after punctuation, too many spaces after punctuation, odd use of conventions (quotation marks, colons, etc) make this apparently slickly produced book (nice cover photo, by the way) appear to be the work of a first year keyboarding student without any proofreading abilities.The errors are so numerous (many per EVERY paragraph) and so distracting that I am unsure whether I can finish the book before I chuck it in the recycling bin. I hope I can give it zero stars. If I have to select ""one star,"" believe me, it doesn't deserve it."
1,A lousy edition of a great book,"I bought this book because I had worn out a previous copy from several re-readings. Needless to say, the book is worth reading, but I strongly suggest obtaining a different edition from this one. The production quality of this book is zero! Multiple typos in just the first 5 pages, a clumsy typeface, sloppy spacing -- obviously somebody just printed out a poorly produced text document that had never been proofread. I have given the book to a resale shop because it was so bad that I couldn't stand to read it."
1,bootleg edition,"Do not purchase this book published under ISBN 1442133171. It is a scanned and poorly OCR'd copy of another translation. The bootleggers didn't even proofread this before ""publishing"" the scanned edition via CreateSpace. So many typos, the letter z is often swapped with the number 2, etc. Don't get me started on punctuation, esp. pertaining to dialogue. DO NOT BUY!"
3,It's OK,"Not overly engaging or very memorable. One thing i didn't like is the lack of subtitles. In a film like this where people talk softly or with thick accents, subtitles really help. Nothing i dislike more than having to crank the volume to hear a conversation then have music BLAST out of nowhere a second after for a cheap scare. One other problem is doing the shakey camera garbage. Yeah yeah, he was trying to go for camera effects.... pfffft more like, ""I cannot create real tension, through creative lighting or dialog so i'll shake the camera instead"" It doesn't happen alot, but i am just getting tired of horror films using shakey cam as a crutch for creating tension - i guess it is replacing the blasting music jump scare. So it kinda missed the mark on being a memorable ""chilling"" horror film and falls into the ""It's ok"" category."
1,Terrible packing and service.,"Sure, I recieved the right poster. However when it came not only was the packaging TERRIBLE but it was bent everywhere and even torn in some places. That is $7 I will never get back. Thoroughly disappointed with this product and recommend to anyone reading this to not use this poster carrier or maybe even not to purchase posters from amazon. EXTREMELY disappointed."
1,False Advertising,I ordered this poster before Christmas.I received a different poster than what I ordered a week after Christmas.When I contacted Adam Hersch I was told the poster was no longer available.After I left a negative comment on Amazon about this company they started contacting me to see what they could do to resolve the issue.They ended up offering me two other posters of my choice and asked me to remove my comments.I should have waited because I have not seen the other posters and get the run around when I contact them.Poor service.Will NEVER use them again.They are advertising this poster new but told me they could not get it.
4,A fun new series.,"IRREGARDLESS OF MURDER was surprisingly fun for a mystery, and easy to read quickly. The book has wonderful characters, romance, and a few laughs. And it was fun to visit the Adirondacks again. This book promises a sequel, which will mean a good series has been born. I'm looking forward to reading the next one. I found this book through a ""favorite cozies"" list on Amazon.com, and am I glad I did!"
1,"Is it ""Alpha"" or ""Image"" ?????","I really want to get this movie, but am a bit confused as to which version I will get.I have the IMAGE copy bookmarked, but when I got to review details it shows the cover of the Alpha copy !!ALPHA is notorious for putting out the worst pieces of Chit on DVD.How is the Image version ?????"
1,a ripoff,Item is a DVD copy from another source...sound trails image by a few seconds THROUGHOUT....do NOT buy this DVD it is worthless
3,"POOR ""IMAGE"" --- GOOD MOVIE","A GOOD LITTLE MOVIE BUT A BAD PICTURE. THE BACK COVER BOASTS A ""PRISTINE"" NEW FILM-TO-VIDEO TRANSFER FROM ORIGINAL SOURCE MATERIALS. IF THIS IS ""PRISTINE"" THEN I AM HANDSOME (I'M NOT). I HAVE ALWAYS TRUSTED IMAGE STUDIO BUT WILL HAVE TO INVESTIGATE FUTURE PURCHASES FURTHER. STEER CLEAR OF THIS DVD. AFTER READING REVIEWS OF OTHER STUDIOS I AM NOT SURE A GOOD TRANSFER EXISTS ANYWHERE. IT IS CERTAINLY WATCHABLE BUT A LONG DISTANCE FROM ""PRISTINE""."
3,Disappointment,I remember this film coming out when ! ws 10 years old. Finally I got to see it. An OK film but the ending is just tacked on after all the hoopla. What a disappointment!
1,HAHA,"I had to respond to all the reviews saying that this movie is masterfully done. This is a great movie only because it's so incredibly terrible. It's funny, it's cliche, and it's definitely not great film noir. I once watched this movie in a college film class as the teacher's joke. I just wanted to straighten that out before I say that I still love this movie because of its obvious low budget bad production and funny antics that are supposed to be dramatic, like when the two lovers are walking through the street and the director pans up at the street lamp and then down again at the couple about 5 times for dramatic effect and it really just comes off as something that would happen in a spoof. If you're out for a good laugh, this is a great movie to give it. If you really want to watch the pinnacle of great film noir, watch Out of the Past or my personal favorite, Touch of Evil."
