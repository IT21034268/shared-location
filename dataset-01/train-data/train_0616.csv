4,One of the 5 high-tech marketing books I've finished.,"I work in high-tech marketing, and while not the best in the biz, I do make money for my customers. Normally I toss marketing books after two chapters, as pop business or just nonsense.I read this one through because it was a modernized, thoughtful analysis of a universal problem: businesses, like people, get in a rut. This writer has carefully described how success is a trap that prevents a company from catching the next innovation. If I were a manufacturer, it would be particularly frightening, but I have also advised customers in retailing to read it.(Just to be cruel to the ""latest information"" buffs, please note that much of this was noted by Marcus Aurelius, and more recently by Machiavelli. Readers who are scared of fundamental truths should run for the nearest copy of Wired.)"
3,"Content good, CD composition misses the concept","I won't go into the content of Christensen's book, since most professionals who purchase it already know it's a seminal work on the pursuit of innovative new businesses by established firms. What I will go into is how the CD misses the concept of digital media. I have a 2001 Subaru Forester whose stereo has no problems playing audio CDs track by track. However, on Innovator's Dilemma, it appears that there is only 1 track per 100+ minute CD. A single track means that if you want to, say, listen to another CD before finishing this audio-book, you're hosed. With only 1 track, one can only start from the beginning. Turn down the volume at the drive-thru order window and an hour of driving later realize the CD was still playing? Start at the beginning again. Miss part of an excerpt because you got distracted in traffic? With only a single track, there's no rewinding except to restart from the beginning...."
2,Could have been 4 bullets on a PowerPoint slide,"After slogging all the way through this book, I came to Amazon, expecting to see a low rating. I am surprised to see that it has 4.5 stars (as of when I'm writing this review) and a lot of positive comments.On the plus side, the author did take some interesting ideas and combine them in a way that makes sense. I don't mind the hours I spent reading this book because at least it made me think about a couple of things I hadn't realized before.But on the other hand... there are really only a few important concepts in this book, and you can see what they are by reading a couple of the longer reviews here (like Coert Visser's or the one from ""Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham."" There's no need to read the whole thing unless you want to hear those same concepts explained over and over again."
2,Typical dressed-up academic rehash,"Does no-one read anymore? Despite all the assembled love notes to Clayton Christen here, it would seem not. Because this book is a typical re-hash of old ideas in dressed-up tech-friendly clothing.F'rinstance, the idea that prior market leaders are often swept away in new waves of market innovations is as old as Schumpeter. Christensen adds some nice historical frisson to the story -- good for trotting out at Friday beer bashes and impressing management -- but nothing more. It has been documented before (and more entertainingly) in books about NeXT, Digital, Apple, IBM, and others. Even Computer Wars, Morris and Ferguson's more recent vintage book hits the same notes -- and you'd don't have to go back more than a decade to find that one.Anyway, nice stories, but this is the kind of opportunistic and wildly over-applicable theorizing that gives rise to too many conferences. Whoops, too late."
4,My Dream Camera.,"If I could have any camera in the world I would want this one. I would be a super hero. I could make Kathy Bates look like Kate Moss. No Vaseline! On the lens that is. My second 35mm slr, was a Contax Aria. It was very small, very strong, and built like a Ferrari Tank. But they don't make tanks, not contax, no sir, they are in kahootz with Yashica, who is owned by Kyocera which also makes some fine solar paneling. Don't be an idiot, buy me this camera. Oh yeah, 120 baby. 120."
5,There are no words for this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the book that got me started in trading. I trade professionally now. It is a series of interviews with 17 traders, who make great returns and have done so for many years. This book made me realize that trading isn't gambling. I don't know anyone who gambles who last that long. Dr. Van K. Tharp is the last chapter who I have worked with because of Market Wizards and of me tracking them down. He is a professional trading coach, who showed me how to do 1000% returns with drawdowns of only 10%. His company has now trained the best hedge fund in the US and their is no stopping Maricopa. Dr. Tharp has now written a great book called Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom which I have been told has helped many traders. I have met a few of the traders the author of Market Wizards interviewed since I have read the book and most of them are still legends, they are still idols to me."
5,A real page-turner!,"I'll be the first to admit that I read some pretty dry, boring books. This one is definitely not one of them! I read almost 100% non-fiction, with a high concentration in how-to books and biographies. This book appeals to BOTH of those appetites, AND the interviews totally swept me away in a story-like fashion. To top it all off, I really got some good insights into what successful traders do, and how I can apply that to my own trading/investment style. It doesn't matter that the book is from a different time in the markets, investigating traders who no longer trade, or who are perhaps irrelevant. Human nature evolves very slowly over hundreds of years, and those observations in this book are still dead-on. Jack D. Schwager asks the questions you want answered, and his interviews deliver over and over. An absolute must-read for any investor or trader! As some other reviewers have advised, put your trading accounts on hold until you read this one!"
5,Best book on trading,"Market Wizards is so far my favorite book on trading. The interviews contained in this book have both inspired me and helped me to develop my own trading system. Jack Schwager interviews a variety of traders, some devoted to fundamental analysis, others to technical analysis and others to a mix. By looking at the personalities and trading styles of these traders, I got a better idea of what kind of trading system would work with me. I have now read the book several times over, because I continue to find gems of useful information in subtle points made by the traders, and it never ceases to inspire me.The point should be made that this book is not a textbook and it doesn't explore the concepts of fundamental or technical analysis in any depth."
1,Uneven view of Trend Trading,"There are 3 major flaws to this book1) Only Trend Traders are interviewed. I.e. those people who trade with Trends2) the interviews themselves are uneven with a distinct bias towards people that Schwager liked their house (Seykota, Marcus)3) All, except for O'Neill, are extreme liberal democrats with very liberal biases.The crux of the book, excepting of course O'Neill, is that funnny-mentals are something none of them understand so they just watch technical analysis and trade trends. What does this mean? Money management is key since most of their trades are unsuccessful. What makes up MM? No one will say since that's their only REAL edge. In the end, read Lefevre's Stock Operator or Niederhoffers Education. This is boring and basically empty.You do though get to see how these traders live with their wealthand O yes, most went belly up AFTER meeting with Schwager."
2,Good and bad in terms of real meat,The author talks to the professionals who are not willing to share much information on what strategies they use.If you like to learn more about how professionals trade get anything by Toby Crabel.
3,Considering the subject,Pretty dry reading. Only someone really an investing geek would enjoy this. Not sure what insights I got out of it but it was worth a Saturday rainy day read.
4,Many different points of view on trading strategies.,"I enjoyed the inquisitive nature of the interviewer (Schwager). He challenged the traders with various different questions. I feel the book is a must read for any one in the ""Trading Game"""
4,Great Book for confidence building!,"Trading is mostly about information, but I have found you can have all the info in the world and lack confidence, you will miss some major moves. This book is a great confidence builder in the way of the stories tod by Jack. I found it moving in how the interviewees fell down and got back up only to suceed at the highest levels. Its a great read and I highly recommend it..."
5,The Trader's Bible - Lessons from the Masters,"Market Wizards is one of those few books that you just buy. No questions, just buy. No where else can you find such concrete lessons from the best traders of our time. The interview with Richard Dennis alone is worth the admission. This man lays it out straight that anyone can learn to trade. In fact, he proves it with a trading experiment he conducted with complete novices. Market Wizards goes beyond the sound bites so popular on TV. If you want to understand the pyschological underpinnings of trading success, the author Jack Schwager has compiled a worthy read."
5,All Psyched Up.,"This book is great for getting you all psyched up, and wanting to get trading. The stories are great, and informative. Be careful though, the investors interviewed are seasoned pros, so take your time, do your research before you jump headfirst into investing."
4,Trader Insight,An excellent look into how the best professional traders got to where they are to become successful and consistently profitable traders. Lots of good advice for newbie and experienced traders alike. Easy read and captivating.
5,Issues with Trading Psychology? MUST READ.,"The holy grail is YOU. Not your system. Most any reasonably conceived system can show profits, ***if you can stick to the rules***Why do we NOT stick to our rules? Why do we skip winners? Why do we take losers? Why do we cut our profits, and let our losers run?""Everyone gets out of the markets what they want"" - Ed Seykota, my favorite quote from the book. More accurately stated, EVERYONE GETS OUT OF THE MARKET WHAT THEY FEAR MOST.I found the interview with Van Tharpe to be the most informative chapter in the book. Yes, I loved all the others, and some I underlined more than others. Van Tharpe's chapter I have notes and lines every other paragraph. Personally, I found a holy grail system, but lost anyway. Now I know the real holy grail lies within me. Thanks, Jack."
4,Overall a good read,"I am kind of critical to these books. Probably half of the interviews are worthwhile to read. Some trading styles are enlightening. Last chapter is full of BS though. All in all, a good read!"
3,nearly perfect,"Ordered this for a friend who remembered his mother having a handbook when he was small. This one is close but not exactly the one he remembered, though his memory may not be accurate. It arrived quickly and I was satisfied to have it."
4,Buy This To Nearly Complete Your Collection,"At first on appearance this book is thinner then case files 1, but dont be deceived inside is packed full of information from seasons 3 & 4. Even though this 2nd book is written by different authors it still resembles case file 1 on presentation. I fully support anyone buying this to put it next to case file 1."
5,Awosome,"As a teen with scolois I can totally relate to this book. I know what's like to have to wear a backbrace, horrible and uncomfortable. This book helped me at my lowest times, especially when I just wanted talk my back brace off and like throw at the wall."
5,Cool!,"Abby has a twin sister named Anna. Anna has scoloisis. Abby tries to be protective. nstead, this gets on with a fight!"
2,The idea is better than the execution on this Stink Blaster,"I picked this up in the hopes of gaining an edge in office warfare. So admittedly I'm not in the target demographic. Maybe if I was a kid my imagination would make up for the shortcomings of this toy.Anyhow, the Stink Blaster is huge and cool looking, and the stink cartridges definately have a bad smell. But that just doesn't translate to an ability to ""blast"" a smell across the room, or even a cubicle. It will push a puff of air 6-8 feet, but the most common reaction was, ""What is that?"" and after I tell people, ""Ok, try it again"" and then they stick their noses up in the air and sniff around: ""I kinda smell something, but not really.""Since it's only value is as a prank device, and it doesn't work very well, I recommend you take a pass on this one."
2,"All Show, But No Go","This toy looks great and is a really good concept, but it does not deliver. My seven year old son was excited to receive one for his birthday. Once he tried it out though, he was super disappointed. It looks really cool, but hardly shoots a smell - let alone a stink. We took it back to Toys R US and bought a remote controlled flying saucer. He loves it!"
4,My son loves it,"Our whole family likes playing with this toy. The thing is that we can't find the refill stink pods. We have checked everywhere we know to check and no one wants to use us find them. Even the manufactor won't help. Like I said we love the toy and want to continue to play with it, but without the refill stink pods the toy is useless."
3,"I am a big fan of jonathin quentle, and I think this toy is not as good as I Expected","I am a big fan of Jonathin Quentle, and I think that this toy is kinda bad. As Jonathin Quentle says, the stink tends to run out. It is best if you use it a few times right when you take it out of the box. This toy is okay-bad."
1,This toy stinks,What a horrible toy! The instructions were vague. The cartridges did not seem to load correctly. One stink cartridge broke on me. The smell is gross (old socks and trash says the 9yr old recipient). The toy is in the garage now where it won't offend anyone. My sister gave this to my son for Christmas (probably to get back at me for all the times I farted in her face). Next year her son gets a steel drum.
3,Christmas gift,"This toy was bought for our 5 year old son. He was really excited about getting it but disappointed in it. It does not really blast out a stink. It comes with only two cartridges, not labeled. He shot it out a couple times and got bored with it very quickly. [...]"
4,Definately stinks!,"My 8yr old bought this & had a blast stinking his brother & I out! I have read some of the other reviews, but I'm telling you..if your in a confined space with this thing you WILL be covering your nose! My son was using it in the car..or also in a room that closes up..you will see a difference!"
1,What is that smell?,"Ahh what can you say about stink blasters? How bout that they, stink. Not their smell but their performance. My son shot it at me and i couldn't even smell it. My son was so excited, he practically started crying when i didn't start screaming like the people in the commercial. The only way I could smell it was when he practically shot it up my nose! If you would like your nose to start bleeding, buy this toy. It's great for causing injuries. Its more likely to poke out ur eye than make you pinch ur nose. It practically fell apart after the first eight shots. If you like wasting money, buy this product. On the other hand u could just make awful smells urself. Anyway, I will soon be going back to toys r us to get my money back."
1,My house stinks now!,"Let me just say DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! My 4 year old son just had to have it, he couldn't wait to get us all with it. He loves it because it is so gross and he just likes to irritate everyone. But as a parent, it is in no way fun. My son shot a few rounds off at us on Christmas morning and as of 8pm the day after my house still smells like skunk and trash. I have lit candles and sprayed air freshener and still I smell it. This horrible toy is now banned from my house and is only to be used outside. Thanks MOM for buying your grandson this, it might just be left at your house!"
1,What a DUMB idea!!,What kind of kid wants to get sprayed with discusting smells?? What kind of kid WANTS to spray discusting smells???? NOT ME!!This has got to be one of the dumbest ideas EVER!!stink blasters!?????Hmmmm......
4,A kind of dark book,"This is a different, creative book that could be kind of dark for a children's book. The plot is interesting, when a new girl, desperate for friends, joins up with a girl who is in a secret club. The club bosses Anna (the new girl) around for a time, until more members are introduced. When Anna is put on trial for sticking up for a younger member, the action starts to pick up. Overall I liked the book, although in some parts it is a little bit slow-moving, but the author makes up for it by adding suspense, like the part when Anna is made to sit on the roof to spy on one of the club's leaders. It has a dark side to it, when kids start taking their own ""secret societies"" a little too seriously. The characters are extremely well-developed and I really cared about some and hated others. I definitely recommend this book."
1,PeterDarling is correct.,"This book is a dangerously misleading one.This Gosman guy is an ..., and a grouchy one at that. The practice of parenting should be based on a dovetailing of fundamental personal values with scientific research evidence in the area of developmental psychology, not some angry guy's ranting about ""kids these days"".He gets one star for one or two novel behaviour modification tips I'd never heard before. Most of it was ... But stay away from this book: if you are not knowledgeable regarding psychology to begin with, it'll poison you, and if you ARE a little more sophisticated, it'll bore and disgust you."
2,"Badly written, superficial and hostile","Gosman's book is really bad. He has one idea, and he repeats it over and over -- you can guess what it is. The book is stuffed with obviously fake examples of the problem he claims to be highlighting, and has now turned into a mini-industry, and the writing is straight out of magazine articles from the 1950s. He has no actual training in what he writes about, nor is he a professional. He really seems to hate children, and this is a constant presence in the book. Reading it will leave you with a little bit of a headache, and the idea that children today are basically evil, materialistic monsters. Particularly irritating are the endless references to how things used to be, when kids were __________ (fill in the blank: more respectful, kinder, less materialistic, more hardworking, whatever). Dumb, obvious, and nasty."
5,"The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--Western Insanity, Howard Style","Robert E Howard's Western heroes create hilarious chaos wherever they go, from devastation at a crooked Election Day to the insanity produced by a young giant of a man going into a civilized town for the first time in his life. And darned near leveling the whole community. By accident.Each & every story reads like the Saturday Night Live crew playing the Man With No Name.Fine Westerns, don't get me wrong. But lots of laughs, too.Robert E Howard is most famous for his ""Conan The Barbarian"" creation.But this collection of Western tales proves his talent wasn't limited to that.He was too good a writer to be limited to that.If this item interests you, you might also enjoy--Daisy Kutter: The Last TrainThe Hipster gives it a Big Thumbs UP!"
2,Howard at his weakest,"R E Howard is one of my personal favorite authors, and I enjoy much of his work in the western genre. That said, I just couldn't get into his Breckenridge Elkins and other humorous westerns. By far Howard is at his best in his dark work, and that shows in the stories contained in this book. The situations Elkins and others find themselves in are intended to be hilarious but strike me more as ludicrous. Their redundancy doesn't help matters. The strongest quality of these stories is Howard's powerful writing, but that can't overcome their deficiencies--for me anyway. To anyone wanting to read Howard's work, I recommend looking for the other collections in this Bison Books series or the volumes in Del Rey's ongoing reprints of Howard's work as close to his intended vision as possible. This is a volume for the Howard completist only, and even then I'd have a hard time recommending it."
3,Getting By or Becoming Fluent?,"While I have enjoyed reading 'Speak Like a Native' and recommend you buy it, I am somewhat disappointed that the focus seems to be more on faking it rather than actually learning real strategies to assist one in becoming fluent in a new language.I highly recommend you read Mark Frobose'sThink and Grow Fluent (Secrets of Language Success)andAutomatic Fluency - Nine Steps to Speaking Languages and Finishing Fluent (Secrets of Language Success Series)to compensate for this deficiency.Both should be of great help when used in conjunction with 'Speak Like a Native'."
3,A bit disappointing,"I bought this book based on several positive reviews. I teach Spanish and am also a student of languages. I am always searching for more help to improve my learning and that of my students. This book started out fine but then the suggestions changed to ways to ""get by"" in a foreign language rather than actually working to improve mastery. While ""getting by"" is often necessary especially in a language one does not know well or does not want to master, I was looking for ""tips"" for moving toward fluency."
5,Excellent,I read this book twenty years ago. This is a valuable book for begginers and laymen alike.I hope it finds its way back into print.
3,"Great book, good documentary, but . . .","The book is one of my all-time favorites. But it is true, as some reviewers have said, the documentary is not in-depth enough. If you weeded out the repeats of ideas and unnecessary dramatic details, it oculd be a 1/2 hour documentary. But, I might have liked this much better if I had not read the book first.I would like to recommend another book, along the same lines: Conquests and Cultures, by Thomas Sowell. I'd love to see that one as a documentary."
3,Read the book,"The CDs were kind of interesting in that they covered some material not in the book, particularly the 3rd CD on the Dutch in Africa. Also a touching moment when Diamond breaks down when visiting a children's hospital in Zambia.Overall tho, maybe 1/10th the information of the book, in 1/2 the time it would take to read the book. I prefer the more information dense format."
3,Excellent Story - Overly Repetitive,"If you deleted the constant repetition of the title and some of the scenes put in for their emotional value only, it would have been a much better product.Geography and luck play a major role in the early formation of civilizations. Unfortunately, the author does not expand beyond that simple theory and show how these advantages/disadvantages could be squandered/overcome by societies. His theory does explain why the Europeans were able to conquer most of the world, but does does not explain why it was the Europeans and not the Arabs, Egyptians, Greeks, etc... who had a much larger ""headstart"" than the Dutch and English.Overall it was well worth my time and I recommend this DVD."
1,5 mins of brilliant profound insight stretched into 3 hours,"Do not buy this. Rent it, maybe. Better yet, rent it, turn on subtitles, mute the sound, and run it at double time, assuming you can read fast. Massive amounts of repetition in the script.A program from, hello, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, should at least get the geography right. Cape Town is not remotely the most southern tip of Africa. Total bull and a popular error. Go read a map.Next, the phrase ""Guns germs and steel"" gets uttered SO frequently that soon it becomes unbearable. My partner and I took to torturing each other by saying it aloud for the next 2 days.This is yet another documentary by a director who feels it necessary to show a man breaking into tears and then deliberately filming him while he's such a mess, he can't enunciate. If I cared for this manipulative drivel, I wouldn't have cancelled my cable TV.A brilliant man's theory in a book ruined by stupid, cutesy direction and painful scriptwriting."
3,Incomplete Hence One Sided,"I guess the book, on which this is based, would have been better bcz an excerpt from the book in the 2nd DVD seems detailed.But the DVD itself seems lacking a lot of facts, like- there's no connection between the migrating nature of nomads and the development of weapons or steel/industry, compared to their counterparts.- Or why didn't the forest tribes ever explore the world outside like nomads.- Another major fact missed out is the reason that drive one society to dominate the other. Color is one recent example but then even a colored race had an empire in Egypt while the Romans ruled Europe......so to summarise the DVD is just 1 dimension, which one may view along with other works - like Civilasation, by BBC - much much better than this"
3,Read the book instead,"Diamond's book had some amazing insights. These insight do not come across in this documentary. The first episode is quite good because it shares some of Diamond's genuine insights. The remaining two episodes are okay, but they are not closely linked to Diamond's theory."
1,"Boring, shallow and repetitive","This production seems to have been aimed at a 4th grade level. It belabors the obvious (guns were more deadly than spears) while leaving huge questions unaddressed (why didn't the Bantus, with their sophistocated, advanced society based upon advantageous geography, domesticated animals, crops, etc. create similarly deadly weapons and colonize Europe?)Instead, it repeats the same statements (I gave up counting the number of times Dr. Diamond said ""As I wrote in my book Guns, Germs and Steel"" or ""It's a journey I began while in Papua New Guinea."") The recaps of narrative and visuals (I also gave up counting the pan shots of smallpox victims, or men carefully loading guns) starts to make one feel like we're in an endless loop.At best, there's an hour of material here. Does it do justice to Dr. Diamond's work? Sadly, I think it does, because if you've read the book, you'll know his theory is full of holes."
4,Good but Diamond Has an Agenda,"I read the book and I think the videos are good. I think Diamond is a left-winger. Guns, Germs and Steel is pretty much non-stop European bashing. Somewhat over simplified, what about all the the barbarians that beat up on the Europeans? Does not give much credit to the good Europeans may have done in their expansion."
1,claptrap,"That which is original in this program is biased and untrue. That which is true is not original. This piece of environmental and liberal hyperventilation steals liberally from true scholarship, such as ""Rats, Lice, and History"" by Hans Zinsser. It makes obvious observations in such a self congratulatory style as to be nauseating. Diamond's on camera mugging and fake shows of emotion are hideous. National Geographic has sunk to new lows to screen this."
1,Disappointed,"The documentary is not free of biased opinions. Obvious and politicized, does not say the ALL truth."
2,DVD IS POOR CHOICE FOR GOOD CONTENT,"After listening to the audiobook five years ago, I got the DVD from the library hoping the video would enhance the experience. Unfortunately, the ""background"" music often drowns out the spoken narrative. Since the narrative, unlike the obtrusive music, is critical to understanding the documentary, I gave up on the DVD about 20"" in. I highly recommend the audiobook, but don't waste your money or your time on this poorly made DVD."
4,"Yeah, it's different, but...","I can see why some would claim that this story is very far removed from what we know in the Star Wars Universe. But its the weirdness I like. Jedi can be screwed up too, look at the flaws of the later Old Republic Jedis. Check out Outbound Flight for a really good example. This light and dark war serves as a historical restructuring point for both Sith and Jedi. Yeah, creepy cute/violent art may not work for some, but some times you need to step out of the box a little. You REALLY need to read Darth Bane Path Of Destruction to get the most out of it Jedi vs. Sith though."
2,Nothing Special,"This comic details the story behind the Valley of the Jedi from the Dark Forces computer games and graphic novels. It gives more information about the entire conflict between the Jedi and Sith. The story revolves around three cousins who are transported to the battleground and proceed to follow their different paths. The story itself is rather bland....having read the Dark Forces novel, I can say it provides more information, but it's not really pertinent to the Star Wars storyline....yet. The ending leaves the possibility that we'll see some more of these characters later on, but for the most part, I wouldn't recommend this story on the basis of the plot. The art was ok. It appeared to be more Manga than other Tales books which I didn't particulary care for, but overall, there are some nice shots. If you are really into the Star Wars storyline, it's a nice addition, but otherwise, stick with the novels."
4,U.S ending,"loved this movie when it came out. It has the Flavor of the late seventies punk scene in London. I found it later on video and was appalled to find the last few minutes missing. This changed the whole message and meaning of the movie, they opted for a more upbeat ending. I am hoping that a DVD release of the Movie will restore the Film to its original state. Its a good film anyway, but I would encourage to look for the UK version if poss"
2,Misleading,Francis Ford Coppola should not be listed as an author of this book. I bought it because I thought Copppla was one of the authors. He is quoted in the book but he did not write it. I think this is misleading to readers.
1,Needs Revision,Sloppy editing and contradictions distract from an otherwise good story. The review in The Wine Spectator got it right. How about a revised edition?
4,A Sense of Place,"I found this to be a fascinating account of the story behind the renaissance of one of California's oldest wineries. It has a good mix of characters and history, as well as an engaging attention to detail which should captivate anyone interested in wine making and the struggles involved in resurrecting a heritage. Kolpan's erudite approach to the more esoteric aspects of viticulture is an added benefit."
1,Buy the Wine Instead,"As a resident of the Napa Valley, I have observed our local industry for almost 30 years, and as ernest and well-meaning as this suthor appears to be, this is a promotional piece, not a well-researched book. Mr. Kolpan simply interviewed and recorded the self-serving comments of people who stand to gain the most. The much bigger, and more accurate story remains to be told."
1,Very Disappointing,"Even after reading a couple of bad reviews (which refer to factual errors), I bought this book thinking it would be a good read. I am extremely disappointed. What should have been a great story reads instead like a term paper with a lot of strung together quotes. It could have been written by Coppola's public relations department--it's that boring."
4,Finally..a good alternative to Rosai and Sternberg!!!,"When I found everybody goes for Rosai or Sternberg books, I decided to go for something different and found this. I think I did the right thing! The new edition of this book is excellent. Very organized, up-to-date information, and very nice pictures. The text is easily read. The online version of the book makes the task of searching much easier (especially when you feel lazy to pull the heavy books of Sterberg or Rosai from the shelves and surf their pages!!! - they do not exist online!!). If you think to go for this book, you will love it. However, Sternberg has more details than this book (I love the tables in Sternberg)- this is why I didn't give this book five stars- but modern surgical pathology is more organized , concise and exists online. If you combine both in your library, you are set in general surgical pathology."
4,Great book,"A new entry in the comprehensive textbooks of surgical pathology, Modern Surgical Pathology is well written resulting in an easy read. It was also the first of the major surg path textbooks to include a CD rom. The CD rom contains additional images that are not in the book supplementing the reader's leraning. I originally bought this book because all of the other residents had Rosai, Silverberg, or Sternberg and I figured that I could always have access to the other texts, however, I have preferred to read Modern Surgical Pathology."
4,Sammy Keyes and the Hollywood Mummy,"Sammy Keyes is a believable character, overall a very cool kid. She knows what is real and trusts her gut instincts, whether it's discovering what is truly going on in a Hollywood mansion full of beautiful, aspiring television and movie stars (guarded over by an aging manager who is fully obsessed with all things Egyptian) or in connecting on a satisfying level with her mom, who is trying so hard to become a success in Hollywood that she has totally re-invented herself and left Sammy temporarily out of the picture. There are surprises galore, and just when you think you have the mystery figured out -- you don't! Sammy's friend, Marissa, is a perfect foil as she challenges and questions Sammy when she needs it. A fun and worthwhile read, middle-school kids will want more action-filled mystery fiction like this one."
5,The best series of books for girls around 12 years old.,"Sammy Keyes books are my FAVORITE books of all time, because I think most girls can relate to one of the characters in the book and everybody has their own Heather Acosta brat at their school. It is not a way out there mystery, it's one you can follow and become very interested in. I have read ALL the Sammy Keyes books and I want more of them! Scratch that, I NEED more of them. I want more to come out soon!"
4,Great Cook Book - Great Recipes,"I read the other more critical reviews of this book on Amazon and I'm surprised. I love this cook book. The recipes are easy, fast and really tasty. The ingredients are easy to get and if you don't have fresh, you can use frozen or dried (such as herbs). I love the book and have recommended it to friends who were equally satisfied."
2,Disappointed,"Everything I have tried in this cookbook is terrible. From fish to chicken, soup to breakfast. Poor, bland flavoer. All of the recipes are a LOT more trouble than they are worth. MANY other healthy cookbooks out there with MUCH tastier recipes."
2,"Great pictures, disappointing results","I've had this cookbook for ten months now, and for the most part it now sits on the shelf, gathering dust. Why? Although the recipes are unique and creative and the pictures look great, the results for almost all of the recipes I've tried are a great disappointment. I believe that healthy, fat free, low sodium cooking doesn't have to be bland, but that's what the majority of these recipes are. And while other readers have found the recipes to be quick, I found them to be quite time-consuming. There are a few recipes in the book that I like and frequently return to, but too few to justify owning the book."
3,How much lemon zest can a person eat?,"I use this book when I need a quick side dish or a simple entree. But the most of the recipes are pretty boring and bland. My other ""healthy cooking"" books make wholesome food delicious by using creative seasonings. The Mayo Clinic puts the grated zest of a citrus fruit in every other recipe and leaves it at that. Haven't they ever heard of herbs and spices?"
1,A great collection of bland recipes,"The photography is the best part of this book. The pictures make the dishes look extremely appealing, but unfortunately the taste doesn't follow through. For example, none of the recipes include salt in the ingredient list. This allows the nutrion list to look nice in the sodium category, but who cooks with NO salt?I do find the book useful for ideas; for example, there's a recipe for black bean chili over polenta. That's a nice combination which I would never have considered. But I followed the recipe for the chili, and it was tasteless! The addition of some imaginative spicing turned the chili into something which had taste.This book strikes me as the ultimate in health books which make people think that healthy food has to be tasteless and a chore to eat. It's not that way at all! There are many other cookbooks available which describe dishes which are both healthy and delicious."
5,This video is truly personal and helpful!,"When you work with a personal trainer, you get special attention and support that is incredibly hard to duplicate in a video for the masses. That's not a problem here. This is a very personal tape.Suzi Lonergan clearly gets how you might not be as up to the task as she is. She brings you through her workout without making you feel like you have to chase her to keep up.The workout is challenging, but presented in a way that allows you to find your own level. Bottom line..she takes care of you.In fact she educates you about how to safely train. If you have a bad back, you still get to play. If you want to increase the challenge, she shows you how.Lonergan's experience shows. She obviously knows the difference between just working up a sweat and working on your health. I would recommend this tape for people at all levels."
5,WOW I feel rejuvinated...Thanks Suzi,"I always was feeling tired and lifeless. I have more energynow and I am preparing for our new baby to arrive next year.Thanks again,WL Brown"
4,Suzi Lonergan's BodyPower - Pilates!,Good instructor - good explanations and examples. A great pliates workout. Instructor seems very knowledgable.
5,"An excellent, easy fitness program",Pilates is a form of exercise that is similar to yoga. It uses the whol body and lengthens and strengthens muscles. I've been doing Pilates for several years and love it. This video is great for both beginners and intermediate Pilates students. It gives a great workout and it's easy to do. I highly recommend it!
3,OK Basic Workout,"Suzi Lonergan's tape is good for a basic workout, but don't expect it to get your heart pumping. The tape is a good introduction to mat-based Pilates. An annoying fact - she tells you in the beginning to follow different folks on the video if you have a bad back or a bad neck, which is great. But she wastes time by telling you again and again before each exercise. I end up fast-forwarding the tape to get to the real workout. So I guess you get a workout of your remote too."
4,Great Talent!,"Out of all the CD's I have (I have thousands) this is one of my favorites. Roy Ayers talent is truly underrated, even though he is a genius and a master at his craft. His music is soulful, original, jazzy, and very funky! After hearing his music you can definitely see that he helped pave the road for future funk artists like George Clinton and Parliament."
4,Everybody loves the sunshine,"I listen to this CD love fantasy,by Roy Ayerswhen Im driving in my minivan, while working in my carIm in sales,and just wanted to say this CD really makes me feelthe music in my soul. Especially, when you are under lot of stress. Thanks Roy for that kool music! Ive been into your musicsince I was 15 years old, Im 41 now. Thanks Roy, Peace Don."
3,nice but difficult to use,"i had been looking for a product like this for some time. in theory its supposed to make these little corn shaped and textured corn bread sticks (basically mini corns of cob) but the reality is that the pattern on the pan is so intricate that the batter ""sticks"" after baking and is near impossible to remove in the intended form of the design. maybe someone with more baking experience can make this thing work properly but i have had no such luck."
5,Cast iron corn bread,I ordered 2 cast iron baking pans. They were delivered on time and just perfect. I wanted them for our Family Thanksgiving in VA. Each individual corn bread came out looking just like little corns with great roasted coloring. They were moist and all disappeared. I recommend these pans to all the cooks that love to make a difference on their table for their family or friends.
5,great recording,"Sound quality was excellent, even though some of these songs were recorded 50 years ago."
5,The Lost Battalion,"Great movie well done and very realistic, the story is one that should be remembered for the future generations. Authentic representation with correct gear and weapons for the most part."
4,"A World War 1, story.........","It's based on a true story, it is very interesting how the trench warfare was faught, many men were lost, giving their life for their country. It's hard to say or experience what those men went through, but this movie puts the base and the actual experience of what they had to go through. It has a little bit of everything, from airplanes, artillary, machine guns, sniper action. It's a movie that is recommended to everyone who likes war movies. Although it cannot be compared to Saving Private Ryan or any recent war based movie. It is a well done movie."
5,The Yanks New Where They Were...,The lost battalion wasn't lost. They new where they were. A fantastic movie. Rick Schroeder was excellent and the authenticity of this film is first rate.
2,Enough with the hand-held camera stuff already!,"Am I the only person getting tired of recent war movies like this one which are shot in the ""Saving Private Ryan"" style? The hand-held camera technique for intense combat scenes worked in SPR, but now it's getting predictable and just plain annoying. This made-for-TV movie reeks of low production values. It looks like a bunch of WWI reenactors went out in the woods one day with a videocam to make a war movie, but instead ended re-making ""The Blair Witch Project."""
5,History personified...,"My grandfather, great uncle, and great-great uncle were in World War 1. My grandfather was wounded by gas, and my great-great uncle was killed by a shell.Watching this movie gave me a better idea of what these fellows really looked and acted like. The scene of the soldier being obliterated gave me a better persepctive of my own relative's death.I think Rick Schroeder was great, but then again I believe they all did a superb job. The equipment was marvelous and appeared quite accurate right down to the P-17 Enfield rifles.Very graphic, but curiously little cursing (thank you!). Not a child's movie, but recommended watching for the serious history student."
5,Great Depiction!,"Everything I've read about this event since viewing the film (which inspired me to research further) indicates that this was a faithful depiction of events. (In a discussion group on A&E, the son of one of the survivors agrees!) The jerky filming style in the midst of the battle adds to the queasy feeling we should ALL have in the pits of our stomachs at the idea of such devastation. It is WELL acted, avoids almost ALL maudlin sentiment (which can't be said of Private Ryan) and the knowledge that it really happened increases the impact of it. As an enthusiastic viewer of war films and amateur WWI historian, I HIGHLY recommend it."
4,Well done!,"Perhaps it was too long ago for anyone to have memories that could correct innaccuracies but few movies of the first world war seem to get it right. This one captures the American experience in that war like few others have. Drama and action together bring out a story of depth, courage, tolerance, and forbearance in the crucible of adversity. I watch it again and again. Hard to believe it was made for TV and not a major picture. Still one of the great war-stories to capture the American public."
4,lost boys,I have viewed this movie and it has excellent visual effects depicting world war one.the story line is flowing and precise.Acting roles are well presented and adhere to the story line
5,gritty realism,"with most war movies..shot in color, this movieshowing the heroism in the thick of battle is a goodcolor movie about ww 1 events, and the cast of characterschosen to fight.ricky schoder was excellect cast as the commanding major."
5,Accurate war movie,I brought this movie for my partner who has been searching for it in New Zealand stores for a long time. He thoroughly enjoyed it and was very impressed with the fact that it is a true story. I also watched it and thought it had a very good story line. Although i must say that i wouldnt have known it was Rick Schroder if it didnt have his name on the cover. I very different role for him which he played very well.
5,Awesome,"This movie should be on every high school students list of movies to watch. It gives an accurate account of trench warfare and it's an awesome movie. I have now watched this movie at least 10 times and I'm sure that I'll watch it again. The acting is fantastic, Rick Schroder should have won an Academy Award for his part in this movie. He makes you feel his pain as he watches his men die. When a women puts a war movie at the top of her movie favorites,that's great acting!"
5,The Lost Battalion,"Excellent World War I movie that is based on actual events. I was VERY happy to get this movie because with all the looking around for it that I did, Amazon.com was one of the only places where it was actually available. If you like war movies, this is one movie to get. I think one of the next movies I get from here will be Sargeant York. I hope Amazon.com has it in stock."
5,Very fine movie!,"The story line and action of this film is easy to follow and well paced. What I enjoy the most is the varied population among the American force. New York ""gangsters"" as the movie describes, along with Jewish, immigrant, and ""hicks"" from the West. Professional soldiers from the Spanish-American War gain respect for educated and principled officers who are new to combat. Bottom line is that as the desperation of the Lost Battalion grows, the melding of American soldiers also increases. Prejudices fall away, isolation ends, class differences disappear, and a true American soldier emerges - one tough son-of-a-bitch. And that is what we always have been."
4,The Lost Battalion - better than average war story.,"Schroder makes a believable leader in this story. Much of the action sequence is done in the same style as ""Saving Private Ryan"", if you liked that, you'll like this.Better than average story of the squad who makes their objective, and then is left for loss by their commander.The story and action captures your interest, and you develop a respect for friend and foe alike."
3,Almost a great movie,"There are not many movies, it seems, based on WWI. This is understandable, because WWI was really a low point in history. This movie tells a great story, but suffers from the usual Hollywood deficiencies when it comes to war and violence. It is more interested in the drama than the actual experience of war. The best WWI movie I have seen to date is Beneath Hill 60. Other good WWI movies include Gallopoli (with Mel Gibson) and a older Kirk Douglas movie of which I cannot remember the name. I would give this movie 3.5 stars if I could -- definitely worth viewing."
5,Lost Battalion delivers.,"If you are a fan of the war genre or just love a good tale than this movie delivers. Rick Schroder leads a strong telling of the story of one American Battalion in WW1 that earns glory by its conduct while surrounded by the Hun. War is not glorified but honor, loyalty and friendship are. Worth every penny."
5,Excellent Movie,This is a great movie about an amazing group of men that should never be forgotten. Anyone that appreciates history or heroism will enjoy this story.
5,"""The Rated 'R' Superstar""","hey man, if you love Edge, you'll love this. all of the matches are bad a## and its awesome to see a rise to the top and to STAY THERE AND ONLY GET BETTER."
3,Finally....a DVD for the Rated-R Superstar,"I gotta say its about time WWE put together a DVD about Edge, Smackdown's current Rated-R Superstar. I think some of the matches that should be put on the DVD should be:Edge's debut in June 19981st IC Title match vs. Jeff JarrettAny ladder match (even though most of them wound up on the Ladder Match DVD)IC Title matches vs. Christian, vs. Test, vs. William Regal, vs. Randy OrtonWWE Title matches vs. John Cena (New Years Revolution 2006), vs. John Cena vs. RVD (RAW 7/3/06)World Title matches vs. Undertaker (May 2007), vs. Undertaker vs. Batista (Armageddon 2007)Any title matches vs. BatistaAlso his King of the Ring victory in 2001.I don't know what WWE has planned for this, but it should be good."
1,Wonderful Job--of taking the title from another man's book,"Leonard Wibberley wrote a beloved novel in the 60s, ""The Mouse That Roared"".This **IS NOT** it!Nice way to boost your sales--trying to confuse the bookbuying public.Cheap & cheesy trick.The real book--The Mouse That Roared: A NovelIn future, consider ethics."
5,Making for a movie!!!!!,All I can say about this book if you are trying to figure out if you want to buy this book--- Hurry UP! U don't know what you are missing!This was by far one of the BEST books I have ever read---has so many twists u don't know what is coming! U will not be disappointed in this! If they had more stars you best believe I would give it as many as I could put on this page! Thats how good this book is! Trust and believe me---BUY THIS BOOK!
3,White BIRD,I will always remember when Will and Hanna moved away.This book was kind of sad and a bit funny.I think others should read this book because it`s good.
5,White Bird,What I remember about White Bird is that the bird was white and it was John Thomas's favorite bird. I think this book was a cool book to read because it was exciting and adventurous and that John Thomas was really sad when someone stole White Bird from his house.
4,Like lava rocks but Supra+ is better,Lava rocks is discontinued product and I got Supra+. Very happy with Supra+. Works as described which is the most important thing for my fish.
2,"Earth, wind and who?","I am not familiar with most of these songs. The quality of the recordings are very nice and professional, but I don't recognize but only two of the songs. Anyway, if you are looking for Earth, Wind & Fire's greatest hits, do yourself a favor: DO NOT CHOSE THIS ONE !!!"
5,Great for Intermediate/Advanced Review,"I loved this set so much, I bought it twice. The first time it was actually stolen from my car. I was thinking I might try something else, but I ended up purchasing this set again, and I'm glad I did. I have 4+ years of Spanish instruction and can't seem to get past proficiency to the fluency level. My major problem is conjugating verbs quickly (along with vocab). This set really reviewed all the tenses, slowly and quickly to get me to conjugate quickly. It uses the vosotros form--which is new to me. It doesn't introduce a lot of new vocab, however. I wish it did, but then again the set itself never claimed that vocabulary would be their emphasis."
2,I was spoiled by Pimsleur,"After finishing Pimsleur Spanish I and Spanish II (the gold standard for language learning), I thought I would take a break and build more verb vocabulary before begining Pimsleur III. I am being generous with two stars. The main instructor on the tape is also the main Spanish speaker and is a non-native speaker with rapid, pressured speech and everything is said dramatically. The male native speaker I swear is a Hispanic Bella Lagosi, his voice has so much bass it is difficult to understand. These tapes are definiteley low budget. ""Master All the Tenses and Speake Fluently"" all in four tapes! I should have known better. I am now on Pimsleur III. I think Marcel Danesi needs to listen to them and see how it is done. The idea of verb vocab building is a great idea but this isn't it."
3,NFT Guide to Manhattan,"I give this three stars not because the book is bad but because I personally didn't find it useful. If I lived in Manhattan, I would seriously think this the best guide ever. But I live in Brooklyn, where, the guide seems to say, we don't have bus routes, hospitals, or even ZIP codes.I think the book is terribly cute and just the right size, so I can't fault the editors for saving space. And I too disagree with the reviewer who said this book is for tourists; I think it's best for people who are relative newcomers to Manhattan. I can see it being very helpful in apartment hunting as well. It gives the location of everything from post offices and police stations to bagel and coffee shops. But only in Manhattan. So don't bother buying this guide if you live in one of the outer boroughs."
1,Type to Small!,"I bought this book for my first visit to New York City. Imagine my surprise when the type was to small to read. I sure there's lots of great info, but my middle-aged eyes couldn't make it out. Perhaps it should come with a magnifying glass."
1,Did not do its job. No Good,"Despite trying on 2 different cars, it did not work as hangers were too short. Adjustment holes were inadequate and I had to drill to attach, removing the chance of return."
3,Decent... you just have to ....,"this thing works as advertised, but i don't trust the flimsy straps that came with it, so i repurposed some thicker straps that go around the inside of my car instead of using the included small straps plus door hooks. the bars are super solid & well made, but the bar-holders don't seem to be as good. nonetheless, i'm happy w/ the purchase."
3,it's ok,it's ok for a small kayak but it isn't made to haul 2 kayaks let alone a 15ft and a 12ft kayak any kind of bad wind will cause the plastic feet to break.
3,OK for light usage,"Ok for occasional light usage. Not solid enough for heavy usage and highway driving: the clips don't hold on very tight, the bars are round."
5,"The Best Blues of Louis Armstrong,WC Handy & Co.","I generally prefer more modern jazz to Louis Armstrong;but there are generally exceptions to anything-and this is really beautiful stuff.The cd kicks off with a terrific version of Handy's timeless classic,'The St. Louis Blues' with Armstrong playing and singing with Velma Middleton-and keeps kickin'.Also included are interviews of Armstrong and Handy-and the sound will blow you away.."
4,The Louis cd,Yes. The Louis cd. It came very promptly. I was looking forward to it and I was playing it in no time. It came perfectly new.
5,Marc Cohn was right,"MC makes a reference to WC Handy in ""Walking in Memphis""; on a whim, I bought this album. Absolutely great!"
5,Louis never sounded better,This CD sounds wonderful! LIke it was recorded yesterday. The playing and the vocals are energetic and very bluesy. This is the Louis Armstrong CD for blues lovers. The classic St. Louis Blues is the best version I've ever heard. Great pick.
1,Pieces did not fit,Top part of the puzzle did not go together correctly. I wanted to frame it when I was done but I could not because of misshaped pieces.
5,Holding up with the test of time,This is one of the hundreds (640 to date) of christmas and holiday CD's in my collection. SNOWED IN finds its way to the top of my playlist every year. I have given many copies as gifts to share this delightful Christmas confection. Fun fresh takes on holiday standards and a sprinkling of original songs. What a delight. Not to be missed. How awesome the boys still believe in the joy of Christmas; yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus.
5,Rock And Roll Christmas!,"This is by far my favorite Hanson album. It just gets you in the right mood, it doesn't even have to be Christmas, you just start feeling good when you listen to that record! The songs on this album are all totally rocking, three of them even being written by the guys themselves. The best song, in in my opinion, is ""What Christmas Means To Me"", it just makes you want to start decorating the house . . . Awesome!"
5,Christmas Classics in Hanson Style!,Many people that redo christmas songs do them almost identicaql to the original. The always evolving Hanson brothers place their own rock touch on several of our favorite tracks. Also included are songs which they have written that have the making of christmas classics of their own. This is a definetly great album for any fan of not only Hanson but christmas as well!
4,Hanson Rock the House.....even if they are Snowed In,"For all those who may feel like the Grinch when they don't listen to Christmas music at Christmas STOP and buy this album. Hanson remakes many rock Christmas favorites and adds to them which greatly improves the sound. All three guys compliment each other from the fabulous guitar solo in Run Rudolph Run, Taylor's organ and voice making an improved version of Christmas (Baby Please Come Home, and Zac's beating the drums out while belting out Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree you can see how these guyz landed a record deal and fans. Even though this a one season album it is worth the money especially for people who like to rock for the holidays"
5,Really Cool Christmas CD,"This CD is really cool! Even though they only wrote about two songs on it, it still rocks! And you can listen to it year round (like I do!) They put new twists on the songs, and the last song they sing a capella. It's awesome!"
3,Just ok,"Honestly, I am not a huge fan of the CD. While there is no denying that these three are very talented, I felt like most every song on this CD sounded the same.The exceptions were the last two songs, ""Silent Night Medley,"" and ""White Christmas,"" which I thought were well done and sounded great.Unless you are a big Hanson fan, I would skip this one."
5,YOU'LL LOVE THIS WONDERFUL CD !,"Hanson's CD, Snowed In, is a wonderful CD to play at holiday parties. I had so many people ask who the CD was by, and tell me how wonderful it was. They were stunned when I told them it was Hanson! I personally reccomend this CD For Holiday parties and for that time when you're decorating your christmas tree. I can gaurentee you will enjoy it. Its worth buying!"
5,I love those three!,"This is the cutest Christmas CD out there. It has a bunch of adorable songs that can really make you laugh. You can't help but sing along when you hear Taylor's wonderful voice singing about how fat Santa Claus is. Oh, and then when the harmonize in White Christmas, you begin to realize how extremely talented these guys actually are. If you didn't buy this album last Christmas, you have to buy it for this one. It makes the holiday season so much more enjoyable."
2,Christmas CD didn't get her until January :(,I ordered this CD on December 4 thinking I would get it in time for Christmas but it didn't arrive until January 8! When I got the CD it had a large smudge on the back. I had to clean the CD really well for it to even play.
5,One of the best Christmas CDs ever!,"First, MMMBop. Then Where's the Love. Now Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree?These outstanding brothers from Tulsa have everything-money, a double-platinum almum (Midlle of Nowhere), AND a Christmas CD! These catchy oldies and origanal songs written by the trio will make you want to play the songs over and over while you look at the decorations on your Christmas Tree on Christmas Eve. Just don't leave it out, Santa might take it!"
3,Great for NINERS Fans! Not WIDESCREEN?,This was a great set for Niners fans looking to catch up on a little niners history. Each DVD flowed well and had some great commentary by some of the great niners. Only problems I saw was that some of the same footage was used in each of the DVD's. It only happend a couple of times but it made the DVD's seem rushed through production. My wife and I loved this set. It was like watching Rocky 1-5.Amazon says it's widescreen but my set came standard.
4,Interesting perspective,"I grew up watching the 49ers and I remember them getting creamed by the Vikings - I wasn't old enough to really know about their first 2 titles. It was very nostalgic but a bit short. One thing that I did like were some of the behind the scenes perspectives. Although I do agree with some others, I have 49er highlight tapes - the ones that are the review of the season and I'm dying to get DVD copies."
4,PERFECT CAR CD,"None of the songs bores you when driving your car. I live in Holland, a small country, but when I listen to this CD I get the feeling of freedom, I am on top of the world and driving Route 66. Thank you John !"
5,A MUST for ALL John Mellencamp Fans!,This CD captures the passion Mellencamp has for his music. A classic! Love it
4,14 tracks for the casual radio fan,"John Mellencamp / The Best That I Could Do: This single CD contains the best hits from John which makes it the best CD for the casual fan of Mellencamp. As such, it fulfills it's purpose admirably. Four Stars (4 )"
4,"Good Overview, but missing key tracks","This is fine for the casual fan. You'll never know anything is missing. For the rest of us, the omission of ""Rain On The Scarecrow"" (for instance) is unforgivable.For a much more thorough examination of this man's career (from the 70's thru present day) pick up ""Words & Music"" before it goes out of print (it's a limited edition)."
3,"The Close Count with Horseshoes, Hand Grenades & Hit Hustles","A standard/predictable attempt by label advisors getting Mellencamp's premier material from his first (and foremost) recording decade onto disc. Since not enough of his best songs were included, as many previous reviewers already have stated, discerning fan/customers unanimously agree they weren't offered all the important songs they had expected...For the sake of dedicated listeners, these songs do nothing but again wonder now how to make do with past studio album/CD's. From this so-called `American Fool`, these track-tracers provide fans only with musical mementos and him yet another lucrative townhouse for his prevailing retirement painting pastime..."
5,Greatest hits the way it was meant to be.,"Big-time fans will complain as big-time fans always do about this missing song or that missing song, but it is hard to argue with this disc's set list. Some artists suspiciously leave off hits from their earlier and usually weaker albums (are you listening ZZ Top, Mr. Springsteen?), in order to insure future sales. Hats off to you Mr. Mellencamp for not going that route. It's all here, folks. From ""I Need a Lover"" to a great new track ""Without Expression"". Now, of course there are a few great tracks that are missing, but for a no-nonsense listen to the radio success of Mellencamp, this is a wonderful collection."
4,Very good and full of hits !,"A good cd to remember those sweet 80's and the hot summer night when I was a teenager. John Mellencamp was a hit machine and this ""best of"" contains his most known songs. If you are a casual fan like me, this album is made for you."
4,"If youre a true fan, you'll be wishing this was a 2 disk set","I agree with most reviews that this is a good cd. BUt I think it will please mostly those that are aware of his radio hits. Not to say that the collection is not good, but with only one cd, you cannot cover the talent of JM appropriately. I myself rock out to this, especially in the car. However, it really makes me want to take out the full albums and lisen to them in their entirety."
4,Only #1,"This CD contains his only number 1, and for ggod measure, Jack and Diane is a very good song."
4,Solid Collection,"Like the artist himself, this CD of greatest hits is solid and reliable, and radio friendly. Does this make for bad music? Not always and definitely not in this case. Mellencamp himself doesn't think of himself as a musical genius, and this is part of his charm. He knows his place in the order of the universe and his humility shows on his songs, in a good way. They are simple and straight forward. Most of the tracks on here rock, which is more than a lot of other more pretentious types can account for."
4,The most predictable I could do,"Having been born and raised in THE small town that John was from, I realize he had to put all the commercial favorites out. But what really makes John an icon for me is how accurately his early work describes growing up in a small midwest town like no other has ever done. Let's face it, getting laid in the back of your parents car and chugging a few beers with your other 16 year-old friends on Friday night down on the river; That was it. Life there was raunchy, fun, and honest and so were 'Tonight' and others from John's early years. Plus WHERE is Key West Intermezzo??"
3,How can you go wrong?,"It's hard not to like this collection, since just about every track here is still in regular rotation on many radio stations. That's also unfortunate, though, because there are few pleasant surprises that a casual Mellencamp fan will stumble onto. One exception is the final track, ""Without Expression"", which is a cover that Mellencamp manages to sound like he wrote himself."
5,Book Review - Skin Deep,Excellent book. It allowed me to acknowledge that I have many ways to hide the experience of feeling my feelings -- and I am not unique and alone in my suffering. Most importantly there is viable scientific research to support the road to recovery.
5,The most over-looked pop singer/songwriter of the 90s,"Tho he veered off track slightly once signing to a major label--this full length is Matt at his peak. Most obvious comparison to someone recording today would be Jason Falkner or perhaps Freedy. Insightful lyrics and massive melancholy hooks make this release (and his first full CD ""Tell it to yourself"" some of the best contemprorary male singer songwriter releases ever."
3,Good semi-technical work,"This commentary is not as deep going as Bauckhams, but that is not the aim of the series either. This is a good commentary for the average reader who does not know greek. It is very readable and Kelly argues his case in a pleasant way. Another (and perhaps better)commentary in the same league would be Greens in the Tyndale series, who also assumes Petrine authorship, which Kelly does not."
2,Disappointing,"The late Dr. Kelly is one of my all time favorite authors in the field of Church History (_Dictionary of Popes_, _Golden Mouth_, _Jerome_), but this foray into Biblical Studies, is quite disappointing. Dr. Kelly merely retreads tired interpretations of what are three of the most overlooked but most interesting of the New Testament epistles. The inclusion of 1 Peter with 2 Peter & Jude is highly dubious as well. For really interesting writing on Jude & 2 Peter, I would suggest E. Earle Ellis' or Richard Bauckham's work. There are many excellent commentaries on 1 Peter, too many to list. I guess even brilliant authors have their off days."
4,Great historically fiction,"Do not overlook this collection. Unlike the Conan or Kull stories there are no fantasy elements in these stories. The settings are very historically accurate. Most of the main characters have some deep flaw or weakness from pride, to anger, to alcoholism, to lack of faith in anything. They war in torn and broken lands but somehow REH allows a glimmer of greatness /hope/ good luck to touch them or their world. Alot of times that is not the case. Worth the time to read just for the entries ""The Lion of Tiberias"", and ""the Sowers of Thunder"". ""The Road of Azrael"" stands with ""Beyond the Black River"" and ""By This Ax I Rule"" as REH at his best. Yes, there are some weaker inclusions aka ""The Road of the Eagles"" and ""Gates of Empire"". Also unlike the Del Rey editions there is NO ART WORK. All REH and historical fiction fans need to read this collection."
3,Ponderous and generally pedestrian,"Stahr argues that Jay is an often forgotten founding father, but that Jay is as important as those who are more commonly mentioned among the pantheon of American revolutionary leaders. Jay’s contributions to the revolution and founding of the United States are well documented by Stahr. The man comes through as an intelligent, assiduous, honest, but often difficult patriot; but not someone who is very inspiring or who would be pleasant to be around. I found the book to be ponderous and the reading generally pedestrian. Too often insignificant details sidetrack the story of Jay’s life. This is not a book for those who enjoy absorbing and rousing history. Be prepared to push your way through Jay’s life."
4,walter Stahr's John Jay,I was impressed with the historical value of this book.The discussion of the Jay treaty is clear and is a finecontribution to this seldom explained document.
5,John Jay is a good book,I enjoyed reading about John Jay. I remembered his treaty as being far more unpopular than in the book. Overall the book is an excellent and detailed account of Jhn Jay's life. I would highly recommend it.
2,Not what it appears to be...,"When I began searching for a ""how to build an AR15"" book this wasn't what I had in mind.This book is written for people who want to build an AR15 and get around the government doing it. They give you step by step directions on how to build it from parts that aren't even complete. For example, there are many in depth pages dedicated to what parts of the lower reciever need to be filed down and drilled.You can find step by step directions to building your own lower reciever on AR15.com. It has good knowledge of the laws regarding the AR15, but this book was written during the ban. So many of these laws are obsolete.My advice is to look elsewhere for instructions on the AR15 and it's various offspring."
4,Good book,"For those that want to look into manufacturing their own AR lower receiver, this is the place to start. Check with your state and local laws regarding the manufacturer of receivers."
2,Incomplete Guide,"The Information is OK, but a little outdated, only addresses the finishing of the Lower Reciever, not information on where and how to complete an upper reciever."
1,the workbench ar-15 project,Since i have yet to reciev e this book i can't give anything but a negative review of the entire process. If and when this book arrives I might review it.
3,Not the book I thought it would be.,"This book tells you how to build an AR-15 from an 80% finished lower. A perfectly legal way (at least today) to build your own AR platform. If you are looking for a book that tells you how to assemble a complete AR-15 from a stripped lower, then try a different book. If you are interested in the machine work, etc. necessary to finish and build your own rifle, then this book is for you."
3,have a mill?,You aren't really going to build anything with this book. This is for the avid reader or the skilled machinist.
3,It's Ok..,"I bought this book for the 80% idea, but now after doing much more research and building my own 80% lower, I only use the book for parts breakdown and ID now.. Don't buy the book if you are looking to build your own 80% lower, there are much easier ways of doing it now!"
3,AR-15,Older publication. Has some good information. Easy to follow and has some nice pictures describing the differences between auto and semi auto.
3,Nice job,"Quality work and craftsmanship. You inspire me! I would love to watch you build one of these. A few times during the reading of it, I could feel the tension of digging out metal and not cracking the part. I felt like I could do it but, do I want to invest the energy and resources? You gave me a lot to think about, pro's and con's. Thank you."
1,The Workbench AR-15I,"Buyer Beware! Read the title Carefully!This is not about building an AR that most people are interested in. This is about building and AR, from an incomplete lower, which is attainable without going thru required paperwork.Most people want to build an AR from scratch so they can repair if needed. This is not your book!"
3,"Nice book, but sadly irrelevant...","The instructions in this book are clear and would be very useful for someone with reasonable experience and a few basic tools. Unfortunately, this book is designed to help you complete an 80% receiver, and these are no longer available. Get one of the books or videos relating to 0% forgings instead, if you are serious about this project."
4,Thorough History,"This is a good book to read if you want to know more about how the Wheaten came to be, tracing its history and breeding from Ireland to the US. It also offers some great information on grooming and showing the breed. It's a lovely book which includes some very nice color photographs, written by a woman who definitely knows what she's talking about!"
2,The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier,It's very nice & informative BUT most of the pictures are Black & White...All Colored pictures would've been Better! Out of the 177 pages it had Only 8 (in the middle) were colored.
2,"A ""Show"" Dog owner's book","Nice book, with a few nice photos and some good advice but most of the book was devoted to those interested in pedigrees and showing. We just got our third Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier puppy. Our first was ""pet quality"" back in 1982 and he was a wonderful family dog. Our second is still with us at 13 1/2, deaf, and definitely retired and this new puppy is also a ""companion"" and not a show dog. So, a nice book for our book shelves but not one I will refer to or browse through."
4,Motor city madman!!,"Early Ted just as crazy as the later Ted! Bought the CD also bought his DVD, both outstanding! Great entertainment by far..."
3,"performance is there, but the sound suffers","I always love Ted, especially live. Big positive: This is yet another opportunity to hear Ted live and crazy. Big negative: Vocals and Ted's guitar way up in the mix; bass guitar and drums very low in the mix; missing a lot of low frequencies as this show was recorded. You will be happy with Uncle Ted in the mix, and unhappy with the rest of the mix. Some reviewers are critical of the other band members' performances on this recording; however, I believe it's not that they are not putting on a good show - it's just that you cannot hear them in the mix. Good cd for absolute Ted enthusiasts or for folks who don't care whether the mix is bad."
4,What a Day it Was!,"This charming movie is full of surprises. It takes place in one day in the life of a young singer/musician, who works at a sandwich shop. A young man, runs into her after she has a very traumatic experience, recognizes her from the sandwich shop, and tries to help. They spend the day together as he treats her to anything her heart desires."
4,Knowing what to expect makes the unknown easier to approach.,"For many women, the time period after giving birth is an unknown -- How will they feel? Is there any pain involved? What can I expect? Even though each pregnancy and after birth experience is different, if a woman has never given birth before, she is much in the dark about what she can actually expect.The book ""The Post-Pregnancy Handbook,"" by Sylvia Brown, explains in detail what new mothers can expect to feel after giving birth. It discusses recovery and any problems you might experience; caring for and getting your body back after you get home; breastfeeding; relationship issues; sex; and exercise.MyParenTime.com recommends this book -- it answers many questions that women might be afraid to ask their doctors, and aims to reassure women that they can recover from pregnancy...physically, emotionally, and sexually. If women know what to expect after childbirth, they will be more equipped to deal with post-pregnancy experiences."
1,PUTS HORROR INTO YOUR PREGNANCY,"This book lists & describes everything in detail all the possibilities that can go wrong in every stage of pregnancy, labor, & childbirth. I skimmed through most of the book because I wanted to be educated, not mortified! It had a few tips that I highlighted but I honestly couldn't even tell you what they are besides obviously not that important or impressive.I should have known a book written by a woman in response to her 'frustration' would NOT be a good book for a pregnant mama to read or any woman really!"
4,book review,It looked good with a quick glance. I bought it as a gift and didn't read much of it myself. Looked good though.
4,Triping Back Into The Broken Days,"It's realy strange...Matt Skiba with Heavens show off the fact that the bad album with good promotion is capable of some selling degree. In the other hand; left side of Alkaline Trio shines with the Falcon but no real recogniation at all. Forget the buzz, basic creation core purely down the the lure of Kelly (Lawrence Arms). You can feel his ambition on the song like 'The Routes We Wander and Blackout. It's full heart street punk over Andriano's first love ""Tuesday"". Not complete as early ""Trio"" but far mature than ""Slapstick"".Best Track: When I Give The Signal, Run!"
5,Just perfect,"I had three different garlic presses through my life and I gave them up willingly and easily - all of them were smashing FRESH garlic and were hard to clean, so I ended living without garlic press and just dicing the clove. Now I decided to try one more time and I am happier, than ever - this guy SQUEEZES almost without any residue even if garlic cloves not very hard; and what is left is very easy to clean. Takes three medium size cloves at ones. Works easily.BRAVO!"
4,Great Garlic Press,"I would give this a 5 star rating if it was not for the smaller than average garlic clove basket (if you will). I have used others that are not as simple to clean nor as beautifully designed, but the smaller press capacity takes one star out."
5,Best garlic press I've ever used,"Many of the other reviews go into great detail if you're interested in the particulars, but as a picky engineer and foodie, I can say that this is really simple to clean and delightful to use. It impresses me every time, and we've had it a few months."
5,Best Garlic press I've ever used,"Everything about this press - the build quality, the levering action that makes it easier to crush garlic (even with the skin on!) I love.When I'm crushing a bunch of garlic, I peel all the pieces except for the last one. This way, I don't have to clean out the press after each crush, and the skin on one at the end makes it easier to clean out because the skin sort of ""pulls out"" the garlic bits. Also, being able to leave the skin on is great for all those tiny little cloves of garlic in the middle of the bulb that are a pain to peel."
3,It would be a good tripod if..,"the pan/tilt lever didn't break off after only a few uses. They wouldn't return it because I didn't have the recipt. I noticed another one in store that had the same off-center problem my lever had. Looks like it was a common problem...I do however still use the tripod, I just have to turn that knob with my leatherman, and frankly, I like the tripod..."
3,"Stable and heavy tripod, but tilt lever not sturdy enough","I have owned this tripod for 3 years.Pros :- heavy. This causes it to be very stable- looks really good- very high at 73""- doubles as a monopod- bubble level is nice to have- tripod head is removable- the legs are strong and well builtCons :- heavy ! At 6 lbs, this is really not one that you can carry for too long. When traveling, I do not take it with me, given the current rates airlines are charging for luggage- like many other reviewers, the tilt level broke on me. First, it bent during a move a year and a half ago. And more recently, it just broke, and now I can't adjust the tilt anymore. This is a real shame, because the rest of the tripod (legs) seems very solid. Unfortunately this one part is too fragile.- does not come with a case, and it really needs oneNow that the head has broken on mine, I may replace just the head as the rest of the body is still fine."
2,Solid tripod but...,"This tripod is a solid unit... except for the pan/tilt handle as all other reviewers responded. I needed to pick up a tripod on short notice and didn't read any reviews on this unit until after I returned from my trip. Clearly my loss, since my unit broke exactly the same as everyone else's. Luckily, I'm still within my return period from Wolf Camera, so hopefully they take it back. If not, I may end up being forced to deal with Quantaray directly.Stay away from this tripod. Clearly the design hasn't changed in years and Quantaray keeps selling the same defective product."
4,Just to say,"I'm not really a fan of country music, although somehow I had heard of NROTPS. The one track that really stands out from the rest is ""rainbow"" - all the rest seem fairly average. Does anyone else see this?"
5,Fresh,The line of products from Heno de Pravia continues to impress. The fresh scent has always been one of my favorites.
4,Where Are All the Letters?,"What if all the letter blocks were missing from you little block cart? Where would you look to find them? This short little book tells the story of how all the blocks disappeared, one by one, and where they were found.I found the author to be quite creative in where she found the blocks. ""B"" tumbled into the Bath. ""K"" hitched a ride in a Kangaroo pouch. ""P"" dove into the Popcorn. ""U"" turned herself Upside down. ""W"" fell into the Washing machine.At the end of the story the blocks are together again, but soon they will begin to disappear again. The author asks if you can guess where they might go, which provides the opportunity to discuss with your kids other possibilities and what letters these words begin with."
2,Disappointed,"I play acoustic guitar and wanted to expand my bluegrass. When the mandolin arrived there were pieces in the box. The metal end was off, key laying in the box and a broken string. I got that fixed, when 2 other strings broke. Also, the black piece, strumming protector fell off. I took it to the music store where they chuckled and said it was not worth fixing. I didn't want to spend tons of money, because I was not sure I would like playing; but, I have own this for 5 years and afraid to even strum it, for it might break."
4,Funny and fetching,"If you were to cross Jane Austen's Emma Woodhouse with E. F. Benson's Lucia, the result (psychologically as well as chronologically) would be Margaret Oliphant's triumphant queen of Carlingford society, Lucilla Marjoribanks. Determined to show everyone an entertaining time (ostensibly ""to be a comfort to dear Papa,"" even though her father tends to withdraw entirely from her noisy gatherings), the self-centered but always ingenious Lucilla engineers social triumph after social triumph in this very amusing mid-Victorian novel. There were many moments when I laughed out loud, or was genuinely surprised by Lucilla's cleverness in overcoming momentary catastrophes. This is the perfect book for anyone who has loved Austen, Trollope, or Elzabeth Gaskell's WIVES AND DAUGHTERS."
4,Light and fun,"I enjoyed this book much more than I expected. I came to love the character of Miss Lucilla Marjoribanks. She's a little over the top, and Oliphant has fun with Lucilla's extensive charm and ""strength of mind"". I found myself laughing as Lucilla shaped society in her town. The book is a fun and easy read...definitely recommended."
3,Fun but Tiring,"Maybe I've maxed out on 19th Century British Lit inane young women. I really looked forward to this, but was disappointed. One of the back cover comments reads ""A feminist Trollope..."" (about Oliphant) - not even close. Trollope is far, far better than this. There are some amusing parts but the characters and plot just don't live up to the hype."
2,Disappointing,"Being a Jane Austen fan, I was very excited by the prospect of a new book. Talking about disappointment. First I was disappointed that Amazon would offer this to me at the price I paid since it's thinner than a steno pad. Secondly I felt like I was left hanging. There is nothing worse than to get caught up in a story and have it end with nothing resolved. If you must read this, don't buy it, until you read it. That way if you do decide to buy, you'll know what you're getting. I gave it 2 stars because it is Jane Austen."
5,Tight quality fit,"I got 2 of these expecting to only get one splitter per box. When they arrived, I found that each box has 2 y-splitters. One for positive and one for negative. This is exactly what you need if you want to split your subwoofer signal for 2 amps or 4 channels.The connectors are very tight and do not want to let go. Thus, giving you a very good connection.They look pro too. Monster products are worth every penny. Before I changed to Monster interconnects, I was getting bad noise when, for example, the fog lights were on or the air conditioning was on high. Talk about embarrassing when you're trying to show off and its hot outside. So I quickly changed to Monster 202 and 204 LN Audio Interconnects and problem solved.Don't waste money with other products; go with Monster the first time, every time.-Keven"
2,Not great.,"This book is really poorly laid out, but I will spare the review because my guess is that if you are considering buying this book, you don't have much of a choice in the matter anyhow."
2,This book should only be used for ADVANCED learners of Italian,"As a student of Italian and user of this textbook, I feel the vocabulary used in stories, newspaper articles, and editorials featured in In Viaggio are too high-level for third and fourth semester Italian students. The glossary in the back of the book is very unhelpful because it is only in Italian and only for the vocabulary already defined for each chapter, not for the random and unfamiliar words used in the extra articles and stories which students are also responsible for. The textbook used for Italian 1 and 2 was better suited to LEARNING, not reading in Italian for pleasure, or whatever this book is intended for."
3,Leicester Bangs Review (1997):,"Matt Keating - Killjoy (Alias)Singer-songwriter Matt Keating's latest album is a fine collection of dark songs with emotional twists. The subject matter of the lyrics range from a nervous breakdown in ""The L Word"" to the extreme right wing threat in ""While We Fiddle"". In between, relationships are put under the spotlight in what seems to be a very personal way.Most of the tracks appear fairly raw, recorded on an 8-track machine in Keating's own basement. That doesn't take anything away from the album. On the contrary, it adds an earthiness that helps give gravitas and depth.All in all, a good solid record, and if you like the idea of someone who could be the missing link between Leonard Cohen and Paul Westerberg, it might just be the record for you."
4,One of the best Canadian films ever made,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Mon Oncle Antoine is a film that has been regarded as the best Canadian film of all time. I can say it is one of the best I have seen also.The film is directed by Claude Jutra and is about a teenage boy living in an asbestos mining town in rural Quebec during Christmas in the 1940's. He works for his uncle who is the town mortician. The film has great cimenatography and has some great scenes of the town.The DVD has some good special features also on this double disc set.Disc one contains the film with both the original French language track and an optional English dub, plus the theatrical trailer.Disc two contains a 2007 documentary on the film's production, a 2002 biography of Claude Jutra, and ""A Chairy Tale"" a 1957 short film that Jutra co-directed with Norman McLaren. (This film is about a chair the moves around to avoid being sit on.)This film is very good and I highly recommend it."
2,Doesn't live up to reviews.,"After reading the other reviews, I was prepared for a heart-warming, coming of age movie. What I got was dark, slow, hard to follow and boring. The movie I bought from Amazon was a prior rental in the U.S., so maybe something was cut out of it that made it such a classic, but from what I saw it was just 90 minutes worth of ""stuff"". There was no real ""coming of age"" event in the whole movie. He did wrestle with a girl about his own age for a minute or so, but no emotions, or ""sexual awakening"" was ever revealed."
5,Magique !,"Un film totalement magique, pour apprendre à aimer un peu plus la France des Amériques !"
1,Don't buy this book!,"Sure this book has a pretty cover, and the information is great, but after studying this book for my graduate-level course in ""Introduction to Psychotherapy,"" I would highly suggest reading another text. It's a highly technical text that while it has good ideas and simple case studies to illustrate its points, I highly recommned Gerald Corey's books on individual counseling because they're easier to read and he makes learning much more enjoyable!"
1,"I'm sorry, but I thought this book","Was God awful! I read Retsis when it first came out and because I am an avid reader and rarely meet a book that I don't like, I decided to give it another shot...big mistake and headache on my part. I just found that it lacked creativity and cleverness. I bought the book and was determined to finish it to the end in hopes that it would get better but...legnA? retsiS? Come on! Needless to say, I was very disappointed then as I am now. Just awful...P.S. I will give Ms Davis an E for effort for exploring outside the norm and trying something different. The fact that it wasn't about a man doing the main woman character wrong or neighborhoods destroyed by drugs and gangs says that she has some sort of imagination. If she could turn it into something half way enjoyable she'd become an exceptional author...maybe."
1,WHAT the DEVIL?,"I agree with you, I have no idea who the four people are who gave it such rave reviews. Please don't waste your time reading this book! if you got it as a gift GIVE IT BACK because THIS book is not good enough to set your drink on. JUST SO MAD!!!"
4,A Lounge Act ...,"Lounge-y blues and a good mix of ""she done me wrong"" songs that will bring you back to when the 33 1/3 LP was spinning on the old phonograph. Grab a Tom Collins, slip on your chenille socks, take the easy chair and relax and remember that old flame."
5,Comfort yes,"I can wear this headset for hours and it does not bother me, also the sound quality is great as well as the price.Why get expensive when you can have it all with this very nice set"
2,Not satisfied.,"I don't feel satisfied because the material is not as espected.I hurt my hand using crutches and I was trying to find something soft, but the material is the same that I already have in my crutches."
2,The bad with the good,"How can a collection featuring Yma Sumac, Townes Van Zandt, Nina Simone and Moondog get only 2 stars, because of Kenny Rogers & the 1st Edition. This version of the song sucks, and the scene in the movie sucked. Edit this self indulgant dreck out of both and they rate higher."
4,Where is the Creedence?,"I haven't heard the album as a whole yet, but I'm an addict on the film. And what I'm wondering is - where is the Creedence, man? CCR defines this flick. Where in hell is ""Lookin' Out My Backdoor?"" Just thinking of The Dude pounding on his roof of his car, with joint and beer in hand has me rolling! And it's because of the Creedence!"
2,Disappointed,"The Big Lebowski CD was a big disappointment. I should have looked more closely, and listened to the whole thing before I bought. There are only 3 or 4 good tracks, and Shawn Colvin's (?) cover of ""Viva Las Vegas"" isn't even on there. On the other hand, the Spanish language version of ""Hotel California"" almost makes up for it. Download the tracks you like and forget about the CD."
2,Incomplete,"I'm still waiting for the COMPLETE ""Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"". This agression will not stand, man..."
4,Eclectic Mix from Big Lebowski,I was impressed by the range and mix of music in the Big Lebowski soundtrack. I have found myself drawn more and more to soundtrack albums versus single-artist albums in the last few years. This one is a keeper.
2,Best Tracks Are Missing- Please Issue Vol II,"Tumbling Tumbleweeds is practically the theme song of the Big Lebowski, yet it didn't even make the soundtrack. Mozart's Requiem? Dead and buried on the cutting room floor with several other great tracks. Creedence? Out the backdoor. I wanted to like the album as much as the movie, but so many tracks are missing. Maybe I just liked the movie too much, perhaps there will be a Lebowski II to fill in the gargantuan gaps?"
4,missing essential tracks,"I can overlook the omission of 'the Creedence' and the Eagles (I hate the f@ckin' Eagles, man). However, this soundtrack cannot be considered complete without ""Venice Beach League Playoffs 1987"" or some classic Autobahn."
3,Missing Key Songs,"When I first saw the movie and heard the music I fell in love with the songs. But when I went here to see the track listing I noticed my favorite songs were missing. For example ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds""-the title song isnt on here? As well as Santana's ""Oye Como Va"" and CCR's songs. What happened here too many legal isssues? I would have given it 2 more stars at least if ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" was on here.Too bad."
1,Music missing,"This cd does not have any of the John Fogerty music, or any of the really good songs. So, buy at your own risk."
3,OK but expecting more,I was disappointed it did not include alot of the music that was on the movie like viva las vegas
3,Worth it just for The Gypsy Kings,"as others have pointed out, this album is not true to the movie since it does not include the Credence tracks, but it is worth buying just for the Gypsy Kings cover of Hotel California. I listened to it on a visit to LA last week as I drove down Florence Avenue near Pacific looking for Tommy's Burgers. Double chili Cheese, please!"
3,Not bad... but missing something.,"This cd definitely has some good points. A great song by Dylan from the opening credits and my favourite, ""Dead Flowers"" done by Townes Van Zandt. But tremendously written by Jagger and Richards. Funny how my faves are from the start and end of the film. Between these two songs and a rousing ""Hotel California"" by the Gypsy Kings, I'm happy enough, but oddly, no Creedance. What am I gonna listen to while reaching for that joint I dropped in my lap in the car?"
3,What about the creenence?,"I just wonder who mixed this CD. The dude was better off losing the briefcase and getting the Creedence tapes back. Aside from that where are the ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" and the Eagles? It's all about priorities man. I also would have kinda liked to hear the song ot the whales but maybe that's asking to much."
3,"Dear Ethan and Joel Coen,","Thank you for a movie that has changed my life.Having just watched the movie for the 20 something time, I have come to the realization, the sound track is a mere shadow of the original score. 'Your in a world of pain', John Goodman's speech in the bowling alley as he threaten Smoky with his life, is hung against a backdrop of and unknown song. 'The song really tied the scene together man...'I am resigned to buy DVD player JUST to read the music credits. Yes, the CCR may be in Forgarty's legal battles, but, Ethan and Joel, please in future movies, use a disclaimer the soundtrack is a mere shadow or the original. The selection of music to this movie was nothing short of brillant."
3,Big Lebowski soundtrack missing much.,"The Big Lebowski Soundtrack was missing several songs that were in the movie but more importantly it was missing the ending credits song that was my favorite version of Viva Las Vegas I have ever heard, performed by Shaun Colvin. I had to get this song off line and others that I found that were missing from the movie and create my own CD. Only other CD that has the Viva Las Vegas by Shaun Colvin is the Tribute to Doc Pomus CD. Hopefully someday the owners of the movie will release a more accurate and complete CD soundtrack for the fans."
5,The Big Lebowski Soundtrack Makes Beautiful Music,"I just recently watched The Big Lebowski iconic film by the Coen Brothers and not only loved the movie but was blown away by the eclectic and brilliant soundtrack. Over the years, I became aware that the film and Jeff Bridges character has created a cult following and I was clueless regarding the soundtrack. There are more than a few gems on this album: Captain Beefheart-Her Eyes Are A Blue Million Miles, Nina Simone-I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good, Henry Mancini-Lujon, The Gipsy Kings spanish language rendition of Hotel California (goosebumps)...just too name a few. I purchased this album on Amazon.com. (Excellent service and prices)."
3,"Never mind Creedence, where are the Monks?","When I saw the movie I was excited because I heard the song ""I Hate You"" by the legendary 60's garage-punk group, The Monks, playing in the background at the bowling alley. Lo and behold, it didn't make the soundtrack. The Monks will get their due one day. You probably never heard of them, but I hear Danny DeVito has bought the rights to their biography, and wants to make a movie out of it. Hopefully it will happen, and then everybody will know who they are."
1,"The Dude says ""Bummer, man"".","Apparently ""soundtrack"" means ""at least half of the music"". At 14 of 27 cited in the movie credits, this CD squeezes by. Too bad the Creedence, the Shawn Colvin, the Townes Van Zandt, and other defining musical moments didn't make it onto the CD, in which the hand of the Coens is notably absent. They must be already spinning in their future graves over this piece of studio garbage. Like exploding fuel tanks and failing brakes, this one deserves a corporate recall and reissue."
2,"This is why ""Ripping"" programs and CD burners were invented.","This CD has 3 really good tracks. ""The man in me"" by Bob Dylan, ""Just Dropped In (to see what condition my condition was in)"" by Kenny Rogers, and a very cool cover of ""Hotel California"" by the Gypsy Kings. Unfortunately, the remaining 11 tracks bite. In my opinion, definately NOT worth the money. Your'e better off finding someone that has the CD and ripping the 3 tracks I mentioned."
2,No Esquivel either,"All these reviews by wanna-be hipsters, and not one - ONE - of you noticed the most OBVIOUS omission in the album. Mucha Muchacha from Esquivel. One of (the many) best scenes in the film, poolside with Bunny and the nihilist - ""I'm just going to go find a cash machine"" - uses that song.I guess Esquivel's estate must be hella expensive for these low-rent bozos.I DID NOT WATCH MY BUDDIES DIE FACE DOWN IN THE MUCK IN NAM SO THIS COMPANY COULD PASS OFF..."
4,"c'mon dude, let's go bowling","having read these other fine reviews by fellow fans of this excellent coen brothers film, i have to say i agree with many when i voice my disappointment at the exclusion of creedence's very dude-like ""lookin' out my back door"". though not so much of a problem for myself, being an owner of a copy of ""cosmo's factory"", i feel that many buyers may feel disheartened to learn of it's absence on the album. this however, is no reason at all not to go out there and buy the damn thing! from the trippy kenny rogers track to the soothing tones of dylan, and even the excellent gipsy king's take on the eagle's classic Hotel...this is a winning choice. chuck this on the hi fi and watch people's heads turn. if you've seen the film, then this album serves as great reminder of those hilarious and moving moments of bizarre adventure that the dude and his ""jewish"" 'nam veteran buddy walter embark upon...."
2,bomber dude,"ya their are some good songs on this disc but most of which is missing. Its all meat and potatos with no juice... for the three that your buying this for, then cool. You may like it. I was disappointed that I had to buy 6 other discs to get all the songs."
2,Would not be enough to tie the movie together,"There are some definite nuggets here, such as ""Condition"" and ""Hotel California,"" but there are also some VERY noticeable omissions, such as ""Tumbleweeds"" and CCR. Also, some of the stuff on this album is a complete mystery to me. I'm listening to it right now, and I can't remember for all the Kahlua in Mexico where some of these songs were in the film. It would be nice to see an improved, 10th anniversary edition of the CD to go with the DVD, but things don't look promising. I guess the licensing was too difficult for some tracks. Basically, I'm glad I got this on ebay."
3,Buy only if you like the movie.,The soundtrack is eclectic to say the least. Covers many genres and is a curiousity item that reminds me of the hilarious movie. Don't buy it unless you love the movie.
1,No goods,"one month later, I still haven't received what I ordered. I usually receive my orders from amazon sellers in a timely manner. Contacted the seller and no reply. I really need this product, too."
1,Not worth the postage,"This book is amazing. It takes some very interesting ideas about cryonics and whips them up with poor characters and shallow conversation to come out to a rather poor novel. I'd hoped for more, but instead I found the main character to be someone so far from a person I could identify with that I almost cheered at the obstacles set in her way. I haven't read other Nagata works, but I hope that they are better than this."
2,Poorly written,"I was hoping this book would feature a character who was fat and comfortable with herself but I found the main character to be fat and sometimes uncomfortable with herself, which wasn't very inspiring. Also, the writing quality is just ok, almost but not quite as good as Stephanie Meyer's writing, author of the Twilight Saga. Certainly nothing spectacular. I got about three quarters of the way through the book and then just somehow never finished reading it, I suppose because I was never that hooked by it. That's not a good sign."
4,A 40-something female doctor living fully!,An Abundant Woman was available free at my local Curves. Elizabeth Walker's novel turned out to be a great gift. I became captivated by the unexpected unfolding of Amanda's insights as she continued to actualize her potential professionally and personally.
5,Portrait of Phil Lynott,"This is an excellent but brief (58 min.) portrait of Phil Lynott that shows the ups and downs of The Rocker. There are some rare footage of Phil growing up that talks about his childhood & early days prior to Lizzy.What's interesting is they have footage of Phil talking about Thin Lizzy. You have interviews with Phil's mother, Philomena, his wife Caroline and Thin Lizzy members Brian Downey, Scott Gorham, Brian Robertson, Eric Bell and Gary Moore. Thin Lizzy managers Chris Morrison and Chris O'Donnell. I think the interesting interviews was from the band mates who toured & played w/ him.Some other guests interviews include Bono, Bob Geldof, Huey Lewis, Van Morrison, etc...I notice some of the interviews are what was written in the Thin Lizzy `Vagabonds, Kings, Warriors, Angels' 4CD Box Set.They do play some songs but not in it's entirety. It's sad he left us at an early time. Rest In Peace, Phil."
4,Good for fans of the series,"If you like I Spy then get this DVD. It has the only two part episode (To Florence With Love) and a good spy episode with Bridge of Spies. The best of the lot, on this DVD, is A Gift From Alexander. It's an engaging, humorous tale with good plot and twists. In the end, Robinson and Scott get decorated by the USSR. A hoot, considering this was filmed/aired during the mid-60s. The color and quality of the episodes are good. But there are no extras that many DVDs now-a-days have. It has chapter selections that are basically the same places where the comercials would have went. Still, if you are an I Spy fan, or spy show fan, this is a good one."
1,Overcharged with ideology,"The good thing about the book is that it is very well written and in a clear fashion. This renders such a diffucult topic understandable.But the content is completely ideological and does not present the facts. It blames the corruption in arab's leadership for the suffering of the palestinians, but suggests this corrpution exists and was encouraged as a reaction to european orientalsm and zionist ""occupation"".So at first the book starts with somewhat of a critic to arab leadership, but ends up suggesting zionism and related ideologies as ""sources of arab corrpution"".This point is not new. It rather the norm in Edward Said's works. And the people who know the goodwill of jews know that the point he tries to make falls by its own contradictions."
4,Reference source with a twist,"Although, I would recommend viewing this text as a reference source, it is so enjoyably written that anyone interested in air warfare will find it a valuable addition to their library. ""WWII Aviation Booklist"" http://www.ampsc.com/~prophet/booklist.htm"
3,Very good but not cream of the crop,This book is very well written with immense detail given. This book will give you the history of Britain all the way back to WWI through the end of WWII. If you are looking for a book which is written through the eyes of just one man then this may not be the book for you. This book is more written as a narrative as you would see on a Discovery Channel program. But let me say that it is quite thorough in its representation of information.
4,Compelling Account from the British Side,"A very readable, if not entirely objective, account of the Battle. An intriguing review of British inter-war preparations is followed by a so-so description of the action."
2,What a waste...,"The plot starts of very well. As an Indian, I really enjoyed a lot of the initial background (even though some part was 'imaginative'). But sooner than you know, the plot runs into nonsense. Tom Clancy is famous for accuracy of info - too bad he did not write this one. An example - the terrorists find that the shortest path from Srinagar to Pakistan is via Siachen - what a crock. ...! On top of this, the back cover is misleading - the story is NOT what it says on the cover - quite crazy really.Indicates pathetic editing and publishing values. I was glad I had not paid for the book - only borrowed it.The action is unbelievable - literally. I wish someone else would pick up the idea and write a better book. And I hope the author would take ONE look at the map of Kashmir (I doubt if he could visit Siachen - so the faked description of the glacier and its dubious use in the plot is excused)."
1,Series standards are slipping,"This book was really sloppy. It has everything from major factual blunders (they drive on the left in India and Pakistan) to technological ignorance (it doesn't take 50 minutes to fall 10,000 feet) to just plain bad writing, all over the place.Save your time and money."
2,Bad and Getting Worse!,"Another bad book with Tom Clancy's name on it. That is startingto be the norm these days. Striker is supposed to capture a radical cleric who is creating problems between India and Pakistan. The story never gets off the ground. The plot is awful.The action is actually ho hum. The characters even fall short.But remember,that is the style with Tom Clancy books these days.A very dissapointing book. I sincerely think that Tom Clancyshould fire his ghostwriter."
1,Totally ridiculous,"This book is a piece of junk. The author has detailed information about the war planes, CIA etc etc. But sadly, he does not have a clue about the real conflict in Kashmir. The whole plot is just laughable."
1,Juvenile,"I read a LOT, and was running to the airplane with out a book, so I picked this up near the gate. Oh my. Be warned. This is written for 14-year old boys. Cornball salutes, deep thoughts about friends, country, fellow warriors blah yada pablum. The cover should have been enough warning.I can't believe something like this gets published. This 'inspired by' racket is really something. It's pulp publishing for the 21st Century."
1,Line of Control is DOA,"Sloppy, formulaic writing laced with facts and factoids like a term paper. The characters are so wooden and one-dimensional that the book is almost unreadable. If you should happen to take it to the beach, slather on plenty of sunblock before you turn the first page. This ""thriller"" may put you to sleep."
2,"Exiting to read, but story does not make sense","The format the book is written is excellent. The story does not make any sense. I was very disaponted to reach the end of the book and find out that all the trouble that they went through, could have been resolved by just making a call."
4,Beautiful Ice Bucket,"This ice bucket is very beautiful and is being sold at a very good price. My only disappointment/surprise is the lid. I thought it was made of metal like the rings around the top and bottom of the bucket. Instead it is made of frosted plastic and arrived with multiple scratches on the inside of the lid. Since the scratches aren't very noticeable from the outside, we decided to keep this one. It's unlikely that other lids will arrive in the same condition, so I do highly recommend this bucket to others. It is definitely the most beautiful for the money."
2,Ice Bucket,I ordered 3 ice buckets and one lid was missing. It was more trouble to send back the ice bucket than it was worth.
2,Gainiing Lightness,"I must say I was disappointed that I did not get the product I ordered (somehow it was mixed up with another book, not even close to the topic). With that said, I will say that the company selling it did everything they could under the circumstances. So, I am not sure how this happened, or why, I did not get the correct book but I am satisfied that I did not have to pay for someone else's mistake."
3,"Intellectually stimulating, but viscerally unsatisfying","This final novel of Samuel R. Delany's trilogy about mankind facing a potential enemy from another galaxy is better than the previous two novels. Delany grew enormously as a writer over the course of this series, producing prose that is frequently poetic. The Lord of the Flames is a truly fascinating alien being. His book, however, becomes unfocused and loses dramatic tension as he becomes more interested in concluding his big statements on the nature of Man without attending adequately to the nuts and bolts of anchoring them in a compelling narrative with a satisfying climax."
5,Geisha Pillow,"This pillow is a perfect size for the bed, beautifully made and just stands out as a quality looking item."
4,A Pretty Balanced Collection,"There's not much I can say about this compilation, save for the fact that it's a nice, solid gathering of all the hits and key tracks that the group is well known for. However, one could only guess why the heck they had to put Boys and Girls on the LP. It sort of ruined the whole flow of the CD and I almost always have to skip over it. They should've put a vintage TTT track like Born Not To Know or Slow Wine in its place instead.Still, it's a good album to snatch up if you're a fan of soul music with an innovative twist, or of TTT in general."
2,"tony, toni, tone ""Few Hits""","This CD has a few of Tony, Toni, Tone hits but falls short of a ""Hits CD"". It should be names ""A Few Hits"". They have mostly ""filler songs"" on here, tracks that received little or no airplay. I was disappointed with this CD. On a scale of 1-10, I rate this CD a 6 at best."
3,only purchased for one song,"I got what I wanted. Only purchased for one of my favorite songs, Anniversay! that I could find in stores."
5,Pure Excitement!,Now this is an album I can listen to straight through!!! I was so excited to recieve it!!! I have always been a major fan of Tony! Toni! Tone! This album is filled with all the songs that everyone enjoyed growing up; slow and upbeat!!!
4,Almost perfect....,"All the cuts here are great, and really help capture the sound of their era: Late 80's/early 90's ""new jack swing"" sound that was all the rage at the time. But the disc is missing a couple of tracks that no true fan should be without: ""Born Not To Know"" was the follow-up to their debut single, ""Little Walter."" And while it wasn't a big hit, neither were a few other cuts on this collection. A more essential jam is ""House Party (I Don't Know What You Come To Do)"" from the House Party 2 soundtrack. It's easily one of the group's best party anthems, right up there with their crossover smash ""Feels Good.""OK, those may be minor quibbles with an otherwise terrific collection. Like PM Dawn, the Tony's were ahead of their time, and too-often ignored by the public-at-large. But HITS is a fine (though incomplete) retrospective."
5,thank you,"the cd is off the hook. I have always been a fan, and when i ordered this cd it brought back all those good memories."
5,"Perfect album, brings sun in your eyes!","I love this album. It is definitely one of the best albums of this sort of popmusic in the 90's. Every song is a classic. If you get your hands on this album (which may not be easy), you are sure to forget all your troubles while listening to it. The album is relatively slow (as the title suggests), very melodic, and leaves you in a jolly mood for the rest of the day."
1,I agree with other reviewers,"It's funny, I agree with much of what the other reviewers say, but they seem to not realize they are talking about flaws with the book. Applescript is entering a ""golden age"". It is declining and becoming redundant now that OS X allows us to run more up to date versions of free and open source scripting languages like Python, Perl, etc. I also agree with other reviewers that the author has an ""extremely erudite writing style"", which is a huge negative for a book about a scripting language meant for total beginners. The scholarly writing style used by academics is completely inappropriate for books to learn how to use a programming language or tool. David Mertz's book and articles on Python suffer from the same problem, and he too is a former liberal arts academic, but his writing is targetted to non-beginners using Python for text processing, not a ""definitive guide"" meant for everyone."
2,Outdated,"I absolutely love almost all O'Reilly books, with the exception of the books by Jesse Liberty (horrible writer, never buy any book by him), and own well over 20 of their books myself so please do not take this as a knock against O'Reilly.When the book was written it was accurate but AppleScript has changed drastically since Xcode 2.0 and when Xcode 4.0 comes out shortly it will change even more. If you're looking for an AppleScript book you'll need to wait a few months till the newer books are released with current, relevant information. Not even Apple has bothered to update their own documentation in years so the novice is pretty much left out in the cold.This book was printed over four years ago and in computer time that is a LONG time. Keep this in mind for ANY computer development book. Computer systems change at a dramatic rate so you absolutely must get the latest books to make sure you have the best info."
5,Finally We Have A Complete AppleScript Reference Book,"After over 10 years using AppleScript, I found information in this book that I didn't know. The problem with AppleScript is that easy things are possible and hard things are very hard. This book does a fantastic job of showing how to resolve the many problems that can arise when you try and create scripts more complex than a ""Hello World"" script."
3,Disappointing,"This book is a true disappointment in the realm of scripting books. First of all, this book repeats the same examples over and over again, providing very little light on new topics and ideas. This book is great for someone that has no real interest in doing anything powerful with Applescript. If you want to just dabble in program control and finder tricks, it works...but for the price so does Learn Applescript in 24 Hours"
1,Miserable book if you are looking for something understandable.,"At no place in this book is there a simple example. Every AppleScript is complex, does more than one thing, and is anything but obvious.Why can't there be one example where the author shows you something simple: maybe how to create a new folder on the Desktop? Is it so easy that it doesn't have to be demonstrated? Hardly.I was thrilled when I ordered this book, then furious when it arrived in the mail. If you want something that is understandable, then go elsewhere, because this book does everything but explain how to use AppleScript in a straightforward way.I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. Understand that you are not getting something that easily understood."
3,Jezebel,"I was expecting a little more detail about the hierarchy of the principality, The kind of stuff that would be known by someone who has dealt with many of the underling spirits clear down to the 'worker bees' but it was still OK and worth the $10 spent would have rather had an Ebook."
2,OK - just.,"This DVD would have been ok if I'd bought it for $5, but unfortunately, the four artists I bought if for - namely, Leonard Cohen, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and Buffy Sainte Marie - all together hardly made up five minutes of the video. Apart from that - the video starts badly, but picks up as it goes along. There are a few interesting moments, but the balance of time allotted to each artist seems totally askew. There's about 15 minutes devoted to each of the first artists covered, which makes the one minute mini coverage of others an absolute crashing disappointment, and perhaps colours my opinion of the merits of this DVD. I had assumed that Leonard Cohen would be 'the main man' due to the title, which comes from one of Cohen's songs. Just goes to show - never assume. As they say - it makes 'an ass of u and me'."
3,The Long List of Canadian Musicians,"Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell and Glen Gould are on the short list. Add Gordon Lightfoot for The Wreck of the Edmond Fitzgerald. The Band has a DVD which is #1 on Rolling Stone's list. But Lenny Breau and Wilf Carter? Who would have known who they are?It is a long list, but the DVD would have been much better if they had thrown in some performances by the ones we know instead of short clips of The Crew Cuts, The Four Lads and others at the bottom of the list.Still, the DVD is worth a viewing if you're really into kitsch."
5,"big, big heart...great big love...in the big big world","Germano's warmest, lightest, most musically ornate album, and a nice breather after the dark intensity of Geek The Girl. Not to say she isn't looking at things with any less of a sharp, brutally honest focus, but musically it is very rich and has a more diffuse, soothing feel. And where Geek dealt with the scars of adolescence, Circus seems to fuse a sense of childlike wonder to the more sober self-forgivings of that stage where we've somehow grown up. This has some of her finest songs ever, from the percussive ""I Love A Snot"" to the sparse ""We Suck"", and the indescribable deep-end dives into contradictions of ""Baby On The Plane"", ""Messages From Sophia"" and ""Big Big World"". It took a little longer to get into than some of her other albums, but I can't see myself ever being without this disc now."
3,This is a good one.,"This is a really great record at an incredible price. It's not as 5 star as ""Happiness"", and is not quite as dark as ""Slide"". But it is indeed moody. A good way to introduce yourself to this excellent artist. Then go out and buy ""Geek the Girl""."
3,"Nice, but a step down from Germano's previous two albums","Lisa Germano makes exactly the kind of music you would LEAST expect from John Mellencamp's former violinist: Moody (moody must be part of the job description for the 4AD label) and usually slow songs that discuss events in the life of a passive slacker waif. It's hard to believe Germano, who as always plays a variety of instruments, is the loser that she keeps singing about. This album is listenable throughout, and has some nice moments, but isn't in the same league with her last two albums, ""Happiness"" and ""Geek the Girl."" If you're new to Germano, go with one of those instead. The songwriting here isn't as consistent, and there's more self-indulgence, such as snippets of her cat yowling between tracks. The best song here is ""I Love a Snot"", about the boyfriend who makes her believe she's tubby and ugly. Also good are ""Victoria's Secret"" and ""We Suck"", which seems to be about her ex-boyfriend introducing his new girl."
5,GREAT BOOK,"I SAW IT IN A STORE AND HAD TO BUY IT ONLINE. ITS CHEAPER YA KNOW. ITS COOL, IF YOU LOVE THE 80'S."
3,The queen from Provence,A bit childish in the dialogue but not too bad historically. A fun holiday read if you like historical/fictional novels.
1,useless,"For the price of this book with a cd, it is absolutely not worth it. The images are scanned (very crappy job of scanning by the way). They ARE NOT vectors, they're flattened. You have to use a tracing tool yourself in the illustrator or photoshop. Images are very good though, but I would buy just the book without the cd."
1,Book is cool - CD is worthless,The designs in this book are very interesting and useful but the images on the CD are jagged and the EPS files are NOT scalable. This is fine for aspiring designers but any professional will definately not be happy.
3,Problems with the CD,"I enjoyed the Chinese motifs presented in the book, which is why I purchased it. I was not as impressed with the faces; they're too cartoon like. I loved the animals, florals, and scenes. And there's certainly nothing as active and exotic as the Chinese dragon. Lovely book, but I had trouble even getting the CD to open."
4,A solid overview of the industry!,"Start Your Own Executive Recruiting Service provides anyone interested in starting a search firm with a good overview of the industry's basics. This book provides practical information and realistically sets expectations. It's not a complete ""how-to"", there are gaps that will be filled with experience and from other sources but it's a good part of the research and due diligence that must be done before starting your own company - whether you're an experienced recruiter or looking for a career changed. (I have over 15 years in the recruiting industry - the last 7 as the owner of a mid-sized IT staffing firm with a national client-base providing both staff augmentation and permanent placement.)"
4,"Misleading Title, but still great.","First of all, this is not a ""course"" in meditation. It does not guide you step by step, systematically. It is basically a collection of texts on Meditation & enlightenment, all of them very good. Thomas Cleary does a good job of translating (although something seems amiss about the translation of Dogen), and the notes are very helpful. This is a good book to see how much or little meditation has changed. The talks by Man-an are particularly insightful. I would recommend this book to anyone studying the Zen texts of old, but if you want to know how to meditate and need very basic instructions, go elsewhere. This has alot of obtruse explanations & metaphysics that may confuse you if you haven't studied much Zen before."
3,Basic Suchness,"An informative book, but left me wanting more. It was almost too little from each author. I would say it was too short a course, without a summation that is practically applicable."
5,"explosive, superb!!!!!!","this is the best album that yngwie ever created. for 6 months continously, i listen to this album everyday. the melody is absolutely amazing and better than his other previous albums. unfortunately, someone has stollen this album when i left it for a while( i don't think he will like it; only a challenging mind will appreciate this kind of music). if we compare the grunge musicians( i mean idiotic entertainer)with the guitar skills that yngwie has, i would say that the first one is still in the kindergarden and the last one is person with Phd."
2,Great guitar player but poor music,"Of course Yngwie is a great guitar player, but this cd is poor.The kind of Heavy metal of the 80's that has not aged well.Every guitar solo looks like the other, the signer is not great.For myself, I prefer Joe Satriani...he makes better music and better guitar solos."
1,Very poor rhythm,"Nevertheless Yngwie is a great guitarist, this album in my opinion is faded, I really expected more from him, I have no yet his last album, but I hope it will be better."
5,Very Good,"Really nice pilates workouts for pregnancy. I did not find it difficult to do and have not done much pilates before, I had done a few classes and worked with a couple of pilates videos.The routines are of good lengths.Highly recommended if you are looking for pilates"
3,"All in all, an Enjoyable Pilates workout.","I've only done Pilates once before, and have also done some exercises during ""body balance"" classes.I knew the basic rules of holding in your ""bee line"" and the breathing technique.As some peoples reviews have mentioned, the instructor doesn't go into too much detail about this, however I found this Program to be pretty good.When you're doing the exercises you can feel the muscles you're supposed to be working and you do get a good workout -especially the leg exercises.I found the abdominal exercises to be too advanced for me, will the full roll ups, so I adjusted the moves and just went half up. When in doubt I used common sense and sat those exercises out.In all, it's an enjoyable workout and goes really quickly - very easy to fit it into your day as its broken up into two sections."
2,"If you choose this video, have other work outs in addition through the week","I appreciate the way she has modified normal Pilates moves to be safe using your abs during pregnancy and you will get a crazy burn in your hips from the side work out series but that is about all. She does not evenly work out the whole body. She works the abductors (hip muscles) more than any other muscle group, which was really frustrating to me. There is ZERO upper body work done in this video. The music is very boring and not motivating. When I wake up in the morning and think about how I want to work out, this video is the least appealing option. I don't recommend you get this video unless you are looking for a way to work your abs and you are REALLY concerned about your hip muscles and even then I suggest you incorporate many different workouts with this in the week our you will develop strength deficiencies in your body from over working some muscle groups and ignoring many others."
4,good workout,"I found this workout challenging and and set at a good pace. The lighting is not bright enough so you can't always see exactly how to adjust your form and the background music is terrible (a constant ""wonnnng wong"")but the workout itself is great. If you can tolerate the music and ""greyish"" lighting it's defintely a dvd I would recomend."
4,"OMG, this is a workout!",I'm giving this only 4 stars because it was SUCH a good workout that I found it nearly impossible to get through the entire thing...during ALL three trimesters. I have done pilates for years and NONE of my previous classes and videos worked me as hard as this video. The lower body work is very tough...not sure if that is a good or a bad thing! :)
5,VERY PLEASED,"Speedy delivery, great condition! Video is challenging but still easy to do. Your legs definitely will feel the burn!"
4,Good workout!,Very good workout. She has you lay on a blanket for the stomach exercises since you are not supposed to lay straight on your back. She uses regular Pilates workout and just modifies it for us pregnant folk.
3,"Safe for pregnancy, but not as challenging as I had hoped","The exercises are modified for pregnancy and I feel they are safe, but I would like more of a challenge. I am only 24 weeks pregnant, so perhaps as my belly grows this exercise routine will feel more rigorous. I wouldn't recommend learning pilates in pregnancy, but if you have novice experience with pilates, this may be the video for you. I do find the video relaxing and a nice way to cool down after a good cardio workout. It does provide a bit of a workout, but not as much as I had hoped."
4,Pretty good prenatal workout,"I decided to try pilates, I have done yoga for years, while I was pregnant. Because I am a runner and not flexible, I find that this pilates workout is very good for me. I think it'd probably be good even if I wasn't pregnant, it really loosens up my hips. It's a great butt workout, not really a good ab workout, but I guess you can't have more than one ab when pregnant! I would recommend this product to anyone looking to get a bit of a workout while pregnant and waiting to deliver. The woman narrating the video gets to be irritating after a while, so I put it on mute and listen to music."
2,not great,"this is a little too difficult for an average pregnant woman with no previous Pilates experience, as well as maybe a bit self-congratulatory"
2,buyer beware,"i have never written a review of anything in my entire life, but feel it is my duty to warn you that if you are not extremely experienced in pilates , have incredibly strong abdominal muscles during pregancy and have no issues with balance...then do NOT do this workout. I am truly horrified. There are absolutely no instructions or modifications given depending on what trimester you are in. The abdominal workout is downright scary at least for someone in their 3rd trimester. The side leg workout is rigorous but good, however there are stretches shown lying flat on your back..an absolute no no for anyone over 20 wks and there are standing stretches on one leg that are NOT even shown using a chair...very dangerous...and by the way, pre pregnancy i was a 5mile a day runner who was very adept and pilates and yoga...all i can say is in my humble opinion, this workout is nowhere near the vicinity of being safe..buyer beware!"
1,Detrimental to my pregnancy,"I did this Pilates routine three times a week during my pregnancy. I caught a cold in my third trimester and took a break for a week until it was gone. Then I did the routine again and bruised my ribs on the right side. We later found out my baby was in a breech position with his head right under my right ribs. I went into early labor 5 days after bruising my ribs and delivered my baby 6 weeks early by cesarean. Furthermore, I was in shape when I started using this video (running and lifting weights regularly through my first trimester), yet I found it to be an advanced workout. Compared to other pilates DVD's I've found recently, it does not provide ANY beginner level modifications for the exercises.I do not recommend this exercise video for any pregnant woman."
2,Painful!,If you've never done Pilates I recommend not starting. I am an avid fan of yoga and decided to spice up my workouts while pregnant. I needed some change from one Pre-natal Yoga video and walking at the gym. Pilates was so painful and uncomfortable I had to stop less than half-way through. I was able to make it through the breathing/abs section but once I got to the floor section I was almost in tears. I recommend a good yoga video for your pre-natal workouts!
1,Not a challenge,"I am a very active person who works out 6-7 days a week. I am an elementary PE teacher, Zumba fitness instructor, I do regular strength and weight training, and I do the Insanity DVDs by Beachbody. I do not usually do Pilates but wanted something different to add into my workout rotation during my third trimester. I did the video for the first time when I was 28 weeks. I did not feel challenged at all. I had no trouble breezing through the workout. I agree with some of the other reviews that say she does not take adequate time for stretching. I did this video one time and will never use it again. Instead I ordered the Fusion Pilates pregnancy workout and will give that a shot. It requires some weights and lasts for about an hour which sounds like more of the challenge I am looking for."
1,Not one but TWO copies of this DVD were damaged upon receipt.,Amazon must have received a bad batch of this program because both the original copy I purchased and its replacement were so severely scratched that I have now requested a refund. My best advice is to find another Pilates for Pregnancy program.
4,I can feel the burn.,"This is an excellent Pilates video I think I will use even after I have the baby. I am a beginner to Pilates so I know I need to practice more to keep my core more stable to make the exercises more efficient for me.I feel she does the movements almost too fast. I don't have a problem understanding what she wants, but I feel the movements should be slightly slower. That is only my opinion though.I wasn't able to do all the repetitions today because towards the end my posterior and hamstrings were burning, but in a good way. I am sure if I am persistent though that in a couple of weeks I will be much stronger. I have learned the hard way not to push my body more than it can handle. My advice is not to feel bad if you cannot do all the repetitions or all the exercises right away. Take your time. It's better to move at a slower pace than to feel overachieving and then injure your body."
3,Pilates,"Definitely one of the more expensive options on the market, but based on the reviews I selected this DVD. It provides a good work out - even if you were fit before starting. Many of the techniques are standard pilates moves, but she shows you how to be safe in pregnancy. One problem I did have - and this goes for many fitness instructors/DVDs- You shouldn't wear black pants when showing leg moves... it makes it much more difficult to see the moves especially in something like pilates where the moves are small and controlled... for that reason I wouldn't recommend this DVD if you have not done pilates before as identifying the moves can be tricky. However if you know basic pilates already it does give a good work out."
3,"Ok, but would have been better if it was taped outdoors.. or in a nicer studio.",I like this video. I think it may be hard for those who did not have any experience with Pilates before pregnancy though. The only thing I did not care for was the location and this is why I am giving it 3 stars. I think this would have been the ultimate must have pregnancy video if it was taped by a sunny beach with some nature music instead of the stagnate dark warehouse.
5,Fantastic,"I've used the Pilates During Pregnancy dvd several times since I purchased, and I love it. It took me a while to find one that I actually wanted to purchase, and I'm very happy that I chose this one. It's great for women in all stages of pregnancy and any level of pilates. I had never done pilates before, but I plan to continue doing it throughout my pregnancy and after. Definitely a great buy!"
2,Maybe not great for pregnancy,"I considered myself in good shape before I got pregnant but once I found out I was expecting I stopped my routine until after my first trimester. I thought this was difficult and uncomfortable in my second trimester. I think if you are a pilates teacher or a frequent class goer, this may be perfect but it was not for me."
5,amazing workout,Pilates During Pregnancy is a challenging and safe workout that quickly yields results. I found the excercises to be fluid and evenly paced. The video is broken into two workouts with is much easier for my schedule. Great workout!
2,Couldn't do it,I'm a semi beginner to pilates and in my 2nd trimester. The exercises were too much for me to handle. I love pilates but I was unable to perform the exercises completely.
5,LOVE IT !!!,"I would just like to start by saying that I love this DVD!! Before I became pregnant I was an avid fan of anything Pilates. I loved the way my body looked and the way I felt. When I found out that I was pregnant I immediately started looking for a pregnancy workout that incorporated pilates. The first dvd that I bought was Pilates in Pregnancy and it was horrible, the pace was so slow and it didn't make me feel like I had accomplished anything. So I had to start my search all over again. I saw this dvd, read the reviews, and took my chances. I must say that disappoint is not a word that I would use in the same sentence with this dvd. It is great!!! I do this workout every night and it makes me feel really good about the way my pregnancy and my body are progressing. I would recommend this for any mom-to-be. If you purchase this dvd, you will be happy that you did."
3,"OK, but not very informative","As far as videos go, I guess it's OK. The flow is good and it's not cheesy. I just didn't find it all that helpful and don't see myself doing the workout. I can do the same exercises by myself while watching more entertaining TV. The workout consists of basic ab series stuff which she does leaning against a stack of folded blankets that offer a slight incline. Then a few things like spine stretch and roll-up. The second part is a bunch of side kicks and butt work, which was challenging.It's not a good video if you don't already know pilates as she doesn't really go over a lot of the techniques that make pilates effective and challenging.In general, it was an OK workout for pregnant people, but it didn't give me the info I was looking for as to what's good to do and what's not good to do during the different trimesters and how to modify traditional pilates exercises."
3,Good if you are trained,"This is a solid set of exersizes, but lacks form and technique instruction throughout. I think it is good if you just want to know what to follow and already have a pilates background and good form. The filmimg is all over the place. I don't need funky angles and a foot in my face in an exersize video. I do use it though."
2,not for this intermediate,"I did Pilates for a few years before I got pregnant but still found this video challenging. Doing both the abs and legs together was too much for me. I also wished there would have been more instruction on proper form, etc. before beginning the exercises (she has all these blankets stacked but doesn't mention how they should be stacked or what she's trying to support). I ended up switching to prenatal yoga but I still do some of the Pilates leg moves that I did in my prior practice."
3,Needs trimester specific details,"I have taken Pilates classes before and also practice yoga on a regular basis. This DVD has a nice challenging lower body section that gives you a good ""burn"". However, the ab section is completely impractical when you are in your third trimester. She does not offer enough explanation and does not provide trimester specific modifications. You might as well just do a normal Pilates workout, but lean against some pillows. I found this very lacking as a specifically ""pregnancy"" workout video."
4,Great pilates video!,"I really like the pilates routine on this dvd, which is broken into 2 segments, abs (15 min) and lower body (30 min). It is a great pilates workout - pregnant or not! In fact, I found the lower body routine to be more strenuous than the ""regular"" pilates videos I've used! The only significant modification I could identify is that the ab exercises are done propped on pillows. This doesn't make it much different from any other pilates dvd, but it is nice having a pregnant instructor. :) She is pleasant but not cheesy. The dvd could be improved upon by having a more attractive setting (it is in a very bland room) and some relaxation and stretching at the end. The routine ends somewhat abruptly. Overall I am very happy with this dvd and know it will go to good use over the next few months!"
4,Great- if you have experience,"I recommend this pilates video for those who have done pilates before. Otherwise, there is a good chance you may be doing the exercises wrong (as I did before taking a few classes).Otherwise, it is a great, challenging workout with a teacher who is pregnant- which is a great plus."
4,Pleased,"The leg workout is kind of intense, but after doing it a couple times it is a really good work out."
4,Loved it- wished it had more for the price,"I thought this pilates workout was fantastic. It was great while pregnant-and REALLY great post-partum. It was fun in the weeks after my delivery to progress from the suggested three blankets to none, which went much quicker than expected. I think this can be credited to doing this video my whole pregnancy.One complaint- this video seems a bit expensive for only 35 minutes of workout material. At a minimum for this price, the workout segments should total an hour, where the user can do the whole thing or pick-and-choose. But I guess this falls in line with pregnancy stuff generally being more expensive. However, this is why I gave it only 4 stars and not 5."
4,"Challenging Workout, Will Keep This In My Rotation","I did Pilates a few years back when I was in much better shape, and at that time didn't find Pilates very difficult or painful. Since then I've lost a lot of muscle, and my early pregnancy sickness didn't help. This workout was more difficult for me than expected, I did feel a burn, and I know my form was lacking. However, the length is very good, and because it wasn't as ""easy"" for me as expected, I look forward to doing it again and again until I can tell my fitness level and form has improved. It's not my favorite workout, but I do plan to keep it in my rotation, it was definately working parts of my lower body that aren't being hit by other workouts. I am now late in my 2nd trimester, and happy that I purchased this DVD."
1,How can I rate my purchase of TWO when I can only get ONE?,"This is the SECOND time I have been OFFERED this product via e-mail, and the first time I was sent one set, and then later told there would be no more. That item was returned. Then I received ANOTHER e-mail and I attempted to order another two sets. Guess what.....only ONE was available. ONE SET does me no good. I'll buy the product elsewhere since I can no longer depend on Amazon's service. I used to be a loyal and frequent buyer....now I am just a ""sometimes"" buyer...for obvious reasons."
4,Wonderful Illustrations,"The aims of this book are accurately described in the publisher's review in Amazon's editorial reviews section. While I would not characterize the writing as lively, it is clear and without jargon. The thesis of the book is well set out in Chapter One. The next five chapters, dealing with the 15th Century art of five lesser Renaissance courts, Naples, Urbino, Milan and Pavia, Ferrara, and Mantua, apply the thesis to the respective courts. These chapters are of varying interest, and occasionally are a bit tedious. The short final chapter treats succinctly the rise of Rome in the 16th Century and the decline of the princely courts. The book's excellent illustrations are tied into the text very well, and in my view are the best feature of the book."

2,wrong item,"The description says that this thread is polyester covered with cotton, but it is actually polyester covered with polyester. I'm sure it's good for what it is, but it's not what I ordered."
3,pretty basic white thread,"Seems to be ok, maybe breaks a little easier than ideal, but has more or less worked fine for basic mending."
3,Many Uses!,"Not only have I found a spool of Dual Duty Plus thread great for sewing andmending, but true to its name, can also serve as baby dental floss, Cornishhen trussing, clothesline for damp tissues, and bug leashes."
2,too expensive!!!!!,After i bought this wire i saw i can get it for $42.00 locally.But the wire itself is good but the price is way too high.
3,I suppose that. . .,"from the female point of view this may be great, and certainly I think that classic literature such as Jane A. has messages for us, but I wish that someone should write a similar book for MEN.Ladies, we are just as mystified by your behavior as you are by ours. I read once that there is or was a tribe in the South Seas where all the men lived on one island and all the women on another, and they got together about four times a year. Believe me, there are times when this seems like a very darn good system; it would certainly eliminate a lot of complications.ut we don't live in such a society, and probably would not if we could; we'd miss you, and I think (hope!) you would miss us. Could some author please write a book like this for men?"
3,A look from the slave's viewpoint,"This was a compelling story of the slave days but it does not compare to Frederick Douglas' My bondage and my Freedom. If you're looking for a real insight into the life and struggles of those in chains during slavery, that is the story for you. wow."
1,"Slow reader, poorly written",This is the slowest most poorly written book I've ever begun to read. You would be reading along in the book and it would make a reference to a page number. I'm not one to go back and flip through my reader to see the reference. I kept waiting for the story to begin and it just kept jumping around. No wonder this book was offered free who would buy it?
3,A slave girl's story being an autobiography of Kate Drumgoold,It would have been very tough in those times but it didn't do much for me. She sounded like a lovely person though.RegardsMike
3,Stick with it,"I suppose there is a certain type of reader who will love this book. Martin revels in long quotations from men of science dating back to the Greeks, and from literary works, as well as historical tidbits in general that pertain to sleep in some tangential way. For the rest of us, I say stick with this book, for it has fascinating, and useful, information on sleep.Perhaps, start in Chapter 5, ""The Shapes of Sleep"". While I knew something about the sleep cycle, I had no idea that some of your dreams occur during the hypnagogic and hypnopompic (transition to and from sleep) stages rather than during the REM stage, although this fact correlates very well with experience."
4,Colector's Item,"Absolutely love it, I enjoy listening to music made in the 70's and 80's and only purchase those cd's. My favorite jam on this cd is 'Look after Love' which is not one of the popular songs on this cd so you never hear it being played on the radio therefore I had to get this cd."
2,The Best of Heatwave: Always & Forever,"While I purchased the CD for the title song, I was a little disappointed in the rest of the CD. I guess I didn't know the group's repertoire as well as I thought."
5,Can't stop listening,I'm very pleased at the service provided through Amazon. The music came quickly and I was able to enjoy thoroughly.Excellent job!
4,crust core...need i say more?,"if you like aus rotten you'll like this. early 90s thrash stuff with incredibly political lyrics and dual male/female vocals. unfortunately, this cd is a bit short (27 minutes) and is about half dialog clips but the actual songs are killer!"
5,A superb book.,"The best technical book I've read in ages. I read this book cover to cover, with ease. The text is clear and well organized, and the use of examples is very appropriate. A lot of practical advice is given, especially in the sections labeled ""Design Hint."" The cross-referencing from the appendix makes it easy to use this book as a reference, too. I normally go straight to the spec to learn technologies, but the Schema spec is rough reading; this book makes it all seem so reasonable and simple."
2,Awful as reference,"Since all other reviews are very positive, I'm here to offer a different opinion.I've had this book for over a year now, and I barely use it. Each time I attempt to find something useful in it, the information is scattered over the entire book making it extremely difficult to understand.For example, right now I'm looking up the ""ref"" attribute, and according to the index, it appears on 7 different locations throughout the book, each portion shorter than 1 page. Also, I have seen many tables scattered throughout with exact same information, or one or two differing field values, making it very confusing to understand which table is doing what.And at over 500 pages long, there is a large amount of filler information in this book.Is this book ""definitive""? It looks like it is. Is this book usable? Absolutely not. This is one of the worst investments I've made in computer books.And there is a place about strings in the book where it differs from the official W3C specs."
4,Great Reference Book,This book was very helpful in getting me up to speed with XML Schema. It was written well and I have provided the added detail I needed to go above and beyond up at work. Priscilla's Walmsley's extensive experience is conveyed well in the book and has proven to be a great resource.
3,Order of Material Does Not Facilitate Learning,"True, this book provides a comprehensive look at XML Schema, but the order that the material is presented in leaves much to be desired. It is not until chapter 7 that we begin to learn how to string together element declarations to start building a schema. Chapters 1-6 deal with XML Schema history, a sort of quick tour that does not take the place of a tutorial, Namespaces, Schema composition, Instances and Documentation and extentions. While the ""inverted pyramid"" approach to revealing information may be academically correct -- it has not helped me learn XML Schema efficiently. This book is essentially a retelling of the W3C XML Schema Recommendation.. Based on a search here at Amazon, it looks like there may be a book coming from O'Reilly based on this material.I gave the book 3 stars, as the book seems to be accurate and complete. I don't think that having this book is necessarily a bad thing, perhaps just a bad place to start."
2,boooring,"This book just happens to be *first*. Just wait until some of the other XML Schema books that are listed as ""not yet published"" hit the racks. You'll forget about this book rather quickly.In my opinion, this book serves more as a reference and doesn't really serve-up any good ideas or suggested practices. In addition, one of the most annoying aspects of this book is the SIZE OF THE PRINT. It's so darned big on relatively small pages that when they referred to a figure, I would sometimes have to go backwards or forwards 2 pages. It almost reminds me of writing my college thesis... make the font bigger, spread the text further apart, move in the margins... voila 100 pages..."
1,Only for beginners.,This book take a long time to arrive at any substance on Schemas and is only good for total novices to world of XML Schemas. In-fact the real schema is seen only half way through the book. It definitely is a boring read.
4,"Not what I was expecting, but worth a buy","Being familiar with the Yardbirds only via their widely played pop hits such as the title track and ""Heart Full of Soul"", I was surprised to find that many of the songs on this album sound like Anglicized covers of blues tunes sung by skinny guys (like me) with thready voices. Then I remembered why I bought this album in the first place: I wanted to hear the roots of Rock by a band that was experimenting with American blues (Boom Boom, I Wish You Would, Got to Hurry) and going beyond the blues to form a new sound (For Your Love).This Yardbirds post-Clapton album is a wonderful sample of Music in Transition, and it is definitely worth the money, especially with the extensive bonus tracks such as a sitar version of ""Heart Full of Soul"" and ""Steeled Blues"" featuring amazing steel guitar work by Jeff Beck."
5,"Very Cute, Light Fare","I watched this on a trans-continental flight (I was thrilled to find foreign films on offer - I can't stand popular American films). This was a very sweet ""boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl . . .""Both actors were terrific and there were some great lines. It was exactly what I was looking for - light romance, Bollywood-style!"
4,I have the right,"to give my opinion, because no one else will. This album is a bittersweet, lo-fi, soft but intense, look, into questions about faith and love. The delights of this album include the ecclectic instrumentation and strong songwriting. Reminds me of Califone, with songwriting reminiscent of William Oldham. Enjoy it, I did."
5,This is probably not for everybody,"I was suprised that many of the reviews here were not as good as I might have expected. Personally, I am continually intrigued by their very unique sound-- something like a cross between Devendre Banhardt and The Swans; it's a gloomier, soft-spoken indie-folk with meaningful lyrics and a heavy orchestration. It isn't something that'd go over well at parties, but perfect if you're in the mood to sit and listen. I'd recommend it to fans of the aforementioned Banhardt, Vetiver, et al. and esp. those interested in experimental stuff. Anyway, I highly recommend this as one of my favorites of '04."
3,Sturdy shakiness,"3 1/2Castanets came on like a freakishly western Low, with a curiously clanging approach made for desperate ears. Fortunately, what could have easily gone awry, surprisingly works for the most part, indulgent you-are-here production and all."
1,Empty,"Maybe I just don't get it, but this seems like a pointless and uninteresting collection of music. I usually listen to laid-back and meandering music, but this album doesn't do much even by that standard."
5,Terror and the fear of 'difference',"Appadurai draws on his former work on globalization in Modernity at Large, to propose a set of exciting and innovatively original reflections on the agendas set by post-September 11. The way terrorism is a sequel to former globalizing tendencies, and has been used in local contexts to deal in a discriminating way with 'difference', and 'minorities', is set against larger issues, such as the question of the role of the territorialized nation-state, and deterritorialized global terror. The interest of his approach resides in the fact that it considers a wide range of examples from South Asia to Europe, and the US, thus making the more evident how reductive - to say the least- are views of contemporaneity derived from Huntington's Clash of Civilizations. Appadurai is a genuinely original thinker, an exception in a world which sees a daily proliferation of repetitive and obvious approaches to such issues. An inspiring book I strongly recommend!"
3,Complex answer to a simple problem,"Appadurai's work, Fear of Small Numbers, is not as profound as his Modernity at Large. He breaks down the issue of ethnic and political violence to the fact that, through globalization, the differences between groups have been getting smaller and smaller. This decrease in difference, as he posits, is one of the causal factors of the increased levels of violence that we have witnessed throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In terms of works on globalization, I would give this an average grade."
3,"Not bad, but not as good as I remembered it","This was a pretty decent flick by Larry Bishop (son of Rat Packer Joey Bishop). While I've always been a fan of Joe & Dennis, this film was just a bit too slow paced, but not bad overall. Definitely worth the price, though."
1,"Elmo's World - Shoes, Bugs & Farms","Please do not buy this, I wonder why they even sell this, who would have 95/98/me very rare, I wasted my money on this , bcaz I did not pay any attention to the review, got burnt.Not a very fun game without sound.NO NO NO Never."
5,The Imposter (The Last Gunfighter),Great book and great story with a great action sequence. Characters are well thought out and sequence of events is riveting
2,"Johnston's worst written book. Too much bad language. Sex with a male child. VERY BAD, SHAMEFULL!!!",2 stars for the plot. Men raping a 14 year old boy was not necessary in the story. The writer waited to the last to put that part in.
4,a brilliant parable of faith and doubt,"A beautiful parable about a man's constant attempt to find faith in spite of being caught in an ocean of doubts. Lagervkist, much like Platanov, uses defamiliarization to create a world that is not quite mystical, but not quite mundane either. The whole story has this air of solemn profundity about it which occur so rarely in fictions that deal with the problems of faith and doubt. This was my first foray into Scandinavian fiction, and I'm glad I choose this work."
4,Interesting Book from an Overlooked Author,"By examining the life of Barrabas, the acquited, Lagerkvist raises some crucial points on faith. By looking at the way men looked at Christ in the years following his death, he challenges us to rethink both our faith and our view on life. A parable about all mankind, Barrabas should be read by anyone wishing to challenge his beliefs. Also, check out The Dwarf by Lagerkvist."
4,"Barabbas examines the notion of being ""tied"" to another huma","Barabbas, although essentially the untold story of the acquited Barabbas, also examines the existential notion of being tied to another person, a la Waiting for Godot. The novel also employs the motif of the doppelganger in the figures of Christ, the hare-lip girl, and Sahek(sp.?), all of whom exhibit modes of faith and understanding which are incomprehensible to Barabbas. Barrabas cannot believe, essentially because he doubts, but ""wants to believe"" in order to justify his own existence. Without this struggle he remains only a name on the lips of the faithful. Barabbas' struggle represents, in parable form, the human need for meaning in a meaningless world."
1,Had potential but ......,"This is not The Robe or The Silver Chalice or The Big Fisherman or many other wonderful historical Biblical fiction books. The theology is poor; even knowledge of the scripture is poor. It's poorly written, sad, and I don't recommend it. In fact, I threw it away after reading it. It wasn't worth my time. If you like good, inspiring historical Biblical fiction leave this book alone and read one of the above mentioned."
5,Very Fine and Absorbing Short Read.,"First off, this reviewer is not convinced of the existence of any supernatural being in outer space/heaven or anywhere for that matter. Regardless, this is an exploration of the inner and outer life of Barabbas, the condemned man who was replaced at Golgotha by Jesus. This is a beautifully written story that I read in about two hours. We tour life in Jerusalem, meet individuals who ring true to the place and times, and explore underground mines where slaves never escaped, except in a few very lucky cases. Many of spiritual ideas of the time are explained as well. And the fire in Rome is well done too. So for a fine ride through the Christian and non-Christian world of about 1960 years ago, and an exploration of the roots and meaning of religion, this book is a very fine start!"
4,Thoughtful reflection,"Barabbas is one of those books that covers a lot of territory in a small package. Purely a work of fiction, it is a classic ""what if."" The story follows the life of one of history's most famous names, yet a person that we know nothing about. What I found interesting was the honest portrayal of the times. The era was not a clean intellectual period, but rather a dirty, dangerous, largely illiterate time in history when life was typically short and painful. It is also striking what little information the believers of the time had. Where we have multiple Bible translations, study groups, commentaries, etc., they became followers based on the smallest scraps of information, and were unable to articulate their faith in little more than a few abstract sentences. Yet, they were passionate believers. A thoughtful book worthy of investing a couple hours into on a rainy evening."
4,Fit for Life Really Works and so does this book!,"I've been a real fan of the Fit for Life/Natural Hygiene way of life. In fact, I've been on this program and I've seen wonderful results. In fact, I've spoken to several highly respected doctors about Diamond's book and ideas to confirm his findings. They concluded that he is right on track! In fact, this new book allows us to look into various forms of treatment that can give us the strength to fight diseases. It seems that our society is satuated with the common medical practices of taking medication to ease the pain, eat what we like and become depressed when our bodies give out from neglect. At least, there is another way to cope with sickness and disease...change our eating habits and watch the body thrive! If for nothing else, you will feel better...isn't that worth it?"
1,Google Harvey Diamond,"I learned about the ""Diamond Method"" from Tony Robbin's Living Health seminar and of course I now wish I had done some research before I wasted my money (on both Living Health and Fit for Life).Turns out the diet is based on Natural Hygiene pseudoscience. You may lose weight following it, it is a diet after all, but everything you ""learn"" about food-combinding, fermentation etc. is factually wrong.Amazon has a great selection of books on diet, this isn't one.Do some research before you jump on the bandwagon. Here's a start: http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/fitforlife.html"
1,Should be 0 stars!,"Props to this dude for actually selling this as a book. It's really a complete, not funny joke. I saw him on QVC and I can now see why he was sooo vague with the questions. This book can be summarized with 3 thoughts. 1. Eliminate all animal products, 2. drink perfect, spring water, 3. and fast frequently for three to five days. This is all alleged by the author to jumpstart a ""lymphonic"" gland. I'm like, uhhhhhhh, what? Somehow he got other doctors to endorse the program."
5,Fit for Life a New Beginning,This is a must read for anyone who is afraid to have cancer. Mr. Diamond gives you a lot of practical information to help you prevent this disease. Although the book is a few years old its information still is pertinant to today. This is a great book to read followed by his Fit for Life not Fat for Life.
5,The Truth Unleashed,"This is a great book with Harvey at times unleashing his full venom at the medical profession, food industry and fellow dieticians. He is speaking up for the truth and I happen to believe him. Why? Because I have tested and followed the Fit for Life principles myself and they work.However before reading this book (which I call Fit for Life III), I would advise buying and following the principles laid out in the first two books i.e. Fit for Life and Fit for Life II. They are easier to read, gentler (probably because they were written in partnership with Marilyn!) and cover the essential dietary/lifestyle principles you need to follow.Good luck and God bless."
2,not so sure....,"I purchased this before doing any research. It started out promising, but those promises started sounding a little too ideal---with not much fact to back it up. I've since read some critical reviews of the information and think much is based on fantasy. While I whole-heartedly agree with the author's disdain for much of the pharmaceutically-driven American medical philosophy, I'm not so sure this is ultimately much more sound. I think there must be better out there."
3,Effective Quackery,"I followed the Fit for Life regimen and successfully lost a great deal of weight with it. I also did feel more energetic while following it.However, any research done into the pseudo-scientific claims that serve as this diet's underpinnings reveal the ""science"" to be largely bogus.That being said, I think there is some validity to the idea that the way we combine our foods does have an impact on our energy levels. If you follow this diet for a week or so, you will notice that by combining foods as described, the lethargy that typically follows after eating a meal is non-existent.I've found this diet an effective way of losing weight, but I don't think it's necessary to eat like this all the time."
3,Not as good as the first one,"This goes over much of the same info that is in his first book. Still a good read if you can manage to get through the repitition, but if you're easily bored and have read the first I would buy something else."
2,Disappointed in delivery,"After waiting for 29 days, I did not receive the book and was issued a full refund. The delivery range was so broad that it took this long to realize the book was lost and I had to rush to buy a much needed missing gift."
5,love,This book saved my life. Anyone who needs to change their life style must read this book. It's the only way to eat right.
5,"Great Read, learned a lot for better health!","Your body talks to you, this book tells you how! Everyone who has any health issue really should want to read this book. Over-weight, runny nose, or other, what you learn is priceless!"
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book based on the universal high praise it received on this website. I've been reading it, and it's been a struggle. I'm nearly 200 pages into the book, and I'll persevere till the end, because I need the knowledge contained in it for my business, but it's been slow. I often have to read a passage over and over and over again until I grasp the point the author is trying to make, because his writing style is so confusing."
2,Long winded,"This text does a great job of explaining the fundamentals of computer architecture, however it dilutes the great explanations with hundreds of pages of case studies that are often hard to understand and in some cases not relevant to the topics of the text. I would definitely recommend that if you are just starting to learn about computer architecture look else where for something that does not dilute the fundamentals with such complicated examples. However if you are already familiar with architecture/micro-architecture you might find this to be a worth while read to learn more about how these theories are applied in many of today's modern chips, especially the Intel chip-set."
5,Tanenbaum is good...Gotta give him that.,"I'm only 1/3 through the book so far, but it's been good. There's even a few snippits of dry humor that make it a little more interesting. As far as breadth and depth of material goes, it starts out assuming you know very little about hardware/architecture, and takes you step by step from there. Assuming the book stays as interesting and downright wooty, I'll give it 5 stars. It's not very often that I find a computer book that I'm willing to read cover to cover."
5,Yes Yes.,Good book to understand the organization of computers. I used it in undergrad course. Will recommend it.
5,Must-have,"This is Blood Ulmer's best and most approachable album. Some records are just flat-out interesting from start to finish, and this is one of 'em. I can remember the first time I heard this, 25 years ago."
3,too much fiddle,"Good as this is, it's not a representative album or Blood's best. The dosey-do on a lot of the songs is sort of jarring. I don't care what xgau says--I can't really enjoy it. Free Lancing is much better (please reissue!) or seek out a live set."
2,Not a good fit,"I bought this clamp kit to fit a Memphis Shades ""The Shooter"" windshield (which I love)for my 2010 super glide custom. Problem is my handle bars are 1.1/2 inches in diameter, these are 1.1/4 and are the largest Memphis Shades makes. I had to spend another $100 to machine clamps that would fit my bars. Bad info from Memphis Shades. My point is they are great and easy to install but only if you have 1.1/4 inch diameter bars or smaller."
5,La Belle Opera,"Harnoncourt really captures the spirit of this light opera, and the entire cast seem to enjoy themselves, which makes it a thoroughly enjoyable experience. This is Offenbach the way it should be done."
2,Zurich Opera House is so mediocre...to do with the audience?,"This production is tres epatant for all the bankers and industrialists and moribund widows of Zurich on a Saturday night but is overblown, silly and distracts from the music. E Schmarre as the Swiss would say. Like all the productions - yes I mean ALL - at the world's most expensive but most bland Opera House the combination of must-be-Swiss chorus, players and above all audience reduces even the music to occasional jolliness but no thrills and even less magic. The best thing to do with this is to turn it on for the music and don't look. Also don't listen too hard to the Francais Federal. Ugly! For real opera go to the cheapest seats in Vienna, New York, London, Berlin or Milan. Never be tempted into the horrid Zurich opera house. Not even to the front row."
1,God Forgives I Don't,"We really didn't enjoy this movie. 1969, so early on in their careers. No humor or slapstick here but a serious western with a not so fantastic plot and sometimes hard to follow. As mentioned by another critic, Wham USA is turning out the worst quality DVD's. The one's we've received are really poor quality. If you can get this one by some other manufacturer, do so to add to your Trinity collection."
2,Watch out its Wham,"After reading through the product description and earlier reviews I felt confident I was buying a copy of ""God Forgives...I Don't"" that wasn't produced by ""Wham"". I was wrong my Amazon purchase was inferior. My suggestion try to find this movie on VHS."
4,God Forgives...I Don't,"This has to be one of the Worst Spaghetti Westerns I have seen,I saw this on Netflix instantly so I neither had to pay to see it(Monthly service) or buy the actual dvd.It is annoying not just because of the Dubbing/overdubbing of the voices but also How long and drawn out the movie is,What I do like(not the Acting) is the story,Everyone on Train Is Dead,one survived and was left to die.end of story?No,It's a Western or ""Foreign Western"" and Revenge is on the way,It is worth watching to see the ending but is it something I would watch again?(probably not,I am a fan of the Sergio Leone/Man with No Name Films Instead).Would I buy it?No,But that does not necessarily mean someone else should not give it a try."
5,Excellent!,This book is great for the price. It outlines a little bit of everything but enough for you to feel competent in the subject.
2,Just read your textbooks!!,"I can honestly say that this book was responsible for a 1/4 of our pediatric students failing the class. I am not sure if our professors were familiar with the book, but the fact is that the material presented here is way too simplified and the fact that Barbara from Tennessee got through the class without ever opening the textbook really scares me to death. There is nothing wrong with using study aides but for the love of your clients don't rely 100% on them, you're going to find yourself having your rear-end handed to you one day and possibly losing your license."
5,Excelent laptop bag,"the computer fits perfectly, it's really light, small and comfortable to carry around. Great european design"
4,Tucano laptop briefcase,Macbook fits perfectly in the case. Easy to carry. Good for travelers. I love the color.
1,smaller than I imagined,"I previously had a Tucano laptop PC briefcase for a business Vaio that I returned with the Vaio when I left the company. That Tucano model was large enough for my new (thicker) Toshiba Satellite. However, this Tucano model will barely fit the Satellite, power cord, and a small mouse. Make sure your PC is as small as a Macbook, or you will have the same problem."
1,Where do you hook your shoulder strap?,I just received my bag and liked it but how can you use the nice shoulder strap as mine has nothing to hook it too???? Can you anyone explain that? Thanks J.r.I mean no loops on the sides where it should go. I am shocked!
1,Quick Body for Life rip-off,"Connelly was the owner of the supplement company Met-Rx when this book was released, just after Bill Phillips (the owner of his competition) released Body for Life.BFL is a great plan, well written and easy to follow. Body Rx is a blatant stab at BFL with little or no regard as to whether the programme works or not. Body Rx is so blatent as to even almost exactly mimic the cover of Body for Life - with Connelly posing in black with the book title in red font - exactly as Body for Life's cover is laid out?!Disappointing as I've met Dr. Connelly and he is a very smart man, just happened to have rushed this book to the market as a reaction to his competition..."
4,Spectaculary spooky,Unique late '20's french organist emits an intoxicating chordal range that at once recalls the grandeur of religious pipe works as well as all the dark mystique early 20th century decadence could provide.
4,"Wonderful, old fashioned romance among the redwoods.","Written in in 1918, this is the story of one man's struggle to hold onto his inheritance--the 'valley of the giants' (the redwoods), and win the affection of the girl he loves, while remaining true to his ideals. I enjoyed this book because of its references to, and descriptions of, the awe-inspiring California redwoods."
4,Heartwarming Story,"This is a heartwarming story of an admirable young man's commitment to his and his father's shared ideals-the family's redwood timberland and his mother's memory-and the wonderful relationship he has with his father. A star-crossed romance, adventure, and the struggle against a ruthless business rival (the guardian of his sweetheart) add excitement. Reminiscent of stories by Willa Cather and John Steinbeck."
4,Great Story,"Since this book is now in the public domain, Librivox has a free audiobook version of this. I had great difficulty stopping 'reading' this book It is very well written and the 'back and forth' one-up-manship between the Cardigan's and the Colonel was even suspenseful at times. Add to that the mounting tension between Bryce and Shirley and it is very much a 'page-turner'. LOVED it!"
5,"Great punk band but not ""Sunburn"" Fuel from Pennsylvania","This CD is awsome if you're into punk. Don't expect to hear the Fuel from Pennsylvania that released the Sunburn CD. These guys are faster and have been around longer. Some of the members from this band now play in another punk band called Pinhead Gunpowder. Don't buy this CD expecting to hear another Shimmer. If you want the ""Sunburn"" Fuel, buy THEIR newest CD: Something Like Human ...which is also an awesome CD...but its not kick-a** punk like this!"
1,Poor wear durability,These were a Christmas gift that only lasted for three wearings. The heal became quickly threadbare. Compared to other socks that were bought at the same time these were the earliest dropouts.
4,Women's Argyle Sock,"These socks are satisfactory, but I was hoping both pair would be thicker and warmer. The tops are a bit tight for me."
5,Instant Fan Because of Romanza,"I discovered Zucchero on the Romanza album and had to have more. I visited Borders and picked ""The Best of Zucchero:Sugar. I recorded the CD for my car tape player and now I blast it as loud as I want to on my one hour trips out to see my grandchildren in the country. Bocelli played in our rented car on our last trip to Italy; Zucchero will blast his way across Italy in our car next April as we discover more of Italia and enjoy speaking our newest language once again. His collection of songs on this CD is wonderful. Now I plan to visit amazon.com to order more. I do wish all Italian lyrics had English translations. I use them to learn more Italian. If ALL lyrics are at least printed in Italian, I translate them and submit them to my Italian teacher for correction. I am not very good at taking dictation in Italian to get the words down if they are not included."
1,Discontinued Product,Just spoke with Macco Akzo customer service - 800-634-0015 (Manufacturer of Liquid Nails products). This specific product line (DR-807) was discontinued in 2008. Any tubes currently on the market are at least 4 years old...
3,whiny vocals and sometimes lame lyrics damper album,"I bought this album after hearing ""shakin and a bakin"" on the radio. Slightly reminiscent of the Black Crows, it just kind of grew on me. While I do occaisionally pop in the cd for that track as well as ""California"" and ""Scared Boy"". All three of these tracks are available to sample so if you don't dig what you hear from these three, the album will probably just end up gathering dust."
5,One of the best animation selections available,"This disc features a mix of assorted animation by members of the NFB that is sure to please the most discriminating animation collector. From the wild, thoughtful and free experimentations of Norman McLaren to more lighthearted contributions that don't compromise the overall quality of the whole presentation at all - if you are a fan of experimental / independent animation, this is a must for your DVD collection. You won't be dissapointed."
4,NFB Cartoon Shorts,"Having spent time in Canada as a kid, I remember (fondly) a number of the short cartoons that are on this DVD. The features were largely from independent film makers who were funded by the National Film Board of Canada, and always covered interesting subjects about growing up and/or outdoor life in Canada.Given their age (and relative commercial unimportance) I had given up hope that I would ever see them again...but here they are, in a beautifully-restored collection. What Leonard Maltin has to do with this, I don't know, but if you (like me) long to see these features once again, this is the DVD for you!"
3,"Better than most collections, but not outstanding","This is certainly worth buying for ""Begone Dull Care"" and ""The Street,"" and I applaud Maltin for including those, but it's frustrating to see overplayed clunkers like ""The Cat Came Back"" included on collection after collection of FBC animation (it's on at least two other dvd's that I'm aware of) while so much great work in their vaults never sees the light of day.I understand this a reflection of Maltin's personal taste, but the FPC's dvd releases share too much material with each other to make buying more than one or two worthwhile."
5,The National Film Board of Canada Rocks!,"This video rocks! ""The Cat Came Back"" was a cool one and ""Log Drivers Waltz"" was funny. Wanna know why that cartoon's so funny? 'Cause people can't really drive logs! This video's rockin'! If your'e a lover of cartoons,then this is the video for you!Also,""Pas de Deux"" was one of the best French-Canadian cartoons of all time! Hopelly more videos with the cartoons of The National Film Board of Canada will come soon,so be sure to buy this video now."
2,Leonard Maltin's Yap-Yap!,"Will Leonard Maltin Please GO AWAY!........He Ruins Every DVD He Shows Up On!......We're Not Stupid!...We Are Able To Make Judgements On Our Own, Without The Insufferable Drivel Of L.M!....Since I Could'nt Cut Maltin's Bologna Out To View Real Creative Artist's Work...I Returned It!"
1,Forget it,"Unless you want a copy of ""The Cat Came Back"" forget this. The animations are no better than flip pages by 5th graders, except for the CGI. So some guy can scratch on film, big deal. This is art? The stories really poor and uninteresting. ""Cat"" is the saving grace."
3,For Vets Only,"It's difficult to follow the action scenes if you aren't familiar with the military/slang jargon that existed at the time. While O'Nan makes some small effort to translate for us, we're left attempting to figure much of the vocabulary out for ourselves, almost by trial and error. This never really worked for me so I had to keep rereading passages that were supposed to be fast-paced - which defeated the purpose. I imagine vets would find this much easier to deal with than the average reader. Otherwise I found it a compelling, if gruelling, story that wove the time periods together well. The ending was, however, both confusing and somewhat anticlimactic."
2,Falters and wavers,"I'm very glad that so many readers liked this book, and that it's been a good one for Vietnam vets. But I felt that this book never found its way. It felt like snapshots from a depressive life, intermingled with a thriller. I guess it just didn't work for me as literature, or as a thriller. I was was drawn to O'Nan by his work in Granta 54, but I probably won't try him again."
4,Dealing with incurable illness,"Stewart O'Nan plunges the reader into the chambers of horrors that are the aftermath of Vietnam. He understands the razoredge tension of being underfire, the hopelessness of being without the security of even minimal coping that eats the brains of many Vietnam Vets, and he knows the vagaries of the promised paths of healing from physical and mental war wounds. Some writers describe actual moments of battle contact better than O'Nan but few dig into the battle rattle that so chronically impaled the men and boys who came home from Vietnam. And with all this ammunition on board, O'Nan has written a very fine novel that is, yes, grounded in the sequelae of war, but succeeds in unraveling a fascinating story of at least one man's survival. This is a pithy book and deserves to be placed on the shelf along with O'Brien, Caputo, Turner and the other fine writers who still struggle to make sense out of the irrational Vietnam error."
3,"Compelling, powerful and provoking","This was the first novel I've read by Stewart O'Nan and I was very impressed by his style. Although the book bathed the reader in Vietnam's horrors, it also, surprisingly, had occasional glimpses of wry humor which, because of the gore involved, were oases of relief. I congratulate O'Nan on the successful completion of a book on the most difficult of subjects -- war and it's atrocities. I'm looking forward to reading more from O'Nan."
4,I love the first song,"I bought this CD for one song, When Will I See You Again...I wish that The Three Degrees had other songs that I like that much, so it wouldn't seem like a waste buying the whole CD. I have to say that I have been looking for this one song for so many years, that it is worth it to me...I didn't hesitate to order it when I found it on Amazons website."
4,"When Will I See You Again My Favorite Song ""Maybe""","I have this CD and it's wonderful. My only complaint is that the Record Companies keep releasing many alternate versions of my favorite song ""Maybe""The version I would like to see on CD is from the album ""Maybe"" 5:37 Roulette (SR-42050) or the ""45"" ""Maybe"" 5:37 Roulette (19924) bw ""You're The One"" which ever information is helpful."
5,The Best of The Three Degrees,"I've enjoyed the album by the The Three Degrees very much. The particular song I wanted ""When Will I See You Again"" has brought back many memories. I couldn't find out who recorded the album until I checked into Amazon. You had it and I'm really satisfied with your help. Thank You Amazon I'll be buying from you again...Many Thanks,Suzanne Newman"
5,OH YES!!!!!,Good music here have it in my car good traveling music plus all the girls can sing i have certain tracks i always play!! lol but good buy!
3,A virginal hero??,"I have to admit that I liked this book a little. It was humorous and fun to read, but the fact that the hero was a virgin was just plain blah. Not only a virgin, but shy, a man that blushes is not a man I want to read about in a historical romance. However, I'll give a three because the story was fun, and I love all time travel romances. Just wish the man would have been a REAL desparado."
2,Falls short in the comfort department,"I got mine at a local Microcenter store for about $8. I use them for on-line gaming chat. Functionally they work just fine. Occasionally when I am trying to adjust them the clear plastic tube that you speak into comes off, but goes back on just fine. I asked the folks I chat with and they say they can hear me real well.I like that they can be folded up and thrown into my laptop bag without taking up much room (however, for trips where I have to fly, I still take my full size over the ear noise-canceling Sony headphones). They have held up well from a wear and tear perspective.My problem is with the comfort. After wearing them for longer than 10-15 min, they dig into the back of your ears. I find myself constantly trying to adjust them on my head so they don't hurt my ears. I have worn other behind the head design earphones that were much more comfortable."
5,"Finally, some REAL talent...","If you appreciate vocal talent and song-writing finesse, ""Ensename"" is your album. Whether you're into Spanish-language music or not, you will get into the rhythms, melodies, arrangements, instrument-combinations, and the incredible voice and guitar of Orlando Salinas. You can hear the good and bad of an amazing life-history, in this young man's voice. It will melt you, make you think, at times force you to dance, maybe cry, sing along, and really FEEL. And his amazing guitar talent makes Carlos Santana step aside. Stop looking; you've found the hottest talent, and album, in the industry today."
5,childhood memories revived,"It would not do justice to merely chew and digest this book (to borrow a cliched quote). Rather like a fine moist chocolate cake or cognac perhaps, swirl forever and drench in its vivid flavours. Being son of a Bengali expatriate family myself, AC's narrative about a small boy's summer vacations in Calcutta are not just beatifully picturesque but also remarkably coincident with my own recollections of similar surroundings from many years past. The description of life as a graduate student in a foreign country and of the institution of arranged marriages are similarly revealing. One just hopes that his future novels have a storyline to match his prose."
2,Bengali schmaltz leaves bad aftertaste....,"Chaudhuri's prose may be poetic but it is also insidiously sentimental. A saccharin-sweet view of Calcutta that leaves you craving for something more substantial. For great Indian writing try the salty, wry humour of Rushdie or Arundhati Roy's beautiful 'God of Small Things', a book that is not afraid to examine the darker side of post-colonial India."
2,Beautiful Prose but No Plot,"I picked up this book b/c I enjoy reading about life in other cultures. I agree with the other reviews that his writing is beautiful and descriptive, but there is no real plot. You can only read about every minute detail of a house or a typical day for so long until you want some sort of conflict or even character development. It is written in third person, so you never know what's going on inside their mind. There is no bonding with any character. I agree with the review that says it's just a glimpse into their everyday life that is disguised behind beautiful prose. I did not finish this book."
4,"mon, dis is real good Proustian stuff, mon","i read dis book two time, mon, and it be a quiet triumph of post-Proustian delicate psychology and description. de many caesuras give one pause--in all de appropriate places, mon. you want read dis book slow-slow; de most wonderfully delicious novella be de Oxford one, mon--""Afternoon Raag."" it make me want become writer too--especially if one can be having de two girls at same-time, mon. dat sound like de life!"
3,Picturesque,"It's poetic, it paints a picture... but it doesn't have much of a plot. How's the for some ""p"" words? I enjoyed it and Chaudhuri does have an eloquent turn of phrase, but I'm still kind of wondering what the point was. It seemed more like snapshots of the lives of Indian families than actual novellas. Freedom Song is a collection of three novellas: A Strange and Sublime Address, An Afternoon Raag, and Freedom Song. I dunno... maybe they're all just too smart for me (that is entirely possible)."
3,"""Jeeves"" A Resurrection?","Does any Andrew Llyod Webber fan remember his only failure ""Jeeves"" a musical written a year after the premiere of ""Jesus Christ Superstar."" ""Jeeves"" ran for about 30 performances and was a major disaster for Webber. No the show is not a ""rock opera"" but a musical based on the life of Bertie Wooster. In 1995 Webber revived ""Jeeves"" into ""By Jeeves"" and added a few songs. Throughout the musical, their is a constant pattern of song-dialogue-song-dialogue etc. The plot is stupid and the only song that is enjoyable is ""Banjo Boy."" Because the show discusses the lifestyle of a rich British family, I had a difficult time trying to connect with the themes presented in the plot."
5,A ripping good time!,"Quite possibly the most lighthearted of all the A.L. Webber musicals, this lesser known gem is worth getting, especially if you're a P.G. Wodehouse fan. But even if you're not, keeping up with the story is made easy because the sparklingly funny dialogue mixed in with the songs gives shape to the piece. Steven Pacey is perfect as the hapless, clueless Bertie, and his exuberant rendition of the upbeat ""Travel Hopefully"" is remarkably addictive. Other highlights for me included ""That Was Nearly Us,"" and the chortle-inducing hysteria of ""It's A Pig!"" While the score is not as lush and extravagant as shows such as Phantom or Evita, its more restrained and intimate nature suits its amusing subject material perfectly. I couldn't recommend anything more refreshing!"
4,KEEP THAT DANCE MUSIC COMING CHER,As I expected this re-mix is good. A little too much music that looses the vocals in places. Buy it if you love that techno-dance beat 130 bpm.
5,SIMPLY BREATH TAKING!!!!,"A Strong follow up to massive hit Believe. Cher has done it again, and looks like she's sure to hit the #1 spot again. Two diverse mixxes by Club 69 & Mark Andrews(my fav) offer a club style sure to fit anyones taste"
5,coooool!!!!!!! TOY!!!!!!,this toy is soooo cool. the food looks real. loved the stickers .the cash registeropens just like a real one. i love this toy!.if i was a mom i woul buy this toy .thats why my dad bought me this toy and for no reason!.except that i had to get good grades.but i get good grades anyways.anyway this toy has a shopping cart ryan it also brings money and coins this toy is the best. so BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Got it on Sale or wouldn't have bought it,"My daughter loves the barbie that isn't part of the fashion world, but more of the domestic diva. Thus, I thought this would be a perfect match. The only part of the toy that still gets play is the shopping cart and all the mini grocery items that come with it. The cash register, produce scale, and grocery shelves have made their way into the toy abyss (the closet). If you can catch this on sale (a good sale) and your daughter loves the domestic diva barbie this is an okay buy. If not, save the money for a more interesting set--vet, dog hotel, house, car. It is a good idea and wish there were more sets of this nature, but this set was not up to my expectation, not alot of fun, and kind of flimsy."
3,Pay close attention to the Size,"My wife and I were looking for a ""realistic"" shopping cart and ""store"" for my 3 yo daughter who likes to play store. I did NOT pay attention to what this was an ordered it thinking it was my daughters height. Boy was I wrong! This is an additional item for this toy line and is about the size of a small box. It is perfect for your little people and/or Barbie to play, but not good for playing store with your kids. I agree with the other reviews that it appears durable, but pay attention to what you are buying and what you need it for."
1,flimsy,"The pull-out spray doesn't fit well into the base, pulls out too easily (even when cleaning). When you move the faucet from side to side, the spray spout wiggles a bit; not solidly seated. Moen is sending another heavier weight to put on the hose under the sink. Why do they even sell a product that needs an immediate fix. If that doesn't work, I'll return the whole thing."
1,Terrible quality - replaced after 6 months,"I bought this faucet on the strength of Moen's name, but almost immediately regretted it. The way the faucet is designed, it loosens each time it is swiveled. I needed to repeatedly tighten it. If I made it tight enough to stay in place, it was barely moveable.Almost every part of the faucet is plastic. It feel lightweight and cheap. After a few months, there was visible wear at the point the pull-out faucet fits into the sleeve, and shortly after that the pull-out part became loose and wobbly.I just replaced this piece of junk with a Kohler."
4,Not Bad At All,I am always skeptical about books like this. Most of the ones I have come across are usually pretty cheesy or so impractical. While this doesnt get five stars there is enough useful material here that it was actually worth getting.The only thing better I have seen is The Romantic's Guide.
1,Useless. Utterly useless.,"I bought this book because I was very impressed with another Thompson book. ""Beginning C++ game programming."". Unfortunately, this tome doesn't live up to that high standard.I almost never use the CDs that come with programming books. As I prefer to type in the lessons myself. However I was forced to pop in the CD on the first chapter of this book when my code would not compile. Imagine my surprise when I opened the solution and saw ""if( PeekMessage( &msg;, NULL, 0U, 0U, PM_REMOVE ) )"" where the book had told me to type ""while (GetMessage(&msg;, wndHandle, 0, 0))"". Huh?It didn't get any better after that. The text is poorly written. The editing is abyssmal. Maybe it gets better later on, but I'll never know. Because I'm not going to waste any more time on this piece of garbage."
2,Don't waste your time,"The code examples in this book simply do not work. You have to rely on other books and looking up things yourself on the internet to get the examples working. If I wanted to do that, I wouldn't have bought THIS book!! Its thourogh in its coverage of DX9, but so are a lot of other books that have code that actually compiles. Don't waste your money. A programming book with programming examples that don't actually work is like a cookbook without any actual recipes. Useless."
2,Old Edition,"This is a book that teaches you directX 9b NOT 9c or 10. If you use the new 2005 Visual Studio the code may not compile, but with a few fixes it is still possible. The code on the CD is understandable if you read the chapter, but you need at least a good understanding of C++. So I recommend you look for a newer edition and get a book on beginning C++ as well."
2,>:(,"What can I say people have said it in these other reviews this book gives you a bigger headach then ever. I first bought the C# version, which this book turn out to be liek that the code it self is full of holes and it's a big mess. This book is not for beginners as the title stated it will just bring you down into a bigger hole."
1,Sadly awful,I was expecting to find more information and hopefully some images of the magnificent work of cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa. I paid more than 5 dollars for a single page with no valuable material on it. It seems to be a press release announcing the launch of a website.
2,Not What it Appears,"Don't let the 'B.B. King"" plastered all over this fool you. In this entire film, B.B. performs 3 songs. This is a film about the producers trying to do a show at Sing Sing Prison. Although not the greatest, it still held my attention. If you're a B.B. fan, save your money and watch the clips on Youtube. They're all there. Otherwise, this is pretty much your standard early seventies documentary/concert film with Joan Baez getting most of the screen time."
3,"yes- a good first novel, but not worth my time","Of the eight members of our book club, I am the only one who did not enjoy this book.I found myself being as critical as Jasper, the main character, would have been about this puffed up piece of ____.Docx did a nice job of weaving in Donne's work which made me want to revisit his poetry. As far as plot and characters, it played out like a made for TV movie. Docx's writing style reminded me of literature class - trying to hard. It went along, tat-tat-tat, then I think he grabbed a thesaurus and scoured it, then back to tat-tat-tat, thesaurus...Mid-way through the book, Docx seemed to become a little more comfortable and his style was more enjoyable. Unfortunately, by that point I already was completely annoyed.I expect Docx's sophomore effort will flow much better."
4,Love's Labors Lost,"Ripping good love story that nails much of the singles dating scene in any big city, not just London. In addition to making one laugh out loud while reading in public, it is an easy introduction to John Donne's poetry. Every man that has ever played the seducer will see some of himself and squirm but it makes you wonder if Huxley was right?Folly is often more cruel in the consequences than malice can be in the intent.Aldous HuxleyComplete Essays: Volume IV, 1936-1938"
4,Thoroughly enjoyable!,"Docx writes a real entertaining book here. Jasper is a memorable narrator who had me laughing out loud at times. He is aware of his own weaknesses, even as he enjoys sharing his techniques of capturing women and slowly falls in love for the first time. The scenes defining his calligraphy reveal a craftsmen who clearly enjoys his work.The poetry is the center of the book and Docx resorts to an ending filled with twists to bring Donne out. More than the the surprises about Madeleine which Docx builds to, the suprises about Donne and Jasper's relationship with Donne were the more convincing.I enjoyed the ending, but some readers may not dig it. Hope to read more about Docx and Jasper.4 and a half stars."
4,Read If You Like Writing,"Quite enjoyed this story. Jasper's world is fully detailed and makes you truly get to know the character. The narrator is truthful and doesn't pull any punches. The supporting cast of characters are memorable and amusing. Loved that the poems he is writing are specifically referenced and play a thematic role in the story.This novel was finely written and uses precise language, so often lacking in more mainstream novels. If you are a fan of well written stories then this is for you."
2,No charm.,"The characters in this novel lack both charm and warmth, and it is after all a comedy. Obviously, most readers (14 of 14 reviewers) felt this was a small price to pay for the wit and literary by-play, and occasional funny scenes. For me, the main character, Jasper, was a one-dimensional bore."
2,Not a real soundtrack of the film,"This CD is very disappointing - we saw the film 'Wag the Dog' and very much enjoyed the songs written especially for the film, such as 'American Dream', 'Courage, Mom' and 'Old Shoe'. We expected to find these songs on the film soundtrack album, and cannot understand why a CD has been released, purporting to be the official Wag the Dog soundtrack, which does not contain the songs used in the film."
2,Disappointing,"As others have noted, this so-called soundtrack includes none of the iconic songs from the movie. While the music here is fine, 29 minutes of instrumental music is not a ""soundtrack"" and the publishers should be embarassed to have labeled it as such. Very disappointing."
1,"""Deceptive"" to call this a Soundtrack","All the best music from the film is glaringly missing. Willy Nelson's work, plus ""Good Old Shoe"", ""Courage Mom"", ""The American Dream"", (We Are The World"" spoof), plus ""God Bless the Men Of The 303"" all moronically left out. This is not a Soundtrack but just a brief representation of Knopfler's own music from the film. NOT worth the money. All of the best has been gutted out!!"
1,The recognizeable songs from the movie are MISSING!,"I bought this so called soundtrack for ONLY one song, Merle Haggard's ""Courage Mom"". It's not on the CD and neither are Willie Nelson's cuts. Grrrr...there are 24 minutes worth of worthless tracks on this CD. One track with inaudible lyrics and 7 others that sound like elevator music. I would give this ZERO stars, but the default is 1-5. Total rip-off!"
2,Missing much - not a soundtrack,"I love the music on this album, but am very upset (like others here) so much of the good and fun music in the movie isn't here. Certainly it wasn't a space consideration. Definitely not a sound track. Definitely a *short* collection of knoffler's work done for the movie. Calling it a soundtrack is most misleading."
1,Where are the songs? Where's the music from the film?,"This isn't a soundtrack. If you were expecting to hear the great songs, you won't find them. I wanted to hear the great songs from the film and they just aren't here. Too bad, because the rest of the music would have received much better reviews if the most memorable music was featured.Not worth even a borrow from the library."
4,Definitely has its Moments,"Working on It continues to be, along with Theme of Laura, from the soundtrack to Silent Hill 2, one of the most memorable underplayed and evocative pieces of music I've ever heard.It is true that many songs from the movie are not featured here, but that is intended to be reflected on the price tag, which has been lowered.For those of you who want the bluesy song ""Good Ole Shoe"" heard in the film, check out Edgar Winter's ""Winter Blues."""
1,Free Willie!,"As the other reviews noted, the Willie Nelson tracks are missing. After watching this movie again, I found myself humming those songs in my head. It's an outrage that they're not here. ""Good Old Shoe"" was my favorite. I frankly don't even remember any of the rest of the songs on this disk."
3,Convenient and fun. Live tracks offer value but....,"...the true CT kharma resides in the first 4 releases: Cheap Trick, In Color, Heaven Tonight and Budokan."
1,doesn't do this great band justice,"The problem with box sets is that they cover the entire spectrum of an artist including their worst material,not to mention a bunch of hit or miss bsides. that is the problem with this box set. disc 4(or is it 5?)consist of all of their mid to late eighties over produced adult top 40 edgeless safe radio friendly stuff.not to mention whoever made the song list forgot ""downed"",""he's a whore""""stiff competition""""california man"" ""look out"" and many more.there were so many songs left off that they could have included instead of that wimpy disc 4!i suggest make your own box set that includes self title,in color,heaven tonight,at budakon and dream police,that is all you need!"
4,"Big sound, big fun.","This set includes all of the must-have cuts and many new Trick experiences. For those who love the early albums, there's a lot of material from them; for those who like Cheap Trick live, there's stuff on here they've not heard anywhere else. The booklet on the band is nicely done, the photos on the c.d.s themselves are cool, and the case is nice. ""Sex America Cheap Trick"" is a stupid title, and one doesn't need a bass player's commentary on live political questions of sexual morality. Still, this is a set to recommend to anyone who either 1) likes melodic, guitar-driven rock 'n' roll (a better version of The WHO -- I've seen both groups live, and Cheap Trick is as much superior to Townshend and Company in person as it is on record); or 2) went to high school and college in the '70s, '80s, or both. Buy it, you'll like it!"
4,"Very Good, but for fans only","Cheap Trick was in their heyday in the 70's any album they made during that time is an essential purchase. The 80's songs we're mostly hit or miss(unfortunately they missed more than they hit). The 90's saw them return to the charts, but as a pop-rock act. That basically describes the box set. The first two CD's are very good, taking mostly from their 70's albums and unreleased tracks(some now available on the CD reissues). The third CD taking mostly from their 80's material is hit or miss but does have a few suprises in the unreleased material. The fouth CD is probably the most passible of the four but does have a few good songs on it. My only big complaint is that their cover from the John Lennon tribute album ""Cold Turkey""(the best song on that album) is not on it. Like I stated it is only for fans of Cheap Trick, the curious should check out either the 70's albums, preferably the first three, or even the Authorized Greatest Hits album."
4,Very Irresistible Perfume by Givenchy,It is great perfume but the lid to the bottle was broken. It was a christmas gift so it was embarassing to give to my daughter. They do not allow returns either so I was very disappointed paying that much money and having no recourse.
1,fake parfum,fragrance in bottle not original..No wonder it's sold cheaper...but why waist your money for fakes??...
3,Worth One Viewing,"Undead or Alive is exactly what it says on the cover - a Zombedy. But it is not nearly as good as Shawn of the Dead because they (South Park team) go too far on the Comedy and give short order to the Zombie side. As the DVD extras tell, the director is a fan of zombies, but outsourced his zombie gore to another firm.He also outsourced the zombie script too. As a western-comedy it is pretty funny. As a zombie-comedy it is lacking."
5,Great,Now this is how a zombie movie should be made. I wish all zombie movies had this stuff in them.
4,An offbeat zombie flick,"A unique blend of three genres: comedy, western, and horror. Or more simply a western zombedy which changes a few rules of zombie folklore. These zombies talk, have goals and agendas, ride horseback, love their undead relatives and hate their live enemies. Very entertaining with more laugh-out-loud moments than shrieks of terror."
3,Welcome to Zom...er Dry Gulch,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this one. A low budget western zombie picture starring B-level actors had me suspecting a huge bomb, but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. Whether this is due to the movie being entertaining or merely a beneficiary of zero expectations I am not certain. James Denton seemed authentic as a seasoned western soldier, Chris Kattan wasn't as annoying as he could have been, and Navi Rawat was easy on the eyes if not a very convincing Native-American. The effects were decent for a low budget film and wisely used its cheap cgi as little as possible (mostly some explosions.) I have to say that that the ending caught me a little off-guard with enough of a twist to be surprising, but not entirely out of left field. Undead or Alive is a decent enough picture if you like zombies, westerns, and comedies but not necessarily in that exact order or combination."
5,"One of the best ""zomedy"" movies I have ever seen!","This movie has it all...booze, hookers, cowboys, Indians, and...zombies! The only draw back is that James Denton does not take his clothes off."
1,A Badly Written Film,"This movie wasn't as funny as I thought it might be with Chris Kattan in the lead. The end of this movie was poorly written and very much against women. I didn't like the fact that Luke(Chris Kattan), was more broken up about his horse being eaten than the fact that he was going to have to eat the new love of his life to break the zombie curse placed upon him. And I don't believe for a second that Sue(Navi Rawat), had to die. And neither Luke nor Elmer felt very bad that they had just eaten a human being to save themselves. Very poor writing."
3,UNIVERSAL WESTERN COLLECTION,"91 minute western, released in February, 1948, screenplay from a novel by Luke Short entitled Dead Freight For Piute. Stagecoach and freight film, or ""greed and revenge in the wild west"", with one Armin fighting another Armin. Filmed at Iverson Ranch, Los Angeles and Sedona, Arizona.Elder Armin played by George Cleveland and younger by Scott. Lon Chaney Jr. is elder Armin's henchman. No explanation why? Cleveland played part wheel chair, it worked well with script. Good ole, fairly sterotypical western fare but well worth watching. If you like westerns, will not be bored though script is like so many others.Good color (cinecolor) and good cast."
3,Just ok,I bought it at walmart for [...] bucks. And it was really predictable. nothing to write home about. But all in it was ok.
3,Can Your Get past the Absurdities?,"Can you get past a badly misplaced formula plot to enjoy a generic Randolph Scott western with good acting?I couldn't but maybe that's because Albuquerque is my home. Nearby silver mines? An ANGLO running the city? A rough frontier town in the late 1800's? Monumnet Valley scenery?Where were the genteel Hispano elite who ran an old and charming city on the Rio Grande? Where were the transportation hub of yore, the Sandia Mtns., the bosque, Old Town? Hollywood just wrote a script and chose an 'exotic' western name to plug in. I never did get past that.Too bad, as the subbort cast (hayden, Gabby Hays, Lon Chaney, Jr.) do a good job backing up Scott and the technicolor is nice.Editing and directing are passable, although the plotline is eminently predictable.Maybe Scott or western completists need this film."
5,Thorough Guide to Fashion Drawing,"This book is a thorough guide for learning the art of fashion design illustration. The book features a plethora of examples to teach how to draw faces and poses in correct proportion, as seen in professional fashion illustrations. The examples in the book are large, facilitating the use of tracings prior to free-hand drawing. Anyone who wants to learn fashion design, especially teenagers interested in the field, will find this book an invaluable asset."
2,Figure Drawing for Fashion Design Review,"I was abit disappointed in this book, I found the illustrations quite old fashioned with an 80's vibe, not what I was expecting. Even the clothes in the illustrations had Dallas style shoulder pads. I'm studying fashion design in college, so I was expecting to be inspired, through the use of different media and rendering techniques, which unfortunately didn't happen. But some of the templates for poses are useful and it would be ok as a starting point."
5,Figure Drawing for Fashion Design (Pepin Press Design Books),"This book is full of graphics and excellent information about drawing the fashion figure. I teach fashion design and illustration and I recommend this to anyone, beginner or intermediate!"
4,Fantastic Book,"I've been drawing since I can remember, and many can tell you that mastering the perfect female form is difficult. This book really helped me understand the female form so much better, and has inspired new fashion desgins for me to work with. Product arrived as expected in the promised form. Very happy with this purchase and I suggest this book for the upcoming fashion artist."
2,Better off taking a fashion sketching class,"I bought this book because I *just* wanted templates. (I know that as a designer, my strong suit is not in fashion sketching like this, never has been- but sometimes you have to.)What this book provides is more of a how to create the bodies you want based off of the 9-head model. For some, this is great- a classroom in the book. For me, who has been working in this field for a long time and I just needed to crank some bodies out without putting in (for me) an excruciating ammount of work, it fell short.Also, the proportions of the bodies are a little strange and the hand placement a bit rough. I spent more time fiddling with more natural hand positions on the templates than actually drawing the garments on them.It is a good book for those who can't attend an actual sketching course, but if you're looking for templates- good luck."
3,Nice pictures,"I got this book and was not thrilled. It has some nice pictures, but they don't teach much about drawing. There is also nudity for no real reason. Some of the illustrations look more pin-up than fashion. I find most of the illustrations very short waisted."
3,Cute and funny at times.,"Production and acting was better than 90% of the lesbian videos I've seen. One bedroom scene that I remember, nothing crazy - PG-13. Made me laugh. So, I would recommend it for entertainment, but not if you are hoping to provoke a mood of romance."
2,Rather colourless,"I thought this book would be about the non-mathematical lives of famous mathematicians, and I was not proven wrong. The problem is that it is a compilation of one-paragraph anecdotes of many matehmaticians' lives, which makes for good coffee table reading and not bedtime reading. There is very little substance to any of the lifestyles of any of the characters.The accounts themselves relate to the famous and not-so-famous, but many of them are questionable as to whether they actually deserve to be in this book as they are may times simple accounts of a person's daily life - chronicling the events that happen to many of us on a daily basis.I summary the stories are too brief and there are other (better) factual books on the real lives and histories behind mathematics and mathematicians."
4,not to bad,"yeah,this cd has got a nice feel to it,but ive heard alot of extaordinary drum n' bass. This cd feels futuristic, yet somewhat concrete. It's got a sweet feel to it, it's just a bit repetitive. If this cd had plenty of breaks in each track i'd probably give it 5 stars. Check out ltj bukems Logical Progression, thats the most spellbounding drum n' bass, You'll never get tired of it!"
3,Popular Drum 'n' Bass is not the best.,"Probably the most popular drum 'n' bass album around these days, it has truly made a mark and furthered the way for drum 'n' bass than any other album, but it is not the best. The first CD in this double album does contain a few good tracks including the excellent brown paper bag, but contains too much vocal and is too repeatitive. The second CD is a true drum 'n' bass CD and makes the album worth owning. Another mark in the advancement of drum'n'bass is LTJ Bukem's Logical Progression, which is truly fit for two CDs."
2,half empty,"these cds are meant for a club full of really bad dancers who need the same beat over and over and over again. this double cd is more like one remixed single, with a variety of nice hooks. what is really amazing is that this cd killed drum and bass. i cannot/willnot forgive them."
2,Eh....,"I bought this album hearing words like ""jazzy"" and ""innovative"". I found little to none of these words in the album. Loop after loop your waiting for something.On some songs you get it, but most you dont. Roni Size may be a great drum n bass artist, but I wouldnt go as far to call him innovative. There's too many clones out there, Lets move on......."
3,Overrated,"A few standout tracks buried in a generally uninspired album. If you're looking for something truly innovative and ""jazzy"" try on Amon Tobin for size."
5,Amazing,"""New Forms"" was, is, and always will be the best Drum N Bass album out there.Its not easy listening, its not very dancable, it is just pure music, and - I am afraid it sounds cheesy - it is really art. Its Jazzy, funky, very smooth, minimalistic, and its so subtle that you cannot express its quality in words.Just let me tell you, you have to spend a little time on it - many songs are over 8 minutes long - but once you warm up to the album, you will listen to it over and over again, and you will find somthing new everytime you put it on.This is as much 5 stars as it can get."
5,Four words sum this up: Everyone needs a copy!,"A supurb albumn, which in it's double format, shows a depth which fewer and fewer modern albumns reach. From the fast and furious Share the Fall, to the peaceful Watching Windows, no track fails to satisfy. Each track is worthy of it's place. AND if like me you have seen it performed live, you appreciate it even more!"
3,OK album,"I think this album is generally overrated. A lot of is is boring and there are too many overused instrument samples. However there are a bunch of ass-kicking songs that balance it out (like hot stuff , brown paper bag, and railing). I would have said 5 stars for sure if the lower 50% of tracks were thrown out and 1 disc was released instead of 2. In short, decent, but not worth it."
3,"Good, but too drawn out.","I like this pairing of jazz and techno that a lot of people are working with. I think these guys are really talented and they certainly come up with some great tracks, but too often I was reaching for my remote to flip to the next song. The songs just go on for too long!They need to let the tracks develop as they continue. For most of these tracks, by the time you're three minutes into the song you've heard everything you're going to hear and yet you're only halfway to the end!Goldie and Grooverider do this better, but I'd still give these guys another chance. They clearly have talent and can make some really nice atmospheric and sparse music. And somebody needs to get Bahamadia a serious record deal - she is the bomb and has great taste in who she works with!!!"
2,What is all the fuss about?,"The thing that strikes me the most when I listen to this album is the fact that every track seems to be a unfinished work in progress. Aside from a notable few, most of the songs seem to consist of the same Hi-Hat, Snare, and kick drum line cut and pasted under a repetative 4-note bass line. Not one track on the album seems to move anywhere, and very few have any kind of charcter. Dull and uninspired."
1,"Wow, what a disappointment.","Ok, I've only heard a few songs from this Dj, so I finally decided to check out one of his CDs and see if he's as good as his hype. This CD does nothing but reminds of why I should of kept my $20. Railing is the only thing worth listening to. Other than that, just walk past this album and look for something better."
3,hmm... not what youll expect,"if youre a nora roberts fan this isnt one of the ones youll flock to. she plays it low key in this one. theres not the normal ""romance"" in this that you would find in the others. so if youre looking for a steamy read this really isnt going to tap that area. not bad though"
5,A Great Start!!!!!,"If you are a first timer to the lab setting as I was 3 yrs ago, this is a great book to have as a reference. Kathy Baker covers lab etiquette, lab lingo, bacteria, mammalian cells, DNA, RNA and safety. Everything a good lab technician should know. Diagrams give you insight to unfamiliar equipment and she provides notable references if you need more information. The great thing about this book is that it provides you with the basic tools you need to get started at a low cost. Once you have read this book you'll be ready to take on more in depth literature without hesitation."
4,Recipes even your kids will love!,This book is chockfull of recipes that are quick and easy to make - plus even my picky 10 year old will eat them. The only reason I didn;t give it 5 stars is that I think it could have been printed a little nicer. The ink ran a little when I got one of the pages wet. So just be careful about those splats. Otherwise this is a great cookbook to add to your family's collection.
3,A Good Start,"After loving her later cookbook, Saving Dinner, I hoped this cookbook would be more of the same. However, I was disappointed. There are some good recipes, but this book contains fewer main dishes. The number of people the recipes serve vary, which means there is more adjusting. Delicious, nutritious meals are still Leanne Ely's specialty."
5,Finally a cookbook with good and easy recipes!!!,"Normally I do not bother to buy cookbooks because it seems that I'll spend $20 on a cookbook only to find that there are only 2-3 recipes in there that I would actually take the time to make and that my kids would eat. This is not the case with this cookbook however. I went through and was able to dog ear about 20-25 recipes that I have the time to make and that my kids and picky husband will eat. I haven't tried anything yet, but I have three I am trying out this week. I am so happy to finally have a realistic cookbook for those of us who aren't home baking pies all day!"
5,and the drugs don't work on this...,"as the music is so good, you just feel high! it is defintely one of the best dark house i ever heard. I love this label Global Underground, most of their staff is very good, particulary tenaglia and sasha. voila..buy it and let me know who u felt about it!"
4,Made in USA! Great kit :],"I bought this kit direct from Csonka and dealt with pleasant CSRs during the process.I was intrigued by the uniqueness of the product and the fact that it's made in the USA (so rare these days).The burgundy kit is a very nice, rich brown/red. Exterior is fairly supple and the kit has an overall sturdy heft to it. Feels like it has a metal shell as the skeleton.When you open the kit, you're greeted by an array of neat accessories: A ""silver"" clock (wish it were metal), a mini-humidor with dropper, an etched metal ashtray/storage case (seems to hold a pack of papers perfectly :), and two etched metal restraining bars to allow you to position your cigs and keep them held in. A small instruction/info sheet rounds it out. The inside is lined with a felt-like material.Great product and seemingly one-of-a-kind :]"
5,Scathing? Yup. True? Ditto.,I doubt if Mr Naipaul made many friends among black Africans with this book. It's really damning. But true. And tells you more about east africa than any textbook or research paper will. I'm an Asian living in Zimbabwe and whenever my black friends ask me why Asian girls don't go out with them I give them my xerox copy of chapter 3.
3,An interesting read,"I read this while living in Nairobi in the 1980's. It was ""the book whose name shall not be mentioned"" at the school where I was a teacher, for the headmaster described in the book was none other than my employer. He passed away sometime around 1987 but when he was still among us, the book served as the inspiration of many an evening's conversation.It is an interesting read in part because it was written during the transitional times from colonial east Africa to independence."
2,Too verbose and critical,"As an East African Asian, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it quite as much.The author is very cynical and sharply critical of almost EVERYTHING. It doesn't seem that he likes ANYTHING about East Africa.Also, he often provides more details than are necessary on mundane things, like unexpected meetings with strange people.Overall I would say that the author has done injustice to East Africa, and particularly the Asians of East Africa."
5,Like it!,Agree with other reviewers! It is a beautiful statue and has a calming presence. Came well packaged and arrived earlier than expected!
3,Very Little Respect from the Author,"I'm not a fan of Ross Perot, but Posner has no respect for him. If you read between the lines of this book, you'll see that Ross Perot is a fighter, inovator and gets what he wants(usually).Posner is continually making statements that make Ross Perot look like a dufe. (Is dufe a word?)It was an easy read and I learned a lot about Perot, if you read nothing else, read the last chapter which really shows that Ross has changed this country."
1,Posner went for the negative,"This book is full of left-handed compliments and has a decided bent toward the negative where Ross Perot is concerned. I have lost respect for Gerald Posner because of his mission to use the sleight of hand to cast Mr. Perot in the negative. This is not a fair or balanced view of an interesting, complex and heroic man. In a number of cases, where there is a choice to portray an event in either a good or bad light, it appears Mr. Posner always chooses the latter."
1,A Broken Record with Flawed Theme,"Never was I so relieved to complete a book. It read like a ""broken record"" that could not move beyond its place of being stuck in the grove of negativity. The ""behind-the-scene"" theme was an effort to discredit Mr. Perot by accentuating his idiosyncrasies, which amount to nothing, but under the scrutinizing and skewed microscope of Posner, Perot becomes a crazed man.Unfortunately, Posner has overemphasized Perot's fallibility and failed to bring out his humanness and humaneness. It is not a balanced book."
5,"Perfect, no kidding","If you love Jazz or just love great musical compositions, then Straight, No Chaser will become an instant favorite. Even if you have heard Straight, No Chaser, years ago, this updated reissue is something very special to the ears. Beautiful playing all the way around. Recording quality that will make you feel very good and tunes that will put bounce in your heart. Timeless Jazz that will quickly confirm why some people say that in Jazz, and music in general, never has there been anyone like Thelonius Monk. The other great thing about this CD is that it is a great value. Here is a whole lot of music and not a single cut will you want to skip over. Pop this in your player and be pleased."
5,Get the SACD version!,"This is, of course, a classic recording. But if you REALLY want to hear this music at its best, you should definitely consider getting the SACD version.... It makes even the most recent redbook CD reissue of ""Straight, No Chaser"" sound like an AM radio broadcast being amplified through a megaphone. Of course, you'll need to get an SACD-compatible player, but there's currently no better way to enjoy this wonderful recording!And if you don't believe it, you probably haven't heard it..."
2,Rank at best,"Heard this group for the first time tonight 1/2/10. My thoughts. 1. Too many in the group. Should be 5 Max for true ACapella. Arrangements, Average at best. Simply not impressed. I'm from a well known group so i'm speaking from my expertise if you will. Theres more i can add, but i think i'll leave it at that for now.Rick CManhattan Transfer"
4,Yeah Monk!,"This is great, including four of Monk's most stellar performances. You've got a superlong remake of the title track, one of his most famous songs, which is most certainly great listening; the mid-tempo, bluesy Locomotive, I Didn't Know About You (an Ellington cover, can't really go wrong with those), and the lengthy but fascinating Japanese Folk Song. Some issues, though: Monk's one of the best-ever pianists, but I've always preferred it when he worked with a small group to when he went solo - hence, the two unaccompanied piano solos, both standards (Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea; This Is My Story, This Is My Song) are easily the album's only two weak moments. And while I'm perfectly okay with We See, the fact is that it's a bit too long for its own good.Classic release though, make sure you have this in your Monk collection."
4,No one can beat the master...,"This fabulous collection of standards and new, unrealesed masterpieces by Theloniuos Monk is one of the better ones that I have heard. While nothing can top actually being there yourself, this comes awfully close! This collection is better for those who have heard Monk before, they will have a better apreciation for the history and the music as a whole."
4,Great Comeback,This comeback album reminds the listener of the greatness of the Bee Gees and sometimes even approaches former glory. Tracks 8 and 3 are my favorites. Listern to this one at the store and make up your mind to get it!
3,Quite a Comback,"Bee Gees had been sort of neglected from the US since You Win Again, and this comeback startled the US CHart with Alone. This album features very emotional songs.1. Alone - Barry's fake voice startled the whole song, with Robin's sweet voice in the middle of the song.2. I Surrender - Absolute rock song.Great show of natural harmony, with mixes.3. I Could Not Love You More - Changed back to the old-time ballad style, but gradually changed to rock. Barry's solo.4. Still Waters Run Deep - Main chorus shows absolute harmony, performed in One Night Only as bonus track.5. My Lover's Prayer - Robin's fantastic solo. Later produced as a CD Single with Cliff.Other songs are not as remarkable other than Closer Than CloseCloser than Close - Maurice Solo, went to US 46.A good start with the few starting songs, but eventually become boring album like 2 Years On."
3,Not as bad as I rembered it,"having just listened to it again for the first time in a couple of years but it certainly doesn't merit all these 5 star reviews. With all the different producers working on this album you'd think that at least one would get it right. The vocals have a heavy echo then on top that the music is echoed again which may have sounded alright if the album had come out on vinyl but on CD with Barry Gibbs high voice it sounds tinny. There are a few good lyrics on the album but most of the songs are sugary love songs, perhaps they should have renamed the album stagnent waters. Still it does have some good moments like I Will and My Lovers Prayer hence the 3 stars."
4,About time!,"When this CD came out..they where way over due in my opinion! Really good to hear them shift back to the style that drew me to them to begin with. Could tell by writings of these songs they felt more grounded.Buy this w no fear of regret if you like their older stuff, this is just modernized up more, and very well done!"
4,"Easy, often Jazzy","Still Waters was very different from most of their earilier recordings, which shows how an artist(s) can grow and change as it's audience changes. I particularly love I will, My Lover's prayer, and I Surrender. This CD has a smooth, mellow flow which I find refreshing. It just goes to show how great people and how smooth an artist can get as perfection goes on."
3,shipping cost more then the cd,cd looked like it was one of the first to be made but played nice case was all yellowed and looked dusty
2,Spirits having flubbed.,"The first two songs on the album, ""Alone"" and ""I Surrender,"" suggest that great things are to come, but unfortunately that's not the case. With the third track, ""I Could Not Love You More,"" the album bogs down into a series of ballads that suggest the Gibb boys are bound for Vegas. Only ""I Will"" manages to distinguish itself from the songs that come before and after it. Barry Gibb is using a breathy vocal that ranges from effective to annoying, while Robin's warbling is more pronounced -- and distracting. If the Bee Gees ever manage to produce an entire album free of such vocal affectations, they would probably find themselves back on top of the pop music world -- which is where they belong."
4,Really like this CD,"I had this on cassette and wore it out, so this crisp, clean CD was a great find. I would recommend it to my friends."
3,Little on the light side fabric wise,Little on the light side - but considering the price I paid - get a bunch and just change them out. Look great flying from out front of our store
4,Nice,My brother in law loved it since he is from Canada and really appreciated the quality and gesture. I would recommend it.
3,Pretty good,I ordered this for my friend for Christmas. It's a little thinner fabric than other flags I've bought (it's a little see through) but for its intended purpose it works
2,ripped,the metal loop ripped off other that.... great flag....it was very neat and very machine washabe the the the the
1,Damaged,"My product was mailed to me in excellent time. However, this item was a gift for a friend at work. When she opened the package for the first time, the flag had a large black oil stain right down the middle."
4,O' Canada,Flag was a good value and is hanging in my office to remind me of my 'home'. The item arrived in a timely manner and was a good value. Grandson needed it for a school project.
4,Cats eat it and hairballs reduced 90%,The cats seem to like it. The hair balls still occur once in a while. Need to give it more time to see what happens when the cats shed in the Spring.
2,Unexpected,"I ordered this book because I was intrigued by the work I have previously seen by Giger. When I got the book I skimmed through the artwork and some of the reading material. To my dismay, I found quite a few obscene images that are utterly grotesque. Bestiality is a truth of humanity and this is shown in a few of his images. It takes place in the world and I think Giger is the kind of artist that enjoys portraying the evils of our carnal nature. Which I find intriguing in itself. Giger is sick, but don't let the few pages with the hard to accept truths he portrays keep you from purchasing the book. He is still an amazing artist. His pieces are very intriguing and I love his work. There is a lot of beautiful artwork that is not so dirty. Just keep in mind that Giger is a sick puppy and involved in things ""Christians"" may not be too fond of. So buy with caution!"
1,Completely obscene.,"HR Giger's work is COMPLETELY obscene. Utterly gross imagery that should be screened and labeled as pornographic artistry. Completely dark,disgusting sleezy filth. I would not recommend Giger's work to anyone EVER as you will eventually be introduced to his filth. And yes I'm an artist/designer by career. His museum in Gruyere is a scar on the face of Switzerland and a disgrace. I feel so sorry that his museum has been placed right next to such a wonderfully spiritual Tibetan museum."
3,Nice book but kind of small,"I love National Geographic and its photos. This book is filled with great photos and descriptions but the book is really small.... I was thinking it would be more like a coffee table book which it would be if your coffee table is tiny. The print is small and I actually bought as a gift for my dad, but I'm not sure he'll be able to read much of it - even with his glasses.So while I do like the photos, I should have paid more attention to the dimensions. I just really had never seen a photo book, especially a hard cover Nat Geo one, so small. And yes, it does say it's 8""x6"" in the details but it just seems smaller, maybe because you want to see bigger images."
2,Disappointing_AWFUL,"National Geographic, who has given us so much wonderful photography and printing now gives us a tiny book, printed in China by non craftsmen. I worked in the graphic arts all my working life (40 years) and this book is pathetic and the printing is just downright awful. Shame on NGS for sending something out the gate like this. This is a disgrace to the name and the cause, sorry but true! The photographers must be pretty down and upset after seeing their Kodachrome masters destroyed in this fashion. AWFUL! If this was the result of my graphic arts work, I would think about finding a new career. It did not even make a good gift! NGS - you are damaging your reputation with this example of printing!"
2,Amazing photos - BUT VERY SMALL!,"I was very disappointed to receive this book in the mail. From the photos and the positive customer reviews, I was lead to expect a coffe-table sized book - large enough to give these astounding photos justice.However:1. this book is TINY - only about 6"" tall and 5"" across!!!2. small size does not allow for laying the book flat, which distorts most of the photos as most are spread over 2 pages3. the binding is so poor and low quality that I expect pages to start falling out after just a few times handling the bookDO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It is frustrating to look through the tiny photos and it has poor-quality binding. Look elsewhere for coffee-table books."
4,"a stunning portrait, well worth the price","i'm not sure what book 'foxboy' is reviewing. his comments that the book is 'tiny' and the printing 'awful' are puzzling. of course i bought this book 20 years ago when it was first released, so perhaps NGS has re-printed it as a substandard publication. However the other reviewers don't seem to think so. all i can say is the book that i have is neither 'tiny' nor 'awful', and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys the fine photography for which NGS is known. While the cover shot is arguably the most riveting photograph of all, there are many others that are equally enjoyable. i have displayed this book continuously since i purchased it. the cover is faded from twenty years of exposure to the light but i never tire of seeing those haunting green eyes."
4,photos,national geographic always has fantastic photos this book is small and easily carried in a bag which is handy if you are waiting somewhere
2,I was disappointed.,"I have never seen a more eaten up book in my life. The pages were printed at 3 degrees above level and it looks like they were later trimmed by a chain saw.The pictures were of decent quality and the writing was legible. Those are the only positive things I can say about this book. I am surprised that National Geographic would spent so much time and money gathering such quality photos and allow them to be seen in such a hideous manner. On top of that, they stamped their little yellow rectangle and their name right on the cover as if they had no shame in the world."
4,Great ideas,This book has alot of concepts and ideas that are useful for starting photographers. The pictures are great but the text are small. It is kind of small compared to other coffee table books but bulky since there's alot of pages.
2,Too small.. Thought this would be nice for the coffee table.. I was wrong.,Too small.. Thought this would be nice for the coffee table.. I was wrong. I do not recommend buying unless you check dimensions first.
5,Incredible,"This album is from a time when musicians were very creative, and didn't tour with large entourages of dancers, hairdressers, and wardrobe staff. If you like Carole King's music, this album is a must. The quality of the sound and the songs on the album are fantastic. It also features guest James Taylor. This is real music, not manufactured stuff which is now often the norm."
1,"THIS IS ""THE ROAD TO SUCCESS DVD"" .","BEWARE......If you already own Nickelback ""The Road to Success"", don't get this. Midnight Riders is the exact same DVD but in a different dvd case."
3,It's Good,"This is nothing special. This is just an interview with a hero. This disc puts you into the head of a hero and gives you a good idea of his persona. As I said, its nothing special, but a hardcore fan of Marilyn Manson will get a kick out of it."
4,Learning curve,"The glue is supposed to be for carpets, so that's why I bought this package. Don't know if regular hot glue would work, but this did work, though the learning curve for me is long, since I've not used regular hot glue much. Wish there was some metal tool to push the glued carpet down with, so I used a ball point pen...glue wants to stick to everything of course, and it's tricky."
3,Awesome Concept- DREADFUL line-up,"Ok, no doubt this dvd will be a cool piece of nostalgia. Who didnt love Mr. Perfect. The documentary will be cool- but thats where it ends.What the hell kind of match lineup is that? Nothing vs Flair? Perfect and Savage vs Razor and Flair? What about on Monday Night Primetime when he turned on Bobby Heenan? i dunno...great idea, absolutely craptacular match lineup."
3,"Good, but lacked.","Good dvd. Good matches. Good documentary. However, it allmost completely ignores Curt Hennig's drug problems. A small tidbit for maybe 30 seconds near the end mentions he died from a cocain overdose. I felt the dvd lacked the full honesty of Curt Hennig's life because it hid his drug use almost completely."
3,Not exactly perfect,"Great documentary, i just wish Mr. McMahon could have been involved. However, what idiot put together the match selection? He loses every one of them in the WWE, no sign of the great loser leaves wwe match with Ric Flair or his first wrestlemania and summerslam appearances where, god forbid, he actually won. Far from perfect..."
4,Pretty Good DVD,"Like prev. reviews have stated, the actual doc. does not run 90 min. It has alot of good extras, I happen to find five hidden videos, below is how to find them.Disc 1Under chapters highlight ""Mr. Perfect"" and keep hitting the ""Left"" arrow. you will then see a classic interview from the All Star Wrestling from December 13th 1987.Highlight ""Prankster"" keep hitting ""Right"" you'll see a short interview with Wade Boggs.Highlight the ""Rap is Crap music Video"" and keep hitting ""Right"" you'll then see a segment from WCW Thunder on July 1st 1999 where Curt and the West Texas Rednecks play the song live.Highlight ""Curt Loved Karaoke"" and keep hitting ""Right"" you'll then see a short clip of Chris Jericho talking about Curt.Disc 2Highlight ""Mr. Perfect vs. Hulk Hogan"" and keep hitting ""Left"" you'll then see a segment from the WWF where Curt distorys the heavyweight title with a hammer.All in all and great dvd to pick up, RIP CURT"
4,Touching and Excellent,"I always liked Mr Perfect/Curt henning while he was wrestling, and it was nice to see a lot of what was going on backstage and his life during the times I was watching him. Some good extras and excellent matches. WWE makes some excellent collections"
3,quite ok - if you like that sort of thing..,"McConnell's first was a novelization of the pilot episode. Now, I should admit my bias right away: I'm not a fan of novelizations in general unless they actually add to the story, and this one didn't. It just inserted the thoughts of the various characters through the episode(s), and hey -- we can do that ;) However, I think the author stayed mostly true to the characters, and it's fun to visualize the episode while you're reading. Probably the best of the bunch."
5,Stargate SG-1,"I have attempted to read some of the spin off books based on the sg-1 characters, but was having trouble getting into them. What I really wanted was a book that followed the episodes that I had already seen-This book follows the Stargate Sg-1 pilot episode almost exactly. Its a fast read and good for anyone who can't get enough of sg-1."
2,Not so great...,"I bought this because I love Stargate SG-1, and because I've enjoyed many of Ashley McConnell's books in the past. This one, however, was a disappointment. It seemed incredibly rushed, as though maybe she had a very short amount of time to write it and no time to edit it.Basically, it felt like nothing more than a transcription of the episode. Very little characterization, none of the things I'd expect in a novelization, like getting into their heads to see motivations or feelings. There were a LOT of mistakes with continuity and with editing, even some spelling mistakes! Overall, it was very disappointing. I gave it 2 stars, because it is still Stargate SG-1, and because there is a hint of Jack/Sam... other than that, it wasn't worth reading."
5,Amazing,"Yet again another glorious work by CLAMP. Their stellar artwork has given me cause to turn green with envy. This one was a shocker though, the ending was a suprise like none other. It leaves you acheing for the next ones in the series.And as always CLAMP gives us charecters to fall in love with. Woderful design and fight scenes. I can't recomend this book enough, but make sure you get 1 and 2 first. You wouldn't want to be confused by this amazing tale of monsters and magic"
5,MKR is awesome!!!,"MKR is a GREAT read! I recommend all three novels! Even if you don't like the plot, you'll REALLY enjoy the art! But the plot is great too, so why worry if it's bad or not? ^_^ It's fun, exciting, and it's full of laughs! From the hillbilly girl who isn't looking for a fight, to Zagato, the bad guy himself, you'll find yourself not wanting to ever put this book down so you can stay in the lands of Cephero forever! :)"
1,please,please only give recomondations of Mary-Kate and Ashley and all the sailormoon books or sailormoon anything that are not in my with list! ^_^
4,Avalon,This album I was not really excited about. Bought this because of Irish dancers but this is not one of Johns better albums. The album I got was in great shape but music was not inspiring.
2,pretentious pseudo classical silliness,"John Tesh seems like a nice enough guy, but his music stinks, quite frankly. Much of it sounds like figure skating music; some of it sounds like theme music for the local news. Why anyone would actually spend money and time on it, however, is beyond me."
4,Country gentleman: The Best of Ricky Skaggs,This was a gift for my Dad and he plays the CD's all the time! Loves the songs.
5,Exceptional Talent,There is not a song on this CD I don't like. I like all the recordings of Ricky Skaggs. He seems to choose great songs and I am pleased to see he is recording bluegrass again. What a Talent!
4,It's a Value,"I bought these for my wife. She decided to take up crochet as a hobby. She wanted to make scarves, blankets, etc. The three larger needles are good for this type of thing. She really won't use the smaller ones, but even based on the price of the three larger needles, it was still a good deal."
4,Honda Trunk,This Trunk serves the purpose for me. It has good space inside for things you need to carry. It is a bit noisy when you hit bumps in the road. It's easy to wire up. Not bad for the money.
3,happy but.........,"Great inexpensive trunk but had to replace the lighting kit before even installing on bike. Used radiantz led and have had no further problems, original lighting was just to cheap to even waste the time to install."
4,GRET,LOOKS GREAT EASY TO MOUNT PUT ON BACK OF MOTORTRIKE KITLOOKS LIKE IT WAS BORN THERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A real page-turner!,"The Quest for Gillian&#65533;s Heart is a fast-paced, compelling story filled with lusty, passionate characters. The exciting Viking hero and his fiesty Irish captive are great to watch as they, much against their own wills, fall in love.The obstacles of coming from very different cultures and the fierce competition from those who want the hero and heroine for themselves are difficult to overcome. The opposing forces don&#65533;t even stop at murder.The characters and the settings are real and believable. And Catherine Snodgrass&#65533; masterful writing has the reader pulling for Andor and Gillian until the satisfying ending.This novel is entertaining and well worth reading. It&#65533;s a keeper."
4,Mathis and Riddle,"I love this album. The ballads are lush with Nelson Riddle charts and Johnny is in fine voice performing a terrific line up of songs. I read the Nelson Riddle book and he expressed dissapointment with the results of their collaboration, but I find it to be, cut for cut, one of Johnny's best. You still can't beat ""Johnny Mathis Greatest Hits"", but that is a compilation album. Sample the recording of ""Stairway To The Stars"" and you will understand why I find, ""I'll Buy You A Star"" a great listening experience."
4,The Swingin' 60's,"Not quite what you expect from Johnny Mathis but wonderful none the less, with a bit of swing mixed in with some lovely ballads. Nelson Riddle is in a 60's mood here, with some angelic chorus backup for Johnny's upbeat tracks. Being a solid Mathis fan, my votes go with the ballads, and ""Oh How I Try"", ""Warm and Willing"" and ""Smile"" are worth the price alone. One of my all time favorite Mathis tunes ""Should I Wait?"" is a bonus track here and is an automatic Mathis classic."
2,I'll Buy You A Star,I did not think his songs were that good. He was one of the best around back when I was a boy and now different.
2,Average Vocals Unsuited to the Riddle Magic,"This album is a disappointing offering from a vocalist unsuited to the style and swing of the American standard songbook.The arrangements lack the sparkle of Riddle's best work and. although good by ordinary standards, do not sparkle in the same way as his work with greats of the genre: Sinatra, Fitzgerald, Cole, Garland et al.Mathis is poor on the uptempo tracks and he shows little understanding of the lyric and he lacks the snap of a dedicated swing artist.The ballad tunes are the best cuts but Mathis' vibrato style comes over as over-mannered and only the quality, shimmering arrangements elevate the songs from being completely ordinary.This kind of album was very popular in the late 50's / early 60's and Riddle was the best arranger of this kind of music in the book. Mathis, obviously feeling the need to jump on the bandwagon, fails to score with this effort and Riddle is not able to work fluently with this unsuitable vocalist."
3,"Nice out of the box, but...","Our new armillary was nice & shiny out of the box. We knew that sitting in the garden that it would weather, but after only one rain, it lost all of its luster and even took on a little rust! (brass?) We still like it & it is a nice addition to the garden."
4,Good product for the money,The only complaints that I have about this heating pad are that the control unit gets hot to the touch and that the cover is kind of flimsy. Otherwise it is a good deal for the money. It gets nicely warm and the gel pad conforms to your body and is comfortable.
5,An album full of home runs,"This is the most complete compilation album available for the boys of summer. It is full of hits. from the classics of the Play Deep, Bangin', and Voices of Babylon eras, to a couple of tracks from Daimond Days and Rockeye. There are also two previously unreleased gems on this album: It Should Have Been Me and Through The Years. Through The Years is a powerful ballad all about the lessons in love. It is possibly the most powerful ballad John Spinks has ever written. Also on this album are alternative versions of Alone With You and Somewhere In America as well as One Hot Country, which was featured on the soundtrack for the movie If Looks Could Kill. So if you are looking for one album that has all the Outfield hits plus some surprises, this is the album! Buy it!"
2,Best of the Outfield? I Think Not,"This album has a few good songs from their first couple of albums(""Play Deep"" and ""Bangin""), and has even has the somewhat interesting song ""Voices of Babylon"", but unfortunately the rest of the album is pretty generic. As this album stands, I really can't recommend it...the Outfield deserves a better compilation CD than this. Instead, my recommendation is to pass up this album and to just pay the extra few dollars and buy ""Play Deep"" and ""Bangin'"". Both these albums are usually offered together as a package deal on Amazon.com and can be found pretty cheap."
2,They struck out on this one!,"First of all, I'm a major fan of the Outfield. I saw them for the first time back in '86 at 6 Flags Atlantis, Ft. Lauderdale. Anyway...forget this album and just get the first two; Play Deep and Bangin'. Both those albums were played countless times, I swear I thought my car stereo would overheat from playin' them so much.I don't understand how ""No Surrender"" didn't make it onto this compilation. The remake of ""Alone with you"" is just lame. No comparison with the original on Bangin'."
5,GET IT!,"Geez, what can I say? This CD is the best buy, I mean for asmall price I got the best music I've ever heard in years, being fed up with this bubble gum music and indie stuff. Tony Lewis is like a good wine :) (love you, Tony!). From Play Deep to their recent release Extra Innings, his voice has gotten better by the years. I heard stories about The Outfield live performances, they said, ""if you haven't heard Tony singing live, you don't know what you're missing out on!"" This CD is a MUST-HAVE for all music lovers. Not just the Outfield-fans. It contains songs that sound even better the more you listen to them. Classics like Your Love, My Paradise, Alone With You and that soundtrack to the movie If Looks Could Kill: One Hot Country. Look, I turned a Blink-182 fan into an Outfielder practically overnight by lending him this CD and he went and tell all his teen friends that he had just heard ""this new cool band called the Outfield"". How old am I? Let's just say that I grew up in the early '80's."
5,You had to be there... Maybe not...,"If you didn't love the Outfield in the first place, why else would you buy their Greatest Hits CD? The only prerequisite - you have to appreciate good music. This trio from London has the Philly sound made so popular in the mid to late 80's. Don't try to adjust your stereo, three of the tracks on this CD are recorded in mono. The CD liner says ""...these mono versions showed off the performances and the songs themselves in the best light."" This seems to work for me.I saw the Outfield at one of their first shows in the U.S. This was the first concert I ever saw and The Outfield opened for the Hooters... who would have known..."
1,Just two good songs...,"This band just made the great deal issuing two major hits: ""Say It Isn't So"" and ""Your Love"".Both songs are included in this album. But beware: Some extra songs and 'new' hits just recorded in Mono. Most of them are just stuffing material... Dissapointing!"
2,Not all I thought it would be,"I had been on a nostalgic kick listening to my copy of Play Deep I've had since it came out. I was enjoying it so much I thought I'd order this disc to try out some of their tunes.Unfortunately I guess that nostalgia is all the music has that appeals to me, because I can't get into any of their other music. I found the tunes sort of generic. I would recommend to anyone thinking of buying this to try some of the tunes out first or just purchase Play Deep if you're only in it for the memories."
3,Not bad for the money.,"This is not a bad setup for the money. There is a little bussing when using the USB power for the Powered Bass, but you can us it without the power hooked up."
3,"Overrated, but good for the price I guess?","I'm not sure why people are giving this headset such great reviews... maybe it's the low price? They are NOT comfortable for more than 5 minutes on my average sized noggin. The sound quality is pretty comparable to most 'good' headsets. The vibrating bass feature is neat, but doesn't make up for the lack of comfort. They feel and look cheap, but they are. Maybe if I had a much larger head, they would sit better, but they feel like they are wanting to fall off and they don't do a good job of sitting on the ears comfy.I'll pass, paying an extra $10-15 for some Plantronics is worth it."
3,Sucks So Bad Do Not Buy,SUCKS SUCKS THERE HORRIBLE AND DO NO BUY SERIOUSLY GET TURTLE BEACHES I WANT MY MONEY BACK NOW MY FRIEND GOT A PAIR DIDNT EVEN WORK
2,Won't Last Long,"It's easy to use and the sound quality is good for its price. However, my ears begin to hurt after 30 minutes because the headsets are uncomfortable.But most importantly, I bought this on July 31st and it stopped functioning properly on October 1st. That means my headset only worked well for the first 2 months!! What's wrong with it? Sound is only coming out of one ear that's the problem. I need to move my wire around and have it at a certain angle just to get sound on both sides of the headset. That's annoying.I don't recommend this product. I recommend you save your money and get one of those expensive $80-100 headsets from brands like Steelseries, Razer, or Logitech. It' well worth it those things last years not months."
3,Decent,"This is a decent headset. I bought it cause it was cheap and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on one at the time. The bass vibration is a nice feature, although it is not as good as a sub-woofer and sounds rather fake. The mic tends to have a very loud consistent noise in the background that makes doing anything that you want to seem professional very difficult (I suppose you could play some mellow music in the background to mask the sound). The sound quality isn't the best (but it is decent), I tend to use my 2.1 speaker system over it, the sound sounds somewhat flat, like it lacks depth. The are not the most comfortable headset in the world, I get a pain in the top of my head after wearing it for about 20 minutes.I would recommend this headset to anyone who wants a cheap headset that is fun to mess with, it is rather fun to play with the bass vibration feature."
2,Disappointed,one side of the headsets gives broken sound effect. I might received defective piece but It may be the product itself. I am not satisfied with the product.
1,Caught fire burned my motherboard port aswell,Headset usb caught fire and melted. Ruined my motherboard usb ports and they were suppose to fix it. They never took care of me. Bad company so far
2,They are ok,"Overall, the sound is ok for $25 headphones. I am disappointed with the quality of the bass. There is definitely a lot of bass, if you want to call it that. It is as if they are manufactured to actually produce a 'vibration' on your head and it is annoying. The actual unit vibrates on your head while in 'normal' mode and prepare to be thoroughly annoyed when its in 'max' mode. I have been leaving it in off mode (no amplifier) and it sounds ok; however, when listening to softer music you hear a lot of background noise (noises that I have never heard with other headphones/headsets). Don't buy these expecting to hear any sort of detail in your bass."
2,Incorrect photo of items,"The photo of this product (10067953) is not a true representation of what one gets in the kit.The picture suggest one would gets a full body harness, lanyard, D-Ring connector strap and a pouch.Well, there is NO D-Ring connector strap included in this kit and the buckles on the leg strap have been replaced with clips."
4,Struggles for Survival,"King begins with a remarkably simple story about a search for a home and weaves it into an inspiring tale of love of the canine sort as Mutt Dog finds the affection he has longed for his entire life. Cast out and living on the streets of a booming metropolis, Mutt Dog is in a daily struggle for survival until one cold and blustery day, he wanders into a shelter and a nice lady lets him sleep inside. The next morning, she kicks him out only to call him back and take him home to her welcoming family. Readers will appreciate King's sometimes sorrowful, yet colorful sketches that set off the story as Mutt Dog encounters further hardships until he finally arrives at a place called home."
1,SCANPAN NON-STICK COATING COMING OFF,"I had a set of Scanpans for a little over two years. The non-stick coating is coming off in all the pans. The problem appears as pinhead sized silver spots where the coating is no longer there. Note that I always used plastic spoons cooked on low heat and washed the pans in the dish washer. Except for this major flaw, I liked the pans. Very little sticks to them."
4,This cd has a few good songs.,"The girls are the bomb, they sing their songs with so much passion, its incredible."
5,Get on the bus is the tightest song by Destiny's Child.,"Get on The Bus the second tightest song that Destiny's Child has made. Those girls have so much talent, and I would really love to sing like Beyonce'. The dance routine that they do is so pretty to me, and so is Beyonce'."
5,Great album for all moods!,"I'd heard a lot about this album and was glad to finally sample it on amazon. I especially like Billy's solid, steady drumming. He's even more amazing in person!"
2,THIS BAND WOULD MAKE A PERFECT NOVELTY ACT,"If this is ""Alternative's"" future, than Alternative is dead. This band would be wise to get out of the music business, unless they might consider becoming an Novelty act doing satire like Wierd Al Yankovic. I actually overrated them, because I think they could be great doing comedy, but ""real music""-forget it."
1,VERY BANEL GIRLEY POP,"This band is the result of what happens when upper middle class preppie college girls get bored at school and think they have the capacity to put a band together and write songs. I used to be supportive of female oriented bands such as"" Belly, The Breeders, L7, and Veruca Salt"", but this stuff is an insult to women who are trying to break into the music business. Velocity Girl at its worst with some Romper Room type stuff thrown in. I've known many female musicians, who could run rings around this band many times. If it were not for the mere fact that they were signed to a major label, this band would have recieved minimal reviews, if any at all. I don't percieve this band to become anything other than a tax right-off, with maybe a very small cult following."
4,It has all the songs...but not the notes,The book includes all the songs from the show but it doesn't have the other parts or harmony's written in. The piano part doesn't aid in that either (but that's a good thing...more like the original orchestrations). Overall a good resource and starting point.
4,You'll be playing in minutes...,"Larson has a knack of writing easy-to-play piano riffs that are a delight to listen to. When I started learning piano, I revelled in playing the songs in this book as some are so simple, yet so beautiful. After very little practice, you will be singing along to these great songs.If you are a fan of Rent, check this out. The recording is great and the music well arranged. From show ballads to rock songs, you won't be disappointed."
2,WARNING!,I bought this Cd looking for a budget best of the Knickerbockers.Turns out this Cd DOES NOT CONTAIN the original recordings! ALL TRACKS ARE RE-RECORDINGS!There are no liner notes on history of band and there are no notes on the circumstances of these re-recordings-such as who did the music and when did they do it.The music isn't bad but I wanted the original recordings! I gave it two stars cause I hate to give one of my fave groups of 60's one star.
5,Excellent,"I bought this unit over a year ago, and despite using it 3-4 times a week it looks and works like new. The only thing I've done is to squirt the coils with WD-40 twice, other than that it's maintenance free. I still enjoy using it on a regular basis.Update June 2008: I've moved to Hawaii and this was one of the few things I brought with me. Still use it 4-5 days a week and it is as rock solid as the day I bought it. I remain very pleased with the quality and workmanship. The physical benefits of rebounding are immense, and the fact that it's fun to do doesn't hurt either!Update May 2010: Solid as a rock, still love bouncing on this baby while I check my email before work. I seriously can not remember the last time I had a cold, it was many many years ago. I used to have 2-4 flu/cold episodes per year."
4,Works Well But You Must Control Your Bounce,"Most who consider purchasing a rebounder do so as an indoor alternative to jogging. When I saw the cheap version on sale on a tv infomercial, I began to investigate what was commercially available. It became apparent that the best buys were made by Needak and the ReboundAIR people. I read the reviews and chose the ReboundAIR by a narrow margin. It was not cheap nor did I expect it to be. It was a sturdy piece, well crafted, with a reasonably wide bounce diameter. As I began to bounce, I noticed that I could not perform wild acrobatics like Tom Hanks from BIG. As long as I was careful not to bounce too high or too energetically, I could obtain a moderate, light-impact aerobic workout. My heart rate increased just as if I had jogged, and I had fun since I could watch tv at the same time. I also did not have to worry about slamming my head on my ceiling. Overall, you do get what you pay for and in this case, the cost equalled an acceptably high quality."
4,Some of the most romantic Argentine Tango music ever!,"If you have so far associated Argentine Tango with the music of Osvaldo Pugliese or Astor Piazzolla, you'll be in for a surprise (and I bet a pleasant one). The music of Osvaldo Fresedo is some of the most romantic one ever played. It is soft, sensuous and has a pleasantly driving yet subdued rhythm.I find it to be great music for listening and for dancing.I'll give this CD four stars instead of five, because the cleanup of those tracks was not done as thourough as some other labals did. But that is just a minor complaint."
4,helpful and concise,"I have been searching for an atlas that would cover the events of World War I. Most of the ones I was considering had very few maps, and mainly contained photographs, general text of the events, and small maps lacking in detail. Any atlas that was specifically created for maps was geared towards current poitical borders and lacking in historical data. I was delighted when I received this atlas from Amazon and saw that it was maps, maps, and more maps, each highlighted by specific World War I era historical information. I have studied about a dozen of the maps thus far, and have been very happy, apart from one detail. Queen Victoria is referred to as Kaiser Wilhelm's aunt, rather than his grandmother. It remains to be seen if there are other minor factual errors in the remainder of the book. Apart from that, it is a perfect tool to aid in the study of the era."
4,Great for older cats too,"In the house this product is a godsend. Clean and easy to clean up the strays that make their way out of the cat box. This was recommended by my Vet., for post-surgical use."
3,Its OK for kids....nothing great,Not much information on any particular topic. I agree that its for small kids but I still feel this could have been written/compiled better and would have been more informative.
3,Needs to Be Updated,"My kids do like this book. It has a lot of pictures and information about different subjects. Unfortunately, the information in it out of date. For instance, the book states Jupiter has at least 16 moons. While this is true, every other book I've read states Jupiter has at least 63 moons....just needs to be updated."
5,wonderful book for young kids,"I ordered this book for my 7-year-old son, a 2nd grader, let him know the world around him. I would like to buy this referene series in the near future. Wonderful refence books for school kids, no need to say more about that.Amazon pissed me off on this order. They didn't proceed my order during the first whole week, then shipped my whole order on the 6th business day, planed to be dilvered on the 8th or 9th business day. I complained, and then got my stuff on the 8th business day.I was told the timing started to count from shipping date for 5-8 business day, not from the order date.So if you want this stuff as presents for the coming holiday, order early."
5,WHEN THE EMPRESS STRUTTED HER STUFF,"What this writer would not have given to be able to see Bessie Smith in her prime and in her glory. Bessie is an acquired taste. By that I mean that when listening to her recordings, especially if done in chronological order as here, it takes time until you are emerged in the music. Then you do not want to turn the damn thing off.Bessie Smith was no Billie Holliday. That shows no disrespect for either talent. Although Billie covered a number of Bessie's songs her's is a more stylized rendition for a different, generally more urban and urbane audience, than the juke joints Bessie, unfortunately, had, to play at. That said, for sheer power and depth of raw feeling- go to Bessie. Many a tough situation in my life got, at least partially, smoothed over listening to Bessie by the hour. What else can one say. Stand out songs here are St. Louis Blues and After You've Gone."
5,An Excellent Cure to Diet Doldrums,"Having been on the Sugarbuster diet for 7 weeks and losing weight weekly, I am very happy to have this cookbook as part of my collection. You tend to get in a rut with the foods you eat because most diets supply you with only two weeks of menu suggestions. Having the cookbook has greatly expanded my menu selections and is a wonderful addition to my kitchen. Recipes are easy and very satisfying. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Healthy cooking for life,"If you're looking for a guide for healthier eating and cooking, this is for you. Not only are the recipes easy and tasty, but the guidelines are informative and easy to follow. The pounds will shed without feeling hungry. The first 2 weeks were the most difficult as I cut down on all the sugar. I have more energy and it feels great to lose weight without sacrificing great tasting food!"
1,no confidence,"I purchased the Sugar Bust for Life Cookbook and Companion Guide. When I attempted to try my first recipe (Double Chocolate Brownie Supreme - page 288) I discovered it filled with errors and omissions. Salt called for in directions was not mentioned in ingredient list. Cream Cheese and extracts listed in ingredients were not listed in directions. No cooking time was given. How can I have confidence in a cookbook when the first recipe I wanted to use is incorrect? In the front of the book it says that ""Sir Speedy"" did the typing for the book. Apparently he did it a little too speedily. I would be interested to know if there is a corrected issue available - that I don't have to purchase. It should be made available free of charge."
4,"I'm sorry, I just can't hate them!","I tried... but I just can't. Listening to their music brings back too many fond memories, it's absolutely impossible for me to turn up my nose at NKOTB. When taken out of their late 80s context, songs like Hangin' Tough or Step by Step sound downright ridiculous and seem like nothing but ultra-saccharine bubblegum pop. But for old time fans like me, they remain enjoyable because they bring us back to a time when we, pre-teen girls, didn't have to shamefully hide our love for Joey, Jordan or Danny for fear of being mocked and ridiculed by haters the way BSB or Nsync fans had been a few years ago. NKOTB are the original pop boyband, and the aforementioned groups should be really thankful for them. The New Kids paved the way for pop craze that took place in the late 90s. And while this is reason enough for some people to hate them, I'm just grateful for all the childhood memories and the good times spent listening to NKOTB with my friends."
5,NEVER GOES OUT OF STYLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i actually love this album . i think that the vocals are excellent . jordan knight , joey mcintyre , and the others sing with such passion . my favorite songs on this compilation isi'll be loving you forever , if you go away , baby i believe in you and valentine girl , i would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of the 80s or just want to relive all of the memories ."
5,well......,"I am and will probably always be a NKOTB fan. I find it a little scary that I still know all the words to their songs that I haven't heard since I was 5 or 6, when they were in their prime. Yes, their music isn't deep, thought-provoking, emotional material (more along the lines of fun, upbeat, mind numbing cheeriness that only boy bands can come up with) but I honestly do like NKOTB, and will recommend this album to anyone who likes them also. It has their greatest hits (hence the title) and anyone who was not living under a rock in the 80's and early 90's will remember most of these songs, even if they weren't the biggest fan. I highly suggest this cd for anyone who was a fan, wants a flashback to the 80's, or just wants to listen to some good, fun-lovin' music."
5,Better than the boybands of the 90's,"New Kids On The Block is the only boyband that I appreciate. I was way back in 8th grade when I first heard of them via my girl classmates. It's a fact...they are better than the boybands of today. Cool songs like ""Cover Girl"" is a must-listen for those who like to be in 1988 again!"
4,A Helpful Resource,"This commentary provides a thorough analysis of the Greek text of the Gospel of Luke and is geared toward the serious reader of the New Testament who wants to understand the nuances and complexity of the Greek.Enormously learned, detailed in its textual, literary, redaction and tradition criticism, Marshall displays his customary grasp of the full range of contemporary scholarship and does excellent work in putting forththe various positions held by numerous scholars; but he nevertheless is pointedly dismissive of twentieth century liberal criticism. The vast majority of his insights prove reliable, helpful, and incisive, however, in a thoroughly conventional vein. These features, together with the orderly manner in which the material is presented, render the book a valuable contribution for the understanding of the Gospel of Luke. Furthermore, if you want to find consistently conservative views on the authorship, dating and textual integrity, then this is the place to go."
3,Could Have Been Meatier,"Among Evangelical New Testament Scholars, I. H. Marshall is among the best. His works continue to provide important opportunities for reflection. However, here in his commentary on Luke Marshall leaves his remarks on the text incomplete. His exposition on the greek text is good, yet for the pastor who is looking for help as Sunday draws ever more close, Marshall is less helpful. Written before narrative approaches became in vogue, Marshall's historical/ redaction approach is somewhat dated. His comments are thorough, his remarks evangelical and orthodox, his outlook on Luke, all good, however, this commentary could have been better."
2,Frustrating commentary,"I am sorry, but I cant give this commentary a high mark. I am not unused to technical commentaries, I use the Word- and NIGTC-series alot. But I am always disappointed with this one. He puts alot of effort into synoptic questions and textvariants (which I am not interested in), but not much into what Luke really meant, the theology of the text and how it fits into the doctrinal big picture. I like technical commentaries because they analyze the meaning of important greek words, but this one does not. So now I am still lacking a good commmentary on Luke (Geldenhuys and Ellis wont do either). Thinking of getting the NICNT one."
5,Gorgeous Book,"This is an absolutely gorgeous book, very comprehensive and tons of excellent pictures"
4,Brilliant collection of photos,"Despite Marable having been a Marxist, and therefore a foe of freedom for people of all colors, I'm glad I picked up this book... for $3, no less. It is an amazing collection of pictures from slavery on, and should inspire even conservatives and libertarians: tyranny can be defeated. The benefits of the book outweigh such a disgusting visage as W. E. B DuBois being feted by the Chinese communists in 1959."
3,"Interesting, but dense","I enjoyed a lot of the points made in this book, however, there were a few problems with it. I found the book, at certain times, to be extremely thought-provoking about my own process, bringing to mind things that I may not have noticed if I hadn't read about it. Still, much of it felt architecture focused, and not entirely applicable to other disciplines. Additionally, Lawson seems overly academic, especially in that he does not want to propose a theory that could be seen as ""wrong,"" meaning that what he proposes often falls on the side of boring. The book, as well, is dense, and definitely written by an Academic. Many times the points in the book are beleaguered, made too many times, and supported by one too many pieces of evidence. At times, I wish it was just a tad snappier in places."
2,It's OK but vocal arrangements could have been better,"This was quite the ambitious project. Produced in 1979, the disco era influenced everything from clothes to dancing to disco-izing other genres of music. In this case, disco got its hand son the musical EVITA.The arrangements are decent. They tend to run a bit long, though. The vocals are a bit weak and don't show much ability in range. It sound like they are all singing in eighth notes. It sounds very choppy.It also tends to sound repetitous. What they could have done was record more songs with shorter time lengths. Then, it wouldn't sound like the song was being worked to death, especially when the entire arrangement tends to be weak in the vocal side.Buy this CD only if you are must have everything EVITA or even Disco. Otherwise, have another friend buy it, then you can borrow it and then return it back. It is worth listening to but not sure if it's worth owning."
1,More terrible than words can express,This cd is a disgrace to Evita. It is a shame to fans of real singing and real music. To find a real version of Evita check out the soundtrack version with Madonna. This cd is garbage.
3,Easy to Setup but not stable,"No problem getting it setup and ready, but it frequently looses connection and using it for streaming to the other end of the house is difficult with this device. Should have stayed with the Netgear for this and upgraded to AV."
5,Works as advertised.,"Truly a ""plug and play"" device. I have an older sling box the was close to my router. After moving it to another room this device solved my wireing problems. The only issue is you have to plug the network end into the router directly. Going through a hub first won't work. Other than that, no problems what so ever.."
3,Tough to please,"This may or may not work for you. I've got it working in my house. I've got a Netgear router upstairs in my bonus room hooked up to a Charter Cable box. My Dish reciever is downstairs in another section of my house. The Slinglink Turbo works fairly well; however, if I plug anything else into certain outlets in my bonus room, the whole connection basically just fails. So be aware of what you have plugged into other outlets as it might cause the whole thing to fail."
4,Just get a long ethernet cable,With 100 ft between the modem room and tv room I connected the slingbox to the cable / tv. Now instead of purchasing the slinglink I wired the box to the modem by running a 100 ft. ethernet cable through the hall .the box has a direct connect to modem .
5,Great product idea,"Because I travel quite a bit, from hotel to hotel that never seems to have the channels that I like to watch, this makes it very convenient. While I sit at the airports I can now relax with any delay and watch my favorite show."
3,Easily set up and works but is much slower than connecting directly into router,"I had my slingbox connected directly to my Airport Extreme router in the Guest Bedroom and was consistently getting up to 8000Kbps using the Sling Mac client with no issues. I was forced to move the Slingbox over to another room and bought the Sling Powerline because I could not run a wire between the rooms. The setup was easy but my performance went down over 65%, now getting max 4000kbps and video is very choppy and jumps back and forth to no signal at all to up to 4000Kbps.The product will provide the convenience of not running a cable but it will come at a high performance cost."
5,I had no idea such a product existed!,"So I'm wireless, but I'm not really wireless? Whatever, it works! My router is in another room and setting up my slingbox was a breeze. I bought the 4 port and I'm glad I did. I will find use for this."
4,Works great with 1 exception!,I have a Belkin powerline adapter and needed more ports so I decided to go with the slinglink 4port. When I plugged in the slinklink it didn't work. I tried power cycling it and I new that this outlet was on the same power circuit as my router so that wasn't an issue. The last thing to try was to plug both of the components in the same outlet to make sure it was broken before I return it. Well when I plugged into the other outlet everything worked. I had unplugged the other end of the belkin powerline to accomplish this and that was the reason. For some reason the slinglink doesn't work on the power circuit as the slinglink. So for that reason I am only giving this 4 stars. 1 thing to note is my bandwidth has increased with the slinglink 4 port compared to the belkin single port.
1,Slinglink is junk,"Piece of junk --- did not work at all. All lights are on per manual. Did everything by the book, connected to the power lines diirectly - with verified Ehthernet cable and portsThis thing did not connect at all.DONT BUY THIS.I eneded up paying 13 dolars shipping cost for nothing"
2,Mostly Redundant,"If you buy this and wonder where you've heard this collection before, check out Bronx Blues. Most of that CD is duplicated here. You really gotta love Dion to have both :). Beyond the fact that this seems like a record company rip off, I never really felt that Dion's transition from doowop artist to solo rocker to lounge star to folk singer really worked that well at all. If you add folk singer to blues artist to gospel singer to rocker to oldies artist, I guess the circle is somewhat complete. This one just wasn't necessary."
2,Suitcase does break,"As the other reviewer wrote, the suitcase dents easily - in fact after one trip already. Unfortunately, my experience is contrary to the other reviewer in that the suitcase DOES break. After 15 months and about 10 trips, one of wheels is almost torn off. What's worse is that Samsonite recognizes the problem but only wants to replace the suitcase at a cost, while the newer models clearly have reinforcements in the wheel area demonstrating that this is a design flaw and should be covered by warranty.I agree with the other reviewer that the ""expandable"" feature is great and spinners are the way to go. The concept of the suitcase is nice but the material selection is flawed resulting in a huge dissapointment over the Samsonite brand."
5,Honky Tonk Supreme,"There's noone like Lefty. Never was, never will be. Fortunately, here's a 2 CD collection covering the biggest of Lefty's Hits, in their original form. All of his biggest numbers are here, and there's quite a few less-known songs here, as well. All of them are signature Lefty and they're all sure to please. No real complaints, although a better set of liner notes would be appreciated; but for the affordability of this set, I really cannot complain. Well worth your money."
1,QUALITY POOR,I THOUGHT THE OVERALL QUALITY WAS VERY POOR. I DID NOT GIVE THIS TO MY WIFE AND JUST DUMPED IT.
2,Green finger...mNferz,"I bought this as a christmas present for my girlfriend. I thought b/c it is sterling silver it would be good to go, but apparently it is just cheap b/c now there is a green ring around her finger. I'm annoyed and want my money back! Now I seem like a cheap-o that can't pick out a good ring...BS."
1,Worst Ring Ever!,"This ring is made of the cheapest ""silver"" known to man... it leaves your finger black within minutes of putting it on. These days, silver is usually at LEAST coated to protect the wearer from that ""oh so icky"" black tarnish that can form on the skin under the ring. No such luck with this piece of crap. Not only did it leave the ""attractive"" black as soot band around my finger, one of the rings I ordered (I ordered three for myself, my girlfriend and our ""gay supporter"" roomie) was defective in that the band that is supposed to spin, wouldn't budge without great force. So, at the risk of sounding redundant, this ring, is crap. Go buy something that has at least the coating on it to protect your finger from the appearance of blackrot!"
4,Lovely,"A solid little ring of decent quality. However it is much daintier than it looks in the photo, it isn't a terribly wide band, so the stripes on the heart are a lot less subtle than they appear in the picture. Overall a wonderful item."
4,Great for beginners!,"I find this book to be a great intoduction to Flash. It's not for advanced users, but I'm glad there is book aimed at us novices. I keep it on my desk and refer to it all day long. There is a sense of humor to the writing and the examples and lessons are great step-by-step tutorials of the kinds of things I wanted to learn how to do. It's very useful in trying to understand what Flash can and can't do and it has a lot of good information about planning a Flash project and what you will need to think about for the final Flash movie file. The only weird thing is that the book is about Flash 5 but it comes with Flash 4 on the CD Rom. You'll have to buy Flash 5 or download a trial version from Macromedia since versions 4 and 5 are substantially different. The book won't help you if you only have Flash 4."
1,Very Basic Book- Not Very Helpful,"This book is alright, but I did not learn anything new from it. It is a decent book if you are using flash for the absolute first time. For Intermediate to Advanced users- DO NOT waste your time on this book. It is not worth the money. I have used Flash for 3 weeks and I have to skip to almost the end of the book to find out something new. It does not cover many of Flash capabilities. I likedFlash 5 for Windows and Macintosh: Visual QuickStart Guidemuch better."
2,FLASH X/5,"ah the wonders of flash, and ah all the horrible books on it.... ill give it 2 stars since maybe it was just too rushed a book to be put out..... that really sums it up, ill have to say"
1,designer nyc,"HORRIBLE! A waste of money, valuable time, and trees.Teaches nothing of vaule to a designer and especailly the programmer. Sad Flash examples. The book is just not intouch with reality in todays market. Aviod the anger of writing a bad review, use another guide.Recommendation for Flash5, Quickstart Guide Flash and Quickstart Flash Advanced."
1,Very poorly done book,"You would hope that a book about Flash would afford you more education than comes with the product. This does not. It 85 percent screen shots (macintosh screen shots) and 15 percent text. This book is good if you aren't too bright and the manual that came with the software or the step by step tutorials are too complex. (highly unlikely) Returning my copy today, will try another author."
4,Love these earrings!!!,"I wear them with anything that has the slightest bit of blue, and they accent it perfectly. Though the moonstone is not as high of quality as i might have liked, what do you expect for the price. These are beautiful earrings and I get complimented on them all the time. If you are looking for something different than the same old gemstones, this is it!"
3,Not much rainbow,"This is a well made item, the only disappointment was that there was very little 'rainbow' effect from the stones, certainly nowhere near what is shown in the picture. I bought both necklace and earrings and this lack of rainbow effect was in all three stones."
4,Fine for the price,"At only $10 (I paid less -- on closeout at my local drug store) you can't complain about the little Clio. I thought it would be a piece of junk, and I was ready to be disappointed. But that was not the case. (Keep in mind that this is my first ever electric shaver.)Sure, it's not a quick shave; it takes several passes. (My facial hair comes fast, furious, and firm.) So I use it in the car, not each morning in the bathroom.Keep it cleaned out, and filled with fully charged batteries, and it provides a clean and comfortable shave. I wish I had bought two, for when this one dies. Although that doesn't seem likely for a while."
4,Worth the money spent,"This product in short is ""worth the money spent""Dont expect too much but u definately get your money's worth nothing more but nothing less eitherVery good for trimmingif used on daily basis good for clean shaves...Will not work efficiently if the hair growth is more but works good with small hair.Trimmer has to be gently used else will hurt...blades are goodcleaning shaver will b easy...using a brush will work fine....Cleaning brush is not provided with the shaver that shud have been...but amount of money is equivalent with what u get..."
2,You can do better.,"Over the past year, I purchased both the Clio 3250 and the Remington MSC-140. They're in the same price range but the Remington is much better.Where the Clio tugs at my stubble, the Remington shaves it smoothly. The Remington is more comfortable in the hand and generally seems to be superior in design."
2,Wrong Item,I thought this was a shaver but it's not it's a shaper/trimmer. Don't cut hair good @ all.
1,Looks good but does not cut too good,"I ordered two of this razor, one for myself and one for gift. After I try to use mine and found it does not shave too good, (Too slow and not closed enough.) I just through them away."
4,Final Chapter,"After all the hype of the last few years , it was good to see a documentary with straight forward information that led up to the release of innocent men."
1,Poorly designed and poorly manufactured,"The image in the product page has nothing to do with the product. The mirror is not adjustable. The clamp will work if you place it on at least a 2 inch diameter round surface. Despite a rubber coating on the clamp, it still requires securing it with a bolt."
1,Boring tale by an oftentimes good author.,Undeveloped threads of ideas abound; poorly developed characters; written like a freshman English course project; extremely difficult to read: not because of the okay writing style but because it's impossible to care about what's going to happen next. Disappointing because Simak is capable of *such* better storytelling.
4,Easy-to-Read Book for Entry-level Job Seekers,"A short, easy-to-read book for high school graduates and blue collar workers. Suggests the following strategy: 1) Identify your skills. 2) Write a resume. 3) Make a list of employers who might use someone with your skills. 4) Call as many people as you can who might use someone with your skills. 5) Get interviews from the employer or referrals that will lead to more calls 6) Be interviewed effectively and get hired. No discussion on handling job offers. Uses inspirational positive thinking. Very helpful to people with learning disabilities.Review appeared in Annotated Bibliography of Learning A Living; A Guide to Planning Your Career and Finding a Job for People with Learning Disabilities, Attention Deficit Disorder, and Dyslexia"
1,Save your cash,This guy is either totally deluded or on heavey narcotics. Unless your into urban legends I would pass this by.
1,Lack of evidence ruins a potentially good book.,"The cover notes for Mr. Case's book speak of new evidence gathered under the Freedom of Information Act. All this ""evidence"" consists of ominous letters and appraisals about the racial situation at Camp Van Dorn. Instead of a well documented history of a ""known"" tragedy at Van Dorn, the reader is treated to a novel. Equally lacking in both the ""evidence"" and the novel is the name of even one dead black soldier as a result of the massacre. Nor does Mr. Case document the authenticity of his sources, especially oral reports. That something occurred at Camp Van Dorn in 1943 is widely known. But only the cheapest of conspiracy theorists can hold that a lack of physical evidence is evidence of a conspiracy. Mr. Case fumbled the ball."
5,Wonderful & Inspiring!,This book is inspiring to all who read it. Marcie's spent her time in the school of hard knocks & has actually learned from it. Read her book & you will learn too! I did!
3,LOTS OF DRAMA....................,"The book opens with heroine Daisy Parker furiously destroying her live-in boyfriend's belongings....after all, where has he been all night? When it becomes clear that the problem is of tragic proportions, the unraveling of Daisy's life begins. Soon after this memorable night Daisy discovers many compelling and disturbing pieces of her boyfriend Jasper's life of which she was unaware. Left with her son Jay to raise, Daisy discovers shortly thereafter that the fight of her life, and his, has just begun. Thank goodness for the support of best friends Gigi and Ming Li....or can they REALLY be trusted? But it is the appearance of the delectable Adonis that leaves Daisy thinking that there may be love in her life after all.....A good plot, with many twists that I just did not see coming. Three stars only, as I felt as though the story just did not flow. Again--a good tale, but not as tightly woven as I would have liked.DYB"
1,Awful!,I bought this book by mistake. If I would have known Jamise L. Dames wrote it I would have NEVER bought it. I HATED her first overly predictable book and this one was even worse! It was unrealistic and all over the place. Ugh! I will NEVER read another Dames book. Her writing is horrible!
2,Then Pull Them Up!!!,This book kept you waiting on the other shoe to drop...seems like another book I read with a little twist...I guess it was an alright ride...it's believable...This is my first read byt Ms Dames....I'd give her another try on a slow day....
1,A no go,"This book was hard to get into I forced myself to finish it. The story made no sense. The author didn't know how to deliver the story line, it just made no sense to me. I see all the good reviews the story got.... But I didn't feel it!"
4,It CAN be played on a PC...,"The comment I submitted yesterday is, it turns out, not entirely fair. By suppressing the autorun of the ""mindengine"" junk, or exitting from it after it starts, you can run the cdplayer.exe program from your system32 directory and it will ""see"" the tracks. I've seen other ECDs that didn't require this bother, which is why I'd still deduct one star despite how much I like Joan Jett's work."
1,Shadow Wolf,The most irrattating piece of music I've purchased in a long time. I was glad to sell it . The phrasing made previous favorites annoying. I don't think I'll be buying any more of her music unless it's for resale on the web.
2,Bad compilation,She deserves better. Leaves out hit versions of LITTLE LIAR & I HATE MYSELF FOR LOVING YOU for for inferior live version and demo version respectively.
3,"coulda been a GREAT package, but isn't","Joan Jett is rock-n-roll. too bad this compilation doesn't do her justice. They could have fit more songs on here, where are BACKLASH, THE FRENCH SONG,DIRTY DEEDS,I WANNA BE YOUR DOG, REAL WILD CHILD,EYE TO EYE, and the original and superior versions of LITTLE LIAR & I HATE MYSELF FOR LOVING YOU? The versions they included here of those 2 and ROADRUNNER are awful. And the booklet could have included a lot more. 1 page devoted to a tiny picture and a quote from Dave Marsh? no thanks. Next time maybe we can get a better version of a so-called greatest hits from Joan."
2,Highly Over-rated!,"The photographs in this book are pleasant enough, but the information is frequently incorrect. Coles and Budwig are following up their previous poorly-penned book with more of the same. Bead research is accomplished by people who dedicate years to this pursuit. Merely publishing a few photographs with some garbled and incorrect information may be entertaining (especially for anyone who doesn't know any better), but is a total waste of time for anyone who is seriously interested in the subject. It were infinitely better to refer to Dubin's History of Beads, or almost any other publication."
4,Jewelry world tour,"If you love ethnic jewelry and want to recreate its look, this is the book for you. The breathtaking photos by Jonathan Lovekin place this in the coffee table book category. Coles and Budwig take you on a trip around the world, stopping in Europe and the Middle East, Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. They scoop up jewelry examples, show the technique, and give you a project to mimic the jewelry using materials that are not too difficult to obtain."
4,Functional but. . .,would have preferred that it could hang the same way whether on the inside or outside of the drain rack.
2,"Attractive, but not sturdy enough","While this item is attractive and is the size I wanted, I ended up returning it because it arrived damaged. One of the ""hook"" sections that fits over the dish drainer had broken off, and the main section of the holder was also cracked. This probably happened in transit, so if it's that easy to damage, I don't want to use it every day. Amazon promptly refunded my money, and I've ordered another similar, less-attractive item that will probably last much longer."
5,This is a good prepared food pellet for our parrots.,Sometimes it takes awhile for birds to get the idea that a newly introduced food is actually to be eaten. Our 5 birds seem to enjoy this product. It smells good and the listed ingredients seem wholesome.
2,Flimsy!,"I love these puffer balls, but this one is very flimsy and badly made. It has unfinished, straggly plastic bits, and the body of it is thin. It's not filled with enough air, and it's thickness is inconsistent. One square inch area looks especially easy to puncture. It's fine as a cheap toy that doesn't matter and you don't expect to last long, but I would not recommend giving it as a gift."
4,Hard-rock blues,"Okay, I'm not a Hound Dog fan -- not that I have anything against him, it's just that this is the only album I've got by him. Maybe it's because I doubt there's better album by him. This is a clear favorite for when I want some loud, electric blues. It's a great live recording that captures both the energy of the performance and gives a generally clean, balanced sound. The opener ""Give Me Back My Wig"" and his take on ""Dust My Broom"" are great work. The only thing that holds it back from a five-star is a few muddy tracks and a few uneven songs. Even with all that, if you're into electric blues, you should definitely have this album, along with Muddy Waters ""Hard Again""."
4,The Way Home,Aok book. There were parts I did not get as there did not appear to be enogh in. Who was Jack? how did he fit in the book besides Ryans best friend.
4,A Pretty Good Follow-Up To A Classic.,"Fenton Robinson's 'Somebody Loan Me A Dime' is a classic album, and this one is the follow up to it. An album like that is a hard act to follow but this one is still pretty decent. One weak point of it is a few of the song selections. The blues world did not need more versions of Roscoe Gordon's ""Just a Little Bit"" or Howlin' Wolf's ""Killing Floor"" and even Fenton couldn't put much life into them. Other than these song's the rest of the album is very good, particularly the title track, a nice original from Robinson, a re-cut of the classic ""As the Years go Passing By"", and a pair of T-Bone Walker covers, ""West Side Baby"" and ""Tell me what's the Reason"", a tribute to one of his mentor's.This album may not be the equivalent of 'Somebody Loan Me A Dime', but it still stands on its own as a fine work by an under-recognized master of blues. There is plenty of room for his fantastic vocal's and guitar playing throughout the album."
3,Decent Blues Album from Fenton Robinson,"""As The Years Go Passing By"" is the best song on this disc. There's no need for ""Just A Little Bit"" and ""Killing Floor"" to be included here, as a different reviewer on Amazon.com previously stated, and as Allmusic.com also makes clear. ""Somebody Loan Me A Dime"" is a far better album from Fenton, who is a wonderful singer and very good guitar player."
3,She is green with envy,"Fantastic cast (JOHN SAXON, BASIL RATHBONE, JUDI MEREDITH, and DENNIS HOPPER.) This formula program uses a standard threat that you have seen from the old 50's sci-fi and even pops up now and then today. Check out the 1990 technology such as a reel-to-reel tape recorder of which many of today's viewers have never seen. If you only had $50,000 to make a movie you would bring your home tape recorder also.In the year 1990 a technically advanced society has crash-landed on Mars just prior to our plans to go there. We sped up the process to see if we could help the survivors. I will not go into details however at one point the female alien (Florence Marly) looks up and find the female astronaut owns three male food containers and she is green with envy. What great threat can this being pose to earth? Worse still she seems to have her eye on a young Dennis Hopper."
3,boring?,"this 2 and1/2 hour video is just too boring.yes of course jerry is at his best, but then just buy the cd.not one shot of the crowd or surroundings the whole time.the film quality is average at best. the volume level of the recording also seems to be low. i can't believe the people at jerry garcia can't do a better job than this!!"
3,Miss this old friend,"I first saw the Dead in '69 at the Fillmore West and I was at the last two shows. I think Jerry was the greatest guitarist I have ever heard, not necessarily technique or speed, but the emotion in every note. The '89-'90 version of the Jerry Garcia Band was my favorite. It's nice to see him, them, again and the video of this DVD is excellent. The playing is not as inspired as the CD from the same time period, but still very enjoyable. The sound is terrible. The mix is awful. I rate it three stars because it's Jerry, and as a memory it's nice, but under any other circumstances, the sound is so bad it's one star."
5,"Soundgarden, A-Sides",This is one of the best cd's you will ever hear. It is perfect from start to finish.
5,"Great, but expected more hits","I thought Sound Garden had more popular songs. I guess I was wrong. However, that's not to say the song's on this album aren't great because they are. The first five song's I can do without, but after that each song is incredible. The new song's are also very good. If you like this check out Chris Cornells solo record. Some very good songs on that. Also, Audioslave is great too. Anyway, this album overall rocks hard. The later song's are worthy of buying this album."
5,One of the best bands of the 90's - period,"This is one 'best of' CD that does not fall short, as it does capture some of the best raw sounds of their early career (without resorting to demo/bathroom tapes for 'character') as well as their commercial succeses. Yep, as die-hard fans like me will admit, there are a few key SG trax missing here, but we are talking a major hit here. In other words, if you already have 'Superunknown', 'Badmotorfinger' and possibly 'Down on the upside' (like me), this CD has most of what you already have - I got it mainly for the earlier stuff and just to have some of their best stuff all on one CD...The bottom line is that these guys were an awesome rock band - too bad it broke up!"
4,Greatest Hits and Nothing More,"This album succeeds in the fact that it does present the ""greatest hits"" or radio singles of soundgarden's career. But like any big 'garden fan knows the best songs weren't necessarily the best songs. For new fans though this is a great place to start and also shows the earlier stuff for people who only got into them after superunknown. Plus the one new song Bleed Together is an extremely good song and I am puzzled as to why it didn't make it onto Down On The Upside. Bottom Line: Worth checking out."
2,"Soundgarden's ""Greatest Hits""?!?! You gotta be kidding me","As a huge Soundgarden fan, I guess the reason I give this ""Greatest Hits"" CD 2 stars is because I already own all the albums and there is nothing new here. Which is quite disappointing because there are some pretty awesome Soundgarden B-sides out there, including the dense and brooding ""Blind Dogs"" song they did for the ""Basketball Diaries"" soundtrack, the bouncy cute rock of ""She Likes Surprises"" from the European version of Superunknown, the excellent Devo cover of ""Girl U Want"", and the revved-up testosterone-laden ""Kyle Petty, Son of Richard"" from the obscure ""Home Alive"" CD. It would have been nice to include these rare cuts on a Soundgarden compilation album, the only one you get here is ""Bleed Together"" which is nothing to rave about."
4,Good Information,"I have read numerous books on the Native American Medicine Wheel, seeking to understand this Old Way of relating to the Earth and all upon it.This book gives excellent information as well as clear instruction on that subject."
4,Clarification,"Spirit is a great group, and this is a good album, though I like ""Twelve Dreams"" better.A previous reviewer suggested that Pink may have violated copyrights by using the organ riff from ""Fresh Garbage"".In fact, ""Feel Good Time"" (which has Pink singing and William Orbit contributing) includes songwriting credits for a certain ""Jay Ferguson"" (who was actually born ""John Ferguson"", and appears as ""J. Furgeson"" on ""Twelve Dreams""). He's probably legally allowed to borrow from his earlier work, and the result (a very modern pop song with more interesting chord changes than you usually hear today) is fresh. The video of the song (found on the DVD of ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"") is fun too."
4,Spirit born,"Spirit (bonus tracks): This, their first album, is very much an album of its time (1968), yet it continues to be relevant today (as all good musicianship remains relevant). Spirit's music always seems tame until you listen to the artistry and complexity of their playing and the excellence of their lyrics. I often have to turn the volume up a bit on their albums. It is not that the production is bad, on the contrary, the production is always very good, it just seems that Spirit is trying not to interfere with your conversation as you listen to their album. As entertaining as their first album is, it is no `masterpiece'. Their best work was still ahead of them, but this album is more than worthy of being a part of any music lovers library. The bonus tracks are a treat and they add to the enjoyment of the album."
5,What a great band!,"Spirit had been one of my top 3 favorite bands (Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, and Spirit!) back in the 60s. I had this album nearly the first week it had come out, and played it often and loved it dearly. My record collection was sold many years ago, and SO happy to find this re-issue on CD. And very nice liner notes and photos!!! YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Very Good Psychedelic Debut,"This is a great debut from one of LA's classic psychedelic-experimental bands. Mehcanical World and Fresh-Garbage appear to be the standouts to these ears. Both of these songs have those nasty, snaking fuzz guitar solos that Randy California enjoyed playing. Uncle Jack, sounds like a British psychedelic number while the other songs are not to far behind in terms of quality. California's guitar playing is excellent! The rest of the band performs tightly as well. Spirit is one of those lost bands from the 1960's that deserve much more credit and praise today. They were always trying something new, diving off in all kinds of genre exercises. Spirit was always ahead of their time and will be fondly remembered. Also recommended are The 12 Dreams of Doctor Sardonicus and The Family That Plays Together As Spirit (Both are classics of the era!!!!!!!)."
4,Revisiting the Good Ol Days,"After school, late sixties, Friday night. My buddy and I are upstairs listening to the latest LPs. He whips out this album. Strange cover, a weird kind of mellowness to the music but combined with solid driving jazz grooved guitar riffs, very West coast. Topanga canyon, never heard of it until then, but as the warm distorted flow of the mescaline would start to kick in and the sun was just starting to go down, I watched the world from my own Topanga window. If I listen to this album today, I can almost feel that time again. God I miss the sixties and being a punk experimenting with anything and everything. This album represents an insightful trip into a time that will never come again."
4,blast from the past,"This ""album"" is worth it for the first 3 cuts alone. Classics. The liner notes written by Randy California are very interesting as well. Who would have guessed (or remembered) that Led Zeppelin opened for Spirit at one time? and ""borrowed"" the opening for Stairway to Heaven from them?"
4,okay i guess,"the opening riff from Taurus was not stolen from led zeppelin, the openings of both songs are just similar, Spirit even said they could see no influences in ""Stairway to Heaven"""
3,"Nice, but too thick.","It is a good size, nice heat and the massage isn't bad for the price. I did find the pad to be too thick, making it a little awkward to lay on being that it doesn't collapse or flatten all the way when you put weight on it. It's not the standard flat heat pad that I assumed, but if that's not what you need, it's a good buy."
3,Massager with Heat,"I have been using this massager for a weeks now, specifically on my knees. I place the pad on top and bind it down with a belt. I then set the vibrate for high and the heat for low. The high setting was a little too hot, even through my pants. I then let it vibrate for about 30 min. then I switch to my other knee.This is a simple pad that provides heat and vibrates. It is not a true massager that I expected. What I was expecting was something that would actually move and massage my knees. Sadly this does not do that, it just vibrates.For the money and my first massager I think its OK but a hand massager that would be applied manually I'm told is much better. No machine can replace the massage of another person."
2,Heating Pad Does Not Heat,"This heating pad was to replace another Sunbeam pad that has provided many years of excellent service. This pad, however, provides almost no heat. It vibrates well, but unless you are looking for a massager, I would recommend you forego the additional cost and just buy a heating pad that knows how to do Job #1: Heat."
1,Barely feel the warm,"For massage part is okay, however the heating part is not warm enough. You can only feel a little warm. Finally got return it."
5,Get one for everyone in the house!,Fantastic thing to have on a cold winter night - or when your back is ailing you! I should have gotten more than one because everyone in the family wants it all at the same time. Stays on an hour and then turns off automatically. The massage is very nice and the heat makes you go to sleep instantly. It's just like magic.
1,Doesn't produce heat...BARELY gets luke warm at best.,"Orignally, I thought the massager aspect would be a nice addition and it is. However, the humming tends to be a bit louder than I expected...so I would advise to keep it on the low setting. As for the heating aspect, it doesn't get hot at all or rather it doesn't produce enough heat (at least) for me and only 1 side heats up. BARELY gets luke warm at BEST. If you're looking for a real good heating pad (1 that will actually produces heat)...THIS IS NOT IT. I've already requested a refund."
4,Great,This small heating pad is wonderful. Just the right size for taking with you when traveling. The massager isn't as strong as I would like but still does a good job
3,A Little Disappointed,"Wasn't very big, stiff, hard to wrap around leg. Massaging is very nice along with the heat. Not as big as a normal heating pad."
1,no go,"I believe if the vibration was removed, the heatinig mechanism would be better and hotter I needed intense heat, this did not deleiver"
1,Too much of noise and less heating,"Bought this product thinking that it has a nice massage setting. But the massage feature of this product is horrible.. just too much of noise. not only that, the product takes 15 minutes to heat up and then too does not give enough heating.But returns on Amazon are amazing. Had asked for refund and instantly got one too. thanks Amazon"
5,Heat & Massage Pad,This is one great Massage and Heating Pad. I got it for my wife who is in a Nursing Home and in a wheel chair. She loves to have her back massaged and this is just the ticket.I also want to thank Amazon because the first shipment was lost in transit and they sent me a second Heating and Massage Pad at no charge including express delivery. I have been a customer of Amazon for many years and this is the first time there has ever been a problem with delivery and Amazon really came through for me. With service like that I will be a customer of Amazon for many more years.
3,"Ok product, depends on what is important to you","If you want the vibration massage, then get it, otherwise, as a heating pad it is not very practical, it is very thick, and rather slow in heating up. It does turn off automatically after certain time which is good safety feature."
1,Vibrating massage portion fails,"Like another reviewer here, I found that the massage portion fails... for me very quickly, after about 2 months of use. Very cheaply made product."
2,Not so hot!,"Ordered this for my husband to replace worn out old, inexpensive heating pad.This one is dissappointing. It does not get very hot & is too noisy when on vibrate.He barely uses it. He carried his old one from room to room like Linus from the Peanuts w/ his blanket:)I do not recommend this product."
4,Excellent but no moist heat option,"I am quite pleased with this heating pad after several days of use for my sore back from shoveling snow. I previously had a pad that had a moist heat option (wet sponge). The sponge died, couldn't find a replacement and after reading the description here on Amazon, decided that having a massage would be useful. One minor point, the Amazon description states: Moist heat option for deep penetrating relief. Not so, at least according to the instructions enclosed and info from the web site. No big deal, it works fine but I'm leaving off one star mostly due to the incorrect info here on Amazon. In the end, not having heat worked OK (no moist bed) and the massage seems far more effective. Pain the back is gone after three days of use each night."
4,Would recommend,"Love coming home to this after work. Vibration part isn't necessarily my favorite and it does get squished/condenses into a little ball after multiple uses, but you can easily manipulate back into a flat pad."
3,Don't make them like they used to....,"I've been using a 30 year old heating pad that is in great condition!!! I decided to purchase a new one so that we would have two heating pads in the house. It takes a while to heat up so think ahead, and it's really stiff. It is realy stiff plastic that can not be bent to lay firmly across your knee for example. This is most for a tummy ache of a back ache. I do like the automatic shut off after about 30 minutes, however it take about that long to get really warm so I just try to remember to turn it right back on; but it's nice to know that it will shut off if I fall asleep.I won't say it's bad, I'll just say that they don't make em' like they used to : )"
5,Wife loves it!,"Got this as a gift for my wife as she has back pain from time to time. She absolutely loves it. It is pretty basic, with heat of Off/Low/High and massage of On/Off."
3,Okay,"It is a well-made product, but did not produce the massage I was hoping for. For most people, however, I am sure this would be a fine, soothing heating pad and would recommend it."
5,Basic and good,"This is an ideal product--it serves the purpose it's supposed to with no frills, it's a good price, and it's well designed.This is one of the best purchases I made all year."
2,Sunbeam massage heating pad,"After only almost a year of consistent, but infrequent use, the massage portion failed. It was an odd product, anyway, having to emplace in one direction and its massage was variable in output. Not recommended."
2,Does not generate much heat,"As a heating pad, I give this thing 1 star. It takes forever to warm up to 'maximum', which is a pitiful amount of heat. Even with the cover taken off, heat on 'high', and the pad against my bare skin, it still isn't much warmer than the body heat given off by your average house cat. That might be enough for other reviewers, but not me.As a massage pad, I give it 2.5 stars. Yeah it's loud, but it does feel nice and relives some soreness as long as you are leaning or lying down on it so that it presses into you. Otherwise you won't even feel anything.I'd recommend this pad as a (very) cheap massager if you have some mild back soreness or something. I wanted this thing for heat therapy on my wrists, but the heat isn't nearly high enough to help anything. I guess I'm going back to microwaving a sock full of rice."
4,Good heat & massage function,"This is really pretty good for the price. The heat and massage functions both work very well and I really like the auto-shutoff after one hour. The only minor issue I have is that the pad is a little bulky and so doesn't bend much or conform to the shape of the area you are using it. This is fine if you have, say, a sore back, but I have rib pain on my left side so I wanted it to kind of wrap around the side of my body. Instead it basically just sits flat on top. Not a huge issue but something to consider depending on where you plan to use it."
3,Works but not very effective,"My wife has had some back pains and some knee pains, so I bought this for her. She does get some comfort using this, but its very subtle. Ofcourse I didn't expect the pad to treat her condition, but she has used better heating pads. The heating is good, but the massaging option is not upto par. Sunbeam can definitely improve on this product."
2,Loud and not hot,"As some of the other reviewers noted, this did not get nearly hot enough. It was also too small and the thickness (probably to allow the massage) was uncomfortable. The massage portion is very loud even when I had ear buds in. I returned it after turning it on twice."
3,nice and warm,"This is such a relief when I'm getting cramps.Only thing is that the cloth part slips off easily, and the pad isn't flexible.Got this for my boyfriend's grandmother: [...] and I wish I had gotten it for myself. It's softer, you can wash the whole thing, it's flexible and much larger. Considering they're the same price, I would definitely go for that."
2,Just Okay,"I wanted a heating pad for my lower back but also one I could use on my shoulders and neck. This heating pad is okay for the back but not for the shoulders. At first I liked that it was thick and seemed to support my lower back, but after a while that thickness started to bother me. It heats up okay, not crazy about the massage feature and would prefer a soft heating pad without the bulk. I bought two of them and am sorry I did."
4,The only thinkg like it,This is a replacement. My wife has gone through a couple of these--they last about 2 years then start making loud noises. This is the only one with both heat and vibration to help a sore back or hip.
4,Product worth the price by 90%,"Sony has all the good features with this model with high processor speed in its class and the 1 gb RAM with which you can do lot of high volume processing with applications. The Screen clarity is very good. Power backup is at the max 60 mins with the min resolution setting. Not recommended for the people on move, then you may need additional power backup and weight you need to carry back(8 lbs).The only disadvantage is it does not have infrared sensor and s-video pin and quite bulky for 8 lbs.The audio quality is improved in this model with good dolby sound though near the screen. Bit confusing for new users where to find the standby, hibernate, shutdown switches, its all to be configured inside control panel.Enjoy Sony.............."
1,SonySucks,I purchased a Sony k35 and Had very bad bad Experience with it..I was a very good fan of sony products till I bought this laptop. Sony Customer Service is Horrible and unbearable.. They are a pigs when comes to answers to your problems.. Try it for yourself once.. and you will never call Sony support again..I tried this one at the store. This K37 is also in the sam range as k35. I used the k35 laptop for only 6 months now.. you know what i am upto :* my mouse buttons are bad* the battery life now stands only 30 mins. (sony says 1 hr min)* The power pin is broken* My DVD drive doesnot work at all.* I couldnot create a restore CD.. The support person asked me to buy one from sony shop for $15Gone are the days of sony s quality and value.. Never try a a sony product again
2,Really disapointed,"I was really disapointed with this computer. 3 months after buying the notebook. My hard drive crashed and i had to spend like 200 dollars to get it fixed. Its also very bulky and compared to the modern age computers, it is also slow."
3,Great Features,I have had two of these watches primarily due to the multiple alarms.. it reminds me of all my family birthdays. It is great for timing while grilling. The down side is the short battery life and its durability.
5,Great!,"This watch is awesome. All the features I want, plus more. And it's comfortable and well designed."
2,BOUGHT TWO OF THEM,"FIT GREAT ON MY FIRST INSTALLATION, BUT ON THE SECOND IT WOULD NOT FIT PROERLY AND LEAVES A HALF IN OPENING IN THE FRONT OF THE COMPUTER."
5,Makes For a Nice Installation,"I got this USB hub when I rebuilt my desktop computer from the ground up. Even with extra ports on the back, and a couple that came on the front of my new case, I knew I would need more. This is especially true with some of the portable hard drives that require two USB ports (but don't require an external power supply)."
1,Not Renesis (NEC) device,marketing collateral says NEC hub controller. Unit came /w Via controller which is crap. attaches to my ASUS motherboard (NEC root) as USB 2.0 device. Operates at USB2.0 speed.
5,great fun; easy to use,"I don't have a lot of patience or talent for putting things together. I bought this for my son when he was 5 and he loved it so much I bought it again when he was 6. The pages are just torn out and folded together easily and they fly great! My kids have had so much fun playing with these airplanes. This time around I'm going to try ""World Record Paper Airplanes"", but the ""Kid's Paper Airplanes"" was a big hit for us."
4,Great designs!,This was a gift for my 8 year old nephew. We haven't gotten a chance to make any of the planes because he had so many other gifts at Christmas but I must note how brilliant the paper is and the designs looked fantastic. We often make paper airplanes when he comes for visits so hopefully soon I'll have a review on how these actually perform.
4,Nice book.,"I bought this book for my 8 year old and he was very excied about it, but he got bored with it after just a week."
4,Seemed to be a hit!,I bought this as a gift for a 6 and 9 year old boy and I was told by both of their parents they enjoyed it I think it was a nice gift idea for the price.
5,Great Book,"I ordered two copies of this book for a 9 year old boy who loves airplanes. That's how much he liked it! Very happy with the whole concept. Educational, and colorful, interesting, easy to follow directions for all airplanes."
3,Didn't know what I was buying,"It has alot of good ideas and the planes are templates on the books paper. So, you make the planes out of their pages. Well the pages are too heavy to fly very well. The templates are too complex for my 7 yr. to make out of other paper. We were just looking for ideas and instructions for the paper we have at home. The book just wasnt' what I was looking for."
5,Paper Airplane Book,I purchased this book as a gift. It was a big hit. He was showing all of his friends the book. There is a huge variety of paper airplanes to make as well as useful flight information. I would recommend this book to others.
2,Buyer Beware- Dracula and Skeletons?,"I bought this book for a nephew who loves paper airplanes. I read all the reviews before purchasing and it looked great. However, when I got the book, I was looking through it and was appalled at one the planes! I do not understand why the authors would choose to put a plane with Dracula, skeletons, and evil eyes all over paper airplane! This page (three actually) is demonic looking and certainly not appropriate for a child. Had this been sold as a Halloween book or something, well, at least you would expect something like that and could avoid purchasing it. In my mind there is absolutely no reason an airplane book needs to include evil images like that and I am debating between sending it back and ripping the inappropriate pages out (about 5 total because of the directions). I can't believe there were no comments in the reviews about this being included. I'm very disappointed. Hopefully this will at least alert like-minded parents to the content of this book."
1,The airplanes don't fly well at all!,"The book has pages you can rip out to make colorful airplanes, but they don't fly worth a hoot! I would skip this one!"
5,Excellent shoe,This slip-on is light weight yet substantial. They are extremely durable and stand up to the test of little feet. They stay new looking much longer than your average pair of sneakers/shoes.
1,Rethink this Purchase...,"If you are looking for an ice shaver, this name is well known. But if you want one that LASTS, rethink this purchase. Recently, my wife had gastric bypass and what helped her get her fluid intake was to chew on some shaved ice. So, I went down to the local Target and got this product. It shaves ice really well, but not designed to last. Six days after I purchased it, I exchanged it for another because the little switch stopped working. Seven days after that, my wife just took it back because the same switch broke. It's well designed that youngsters can use, but not built for use more than once or twice a week, if that. If you are looking for a ice shaver that can be used 3-4 times daily, don't pick this model unless you have the time and gas to go weekly to exchange it for a replacement. In other words, don't waste your time on this model."
1,Dissapointed,Worked great for a couple months and then the gears stripped out. Guess you get what you pay for.
4,Snow Cone Maker,This Snow Cone Maker did a good job we were impressed and so easy to useI could trust the grand kids to use it and not make a mess... We think itsa good product for the price.
1,Gears Strip Easily,"This little appliance worked great at first, then after several uses I started noticing a BAD sound coming from it. Starting and stopping a lot seemed to help. After about the 8th time the kids and I used it, the thing became worthless. We didn't overload with ice, and I even tried using crushed ice from our freezer hoping that would lessen the burden. But it didn't help.Today we're throwing it away. I really hoped it would lasted longer than that. I would not recommend buying it."
3,Great time saver,"This RIVAL ice shaver is great. It's cute, clean, fast, easy to use, and would make a great addition to any kitchen or kitchenette."
1,Don't Bother,"I wish that I could give this item less than 1 star. It worked well the first couple of times that used it. After that, it seemed to be hit or miss; sometimes it would work fine, others times it wouldn't work at all (although banging it on the kitchen counter seemed to work at times). I didn't even want to waste my time with exchanging this piece of crap for the same piece of crap so, after owning it for approximately one month, I tossed it. It has to be the worst appliance I have ever purchased. Don't bother wasting your time with this garbage."
4,Rival Snowcone Maker,My son got this snowcone maker for his birthday and he loves it. We have used it about a dozen times and it has worked great. It is easy for the kids to use also and easy to clean. I would definately recommend this for the kids.
5,The Witcher Rocks!,"It reminds me a bit of Prince of Persia, but much, much better. You've got to have a good system to run it or it's going to run really slow, but if you've got a halfway decent system it's fantastic! I highly recommend it."
1,Caution!,"I just want to caution you about patching this game. In order to apply patch 1.4 you need to register the game with the designer in Europe. After you complete the registration, you are supposed to receive an email code to allow you to patch. You never receive the code and cannot apply the patch. It appears to be a scam to get your information.Atari is completely useless in providing the patch or a method of installing the patch. Atari distributes games, but doesn't seem to care whether the customer can get support for those games. This was also my experience with Ghostbusters.This review is more about the support of the game verse the game itself. Don't buy games from Atari!"
5,Captivating and stunning - I think the best ever,"I bought this for my wife, who is really into these sorts of games. She has been doing games on PCs for over 20 years, and I can tell you straight up, this one was her favorite. Looking at the nimber of old game boxes in out computer room, I'd estimate she's done about 100 RPG/Adventure games. I watched her and I have to say the dialog is impressive, the graphics absolutley stunning, and the story and challenges are compelling. Granted, there is some salty dialog at times, but it works with the plot and characters.Five stars, without a doubt."
4,Very Fun,"This is a very fun RPG! I've been enjoying thisw for awhile now, and just can't get enough...even playing this instead of World of Warcraft and Warhammer online. Good value, good game. I do have to say that you should save some money and buy this version instead of the enhanced, because you can download the extra content for free from atari"
3,Not Loaded Enough,"This game suffers monstrously from unforgivable load times when going from place to place. The wait is longer for some areas than others but all are simply punishing. My system far exceeds the minimum specs and I keep my rig in fine condition, I've had no similar problem with other very demanding games. This must be the sorry copy protection they have unwisely chosen, or just bad programming. It is an insult to honest people who have paid the going price for a crippled product. Other than that, everything's fine."
1,The Ehanced Edition Trap...,"AS I was decived by The Witcher 2 pc game, Now so even more. Did not launch .Was not Installed. Can not play. Patches did not work either. Nor instructions from the off.site worked. Don't want to spend all my time downloading. Buyer Beware! If it is not the ENHACED EDTION - Don't buy. I have a very decent Lt."
3,PC GAME,GOOD GAME THAT NEEDS SOME FIXES SO IT DOESN'T CRASH SO MUCH IF IT IS EVER FIXED IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL
3,It will tide you over,"It's a cross between NWN2 style fighting with some button mashing elements in it. Load times suck. There is a lot of dialogue and running around which can get tedious at times. Real time fighting works out okay although the controls are a little clunky. Otherwise decent story, good voice overs, good music and the graphics are fair to middlin."
4,Within an inch of perfection,"This game is one for the ages, and humble opinion be damned. I see it as the spiritual successor of Planescape Torment, one of the finest in its genre, and I had frankly lost all hope of ever deriving so much enjoyment from a computer RPG again. Great story, slick graphics, seamless controls, varied gameplay, excellent music and surprisingly good voice acting. I only gave out four stars, because I believe five mean a perfect product. This game's flaws, while minor and mostly already patched, prevent me from considering it perfect, but for all I care, it can get four stars and a half.A true work of love and dedication from the game's developers. If you have to buy one game this year, get this one."
2,Pretty fun,"I played this through chapter 2 and lost interest. There is alot to it and it kept my interest until I realized that some of the quests are outright boring. I really wanted to like this game, but the dialog is boring. The dialog option you get to choose do not flow well with the conversation. The game is very buggy as well. Save a lot because it will crash. There was a part when I just kept going up to this gate and I got some dialog and then the game camera was stuck, I couldn't do anything...I gave up after that. It seems that developers need to fix a few things still as I am playing the newest version. The fun part is the fighting and building your character. The stat tree is kinda cool. Making potions from herbs is cool. I wish they would have made more of a way to blacksmith. You only get to switch between 1 piece of armor. The game is just kinda boring. I bet it was pretty darn cool back in 2007 though."
4,Not too shabby,"Good: Decent storyline and voice acting. Graphics are good and fairly stable. Not too linear.Neutral: Combat is 'meh', but ok. Some fights are very easy, and some are insanely difficult. Not much in the way of 'traditional' monsters. I'm old school so I like the orcs, goblins, etc. as opposed to critters I've never heard of like felders, ifriit, etc.Bad: Don't censor content. It's rated M, so assume that's what the audience will be. No first person view. Very annoying to me, but some may prefer it. Storyline is difficult to follow some times and choices often don't make sense and derail quests. Fairly lengthy load times, even on fast machines.Bottom Line: Fun game if you like mature RPG games."
4,Played The Witcher four times,"I rarely replay games (I think Oblivion was the only other) but so enjoyed The Witcher that I've played it four times and plan on playing the enhanced version, too.Really, my only complaints relate to inventory handling, which I hear is to be improved in the enhanced version. It is terribly hard to keep inventory organized and quickly becomes a mess. The capacity is also less than in many other games. I did appreciate the fact that quest items were in a separate slot, but I wish the game would allow you to drop duplicate quest items.Again, I look forward to the enhanced version, and of course the sequel!"
1,Avoid this game unless your computer is newer than new,"I have a Dell XPS 700 Dual Core 2.4 Ghz with 2 GB of RAM, and an NVidia Geoforce 7900 GS.Transitioning zones is painfully slow; I could read up to a chapter of a good book while I wait. Moving in and out of buildings as small as a hut is considered a zone where the system needs to load the zone. The game crashes frequently as well.This was the most money I completely wasted in 2007. I'm sorry I purchased the product.Yes, if some one pays for full shipping, they can freely have the product from me."
2,Not Very Good,"Maybe it is just that Oblivion set the standard so high for RPG games but I am disappointed with this game. Graphics are only average, the game is pretty linear, combat not that fun, and much to my disappointment I just could not get into it. Maybe you will have a different experience but I would be cautious about spending over fifty bucks for this game like I did."
2,Resource intensive,"Has some merits but pales in comparison to Morrowind\Oblivion, Dungeon Siege, Lion Heart, etc. Its obvious the creators have opted for glitz over substance. My suggestion? Save your $55.00 + replay Diablo. Far more fun and satisfying without the obvious performance and technical issues. When the 1.2 patch for this game is about 115 mb's its obvious there are some serious technical flaws."
1,missing the single most important parts to true crime novels,"to even be readable a true crime book needs to contain explicit, detailed, raw description of each and every murder committed. A book on Pee Wee Gaskins is the cloest i have read to meet this standard, and even that book failed miserably. there have only been a handful of true crime books that i found worth reading over the last 30 years. Its very frustrating, non fiction is castrated in description, fiction is just that, fiction, manufactured, made up, by definition boring."
3,Dark Secrets,"The story begins with Victoria as a child and follows her as she grows up. This story did not ""hook"" me. I only continued with the story because I like gothic romance. Frankly, until the end, it has many boring moments. Perhaps if man who becomes Victoria great love played more of a role in the story it would have been more interesting. Over the course of many months, the man is hardly even mentioned let alone seen. Then at the very end he is ""The One"".The mysterious aspects of the story are great. There are ghosts, madness, and the threat of the unknown villian. But the love story is sadly lacking."
4,"Puppies, nearly as cute as babies","There's just something to be said for Wegman's puppy images being juztaposed with images of your own baby. This is my favorite baby book I've seen out there and I really shopped around. I didn't want a ""traditional"" baby book, but I did want to add in all of the usual information somewhere. Wegman's Baby Book let me do all of that, provided me with a super cute height ruler that I can use for longer than a year and all with pictures of shiny, silver weimeraners. So adorable. And, the cover is really soft as a bonus."
3,Inadequate,"There were 6 Rats albums and 3 or 4 solo albums. This album seeks to span the whole lot with the result that it is weak. I was so appalled by the track listing, I downloaded software from the net and recorded all 6 onto CD from the original vinyl. The biggest problem with this type of condensed album is that record companies think that this is enough and the original albums and b-sides are never heard of again. Ever heard the Rats version of ""Barefootin""? Ever think you will? My own Rats compilation stretches to 2 CDs and there isn't a bad track on it. If you don't have access to the originals, go ahead and buy this. If you do have them, spend the money on software and record them onto CD."
5,The Very Best,"My musical tastes are mostly classical, but Brown is of such calibre that he easily fits in with Shostakovich, Beethoven, Weber, the great composers. Each song has the ability to take you into a separate complete universe...""heaven and hell"".I reckon that Brown is America's greatest living vocalist."
5,The one and only Oscar Brown Jr.,"I have been listening to Oscar Brown Jr. since the sixties when this album first came out. My mother loved 'But I was cool'. I recently saw him in person in Chicago along with his two daughters Maggie Brown and Africa Brown, both of whom are fabulous singers. Oscar at seventy-five years old was still in great voice and gave a wonderful performance. He sang new songs as well as beloved old ones and had the audience in the palm of his hand. It is a shame that such a talented man did not receive wider recognition. Oscar is not only a songwriter, but a playwright and poet. And those are only the talents that I know of, he most likely possess even more! Genius such as his is rare!"
4,The Signifyin' Monkey ( My First LP...),"....my Uncle Jim gave it to me when I was about 7 or 8, thereabouts, but I actually did not play it until I was in my 20s. I don't know why, it just happened like that....well, see, I got more into jazz and blues when I was in my 20's. Me and my buddies back then tripped about ""Signifyin' Monkey"" because it was always something that was told to you in rhyme by either one of your dad's buddies or one of the ol' guys at the corner barber shop. Those guys always went ""...do ya know about the signifyin' monkey"", and whether you did or did not, they told the rhyme, anyway....But, however, since one of my passions is listening to great music of all kinds, I did not stop there on this LP. I also dig Brown's cover of ""Afro Blue"" and the great ""But I was Cool""...Brown also wrote another of my favorites ""World of Trouble"" by Lou Rawls (I'm guessing Lou wrote the introductory narrative).And now, it is offered thru Amazon.com. I am amazed, to say the least..."
2,If you think you understand SOUL!,"If you think you understand SOUL, and you havent listened to Oscar, then you havent a clue!!!!"
3,Very good performer with an Achilles' heel,"I bought the G4000A from Amazon last year. Had no problems with the Amazon transaction, a good thing.The other reviews cover things nicely. A very solid performer, great audio quality, nice looking, decent performance, easy to use.One weakness, though, is the telescopic antenna mount. The up-and-down mount is of flimsy design and if the antenna is rotated, the mount can actually break free of its guiderails inside the radio. Once this happens, additional rotation can disconnect the antenna from the radio.Shoring up the guiderails is not so difficult, and it can be done (I did, with excellent results), but this design issue should not exist in the first place.This review may be no longer pertinent since the G4000A is no longer in production, but for those who wish to pick up a used one, it is something to keep in mind."
4,Recommended,"It is a solid little radio and has held up well through no small amount of abuse on my part. It is fairly user friendly, but could stand to be better, thus only 4 stars. But once you use it a little bit you don't stumble around with the features."
1,Junk Radio,Its Junk.We have sent it back.Looks and works like some thing you could buy at the local drug store for a lot less money.This is the first time I have ever sent something back.I'm also being charged $6.88 to ship it back to Amazon.We have now ordered the Sony ICF-SW7600GR from Amazon.I'm hoping Amazon will give me credit for the re-turn shipping cost?Thank You
1,Sorry I bought This,"Sorry I bought this radio. I have many SW radios. This one has very good fm and very good am. Thats it. Short wave is terrible, misetrable,weak ,stinks. Would not reccomend. Even with outside ant short wave stinks. Wisk I would have returned it."
1,Sending it back,"It's a nice radio. I used it only one day and it worked well. Then, the next day, the digital readout--which is essential because you need to see the frequencies--started losing some of the lines as if there was low battery power or a short. Going to AC didn't change it. I'd turn the radio on and off two or three times and the digital readout would again work for awhile and then act up again. But this intermittent stuff happening within a day or two of use has me returning the radio to Amazon. I'm not sure if I want another Grundig or not. Seems like many people are happy with their radios so maybe I just got a lemon."
2,"A sure 1.5 to 2.0 star rating, I had hoped for more.","Trusting to insightful reviewers here, I purchased a Grundig G4000A with a few clicks. I supposed that my Dad's Grundig of the 50's wouldn't be dupiclated in a G4000A; but, all I wanted was quality reception and a nice sound. My radio provides neither. Yes, it's a nicely finished set and all it's options work. That's about the best of it. My night stand holds a $10 Sony clock radio that puts the Grundig's reception and sound quality to shame. A standby battery operated radio is a must in South Florida and this set will do that job nicely. I had hoped for more."
5,SWL review of Grundig G4000a,"Long time SWL, and I can appreciate the SSB reception of the Grundig. This unit was a replacement for a YACHT Boy that got fried by a power surge...I loved that radio! This was an ample replacement for the fried one. The reception on all bands is excellent due to the double conversion receiver. The tuner is a bit slow, but I can zero in on a cw signal or a ssb sig with no problems. I particularly like the narrow filter in the short wave bands, it keeps the band noise out of weak stations. This is all capped off by an excellent price. If you are a casual listener, or a die hard; you can get the thousand dollar receiver, or have fun with this one."
2,bought 2ea for gifts only 1 worked!,"i bought 2 for Xmas gifts both arrived in time but only 1 worked.volume control was stuck wide open, factory said this sometimes happens.Well fixit! will return for full refund."
5,One of the best portable radios ever,"One of the best radios, very clear reception of local stations, high quality sound.I use it also to listen to music stations. Picks up a lot of shortwave frequencies, although some of them not as clear. Digital tuning makes it easy to find stations. The price was good also, some stores charge like $50 more."
1,did not perform to expectations,"I purchased this as a gift for my father, it played well as an AM FM radio, but not as a shortwave radio. My father was disappointed, so I returned the radio. The radio is presently enroute back to amazon (the first item I ever returned!). I have been a loyal amazon customer, so hopefully my reimbursement will come back to me with ease."
4,"Good product, great service!",Product was as described. Service was quick and convenient. Recommend this seller highly!
3,"Grundig G4000A advisory April 7, 2011","I purchased this radio from Amazon just over a month ago, and am happy with the unit. It receives AM and FM as good as most any other portable. The shortwave and single side band do function, but are not a strong point. The included wind-up antenna really does work to increase the shortwave signal. The batteries seem to last a long time, and I have never used the wal-wart except to check how well it worked. The unit is very easy to tune, and the memorys work well. The only improvements I would like are a proper handle to carry it around (I don't like the lanyard system) and the display needs a better light for night viewing. Overall a lot of good radio for an incredibly cheap price."
1,Hi hopes,"I had high hopes for my new G4000A. It arrived!! I programed it for 25 stations and sat back to scan my selection. The transition between stations was annoying because of a loud cracking sound when it went from one station to another. It bothered me. Maybe I am use to my very old, (15years) Radio Shack DX-375, which makes a silent transition. I tuned to 570 a.m out of L.A. I live in Rosarito Beach, Mexico, 150 mi. south of L.A.I could hear it but so weak I could not understand what they were saying. Compared it to 5 other portables I have and everyone of them came in loud and clear. I will try to send it back. There must be something wrong with it because I have read so many great reviews."
1,Faulty battery!,"I purchased this item and shipped it out of US, but it was not working and I lost 30$ of the shipping charges! It looks good in manufacturing but it was not recognized by my laptop, I tested my Sony Vaio SZ120 with other batteries and it was working, but this one no! consider that you may face such a chance to receive a faulty one!"
3,"Not even a bare bones collection, but great music here","Cozy's work should need to be compiled in a box set maybe, and a very extensive one. He has worked with most of the major british rock and heavy metal bands from the UK, such as Rainbow, Whitesnake, Black Sabbath, Brian May, Jeff Beck, Emerson Lake & Powell, Peter Green, Jon Lord... I't impossible to compile his best work in a single disc. This collection features tracks from only three of his solo albums: ""Over the top"" (1979), ""Tilt"" (1981) and Octopuss (1983) All the material is instrumental, with a variety of styles: rock, fusion, blues, progressive rock... and features performances by Jeff Beck, Jon Lord, Gary Moore and Jack Bruce. It's a very musical approach, since there's a lot of top notch drumming. It's mostly musicians music, so it means it's not appealing to some of the fans. Drummers should check this release, or anything by Mr. Powell"
3,Why no Rainbow,"His best work was with Ritchie Blackmoores Rainbow, most notably Rainbow Rising, that was one of the best live shows I ever saw. And side 2 his some of his best playing.I think if your going to do a best of why no Rainbow, Sabbath, and Gary Moore. Show how well he played both Style wise, and for the song, and his ability.He was the ultimate Hard Rock Drummer, I modeled a lot of my style after him. And Bonham, and Paice, and Bozzio, and and and"
2,Comp Plan Basics,OK if you are a newcomer to comp plans but if you're looking for more detailed help on how to construct your own plan then you'll need to look elsewhere.
3,MLM Compensation Pay Plans,Book was informative - Would recommend this book for any one interested or considering getting involved with a MLM program or Relationship Marketing Program
4,nice table,"Just put my bosch RA1181 router table together, from the table upwards seems to be heavy duty and well engineered was a little disapointed with the plastic base, would have been better if it was at least thicker material. also the on/off switch is mickey mouse, I built a mobile stand for mine and installed a good on/off switch on front corner so it can be turned off with your knee or a slap of your hand. I think I am going to like this set up just fine."
1,Table is not flat,"When I laid the straight edge accross the table to level the throat plate I discovered that neither the table, nor the throat plate were flat. If you will be using it for joinery it will not work for you."
2,Not Flat,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the top on mine is far from flat. There is more than 1/16 inch valley in the middle - making accurate routing impossible. Unfortunately, i had mine more than a year before i noticed the problem ( i'm just an occasional woodworker), and now i'm stuck with it..."
5,Beyond Excellent for the Price,I have been using the RA1181 Router Table for well over a year and it does everything it is suppose to do better than I expected. The table is light but VERY sturdy when bolted down (I bolted the table to a flat 3/4 base and bolt the base to the work table I choose to use - enabling me to bring the router table to the work area or bring the work to the table -- bolted down in my shop). Assembly was easy. The table arrived in excellent (that word again!) condition and was operational with a Craftsman Router in less than ninety minutes. I use this router table EVERY day making furniture and it has always done what I have asked of it excellently.
1,Awful Building Experience Not So Great Finished Product,Directions referenced screws and nuts that were not in the box. Pictures were very vague about positions of different item. Finished product not worth the hassle of putting it together.
5,Bosch router table,"perfect for the beginner! with feather boards and easy adjustments even the clumsy can make a good job of it. if the table was deeper, so you could use a feather board in the miter guide on wider pieces of wood, and if there was more adaptability in the router mounting plate it would be even better. I found, despite the large quantity of holes in the plate, most routers all only fit one set of holes, or none at all. Still it made me look good!"
3,A fair table.,"The Bosch RA1181 benchtop router table came out at a retail price of $179.99 on 7-30-2006, so Amazon's List Price of $358.75 is slightly exaggerated.I purchased mine in 2009 on sale at my local Home Depot for $118.95. But for a plastic table, with a slightly convex top when I got it, It finally settled in and was mostly flat after a few practice runs with some scrap wood, and after I bolted it down to a hardwood work bench to spread the plastic sides a bit to take most of the bow out.That negates the portability of the table, but it did make it more flat with less downward bend on the edges of the work surface. For the price I paid, and the bit of extra work that I had to do to make it work as it should, it was a fair deal.Any price between $130.00 to $145.00 is a fair deal, counting inflation, but as built and designed, for the serious woodworker, a bit more work in setting it up properly and bolting it down to a flat, rigid surface, is required."
3,Not the best,"It went together nicely. After I began using it, I noticed some imperfections in the casting of the table. This must be a second, you know, one that was rejected during inspection. It has given me a bad feeling about items bought at such a discount here at Amazon."
4,very solid,"Very solid and well built. I use it lot to build boxes. I bolted it to a stand that works well and keeps it steady and at the right position for me to use w/o hurting my back. Easy to change bits and easy adjustments of the fence. Meets my needs and expectations. In hindsight I might have opted for a more professional model, but I really think this is adequate for hobby work."
5,Good Deal,This appears to be an excellent table. Great Price. I haven't used it yet but have checked it for level and assembled it. Assembly takes a little time. Very satisfied.
2,No one will give me an answer,"When the package arrived I was not home, but I have a covered front porch. The box was in horrible shape, it looked like someone kicked it all over. I want to ask a question about the product b4 returning, but I can't seem to have that option. Another thing was the entire bottem of the box was opened, and with this being something you have to put together yourself, How do I know if all the peices are in the box without ripping the rest of the box apart. Since I bought it as a Xmas gift, Im not sure what to do. Anyone have a suggestion? Cause if I take the whole thing out of the box& something is missing, they won't allow me to return it."
5,Suitable for my purposes,I was confused because it seemed like a rather large table just to hold our modem and router. So after a while we used it for Halloween and set it up with a speaker to play spooky sounds while a dummy gets decapitated. The head sails over the trick or treaters and its all good fun. Some of the features on this table aren't really necessary just to hold a router.
4,The best value per dollar.,"I read a lot of reviews and looked at a lot of different models and brands. I have found this to be the best in quality and versatility for the cost. Once assembled, it is very sturdy. Leveling the router base is tricky, I fine tuned it by running some scrap through and adjusting the deck until I got the desired result. The dual outlet power base makes the use of a portable dust collection vacuum quite simple. If you a fulltime carpenter, you'll have no use or need for this product, but, for us novice,light project, weekend carpenters, this is the best way to go."
3,Good for a starter table,"I'm sure you've read other reviews about the functionality of this router table so I don't need to get into details about its merits and flaws. This was my first router-table set-up several years ago. For a sub $200 table its not bad but its far from perfect. If you are curious about getting into table routing without spending more than $200, this product is for you. Just remember to mount it well to a table/bench or stand."
4,Decent Enough,"The base is a little flimsy and the assembly seemed a bit loose. The table, fence, dust hood, featherboards, and inserts make this table a great value. I did not like the powerswitch which is a little cumbersome to use. If I had the time I would have just built my own cabinet and purchased a professional lift for micro adjustments. Overall I would recommend this router table to people on a budget with simple needs for routing."
4,"For the price, this was the one.","Didn't expect perfect. More vibration than would be a larger heavier stationary model. A previous post talked about the insert not being flat. I experienced that also. But, for just under $200, and big, sturdy, yet portable, this is a great buy. The dust collection worked better that I expected. Some dust escaped, but stayed contained to the table top or underneath the table. Not floating around the room. I routed MDF right inside the house, in the room I was custom trimming. It actually worked better than taking it outside with out the shop vac attached."
5,Best Table top Router Under $200,"THis is a top notch Router table. Very High Quality right out of the box. Solid Construction, easy to assemble, Precise table top with accurate fence and leveling system. HUGE work area is a real plus and This entire unit functions like it was truly designed by a wood worker. Dust port works really well, and this table is just plain fun to admire and use."
5,Nice Table,"This table is easy to operate and assemble, Fit my bosch router fine and very little needs to be done under the table for adjusting height etc. I'd highly recommend this table, especially for someone new to using router tables."
5,Quality Product,"Just finished assembling the table with the Bosch under-table base and cutting a few pieces. This product exceeded my expectations. The manual is clear, the unit assembles with precision, the table is flat, and the mounting plate is sturdy and easily leveled.In my view, using this table without a permanently mounted under-table base would be a pain given that the fence must be pulled to remove the mounting plate. The fence is easy to remove but it was worth the extra cost to avoid the hassle of dealing with the fence as well as removing and reinstalling the plastic router base every time I used the table. The aux base for use with my Bosch router makes for a very nice combination.I am very pleased with this purchase and expect to be using it for many years."
1,Warped,"I cannot recommend this item. The table wasn't even close to being flat, and what's more useless than a router table with a warped surface? A cast aluminum router table seems like such a good idea, but, to make it flat enough, it probably requires a machining and/or grinding and/or lapping operation after casting. If you look at good quality table saws with metal tables, you will see the marks from the machining operation. After returning this router table, I found a much better one at Lowe's under the Skil brand name for $139."
3,Used supposed to be new,"We bought this for my hubby's birthday, it was supposed to be new, but we could tell it had been opened before. There were scratches on the fence and the legs. It was not worth the hassle of returning, but I was not happy to give my hubby something that wasn't brand new for his birthday."
2,Warped Table,"Great value but table top was warped. 1/8 inch out, center to right side. Otherwise, I liked the table so I called Bosch to try to order just a replacement top but no luck. The Bosch rep claimed there is a history of tops damaged in shipping and the defect was not due to manufacturing. The table shipped in the original Bosch packaging, with no additional outer packaging from Amazon. The table weighs about 40 pounds. There was no visible damage to the box or the contents. Too bad because I would have preferred to keep the table. I returned the table with Amazon's typical superb no questions asked return policy."
5,Quality product - but mediocre manual,"No warped table here. The cast table, router plate and fence is heavy duty and high quality. Took about 3 hours to assemble due mainly to the poorly written manual. Diagrams of the nuts & bolts should be to scale to aid in locating which of the numerous size bolts should be used. Assembly diagrams should be larger or at least critical areas should have an exploded view."
4,Good episode. Weird presentation.,"I don't know why, but on this presentation of the episode ""backwards"" (as viewed on my PS3), all the backwards-spoken lines' subtitles have been blacked out. The boxes remain, but they're solid black.It's a fun episode, but I can't recall if it had the subtitles originally, or if this is something that was added and then sloppily ""removed"" on Amazon."
5,No Problems. Strong product.Heavy Duty so far,"very pleased to receive the socket. nice price, fast shipping. I have already saved myself some hard labor by using the impact socket on a few trailer hitch ball couplers. great product, no problems or complaints yet and don't expect to have any trouble.I'd recommend these for all garages and home shops."
5,An absolute classic,Sweetnighter is a classic. Weather Report still had an acoustcal sound. Maybe that was the playing of Miroslav on acoustic bass. I think Wayne Shorter seems less lost in all the electronics that marks the later recordings by this group. A Must have for any Weather Report or fusion fan.
5,Some guy in Michigan,"Sweetnighter is one ""bad a--"" work of art. Like Grandpa said ""they just don't make these anymore"". Music like this is far too risky and organic to produce during this period of Western culture. Besides the songs mentioned in the previous reviews check out ""Manolete"" on Sweetnighter. If you can ""get it"" it is one of the most beautiful tunes ever created. I'd like to have it played at my funeral. Maybe I'll fake my death and watch the reactions. That would be a trip!"
4,No JACO but still very good,"Miroslav Vitous is fine, but you cn really tell that Jaco Pastorius on bass later pushed these guys to the top. He is the one who really created the excitement on Heavy Weather.Of course, Mysterious Traveller was another great record with Alphonso Johnson on bass.Then, add Alex Acuña and Manolo Badrena to Jaco and WOW!!! One of the greatest jazz groups of all time. TRANSCENDENTAL is the word."
3,Reference book on Mediterranean vegetables,This A-Z book describes around 200 vegetables and provides some recipes. The list is very exhaustive and also provide the name in latin and different languages plus some history and growing advice. We also get a number of recipes but not many. This is clearly a reference book and if that is what you want it is highly recommended. It is not really a cookbook
2,Seventies Syrup,"Oh, it's not a bad album, really. In fact, it does have nice moments, such as ""Good Evening Mr and Mrs America..."" But the rest? Nnnnnah, it just doesn't reflect much of the band's talent (I saw 'em live in '74, and they were terrific). Too formulaic, waaay too pedestrian and predictable, much like that no-cajones stuff that Chuck Mangione was doing around that time. It is ear candy, best played in the dentist's office or at your next seventies-themed party. Still, I do like Mr and Mrs America..."
4,"Funky, Swinging '70's jazz-rock","In this cd, Tom Scott and crew straddle the fence playing music that would at once appeal to the masses as well as jazz fans. I think they succeeded at both.The musicians are all excellent and are a cohesive unit. Max Bennett and John Guerin were established studio musicians, Robben Ford an outstanding guitarist. Perhaps the only unknown was keyboardest, Larry Nash. But Nash holds his own in grand fashion with the others.There is nice variety in the tunes. There are some polyrhythmic pieces such as ""Backfence Cattin',"" some outright swingers such as ""Rock Island Rocket"" and the 8 plus minute tour-de-force ""Mondo"", featuring a well-integrated drum solo by Guerin.The sound quality is excellent with good stereo separation. This cd is a fine introduction to Tom Scott, who was above the rank and file jazz-rock artists of the 1970s."
2,No one answeres the phone!,"When we first got the hose cart it had a flat tire due to sharp edges on the rim. Finally got a person at the toll free number, on the 9th call, and they shipped a new wheel and tire. No major rust problems after 2 years but a brass fitting froze and split this winter and I'm on call 13 to the company with no answer or return call. I've left a message each time. It's a great idea but poorly constructed and even more poorly supported."
1,made in China,"spring 08 I purchased this so called commercial industrial heavy duty hose reel cart, by mid summer it was rusting badly, by fall the paint was starting to peel off.I brought in to my hose during the winter and a month ago May 09 I power brushed the complete cart which was totally rusted,and brought the entire cart to bare metal. I primed and painted the complete cart then I had to replace the four o-rings in the water head. I basically had to rebuild the entire thing or throw it away.All I can say is this is another example of some company here in the United States moving there operation overseas for profit. I don't know that for sure, I'm just guessing.Ten years earlier I purchased a wall mounted reel made in the United States, and to date it has very little rust showing, what rust is there in around screw heads, I'm willing to guess I will never have to paint that one.J.W.G Minneapolis"
3,needs direction,I do not think it is a good as Shelter. It seems to lack direction. The violins do not fit the music. Album was more melancholy than meditative.
2,Lost Focus,"Derek Wilson needed an editor to remind him of his thesis: that life in the court of Henry VIII was dangerous for those who sought to share their sovereign's power and ambition. Much of the material in this book does not support that thesis, and the narrative that does support the thesis could have been summarized with far less detail.Addtionally, I found the writing dull and the scholarship sloppy. I do not think that this book added to my knowledge of the Tudor era; I had hoped for new insights from the stated angle of the book, but found only repetition and redundancy."
3,Solid but confusing history,"There is no doubt that Mr Wilson has been a serious student of the period and that his book is the result of many years of dedicated research. It is also clear that Wilson needed a good editor. In page after page, the book becomes a jumble of information. Each fact is presented well, but the overall impression is a confused and confusing piece of work.It has a lot of information, but it is undermined by poor narrative and the inability to simply tell the story. He has taken a complex topic addressed it in a complex manner and then failed to resolve the tension between detail and sweep."
5,amazing,"I had this on album for many years and was happy to find it on CD. Of all my blues albums, this is one of my favorites. Real down home blues played on a slightly out-of-tune piano in what sounds like someone's basement. Billy Boy Arnold's harp and backing vocals are the prefect compliment."
3,"Johnny Jones with Billy Boy Arnold - Johnny Jones with Billy Boy Arnold (Alligator, 1979)","Great Maceo Merriweather influenced deep and non-tiring Chicago Blues piano at its best performed by the artist who backed Muddy Waters and Elmore James. All tracks are Blues classics performed classically.

1,Canidae Platinum changed formula ???,"I am very unhappy that Canidae did not mention the formula change. My Pomrerain has lost 1/3 of his weight since the last bag I bought. I had noticed the color in the food looked lighter but than he got diarrhea and now has been diagnosed with diabetes. He had been doing very well since I had put him on Canidae Platinum 2 1/2 years ago until this change.I know he is an older dog but I thought I was giving him some of the best food for him.Hopefully not many people have had to experience this with their dogs.I know the diabetes may not be due to the food but the diarrhea ???I had my kittens ,now cats, on Felidae but now I will consider another brand. The bag got smaller but the price stayed the same and I do not want them getting sick also."
4,Invisible Learning,"I bought this placemat along with several others to periodically rotate between my kids. If they're in a quiet mood or are the last slow eaters left at the table, they often end up staring at the map, comparing sizes of countries, recognizing the names of places they've heard on TV, in movies, books, etc. And there's no silly cartoons, flags, or other distractions; just political boundaries and capital cities. Makes learning seamless and part of their daily living! The placemat seems as well made as could be for a plastic placemat and I expect to hold up for a long time."
3,I saw same one in Manhattan,"An old man was selling the same product at the streets of Manhattan last year for $3 :) But hey, if you'd like to order online and comes at your door, you don't need to travel to Manhattan! It is very nice and easy to clean."
3,Quality is good but maps is too dense,"I bought this product as replacement for world placemat that I purchased from department store last year. That item was torn after six months. It was highly readable and pleasing to look at.When I received this, it was packed nicely. Quality of plastic and design is good. But, map is too dense and not easily readable. My six year old daughter did not like this first hand. Colors are little bit too bright.They could have made map more readable and easy to understand."
2,Not worth $5,A laminated map that is hard to read the smaller countries. We will use at the dinner table. This is a $1 dollar store item.
3,Disappointed,"The book was so much better. I had the audio version of the book and it was fun, delightful, fast-paced, exciting, and enchanting. So, I ordered the DVD. It was clinical, dark and dreary with horrible music. There was nothing dark or dreary about the book. How they came up with that adaptation I have no idea. I could almost hear the director say: ""Okay! We'll shoot this scene, then that one, then the next one."" I felt the human element was totally lost in the movie. There was no character development. I never really connected with either girl or Gentleman. Even with the book, there was enough connection with Gentleman that I was sorry to see him die.I was really expecting to see another great movie like ""Tipping the Velvet."" This version of the movie was very disappointing to me."
2,The book is AMAZING -- the movie is NOT,"I absolutely loved reading Fingersmith. It is an incredible, complex, beautiful book with unexpected twists, rich characters, and a wonderful, suspenseful plot. It is one of my favorite books.I was therefore very disappointed when I watched this movie. Basically the movie, though mostly sticking to Sarah Waters' plot, destroys the magic of the book. The pace is wrong, the whole thing plods along drudgingly. I had to stop watching it after the first disk, and couldn't bring myself to finish watching it for months. To be fair, the second disk is better than the first, but not by much. And it's not that I just dislike movie adaptations of great books. The film version of Tipping the Velvet is excellent. It's merely that this adaptation of Fingersmith is NOT.My recommendation is to skip the terrible movie and read the book!"
2,Sooooooooooooooooooooooo slow,"The story is pretty good, but the series are so slow. I would much prefer to faster pacedVanity Fair (A&E;, 1998)."
2,Big disappointment.,"After reading the book, I'd heard that BBC had done a mini-series of it. They usually impress me with their accuracy and character depiction. This was not the case this time. Not only did they miss the mark on the characters and scramble the sequence of events, they added more sex scenes. Actually, the sex scene in the book was mostly alluded to and was more of an emotional love scene. The movie went for the blow by blow approach, with 2 more scenes that never occured. Furthermore, they left out essential story line information that makes this tale a thriller. If I had not read the book, I still would have found the movie weak and flimsy. I was totally unimpressed."
3,Fingersmith,"It was pretty good. I would rate it as 3 stars. It's not a favorite, but I'm glad I watched it. Now that I have seen it, I wouldn't recommend it for a video library or anything."
5,I Love It,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. I don't read much these days, so I am very grateful that Sarah Waters' brilliant books have been made into movies. I love the way the story is told, you get to see the plot unfold in different ways through different characters' eyes. The actresses are beautiful and sexy, the acting is superb, lots of twists and turns in the plot, and a great ending. What more can I ask for in a movie?"
2,Totally perplexed,"I never read the book. I rented the DVD and while I enjoyed the body of the movie, the ending and many parts of the movie left me saying, ""Huh?! What's up?"". To me the ending ruined the movie. What happened? Why did that happen? And what was the purpose of it?? It didn't make sense to me. What did Maud & Gentleman have to gain by it? What did they need Sue for if that's what they'd planned? I'm just confused by it."
4,"Wow, a lesbian story with a great plot!","Fingersmith is definitely worth adding to your collection. I bought this movie on a whim based on a hot clip on you tube and was not disappointed. The only thing that keeps me from giving a 5 star rating, is the length (3hr); however, the twists will not disappoint."
5,I Love this mustard,This is my favorite mustard ever. I can't even buy it in my city anymore which makes me mad. This is by far the best tasting sweet hot mustard ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"""Black"" Tells it Like It Is","47th street is alive in this novel. Ojikutu captures the language and the culture and presents it in rich prose.As a Chicago South-Sider, I found the story of Mookie and J.C. to be very realistic. As a reader, I felt the anxiety, the fear, the ambition, the disappointment, and even the thrill that these two experience as they come of age in the steet game and eventually become two of its major players.This is much more than a story of urban hustlers, it is the story of men stuggling to first find their manhood and eventually striving to become ""the man"". The story is intelligently told, vivid, and engrossing."
5,A Very Good Book,This is a very well written and intense story of two boys who grew up in Chicago in the early 60's in rough neighborhoods and the journey they had from childhood to adulthood. One of my fav's.
4,It's fun to be amazed,"I read this book aloud for my tween sons -- a little every night. I remembered reading Ripley books when I was young, and I enjoyed introducing the series to my boys. It was fun to be amazed at the weird things people do research on and the often surprising results they get.Each page is illustrated with artwork and has a manageable amount of text -- making the book appealing for struggling readers. There is also a section with photographs in the middle of the book. Unfortunately, the text that goes with those photographs was basically copied from other sections of the book -- no new content there."
2,Strange science does sell?,"I think actual science is better than ""bright colored tadpoles taste bad""?Maybe real stuff like how genetically altered rice, wheat and corn/ maisehas made possible the current level of population?Or how the sunspot cycle is at a minimum right nowthat hasn't occurred since 1600?Packaging freaks, horrors and scientist in the same rapper seems likesaying all geniuses are mad or nearly so? It just isn't true.Counterproductive is probably the word: kids like dinosaurs and bugsnot Dr. Frankenstein and his monster.Most scientists are ordinary people who are a little smarter anda little more interested in the world around them.Improving children's trust of science and scientists is probablybetter than making them afraid?"
3,Emissary of Light,"This ia a fantastical tale of a man's trek to find children who are ""emissaries of light."" I found it a bit too weird to believe, though he claims it is true. It creates an interesting picture of a war-torn area. Perhaps it will appeal to you!"
5,wonderful condition on used book,The book was in great condition. I had read the book previously and knew I wanted to own a copy. very good book
2,Poorly Written New Age Novel,"Author claims that this is a true story, but really this is an amateurish novel about a mystical community devoted to a bland version of ""A Course in Miracles."" If you are really into ACIM, you may like this; for others this book is not recommended. One must wonder, if Twyman is so enlightened, why did he attempt to pass this off as a true story? He has publically admitted that the story is loosely based on his travels in Croatia and has suggested that he made up ""Teacher"" to make the story more interesting."
4,very best of Rainbow,"I am a fan of Rainbow when it comes to the Joe Lynn Turner and RJD era, my first introduction to Rainbow was ""BLACKMORE'S RAINBOW"", since i listened to the guitar intro of Man on the Silver Mountain i knew it was going to be a good album; i think Blackmore should have taken more time to look for better singers besides the ones mentioned above, sometimes Blackmore's guitar work isn't matched with the other singers voice and the music sounds too mellow for Blackmore's musical skills.Anyway is a good album to appreciate a good guitar player and a gifted singer like RJD, if you think you're musically educated buy this album or ""CATCH THE RAINBOW, THE ANTHOLOGY"", you won't be dissapointed."
5,excelente,"excelente , solo puedo decir que este debiera ser un doble cd para tener más horas de excelente musica de un grupo no tan reconocido pero que ha influenciado a miles de bandas , 100 % recomendable"
5,Satisfying.,"I found out about this band from my grandfather who's an avid classic rock fan, but was surprised that so many of my friends really had no clue about this band (whilst knowing about Deep Purple or The Doors). The song ""Man on the Silver Mountain"" was definately a song you can catch on to easily, and Rainbow is so melodic that it can draw in a listener easily. If you like bands like Deep Purple, The Who, or Blue Oyster Cult, you will def be satisfied by Rainbow."
5,rainbow,great working with them happy with them will buy again i looked all over for this i would tell friends
5,Great CD,"If you love Deep Purple, you will love this CD, full of long lost favorites. Great Cd!!! Definitely recommend it!!"
3,Contains the Essentials,"As long as Stone Cold and Street of Dreams appeared here, the CD is worth the money ~ these songs are unforgettable powerhouse hits that will remind you of what it was like to be young in the Eighties.But, sorry to say that unless you're a head-banging, hard core metal fan, (or just love R. Blackmore's talent) you won't find much else to really enjoy."
3,"Solid, unspectacular hits collection","If your really a Blackmore or Rainbow fan, you already own all of the classic albums and there is no reason to pick up ""Very Best Of."" Aside from the interesting family tree, this collection adds nothing to the previous output. It is kinda fun to hear the progression of the music over 9 years rolled up into 77 minutes, though. But it also makes you realize how fluffy the material had become in the Turner era. (Why did DP ever have him on for Slaves and Masters?) Two classic cuts from that era: Jealous Lover and Street of Dreams. Classic cuts from the Dio-era: too many to mention."
3,Rainbow 's Best: A colorful Portrait!,An interesting pastiche of Rainbow songs with all the different personnel Blackmore used. Some of the older stuff really rocks however it can sound (a little) outdated. The latter stuff with Bonnet(Turner didnt sing Since you've been gone;Grahma Bonnet did on the album Down to Earth) and Turner in the vocal chairs and with Ex-Purple bass player Roger Glover sounds more commercial and in some cases very American oriented if not just downright slick. However the interesting part stays ofcourse the Man in Black(another guy in black) who puts his stamp thruout the album by playing his signature guitar solos on his trademark Fender Stratocaster.
4,A psychological western dealing with small-town guilt.,"Audie Murphy portrays a young outlaw who kills for money in this psychological thriller, a genre of Westerns, that deals with the impact of people's pasts in a small western town. Chaos breaks out when the threat of consequence for past immoralities causes townspeople to face their guilt. Subtle, simple, Murphy depicts a cool, level-headed killer amused by the effects his presence in town is having, yet occupied only with killing the man he was sent to murder. In this town, there is no name on the bullet, and everyone thinks its headed for them. Great flick."
3,"An edgy performance from an underrated talent, Audie Murphy","This is a very watchable Western featuring Audie Murphy and co-starring Charles Drake (Audie's co-star in ""To Hell and Back""). If this film had been made ten years later, it would have been a good vehicle for Clint Eastwood. Audie Murphy plays a Western ""hit man"" who is famous for killing his prey not by out-and-out murder, but through self-defense or other means. Charles Drake plays the town doctor who becomes friendly with Audie, despite his personal feelings about Audie's quest.I was pleasantly surprised to find that Universal has released this on video - hopefully, they'll release some more. If you like Westerns, see this film - if you're not familiar with Audie Murphy's work or have heard less than flattering things about his acting, you will be pleasantly surprised!"
4,Arbor Review,"The arbor was delivered on the date promised with no damage. Assembly was easy. The anchors supplied fit over the legs in four corners and if they had to be hammered into the ground this may be a problem as one side of the suport would be in line with the frame no matter how it was positioned. They were also finished in a color differant from the arbor, we had to paint them to blend better. To prevent the possibility of corrosion, I built a frame for two footings and posistioned the arbor with the anchors in place and poured the footing. It came out fine as the arbor is level and straight on all corners. Time will tell if the zinc coating on the arbor will extend it's life. We were very satisfied with the final results."
4,One of Sean Penn's best roles,"I missed this in the original run and decided to grab it. Mick O'Brien (Penn) kills the little brother of a notable gangster and is sent to jail. It's not just a revenge tale, but a decently finished biography of a young man in trouble.This is one of Penn's strongest performances. Well worth watching and owning if you are a Penn fan.Rebecca Kyle, December 2008"
3,A good movie,"I saw this when it first came out in the theaters and have finally got this on DVD. If you are in late 30's or early 40's, it will show that people have not changed much."
3,Approach this dvd with caution,"The film is great, but those of you who already own the original Anchor Bay dvd which as been available for years dvd should be weary, since this is just a repackaging. As many of you know, Starz bought out Anchor Bay awhile back, so the re-release and new packaging reflects that. No new features or upgraded transfer--just the commentary and original trailer like on the AB disc."
5,THE FIGHTING IRISH,"It is a shame that nowadays when you ask someone if they have seen Bad Boys they automaticaly think of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence because the 1983 Bad Boys is far superior to the later Bad Boys movie.Set almost entirly inside the claustophobic boy's prison, this movie is one of Penn's best performances, and that is saying alot.Penn quickly rises throgh the ranks in the prison and overcomes alot of adversity to become the top dog, and soon learns that earned respect is a sweet thing."
1,John is right,"After reading John's review of Bad Boys, I did a little research. Indeed, the DVD version is 19 minutes shorter than the theatrical release. Thanks John, you saved me some money. Now to the rights holder out there, how about releasing a completed version."
1,"""Bad"" Script/Acting","Sean Penn is overexposed nd overrated but certainly has proved self capable in other outings. He fails here first as the ""hard delinquent"" whose enviroment led to his crimes and second as the ""sensitive inmate"" who sees the light and just wants to go home.Eric Gurry appears as Horowitz, playing the Jewish stereotype- craftiness and comic relief - a stupid casting attempt at lightening a grim reformatory flick.While Penn is unbuyable as Chicago street tough, he is worse in a scene where he expresses sorrow over a family tragedy.Penn was lucky people liked his Jeff Spicoli character enough for Hollywood to give him another chance in ""At Close Range"", a much better outing for Mr.Penn."
1,Bad Boys.,"I was rooting for Esai Morales Character the Whole time not because I'm a Fan of somebody who would be named ""Esai"",But because of my personal Distaste for all things Penn,that being said there is a lesson to be learned here to you Criminals out there,especially in Chi-Town. Do The Crime and Pay the Time, I have seen Better After-School Specials."
3,bad boys,bad boys i saw this movie about 3 years ago this was a good movie I'm 15 this was one of my best movies
2,Bad Boys,"loved this movie from the 80's,which is why I purchased it, but my DVD copy froze up and skipped quite a bit in middle of movie."
4,Bad Boys,The original Bad Boys was a very well done movie by a then young Sean Penn. Awesome acting and suspense keeps you glued to the screen to see just what will happen next as two hated enemies collide.
3,It was a good movie!,"First of all, I wasn't a huge Sean Penn fan at the time. However, with that being said, this movie made me a huge fan after I saw it. Frankly, with the exception of ""Mystic River"" and ""I am Sam"" this has got to be my favorite right among those. Don't let me forget, Esai Morales also does a great job as well. I think this movie was ahead of it's time, and it opened the door for a lot of prison dramas of this genre. With that being said, I do think that there's a lot more to prison than what was shown. I don't think they showed all of the brutality in it's fullness that goes along with prison life. I think they showed just enough for you to get the point, but it wasn't as explicit or raunchy as a lot of other films. I wouldn't call this a classic, but it did show that Sean Penn has what it takes to be taken seriously after playing ""Jeff Spicoli"" in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" which was more teen comedy fun, and way less edgy or gritty than this."
2,It seems realistic.,"If this is a true depiction of juvenile prison, then there is no future hope for juvenile offenders.I could swear that I have seen two endings to this movie. In one, the Penn character kills the hispanic character; in the other, he stabs the ground and walks away. Are there two endings out there, or is it my imagination?"
4,Movie I like that I wanted to purchase,I saw this movie years ago. I wanted add it to my collection. I collect many older movies that I have seen years ago.
5,SINGLE MOTHER'S OF TEENAGE BOYS NEED TO OWN THIS,"I give this movie 5 stars, it holds up as well today as it did when I was a teenager. Now I'm a single Mother to a houseful of boys, including a grandson I'm raising. I'm using it as a warning tool. Best of luck to all the other single Moms out there with troubled boys."
2,Bad Boys Sean Penn,"I only bought this movie because I wanted to see Isai Morales' performance, and he was very, very young, but as always, great. I can't stand Sean Penn, who is VERY overrated. I did not like the story and I wish I had not bought the movie. I don't intend to watch it again, so maybe I can find someone to give it to. DON'T BUY IT!"
4,A Very Good Early Movie with Sean Penn,"Just happened to watch this one tonight and really enjoyed it very much. It was made in 1983 so you have to get your mind around not seeing the super duper effects that you are used to seeing in the more current movies. Sean Penn is brilliant in this movie as a young boy who accidentally kills another even younger boy and then gets sent to Juvenile lockup. The move from bottom of the stack rank to the top in the prison is priceless as is the same sulking eyes that we are used to seeing in his more recent movies. The pace of the movie does leave a bit to be desired however and I think they could have cut off about 10 or 15 minutes. That said, the dialogue is great. The acting by Sean Penn is very very good and it is a must see if you want to familiarize yourself with his early work."
3,These guys have great potential!,"Daara J is an up and coming young group from Senegal. They combine reggae, hip hop and traditional Senegalese music. Father Freddy has an amazing voice! The album is a bit unpolished and does not do justice to their true capabilities, but it is a good start. Their live performances are much stronger than the c.d., but if you like to listen to struggling local artists with an original sound and amazing potential, this is a keeper."
5,MECO is the HIGHWAY to my imagiation.,"MECO, I went on an endless search to find the CD you put out after I heard the funky Starwars disco song on the radio. I bought it.. loved it then lost it. I couldn't live without it so I bought a new one. This CD's music is so upbeat and positive it'll put you in a good mood. Its a happy CD ! Your music has let out more of my creativity Meco. Believe it or not, I did a project in art class that was dedicated to you. It entered my schools art show and won first place for my level. (art 3) The theme was a robot disco. I imagined it up all on my own just by listening to your music. Honest to goodness, I later found out about your album ""moondancer"" I was freaked out on how close my original idea came to the cover art that LP. You are like no other Composer I know, best of luck to you and your music. I'll always be there to buy what comes out next! THE CD JIVES people ! BUY IT ! Swampbug"
1,Dreadfully Boring,"This review concerns the original 1955 edition and the revised 1975 edition which is a shorter version of the original. A search for stolen antique furniture sends Nancy, Bess and George to the Amish country of Pennsylvania. This book was sooooo boring. The mystery was not interesting and typically the ""exciting"" chapter endings had little or nothing to do with the mystery. There was a secret connected with one of the pieces of furniture, but you learn so little about it until the end of the book that I just didn't care and when it was revealed it was dull anyway. The end of the book is terrible as the crooks are caught without any help from Nancy. Unless you want to read the entire set, I'd skip this one."
3,Not a great buy,"My little brother turned 18 and moved in with me, so I bought this bed to put in my sons room so they could be roomies. I have purchased other do-it-yourself furniture from amazon and was quite pleased with the results, so I bought this one with high hopes. It wasn't terribly difficult to put together and holds the weight of my 6'1"" 215lb baby brother, so I can't really complain. But one of the drawers doesn't fit right and another one fell apart. I'm sure the one that fell apart can be fixed with some wood glue, but it's a pain in the butt to put it aside and let it dry undusturbed. On top of that the whole thing sways when you get into bed and feels reminiscent of an old waterbed I used to have. It serves it's purpose and that's what I bought it for, but I wish I would have spent an extra $100-150 on something nicer."
3,Tiny Drawers,This bed will be fine for our 3.5 year old however the drawers are tiny and don't pull out all the way. I thought they would be the depth of the bed but they are not. They can maybe hold socks and underwear but are not a replacement for a chest of drawers!! Overall it is fine for a kids bed.
4,Nil Lara--one of my favorites and always great to have more,"Nil Lara's first CD is one of my desert island discs. While ""Da"" may not attain the heights quite as consistently as ""Nil Lara"", there's enough of that brilliance to make it a wise purchase.In the musical world of over-hyped pretenders, Nil shines as unique and deserves our support."
2,What time is it? You Mean Now?,"What Time is It? You Mean Now?Reads like it was writen by a 10th grader. All I got from it was the list of Yogi Berra's ""Quotes"". Easier to just print them of the internet."
3,"A useful, but dated resource","While this is clearly a pioneer and classic work in its field, there are, today, newer works that surpass this volume, first published 67 years ago, without many updates throughout its many reprints, in its usefulness. For example, the author includes literary references as well as art references (in other words, linguistic references that one does not see in art), so it is sometimes difficult to know if a particular object has different meanings ""literally"" from ""figuratively"". Additionally, the index is way too cursory, so there have been times when it has been extremely difficult to re-find something that one knows one has seen or read in the volume. A third shortfall is the use of line drawings as opposed to real photographs. There is a reason why we have the saying, ""A picture is worth 1,000 words"". Nevertheless, Williams was a ground-breaker in this area and this volume belongs in the library of anyone with a serious interest in the subject."
4,Surprise after a long time of under average productions,"As an old toto fan, I was quite disappointed with the albums after Toto - IV (which was on the edge of being plain commercial without the freshness I'd loved with the older albums). Just lately a friend gave me ""Tambu"" and told me it was a lot better again. Well, he was right. ""Gift of Faith"", the first song, comes as fresh and alive as any of their old songs (who remembers ""Manuela Run"" from the first album?), and I can't say the rest of the album is worse. Old fans would have to get used to a different drums sound since Jeff Porcaro died a couple of years ago, but I didn't have any problems coping with it. Check it out, it's really worth buying it."
4,The road goes on!,"Tambu lacks the synthesizer prominence that characterized their earlier albums, but this is a fine album nonetheless. It seems to have a bit of sadness, though. It seems Toto was still mourning the loss of Jeff Porcaro three years earlier.PS: ""Mindfields,"" Toto's latest is availale in some countries, and it's a hit in those countries. I am anxiously awaiting its domestic release!"
4,One of the bettter Toto Albums,"There are some great moments on this one. ""Slipped Away"" is my favorite, and ""Dave's gone skiing"" is an instrumental that is (if this is possible) actually kind of funny (there's a second syncopation thing that has an unexpected twist, particularly if you're a musician and have played this genre). I don't know why Toto gets slammed by critics for being technically proficient. I'm going to argue if you're interested in MUSIC in the rock genre, you're going to have to look hard before you find a band better than Toto. If memory serves, this is Simon Phillip's Toto studio album debut, and he plays great."
3,A mixed bag...,"Their 1995 effort 'Tambu'features the same great musicianship we've been accustomed to expect from this legendary band,yet not all songs are up to par.Very interesting lyrics,introspective and a bit depressed,e.g.the aftermath of broken relationships,betrayal,confusion,the need for faith,a great jazzy instrumental towards the end,lend more credit to this uneven album."
3,Not what was expected,"When I read the product description, I thought this software would be a great writing practice instrument at a great price! That is not what I got. Its easy enough to install, but if you're not a computer novice that is to be expected. The problem comes in when you attempt to use the software. The layout is complex - the user is given little or no step-to-step guidance in the writing process. In fact, the typical child would need assistance in its use. For me, this kind of defeated the purpose, as I wanted a software that would provide a instructional and fun alternative to pen and paper."
1,Saints ornament,"I have yet to hear from the vendor about where this ornament is, so I can only give zero stars and do NOT recommend the seller!"
4,"Phat and all that, trippy and cool","Luke Vibert (AKA Wagon Christ) has put out a lot of cool stuff. He's from Cornwall, UK and I've read that all he does is smoke out and loop crazy samples. You'd enjoy WC's ""Throbbing Pouch"" --a heavy recommendation..."
4,The Swan is amazing!,"Probably the best smooth jazz CD from BJ. The Swan is my all-time favourite track, i can listen to this song forever, absolute masterpiece. La Delaissado,Prospero and Quietly Crazy For You, although heavily jazzed up with somehow messy improvisations from Peter Erskine on drums have the same ""New Age"" synths that makes the Swan so extra loveable, but the Swan is more organized."
3,Hidden Treasure Found At Last!,"This is a ""black pearl"" of the Bob James discography, and one not to be overlooked at that. Recorded around the same time as FOXIE (circa. 1983), it was originally released only in Japan. This release was issued for the first time in the U. S. along with the bulk of his vintage solo material on Warner Bros, and Tappan Zee (Bob's own label). The material ranges from dreamy and graceful (""The Swan"", ""Water Music"", and ""La Delaissado""--also from Haute-Auvergne), to dizzying (""Prospero"" and ""Ensenada Madness""). The CD closes with a number by the late Mike Lawrence ( ""Quietly Crazy For You""). THE SWAN is truly a treasure in every sense!"
2,"Good idea, No directions","Ordered two of these for a toy box I'd built. The mechanism isn't robust enough to keep the lid from slamming though. Maybe my lid's too heavy. Nonetheless, there were no mesurement instructions as to placement included so I had to guess. Wouldn't recommend this product."
4,Rule Of The Bone,"This is an excellent book which portrays many of the key factors of teenage life without any beautification. While being interesting the story shows historical pieces of Jamaica and an internal view of Rastafarianism. Banks masters the languages of the characters, from Chappies punk to I-man's ""Dat be irie mon."" Au sable is closely resembling the reality of the small dumpy towns that cover the country, and the small families living in trailors with drug and alcohal issues. Banks shows all these things amazingly well, but it was not one of my favorite books primarily because although it was interesting it was not related to my interests."
3,After picking up this book I learned alot.,"This story was about a young middle class teenager named Chappie who is trying yo find his identity. It is about his experiences after he leaves home to make a life of his own. it is about a quest to find someone who cares. He is faced with sex, drugs, and lies. In the end he learns more from three people then he could in a life time because he found hisself."
4,This book was down to earth in today's society,I thought this book dealed with real stories that happen to some kids today.I give Russell Banks a great deal of respect for being able to write from a 14 year old's point of view. It's definately a book that you don't want to put down.
4,Typical Banks,"Saying Rule of the Bone is typical Banks is a good thing. He writes compelling stories with an edge that never lets you feel too comfortable or become too close to the characters since they're generally such sad human beings. My wife says he's smug, I say he's a realist. However, compared to other Banks novels, Bone is a joyride. Plenty or lighter moments and a protagonist who's spunk makes him worth cheering for if not quasi-likeable. While not a fast read, it's quite literal and moves along as quickly as the locales of the story change. Again, Banks explores familial relationships and how they're affected by societal conditions. Perhaps the only thing keeping this book from getting five stars from me is the knowledge that Continental Drift and the Sweet Hereafter exist. Every time I read a Banks book, besides Cloudsplitter, I wonder why he isn't a more popular writer with the status quo. He's a great writer and this is a good book."
4,This book is Phat !!!!,I found this book to be very intresting. This is the first book I actually liked reading. It use some modern slang words the kids use today. I wound recomend it to anyone who enjoys reading a good book.
5,A book I'll never forget,"I'm fourteen years old, and my counselor at camp read us this book every night. Everyone in our cabin thought it was just awesome, and it is a summer i'll never forget. This book deals with subjects everyone ages 13-25 can relate to: sex, drugs, and finding out who you really are. The book has wonderful character dynamics, it was a pure pleasure to see Chappie going from a unhappy, drug infested, rebellious teenager to someone who finally figured out who he really is; and who he really wants to be. I thought the most interesting part in the book was when Chappie went to Jamaica with I-man, and discovered sex, drugs, reggae, and rastafarianism. This is truly a modern classic that every teenager should read, and a book i'll never forget"
2,teenage angst has paid off well,"Very repetitious writing, very didactic and simplistic storytelling. The stock ""abusive stepdad "" character, the passive ineffectual masochist mother cliche, and a witless reggae junkie yoda mentor all conspire to make a lame, feel-good, ""Ed Flanders"" type update of Catcher in the Rye. The book gets two stars though for having this great scene: the main character trashes a yuppie summerhouse only to bum a ride off the very same yuppies, who are vividly described with hilarious vulgarity, and as such this is the only memorable moment."
3,"Lots of fun, a tasty page turner","You wont learn the secrets of life out of this one,but it is a good, fun, book. Definitely worth reading. Dont be mislead by my 3 stars...I just like to leave a lot of room at the top. The Bone is entertaining and juicy. A very fun story line. When is the movie coming out? Give it a try."
3,Okay condition for paperback,Okay condition for paperback a little fraying on the edges and a sticker that left goo all over the front but everything else looks good.
4,Wow,Wow... this book is unbelievable. I really liked it. It was so easy to read. Written on a teenage level. It is bad. It is just hrd to belieave what this kid Chappie aka Bone does. His adolescent life is crazy and hectic. I dont know how anybody could survive that. it was really interesting and it made me feel really bad for Chappie. His life is so messed up. It is also interesting. This is one of these books that keeps you reading because you desperately want to see what happens next. It is amazing and everybody should read it
3,An out-of-ordinary piece of literature,"Rule of the Bone by Russell Banks was an invigorating novel. I commend Banks for being able to compose a narrative involving a youth addicted to drugs with an obsession for being a rebel. this was an adolecent who many of us pittied, but a small handful of us probably emulated him. I was incredibly interested in not only the main character (Bone), but I was dazzled by the creativity used by the author in portraying characters such as Froggy. He created a young girl who was sold to a man by the name of Buster Brown. I was blown away by the compassion that Bone showed to this helpless girl and also the liking that he took to I-Man."
4,It was a great book. I enjoyed it alot.,"""Rule of the Bone"" was a great book.I enjoyed it alot. It teaches a good lesson on life. How you should not abuse kids, because they are very fragile. It shows how kids can make dumb decisions in one second that can chage their life forever. Whether it is running away from home or getting involved in drugs or gangs.It was one of the best books I have ever read."
3,Not bad,"I read this book because it was assigned by my English instructor, it wasn't bad but just not something I would've read on my own."
1,"""Move along; there's nothing to see here.""","After ""Razor Blade Smile"" I was ready for more Eileen Daly, but ""Witchcraft X"" is about as bad as it gets. Redeeming qualities-none! From wooden acting & ridiculous dialogue to amateurish editing & extreme predictibility; it was an unwatchable nightmare. 1 star is way too much. Should you get it? Don't even think about it!"
3,Witchcraft 10 - believe it or not,"The story line has gone off the deep end with this installment! The ""hot"" detective returned from WC 9 - & joined forces with a white witch to fight against a satanist and a vampire who wanted to steal power away from a demon. If this were any further out there, it would have been a great comedy. Instead, it was just poorly acted comic relief. Since I'm working on getting the entire series, I'm hoping the next one(s) will be better. Please!!"
3,A Useful Tool for the Beginning Collector,"Shirely Dunn's guide to celluloid provides a useful history of the ""Celluloid Era"" of 1888 - 1920, including manufacturer's marks. She also includes color photos of a wide range of celluloid items, from clocks and toys, to manicure sets and advertising ware. Without an index, it is not very useful as a value guide.A good book for beginners, but not too terrific if you want to identify & value a specific piece."
5,A seventies masterpiece,"This brilliant but overlooked gem was Petula's first album after she left her old record labels - Warner in the USA and Pye in the UK. The set begins in brilliant fashion with The wedding song (There is love) which was later covered by Captain and Tennille.Petula included several covers on this album, all of which are superb, including Solitaire (the Neil Sedaka song more commonly associated with the Carpenters and Andy Williams, who both had hits with it), Don't hide your love (Neil Sedaka), Shelter (Joe South), Baby I'm yours (Barbara Lewis) and My guy (Mary Wells).Petula wrote one song herself - Song without end - and also included a song by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent, despite having split from them.While this is not one of the important albums of Petula's long and distinguished career, it is an excellent showcase for her talents and is a great addition to any collection of her music."
1,Broke IMMEDIATELY,Very attractive package but that's all. Ridiculously difficult to fill quickly (compared with dispensers such as Detach 'n Go). The capper was that the flimsy plastic lid covering one of the bins snapped off the very first time I tried to fill it. Useless. If it didn't cost more to ship the bloody thing than it's worth I'd return it.
1,Not what I hoped for,"The boxes were bigger than I expected, the whole thing doesn't have a cover so it is not portable for going away, each box is too big to put in the pocket to take for the day, and you can't see into them to know if they are filled or not. A big disappointment for my needs."
5,love this pill box!,"i take a lot of vitamins, minerals, etc twice a day, and this pill box holds them all with sections for AM and PM. This fits my needs exactly."
5,Excellent pill box,"I gave this item as a gift. I personally use the one with 4 compartments. This pill box is excellent when you have to take pills through out the day and do not want to carry around a BIG pill box and do not want to spend time every day filling up a pill box for the next day. This pill box is also very durable and does not open easily on your pocket, bag or purse (that have happened to me with other pill boxes and is a mess!!). It also helps with your self esteem because you do not see at once all the pills you have to consume in a week, as when you carry a big week-long pill box. I highly recomend this product."
4,More than expected,This works perfectly for all my vitamins. It got 4 stars because its cheap and the plastic lids came chips and cracked. I didn't care though because they didn't affect the lid closing. It was the lips of the lids that kept falling apart. Big enough for all my giant vitamins but I don't expect them to last for years.
4,Works for me,"Works well and is as advertised. Covers are little bit stiff, but I'm sure that's because it is new and they will ease up in time."
2,Difficult to open and very breakable,"I thought this would be perfect for organizing my vitamins. But, it is VERY difficult to open the compartments...and I found it scraped my knuckles in a mildly painful way every time I opened. One of the lids broke the first time I was filling them...and the clear tray was cracked when delivered. Save your money..."
1,If you want easy - don't buy these,"These cases are extremely difficult to open and shut. If you have a number of medications to set out ahead of time, you need something your fingers and hands have a simple time opening and closing.Trying to open these in the morning or evening without dumping the contents was a challenge and painful.I had to constantly pull at the tops to keep them open enough when I was filling them.Having them all in one spot, with pre labeled days and compartments sounded great, but these are bulky. Not easy to grab just the PM, and place in a pocket or purse.I set these up for a week-grumbled the entire time because I had to constantly pry them open trying to fill them-and used for exactly 1 day. TRASH! What I have used in the past and will keep using: ""Ezy Dose 7 Day Stackable Pill Reminder"". I buy 2 sets of these-1 for AM and 1 for PM. They are super easy to fill, handle, separate to take with, and do not take up much space."
1,Broke After First Time Opening,"I've had the smaller version of this pill holder for at least 4 or 5 years. It's been great and has lasted through lots of times opening and closing, putting in my pocket and purse, etc. I bought this version because I now take more meds and needed more room. The lid came right off after the first time I opened it on the ""Friday PM"" section. I love the idea of the compact storage and all, and have had great service with my first set, but I'm disappointed that this new version didn't even hold up to one opening of the lid. Take your chance if you buy this. Maybe I just got a defective set."
2,The white cottage mystery,"Never went past the first chapter,TOO predictable and not interesting. I think I could tell as soon as I started who would be friends with who, and how it would go. Not my type of book, I enjoy some mystery to it"
4,English Murder Mystery,"I really enjoyed this book. The investigator in the story reminds me of Poirot but with an English twist. The clues come slowly so you are guessing for a good ways into the story as to who did the murder. If you like a good mystery, this is a good read."
3,Pretty fair mystery.,"The ending was a disappointment. I felt that the novel had more stopped than finished. Author late for tea, perhaps?"
3,"Good, but not Great","The White Cottage Mystery is a crime/mystery novel that leaves you wanting more. More dialogue, more plots, and more character development. I had to read this book for a creative writing course and there was no urge to turn the page and continue as a wanting reader. Instead, I was forced to read it for class and didn't enjoy it very much. The reader is one step ahead of the detective and the ending is poor. I give it 2.5 stars out of 5. Quick read and you won't lose much time, but it is a little disappointing. It was ok, but not great."
2,No character development,"The bare bones of the mystery are sound enough, but the book is not fleshed out. It reads like a first plot draft."
2,The White Cottage Mystery,An updated version of a Marjorie Allenham mystery. Might have been better left alone. Some of the social aspects do not work well in the 21st century. Leave well enough as it was written. The original gives a history perspective of the mores of that time. Sheryl Jones
4,White Cottage,"This story totally reminds me of Poirot and Hastings and Sherlock and Watson. Jerry and his dad W.T. Challoner a police detective investigates the death of a blackmailer and evil man who took great pleasure in torturing the people he is blackmailing. This was a quick read, I just could not put it down. The book had a well developed plot and the characters were great.Thanks to Net Galley and Bloomsbury Publishing."
4,Trip back in time,This was a trip back in time. I always liked the Dobbies but had forgotten how much. Nice extended jams on some songs. Good song selection and being a drummer some nice playing.
3,Only for the Doobie lovers,"This is a great album for anyone who has not heard the Doobie Brothers before and wants to get to know the band. For anyone who has a lot of Doobie albums, this cd probably is not a good buy. The songs are simply recycled and there is no creative spin to make the cd unique. This cd is best for new fans or the Doobie obsessed."
1,Why Do They Do This?,"There's a reason it is only $5.98. They're rerecorded. Even Amazon disguises that they are rerecordings. The CD says so in white type in the lower left corner, but the Amazon repro of the label doesn't show it. Hmmmm... Don't waste time with this one, get the originals."
3,Ingredients,"To be able to write a review, it is helpful to havea list of ingredients this supplement contains.I have checked other manufacturers, like New Roots Herbal,and their products have a list of the ingredients contained,including the amounts."
5,"Brilliant and fascinating, tem que ler este livro!!!!!!","This is one of the most interesting books I've ever read. Stanton was a 19th century women's rights activist who had a complex, rationalist personal theology that changed and evolved thoughout her lifetime. This book reveals this theology, her weaknesses, and her. Recomendo este livro altamente!!!!!!"
5,What More Can I Say...,"I don't know what I can possibly add to the other reviews here, except to say that this is one of those albums that MUST be included in any blues (acoustic or otherwise) collection. Hurt's finger-picking style is unique and his lyrical approach is irresistible--you just have to hum along and tap those feet. Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!"
3,ok but not his best,"Not bad, but I prefer his recordings from the 1960's and '70's when his voice reflected what a sweet man he was."
4,CD,"Good fast service. Crack on front of case on arrival. Otherwise, the CD was in perfect condition."
4,In Dreams,"Excellent biography of Roy Orbison. Information about him is hard to come by, especially his personality. This DVD covers his life from youth on with interviews of those who knew him well. It gave me a much better understanding of someone who was evidently a nice man as well as a great singer."
3,Roy is great - editing...so so,"You have to be a REAL bad editor to kill this marvelous artist , but by golly...they've done that!no sensitivity whatsoever to cocert footage which is chopped like a bad ""mohell"" from hell. and just like a grown up average jewish kid...i didn't like it a bit.The voice over comes right before the musical picks instead of flowing before or after the songs , creating a horrible hybrid -no concert and no documentary.I'll probably rewrap it and stick it to the next sixtysomething surprise birthday boy.Surprise THIS!"
5,Just As Hoped For,"I have been searching for this album for many years, so finding it, then having it arrive in great condition so quickly was the icing on the cake. Thank you!"
4,Great for daily use,Love these for daily use. They are soft and feel good. I wish they woudl last longer. I have had mine for a few months now and its almost time to replace !
4,Reff Women's FlipFlops,"Nice looking flip flops, very strudy. Can tell they will last me a long time. A little stiff at first; really hurt my feet the first time I wore them for a long time. As I wear them in they are more comfortable."
5,Womens Reef Sandal,Great flip flops. Ive gotten several compliments. I have had them for a few weeks now abusing them. I just wash them off and they look like new. Would buy again.
3,Good deal but not a good fit,"These sandals fit right but the front is too big and doesn't look right. Other than the strap rubbing on the top of my foot, for the most part, they are pretty comfy."
3,"Love the shoe, but sizing is off","I received this shoe and love it. However, the sizing is off. I wear a 7 1/2 medium ladies size. So in sandals I have always wore a size 8. This size 8 is more like a size 7. I would return the item, but will cost more than I want to pay. So I will give these to my daughter-in-law who wears a size 7 so hopefully she can wear it. I think she will love the style. I am debating if I will buy a size 9 in a different color. Otherwise, it is a very nice sandal."
1,Wrong Size,"The website said size 6 Mens, the shoes were size 6 Womens, and the return process was designed so that i couldn't actually return them for shoes in the right size."
1,Latex?,"I'm very disappointed as this shoe must have some undisclosed latex in it. It was comfy true, but that does me little good!"
1,Quality,"I own a pair of reefs other than these. Bought both the Black & Brown. If you want a flip flop to bum around the house with, these are ok. But don't expect to get any sort of support if you plan to walk around for a long time they will hurt your feet. For the money not worth the brand name."
3,Oddly shaped,"Reefs are normally the only flip flops I'll wear, just because they are so much more comfortable than any other kind, but these particular shoes are a tripping hazard. The front of the shoe extends much farther in front of my toes than it should, and farther than it ever has on any other pair of Reefs I've owned. I was lured in by the blue polka dots, but these went back."
2,Seconds maybe??,I ordered these flip flops in blue and in black. The black pair fits well and are comfortable...The blue pair are the worst flip flops ever! They hurt my feet and feel too small...I'm not sure how the same shoe can have two different fits! I love reefs and have been wearing them year round for 15 years now but I am very disapointed in these.
3,Okay but not great,The inside thong strap rubbed the arch of my foot. So not a good fit for me. The Reef Slap 2 sandals were a much better fit for me.
3,Mmmm...just okay...,"I purchased the brown & pink flip flops and I hate to say it, but I'm really disappointed in them. I have a pair of Slaps that I absolutely LOVE and wore daily until my best friend's dog got ahold of them. I got these mostly based on the feedback and the cute pink straps. Well...the pink straps are already dirty and they don't come clean. They are comfortable, but they just aren't as substantial as the Slaps. I should have splurged and bought another pair of Slaps!"
4,Awesome.,"Great sandals! Very comfortable, soft material. Only problem I had was on an all-day walk around Disney- the straps were a little snug to the top of the foot. Other than that, I love them!"
4,cute everyday flip flop sandal,"I call this more of a cross between a flip flop and sandal, love a study solid color flip flop, everything was perfect but size was off. It wasn't so cute I would reorder."
2,Umm not comfortable..,"I'm size 7 and this feels like size 6.5. The front tho..seemed right length but the back seems a bit short, and the straps were too tight. Not sure if the straps would be comfortable even if it wasn't tight tho... The sole padding feels just ok but the material they use should be questioned... I dont think its comfortable on the skin at all. And its true the bottom can be slippery coz it's pretty much flat. I don't think it's worth the money. If it was $13 bux I would get an exchange for a bigger size.My questions is why the hell do these companies make sandals that are uncomfortable and charge us what it's to worth??? That is plain stupid. It is OBVIOUS they didnt use a shoe model... Thank god for amazon tho I can just get a refund hassle free."
3,They are OK,I bought these because I wanted something sturdier and more comfortable than the $3 flip flops I got at Old Navy. The arch is not as high as I thought it would be based on the pictures. The color is nice but they are no more comfortable than my $3 shoes. Oh well :)
3,Not as comfortable as my old reefs,"I had a pair of Reef sandals for about 5 or 6 years, wore almost every day in the warm months and they were do comfortable. I finally wore the soles out. I got these hoping they would be the same, they aren't as comfortable. I wore them to pick my kids up from school about a mile away and I had blisters on the bottom of my feet!"
2,Too Small and Not Very Comfy,"These sandals were ordered in a size 10, and they did not fit. I went into a store that sells them here and tried on a different style of reef sandals and they fit perfectly...I don't know why these didn't fit, but they were very uncomfortable because of that!! I gave them to someone else, who wears 9 1/2 and they fit her fine...I would recommend ordering a size up if possible..."
2,Lacking shock support,"Based on previous reviews, I purchased this and after wearing them for the whole summer I have to say I am a bit disappointed because they lack enough shock support for just general walking around & shopping. By the end of the day, your feet will hurt. I have a different pair of flip flops made by Crocs which I bought at a shoe warehouse that have the same thickness but with a much better shock absorption than the Reef sandals. Must have a different composition. As a bonus, the Crocs have tiny knobs on their sandals' foot bed which does make walking in them feel good to the skin, and at the end of the day in those, my feet don't hurt as much as if I'd spent the day in the Reefs."
3,Not as soft bottom as I would have liked.,"From reading some of the other reviews I thought the bottoms would be more cushioned than they are. They are just okay in my opinion, not bad, but not as comfortable as others I've owned."
3,Just okay for reef sandals.,"Kinda get what you pay for, they are cheaper but they also feel cheaper then most reef sandals. They're comfy compared to most flip flops but don't meet the reef standard comfort. I own the slap reef sandals and found they have a lot more cushion and support. Good for beaching etc. but not good if you are hard on your feet and do a lot of walkin like I do."
3,Cute but not comfortable,"Cute little pair of flip flops, but offer little to no support. I found them very uncomfortable and returned them."
4,ok but the black soles....,"I LOVE reef sandals and have owned a few pairs in the past. These are just like all of the reef sandals, comfortable, a good value, and good looking but they make the soles of my feet BLACK!!!!! I have to wash the bottom of my feet after wearing them. Not good when out in public and your feet look dirty."
5,Very confortable.,"I love to use Brazilian Havainas my n1 sandal, but this one is also niceand confortable."
5,"A Great Album, But You Can Get it for $9.90 instead of $50","If you don't want to pay $50 for a used, out-of-print copy, but still want the album, you can get it for $9.90 on iTunes."
2,"works ok, but...","Mine started to leak after about 2 weeks in use. just a small drip :-), but not where it should be. perhaps plastic is not sturdy enough..."
5,THE BEST POLARIZED I'VE EVER OWNED/WOMANS,"Firstly, I'm a woman and though most of these frames say ""unisex"" I would consider this a womens frame. I own the blond (Bromo Sedona) colored frame with rose lenses and tried all the colors on, and liked them all. These just go better with my skin and blond hair. This is the 2nd pair of Serengeti's I've owned. Up against the following for sport polarization and durability: Maui's, Oakley, Revo, Smith, they are FAR superior in frame and lens quality. I've owned all those brands. I boat, run, etc. and they are just very well made. On these the hinges don't seem to loosen over time, and they never seem to get those fine scratches on the lenses either, like with other brands. For sport: I'll never buy another brand again."
4,Shoes Series,Our son wanted the rest of this series and we received this in time for his Birthday and Christmas which was our intent. The delivery was on time and we appreciated your prompt service. Thanks R Tatton
2,least favorite by this author,Great book from a great series by a great author. She writes in a clear style that draws you in with intriguing story lines and appealing characters.
2,below average,I usually love anything by this author but this book was not good. The characters and story line were very disappointing.
1,Earrings for Child,Earrings are more suited for a child. Magnified to the extreme on screen. Earrings Direct (vendor) needs to make it more convienient for the buyer to make contact.
2,Wanted: Likeable Heroine,"While the writing is smooth and competent, the plotting and characterizations leave something to be desired. Laura Truitt, apparently intended to be spunky and forthright, comes across as thoughtless, rude and sometimes cruel, often acting like a child with no social graces. The hero, Stuart, is longsuffering and bland to the point of boredom. Laura's search for her daughter was the most compelling part of the book, yet that did not deliver the emotional punch that it should have. Many of the plot elements seemed contrived. That said, Ms. White has great promise and will hopefully attempt something in the future that is more original and borrows less heavily from those who have gone before (namely, Diana Gabaldon and Margaret Mitchell)."
2,Not so good.,"This book needs a good editor and a more polished author in the worst way! It is not believable, in that Civil War era ladies never swore and no civil war era hero would tolerate profanity of the sort spouted by this crude heroine. Nor are the heroine's interactions with her long lost daughter believable! The writer certainly shows promise, but she has a long way to go. Entire passages of this novel just make the reader wince. I can't believe that the other reader reviews are so enthusiastic. I read an average of one romance novel a day, and this book is NOT a five star effort."
4,Great TV for the price,"This tv is a great value with good picture and good sound for internal speakers. The tv itself is rather large and heavy but if you have the room it is a great set. The delivery service was also a great value, as they were on time, and fast with the set up. I would recomend this tv to anyone looking for a large screen, good picture quality, and good sound at a reasonable price."
4,"Nice TV, not-so-great delivery","The TV indeed has great sound that more than fills up the room. The picture quality and sharpness are excellent. In close-ups, shadows on people's faces can appear slightly purplish- or greenish-grey, but maybe the color can be adjusted to correct this. Delivery was right on time but it was a nightmare because the one Eagle delivery guy could not possibly uncrate and install the 150-lb. beast all by himself. He was a very nice, very conscientous guy who truly gave it his best effort. The TV is cumbersome to say the least and so front-heavy it literally fell out of the entertainment center once. I'm hoping that's not the cause of the color problems because Amazon doesn't accept returns of TVs over 27""."
1,Tube whines,"The TV tube buzzed so loud, turning up the volumed only gave me a headache. Factory service couldn't replace the tube so I waited a few months for the factory to send me a new one. The tube on the new one buzzes too. But after it warms up, it settles down to a volume I can handle. I don't want to deal with factory service anymore."
1,This is pitiful,I never write in reviews but this is the worst cookbook I've ever bought. We probably have 40 or 50.There are only 101 recipes and 7 of them are for either rabbit or venison. I don't know anyone who cooks either. The index in the back is listed in page order. I'm not making this up. Usually you turn to the back and look up beef or chicken or whatever and it shows you the recipes for that ingredient. When you look at the index here it gives the name of the recipe on the first page and then the 2nd page.Don't buy this! I'd give it a zero if I could.
2,...one BIG step down,"This recording was never released until the '90s and dates back over a decade. In the liner notes, Jules Shear describes the CD as the best of their music. The liner notes also imply poor sales stopped this one from being initially released ... my guess is someone at Columbia simply thought it sucked. Even for a J & PB fan, this is a disappointing legacy.Their first two records (out of print) were so refreshing. This CD feels much more like a major change - for the worst - in musical direction. Not nearly as fresh or lyrically interesting as the first 2 Jules & the Polar Bears records. Nothing catchy, nothing crazy, this one isn't worth a $5 gamble in the cut out bin."
5,Simpy Amazing,"This album is an unparalleled collection of electronic improvisation, mixed with elements of noise and free jazz. The arrangements are done with expert artistry and it is rather startling how emtional intense these pieces are. A true classic."
1,Canceled,"Unfortunately, this product has been canceled by Vince McMahon, due to his unwillingness to have anything to do with Randy Savage. Hopefully McMahon will change his mind soon. Sure, Savage is kind of a nut, but he does have a legacy in wrestling that should be honored someday."
4,Interesting Book,"The format of this book is fascinating: a series of letters the author never wrote but wishes she had. As the child of missionaries, the author faces unique situations. It is interesting to read about those parts of her childhood that were so different from what one thinks of as ""normal"". For instance, her stories of being sent away to boarding school as a small child are heart wrenching. Yet, there are also many parts of the book that explore universal feelings, doubts, and questions. This is definitely a book that will break your heart and lift your spirit at the same time."
3,Standard Martial Arts Primer - But Recommended,"This book authored by lesser known, but legends nonetheless, Steve Sanders (now Steve Muhammed) and Donnie Wlliams and compiled by Nigel Binns gives a brief introduction into the BKF (Black Karate Federation) and Kenpo karate. One of the reason for the brevity is the book was written in 1983 and the BKF was still a relatively recent organization (as most American organizations were, after all, they were longstanding if they had been around only 15-20 years at that time).They quickly go into exercises, 12 basic moves, and the 27 nerves. The photos are clear and easy to follow. Their advice, though seldom given, is good advice for the novice. The best thing about this book is having something in print by two American martial arts pioneers."
3,Good ... if you like allegory,"I've read most of C.S. Lewis's non-fiction books and I found this one the least insightful. I'm glad he moved away from allegory for his later works. This story seems to deal with Lewis's own journey of discovery and all the possible philosophies he encountered and discounted along the way before settling on Christianity.The problem I had with the allegorical treatment in this story is that it doesn't really share with the reader the same depth of reasoning that he is capable of. He demonstrates that wonderfully in the simple but erudite personal conversational style in (for example) Mere Christianity or The Four Loves. The choice of allegory in this feels like a barrier. If you leave the allegory aside (which might miss the whole point of the book) and read it just as a heroic fable in its own right, the Pilgrim's Regress has better competition out there in that genre.You'd really need to love allegory to love this book I think."
3,"Not Lewis' best work, but well worth reading for Lewis fans","This is an interesting allegory along the lines of Bunyan's ""Pilgrim's Progress"" which seems to depict Lewis' own spiritual and philosophical journey. Average readers (like me) may not pick up on some of the symbolism here, but there is enough of interest for Lewis fans (like me) to make it well worth reading (in spite of the bad poetry). Don't skip the preface (to the 3rd edition) as it provides some good insight to the story and an important explanation of Lewis' concept of ""romanticism"" and what he means by ""joy"" in the sense of ""longing"" or ""desire"" which cannot be entirely satisfied in this life. I think my favorite part was John's conversation with Reason in the chapter ""Esse is Percipi"" where we are reminded that the real world of our being hasn't all that much to do with our material existence, the physical makeup of our bodies."
4,The book is a great Sequel to Pilgrim's Progress,"From start to finish the characters explore the depth of himanity, in a sureal way. Displaying reality in a case of fiction. It is a great read, take it slow."
5,"Slightly Dated, but Still Very Relevant","I both enjoyed and unenjoyed this book. It's a bit hard to explain why, though. I enjoyed it because it was an interesting tale and lightly told. Many of the points are not difficult to graps, even when guised as allegory. But at times, some of the allegorical characters really got rambling on and on and this made it difficult to wade through for what, exactly, was being allegorized. But, as Lewis himself admits, it was a bit dense at times and therefore he added bylines at the tops of each page to help readers who get bogged down in the quagmire. So, I suppose, on the whole it was good, and I would recommend it to other Christians, but I have my suspicions that non-Christians won't quite see it the same way."
3,"Wonderful, but not Lewis's best","This is an allegory to the road Lewis traveled in becoming a Christian. The traveler on the road encounters many different views represented as characters, like Ms. Enlightenment or Reason. In the end John comes to a huge canyon and must take a dive - a leap of faith - which is representative of a person's repentance. The journey back is very different than the journey that he took, obviously representing the different life of a Christian."
1,broken binding,"I know the cost was very low, but as soon as I opened the package the entire cover dropped off the book. bad bad shape. This kind of information should have been shared before I bought it."
1,looks can be deceiving,"the book looked to be in great condition but when I started to read it I was confused. The first several chapters didn't seem to be the story I thought this book was - but I kept reading, thinking it was a preface. Then all of a sudden Chapter 13 was different font with pictures - of the book I thought I was getting! So I got half of one book and half of another! The book looked from the outside to be the book I wanted and in perfect condition but on the inside it was parts of two different books."
5,Wonderful!,We love this CD. We have never been disappointed with anything from David Baroni. Beautiful original piano music that is so peaceful and pleasant to listen to.
4,needs a second edition,"This book gives you a good idea of both the political and economic events of the 90s in the three countries. However, the book was probably written in 2000-01 and leaves the reader wanting to know about the interesting times since then. The author should consider updating it in a second edition."
5,Modern Jazz Comes of Age,"Courtney Pine has reinvented himself yet again with an outstanding synthesis of modern jazz and hip hop. With Cyrus Chestnut at the keyboards, he explores new music landscapes that are innovative and expressive but never overdone or predictable. This album gets my choice for best modern jazz album for the past few years."
4,The singer we need!,"Petula's hit ""Downtown"" was a decade old when she recorded this period set. Contained within are pop, country and a touch of disco. The end result is one of the more satisfying albums of her 70s career. The towering arrangements are matched by Pet's unwavering vocal determination. From the lovely cover of Kristofferson/Coolidge's ""Loving Arms"" to the international Mocedades hit ""Eres tu"", Pet proved once more her talent to be timeless. To top off this enjoyable set is her fierce vocals on ""Never Been a Horse""-a disco tour de force."
1,I paid too much,"Ordered a car cover for my husband and thought ""oh yeah I guess he will need this too"", but I wasn't paying attention and the shipping was like $7 bucks...I could've paid the neighbor kid $3 to cycle over to the hardware store if I were feeling too lazy to go myself and I'm willing to bet I could find a set of equal quality at the dollar store."
2,One of the worst BSB books out,"I've have seen waaaaay better books than this one! Please! The information is repetitive, the pictures aren't in color, and the book is fairly boring. If you are deciding which book you should get don't choose this one!"
4,BSB: They've got it goin' on!!!!!,"This book is the most enlightening book with the most interesting facts about the hottest boy band in the States : the Backstreet Boys! This book tells what the Boys look for in a girl, what they like, and all kinds of personal information. I suggest that anyone who is a fan of the Backstreet Boys buy this book. Even if you are not a fan of the Backstreet Boys, it is a great book that grabs your interest immediately. Great job guys! Keep up the good work!"
2,A Selective Review,"Really Swell ChristmasI purchased this product because it includes ""Santa and the Doodle-li-boop"" by Art Carney, a record I had as a kid. It's fun; it consists of Carney's vocals backed only by drums. Carney is having fun. At one point he seems on the verge of breaking out in laughter. Kids might like it, little ones, especially if there names is Tommy. The rest of the collection is bland and harmless. I wish I could say it was so bad it was good, but the singers and musicians are better than that. If you're looking for something to put on the box to nod off to mid-Christmas day, this might work."
4,Surprise....Rosemary's a rocker!,"I know of Rosemary Butler from her always-excellent work as a background vocalist for James Taylor and Jackson Browne.Given that, I expected this disc to be a little more acoustic-folky. It's not, and that's not a bad thing. All but two songs are up-tempo pop-rock numbers, which I would compare favorably with Pat Benatar's 80s catalog or perhaps Quarterflash. The ballads are where she really gets a chance to shine. She's a gifted singer, and it sounds like she's really having fun. The only reason I couldn't give this disc 5 stars is because the vocals are often buried in the mix on the up-tempo numbers, drowned out by the rhythm track. Her voice is much clearer on the two ballads. This is no reflection on Ms. Butler, but just shoddy mixing.A solid effort overall, and well worth the price of admission."
5,More movies by Lucian Pintile,This movie is amazing. Lucian Pintile is a genuis. You need to sell more movies made by Lucian Pintile.
3,Three and a half stars,It's an interesting documentary; it is not a how to video. But if you're interested in hearing from old time Farrier this pretty good. Except for the times when his phone began to ring when he is trying to explain something. The cameraman should you done a little more editing.
2,Unmasked flat,Although this story has a lot of action and a love story it just left me totally uninterested. The storyline is interesting but the main characters just didn't interest me. I almost stopped reading the story half way through. Nothing grabbed about the characters. They were 2-dimensional and I really didn't care if they succeeded or not.
2,very wet snorkel,"no valves or purge valve so you have to be ready to clear it the old fashioned way--i found it better to use my old rigid snorkel stored under a wing of my bcd. that way, if i actually decided to use it, i would have a pleasant time swimming"
2,Hollow Movie + Parents Beware.,"It's very hard to reccomend this movie and here's why:VERY SMALL AGE BRACKET: The movie is so childish, that is will turn off adults. Most family films have themes that adults can enjoy, but this doesn't. Yet this movie contains some mild to moderate VIOLENCE, WHICH MAKES THE APPROPRIATE AGE ABOUT 7-10 YEARS OLD.THERE IS NO REAL STORY OR CHARACTERS: The characters have too much dialogue that doesn't really show their personality. They are hard to relate to (not because they're dinosaurs, but because they're shallow). The wonderful special and visual effects only satisfy for the first 15 minutes.So, as I said, the mild violence mixed with the hollow and childish story make this movie hard to reccomend to almost anyone."
4,It's a Good Children's Movie,"Don't let negative reviews put you off. I have four children, and the three who are above the age of two loved this movie. They didn't cry or scream. The graphic are breathtaking. The story isn't really anything terribly original, but then, what Disney story is? They all have basically the same theme and this film is no more violent than The Lion King (probably Disney's best modern effort"", the violence is simple done with computer graphics instead of traditional animation."
1,Standard Edition DVD Won't Play,"I had read of problems with the Collector Edition not playing on some DVD players, but the standard edition won't play on my Toshiba SD-2109. This is the only DVD that I haven't been able to play on this player. It can't get past the loading function. Disney is quickly earning a reputation for shoddy quality control, between Dinosaur and the faulty surround sountrack mastering on the standard edition of Tarzan (the left front channel sound was recorded on the left rear channel as well as the left front channel)."
2,I wanted to like it. . .,The animation was beautiful. The critters blended in with the real backgrounds and looked like they belonged. I'm sure that Walt Disney would be proud of the new computer animation studio that was built for making this film and future releases. But I thought that the characters and story were lacking.
4,So cute,"I bought this movie for my 3 year old granddaughter, who watches it again and again and never tires she loves it. Great movie to educate kids"
1,"Great, if only it will play...","A good fun, entertainment movie, though it could be too intense for kids under 10 yrs. My 3 yr old son loved it at the movies! 5 stars for content. Minus 4 stars because the ""Film Facts Fossil Dig"" (making of) feature on the 2-Disc Collector's Edition stalls the movie both on my PowerDVD software player and my standalone player. I've yet to play the DVD without interruptions!"
2,DINOSAUR COLLECTOR'S EDITION IS A RIP OFF...,"The movie is fine, but the 2-disc Collector's Set is a scam. The second disc is garbage and not worth the extra money. The second disc is difficult to navigate and is loaded with useless garbage. Where are the featurettes? If you like the movie, just buy the regular single disc version and avoid the 2-disc rip-off."
5,Great DVD,This is a great movie for kids. Our kids range in age from toddler to 11-years old and this is one of the few movies that they all enjoy. The DVD arrived quickly and was in great shape.
3,Dinosaur Recall,"I bought the deluxe edition because I have seen this film in the theaters and I loved it. I tried to play it on two DVD players and on one it didn't play at all, and on the other it would jump scenes. I did play it on my computer and it played fine, but it's not the same as on my bigger screen in the living room where I have my DTS and so forth. I called The Disney Store about this and they said that they are having a lot of complaints from consumers who cannot view the DVD. They also said that Disney DVD will be reissuing another Dinosaur DVD to replace this one, and that they will issue credit for your faulty one. On the other hand, disc 2 plays great and has a lot of cool features, but most of the features are on disc 1, one being the movie itself."
2,Dino-sad,"When I think Disney, I think about leaving the real world for 90 minutes. A departure from the grind of daily life. That includes comedy and light-hearted Disney animation. Ever seen Toy Story? Ok, Dinosaur is 90 minutes of dino-despair. Every turn brings more death and depression. Yeah, there's a happy ending, but did I even want to get there?Of course, the animation and scenes were very beautiful - but this was a departure from what people know of Disney. I was disappointed with this one."
1,How can you see a movie that won't play?,"My son and I have tried 3 different copies of this DVD on two differrent DVD players. It won't even boot up on mine, which is a year old. On my son's DVD player, the first two copies booted, then froze up later during play. The third copy wouldn't boot at all. This is absolutely outrageous that Disney would put something like this out. No more Disney movies on DVD for me AT ANY TIME."
3,No New Features,This copy of Dinosaur is just a reprint of the 2007 Blu Ray and 2001 DVD. Same features as before. If you like the movie get it. If you wanted to see brand new bonus material. You may be disappointed.
5,You'll love it no matter how old you are!,"Disney has made a great film that the whole family will love! The computer animation is worth seeing if your an adult, but you probably wouldn't enjoy the story. But little kids adore it! It's about a dinosaur named Aladar who's egg was stolen when he was a baby. It was taken to an island inhabited by Lemers. The lemers raised him and treated him as one of the family. But when a huge meteor comes crashing down destroying their home, Aladar and his family are forced to join the heard of Dinosaurs trying to reach the nesting ground. The leader of the heard and Aladar are as unalike as they come. The leader believes in survival of the fitist, so he is ready to leave behind some old and slow dinosaurs. Aladr dosn't think that way, so he leads the weak Dinosaurs to a short cut. But The Carnatours are closeley on the trail of the heard, and when Aladar finds out the herd went the wrong way, he has to save them. Kid's love to watch it over and over so buy it today!"
5,What a great movie!,Awesome movie! My son and I loved it! Very good story and well made! Good for all ages! Highly recommended!
1,I could not get this to play on my computer.,"While it might be an easy view for someone else, it was not for me. I purchased it with no problem and it seemed that it was going to play, but never did."
2,Dino lover,"Animation is brilliant - but oh what ever happened to a good story line? Not only was there Monkeys living at the same time of Dinosaurs (when in reality the biggest mammal was the size of a mouse), but they also talked!And the terrible ""lets get together and we can sort this problem out"" constant behaviour made me sick.2/5 for pure animation 0/5 for the worst story line yet ever put on the big screen."
4,Good but predictible,"We bought this because our 2 1/2 year old son loves dinosaurs. While this movie has great special effects, lots of action, and a nice story I was confused about the addition of the lemurs who did not exsist at that time. Now I have to explain to my son everytime we watch this that monkeys were not around when the dinosaurs were. The rest is classic Disney and if you can get past the ""lemur thing"" your family will definatly enjoy this film. However this is not for the sqimish or for children who are easily frightened."
1,don't buy this DVD buy VHS,I love DVD but Disney came out with a DVD that you can't play unless you get your DVD player up graded. This involves sending in your player to be upgraded.
1,Not again! For little babies only..,"Another dinosaur movie? Another talking dinosaur movie? C'mon, enough already with the talking dinosaurs. Have your kids watch the dinosaur on the Discovery channel, at least they won't rot their brains watching this boring, brainless movie."
2,deja vu,"I've seen this movie before, only it used to be called ""The Land Before Time."" Disney should be sued by the writers of ""The Land Before Time"" for their blatant plagiarism of the plot. One big difference though is that Disney should have spent some time developing characters the audience would care about. My recommendation is to buy the ""Tarzan"" video which has a preview of the only good part of ""Dinosaur"", as it shows the first five minutes of the movie. That way, you'll not only get ""Tarzan"", which is a better movie, but also the only watchable part of ""Dinosaur""."
1,Too many problems...,"I honestly expected better from Disney. We've purchased a number of Disney titles over the past year, Bugs Life CE, Toy Story 1 & 2 CE, Fantasa CE, and others as well. So, when it came to buying Dinosaur, I wouldn't have thought that there was a reason to be concerned.I was so wrong.So far, I've had two copies... I don't think I'll take a third. It is very jerky, and at times, even skips the chapter completely. My player isn't exactly new, but then again, it's not old either... we just got it a year ago.If Disney expects everyone to upgrade to the latest DVD players just to watch their movies, they can keep their movies.As much as I like Disney movies, this makes me question if I'll ever buy another one again. I don't want my money back, I want the product that I was intending to buy and I want it to play in my DVD player. Isn't that reasonable? Must not be for Disney."
4,"Great Movie, but...","If you plan on using this CD solely on a DVD-ROM I wouldnt recommend getting this colectors edition. The movie stopped playing :01 (minute) into it using Power DVD. It also did this at various points during the movie, in other chapters too. I went and used it on my stand-alone player and it worked fine. The movie is great, but a little short, the visuals and sounds are amazing, not to mention a great score that can be heard in most of the movie."
4,"Amazing Animations, Good Film Overall","I was first captivated by 'Dinosaur' in theaters and the DVD is just as captivating. Some of my friends said the movie was 'junk', but you do have to realize that this movie is a children's story and the plotline has to essentially be simple. 'Dinosaur' is touching and it's pure eye candy. I don't know if the DVD is worth buying, but you must at least rent this to check out all the dazzling embelishments it has offer!"
4,Great for the dinasour lover in the family,Kept me on the edge of my seat while watching with my daughter. She loves to watch it!
4,Another Milestone In Animation,"This was yet another example, when it came out in 2000, of the latest strides being made in animation, computer-or-otherwise. At the time, I thought to myself, ""Man, this just gets better and better all the time."" Nine years later, I am still saying that but with newer animated efforts. They've become awesome, especially on Blu-Ray.Some of the scenes in here look so real you wouldn't know they were drawings. The colors are particularly good in the opening minutes. They are just stunning at times. I hope it gets the Blu-Ray treatment some day.The story is pretty interesting, too. It's not great, but not boring, either, and not too kid-oriented. Adults can enjoy this. In fact, I was surprised at the amount of violence. That, and some of the jokes actually make this more for adults than kids in many spots."
5,Dinosaurs,"An excellent choice for ""kids from one to ninety-three."" Disney came out with its usual excellent film. Some of the scenes were somewhat intense for small children, and Disney departed from its once standard of never showing death. However, for the elementary and even junior high school audience, the film is worth the price. I have not had time to view the extras (if any) on the DVD, but my fifteen year old seemed to enjoy them."
1,Six year old suss' this movie out,"I haven't even seen the movie, however my 6 and 4 year old went to see it with relatives. When I asked them what it was like the six year old said "" I've seen it before"". When I asked what he meant, he said "" It's the same as Land before Time"" .If a six year old can suss this out, perhaps Disney might want to think about putting more original storyline into movies and not concentrate quite so much on the CGI."
4,Memories,"Watching this was so much fun. I remember seeing it when I was young and couldn't resist buying it now,"
3,Movie skips bad at first,The first part of movie skips horribly. Once past that it works fine. I plan to take to movie rental shop to see if they can help with the skipping.
5,Fantastic!,"My wife and I loved this movie!It is like watching a movie-length version of only the best scenes from Jurassic Park. What softens the dramatic blow is the heavy action with very little (if any) blood, the dinosaurs talk, and two of them even fall in love. We watched ''Dinosaur'' several times, each time enjoying it more than the last.My four-year old son, however, has another opinion. At this point in his development, realistic dinosaurs (even ones who speak) aren't his cup of tea. He gets a little scared. But given time, I am sure he will come around.Just by listening closely to the superb sound and watching the stunning graphics, you will be able to tell that ''Dinosaur'' is more than just another dino-flick, but a labor of love.This would make a wonderful addition to anyone's video collection."
1,Disc Does Not Play!,I have now tried two new copies in my DVD player. Both skip around at the same exact places. Hmmm.....Really disappointed in this one. Disney needs to come clean on this one and offer a refund or a rebate. There are lots of folks who are going to wonder about Disney DVD purchases in the future. I know I will.
1,Dinosaur DVD - Defective?????,"I gave this DVD a 1 because I could not get my DVD player to play the disk. I took it back to the store and got another one and my DVD player (JVC 2000BK) still would not play the DVD. I have over 165 DVD's and all play correctly. AT the store I met another individual that was returning his Dinosaur DVD because it would not play (A JVC player too). I have read various DVD forums and there appears to be a problem with this DVD. So to keep the grand kids happy, we had to settle on the VHS version."
4,"Superb, lifelike animation, conventional plot.","The story line is run-of-the-mill, OK I guess considering it's for kids. The animation steals the show, the dinosaurs seem real, and the landscapes are gorgeous, you're just carried back into another world. My 4 year old nephew loves this movie, even with some parts that I thought might be too scary, like the carnotaurs, and the terrifically done meteor impact."
1,DO NOT BUY of this poorly made DVD.,"I am one of what seems many people who are unable to watch this video. After several attempts to rent the standard edition and then buying the collector's edition, I still have not seen this video. I own a 2 year old JVC DVD player. This won't even load into my player. The drawer slides in and it can't read it. It is only through these reviews that I was able to learn I wasn't crazy.Disney merchandising played dumb when I called them(saying they were not aware of any problem), and because it was not bought at a Disney store, they couldn't do anything to help me. I am hoping I can get a refund on the DVD, but it is extremely difficult to get anything but another copy of the DVD out of a merchant for an open DVD.Let's find an email or snail mail address for Disney and write them about how dissatisfied we are about paying $30 for a worthless piece of plastic.I wanted to put 0 stars, but that isn't an option!"
