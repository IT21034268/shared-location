1,Rod cst/berger 06-808A,"I dont satisfied with the product. I order the rod Cst/berger 06-808A model, measures in feet and tenths, dual sided graduate, but I received the cst/berger 06-808C, mesuares in feet and one side graduate only . I dont satisfied."
3,Two Fair Games,"This product includes two games on a single CD: Equestriad and Riding Star.Equestriad allows you to ride as a real-life horse an rider team in three events: dressage, show jumping and cross country. The graphics are fair, considering the game was made in 2003. The events are very realistic (view is just behind the horse) and the announcers are accurate. This game would be challenging to younger players, but provides quite a bit of replayability, as you can choose riders/horses from all over the world and there are several levels per event.Riding Star focuses on caring for and competing with one horse (Star), which means that a lot of time is spent at the stable for grooming and feeding. The events are fun and have a top-down view. There is also a multi-player option, where four people can race against each others' times on eight different horses. An alright game, but it can get repetitive and after the championship is won, there is little else to do.Both games work fine on Vista."
5,works for me,"I recieved the Certification, looks like Amazon won't let me tell you how much the total cost was but it was not out of line with the other online certifications I have found. The test is a no brainer, the pamphlet gives all the answers word for word."
1,sorryrat again,"You are out of your mind if you pay this new price for this pamphlet. I wrote a review under the name sorryrat a few years ago when the price was reasonable My password does not work anymore for that name but you can reach me at sorryrat@aol.com if there are any questions. I retract any comments I ever made about this pamphlet, and strongly suggest you look around, and ask your local supply houses, you can most likely find what you need for free. This is a ludicrous price!"
2,what you see is what you get,"I recieved this book today and it appears to be sufficient to get the certification. It is a 12 page pamphlet from Vatterott College with an answer form and an envelope to mail in the answers to Vatterott, along with [required amount of money]. It looks like something you could pick up for free at a supply house,.... Look around some before you order this, save [your money], like I should have. I will let you know if it works."
1,Not worth it,"I thought it looked like a good garlic press but in reality it is cheap plastic and doesn't have the crushing power to do more than 1 small piece at a time. Then you have to take the entire thing apart and scrape off the inside drum, way too much work."
1,So Sad,"I came on Amazon to look for something to help cut garlic. I found this product with great reviews and the price was perfect. I ordered it and was extremely excited to receive my new garlic appliance.I opened it last night to try it out and it was awful. The directions are completely clear and the gadget doesn't do what it says it's going to do.The first piece of garlic I put in there I had already peeled and when it came out of the machine it was complete mush. Like someone took at mallet to it and pounded it. My husband suggested I did it wrong since it was pre-peeled. So we tried again this time with the peel on. The garlic turned out the same way, all mush.I honestly don't know if we were to blame for using the machine incorrectly but the directions aren't very clear since they are printed on the outside of the box. I was too disappointed by the gadget to even deal with figuring out if I did something wrong.Amazon had been great helping me get the item returned."
2,Needs Description,"I think on the product description it should specify if the cologne is spray or splash, because I have ordered and gotten the wrong thing."
4,A good start,I just got a slow cooker for Xmas the recipes are easy to follow and so far tasty. A good introduction to my new way of cooking hearty meals in my busy life.
5,Love it!,My fiance and I have this cook book and we especially love the chili and the pot roast recipes. We have also gotten this as a gift and recommended recipes to our family members. It is very easy to follow and actually has food that you will eat!
3,"It gives options for 6qt , 3 1/2 qt and 1 qt crock pots",I am buying this for my 84 year old father because I realized that it has recipes for 1 qt crock pots. I will include this cook book with a 1 qt crock pot for his Christmas gift. The 1 qt crock pot cooks meals from 1-3 persons. Perfect for a man who now lives alone.
1,Disappointed,"I love Tish. I bought this CD at her concert in Westport, CT last week and I am very disappointed with it. Count me among those who don't like the pop sound she creates here. The CD contains a number of songs that she performed in concert--they were beautiful live, but not on the CD. Drums, bass guitar. Who needs it? Certainly not Tish. And aside from that, for some reason her voice doesn't come through with the same clarity and beauty as on her other CDs, and as it does in concert. Experimentation is fine, but to me, this CD's a failure. (But I still love you, Tish.)"
5,A wonderful album from a group on the way up!,"I love this album. Every song. These guys just keep getting better and better.The song writing talents of Darren Schlappich are improving with age. Thisgroup from Reading, Pa. started out doing mostly bluegrass and now aredoing a broader range of styles--all done well. I look forward to seeing theseguys live someday. Check out frogholler.com to find out more."
4,Excellent Introduction to Recent Chinese Hstory,"John Fraser's book is an easily accesibly, non-scholarly overview of the terrible events that occurred during China's arguably darkest period in it's 3,000 years of history. He avoids the objective by-stander point of view and is able to draw the reader to the story and the Chinese people. Simply must-read for anyone interested in understanding China."
3,Not too bad,"After hearing ""Here I Come"" on the GTA: San Andreas soundtrack, I had to see what this guy really sounded like. I can't say I'm a big fan of the other guy on this album who seems to appear in most songs, but there's a couple really good songs on here that I never skip on my iPod, like ""Girl I Like Your Style"" and ""Under Mi Sensei"". Not a bad purchase overall."
4,Useful companion,"If you have any interest in the classic Role Playing Game SPACE 1889, the Soldier's Companion is as full of useful background information as a high quality sausage is full of meat."
5,The Path To 9/11,"This docudrams for the first time depicts accurately the war on terrorism. It illustrates the ineptness of the Clinton administration. It illustrates the the fact that the Clinton administrastion response to numerous attacks was to treat them as a law enforcement issue rather than the realization that these attacks were an act of war by a very determined enemy, the terrorists i.e. Osama bin Laden.This docudrama should be viewed by all Americans."
5,Well done docudrama,"The Clintons tried mightily to squelch the original broadcast and it looks like they're working their magic on the DVD. It's a shame because it was a very good movie and with seven Emmy nominations, certainly should be made into a DVD."
5,On TV in 2006 only.,"I really enjoyed this on television in 2006, but alas, it has been blocked by the Clintons. It will never make it mass production! Our loss...Hope you taped it when it was broadcast!"
5,The Movie that Tells the Truth,The Movie that finally tells the truth about 911. Not allowing to be sold it on DVD is a form of censorship. The Clintons and their cronies want to block the distribution of this film. Where is the free speech? Where is the 1st Amendment?
1,Idiotic right-wingnut propaganda,"Some scenes were fabricated that show Clinton cabinet members in a bad light, while actual events that would have shown how clueless Bush and his cabinet were got short shrift or weren't portrayed at all. For example, it didn't show Bush receiving the PDB warning that Bin Laden was planning to strike in the US. Neither did it show Bush sitting in that classroom for 10 minutes after being told that the country was under attack."
2,"""Brought to you by...""","...this propaganda piece, ""The Path to 9/11"" was funded by a partnership between a Christian evangelical group called ""Youth With a Mission"" or YWAM and a hitherto secret right-wing Hollywood group led by David Horowitz and most likely funded by Richard Mellon Scaife of Whitewater fame.I saw most of it when it aired on television, but I just could not sit through such heavy-handed partisanship (no I'm not a Democrat) although the production was first-rate though corny in certain scenes. That said, I just can't help coming back to the fact that the attacks happened under GWB's watch. Period.Can you imagine any CEO blaming his predecessor for a company's failure? Why don't we just blame our upcoming recession on Herbert Hoover?"
5,Destined To Be Hidden,"I appreciated this program and would buy it in a minute, but I am afraid the Clintons will never allow it to come out on DVD.I would like to see the unedited (pre Clinton strong-arming) version."
5,FREE SPEECH NOW! Release this Movie Now!,The Film Makers want this movie released - But Disney is choosing to not distribute it because of political pressure. This is Fascism and Un-American!
5,Got it on DVD great movie,"when I heard Disney was gonna bury this movie forever just like they have done my Song of the South movie, I searched the net high and low and did come up with the broadcast version of this 2 part miniseries on DVD, quality on my 52in brava is very good for a standard DVD, hi def would have been great, this was about 18 months ago I got this. Now you cant find this anywhere on the net. Now some places are selling bootleg unedited version of this for $20, which I do believe is quite illegal. Now if they provided the copies free that is legal since this has only been broadcast over the air and those by the way are legal to have and free to pass along. As of today when one of the investors begged Disney to either release this on DVD/Blu Ray or sell the rights to any of the other many waiting studios begging for this, the CEO for Disney actually told the Investor to go F!!!! himself, yeah nice family friendly disney studio."
3,One Epic Story Plus Filler,"The back-drop for the three short stories involve aliens studying galactic history in a university, and I couldn't really connect well with Tiptree's xenobiological environment. A solid 'meh', but it served for introduction.The first story ""The Only Neat Thing To Do"" is amazing. It follows the perspective of a young fifteen year old space-crazy rich girl who ends up saving her Federation from a Brain-Plague type alien threat. It is emotional moving. Five stars.The second story deals with cold sleep, freedom, and pirates. It relies too heavily on technical science for plot movement, and I could not picture the climax well because it depended upon advanced technological quirks, and I'm not even sure the science holds up. Three stars.The third story deals with aliens and war and first contact. It has too many 'just so' coincidences, and I didn't enjoy it that much. Two and a half stars.Overall, I highly recommend the first short story. The rest of the book can be ignored."
2,Questionable,The glasses are fun and pretty but the shaker itself is worthless there is a plastic top piece that goes on it one problem though one you get the plastic top on you won't get it off! I am throwing this shaker away and ordered a good stainless steel one. At least the glasses are ok!
5,Newtonian Demonstrator,Great birthday present for our 13 yr. old son. Product is sturdy and well made. Quick ship by SELLER.
5,camper special,use my truck to pull our 5th wheel and have had these lights for years broke my last covers a year ago then found these on amazon best price around fast shipment
1,Disintegrated in less than a year,"I bought a set of Hella 500 driving lights and they came with these covers. As others said, basically being exposed to elements turns the covers into pretty much plastic dust. They start to get brittle, crack and ultimately fall apart.I just can't believe the plastic is so bad on these. Save your money and protect your lights with something else. My car always gets garaged and rarely stays parked under sunlight for more than a few hours and these things lasted less than a year."
3,only last about a year,"Purchased two sets of these now as replacements for my original Hella light covers. They fit well and do the job. Problem is, they only last about a year. The sun and UV rays makes them brittle and then they fall apart when you try to take them off. Good thing they don't really cost a lot. Better plastic would make them a little longer lasting."
3,short life span,"The original ones that came with my lights cracked after a few years, so I purchased these as replacements. However, they are now beginning to crack, but I guess I can't complain since they've lasted several (5?) years."
4,Good Fit,They fit good like the original. The only problem is that they only last about a year or so before they crack when taking them off.
4,Glad i could find these,"So first off, i only bought these because i lost the orignal ones after placing them on my hood to clean the lights.Anyways, i got these (must buy 2 since they are sold separtely) and they fit prefect on my Hella 500's. The original light covers i got were all white with a simple Hella logo in the middle. But i like these one a lot more, they look more Baja-ish??:)"
5,best spot remover ever,"I use to find this spot remover at Walgreens, now the only place seems to be the www. Where ever it's located, it's worth the price. Love it."
2,Could have been tonnes better...,"When I first saw the title of this book, I was honestly quite intrigued and excited. My first thought was, a cross of ""Dawson's Creek"" and a horror movie? This book could easily have been something like that, especially with such a title. It could also have chosen to be a parody of such horror films. Instead, it was as normal as any other Dawson's Creek novel. Normally, I would commend the authors for bringing to life the characters of an excellent show, but here, I criticise them for taking such a normal route with a title like this. It could easily have been called anything else, and it wouldn't make a difference. All I'm saying is that if they want to give it a title like ""Don't Scream"", and have a horror movie set as a premise, they could have woven a far more interesting and refreshing plot together. The book was really quite a disappointment."
1,Save your money for something better,"I have read many books, but this one was not my favorite. I drededly read 100 pages, than put it down. I couldn't bare to read any more. All of the other books in this series are great, but i would save your money, and not buy this one."
2,Save your money!!,"I have read all of the books in the series and love them all except this one. All of the others grab you from the start and don't let go till the end. This one, however, being the exception. It was slow moving and dull and I would strongly suggest buying it used or just going to a book store and plopping in a couch for awhile to read it to save your money. The best one out of the series in my opinion is ""Calm Before the Storm."""
5,Great running shoe for narrow feet,"I have difficulties finding brands and models that fit my narrow and long feet. I've been wearing adidas Supernova models for last 2 years and love them. Great fit, light, sufficient cushion for a >170 pound runner."
4,I love this jersey,I bought this jersey during the World Cup of 2006. It's well made and I enjoy wearing it. The breathable material and long lasting wearablity makes this one a keeper.
5,this thing is a beast,I really like this chain. It is beefy and long. Without being prohibitively heavy. I use it to secure my motorcycle wile at work or school. It is long enough to chain the bike form the side to things like fences or telephone poles. Of course i need to park the bike on the side walk to do this. When there isn't anything to chain it to i lace it through the rear wheel and frame so that the bike can't roll. While any chain is cutable this one is beefy enough to discourage most thieves. I did a lot of reading on what makes a good security chain before buying this one and it meets all my expectations.To secure the bike I use a two step system. Chain the bike to something when I can. Like an iron fence or telephone pole. Then I cover it with an inexpensive non-descript motorcycle cover. And use a small lock and cable to keep the cover on. A cover that is too expensive or expensive looking will attract attention. that and I have really good insurance for when all else fails.
5,Scooter hasn't been stolen yet,"I own a Vespa scooter, and don't have a garage. I live in an urban area, and it's always parked on the street with this chain around it. Hasn't been stolen yet, and it's been three years. What more do you want? Oh, - it's quite heavy, so just be aware of that. The Beast lock is great too. Hasn't rusted despite being outside in all weather - snow, sleet, rain, etc."
2,There's a *reason* most of these tracks are rare...,"I'm a big Clash fan, but this isn't exactly stunning material. A good number of the tracks are nothing more than shameless mucking around; most of the tracks are interesting but ultimately pointless experimentations, instrumentals, and remixes. Worth owning for the dedicated Clash follower; normal people should stick to the band's first five LPs, all of which are essential."
3,Are you a diehard Clash fan? buy this!,"Otherwise, don't. Me, I'm a diehard fan. I would consider this CD 5-star. But, if you don't like the Clash, this will be painful. ""Gates of the West"" and a Casbah remix are the only popular songs on the CD. The ""black market"" songs are good, but they are the roughest of the Clash's works. Buy London Calling and Combat Rock first."
3,bottom of the barrel clash,"I love the clash as much as anybody. But this collection doesn't do them justice. B-sides, outtakes, retakes -- mostly b-quality. Get the rest and then consider getting this if you're a completist or just compulsive."
3,Buy the studio albums instead,"There is absolutely no reason for someone to buy this album unless you have all their studio albums first. I bought this one first thinking it was a studio album, don't be me. This compilation of songs is not spectacular, and doesn't deserve more than 3 stars in my opinion."
3,"I'm left wondering, why??","okay, here's the deal.1) a CD can hold 70+ minutes of material. the original ""Black Market Clash"" was issued on 10"" vinyl, containing 9 songs/remixes, and clocked in at a little over half an hour.2) ""Super Black Market Clash"" contains 21 songs/remixes, with 77+ minutes, BUT LEAVES OUT MATERIAL FROM THE ORIGINAL RELEASE.now, the additions are welcome, don't get me wrong. but WHY leave out material from the ORIGINAL ""Black Market"" when releasing the expanded CD version? Specifically ""Cheat"" (admittedly available on the rereleased green [or blue] album, ""The Clash""), and ""Armagideon Time"" (which originally preceded ""Justice Tonight/Kick it Over"")? I don't get it. Luckily I still have a working turntable. buy this one if you don't have the original, or if you don't own one of the many fabulous versions of ""This is Radio Clash"" once available on vinyl."
3,what's missing?,"i first bought this when it was called just ""black market clash"" and was a 10"" vinyl release back in the early 80's.at first i was thrilled to see it re-released with added bonus tracks but then to my horror i discovered two very disturbing omissions. both ""bankrobboer"" and ""armagideon time"" are NOT on this!i could almost do without having armagideon time but bankrobber is a clash essential. it puzzles me to why they would not include that great song on this disk.so on one hand you get all these other clash tunes that are impossible to get anywhere else but then on the other hand, you don't get bankrobber. (it does however appear on the new clash ""essential"" cd, as well as ""singles"" i believe).all in all, this still remains a must-have for clash fans regardless of their terribly misguided track selection."
2,Less than super Black Market Clash,I was really disappointed in this version of Black Market Clash. The songs that were added don't measure up. They water down what was one of the Clash's best efforts. I have to search to find the jems. Stick with the original Black Market Clash. You'll love it! I think they messed with the mix too. Sound quality is weak!
4,Remastered version unnecessary,"Reissue details: the only noticeable difference is in the packaging. The listings for The Prisoner and Pressure Drop, which were flipped on the original UK CD, are now correct, and the back cover group photo is slightly crisper. The remastering is slightly louder but no cleaner that the original '93 release, so I wouldn't bother replacing it on that account. Annoying why the powers-that-be didn't start by simply expanding on the original EP (this is missing three tracks), but evidently the CD format pulls together the tracks that can't be found elsewhere, so I suppose it follows the original vinyl concept. Either way, it's still a great set of songs that fills the gaps in any fan's Clash collection."
3,Only buy this if you're a huge Clash fan,"This album should only be bought by serious Clash fans who want all their releases. it goes from good to tedious but however is a good historical source to watch The Clash change in the studio. I won't go over every song in huge detail(look at below reviews for that). If you're a new Clash fan go get ""The Clash"" or ""London Calling"" but if you've got all their other stuff by all means get it. You'll find atleast one song you like."
3,not the original but still essential stuff,"ok they omit some stuff from the original black market clash, and there is some experiments that came off better in later versions, but the early singles are great. Worth owning just for ""Gates of the West."""
4,"Sparkly, but note-- not colored","I agree with the previous review. These are a nice size, the setting is pretty, and they are very sparkly. However, the picture made the gems look like a light blue color to me, and they turned out to be clear (i.e., diamond-like). As long as you're okay with that, I would recommend them."
1,Working on the work - AKA teaching,"(...) As a teacher in a school system whose superintendent is forcing teachers to employ her ""beliefs,"" I can only say this is yet another ridiculous attempt to rephrase and rewrite principles of teaching that have existed for years. It is impractical, offers no proof of success, nor any innovative ideas, and will pass within a few years. In the meantime, teachers will continue to teach as well as we have been doing. Don't waste your time!"
1,Working on Creating More Work,"This book takes the most basic teaching principles and turns them into something of a project. The focus seems to me process not product--more of a top down approach in a roundabout way. I agree with the other criticisms that this offers little in the way of new and exciting ideas yet screams of educational lingo in an almost College of Education type of style. Most good educators strive everyday to be more innovative, creative and seek to develop a love for life-long learning in students. Why else would we be in the field? I am not sure that I needed to read this book to remind myself of that when I have 130 students to remind me of my purpose everyday. The reader that said that administrators love this and teachers hate it hit the nail on the head."
5,Powerful,I have a white gold rolex and noticed that it just didn't shine like it had used to. I've used the jewlry solution cleaners from the store and even went and purchased a small ultrasonic jewelry cleaning machine. None of these really cleaned my watch. I just used the cloth last night and it really works. My watch looks like it is completely new... Amazing
5,"Works well on platinum, palladium and silver.","Most of my jewelry is platinum, palladium or silver and these cloths work very well my rings and necklaces. I actually cut each cloth into smaller squares and use them. This way it takes longer to ruin an entire cloth. These work well on my gold-filled brass jewelry items as well."
4,Best Option for Silver Jewelry,"These cloths work great on my silver jewelry, and won't damage the stones the way the dip-type products will. It's also a less messy option to the silver pastes, although some tarnish usually does transfer to my hands. All in all though, this is the best product I have found for keeping my silver jewelry sparkling."
4,Works well,They did a great job of cleaning jewelry. They are a little messy and I would suggest wearing rubber gloves. My hands felt weird when I finished cleaning. I couldn't even wash the film off of them.
4,do not wash these cloths,"I used these cloths to clean a lot of old jewelry, including some that was extremely tarnished, and I found them to be extremely effective. My hands did get covered with tarnish as others have mentioned, but it washed off easily. More importantly, the tarnish just kept coming off onto the cloth.I wish I had known that you are not supposed to wash the cloth itself. With all the black tarnish that gets transferred to the cloths, I was rinsing the cloth out with water after I used it. The tarnish came off, but I guess the cleaning compound did too, because they became less effective after several rinsings. The cloths should come with instructions for their use and care. I have since read on the internet that silver polishing cloths should not be washed - however, I could not find any care instructions that addressed these specific ""sunshine"" brand cloths."
4,Very good item,"These are very good, cleans our jewelry and buffs them very good. You get plenty of them for the money. I will buy more of these for sure."
4,Good Starter Lathe,"I find this lathe to be an exellent starter lathe that will last you for years. You will be unable to turn very large items However it is great for Pens, Bottle Stoppers and items in this size range. This is a better starter for pens than many other lathes if for nothing else due to the variable speed. This saves so much time that I would recomend this lathe for Pens and small stuff OVER the more expensive ones with belts...The only thing I needed to do was smooth out the toolrest surface.."
2,Arrived damaged,"Cannot say much about this machine. Although the shipping box appeared undamaged, it was obvious after opening that the machine had been dropped on end and the electronic controls were all broken. My biggest complaint was that I gave this machine as a Christmas gift, and after I notified Amazon of the damage, they informed me that that no longer carried this lathe, and could not replace it. I was then forced to replece the Wilton machine with a more expensive lathe. Amazon offered me a $10 gift certificate that was supposed to be applied automatically to my next purchase, unfortunately this did not happen either."
5,Great little hobby lathe,Product arrived in great shape and good working order. Quick shipping and smooth transaction. Was exactly what I needed.
2,Looks nice... never even turned it on,"I ordered the lathe via Amazon. Came very quickly... Amazon paid shipping charges (50 pounds). The unit was packed well and had decent instructions. I followed all instructions, but one of the bolts snapped off while inserting it. It was not cross-threaded... Regarding wormanship, it seemed ok, but there were a few burrs. I never even turned it on. I had to return it.I went on line and Amazon's return process was great. They paid for shipping it back too."
1,No parts available from US Distributor,Wilton USA no longer will order parts for this Wood Lathe . I was told that it was a discontinued item .
5,Absolutely fabulous!,"This set is not only practical for indoor gardening but also oh so cute! The size is just perfect for small space and small hands. The quality of the tools is surprisingly good, considering the price. I don't need to buy a garden tool from the big-box stores again! And it came packaged beautifully. You can give it to anyone as a great gift. Highly recommended!"
3,sanding belts,"The belts are just ok, nothing to write home about. The joint is just taped together,not overlapped.The belt does not run flat against the platen on my Delta Sander."
3,It's ok,"Evangelism isn't really all that difficult a concept to be honest. I had this for a textbook for RS undergrad...can't really pick out anything I specifically learned from this book, but it wasn't a bad read."
1,Never received,"Book needed for school and was back ordered. My money was refunded after over a month as once book finally arrived and shipped I was notified it was destroyed by post office. Luckily, author made book available thru my University's Blackboard internet since most of us had ordered the book (which I still have not received) from several suppliers. We are all reading it off the University's internet service chapter by chapter until issue is resolved."
5,dan hartman keep the fire burnin',"dan is great and so is the cd. what a great loss he is, but this cd will let us have him forever!"
3,Disapointing Best Of...,They should have gone with the original versions and not with those stupid remixes. Relight My Fire is the best example. I was not expecting to hear an Instumental/Remix version. Original versions would have given the listeners the real taste of his music.
4,"Oh, how I miss Dan Hartman","This CD is very good, not excellent. I wish he would have included some songs such as ""Love Strong"" and ""Hands Down"". If those cuts were on this CD, it would rate 5 stars, no doubt about it. Dan was the best at making ""feel good"" music that made you want to dance and party-hardy. The content showcases his endless musical talents and imagination. Cuts like ""Living in America"", ""Vertigo/Relight My Fire"", and ""Instant Replay"" are Dan Hartman at his best. We lost a musical giant when he left us, but thank god Dans' music lives on. Anyone needing a great dance/party CD can't miss with this one."
5,What a great book!,"This one's a real pager turner...didn't want to put it down at night. I hope the author writes a follow-up. It's one of those books where you know you're going to miss the characters when you're done. Lots of fun...I laughed out loud. The dialogue is great. The ending was unexpected and exciting...just a what a mystery, murder, thriller is supposed to be."
5,hardcore !!!!!,I love it! its hardcore underground rap from the `93 - rappers screamin like onyx and m.o.p. to some deep funky beats that keep your heads boppin. All tracks are superb - why it took me 11 years to get this album in my hand ??
2,FULL SCREEN ONLY,"Typical example of this type of film.I quite enjoyed it,though a bit slow.FULL SCREEN with Faded Color,though it looks ok,if your not too critical."
3,A lesbian romantic comedy,"A case of coincidentally mixed up romantic hookups is what this movie depends on, and that is not likely at all. So it was not real for me. Still, this is a gentle little movie about the search for Mr or Miss Right, and the complications that can ensue. I was amused by how many scenes show groups drinking from the classic Greek key coffee cups, which have disappeared in NYC to be replaced by Starbucks. Not a mainstream flick, by any means. But I enjoyed my short time with it, ultimately."
2,just ok,"this film felt like a bunch of 3rd and 4th tier actress's and actor's came on board and did a film where there was suppose to be a complex love triangle,but there was suppose to be humor,but it was too dry for it's own good and never got going. this film just seemed like a bunch of other films and nothing seemed to work or click. this film doesn't go anywhere and becomes pretty cliched really fast."
3,Mildly entertaining,I was really looking forward to the release of this film on dvd. I expected great things from it's maker. I was pretty disappointed when I finally got to see it. The film focuses mainly on the 'straight' relationship and none of the characters really have any chemistry. The story was kind of cute and watchable enough but it only really just touched the surface of things. It pretty much played it safe. I guess that's what you have to do if you wanna break in to the mainstream with these kind of subject matters.
3,Amusing comedy of manners,"Elizabeth Reaser is the attractive star of this amusing New York comedy of manners. She plays the defiantly lesbian Allegra who can't seem to commit. When her girlfriend Samantha walks out, Allegra quickly meets two attractive strangers -- philosophy prof. Phillip and glass blowing banker Grace. What she doesn't know is that Phillip and Grace are a long-standing and unhappy couple.Before long, Allegra is cavorting with both (separately), surprised to be enjoying a physical relationship with a man, still trying to work out her commitment issues. Of course, it's only a matter of time until the distraught couple realize they are both sleeping with Allegra. (I'm not giving anything away here -- it's all laid out in the opening scene of the movie.)There's nothing very profound about this film but the acting is good and there are some witty moments, all of which makes it pleasant entertainment."
3,Lovely New York landscape,"On a lovely New York landscape, a tale of a love triangle and friends surrounding emphasizes on a not-so-casually disclosed topic of female bi-sexuality and transvestites as male's one has been present on screen regularly (for instance, Galazio Forema -""True Blue"",20 Centimeters)."
2,"Mediocre attempt of a ""brilliant romantic comedy""","This is a mediocre (not terrible, just mediocre) attempt of a romantic comedy. The story centers around an undecided young woman who can't decide whether she is really a lesbian, whether she loved the last girlfriend who dumped her for her inability to commit, whether she is now in love with a man or maybe with his... ex-girlfriend. As you can imagine, the situation will get complicated very quickly, giving rise to fairly trite situations.Acting is mostly mediocre, and would be just fine for a TV sitcom. Tina Benko and Justin Kirk save the day a bit, but the main character, played by Elizabeth Reaser, is very forgettable, rather silly, and not even very attractive. The dialogue tries hard to be witty, but it ends up in most cases being just trivial and quite unnatural. As other reviewers have pointed out, the screenplay really sounds a like ""Woody Allen for beginners"".Overall, a very forgettable movie, which I will quickly forget."
4,Health Care USA 6th edition,"My class required the 7th edition. I found that purchasing the 6th edition (at a much lower price) worked for my class. It first I was skeptical having the earlier version, so I emailed the publisher, asked and received the 7th edition updates for free. Works for me!"
2,Poorly written,"This book is hard to read. I would rather have a book that is not filled with extra large words, nominalizations and third person perspective. Here is an example:Policy makers and care managers assert that physicians' expressed concern over quality is a way to resist scrutiny and accountability without regard for economic efficiency.And another:In spite of its impressive accomplishments, the American health care system exhibits inexplicable contradictions in objectives, unwarranted variations in performance, effectiveness, and efficiency, and long-standing difficulties in its relationships with the public and with governments.Can you imagine paying $64.95 for this book if you were a student and had to buy it? Why must academics write this way!?!?!Thank goodness I only paid $10 for the used version."
1,I'm going to burn it.,"Anyone who gives this book more than two sacks of llama poop on this site does so because they are a teacher or they misunderstood where you thank the seller for the timely shipping of the book.This book is torturous to read, and it is so deathly boring that I want to cry every time I am required to open it. I am not a stupid person, and I have a rather expansive vocabulary, and though I understand every word that these two morons used to write this book I somehow fail to connect them so that they make much sense. All in all, this book was a waste to read and buy and I'm sorry if you're taking a class that requires it."
4,ahhh...,"Rocking, spacey, oozing, thunderous, ominous... kinda like a lost 1971 Krautrock record that actually LIVES UP to the hype that those kind of records usually (most often undeservedly) get... reference points for Drain'd Boner would include early Guru Guru, 1972-ish Hawkwind (""Where Do We Take U"" would have been Hawkwind's best song ever, if Hawkwind had done it), maybe even early Black Sabbath... but after one hears Brain Donor, one tends to forget about those other bands... at least I did. My favorite record of 2006, by a considerable margin... who would have thought? Not me, for sure... much as I love Brain Donor's earlier work, this new one here is far and away their best. Kudos for the title too - in questionable taste it may be, but it does describe the effect this record has on one's... uh... you know. If you don't know what I mean, take a listen to this record and you'll understand."
1,100% terrible,"do not buy this product. The models on the dvd cover are most certainly not in the film. It is shot in two angles with a cheap video camera in what looks like a dorm room. The ""sensuality"" they claim should be categorized as ""friendly"" at best. The massages that are given would be no more sexy than what your grandmother would give you when you have an achy back. Terrible."
4,Still packs a whollop!! Savior Sorrow is no disappointment!,"Yes, I too admit I was unsure of the direction Mushroomhead would take without J Mann fronting- however, in my view, Waylon does NOT disappoint in the least! This sounds to me very much like early Mushroomhead that I discovered way back when. I agree with other reviewers that if you didn't enjoy Superbuick and other early (pre world tour) releases, you might not like this one. It's much more tune focused- instruments stand out more, it's lyrically strong and has great harmonies, but still packs quite the Mushroomhead whollop over the head beat-wise! Sounds to me sort of like AFI meets Godsmack; Can't wait to see this new Mushroomhead live when they come to Denver :)"
2,Not for old school Mushroomhead fans.,"If you were a fan of Superbuick, M3, and XX... and only mildly enjoyed XIII, stay far away from Savior Sorrow. The absence of J-Mann is like a huge void throughout the entire album. Waylon is good enough to fill in the harsh vocals, but doesnt have the rhythm and flow that Jmann brought to every song. Plus, Waylon sings clean vocals from time to time and sounds very (dare I say) emo-ish. There are a few touches of emo on more than one track(""Save Us"",""Pretend(ing)""....).There a few good tracks on here(""The Doubt"",""Burn"",""Cut Me"") but they're pretty generic and lack the signature Mushroomhead sound.Despite the disappointing new album I still plan to see them on tour Oct. 1st, and I hope they play a lot of old stuff."
5,"Different, but still excellent","I love Mushroomhead's albums XX and XIII, and this one is different, but still great. This album may have more of a mainstream-feel to it, but I owuldn't agree that Mushroomhead has 'sold-out' or tried to change their sound. They still have their same trademark mix of metal, ambiance, and that something extra that cannot be named. The creativity, intensity, and allure of Mushroomhead's music is still here. If you liked XX and XIII, give Savior Sorrow a try. It may not be to your liking, but then again it may, like it was for me."
3,eh...,"you have to give mushroomhead credit for soldiering on after all these years. I think they are the type of band that will have a loyal following, but will never quite hit the big time. anyway, regarding this release, I would say it's just ""ok."" nothing horrible, but nothing to write home about either. mushroomhead songs don't show much variety. I think the band definitely suffered with the departure of j. mann. waylon does a good enough job, but he sounds too much like j. mann and offers nothing new. if you are a diehard fan, you will buy this anyway. if you are new to mushroomhead, give it a shot, but don't expect to be blown away by it."
4,Another Incredible Release,"I was impressed by Savior Sorrow. Although their second full length release was better, this really hits hard. And the new singer fills in just fine. I suggest to buy this cd."
1,3 1/2 years for this?,"Waylon sounds like a whiney little kid. He can't rap either. I guess they forgot when they picked him that the fan favorite ""Bwomp"" was basically J rapping. Sorry people, Mushroomhead is just another generic emo band now. I am embarresed that I waited in so much anticipation for this album, and just a little pissed off. The bottom line is this sucks. Pull out your copy of XX and mourn the loss of a once great band.R.I.P. Mushroomhead"
1,"not a kid, but an old-school MRH fan...","Mushroomhead upon releasing this album, have essentially told the world that they are ready to be accepted as a mainstream act. If you are a fan of the ingenuity, intensity and creativity found on their previous efforts, you will be dissapointed. I found a few traces on here of a once great band, but as one person had mentioned before it wholly sounds like some alt-rock radio band emulating mushroomhead. This makes me gag."
1,Such a waste...,"After hearing every other Mushroomhead offering, I thought they were on a good turn when they did ""The End Of All Things To Come.""However, upon hearing this borrowed CD, I was more than happy to give it back. Borrow it first, or d/l it from somewhere...then hear it for yourself. You'll hear how low MH has sunk to make this crappy CD."
1,Everything that's wrong with metal nowadays! Garbage!,"Hard rock/metal's best years (generally speaking), creatively and musically, were the 70's and 80's HANDS DOWN. Musicians back then could actually sing and play their instruments with ungodly style, melody, virtuosity, great hooks, and artistic talent compared to these current 'Nu-Metal' assclowns. Gimmicky, schlocky pseudo 'metal' bands like Slipknot, Korn, and Mushroomhead come along and pollute the genre with their disjointed, infantile screaming (not singing) and jackhammer guitars. Typical fare for musically stunted, pimply mallrat teens from troubled homes- or should I say trailers. This one is destined for the 'bargain bin'!"
3,Bland work from an otherwise great band.,"Compared to the effort put forth on XX and XIII, Savior Sorrow feels largely uninspired. Many of the tracks on this album are forgettable, and scarcely resemble the work of a band that was able to turn Alt-Metal into something unmistakably unique. Instead, we're left with detritus that could have been churned out by any number of corporate rock radio acts. There are some bright spots on this album, but it's only worth checking out after you've gotten all the mileage that you can out of the band's previous releases."
4,"The Belding Series - WASHINGTON, A Pictorial Book","Ray Atkeson has photographed Washington and the Pacific Northwest for more than thirty eyars. He was born and schooled in the Midwest. Here is Washington as seen by Ray Atkeson and as described by Carl Gohs, a state with more saltwater shoreline greater than the distance from Boston to Miami. For more than three decades (1938-1969), Atkeson has been photographing the Pacific Northwest, and for nearly a decade Gohs has been writing about it. Atkeson has photographed Switzerland, Alaska, Hawaii, New England, the American West and especially the Pacific Northwest and Washington. He has always sought that special, very personal view. A beautiful book, and hard to believe that the color plates of the book were put together in 1969."
4,Great for the Music Historian,"This CD is great for the music historian. It features selections from the World's Greatest Entertainer from 1913 through the early 30's.This CD is well remastered, but even modern technology can only do so much. The songs recorded before 1925 were sung into a horn to cut the record, so even with the best technology, it sounds like you are hearing Jolson through a garden hose or tunnel. The selections done with the use of a microphone (1925 and after) sound quite a bit better.Fans who want to get as much of Jolson as they can to complete their collection will definitely want this one; folks who want to hear clean, clear, and potent Jolson would do better to buy CD's based on his recordings from the 40's (Best of the Decca Years, or Jolson Live, for example)."
3,Baseball and Billions Book Review,"Baseball and Billions by Andrew Zimbalist is an okay book. In my opinion it is not an outstanding book because it just gave too many numbers and charts that quite didn't make sense to me, even though I do like the sport. While reading this book by Andrew Zimbalist I did learn some interesting facts about baseball that I never knew of before reading this book. Even though it might start off interesting, later in the book, in my opinion,it just gets a bit boring. Out of 5 stars I give this book 3 stars."
3,Like it just ok,"This is your basic baby massage oil. I like it because of the natural ingredients. I wish it had a nicer smell, however I like that there aren't any synthetic fragrances. I use it after I give my son a bath, but to be honest, I like the California Baby massage oil better. But I do love this Earth Mama baby balm-that stuff rocks!"
3,It could be better,"This book does offer a lot of basics when it comes to theatrical drafting, but there are quite a few mistakes both within the text and in the worksheets given. It would be much better if updated."
4,"Good reference, sometimes poor quality","This was the assigned textbook for my Drafting class and is very useful and full of great information. However, some of the diagrams and examples have fuzzy/blurry lines and it is sometimes hard to read the small letters and labels related to the examples. I can usually tell what it says, but sometimes have to squint or get REALLY close to read it. Other than that, it would have been five stars, but it just seems so simple to have clear printing in this day and age, but this doesn't."
4,review,"The book is good, but there were some pages that were torn out and a few pages with markings on it. Other than that it's a good book."
4,Takes A Stand For What Others May Indict As Un-Cool,"I'm a pop music whore. Yeah, you heard me. Some snobs might take offense, intuiting that this claim somehow reneges their otherwise impeccable knowledge of modern music. But not me, and not Nick Hornby, either. The author of About a Boy and High Fidelity, Hornby has always been known as a music author, this sentiment personified and cemented by his recent collection entitled Songbook. More accessible than Lester Bangs, Hornby strikes a balance between personal experience and critique; I commend him for his faith in pop music and taking a stand for what others may indict as un-cool.[...]"
4,Nick Hornby's Mix Tape to the World,"*sigh* this is the kind of stuff you'd like to write about every mix tape you ever made. this is the kind of stuff you try and try and try to say but since you can't find the words you just add a song to the tape that most closely reflects what you're trying to convey. hornby's so admirable. it's not easy to come up with words about songs written by other people, and hornby does it so well."
3,Good for its intent,"Hornby does exactly what he tells the reader he will do: he discusses why he likes certain songs.Now, if you don't share Hornby's taste in music, or if you are searching for well-formed aesthetic arguments, this book is not for you.But if you enjoy any of the songs in this book (which actually come from quite an array or genres) and are looking for a light read, this book is probably for you."
3,Worthwhile,"I'm a big fan of Hornby so had to get this. It's taken me over a year to read it. Some parts are brilliant, some are okay and some are dull. It's the dull ones that cause me to put the book down for long periods. I like the way Hornby thinks, he just always seems so clued up on modern life and people. I had a major problem with the Songs as I didn't recognise 29 of them. Now, the book is written so you don't NEED to be familiar with them but I know it would have helped my apreciation of the book, as would a greater love for music than I have. The book is mostly about what certain songs have meant to him in his life and the idea is that the reader will also feel a link while reading. Which I did for the most part but...so frustrating not knowing these songs. I can see from other reviewers that you can now get a CD for it which you couldn't when I got the book. I would strongly advise people to get the CD as well. Good luck."
3,not worth it.,"It was hard to get into the book after chapter 2. It turned into this rant about this song was a good choice for ""About A boy"" and this song wasn't, and I listened to this song when writting About a Boy. The opening chapter about Springsteen's thunder road was great, then the book just fizzled. The end of the book is filled with top ten lists thatyou'd find on any average person's website: pure filler."
2,I don't know these songs!,"I adore Nick Hornby. Everything else he has written I give 5 stars, and I could rave about those books without end. But unfortunately I recognized extremely few of the songs covered in this collection of his essays, and it kind of spoiled it for me.Now, I do realize that this is a fault of my own and not of the author. I think that this would have been a much more enjoyable book for me if I had been more familiar with the material.If you are considering reading this book, I would strongly advise perhaps downloading some of the songs or otherwise getting some ground on these artists before reading essays on their work. Even with an amazingly talented author like Hornby, you don't want to read 200 pages of essays when you have no background in the subject."
1,"Great Idea, No pay back","My wife gave me this book for my Birthday. The idea was wonderful and I was intrigued. I had never read Nick Hornby, but I am a fan of High Fidelity. That night I went to bed the book and my kid's CD player. I started off well until I got to the 2nd essay ""Thunder Road"". Nothing on the CD. Now I suppose that I could find this song fairly easily, but since there are 31 essays and only 12 tracks on the CD I quickly got totally uninterested in the book. Why would anyone want to read about a tune that he didn't know or could listen to at the same time. I figure copyright must be the hangup, but I honestly can't imagine ""The Boss"" refusing to let a recognized author use an old song to gain a glowing review that might be read by thousands of readers. The book will remain unread & unlistened toat my house."
4,Good Writing,"It's a credit to this book that I only know one single song mentioned in it, yet I've still found it interesting to read. The author's passion for music is clear, and I've enjoyed reading the details of why certain songs have touched him. He isn't afraid to talk about his feelings about music, about performers, and about the things that were happening in his life that meant certain music affected him. I like having this insight into an author's mind.I do wish I'd known some of the music from this book, though. I've made a list and plan on finding much of this music, and perhaps then I will reread it and see if I have a different impression after listening to the music. However, it was a good read even without knowing the songs referenced."
3,A good mix tape...,"in that it tells you all about the author, for better or worse. Hornby, although brilliant, has an unabashedly sentimental streak in his musical taste and the mix tape (that is the book) is the least dangerous I've ever encountered. I applaud his attempts, but there are no surprises here, nothing to make the heart quicken."
2,Its not worth to buy,"I ve been using this mouse for almost a week now! The first day i got the mouse, it looked pretty kool to me. Was very small handy and light weight, however the installation guide wasn't very helpful but i still managed to install it in less than 5 minutes. The bad thing started the next day when i realized the next morning that though the mouse was turned off it just comsumed up all the battries which were included in the package, i ve changed the battried though and those are working fine now for the 3rd day. Another bad thing about it is that it won't work well on all the surfaces. It requires some non-reflecting and rough surface for best results."
3,Works well with fresh batteries,"The Smart Receiver Storage in the body of the mouse is a great idea. Contrary to a review I read before my purchase, the batteries do not last months. I'm finding, to my dissappointment, that I need to replace the two triple 'A' batteries every two weeks. I rated it a '3' because I don't know if other brands have the same problem."
2,Not at all for beginners,This is not a book for beginners at all. I think it is probably well suited for someone with several years of SQL Administration under their belt who wants to get up to speed with new features of SQL Server 7.0 or needs a reference. More than half of the book is reference and the rest of it is so vague and incomplete I was completely lost.
1,Mistitled,"The title of this book should be ""SQL Server 7 for SQL Server 6.5 DBAs"". Almost half the book is ""what's new in 7.0"" and the rest is a quick overview (yes, quick, despite the fact that it's almost 1000 pages!) and incomplete (try finding a list of string manipulation functions like substring() or rtrim() -- good luck!) of SQL Server 7 syntax. When I have a question, I don't even bother with this book, I go straight for my five-year-old copy of _SQL Server 6.5 Unleashed_."
3,Not a good book for beginners,This book is written for the user that is familiar with SQL server. It is especially focused on showing users of previous users of SQL Server what is different in SQL Server 7. Good reference manual
1,Strong DBA's - Look Elsewhere!,"If you are looking for a book that goes into the details of how the new clustered index key pointers in nc indexes work, or if you are curious about how SQL Server handles IO with multiple files in a file group... or anything the least bit technical, then don't consider this book. The book is poorly written as well. Most of the paragraphs end in some useless subjective sentence that shamelessly applauds Microsoft."
2,The Complete Disappointment,"I bought this book in the hopes that it would cover the new stuff in 7.0 in some detail, specifically distributed servers. Instead, as all the others have said, it's a rehash of the manual. It's coverage of other topics is almost like a sales pitch instead of a how-to guide.However, if you need a reference in book form, this is it. That bumped it up from one star for me."
2,Not the complete reference,"I'm a Network Administrator who doubles as a SQL DBA and I found this book to be pretty unhelpful. Whenever I went to look for instructions on how to do something, it didn't deliver practical help."
1,Watered Down Overview,"If you're interested in knowing the big picture of SQL Server 7.0, this book is for you. However, if you're like most of us DBAs and Designers, you need a little more information than ""what's new with SQL Server 7.0"". I want to know *how* to make the application work! I found this book to be generally useless."
1,Not worth bothering,"As the title indicates, this book is not useful for much more than as a reference book for people who already know how to use SQL server 7.0. I would not recommended for someone who has not already used SQL server. I am a regular SQL/Oracle developer, but the book provides no real handle on how to get started with SQL server 7.0 - creating DB, queries, reports, etc. It has just a description of the various Microsoft SQL server bells and whistles."
4,greedy random house digital,"random house continues to be greedy with their meager discount of the paperback version , with its high overhead compared to nearly zero overhead of digital versions of a book. i am pro-business, but anti-greed."
4,Non-orthodox.,"Excellent book, fine informations in this research, many fine details in the description of the evolution of the Guru Granth Sahib. Good comparisons to mostly muslim habits. Interesting for any students."
4,Excellent look back,This album is an excellent look back at one of the early rockers and an inspiration to many currnet and former singers. There is a good mix of some of E.C.'s songs. Too bad an early demise prevented more from this talented young man.
1,Poor Quality,Received the product in anticipation of listening to a restored classic but instead I can barely hear it. I placed it in my CD player and pushed play and heard nothing. I thought there was something wrong with the player but to check I put in one of my old CD's and it played fine. I put Blind Willie back in and pushed play and still nothing. I adjusted the volume almost to max and then I could barely hear it. I put in other CD's the I purchased at the same time as Blind Willie and the same poor quality. I guess I will be returning the whole set soon. Very disappointed.
2,I was disapointed to say the least,"As difficult as it is to find information on the art of topiary, this disapointing book gives a very vague picture. Perhaps the most frustrating thing about the book is the illustrations. It seems more like a comic strip than an information resource. For instance the 3 or 4 pages given to standards shows hand drawn renderings that look like my 5 year old drew them. It is interesting that they devoted so many pages to different types of wire shapes. It seems obvious to me that vines will grow on a rack shaped like a bird, and they will grow on a rack shaped like an elephant. I just didn't ""get"" showing us all the different shapes, and giving them all their own page. Good book for the novice, check it out at the library however, there isn't much reason to own it."
3,topiary,"The book is lacking in some of the specifics of forming the topiary shapes, but has some good ideas throughout."
1,unsatisfied,It is so ridiculous that enclosed art reproductions of those great in color artists have been presented in the book in black/white. Very disappointed!
2,NOT THAT GREAT,"I bought this tape along with ""The Navy SEAL Workout Challenge"" and I liked ""The Navy SEAL Workout Challenge"" a lot better. This tape is not fun to follow. It didn't keep me motivated like The Navy SEAL Workout Challenge. I think it's a waste of money."
5,versatile and useful,"I love this stuff. I use it to wrap, to make bags, to protect things while traveling especially useful now htt you have to pack liquids and gels etc. The freezer one is good too for doing individual hambergers etc. I took this to poland for some friends and now I have to ship it over there once a year as they fight over it hehe."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I've been using Dispoza-a-Scoops for years, but recently their quality control seems pretty pathetic. The box of pooper scoopers I opened this week was the worst, though. One bag had no bottom seam and the rest either had seams that split under the slightest pressure or the plastic bag itself just split open. You can imagine how fun that was, strolling along with a bag full of dog poop ... and having the bag split open and spill its contents at (and on) your feet. Yuck.I tried to send an email to the manufacturer, letting them know about the problem, but every address I used (found on their website) was a dud. The messages just bounced right back to me. So maybe they've gone out of business, or just don't want customers to bother them.Bummer. I guess it's back to the plastic-bag technique."
1,Great product; awful experience.,"I've been buying these at Petco for over a year and the problem has always been that the stores can't keep them on the shelves. Taking care of the dog's business has always made me squeamish. I bought these expecting to get them in three to four days, but expedited shipping wasn't available and the projected arrival date was a week later. I got the product 16 days after ordering it. When I attempted to get an estimated arrival time from the vendor (at seven days), the reply was ""soon."" Thanks for all the dry heaving, As Seen On TV."
5,SURE BEATS A PLASTIC BAGGIE!,"OK, so these are a little pricey, but you will look a LOT more suave walking down the street holding one of these than a tied up grocery bag full of poo. I am addicted to them. In deep grass, it can be a little tough to ""scoop"" into the bag, but no much different than the old fashioned way."
4,Refreshing,I enjoyed this book very much. I read Copeland's other two novels--June and Faith and I honestly didn't enjoy them all that much but I did enjoy Hope. It definately is a must read.
5,I love the Brides of the West Series,"Lori Copeland brings these characters right into your home and heart with a way that makes you feel like you could drop right into the story at any time. Her writing style is descriptive without being wordy. Unlike many other authors who feel the need to interrupt word flow between characters with inane commentary or thoughts going on in the character's mind, you want the conversation between characters to flow naturally and it does! I like the Christian message weaved throughout the stories without the preachy and all get ""saved"" in the end, even the ""bad guys"" so unnatural in many other Christian historical romances. I highly recommend reading this book, this series and all the Lori Copeland books! You won't be disappointed!"
4,Hope story,This a enjoyable light easy reading book. it has a good christian message and has some humor on it. enjoyed it.
5,Great book,This book was super good! Really clean and funny. You wont regret getting this book. If you like this book try some of her other storys as well.
5,Good to my soul,I have read the series and I think this was my favorite. It is different writing from the others. It is funny too. You will be glad you read it.
4,"Out of Faith, Hope, and June, the only one worth reading","I liked this book. I thought the plot was well-developed and the romantic relationship was developed completely and satisfyingly. This was in contrast to Lori Copeland's other books of Faith and June. I found the character and plot development in those to be very weak. Hope is the last book in the trilogy, but do NOT feel that you need to read the first two to be able to understand the last one. Save your money and only buy Hope."
5,Affordable and a perfect fit,This is the one you need if the top looks correct. The product fit perfectly. I have been searching for this filter for over a year in my surrounding stores. They just don't carry one. My fridge is not a GE either.
3,how do you rate when you can't unscrew the old one off,"We bought it thinking it should be easy to replace. Then we found out we could not unscrew the old filter. If we force it off, we may not be able to use the ice maker. Now it just sits there."
4,Works to replace Culligan filter,Contrary to other reviews it can be used to replace Culligan filter on GE Profile refrigerator. Works perfectly fine. You don't need the other filter & adapter.
4,fills a void in your collection,"You will find more recent books and references that are more complete and informative, but if you really like F-15's this must be part of your library. A bit short on info but plenty of illustrations. Good modelling reference, which was its intent. Because of its age it covers earlier versions, but that can be a good thing."
5,A Quest Worth Undertaking,"Finally, a book about philosophy that doesn't take a PHD to understand, one that emphasizes it's daily utilization in all phases of living. Everyday Philosophy is readable, practical and applicable.Bammel states that the search for wisdom is, and always has been, the driving force behind philosophy, and that wisdom should be the quest of us all. He doesn't provide answers to major moral questions, but through insight into the thinking of the Masters, he facilitates them.The importance of the book can not be overstated, particularly as it reflects on life's choices. But, as Bammel suggests, it should be read slowly, in small segments. It's too important to take lightly."
3,Cheaper than a new $80 lens,"It took 3 years for a rock to chip the Hella; I'm willing to wait 3 more to see of this pays off.It arrived properly packed, and on time."
2,Under ground house,Seems just a collection of ideas based on ideas. Save for the photos of the one house with a dirt view out the front.
2,"Some good info, author is a bigot","I bought this book based on other reviews and was disappointed in the author's narrow mindedness and intolerance for anyone who thinks even a little different than he does. The author gives ammunition to the very people he despises to rightfully call him a ""wacko"". It's sad that he can't just let people see this for the beautiful idea that it is and not a political statement. Still, if you look past the seriously disturbed rantings, this is an interesting ""how I did it"" book with some consideration for how you can do it too."
3,Not quite what I expected.,An O.K. read for someone still stuck in the 60's. I found the 50 dollar house most interesting in design but the book done an about face and went from funky to far out in it's illustrations of various designs.Who on earth would keep a loaded gun in a house where children seem to be ocassional guests?(Check the pictures closely and you will see what I mean).
4,A little rough around the edges,Well thought out and covers pretty much everything I can think of for this style of building. the pictures are a bit dark but they get the basic message across.
4,$50.00 Underground House Book,"If you are looking for DIY instructions to build a basic inexpensive underground structure, this should fit the bill nicely."
2,Should be retitled Impromtu Shelter,"I was expecting to learn alot from this highly rated book, but some of the methods are so basic I could have thought of them without buying the book. I was expecting to learn about various types of shelters. I think this book is a little over rated."
4,Romantic Piano Music,"One of the most famous opening lines in all music, graceful, arching melodies and full-bodied romantic sentiment throughout. This is Grieg's Piano Concerto in a nutshell. Thibaudet, Gergiev and the Rotterdam Philharmonic do a fantastic job of capturing the energy and pleasure of this score. The sound quality is superb. The piano shines but never is out of balance with the orchestra. Gergiev should get a special mention for his orchestral support, lilting and effectual. Gried has probably never sounded better - both sensitive and when necessary, passionate. The Chopin Piano Concerto does not have the same visceral melodic thrills as does the Grieg, but it is extremely pleasant going down. Chopin provides the polished piano technique that Grieg does not - however his orchestral colors are a little stiff. Overall though, this is an well programmed disc with outstanding performances and sound quality to boot."
2,Fingers a bit short,"I have big hands, hence the XXL size.I found when my hand was extended the gloves fit fine, but when I closed my hand the seam in the fingers dug into my fingers.This will always be the case that fingers will get tighter, but they should have considered this when designing the seam across the finger tips.These are apparently made for big stubby fingered men."
3,Catchy Bounce Cut,One of those Cuts that was on Point for the Summer.Fat Joe held it down on the flow even though He is trying hard to channel Biggie.catchy cut&you can Bop your Head to it.
2,ok,"Its ok even tho Fat Joe cant ""LEan Back"" cause he's too fat.And thats all I have to say about that."
4,"Nice information, but nothing I didn't already have","I think this is a good book for beginning gardeners who are just starting to get a sense of what makes great soil. It covers the basics in a thorough, organized way. More experienced gardeners aren't going to find much new here, though having it all in one place is helpful. As the part-owner of a commercial organic farm, some information I was hoping for is just not here: how do you remedy soil structure problems on a large scale? How do you handle cover crops when a pitchfork isn't adequate? But for the backyard garden this book is perfectly adequate. Some standouts are the sections on managing soil diseases without chemicals and triple-bin composting. A good resource."
5,building soil,to build a better (tastin)g) garden you need the right soil condition and this book was a very good start
5,P-10 hogue grips Amazon,Grips were shipped promptly and were easy to install. My fingers have arhritis and I highly recommend the extra grip from not being able to completely close my hand. Great product. Hogue's are on all my handguns.
2,So unrealistic it ruins the movie,"Only watched about half the movie, became bored with it after a while. It is very old fashioned so you have to get past that to enjoy the film. The scenes where the dog attacks are very scary. The movie is really very unrealistic because the dog comes home with blood all over it and the owner thinks nothing of it (completely dumb), and then when the dog attacks someone in front of everyone, she takes it to get retrained. In real life the dog would have been killed and this would not have been an option. After knowing that the dog attacked someone and probably others before that (because of the blood it had all over it) I cant understand why the owner would even want the dog to live."
1,FAKE,CRITERION OWNS THE RIGHTS FOR THE RELEASE OF WHITE DOG AMAZON NEED TO TAKE THIS VERSION OUT FROM THE LIST.
1,Horrible B movie,"I bought this movie thinking this was going to be a gem, having been left unreleased all these years for allegedly its content.But what a disappointment.The movie starts off with the dog getting hit. There is no plot development. And from there there is no character development, either. Every character remains shallow and flat. And that horrific loud background music so typical of B movies!!!The dialogue, the camera, the storyline...all was so boring. The movie was more something that was aired on late-night TV of the 1970s.The end was predictable.The message of the movie was well-intended but the final product was an under-performing B movie."
1,BITE ME,"Horrible, tedious, and shallow. It fails on every level. The dialog is insipid, and the acting never leaves the ground. It's not the actors' fault, though. You can tell they weren't getting any direction. The script drops the lead character (who is flatly drawn to begin with) 30 minutes into the film. The premise of the movie, the central metaphor, has a lot of potential, but the director/writer failed to take advantage of it. When you take on a subject as controversial as racism, you should do it justice by delving into the material, showing how racism works in the lives of the characters. Instead, the characters in this film all express sanitized, politically correct points of view--they are all untouched by the reality of racism. The film coyly situates itself as dealing with ""controversial subject matter"" but it is in fact very superficial. There is nothing at stake here, the characters go through no significant changes. I give it two paws down."
5,Didn't See That One Coming!,"I watched this movie as soon as I received it. I kept hearing and reading reviews about this movie and had to see it for myself. Well, where shall I begin. Although this movie is old and more than likely looked upon as a ""B"" movie...I loved it. The message was more than clear and racism, like the people who teach it, learn it and live by it, is an abomination. I was truly touched and because I am an animal lover there was a moment in the movie (towards the end) that actually bought me to tears. After that, the tears just kept on flowing. I went from one emotion to the next. The ending absolutely floored me. I can't wait to pass this movie on to my friends, as I'm sure they will enjoy it just as much as I did."
2,Crazy message in this movie.,"WARNING; Partial spoiler, though does not tell the end. As soon as the dog attacked the lady he should have been put down. Sorry I love dogs a lot, but if he had been put down right then a terrible tragedy would have been averted. It was crazy for someone to want to ""cure"" him when he was a potential threat. This is not a child's movie, especially not for a black child."
4,hitch,product shipped quicker than expected all hardware in package graet product was used first day it arrived would recommend to others
2,actually pretty solid,"i like this over all but its strange how the actual hitch part where the ball attaches is tilted down, you can kinda see it in this picture. nothing has fallen off at all yet so guess it still works well! the other thing that annoys me is that it has the heavy duty nuts and bolts you would have to wrench on and off every time you wanted to change the height of the ball! replaced the hardware with quick disconnect pins and works a ton better!"
2,nope,The hitch was loose on my truck..the bolts were very cheap...and just did not feel safe towing anything with it. Spend the money and get a better quality product.
5,"Intellectual, cultural tour de force -ending blew me away!","This is a great book for artists, specifically passionate,cutting-edge artists who loathe the mundane. And it's awonderful 'detective' story, with surprise endings. Yes, that'sa plural - it delivers one-two-three K.O.'s right up to thevery end...don't miss the final ""Editor's Note,"" either. I lovea literary roller coaster ride, and this book is one of those, with, as mentioned, a Big Finish.The book made me want to jump on a plane to Rome,as well. My mouth watered, thinking of all thosegorgeous Caravaggios I haven't seen. Or at least I'll gosearcing for a ""complete works of..."" art book with full color repros.Where has Atl Naess been all my life? Plan to read more, ifI can get my hands on his work."
1,Displeased,I was displeased with the description of the item in relation to the final product i recieved.
3,An interesting but looooooong ride.,"Tom Levinson's quest is to talk to a kaleidoscope of Americans about their religions and their faiths. `All That's Holy' highlights the religious plurality that can be found in America today, from the fundamentalist to the funky `Coffee Messiah'. Tom's writing, while not gripping is engaging, informative and colorful. His vignettes and insights offer lessons to learn, ""We are all backpackers in this world.""Beware, that this book is like taking a cross-country GREYHOUND bus trip. You climb aboard with anticipations, initially you are enchanted with the world that passes by, but after a time the scenery pans into a blur, and the images are no longer unique and the tedium returns. Ultimately, after 300 plus pages, and with only a momentary interruption by the sensational, I found myself both relieved and happy to have reached the end. Recommended."
2,Better next time.,"I have been reading the supernatural genre for over 20 years, and I can honestly say this book was awful. I rarely say that. I found too many similarities to other authors.1. Death Dealers - Underworld2. Daywalkers - Blade3. Lust Magic - LKH (For new reviewers Laurel K Hamilton)4. Procreating Vampires - Nancy KilpatrickAnd I found all these before page 118.The dialog is grating and the lead charactor is wishy washy, If your going to kill something, kill it already, stop threatening.In short the charactor Samantha is weak. It was almost as if getting raped by Sevastian was okay, a stronger character would have killed him for making her feel violated and dealt with the consequences later. And why all the hard to get with Sion? This book was not what I was lead to believe. I will borrow the next book if I ever read this author again. I will not spend my dimes on it, and the copy I have is NOT going on my Keeper Shelf."
1,Couldn't even finish reading it,"I rarely write anything negative but I had to this time for the sake of other readers. The book seemed written without a lot of thought or no outline - it just didn't flow or make much sense, had words spelled incorrectly, grammatical errors, and honestly it seems like no one reviewed it, edited it, or proofread it after it was written. The main character's reactions, comments, and behavior are over the top and ridiculous, there is no real character development or depth, the way the characters talk to each other is just silly, it's hard to really care about anyone in the book. Near the beginning of the book, one character meets another, then in the next couple pages, acts like he has no idea who the character he just met was! (something that could easily have been caught by an editor). I love this genre, and until this book, I have been thrilled with all the different authors whose books I've read. I couldn't even finish the book and that is almost unheard of for me!"
5,Not usually into Vampires,"But enjoyed this book. I'm not one to give my opinion, but it was such a good read I had to tell someone.Sion Baptiste was a god!!Samantha strong and sassy.My kind of woman!"
2,Main character is not very likable....,"I didn't care for the way the story was written (many sentence fragments with little punctuation - not easy to read) nor did I like the ""heroine"" who wound up having sex easily with everyone but the person she had a relationship with. The situations, sex, violence all seemed contrived and gratuitous to me."
3,"Good story, bad grammer","Ok, i read a lot of supernatural romances and this one is so-so. The story had a lot of potential, my only issue w/ the book was all the grammatical errors..I mean oh my god! A high school fresman could have written better! I was so sick of re-reading Sion Baptiste's name over and over again. What's wrong with just calling him Sion? I will probably read the sequels because the actually story was pretty good...but i hope she gets a new publisher! If there were no errors in this book i would have definetely given it a higher score..."
5,a delicious history,"I bought this because I'd heard of Mrs. Tawes' splendid recipes. She did not disappoint. These are simple, delicious and each time I make one I remember that I'm carrying on a great Maryland tradition. Try the Turtle Soup (Secret: I make it with chicken.)"
3,My kids were not impressed,"I bought these for my husband to keep at work, but thought my kids would like to help taste-test. They wouldn't even finish a 1/2 ball each, lol. I ended up eating each of theirs. Pretty dry and tasteless, but apparently good for you."
3,Healthy Food!,"These spirulina ginseng bars are good for you, but have an unusual taste. I've decided not to take them on my next backpacking trip."
5,"Love, Love, Love these!","Guys, you really should get these little green spirulina-ginseng balls! My two college kids practically beg to get them! :-) My husband and I also love to have a few with us on trips. Great snacks. Great taste compared to a lot of healthfood snacks. Clean and green and healthy for you!We actually put BETTY LOU'S SPIRULINA-GINSENG BALLS in our Christmas Stockings this year and everyone cheered!Do yourself a favor. Buy the big canister. They are tons cheaper this way and you won't run out as fast."
4,very nice audio and video,"The audio and video quality are very good on this dvd. The video looks almost like a bluray dvd and it sounds great too. If you love jazz and some of the Crusader's favorite old songs, I strongly recommend this dvd. I love it .......... i've watched it over & over."
4,You'll enjoy this concert!,"This is a must hear concert for Crusaders fans. Just sit back and enjoy the music. Turn the volume up! I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd and like ""being there"" experience. The sound was excellent, despite the audio not actually being in 5.1 surround. I couldn't get my system after alot of tweaking and adjusting to send any audio to the center channel. However, I didn't notice this until I actually went over to the center channel. If you can set your receiver to mix in ""DPL IIx Music"" mode the sound will be just fine. The mix is still very clean and crisp, Randy Crawford still sounds great. The whole band was ""tight"". The price was best at Amazon too."
4,Good ring bearer pillow,"I ordered this ring bearer pillow, and was pleased with the product. It had a reasonable price and went with the color and theme of my wedding. I will say that its rather simple and plain, but it is very versitile. With this product you could easily add your own embellishments of little crystals, colored flowers, some swirls of gold glitter or even ribbon. The quality was good, the stiching was all intact and there wasnt any defects in the thread.So if you are looking for something inexpensive, and versitile then I'd say this pillow is for you!"
3,"Not the best Stanley, but...","When listening to this album, you have to keep in mind it is indeed a SOUNDTRACK. The songs were written to fit the film, and Stanley Clarke is good at it. ""Lisa"" and ""Cutter's Theme"" are definitely the best tracks -- both are highly melodic and leave you humming the tune. The rest of the album gets a little repetitive, so I would leave this to big Stanley Clarke fans."
3,Cooking for the Inexperienced,I didn't keep the book but gave it to my 23 year old grandson who was moving into his first apartment. I'm waiting to get his reaction. Interesting to me was the format which reminded me of a child's book with its cardboard covers and pictured ingredients. He can barely use a can opener but should not be intimidated by the book's user friendly approach.
1,Not Good for the price,Not many good recipes especially for the price of this ebook. I wish I had my $ back. Would be much better off going to food.com or allrecipes.com and searching for microwave cooking. Was very disappointed.
3,"Good Insights, though must think through","This book gives some good insights as to the important aspects of missions in the Christian life; however, care must be taken as the book is read as there are some issues the book flounders on. No matter which side of the various issues one may fall upon, it does cause the reader to give thought to another side of something which they had not previously thought of. In my case, it drove me to find why I believe what I believe regarding missions, and made me understand my own views even better. This book will make you think!"
5,set free,awesome cd! I love Steve's music and plan to teach our folkgroup some of these! It is so worth listening to.
2,Good but disapointed,Im a big Baltimore Ravens fan.But this DVD didnt have captioning i have no idea what theyre saying Im totaly deaf. There ought to be a law all DVDs must have a captioning system installed.
2,A monotonous repetition of pharmaceutical details,"The author, although well intentioned and somewhat informative , produced a rather dull repetition pattern , going over each supplement in identical fashion.Important topics such as ingestion procedures/schedules and ortomolecular deficiency exams are overlooked.Struggled to get to the end......."
5,Great Product!,"Since I purchase scrapbooking supplies with a specific page idea in mind, these page planners are perfect for keeping the elements together until I can tackle the project. They also cut down on the amount of time spent searching for just the right color cardstock or ribbon, important since I am not a particularly fast scrapper to begin with!"
4,Now I hold my crotch 'cause I'm Top Notch...,"Anyone who samples that classic De La line is on point.First time I heard Kurious was on the KMD track ""Stop Smokin' That Sh*t"" and I loved what I heard.As frontman for the ""Constipated Monkeys"" crew, Kurious puts together a very good album. The Beatnuts handle the majority of the beats, so the production is dope, other production is by Prime Minister Pete Nice & The Stimulated Dummies.Although he's quite an average MC, his presence and laid-back style fits the production and makes the album vibe really well. There's no real stand-out tracks, instead every song is really good, and a complete album you can listen to straight through is way better than an album of singles and filler.Bottom Line: This album is so slept-on, every old-school head should own it. If you don't own it - wake up and cop it. 4 stars, Peace."
4,...,"This is without a doubt one of the most underrated albums of the early(mid) nineties. Often with theese hard to come by, hyped albums of the golden era, there is a reason why it didn't get the recognition it deserved. Here it just doesn't make any sense. This album has got some of the illest beats Beatnuts ever handed to a rapper, we got Mf Grimm up in here, we got Casual up in here, we even got the stimulated Dummies blessing this record with a couple(?) of gems. Not to meantion Kurious him self, humorious, laid back and on the humble tip.This is a very solid record(that acctualy is a 4.5 rather than a 4.0) that i would recomend to all you die hard earlyninetieshiphop fans who think you covered the golden era with your gangstarr foundation, ditc & native tounges. This one is just as good, don't sleep!(...)"
5,A Day in the life of....,Best album in recent years and this album is 10 years old...I used to have it on cassette put I pretty much played it to ashes and for the last 7 years ive been searching for it on the web and I finally found here...thanx Amazon
4,"spell it wit a ""J""","This album brings back great memories of the summer of 94. Some times it's refreshing to dip in the old cd's and find a gem like Kurious. In a time where hip hop has turned to nothing more than garbage, I listen to this album and others from that era before hip hop was so processed. The beats are fresh, partly because of excellent production from the Beatnuts. After this album i never heard anything new from Kurious, i'm sure because album sales weren't as great as expected. And if Kurious was to come out with new material he would have to appeal to the masses and come wack like all the others who attempted comebacks recently. but we will always have the ""constipated monkey"" a hip hop classic!!"
2,VERY TINY,I had read all the reviews of this item so I new it was small. I wasn't prepared for how very tiny. I have three grandkids and get each books for Christmas...this will be a stocking stuffer for my grandson. The price is rather high for the size of the books!
3,okay product,"My 1-year-old daughter likes to play with the books as a toy, take them out and put them back. In terms of the content of the book, I think some of the stories are just weird."
2,nice books but small size not clear in description,"Nice library quality books but the small size of the books is not clear in the description. I thought I was getting a good deal at $17 for a hardcover box set of one of my favorite authors when I was a kid. The text is also quite small...I'm guessing 11 or 12 point.On the plus side, the books are compact enough to throw in my daughter's Dora backpack for traveling.Next time I'll definitely read the full description and all reviews before I buy anything online."
1,Wasn't expecting this.,"I wasn't expecting this set of books to be smaller than a deck of cards. Whoops, forgot to click several times and read the fine print saying they were 2"" x 3"". I returned them!!"
3,"Love the mini-size, but they were also mini-interesting for my girls","The tiny size of these books enchanted my two little girls, aged 5 and 3. The stories themselves, though, did not engage them, or me."
3,"""Miniature doesn't cut it""","When other people wrote very small in their reviews, I didn't understand how ABSOLUTELY MINIATURE these books were. They seem more like 2"" X 2""!!Very hard to read with the children. Partly, because they want to look at the pictures while I read and that's impossible! The stories are adorable and I totally recommend these books and anything this author has written!!! But, come on!!!! This tiny version should have been made so that the reader can see the words. I have 20/20 vision and I know my vision isn't the problem!!"
3,Watch out for Alligators!,"This boxed set contains four books written by Maurice Sendark: Alligators All Around, Chicken Soup with Rice, One Was Johnny, and Pierre. Maurice Sendak is probably best known for ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" even though the Little Bear books also are exceptionally well written and illustrated. Without doubt ""Where the Wild Things Are"" and all of the ""Little Bear"" books are better than books in the collection, hence my rating of 3 stars. While I liked the books and my kids did too (somewhat), the books lack the pizzazz and fun of Maurice's other books."
3,Books are so tiny,These books are good but so tiny. Did not realize they were so small when I ordered.
5,Pierre et al,"Heres a great little set of books for small children, I have a set from when I was small and my 5 year old son has been captivated by the whole series as well..... especially Pierre and he has chosen this for his class reading competition!! They are great books, easy to hold for little fingers and span the range from 0 - 7 years, the set I purchased was for a friends baby."
4,Really small books...but we read them every day,This is a user error on my part because I never looked at the book size...about as big as a pack of cards. I was expecting an 8x10 kids book. My two year old is in love with the whole series and steals my phone so she can listen to the songs when the books are lost...which happens beacuse they are small.
5,My niece loves them!,"I had this set myself when I was a little girl and I lOVED them. I kept mine all through growing up, so when i saw these I had to buy them for my 4yr old niece. They are small so dont be surprised but just right for little hands. She LOVES them! She packs them in her backpack so she can have ""something to do when im bored"" how cute is that! she would rather read this little books than push buttons on that DS! that alone is worth the price."
1,Too Too Small,"Although Mr. Sendak's books are wonderful, This collection, the Nutshell Library is totally impractical. The books are so small that they are disappointing. I bought the books for my 2 year old grandson and they are of no use because of the size. It would be helpful, if in describing the collection, the size of the books were mentioned."
5,Lovely Little Library,"This little library is one of my treasured possessions. It is beautiful and charming. My kids choose it often as a bed time book. I have had to hide it because they want to play with it and I don't want it to be ruined. They know most of the words to the rhymes, and can sing along to the Really Rosie sound track. These are some essential stories for Maurice Sendak fans."
3,Please note just how small this is,"Even though I knew this would be small, the actual size of it is quite shocking in person :) I know my daughter will love it though. I might need a magnifying glass to read it to her!"
5,One of my childrens' favorite,I bought this for my daughter 8 years ago. She loved it. I just bought another set for my 3 year old son because that is all he wants to read. He loves the tiny size of the books. I agree--Maurice Sendak is awesome!
3,FYI: The Nutshell Library is actually the size of a nutshell.,"Fantastic books--I have always loved them. However, I was somewhat unprepared to see how tiny this collection was. I didn't think they meant 'nutshell' literally in terms of sizing. I guess I need to go look for a larger edition of the books, as the size made it impossible for me to read them to my kiddo. This edition would probably be best for somewhat older children or as a collector's item."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this game for Christmas, and it is really boring. Once you finish your barrel racing competition, you can't compete anymore. Then you ride in the pasture, and you knock down a barrel you have to start all over again. That is extremely frustrating when you reach the last level when there is about 8 billion barrels to go around.And when you feed the horses ( only apples and carrots) it just sort of... disapears. Also, when your person is standing, she shuffles around like she has to pee. Anyway, you can only have one horse, and you can't rename it. Donot waste your money on this."
3,boring,got last christmas. fun at first but now it is pretty boring. get it if your looking for a game you can master in one minute!
1,Terrible,"My 10 yr old daughter played it for 30 minutes and said she didn't like it, and hasn't played it since."
1,Is That it??,YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ON THIS GAME!THE HORSE IS BAD LOOKING! IT IS EASY!YOU CAN OOOOOOOOOOOONLY BARREL RACE! BOORRING!!!YOU CAN ONLY FEED YOUR HORSE APPLES AND CARROTS!YOU CAN ONLY BRUSH IT!BORING!!!YOU CAN'T BRING IT TO ITS STALL OR PASTURE!ALL YOU CAN DO IS BARREL RACE.YOU CAN'T RIDE IT ON TRAILS!!BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING!
3,I really expected more !A kids reveiw!,"The game is okay. When I got it, for my b-day I expected a little more. Here are all of the things you can do in the WHOLE GAME!1.Pick your persons hair,shirt,boots, and name. :(2.Pick your horses mane,name,color, and groom and feed(if u want.)3.Competition4.Pasture5.PracticeThat may seem like alot but, it's not. And finally you can't even walk around the barn walk in a feed room work up to get other horses tack up your horse take it out of its stall it will never get dirty. It never needs to eat [...]It is sorta cool 'cause you really don't ever see western games, but it isn't that fun. I wish I would have got more of that game! Tina V. Age 9 Kids reveiw"
5,A GREAT GAME,"In this game you can pick the rider's clothes, and you can pick the color of the horse's coat and mane. You have three choices of places to ride. In practice mode you can practice for the barrel racing competitions. In pasture mode you can try some timed barrel racing challenges. In competition mode you can try the barrel racing contests. You have to use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the rider,but it is easy once you get used to it.Overall this game is super fun! :)"
5,This game is so fun to play,I love this game because you get to barrel race that is so fun. I finshed all of the pasture games and now I am doing them again. I think I would like to collect all of the Let's Ride PC games!
1,"It's okay, but there are so many other better games...","I beat this game in one hour. You don't take care of your horse. There is no plotline, you just ride in the competition or the practice ring. This might be great for a younger fan or novice equestrian, but of the games I have played, Saddle Up: Time To Ride and Saddle Up with Pippa Funnell are the best riding games out there."
2,DISAPOINTING,IT WAS VERY DISAPOINTING. IT HAD SO MANY GLICHES AND THE HORSE COLORES WHERE NOT VERY EXITING.IT WAS REALLY EASY I PASSED IT SO FAST.
1,IT IS TOO SHORT,"I loved this game for 5 minutes or so, then I felt like I wasted $20.00! What a rip-off! This games stinks! DON'T BUY IT! (at least this version of the game) GRRRRRRRRRRRRR P.S. I'm 14."
3,eh not that bad,"Ok this game is fun for the first 10 min.But all you can do are like 4 patterns and a competition you cant even ride it in a free mode!When i saw the horse i said cool but all you can do is feed it a carrot and apple,SO EXICTING!not.. dont waste your money DO NOT LISTEN DOOO NOOOT BUY THIS GAME. ps i hoped i healped you .i usually like all horse games!"
2,Not enough,The game doesn't have enough to do all you do is barrel race. It's not much fun. And you can't even take care of your horse enough to make it count. I just got the game and I am finished with the barrel racing season already.
1,thats it...?!,"I beat this game in literally 15 minutes. what a waste of money. you can either practice, do pasture games, or competitions. I beat the game really fast and its not worth spending money on. i'm not impressed."
2,Okayish,"I bought this game a few years ago... It was better a few years ago.This game would probably be great for younger girls. Basically you run the horse around the barrel, no skill involved. The pattern for the competitions never change, just barrel pattern. Although in the practice pen you can go through multiple courses such as the pole pattern (Still with barrels) etc. For the older girls (Over 12) I would recommend the Legacy of Rosemond Hill. It includes jumping, cross country, and steeple chase. With an additional story line (Almost a mystery) added. In addition, you have the option of owning three horses total as you place (Or win) in the various competitions. More challenge=more fun."
1,borrrrrringgggg!,"I bought this game because i LOVE horse games, and thought this game was going to keep me busy for an hour or so. Boy was i wrong! ALL you do is run around barrels!I played this game for 20 minutes, hoping something exciting would happen when i finished the competions, but nothing happened whatsover! If you don't want to be bored to tears, don't buy this garbage that mocks the Let's Ride series!"
2,Take my advice!!!,first of all you don't actually take care of your horse all you can do with it is feed it a carrot or apple and change it's saddle pad and saddle. and i beat the game in like 45 minutes practicing is reeeeeeaaally boring after like twice. you can basically finish the game in like a one hour sitting. dont buy this game and save yourself 20.00
3,"Not the best, but still okay","This game is the only Western one I've seen, and it's pretty good when you start it. It doesn't take much time to finish, though, and you just race around barrels (which actually is a real-life riding game). In the championships, the three barrels are always in the same place. The pasture riding has more to do. The main challenge is making the tight turns and getting to the finish line before the time runs out. The horses look much like ponies, and they don't need any care at all. You can brush or feed them apples or carrots if you want. The scrapbook didn't work very well, but you should go to ValuSoft.com if this happens or you have any other problems. Once you get used to this game, it's really easy. Overall it's good, but don't buy it for more than $10. The Saddle Up games are harder, but they're a whole lot better."
3,Pretty fun but to short!!!,This game is fun but way to short. I won all the competitions in like 5 minutes. The pasture part is okay but all you ever do is run around barrels. The stable is really boring. There is only three types of saddles and really ugly pads! The types of horses are okay. It is really easy to win. It is getting to be boring!!!
3,Not the Best One Out There,"This game was an impulse buy for me, being a horse lover. I beat it (all of it, from the actual competition to the pasture mode) in maybe... an hour, at most. This game also has little to no replay value. You beat it the first time, and, well, you beat it. Also, there's no horse care at all and the horse and rider look... odd. Also, you can only barrel race and do the pasture stuff... I was really expecting a lot more, especially from a Let's Ride! title, which are usually very good. Unless this is what interests you, I wouldn't really recommend it."
3,fun but also not,i didn't expect this bad of a game. all you do is ride and choose cloths for you person and pick a color for your horse. i'm a horse lover but i beat this game in 20 minutes tops! great for younger kids though . i gave it to my nieghbor caity and she loves it to death. when i babysitter her she always wants to play this game it's hard to not convince to play it!
2,Not recomended for older kids,"This game is a better game for younger kids, It was very boring and Unrealistic 2 me. I don't think that this game was very fun at all."
4,good,I bougtht it because i needed some songs which werenot available on other cds i.e. See No Evil - Capleton. I loved the beat this song is on and this cd had them all in one place.
5,A great read,"This is a thriller that leaves you with good feelings. A young Greek American commits the almost perfect crime, leading to many trials, adventures, the discovery of his heritage and ethnicity, steamy sex, and a very satisfying conclusion. The portrait of Greek village life is very warm and sympathetic (in contrast to Kazantzakis'). The dialogue is perfect.I look forward to the movie. I might even look up the author's scholarly work."
4,Great effort by the Brothers Walker and the Cook.,"The new line up of Gravitar after the departure of Harold is much improved. Special guest appearences from the Southeast Michigan area. With a main power of drums, guitar and microphone tar, this is a must buy for those who like the acid noise scene. Just imagine the Butthole Surfers rammed through a jet propeller into the mouth of KK Null. Auditory overload never felt so good."
3,Look before you leap,"On the positive side, this DVD will certainly increase muscularity in ways that may allow one to be a better fencer. There is a significant amount of focus on strengthening and toning the legs, as well as agility work, that will keep your heart racing and likely make you sore after the first few times you do it.On the negative side, this DVD rushes the participant into a very intense work out that you may not necessarily be ready to do. Many stretches and some exercises can only be performed after significant training, such as doing a split.Some portions also require you to have a fencing foil, so be forewarned that full use of this DVD requires a foil and a hanging target.In short, it is a useful DVD, if you are physically capable of keeping up with someone who has about 15 years of fencing training and practice. I recommend this DVD for those who seriously want to fence- as well as a yoga routine and strength training prior to your use of this DVD!"
4,Light healthy fare,"If you're expecting Fatih Akin as the serious master ""The Edge of Heaven"" and ""Head-on"", you won't find him here. ""Soul Kitchen"" is a nifty little comedy, set in a seedy restaurant in the seedy bohemian Wilhemsburg district of Hamburg. Owner Zinos, a young Greek German whose back is out for most of the story and whose girlfriend is off in China, makes junk food that his puffy longtime customers down with beer. Everything changes, though, in the throes of neighborhood gentrification. Everything. Running a restaurant is a thinly-veiled allegory for filmmaking--whether you give people the junk they want, or make fabulous food and find/cultivate an audience to love it. There's a great love of humanity here."
3,"FATIH AKIN, OPUS 9","As we all know it, food is federative. In American movies, like in Stanley Tucci'sBig Nightfor instance, culinary delights serve more as a way to abolish social classes differences or to fulfill the ever vivacious American dream. But Fatih Akin is a German, of Turkish parentage, living in Europe so he uses this theme differently and emphasizes the power of food in the fight against racism or xenophobia. Isn't the Greek Zinos' backache finally cured by a Turkish (Greece and Turkey still have a big problem to solve) physical therapist ? Enjoyable."
1,Worst version of these wonderful classic stories!,"I've just got a few DVDs from this Brothers Grimm Double Feature series from Amazon hoping for some nice animation on these classics.Well, it doesn't happen too often to just stop a movie beacuse it's so bad but this time I was really mad at these Holywood-like violent distortions!I thought they will be something like Mikhail Baryshnikov's Stories from My Childhood but there's nothing like that! These have such a nice animation for wonderful classic stories ..."
4,My Favorite Monsters Are Back Again,"It's not often I get to read a book with all my favorite monsters: Vampires, werewolves, ghouls, zombies, Immortals, and an obnoxious cat, to name a few. It's even less often that I catch myself laughing through that same book. There is a wonderful mixture or horror and humor here that appeals to me and keeps me turning the pages. There is also a romance that is just heating up and I hope continues to in the next book. I don't want to rush the authors or put any pressure on them but when is the next book coming out!!!! I'm waiting! ;)"
1,THE TOY CAME RIPPED!!!,"Highly dissapointed with the website, the toy came with a rip on its shoulder and my daughter was very upset. Never EVER buying from these people again. Very disappointing."
4,DK Plush,This was purchased for my 8 year old son. He loves to play with Donkey Kong with the other characters from Mario Brothers. Good quality.
2,Disappointed,"I believe I over paid for this product. It didn't come with any tags. I received it with all tags and labels cut off. Didn't seem to be authetic. It looked used, but should have been new. My son loves it still. He said Dk's eyes looked scary and different. I don't think I got what I paid for. The Material, it was made from, felt cheap. It wasn't very plush like the other nintendo charactors my son has."
4,Good quality and size.,My kids love it and play with all the time. Soft and of good quality! More pricy if you buy it locally..
5,Perfect!,My son loves Mario so we decided to get him all the dolls in the set for him. He has a couple and absolutely loves playing with them. They are made of an excellent quality material and will hold up to some good heavy play. I highly recommend them!
3,Cute Toy for the Super Mario Fan,Nice soft plush and it seems durable enough. Will be a nice addition my kids collection. It is so hard to find these in the stores these days.
3,Disappointing...not as good as the RG to Classic Novels,"I read this book after reading and greatly enjoying the ""Rough Guide to Classic Novels"". ""Cult Fiction"" is quite disappointing compared to that book because it focuses on the authors themselves instead of the books. The book covers far too many authors so the bios are too brief to be informative. It also cites some of their most important works, but again, there's no meat. Skip this one and read ""Classic Novels"" instead."
3,SLR with active screen,purchased a couple years ago. Love the active screen with SLR. I purchased the kit with 2 lenses. I'm a point and shoot kinda photographer so this was my first SLR. Light levels appear to be darker than friends Nikkon with standard lense. Also need to upgrade lens to be able to blur out backgrounds. I'm more into portability so use my pocket camera most of the time.
5,spindle sander,"do not know how I could have worked in my wood shop for so many years without this sander, it is extremly well made and has a very large surface to work on..it is great !"
4,Very nice Sander,"I bought this Wilton (99179)Oscillating Spindle Sander on 09/28/08 and its been a great sander so far. The only issue I have with it, is when I pulled it out of the box the table top was peeling up a little bit. Taken care of with some glue though. I used it for a constant 1 1/2 hours the other day without shutting it off. Works Great, Didn't miss a beat!"
1,Broke within One Hour of Operation,"Bought this sander for home workshop. Very light use, just handy to have so I bought one. Didn't want to spend an arm and a leg to have a handy little gizmo. In less than one hour of operating time, poof! It will spin with the best of them, but the oscillating portion of the machine disappeared. Pretty much eliminates the allure of an oscillating sander.Learned my lesson. Save up and buy a quality machine. I've sent an inquiry in to Wilton warranty folks. We'll see what develops. The Amazon return window closed per rules, and that's ok. But I bought it in August 2008 and I personally think even a cheap sander should work for at least a few months instead of the 4 months I've had it.Anyway, no more Wilton products, I'll work out something to buy their high end products, Jet. I have a great appreciation of Jet and their customer service."
5,Cheap and good.,"For light use, it is a great deal. It does the job and has all the basic elements of a good spindle sander. You can install an external rheostat to regulate speed. I recommended it to several friends who bought it, and they all liked it."
4,Great program,"This program brings Sun Tzu's well-known concepts to life, with practical examples from the past 50 years. While it is a bit dated, it is nevertheless current considering that Sun Tzu wrote ""The Art of War"" over 2,500 years ago. Well worth the investment of one hour and a few dollars. A must see for anyone interested in military and business strategy, including espionage."
4,Easy remote access,"We bought this product from Amazon to use with the Radio Shack unit we've had for several yrs. They no longer carry this at Radio Shack. We haven't been able to coordinate the two systems to work together. Otherwise, it's great! We have our outdoor fountain, patio lights and one set of indoor lamps attached."
5,the Real Thing!,"This is an excellent resource if you are serious about learning THE REAL THING. Mr. Aviram teaches the Original and Authentic IDF Krav Maga, and not the overly commercial version of it.It is stands as an invaluable resource of information directly from one of the techniques most well known masters.While this is not a flashy DVD production, but it's about the quality of the actual teaching that you get here - so if you want to actually learn the real thing, then this DVD is for you.I also own the book, and I strongly suggest to practice in combination of the DVD and his book.Like any other mastering - you need to take the time, practice, go back to the DVD, go back to read the book etc. these two (dvd+book) work together to give you the full understanding of what the real (PURE) Krav-Maga really is."
5,Spice Rack,"""Born Again"", ""Happiness"", etc. All of his albums are a hit. A little bit of gospel and lovers rock mix together. Smooth, silky voice. Great guality music. Great gifts. I am putting these albums on my Christmas shopping list. Yes indeed, another great Jamaican that I am proud of along with Beres Hammond. I would recommend these albums to everyone. May Mickey Spice continue to put out good quality music.Sincerely,Love quality music"
3,Interesting but left me with wanting more...,"Mystics, Masters, Saints, and Sages: Stories of Enlightenmentwas filled with interesting stories that provided a a good overview about some enlightened beings who found truth and meaning. However, the book left me with wanting more.As a collection of personal writings and stories it was certainly interesting. However, it was lacking the inspiration to practice and the guidance it promised it would contain and provide for one's own journey.Christine Maingard, Author of 'Think Less Be More:Mental Detox for Everyone'"
5,Not Much Better Than This,"Jim Suhler is good but Alan Haynes is great!... Check out the Red Guitar he has, it was Stevie Ray's on the Albert King Record- IN Sessions. Alan has been playing since he was 8 years old and is tremendous. Buy this CD and go check him out at Joe's Generic Bar on 6th Street in Austin (every tuesday night!). He will rock your world!!"
2,DIDNT PLAY AT ALL!,Buyers i would recommend getting the newest one possible...I had buyed it and it has good fast shipping i am a big fan of Naruto....I give the naruto anime 5 stars and this disc 1 star in total of 2 stars.....
4,Good Lesium New Age Music,"Mixture of Lesiem and vocalists including Andrea Schwarzbach. Latin,nice melodies, and Gregorian chants. Adds nicely to my Lesium collection and other New Age selections such as Enigma and Celtic music."
1,Just not worth it.,"Yes, it sounds a little like Enigma. Like a hometown wannabe cover band. There's no depth to the sound, as if they didn't have the studio time or talent or money, and the vocals seem harsh and out of place instead of fusing with the music. Give this a pass. If you like this sort of sound, another group is Angel Tears and they seem much better."
2,I expected much more,This report had only the most basic information. I had expected something much more in-depth from Harvard Biz School.
5,A atmospheric and interesting series,I'm in the middle of second of this series. I was especially drawn in by the vivid descriptions of Africa and the independent and spunky lead character. Jazz Jasper is an expatriate American trying to launch a tour business in Africa. A friend helps her to land a tour for an advertising firm scouting locations for a commercial campaign. A cast of assorted characters set out on their journey. Murder ensues. There is a nice Law and Order type twist at the end.
1,Trash,"Well, I think that this book is simply terrible. The plot is overdone and completely, completely too cheesy. There is almost no character development. In fact, as I was reading this I didn't care at all about what was going to happen to the characters. This is a shallow, superficial book that all people-- girls, (boys?), teens, everyone--should steer clear of."
2,Worth Avoiding,"In the past couple of years, the world of young adult literature has been able to move past the desperate cliches of boy/girl dating and into a place where characters' thoughts, feelings, and comments about the opposite sex are realistic, albeit awkward and somewhat comical. This book, however, throws us back a few decades. Yes, I realize that it's intended to be easy-going and fun, but it decends to the point of being surface and stereotypical. The characters talk like two highschoolers out of the eighties, more Valley Girl than today's teens would ever be. And their stereotypical eccentric shop-owner friend reminds us of so many other characters--see any John Hughes teen movie. Admittedly, there are some funny moments as the girls set out to get dates by transforming pet rats into real boys. But the whole theme of ""the unpopular girl against the popular girl"" ends up making the characters seem ridiculous and shallow."
2,Disappointing audio book tie-in version of a good movie,"I have watched the movie several times and enjoy it. But Mare Winningham's narration of this book is disappointing, to say the least. She reads much too fast, does not enunciate and there is little or no modulation or inflection. It's as if she is reading a very dry speech or a term paper. The audio quality is also bad, too low to really hear and understand, complicated again by the too-fast reading of the narrative. It is listed as ""abridged,"" but I cannot find a novellization or a full-version of it anywhere. Would have enjoyed reading the book or a good quality audiobook to get some in-depth understanding of the whole situation. I am an avid audiobook fan, as well as written word, but this one comes up lacking. Save your money. Rent or buy the movie, with subtitles turned on - it adds volumes to Jodie Foster's and Liam Neeson's and Natasha Richardson's performances."
1,The worst amateurish production EVER,"If you're looking to waste some money in today's economy do I have a DVD set for you. This DVD set promises to teach 'SENSUAL MASSAGE', these videos are pretty much documenting how to give a basic 'RUB DOWN'... I learned ABSOLUTELY nothing new. The white robes worn by the ""actors"" were extremely distracting. The whole set-up from the environment to cheap discount bedding was a disappointment. Save your money."
1,Not what it advertises to be,"This DVD is not what it advertises to be. It's a basic massage video, nothing sensual about it. And even the instruction on the basic massage is lacking - they just show a couple massaging each other but don't explain the technique at all.The voiceover ""instructions"" rarely match what's actually happening on screen and is full of terribly corny ""tips"" like one that recommended buying a terry cloth robe from a local department store to add to the home spa feel. Please.I wouldn't recommend this video and feel like I completely wasted my money."
5,Helped us spark up relationship....,"After being married for 7 years we needed a way to reconnect. This video did it. It was just like they said... a romantic escape. It helped us find a deeper connection and my husband was estatic when he received it as a gift. It's true, a little spice (which we found in this video) made a world of difference."
5,The Sensual Massage Kit,"This movie was quickly shipped, and very good. I was a little hesitant at first to buy a movie like this. I was afraid of it just being another inappropriate film on the market. But, it wasn't. I feel this film was tastefully done and it has my positive vote. I actually learned something from this movie. My husband enjoyed it too."
5,King Deluxe 10inch Mem Foam Mattress,"Am I glad I decided on purchasing this instead of going all out on the Temper-Pedic. Already notice I am sleeping right thru the nite without anymore tossing and turning trying to find comfortable spots. We let it air out for two nites and no problems with any smell. This is a great purchase for the price. As many others have said, don't waste the extra $[...]bucks on a TP. This is just as good."
1,Not 5lb density. only 3lb,"The memory foam on this mattress is stated to be 5lb density, however it is not. We un-zipped the cover and removed the top 3"" memory foam layer and weighed it on our digital scale. It weighed in at 24 lbs.The memory foam layer is 60x80x3, or 8.33 cubic feet. This means it is 3lb density.Amazon has been great and worked with me to return the mattress."
5,great mattress,"We have had this mattress for awhile. It sleeps great. Read other reviews and they went both ways. Yes there's an odor when you first get it, nothing horrendous and it goes away within a few days (2) If you are used to conventional mattress and box springs be prepared for q few nights of getting used to. That being said, great product for the money, free delivery a plus. A little awkward to carry, but unwraps and expands quickly. Great company, no complaints, arrived when promised."
5,Dynasty Mattress,Mattress was received compressed in a double layer plastic bag. Once opened it only took a couple hours to expand to full size. The mattress is very comfortable but took a few days for my back to get used to the change. Now I wounder why I took so long to purchase a memory foam mattress. There is an odor with this mattress when first opened and took about a week for it to dissipate.
4,Good,"Good. But, stinky. Aired it out for a week in another room, now sleeping on it, but there's still toxic off-gassing. Will check back in a month and report long-term comfort and smelliness."
4,Good value,"I have had this mattress for a little over 2 months and am very happy with itSo far I have no complaints. I went from a water bed to this and it took a while to get used to because it is very firm, but now I can't imagine being without it. It does take a few days for the smell of the foam to disappear but was never unbearable. For the money I don't think you could go wrong.It is quite heavy as delivered and vaccuum packed so make sure you have in the room you want it in before you cut the straps and take off the plastic wraping.Read the Warranty information carefully it can be a bit misleading from what I can see there really is not much of any warranty so if it looks like it may have been damaged in shipping send it back immediatly before you open it or it could be costly for you to ship it back. READ the warranty carefully ALONG with their return policy.I have had no problem with my mattress and would recommend it."
1,HORRIBLE back pain. Avoid cheap foam like a plague!,"I have no idea how this product got so many positive reviews. After first night I wanted to return it but I decided to give it a chance. What a wrong decision - another week of terrible back pain! I normally have no back issues so it was clearly attributable to this mattress. I also have no idea why some people describe it is ""firm"" - it is softer than a whipped cream. The moment you are on it you sink down, your back becomes an arc and next morning it feels like you were hit with a baseball bat.Now I don't know about more expensive quality stuff like Tempurpedic, but since my back is not a guinea pig I decided not to experiment more and got a spring mattress - next day my back pain was gone."
3,"Good, but not great.","Mattress arrived exactly as expected. Was fully expanded and chemical smell was gone after a couple hours. Comfortable at first, but if you like laying on your side when you sleep, go with the 12"" king with 5"" of memory foam (or more). This 10' is purely for back-sleepers. Sleeping on your side results in crazy shoulder and hip pressure points and dead-arms and you end up rolling around trying to get comfortable. Also, sleeping on your back with NO pillows or very thin pillows is the best way to go. If you have big fluffy pillows, you'll be fighting it all night because your head will sit way higher than your neck and shoulders.Overall, this is a good deal for the money, but don't be afraid of getting too much memory foam. 3 inches just isn't enough."
5,What a pleasant surprise!,"After researching data concerning the do's, don'ts, cost and potential rewards of these memory foam matresses for my wife (the nurse with the forever sore back) who I love to keep happy, I decided to try this matress. Wow is all I can say! Everything good that I read has so far occured. It was delivered within 3 days, hardly had any odor at all and after 10 hours was within 1/2 in. of it's full 10 inch thickness. We do not find it hot as some do but maybe that's just our chemistry and we slept on it the night that it was delivered after about 10 hours of it stretched out on the boxsprings. Nice nights sleep! Not spectacular (yet), but definitely much better. It's a fun bed too. For the money, I don't see how you can beat it. That is, of course assuming it will still be in good shape in 10 years. But for now, one of my ""Thumbs Up"" good buys...."
5,Excellent,"Japanese noise,ambient,psychedelic,and more! This CD covers the underground music of Japan. A must for serious music collectors !"
3,good story,Holland is charged to solve the mystery of a woman gone missing and who's presumed dead. The only evidence that he has is a tape with the victim describing the madness that is her life and sending out a plea for help. The book lets us get to know the victim through the words of those who knew her best. It all wraps up in a pretty good surprise ending that I certainly did not see coming.I don't know why David Housewright stopped writing this series. His lead character is so much more interesting than McKenzie.
1,Don't bother if you use VISTA,"This product may work very well for OS other than VISTA, but it sure doesn't work on VISTA. To their credit, they issued a complete refund, including shipping."
5,Nice heavy band,"Stunning band, heavy and solid. True to size. If you like a ring that shines, this is one of the best."
1,A cinematic root canal.,"Was this movie made so that they could release it directly to the bin at the back of a dollar store?If so, the producers have miscalculated. I don't think this DVD is worth that much.Badly written, a concept dreadful beyond description -- just bad. My heart goes out to the actors, who might have needed the money."
3,"Not a great movie, but it DOES have Jessica Alba for a save","The movie is a lot of sexy fluff. It's filled with gross-out humor, Dane Cook's AWFUL acting, and some incredibly beautiful women lead by one of our planet's most attractive females, Ms. Alba. I've read on here that a few of you don't consider Jessica Alba to be much of an actress, well to be sure she is no Meryl Streep but, the woman has real talent. I find that she steals most any scene in which we are lucky enough to see her.As for Mr. Cook, I find him to be of the ""Jerry Seinfeld School of Acting"". He needs a few more years of acting classes in a REAL school and a ton or two of the talent he is now so obviously lacking.The movie is OK, for guys who enjoy looking at very attractive women without their clothes for much of the flick. For the women, Mr. Cook supplies the eye candy and, the plot is a sweet ""chick flick"" like experience that makes this movie one which should be fun for both genders."
5,We loved it!,"Alot of you need a sense of humor!My boyfriend and I watched this and thought it was hilarious! We ended up watching it back to back, and rented it while some friends were up visiting us.Of course there were some unrealistic parts and thing that were weird. But, it is a MOVIE. I highly recommend this to anyone who has a sense of humor, and can enjoy a little bit of raunchiness in the meantime ;)"
3,Entertaining,It's a decent movie to watch if you are just looking for something entertaining. Guys this movie is filled with great looking women starting with Jessica.
1,Was this a comedy?,"I don't understand the point of Jessica Alba being clumsy and by the end of the movie she wasn't clumsy anymore anyway. The whole movie she acted cute and smiled and that was about it. They could have gotten any actress to play her part, as it required no talent.An old lady being hit with a frisbee is just not funny. Maybe if she fell off a cliff after being hit it would be. We have the stereotypical male, obsessed with breasts in this movie, and it gets annoying aftera while.The best part of the movie was the end credits where Dane made out with a penguin stuffed animal.Have fun with this one, but don't expect to laugh that much."
1,"I thought I hated Dane Cook before I saw this movie, but...","Apperently he sinks to a new low. I just don't get how anyone finds him funny whatsoever. He can butcher the best script ever written, and Good Luck Chuck was far from that. Absolutely no laughs to be had from this terrible excuse for a movie. I can't believe Jessica Alba would have wasted her time with this junk. I hope she stays away from trash like this in the future."
1,Terrible,"Acting was miserable, story was weak at best. The girls were pretty, but that's about the best I can say. One of the worst $2 I've spent in a while."
1,An Hour and A Half I Will Never Redeem,"Terrible storyline, terrible acting. The characters were not even likeable. I wish I could forget this movie and erase the horrible memory of it."
1,Bad Description,"The description says ""women inevitably find their soul mate right after dating him."" Should say ""women inevitably find their soul mate after screwing him."" Terrible movie, probably only has people that like it for the excessive and unnecessary sex scenes. More sex than actual content to the movie. Bad acting, not funny. Just plain bad."
3,An okay movie if...,"Jessica Alba wasn't the love interest!Cameron Diaz would have been a much better pick!Other than that, I thought the movie wasn't bad."
1,Altogether bad,We purchased this for a present which was requested by our teenage grandchild. We decided to review it prior to giving it to her. Fortunately the DVD was defective so we were telling her the truth when we said we had to throw it away. The little bit we saw was offensive and crude.
1,All the funny scenes have already been shown in the trailers!,"After watching the whole movie, I realized all the funny scenes have already been shown in the trailers! Jessica is sexy but most of the time, she's not funny at all.It's Bad Luck Chuck!"
1,Awful film,"I'd give it less than a one star rating if I had that option. It was stupid, gross, hated everything about it. Just seemed to me as the movie was built around the juvenile idea of showing a man getting laid as many times as possible while showing as much T&A as possible. There was nothing romantic or even funny about this movie. Dane Cook is not an actor I will ever watch again but Jessica Alba was adorable in this horrible film and I am going to hunt out something else with her in it. I don't know if it makes a difference? But I saw the unrated version."
3,Funny Movie,"One of the funnier Dane Cook flicks. He plays a likeable character who thinks he is cursed to always be the ""one before THE one."" Jessica Alba is the first girl he really falls for and is afraid to sleep with her because he thinks he will then lose her. Some really funny moments but I will caution you that there is some very graphic sexual content that is not appropriate for underage eyes."
2,Not great,"I honestly don't know what they were trying for. A romantic comedy maybe, but they fell far short of the mark. The only reason anyone would see this is for jessica Alba, but don't bother. Her part was so far less then what she is capable of."
3,"Ms. Alba was, as always HOT","I got this for the pleasure of viewing Jessica Alba, and that was about all I got from this one. I simply don't care for Dane Cook (he's not funny!!!!) but if your looking for a regular romantic comedy with a dash of smokin' Hot Jessica Alba thrown in, then this is the flick for you"
3,Good Luck Chuck DVD adultX,"This movie is X Porm. Not for family, Funny, but should be titled as what it is. I would have not purchased it if I would have known what was A X-rated movie."
2,IN LOVE WITH JESSICA,"I got this as a result of a buy 2 get 1 free. It is a good movie and funny as well. Nothing bad about the movie, I just prefer nature flicks."
3,Meh,"While I love Dane Cook and the fat guy with all the tasteless jokes, this movie kind of missed it for me.Seems like they were trying to add Dane to the cast to make it a funnier movie than it would have been with any other actor. There's no Oscar buzz over GLC for a reason.Having said that, it's a great ""chick flick"" that guys can suffer through thanks to the addition of Jessica Alba. It does have it's funny points but it's akin to Old School. Just another movie with lewd jokes and plot with a few great one liners thrown in"
1,just plain bad,don't waste your time. this film is a mis-fire in every way. it's just plain bad. i feel bad for everyone involved in this dud of a film.
1,Can I give it less than one star???,I guess I can give it at least one star. There were a couple of humorous parts but for the most part this moved sucked badly. The plot was really awful and the way they went about the movie was distasteful. I'm really annoyed that I spent money to rent this. Had I paid to see it in the theaters I would have demanded my money back!
3,Alright movie,"The only thing that i thought was funny was the acting skill of Dan Fogler. That dude is hilarious. Dane Cook is suppose to be this great comedian, but i didn't find him funny at all, he was more annoying than anything else. Jessica Alba is alright but i just didn't see the chemistry there. This movie is good for one viewing and its easily forgettable, except for the scenes with Dan Fogler, like i said that dude is funny and those are the scenes i remember most about the movie."
4,"Embarassing to Admit: It IS Funny, LOL Funny...","the movie as far as the plot goes leaves the viewer to make-up their own mind if Chuck was really under a curse or just displaying the power of self-fullfilling, people take me as quite conservative, yet another movie that would qualify in this category is ""Kingpin"". I saw a youtube clip of ""Good Luck Chuck"" and knew I had to see the movie, because it was so hilarious and before anyone tells me it's incorrect to find fat funny, I've lived both sides of the coin and each are funny in certain aspects.I would say Alba was a bit too young for the role and their relationship was a bit farfetched, but the point of the movie is it's all farfetched, just like his best friend envying his ''abilities'' with women. I certainly wouldn't let a kid see this movie, otherwise, if you like the best of SNL comedy, you'll probably laugh at the entire movie."
2,Missed the mark,"This movie had lots of potential, but fell flat due to its stupid jokes and overwhelmingly needless sex scenes/innuendo. Some people may like this kind of storyline/humor, but I found it to be extremely lacking. Meh."
3,"Funny moments, but don't rush to see this one","I waited for this one to come to video. I do admit that Dane cook's last romantic comedy, employee of the month, was actually not bad, and so I figured this would be about the same. Well, this one is definitly more cured, and the unrated is for all the added sexual content. It has its funny moments, but is a bit cheesy and far fetched. But, worth renting, then make the descision to buy or not."
1,....an exercise in REALLY bad taste,"I give it one star because its the lowest you can go. If it were possible to give a negative rating I would. This film is marketed as a lighthearted romantic comedy to draw people in, but once there you realize you've been had. Im not prudish but it really burns me that they (whoever THEY are) must have known this would not make money at the box office if people were aware of how raunchy it was so they advertised it as romantic-comedy-date-movie-fare. You go in expecting something like a Drew Barrymore type flick and soon discover its more like softcore porn and boneheaded, not-funny humor. By then its too late to get back your money and the hour and 45 minutes of your life you just wasted. Sometimes suggestive humor is funny, but this is just crude, crude, crude, all the way through. How did they get Jessica Alba to be in this? Anyway, BE WARNED- its unwatchable. Spend your $15 bucks on dinner instead."
4,Good Luck Chuck,"What did you expect? The same people that hate this will laugh their butts off at ""The Nutty Professor"" with Eddie Murphy. Do you see some hypocrisy there or is it just me? I laughed at that movie too but then I don't stick my nose up at this one. Some people have no sense of humor when it comes to poking a little fun at something personal. I for one love a little bashing on everyone. That is what this movie is about and most comedies for that matter. A guy gets cursed because a girl overreacts and then he spends his first thirty plus years enjoying being with women but nothing serious. Meanwhile word gets around right after sleeping with him the woman will meet the man of her dreams. Anyone that can't see the humor of that has to much fiber in their diet. Good quality DVD with standard extras. Good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Shallow Hal"".CA Luster"
1,very weak,"this film was boring slow and never got off the ground. Superbad, knocked up and american pie all worked because of a assemble cast that better worked up those films. I don't get the hype over Dane Cook at all. he is vastly overrated to me and I don't find him particular funny. Jessica Alba is eye candy and nothing more. this film had a interesting story line and would have been interesting if the Late Great Wilt Chamberlin were still Alive to play the main character. then this film might have been somewhat believeable. it sure wasn't funny."
2,Not really very funny.,"the product was used in nearly new, but it kept skipping at the end of the dvd. I could not watch the last 10 minutes of the move. I gave the dvd away to my friend."
3,Lots of skin,How on earth they got Jessica Alba in this thing is beyond me. I am a guy and enjoyed the skin but feel Alba was the only thing that let this thing float just above the trash...barely.
3,Alright movie,"This was an alright movie, I was disapointed that I got the rated movie and it was still pretty vulgar compared to most rated DVD's. It is pretty much Dane Cook being Dane Cook"
3,"RAUNCHY, SILLY AND NOT AS BAD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE!","'Good Luck Chuck' got so much bad press I thought I would hate this movie, but it's not 'THAAAAT' bad...... around 2 1/2 stars....I had to give it 3 stars on the ratings board to even things out a bit. I like Dane Cook, but he has not proven himself as an actor yet. The cast is OK with lots of nude chicks, but it doesn't really pick up any steam until they get through all the usual sex jokes and start getting down to the love story which is all too brief and not all that satisfying. Allow me to clarify my last statement as I have raised a few eyebrows with it. I'm a guy, I like to look at nude chicks, but at some point in this film it became ridiculous and it was time to move on......maybe I just wanted to see Jessica Alba nude? :-D I've seen much worse, but I've seen much better. The DVD transfer is good and if you've seen everything else at the rental store, you might give this a look."
5,"OH, COME ON!!!","I've read such really bad reviews for this movie, and I don't get it. I'm very picky where comedy is concerned. To make me want to laugh out loud is very hard, and very few movies have achieved that. 50 first dates was one of them, some of the old Eddie Murphy and Jim Carrey movies, for instance. But this one was too funny, a little over the top, sexist, and blah blah blah but hey - it's not real life, so you don't have to take it seriously. I am a woman, and I found the movie to be very enjoyable for a saturday night with my BF. I guess to each their own, like for example I hated Seinfeld and everyone thinks that's the Crème of the Crème in comedy. Just view it, and judge for yourself."
3,Just OK,"I wanted this to be a really good movie, however, it was just okay. The acting wasn't all that great, although it was funny in some parts. Alba's brother and Cook's best friend were probably the funniest people in the movie. I don't know, maybe if it had other actors, it would have been better."
5,Great value great quality,We use this in the ofice. It is a snap to set up and easy to use. We use it with the visonic wireless base system. We also have fire alarms and door sensors. All work prefectly
1,Be Careful...,"Be careful when ordering this item, I ordered a Set to fit a 2006 F150 6.5ft Bed, the set I received was to fit an S-10/Dakota Crew Cab. Apparently Amazon doesn't truly check for fit on this type of item.As far as quality, these look like and excellent set of side rails, for those of you out there with S-10/Dakota Crew Cabs."
4,Acoustic Bossa Nova,"This is a stripped down bossa nova album. Gone are the electronics of Bebel Gilberto. Gone is the syrupy strings of Astrid Gilberto. Instead there is acoustic guitar, percussion, bass, and piano. Many of the songs are slow and intrcate (there is a Baden Powell cover here after all). It's a beautiful CD but lacks the innate catchiness to make it great. It's meant to be listened to quietly rather than blasted out of speakers of a dance club. All the ingrediants are here to be outstanding but Fonesca doesn't quite pull it off. Stand out tracks: Slow Motion Bossa Nova, The Night We Called it a Day, She's a Carioca, and Minha Dalva de Oliveira. If you like the Woman on Top soundtrack, you should like this."
4,A bit cheesy but much better than Slow Motion Bossa Nova,"Well... I like it. The arrangements are mellow and minimalist, (even if a bit cheesy, not half as cheesy and redundant as in Slow Motion...) I give this album four stars for two of its tracks - Sem Resposta, which is an incredibly beautiful ""voz e violao"" bossa, and She's a Carioca, a breezy and fresh rendition of Jobim's standard in duet with Cibelle. The rest is good, but not outstanding, similar to Bebel Gilberto's Tanto Tempo, but with a male vocal (not my type of male vocal though... Vinicius Cantuaria's voice pleases me more;)... I would describe this disk as very slick and soft, it will go well with candlelight and good wine."
2,LG phone below average,"I switched to Verizon from Sprint for many reasons. Most of all everyone I know was in the ""IN"" network. I was very disapointed with the selection of phones to choose from back in 2/05. I started out with a cute little Samsung picture phone but it flip broke and they moved me into ""this piece"". I absolutely hate the driving mode option! This stupid button is ALWAYS triggering into driving mode. VERY ANNOYING! Also the camera is not very good as far as color and clarity. And to top things off the phone is just plain ugly. I hope that Verizon is stepping up the variety and quality of there phone selection, because I felt like I was taking a step backward leaving Sprint."
1,"Bad service, poor design","There are few things I expect from my phone - reasonable service coverage (ie can I make and receive calls), and it needs remain in ""manner mode"" until I change the setting myself.This phone has problems in both areas. Ever since I upgraded in June of 2005, I have had more dropped calls and fewer received calls than the supposedly ""inferior"" older LG model I was using previously. In addition, the ""Driving Mode"" button on the side finds a way to activate itself while in your pocket (or purse, or wherever) at the most inconvenient times (like when you're in class, in a business meeting, etc.). So instead of quietly vibrating to notify you of an incoming call, it blurts out ""CALL FROM ......"" (fill in the ..... with the name of the person who is calling you).Battery life leaves you wanting another half hour at least.Additionally, the camera is poor even for the display on the phone itself, and even at the highest quality setting.There must be a better phone out there."
3,It was so so,"I had this phone for a week. Features drew me in. However, I just traded it in today for a VX 7000 and wow - I'm glad I did. I didn't like the small buttons, lens cover would slide down while in a pocket, camera side button would press in my pocket and I'd hear the phone taking pictures, garbly reception (I'm just outside NYC), quite a few dropped calls and the voice command was annoying (3 steps to make a call) and either I couldn't understand the repeat name to say yes or no to, or it couldn't find it. I gave up. The only thing I miss is the speaker phone. The 7000 is the same weight but it is slightly longer. I liked how it felt better in my hand and holding up to my ear. Unless you really want the speakerphone, I'd get something else."
4,"Good phone, few flaws","Overall this is a strong phone with many features you would find on any flip phone. It comes stocked with a camera with a 60 pic capacity, downloadable games, text/pic messaging and others. Negatives include the poor button design on the left side of the phone. This phone will transfer from ""manner mode"" (vibrate) to driving mode at inconvenient times in your pocket. This can not only be annoying, but also can be somewhat embarrassing in quiet situations. In addition, if the phone hasn't been turned off in a while and restarted, the text message feature will no longer work. Don't ask my why it just happens. It is an easy fix, turn off/turn back on, but is another annoying ""feature"" I didn't want to pay for.My rating: 7.5/10"
3,Not too bad,"I've had nokia, motorola and samsung phones (7-8 diff models) before I got this one and this is one of the better ones. (Samsung phones are just plain horrible). I've had it for almost a year and the sound quality has not diminished. You can get a lot of ring tones (for extra $) and they sound really nice. The speaker phone is a plus since I hate those ear bud things when I'm driving. The pictures come out nicely but there is a button on the side that activates the camera so I end up with pictures of my pocket quite often. ""Driving Mode"" is the worst - it too gets activated by a button on the side and if you have anything in your pocket besides the phone you end up in this mode and it is just plain offensive. If I could give 1/2 stars this would get a 3 1/2"
3,Bad reception but great features,"I used to use the LG VX4500 with verizon. I upgraded to the LG VX 6100 phone via amazon.com and have stuck with verizon.First, I loved the features the 4500 had and the same is true with the 6100. I figured it couldn't hurt to upgrade since the features would be the same and I would get the camera with the 6100.I've had the phone for about a week without any problems. Today I have had at least 7 dropped calls! It has been horrible. I know it's not my verizon service as I've had them for years. I know it's not my location because it's my house and I've lived here for 4 years.It's gotta be the phone! Boooooooo!If it continues the phone will be unusable. I am thankful that I held onto my VX4500 in case I need to go back to it. Hopefully the dropped calls will not continue and were just a fluke. But I never ran into these kinds of problems with my other phone with verizon. Be forewarned!"
1,TERRIBLE!,"This phone is absolutely terrible. My first 6100 kept dropping calls and hanging up on itself after about 7 months of use. So, I went to Verizon a couple weeks ago and exchanged it for a new one. This one, after a week, started dropping calls. It wouldn't dial out, plus this morning it says ""searching for service"". I brought it to Verizon and it basically is broken and I need to get a new phone. Needless to say, I won't be getting this one again. Also, the camera button on the side is a pain because it will take pictures of your pocket. I have to constantly delete pics."
1,8 months,"I have had this phone for only 8 months, and it is already broken. When making calls the only way to hear is by using the SPEAKER PHONE, otherwise you hear nothing. Not the ringing of the phone, and not the other person. Plus the front screen is getting dust and what not inside of it... its just bad"
2,"Jazzy phone, but does not do the basics right. Do not buy.","All right, so this phone has all the jazz, camera, speakerphone and all. But it does not do the basics right.1. the call quality is bad. period. people cannot hear me, I cannot hear people. What else is a phone good for?2. Its got a camera, and plenty of voice dialing features which I never used. What a waste of space. For example, if you want to turn the volume of the ringer high, the display shows you 5 staks of colored bars to show you the current volume level. Why in the world would you need that? A good display is one thing, a misused display is another. Poor engineering.3. standby time: 3.5 days5. talktime, I did not talk too much on it to discharge it, so I do not know.6. speakerphone is ok on the lowest volume. But as soon as you jack the volume up, the treble in the sound becomes unbearable.7. Signal reception is fine.I am returning this phone and getting a good old nokia."
1,Not the best LG I've had,"A few months ago I traded in my old LG for the newer version Verizon offered. I was really happy about it, but I always noticed there was something wrong with the service, it always took my phone way too long to connect a call.It got so bad that my phone was worthless, it wouldn't connect any type of phone calls, which meant that I had to use another phone to get my voice mail messages off let alone talk to people.Verizon ordered me a new phone and when it arrived it wouldn't stay charged. Switched the batteries and it still wouldn't charge, so they switched me with another phone.I realize that I happened to get a couple lemons for phones but I am not impressed with the way they don't check their phones when leaving the company and there are features on my new phone which make me miss my old LG.I can't wait until I can upgrade my phone."
1,Beware of the battery!!!!!,"I have three of these phones through my Verizon plan. All three the batery concked out at about 6 months into service. Now another six months later and 43 bucks a pop for batteries they are dying again!! What does Verizon & LG say but too bad! They say that it is from moisture damage. Common sense says three phones all used by differnt people NOT!! Also this phoen has an annoying habit of turning itself off! I would never buy this phonr or another LG after getting the shaft from them ,,,,,"
4,Great Phone,"This phone has been wonderful. It takes so so pictures, but I figure none of the phones out there are going to take professional photos. The contact list is easy to use and enter. The menus are state of the art. I use the ""Tools"" menu daily. I used to have a Audiovox phone that lit up when it was on vibrate in addition to vibrating...that way you could see the phone ringing if you were not right by the phone. That is the only improvement that I would add to this phone. Overall--I would recommend it."
4,Great phone,"Switched from Nokia (ATT); thought it would be hard to beat Nokia's ease of use; but this phone fits the bill. Great features, ease of use, everything...especially speaker phone which lg vx7000 does not have. Only minor downside; alarm works only if phone on; our Nokia phones always worked with them off. Also, battery life seems short, but expected with all the features. Bought 4 for the family with the great promotions from Verizon and we're all very happy...was very worried after having Nokia for over 15 years!You won't regret it; get it now w/all the great deals; the new 8000 model not coming out till Jan. and while it has speaker phone and video; the price and probably size will be much more heftier."
1,"Horrible, horrible.","DO NOT BUY THIS LG PHONE. The reception is acceptable. I am an experienced cell phone user. I found the documentation (manual, cd rom, and online) was the worst I had ever seen for any product whatsoever - really! The phone is entirely illogical in the organization of command menus. If you want to try something new, or do something you haven't in a while, pack a lunch. Just awful."
3,Not so wild,"These are more of Mr. Datz's stamp trade stories, without the practical stamp-collecting info that some of his other books have. This collection does not work as well as some of his others such as Top Dollar Paid or On The Road. He strays a little too far from the stamp focus sometimes, and reaches a little too hard for a ""wild"" or shady angle that really isn't there. Still, he's a great raconteur, and I always enjoy his yarns."
4,mbs bookclub member,"I thought the book was highly entertaining - I finished it in 4 days. It reminded me of my favorite show ""24"" with its fast pace and constantly changing aspects (scenes). One downfall was the many typographical errors, mispelling of words, and the unnecessary characters (the skulls, devils, etc) that were displayed throughout the book. Note to publisher: please use spellcheck and proof readers. Other than these, which I got over, I look forward to reading more about Mr. Monstar, Paulina and Sashay!"
4,the irony...,"Morning has Broken is a wonderful song. So wonderful, it was included in the Southern Baptist hymnal. The rights to his songs go to Islamic groups, due to his conversion and devout following. If they only knew...The Satanic Verses used this to illustrate a point. The Ayatolla Khomeni proclaimed himself the Holy Iman. But according to Islam, a Holy Iman can only get his funds from pure and Islamic means. Since he used money from Cat Stevens song royalties, he was not as Holy as he wanted his people to believe. This is why Khomeni put a price on Rushdie's head and told his followers never to read the book (among other reasons.) If they only knew...When you consider these two points, this is the most radical album released in the western hemisphere.Musically, how can you say anything bad about Cat Stevens. If he converts to Islam, as thousands do daily, there is nothing wrong with that. It's all just so...ironic."
4,Okay,"For me as an Cat Stevens lover, this CD is a must. But for the ordinary man/women I would rather recommend some other CD like ""Tea for the Tillerman"".Conclusion: It's good but surely not the best"
5,Cat Stevens-Teaser and the Firecat,I love Amazon and the selection of CD'S that they have. The speed in which I received it was GREAT!
4,Who Couldn't Like Cat Stevens?,"I know the singer/songwriter has grown into a very different person, but his music from the 70's is still classic, timeless, and masterfully sung and played. I fell in love with his music the first time I heard it and all these years later, love to listen."
5,An old friendship rekindled,Cat Stevens Teaser and the Firecat was like having a friend nearby while going through the emotional rollercoaster in those years of teen angst. I still have my vinyl copy. Having the CD means I am listening again and renewing my relationship with this old friend who has worn so well over the years and I'm glad to have the chance.
5,Opinion of a Cat Lover,"I wasn't even born when this album came out, but I grew up listening to the timeless tunes of this prolific genius. He poured his heart out onto every song and this is evident in ""Bitter Blue"" and ""The Wind"". He was on a search to find the meaning of life, one of which many of us never embark, let alone attain. It is very sad that he gave up this beautiful gift from God, but if you know what he went through to get to where he is today, you'll know why he gave it up. I don't like that many people disapprove of his choice to become Muslim, but he is happy. Even though this musical master's career was short-lived, we'll be able to enjoy his creations for a lifetime and beyond. If anyone likes folk-music, this is definitely a piece for your musical collection."
4,I owned this album in my youth.,I was a Cat Stevens fan 30 years ago( or more) This was a gift to my daughter who has recently discovered Cat Stevens and Dylan and others. She loved it.
5,Great ghost/love story novel,"This book combines the best of a ghost and a love story. It also manages to convey the gritty, seamy side of New York City where crime and muggings have become second nature and contrast it with the down-home, blues-driven, relaxed style of New Orleans life - past and present. You read of drugs, despair, saints and sinners and what happens to people who make wrong choices for what they perceive to be right reasons. You can travel back and forth in time and when the story ends, you end up knowing that there is another story still to be written about many of these characters. These people were humans with human weaknesses and failings. You could sympathize as well as recognize their fantasies and beliefs and you are satisfied at the book's end that everything came together in a complete circle of time."
4,Engaging!,"Although there were parts that were cliche or plot twists that were painfully obvious ahead of time, this book was actually a page turner! Beautifully written and historically accurate, it's part love story and part ghost story...suspensefully delicious."
1,Author indulges in pubesent binge- boring & pathetic,I loved Vaudville of Devils- and I mean LOVED IT. I ran around telling all of my friends what a wonderful author Girardi is. I take it all back. I enjoyed the ghost story parts- really fun. But the love story is so NOT a love story. It's so farfetched and thrown together without feeling that it reminds me of a erotica written by 12 year old boys. Girardi has such potential and it was completely wasted in this novel.Anyway- I completely concur with the reviewer down below here from Colorado. I thought for a second that I must have already reviewed this book- but I'm not from Colorado...
1,all research and no heart,"I was given this book because I've lived in both NYC and New Orleans, which is where the story takes place. While I found Mr. Girardi accurate in his use of words like ""lagniappe"" and ""lower east side"" I found there to be no FEELING associated with these words, no true love of what he was writing about. Many people like this book, but I was left without any feelings for this book, as a result of reading it."
3,writers beware of falling in love with main character...secret self...absolving you of need to write him likeable,colorful enough to hold interest. yet as others pointed out main character is unlikeable... whiney and overly proud of retelling bon mot momets. Got sense of author getting back at all the women who would not sleep with him IRL. they leave character after his mighty love fixes them...go figure. should reduce price of Kindle text...worth reading but not at premium price.
3,Fairly good ghost story.,"BUT... I got the feeling that the author had begun to tell one story and got side tracked into another.The New York portion seem hobbled together. The scenes and character there, with a few exceptions, seem to have no bearing on the real story, they seem thrown in , almost like padding.The pay off of the story is good , however. And I'd hazard a guess that if it is ever filmed the stuff I found questionalbe would be edited out!"
4,Decadence with a Catholic upbringing,"Contact with a ghost helps two very lost people get their lives back in order. Much of the story is set in New Orleans, great southern imagery and feeling. An magical story that I kind of wanted to believe. I liked the juxtaposition of modern problems (drugs, suicide, anexoria) with spiritual intervention"
4,"Haunted Souls, NYC, Sex, and History--Gotta Love It!","So on-target is the author in his tawdry descriptions of NYC's Lower East Side and downtown Brooklyn that I became depressed and put the book down. Something though made me stick with it. I'm glad I did. He somehow managed to tie it all together and boy was it great! I would have given it ""5 stars"" but I deducted one star for the depression."
1,"Is there a ""no star"" option?","I don't think I read the same book as the other reviewers. My opinion is that if one is going to write about a place or city, please spend some time there. As a native New Orleanian, his descriptions of the city doesn't work at all, not even as fanciful fiction, which makes me suspect his descriptions of NYC. All of that aside, the story had possibilities but its execution was terrible. Too many dead ends and ridiculous solutions to sticky situations, like the deal with Jillian or Chase!"
4,"a ghost story, a love story","Beautifully written tale of Brooklyn and New Orleans, of saints and sinners, of miracles modern and of times past. Read it and enjoy."
2,Adolescent sex fantasy,"This book is fairly well-written, and the story is kind of interesting, but I was distracted by what seems to be the author's hangup (stuck back in some Catholic high school) about sex. Someone should do a word count and see how many times the word ""breast"" appears in this novel! C'mon -- a nerdy, poor Ph.D student gets the girl, who just happens to be fabulously wealthy (family money of course, she can't be distracted by actually working), beautiful, exotic woman with the obligatory large breasts and insatiable sex appetite? And throw in some stories of forbidden sex, too -- sex with overdeveloped fourteen-year-olds and (that Catholic favorite) sex with a whore (even if she is a ghost from the 19th century). This author needs to GROW UP before he tries another novel."
2,No bluetooth!,"Any new notebook on the market MUST have bluetooth and DVI.Unfortunately, this model has only DVI, BUT NO BLUETOOTH!"
4,Our home looks lovely with these candles in the windows.,"I bought 14 of these and we like them very much. A few of the bulbs burned out too fast. We hope the replacements hold up as they are hard to match. Makes our home look old fashioned. We got them as a tribute to a family member who died this year. She always had candles in the windows, year round. We miss you Mother. The candles light the way to you.........."
4,"""MAXIMUS DUB""","IF THE ROMANS HAD DUBBED REGGAE IT WOULD BE THIS ONE.....A PERFECT BLEND OF MUSIC,VOCALS AND DUB.....AS WITH MOST OF ISREAL""s STUFF YOU'LL PLAY IT ALL DAY LONG"
5,One of the Best Bay Area Compilations of the Year!,"Dont Sleep on this Comp!Best cuts are:City of Dank-feat Baby Beesh,Southpark Mexican,IKE.Off The Hizzle-Feat Mac Dre and Dubee.Between Us-Feat. Youngbleed and Laylow.Come Git Me-Feat.Adkapone of Totally insane.Slow your Role-Feat.Mr.Kee,Gold Toes,and the Suspects.Solid all the way through!"
4,The destruction of Jerusalem by GP Holford,"I found Holford's book most informative in the way he researched and expounded on the subject of the sacking of Jerusalem in 70AD by the Romans. He then skillfully connects these historic facts up with scripture from both Old and New testamants in the Bible thereby recovering a lost understanding of Jesus Christ's teaching in Matthew 24 and corresponding passages in the New Testament. So much hype and speculation occupies the modern church's mind today about these passages, but Holford clearly demonstrates that this all happened in the first century. When this is accepted and understood by Christians the Kingdom of God takes on a whole new meaning for todays church."
4,short but good,A good book that was thought provoking although short I should the connection between the disobedience of the Jews and their judgement and how the Church came into being.
3,Something Different from Donald...But still good,Westlake is a great comic dectective author. In Pity Him Afterward he takes a different turn and gives us a picture of a psychopathic maniac turned loose. The book was fast paced and interesting. The plot had some interesting twists and the ending was surprising.
2,got eggs to fry??,What i like about the unit is the design. Not as tall as other units. Sound quality is great. Now the problem(s)! after 20 minutes of use the screen fades away and signal starts to get lost. After 30 minutes unit is usless. Turn it off for 20 minutes and it is fine for only 20 minutes. I have returned it and already have gone thru 2 other ones with same problem. Kenwood tells me that they have never heard of this problem. Other reviews on other sites are all about this problem. Unit gets so hot you could fry an egg on it. Poor vent design. Got another on the way...gonna give up after this one though. Good luck to all who buys this.
1,Fry An Egg on The Here to Anywhere,"Have had Sirius in the car with my Sirius-ready Clarion for about a year. Enjoy the service and received this with the home dock as a gift to serve as the ""dedicated"" home unit. Wasn't even plugged in 30 minutes when it started to get extremely hot and display completely disappears. Cooled it down, removed from dock and reconnected where it worked again for another 20 mins. Now I know why there are so many ""refurbished"" versions of these floating out there. Kenwood should acknowledge that these units should have been yanked from the market due to extremely poor design and obvious defects. My advice, find out how you will primarily listen to satellite radio and get separate ""dedicated"" units for both the home and the car. In the long run it will be worth a lot more than this portable junk with docking kits. This thing was DOA for me. A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!"
1,Works OK until it fails.,"I've had my H2A receiver for about a year. The display is almost useless except in total darkness, at eye level.After several months it developed a problem where touching the front panel would lock it up or erase the presets. The problem slowly got worse until I had to use the remote exclusively.This week while on the road it quit completely.I can't understand why anyone would spend more than $100 for this unit when there are better ones for half the price, or really better ones for about the same.And yes, it got really hot when it was working."
4,Sirius Radio Review,"I've rented Hertz vehicles with Sirius radio and that's how I discovered it. Satellite radio does seem to get lost sometimes -especially in parking garages and tunnels. Even in areas where trees densely populate the area - nevertheless, I prefer the Sirius radio because of the diversity of music it offers. I haven't tried XM, but Sirius has a special going on now that is going to make me invest in the package."
1,Can I get a refund?,"Got it as a birthday gift. Why not just give me some enron stock, both are worthless. Hard to read screen, difficult to scroll,flimsy buttons just to name a few problems."
1,"Repeats, and Poor Customer service","I have had the H2A for about a year and a half. I have replaced two entenas in this unit. It also has an issue that when I plug the unit into the Car kit the antenna jack in the back does not always fit properly. I emailed Kenwood and told them I have replaced two faulty antennas and asked them if there was anything they could do for me, and they wrote ""If the unit is still under warranty you can send it back to us for warranty repair"" It is an antenna! What are they going to do with it? When I called to cancel my subsription, I was on hold the first time for 15 minutes before giving up, writing and email only to be ""invited to call customer assistance to discuss my account"" and on hold the second time for over 25 minutes! Based on the shoty customer service, I would recommend that people avoid sirius! Good luck!"
1,"Sirius Radio is terrific, but this receiver is junk","The first one died after 2 months of regular use (30 commute AM and PM). The second one faded in and out, the station selection buttons worked sporadically, reception stuttered. The unit also overheats. The display is impossible to read during the daytime due to glare.Sirius is terrific and a wonderful change from the idiotic morning/evening drive time shows available locally. However, please do yourself a favor and avoid this receiver!"
1,Confused by reviews,"I thought that these books would be helpful to me as a beginner. I assumed that they were for the form of Mahj played here in the US or western. Unfortunately, the vocabulary is not familiar so I will probably try to resell them on Amazon to someone where they will be helpful."
1,"A different ""Western"" mah ....","I thought this book would help me understand the American version of Mah better and it did not. It lists many hands and the hands are titled ... but his means nothing to someone who only plays the American version who purchases a new card each year. That said, I am sure it is my ignorance in not knowing what was meant by the title...I am sure this book would be helpful to those playing the game perhaps known as Chinese Mah...and has information on scoring that I didn't know existed. Again, this is probably due to my ignorance of the game but I would never have purchased it had I known it was different than the American version. In a nutshell, had I read the reviews I would have known this and not purchased the book!"
4,Chipmunk chatter,Adorable and fun. Little dated but my granddaughter LOVES it. Apparently I have to leave 10 more words or review will not be accepted.....
1,your info is incorrect.,"This band has a 4 person lineup, jason, mason, michelle, and melynda. the only thing out there that is without melynda is the 1st 7inch which came out while i was new in the band. BUYER BEWARE. I should know, because i was in the band for years.This is way to much to pay for a cd- especially if the selling point is false information."
5,"Sweet, Sweet, Sweet","Opposites Attract, was a good read about how childhood influences affect our growth into adulthood. The main characters were completely opposite in family connection. But when they do connect, how they help each other to grow is so enjoyable. Interesting information on the Sickle Cell disease is handled to the story's advantage. They were able to discard old fears and really share themselves. You were rooting for them to 'GET THERE'. Very good read."
3,Christmas Vacation gone wacko,"I loved the First Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase and missed this when it came on tv, so I thought I would order it this Christmas, It was a cute, decent movie, not as good as the first one,but it was ok. It got a few laughs from us. I am going to make it a part of my Christmas collection and watch it every year."
1,cheap sequel,I have to agree with 95% of the one-star reviews. It would have been better with a hint of chevy chase. Or anyone else to drown out cousin eddie
2,YAY OR NAY,its okay but very disapointed it was funny but not worth buying.. Nothing tops Christmas Vacation..Save your money and time!
2,Doesn't Deserve The Title...,"I have seen some lame ideas for sequels, but this one takes the cake. I wouldn't have been so upset if the movie had a different title, but this one is simply designed to fool fans of the first. No Chevy Chase, no movie, It's that simple. We have endured the Griswolds through four different adventures. Yes, Vegas was pretty bad, but I welcome sin city compared to this. Randy Quad looks very stressed trying to carry a film by himself. He's not pretty enough, nor funny enough to be a lead. Cousin Eddie loses another job, gets a settlement for a Christmas Vacation in the tropics. Of course, Eddie screws things up and they get stranded on a deserted island. It really is absurd! Watch the original again, twice even. There will be more suprises there than in this lame duck."
1,Unwatchable,"Man how I love the Vacation movies. I love them so much that I was able to overlook all of the bad reviews this movie got and bought it anyway. Simply put, it was painful to watch and I forced myself to sit through it hoping it would get better. It really is as bad as the others say and ranks among the worst movies I've ever sat through and I'm not picky. I've turned off much better movies for being unwatchable. Made-For-TV isn't even a good excuse because it's not even good enough for that. I had hope that Cousin Eddie could salvage this mess, but he couldn't. At least in the others, the disasters were in the movie and not the movie itself. I give it one star for participation and pity only."
1,Christmas Vacation 2 Sucks!,"This movie sucked! I loved the original Christmas Vacation, but can not think of one positive thing to say about the second one."
1,Why oh why...,You know. I really enjoyed the first Christmas Vacation. When I saw CV2 on the shelf I was excited to see the saga continue. The movie starts out great....until the beginning credits end. While they did bring back an old Audrey they forget the core family...Chevy Chase and Beverly DeAngelo. Guess they knew to stay away from such a bad movie and so should you. Trust me. This movie is not enjoyable whatsoever.I would have given it no stars but they don't allow it.
2,No Chevy Chase?!?,"I SAW THIS ON TV LAST YEAR AND LET ME SAY......ANY VACATION MOVIE WITHOUT CHEVY CHASE IS A VACATION FILM THAT WILL JUST NEVER BE GOOD. CHEVY CHASE ALONE WITH DAN AYKROYD MADE ""NOTHING BUT TROUBLE"" FUN. ANY FILM THAT JUST HAS CLARK W. GRISWOLD'S RELATIVES STRANDED ON AN ISLAND FOR CHRISTMAS IS JUST DUMB. NOT ONCE DURING THE MOVIE IS CLARK EVEN MENTIONED OR IN IT. TAKE MY ADVICE AND DON'T ARGUE WITH ME:NOT RECOMMENDED!!"
2,Would have been better with Chevy Chase,"I'm quite surprised at myself saying that, as I normally can't stand Chevy Chase - but I've discovered I can't stand Randy Quaid something worse! I think I would have preferred to watch Chevy, cos he's actually better.It's not completely a bad movie - I enjoyed the sunshine on the island, and it's a lot better than the depressing weather outside, just 4 days before Christmas. Uncle Nick's character was fabulous as soon as he appeared on screen, but he was the film's only saving grace. These National Lampoon movies (from what I've watched) seem to lurch from one overly predictable and highly unlikely disaster to the next. And there's something between Clark & Ellen from the previous movies, that make them utterly watchable - even if it is Chevy Chase.I wouldn't be recommending this movie to anyone anytime soon. It was a waste of time watching it, and I'm sure you could find something much better to do with your precious time."
1,This Movie Stinks!!!!!,This is quite possibly the very worst movie ever made.The acting skill level was sub-zero and the story was poorly constructed.I can't think of one good thing to say about the movie except that it does end.Save your time for something worth watching.
2,Not the best Lampoom movie,"In this Christmas Vacation, Uncle Eddy is the star of the show. Chevy Chase (Clark) doesn't appear in it one bit. Audrey does return, though. The plot is that while on a tour of an island Uncle Eddy and the gang get marooned on an island. There they have to work to survive. They need each other. It all turns out to be a pretty good film. However, this does not even compare to the other National Lampoom films. And it certainly doesn't compare to the first Christmas Vacation. Sure it does have its laughs and funny parts, but it still doesn't come close to the others."
1,Amazing! SO much better than the first movie!,"Why waste your time watching the crumby original ""Christmas Vacation"" movie this Christmas Eve,when you can do yourself the incredible honor of watching ""Christmas Vacation 2:Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure""?! This movie is SOOOO Funny,that I had to clean up and change my underwear after watching it,because I laughed so hard during this amazing funny movie,that I must have pi$$ed my pants at least twenty times! Chevy who??? Randy Quaid should have won an Oscar for this masterpiece! Hopefully maybe his brother Dennis will do all of us a favor and star along side him in ""Christmas Vacation 3:New RV Toilet for my brother Eddie"".Guess we'll just have to keep our fingers crossed,that it comes out maybe next Christmas."
2,Stick with the original!!!,"Christmas Vacation is a classic, but this 'sequel' kind of ruins the moment. They never show Clark, or Ellen. They do, however have the original Audrey Griswold from the original Vacation. After Eddie loses his job, he gets a free vacation to an island. Soon, Eddie and his family get shipwrecked on the island. They all decide to celebrate Christmas on the island. I probably wouldn't recommend CHRISTMAS VACATION 2: COUSIN EDDIE'S ISLAND ADVENTURE!!!"
2,"Aw ....cut poor cousin Eddie some slack,","After all, he does have that steel plate in his head! Yes, Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase will forever live on as a classic for most of us but knowing that Randy Quaid has the guts to walk around in his skivies was worth viewing this made for television movie. I watched it, I laughed but we all know that rarely does a sequel compare to the original. Not sure I will reserve a copy of the forthcoming DVD (only because 2010 is a bit of a wait) but I will continue to hold Randy Quaid in the highest of regards for his unique portrayal of cousin Eddie. P.S. I think Snot did a fantastic job of reviving his role..LOL"
3,Christimas Vacation 2,This is just okay. Love the original vacation a 100% better. Not Chevy Chas in this movie. Eddy is just Eddy.
3,Nothing like the other 'Vacation' series,Was expecting a much better movie than this is. This is probably why I never heard of it being in a theater!
2,"Well, it could be worse","Let me just say this movie is bad. It was very poorly produced. Its worse than a made for tv movie. They steal all the worth while jokes and gags from all of the Vacation movies. It should be an extra on European Vacation DVD.If the orignal Vacation got 10 points, and Christmas Vacation got 9 points, this stinker would get 1.5 points.The good. You get to see Dana Barron-Audrey-from the original Vacation. She is very hot in my opinion and brings the movie up to at least barely watchable.Bottom line- If you are a hard core Vacation fan and a sentimentalist, see this movie. If your not, then don't. I heard from many people it was really bad, but it didn't matter, I had to see it for myself. And I am not disapointed I did."
1,Avoid at all costs...,"This was, perhaps, the worst cinematic experience of my life. My family has a tradition of watching ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Christmas Vacation"" every holiday season. We looked forward to this new edition into the ""Vacation"" series of movies...but wow, did they ever screw things up. There was not one instance in this ""film"" that I smiled. Not once. Quite frankly, there were parts in this film which made me cringe! Especially the young boy...I've never seen a creepier character in all my life. Absolutely terrible (I can't say this enough...if only they had a -5 stars, I'd give it that). Not only did they manage to screw up the character of Cousin Eddie, they almost managed to ruin the Vacation films for me. Thank goodness I can forget that I ever saw this, and continue to enjoy the original Christmas Vacation. Don't bother buying this piece of trash...unless you're a glutton for punishment."
1,Still bad after all these years,"No one has bothered to write a review of this movie since 2004 for a good reason. No one has watched it. We still laugh about it in our family because it was so bad. Since we watch Christmas Vacation every Christmas season, it is sad that Christmas Vacation 2 was such a stinker. I guess Randy Quaid has been on the run ever since. And Ed Asner, you must be ashamed of this movie or else really broke - did you read the script before signing on ??? Perhaps if you get this movie for 50 cents at a garage sale and are really drunk, you might appreciate it. For the rest of us, just re-watch the original Christmas Vacation."
2,"Gee, I miss Chevy.","Plot logic strays in this sequel to a film that hasn't been made yet. Why doesn't the bathroom ever get fixed? One scene has water gushing and flooding everywhere, and then, it's all gone! Who fixed it? Why does Cousin Eddie's family keep their clothes so neat and white stranded on the island? Loved the only original scene where the giant fish pulls Eddie's boat into the island. Could survive without Eric Idle getting absurdly hurt in every scene. Disliked scenes of church hymns and prayers and censored nudity to make more of a ""children's film"" or sitcom out of the whole thing. Has John Hughes left our planet, because if I were him, like Eddie I might sue the boss for injury, too. Hughes and Chevy, where are you?"
1,Horrid,"This is awedul. God knows why Quaid, Idle and other great actors got involved with this mess. I had to stop it after a half hour."
1,Absolutely Terrible,Don't waste your money on this sequel. It is absolutely the dumbest movie ever produced. There is not one scene that is even close to funny. The original Christmas Vacation was by far the better movie. Find something better to do with your two hours...trust me.
4,In the eye of the beholder,I love National Lampoons Vacation movies.I had never heard of this one so I had to get it.I really like Randy Quaid and he is just as goofy as ever.You must have a sense of humor to watch this.I must admit if Chevy Chase & Beverly DeAngelo was in it it would have been even funnier.But its good to watch
3,Decent supplemental book,This wasn't a bad supplemental book for pharmacology. I didn't really use it that much but it did help if I needed to look up drugs in more detail.
4,Just a good book..,"This book is a good one, but has one little problem, the book doesn't have much coherence because there are too many people writting the book. You can note the difference of redaction between the chapters because were written for different person and that's what make the book very difficult to read, because one chapters are good, but others are very bad.I prefer a book written by a few person because are much clear."
2,????,"A tomar clases de canto chicas, urgente! El CD es bien bailable pero las voces de algunas de estas chicas no son de lo mejor. Su nuevo CD titulado -Zache- esta mucho mejor, se nota una gran mejoria en las voces."
3,Decent movie,"Director Sanjay Srinivas has handled a few sequences well.Talking of on-screen performances, Salil Ankola does reasonably well. Tom Alter is efficient. Sonali Kulkarni is wasted in an insignificant role. Arif Zakaria is alright. Newcomer Alekh Sangal gets ample scope and he does quite well.Cinematography (Sejal Shah) is inconsistent. The background score is effective.cricket is life line of youth nowardaysevery one want to see excitement"
3,Interesting....,"The story is interesting adventure of a mystic. The flow of the story is a bit scattered and the contents beyond what is normally considered rational. Coming from a western point of view, I found parts of it hard to believe. On the other hand, it gives light to how hard it was living during the Vietnam war and after when the communist regime took over."
5,Great Beach Read!!!!!!,"I found myself drawn into this novel from the very first chapter. I loved the way the various settings were portraited so well through words. I could almost 'feel' the island breeze on Solitaire, and the cool waters of Blue Bonnet Bay. Each character was well established as part of the story line, and I loved the background material. I plan to read this book again, and give it as gifts. Great reading material for a beach vacation."
5,This Book Should Be Given to Every New Mason.,"This Book Should Be Given to Every New Mason, and would be recommended reading for all Masons. The book is great, to the point, with straight worth while information. It would take years to learn/compile the information within, but you can have it now, all in this one book.Everyything."
1,What A Dud,I loved this watch the minute I opened the box. It was gorgeous! It worked for one day then quit. I could not believe it. I paid extra to buy a good work watch because I was irritated by having less expensive watches quit within a month of purchase. So I was looking forward to this one.
5,Reference material,"On a topic not often covered at length in reference books, this volume fills a gap, research wise, and that is all there is to say."
2,They called them Angels,"It is a review of literature, reports from nurses and historical nursing textbooks. Would like it to more in story format."
3,The Merchant was Far too Slow,"I ordered a Stearns Life Jacket for my handicappedteenage son, for a cruise, so he would not drown.I ordered it for overnight shipping.It never got here before we left. It arrived 3 daysafter we left.This seller was useless."
5,For the Sailor or hobbyist alike,"I have used this book quite often since I started my journey with the Navy. This guide, coupled with a basic knowledge of electronics and electricity, will prove an invaluable aid to both inexperienced, and experienced alike. I strongly recommend this book."
1,Way over my head,I bought 3 books about basic electronics in an attempt to understand why hearing aids don't work. The other two books were helpful for learning about amplifiers and microphones but this Basic Electronics for Naval Training was way over my head.For me this book was a waste but if you are building your own nuclear submarine this book may be helpful.
1,Ancient,Lots of info about electronics during the 60's and 70's...poor choice if you are interested in IC's or anything even remotely recent.
3,i expected a little more,"this dvd reviews 15 classic hurricane games dating back to when it all started the 1983 championship game. the commentator on the dvd does a good job telling the story for each game and putting them in to perspective, such as what the teams record was at that point whether they were underdogs or favorites etc before showing the highlight clips. BUT the highlight clips for each game though are very short probably about 3 minutes i expected a lot more actual football highlights for each game. and many of these games you can watch 9 and 10 minute highlight clips of on youtube. so to me there should have been more bang for the buck"
4,Visual delight,A must have visual delight for gardeners who love formal balance and design. A primer for big impact in small spaces.
2,Good Basic saw but don't try find accessories for it,If you just want to make cuts this saw is fine. But the miter is not a standard size so finding accessories to use with it is impossible. Also Wilton does not even acknowledge they make a table saw on their web-site. Strange company.
4,Good detailing model hobby brush!,I laugh when amazon.com asks me to rate the education and 'fun' value of this 'toy'. Anyways this is a Tamiya ultra fine tip model hobby paint brush that I bought in addition to a brush 3 pack I already had. One can never have enough extra paint brushes at their disposal when building plastic model kits. Brush seems to be of good quality without hairs falling out or getting frayed.
1,forced advertisiments,"picked this up as a two disk set for half this price. warning, you have to sit through 11 minutes, that is right 11 minutes of forced movie trailers which you cannot skip!"
1,disappointing,"I had hoped to get a biography of Nero, instead I learned all about the ancient world and the wars that Rome was involved in. Truly disappointing."
3,Good value for intermediate learners,"This book comes with 4 CDs, so it is a very good value. However, if you are a complete beginner you can't possibly learn to speak Greek from these CDs because they progress too quickly. You need to start with Pimsleur Greek 1 because it progresses very slowly and teaches you phrases you can really use. Then you can use Take Off in Greek or the Rosetta Stone course for your second course."
5,A Great Refresher!,"I've decided to bring my Modern Greek back up to speed, and read the reviews of different products to decide where to start. This set looked promising from previous reviews. It's lived up to my hopes, and I'm very pleased with my choice."
3,Cram session,"This book crams a lot of information into a few pages. It gives a general overview of items and information, but goes over it very very quickly. The grammer sections in the chapters need more explanation and examples. However the grammer reference section is useful assuming you know what you're looking for. The tests are OK, but there are not many examples. Also there is only a Greek to English dictionary in the back. This would be a nice book when supplemented by a dictionary and additional reference material or person."
3,Finally! A Nat Shilkret CD!!,"Nathaniel Shilkret, Musical Director at Victor in the 20s and 30s , and leader of The Victor Orchestra has been often overlooked in the history books. This CD offers 23 classic Shilkret tracks featuring musicians like Andy Sannella, Del Staigers, Mike Mosiello and everpresent 20s vocalists like Franklyn Baur, Johnny Marvin and Scrappy Lambert. This CD is must for a beginner, although die-hard collectors will not appreciate the horrible job of sound restoration, nor the omission of many of the better known Shilkret sides (""Hallelujah!""; ""It's a Million to One You're In Love"";""Something To Tell"" and ""Me And My Shadow"" are alas not present!) Still, at least Nat Shilkret is now present and accounted for on a medium other than Shellac. That's good enough for me."
1,amateurish noise reduction,"The noise reduction on this CD and others from the same producer is uniformly amateurish. On almost all tracks, the music is severely damaged by digital artifacts, caused by the misguided attempt to eliminate every trace of surface noise."
5,"Very flexible, works great","This wire cover was very supple and easy to put in place. It is heavy and durable, came with 2-sided tape, but was so heavy that I really didn't need the tape to stick it in place."
5,The best,Cindy is one of the best in the business. She encorages. And motivates I will be ording more of he workouts since they no longer have excercise tv in our area. If you want great abs get this video I dare you to do the deadly 7!
4,Solid DVD,These are good ab workouts for beginner to intermediate. Not a challenge for intermediate to advanced. I workout daily and I am intermediate to advanced and I will usually do 2-3 of these routines at one time.
4,Domino toy works well,Very ingenious toy. Toy works well on smooth surfaces. Does not work well on tile floors. Would be really nice if the truck could be controlled by using a remote.
2,I really don't like this toy,"My son spotted this in Ross one day and had to have. Thank goodness it only cost $10 because this toy is the bane of my existence. It is so frustrating! It was difficult to put together, the car only works in the kitchen on the tile, and the tiny pieces get everywhere. I made it disappear pretty quickly."
2,"Poor quality, but dominos are still dominos","The truck gets clogged up often, it is extremely difficult for our kids to load and they almost always require an adult to load. The tower is decent, albeit, it doesn't quite work as advertised as well. Our kids wound up just knocking down the dominos the old fashioned way. I grew up in the ""Domino Rally"" days and compared to the original toys, these don't stack up.The truck and tower just aren't worth it, you are better off buying a bag of dominoes and letting your kids make their own domino trails."
3,Fun toy and sells for around $10,Got this at Walmart 2 years ago for $10. I don't know how anyone could sell it for $50-$60! My son had fun making designs with the dominoes and having the truck set them up also. Good for 4-5 year olds.
1,Mere words cannot plumb the depths of my hatred.,"Ok, maybe that's a bit strong, but this is hands down our most hated toy (by the adults, and the kids are plenty frustrated, too). We received it as a gift (and WOW whoever would pay $35 for this is CRAZY.). Our son is nearly five & needs help to load the truck, which has to be loaded fully to work without jamming; a time-consuming procedure, since the dominoes have to be loaded one-at-a-time. The dominoes themselves are also almost too lightweight to stand well on end, and are prone to easy collapse. After the initial newness wears off this toy is going to disappear, and that's something I've never even contemplated before."
4,Entertaining,"Fun toy for kids 4 and up but wish it had come with a few spare parts. Some of the dominoes clip on in a special way and if you lose those, it no longer will do all it is supposed to. But it works better than you would think and can still be used even when a piece or two disappears."
1,never play with it,dominoes were smaller than we initially thought and our son does not play with this...now I understand why we bought it on such a discounted sale...pass on this toy...
3,assembly required - very difficult,"Yup - the reviews are correct- shipping sucks, box full of parts, terrible insturctions, one part cut wrong.But the toy is great once together - especially for the price."
4,The murderer in his own words!,"This book reveals a side of Lyle Menendez, that will perhaps be a shock to many people. It's a book based on conversations between Norma Novelli and Lyle, while he was awaiting his first trial. It quickly becomes clear that Norma doesn't believe that Lyle was abused by his parents. She mentions how he with pride mentioned that this case was one of the biggest ever in America. The book even includes a letter that he wrote to a former girlfriend, telling her how to testify in court. Throughout the book, Lyle is described as a cold and manipulative person, who Norma believes is a remorseless killer."
1,Boring- no new info,"I thought this was a fairly boring view into this case....I was so excited to read it from the jacket- and then found out it was of little interest at all. The beginning was especially hard to get ""into""....It turns out that Lyle doesn't really have very much to say, after all."
1,more marketing of crap,There is nothing in this book that people have not heard on the news. It is a total waste of money. Who the heck believes any of his lies. He is a cold blooded killer that killed his own mother for nothing.
4,Cheap But Good,"I needed something like this product but didn't want to spend alot for it. The only problem that I had with it was that something fell out of the mechanism one day and now the bits don't stick inside of it anymore. Otherwise, good product."
3,The mote in Joy Electric's eye,"This is the one Joy Electric album that I've found to be disappointing. First of all, I really think it should have been labeled as a single - ""Monosynth"" is the same ""Monosynth"" from the Robot Rock album, untouched. Then come three remixes. Of these, I think only ""The Cobbler"" really holds up well. ""Sugar Rush"" is just dismal - this is meant to be a fast, bouncy song, not this slow and rather weak attempt at D&B. ""I'm Your Boy"" is a forgettable remix. The only reason this EP gets three stars rather than two is that out of nowhere comes the final, all-new track, ""The North Sea."" This is probably the most beautiful, sad and melancholy track JE has ever concieved. With no percussion sounds, its very simple and very pure. Gorgeous, and even possibly worth the price of an EP where none of the other tracks are worth your time."
3,unreleased songs for a reason?,i love joy electric and have ever since i saw them tour for 'melody'...but that doesn't help my reaction to this mistake... joy electric does not do 'drum and bass' well at all....their cd's have consistently improved since melody...but this is bad...the robot rock single saves it....at least the next 2 cd's were better...much better
1,riddled with typos,"As published by General Books, who used optical character recognition (OCR), this book has too many typos - and I mean serious typos: (page 1, ""TV/TILLIONS of men are ..."";page 3,""$rounb tfye tDtcket HEAT numbers of persons ..."" and so on. I realize that the term 'typo' probably is not the best term for OCR flubs, but this book was a real publishing disappointment. Not worth the price, no matter how low."
1,NEVER GOT IT!,I would love to tell you how much I enjoyed this cookbook but I never got it and never got a response from the people who were supposed to ship it to me.
5,Love it!,"When my husband and I first got married and I realized I was expected to do the cooking, I panicked. Having no previous experience I went out and bought several cookbooks aimed at amateurs, such as I was. It was disastrous. I finally just stuck with what was safe - 20 different versions of the baked chicken breast. It was only successful as a weight loss plan. Finally a friend introduced me to this cookbook and a year later my husband has gained thirty pounds. Now I am threatening to put him back on the chicken breast diet, if he doesn't shape up. I am ordering this book today for my newlywed sister (because I can't give mine up!) and have ordered The Taste of Home Cookbook for myself. I can't speak highly enough of these books."
4,Best Cookbook I've owned,My Mother got me this as a gift right after I first got married. My husband and I are both really picky eaters and to this day this has the most recipes that we actually like out of all the cookbooks we've purchased. Most only have 1-3 recipes we like at best but this has many we like and have become regulars on our meal plans. There are also lots of tips for novice cooks we have referenced these a few times but we're decent cooks so we don't use them really just love the recipes.
1,TRACK LISTING WRONG,"Please be aware this CD does not contain 32 tracks, but rather 17. Have had this happened on these ""Roots & Blues"" CDs before so check another source for track listing on CDs when purchasing!!"
3,Where's the screaming guitars?,"This would be an unbelieveable cd except the mix is terrible. I saw David Jo around this time and believe the guitars were loud..As they should be for a ROCK N ROLL BAND!..With all the modern technology the record company couldn't adequetely remix this show by providing some audible..less MUDDY + MUFFLED guitars! It sounds no better than the six track album sampler released in 78. (For those new to DAVID JO, BLUE SKY RECORDS RELEASED SIX TRACKS FROM THIS SHOW ON VINYL IN 1978) The band gets an A for effort...The RECORD COMPANY GETS AN F FOR A BAD REMIX!!!PS DOES ANYONE HAVE THE DAVID JO LUNCHTIME SHOW FROM 1981 BROADCAST ON WNEW FM ?SINCERELY,CHARLIE"
4,A ton of Fun,Buster Poindexter was fun but also had a very limited shelf life. The newer Blues records are cool but hard to get too excited about.This record is a ton of fun and stands head to head with Live It Up as David Johansen's best solo releases. I highly recommend it.
2,"Awful, pirated-sounding recording of a brilliant concert","Five stars for an AMAZING concert (similar to the one I saw him give live in L.A.) by The Master - Ruben Blades - my personal, musical, and political hero, and the best songwriter and singer alive today.Zero stars for a virtually unlistenable amateur production. It's a horrible, mushy mix, that I doubt even came off the mixing board, and is unsuitable for discriminating ears. Not much EQ or dynamic range, and a very poor, and constantly-changing, mix/balance throughout.I can almost guarantee that Ruben Blades had nothing to do with, and would not approve of, this release. I suspect the audio (and it's accompanying video, which I also bought) were pirated. What a shame. I would give almost anything to have a top-quality DVD concert production of Ruben Blades in all his glory with Editus et al. This is nothing that anyone would want to listen to twice - if you can even make it through once without wincing."
5,The Civil War from Abatis to Zouave,"Having recently completed a project on the American Civil War, I have to say that the ""Historical Times Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Civil War"" is hands down my favorite of the Civil War reference books in encyclopedic form. 850 pages packed with terminology, battle information, and all the critical dates. What I like the most though is the large amount of biographical information on so many of the key figures in the war, from diplomat Charles Francis Adams, Sr. to Confederate general Felix Kirk Zollicoffer, and most of them with photographs, to help put a face with the names. A wonderfully written and thoroughly researched book which makes every effort not to take a side, but rather to just provide all the essential information. Definitely a must have for anyone interested in the American Civil War."
3,"Fun, but WAY TOO NOISY!","I was thrilled to see a Darth Vader toy that I could safely give to my three year old storm trooper for Christmas. Sadly, I did not read the description closely enough to see that it 'talks'. Not only does it talk, it talks loudly, every time you pull the handle for the flashlight. There is no off switch. No volume control. No way to have light without the sound. The sound quality is also rather poor, which makes it very unpleasant. On the plus side, it is easy to operate, even for a tiny toddler. Still, I would give it 1 star, but that would not be fair, considering the fact that I should have read the description more carefully before buying it, but we decided NOT to give it to our son. It will be donated to some unknown child that we hope lives far away."
2,not worth it,"Maybe this item got bounced around one too many times in shipping because it was always loud. The previous model I had (same look and abilities but white) was not particularly loud, lasted over four years, and was used a lot more than this model was. This one barely lasted through one cold season in the southern US and was only used about 1 or 2 hours a day. It stopped working a week after we got it out for the next winter so I couldn't return it. Because I was very pleased with the first one of these I got and because I don't know what type of treatment this one went through during shipping I can't give it a totally bad review. It is a real powerhouse for a tiny heater and I really like that about it."
1,ONLY LAST ONE WINTER !!!!! ITS 2011 and its OUT!!!,I brought this in 2010 for winter for the bathroom as soon as it falls or you bump it the fan breaks its gone! It moves on hard surfaces and once you bump it the noise starts. DO NOT BUY!!!! ONLY LAST ONE YEAR!!! :(
1,Don't buy it!,"It works fine until you bump it, and then the plastic fan blades break off. It is also noisy and moves around on a hardwood floor. On the positive side, it did give off a nice amount of heat for the few months that it worked."
3,Faulty heater,I purchased 2 of these heaters. They work pretty good for heating up a room. The only problem is that one of the heaters I purchased starting sparking about a month after I had purchased it so I had to quit using it. I cant find any information on this company online and internet addy they have on the back of the instruction sheet takes me to some other website for a store that sells the heaters. So now I can't use one of the heaters I purchased. Guess I will have to pay the shipping and send it to the address on the instruction sheet and try to get a refund or a new heater.
3,OK heater but noisy,"It works fine and heats quickly, but it is very noisy. It also has to be put on something with a texture to it, or it starts to move around as it heats. It could easily fall off the edge of something if it is not being watched."
1,Bad Vibration,"I bought this heater because it was noted that it was very quite. Well, it is not. Although the fan is quite, it vibrates severely. If it is on a hard surface, you cannot take it at all. It sounds like a dump truck going by. On a Carpet it is not too bad. It is going back to Amazon. I had also liked the concept of a cleanable filter. Too bad it did not work. It is too expensive and not quite at all."
1,Trips electricity,"I never got to test this product because it trips electricity. I tried it on other outlets where I generally use fridge, TV, etc. but no success . Then I took off other appliances and just plugged it in, but it tripped the electricity switch .... not worth the effort .. .returning it"
4,Great little heater.,Works fantastically in a small room - this little thing throws a lot of heat. The outside stays cool and automatically turns off when it's not resting level on the ground. Totally worth the money.
2,Died in 2nd winter,"I'm not sure how well this would work for a room, but for under my desk, it works great. It's quiet, takes up little space, and it heats me up without burning my legs. Its settings are very versatile.Update 12/27/2011Unfortunately this heater died a couple of months ago and I had to get a new one (not this model)."
3,did what I wanted,"I bought this to extend a radio antenna higher so I could get a signal and it works for that, I would guess it works fine on what it was intended for."
3,Pinzon 400 Thread count,These sheets were great for the price I just thought they would be softer because they were called egyptian cotton and 400 thread count they feel like regular sheets.
1,Arrive all over you by Danielle Brisebois,"After months of searching, I found the out of print cd here. I had never heard it, but after hearing the fabulous song ""My Only"" from the ""Good as it gets"" movie soundtrack, I had to hear the album. What a disappointment! Oh well, it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song!"
3,Not good for small frames ... bottle falls easily,"This is an ultra light and sleek cage. It comes with aluminum bolts and well packaged. However, if you have a small frame (mine is 49) it is not easy to take the bottle in & out. It was also very easy for the bottle to fall thru when I hit a few bumps. I'm returning it."
3,LightNfitz,"Very light weight, recieved broken, slight crack, really liked overall product and kept it. Can be mounted on upper bar or regularlly..."
5,Dai Ko Myo,"Very nice cd, very relaxing, good for meditation, enjoyed listening to it on a long road trip along with Cho Ku Rei."
1,Letdown,"I saw this on the store shelf, with a cover showing lots of production pages; since it was called IN THE STUDIO WITH MICHAEL GOLDEN, I expected to see how a comic book artist creates a full package. The packaging promises to take the viewer ""behind the scenes and into his studio, for an exclusive look at this groundbreaking creator as he discusses the processes he undertakes to create his unparalleled artwork!""Well, what you get is a man sitting in a chair for six chapters, mostly giving opinions, and telling us how little he draws unless he's being paid (he's more of a ""thinker,"" you see.) There is an ""extra"" feature where he draws a character while giving more opinions.And the quality was poor; pixelation and poor audio. DEFINITELY not worth 29.95. The store was selling it for half price, so I don't feel as bad; there were a few interesting opinions, at least. But this is not in the studio at all."
4,Great source for Exam Prep,"Highly recommend this book for exam preparation. This book will help you focus on the materials necessary for the particular exams and leave you well prepared. Your exam prep should also include practice exams. Can't recommend the CD one way or the other, because after having read the other reviews I used SelfTest software for the practice exams instead.I bought this book solely to help me prepare for the CLP exams, which it did. However, it was a little irritating that the chapters weren't organized by test content. This book was very poorly edited, but that seems to be the trend in most exam prep books, including the MCSE series.I'm sure I'll continue to use this book as a reference guide from now on. It presented some things much better than the Lotus documentation ever did."
3,Covers a lot but many errors and the enclosed CD did not work,"The SA-part are very nice but the AD-part is not THAT good but still OK. I could'n get the enclosed CD to work properly. When trying to launch the test exams, it returned an error and stopped executing. I've tried it in Win95, 98 and NT4 with the same result. But the book is really worth reading but do get the 28 page (!) errata that is available on their internet site!"
1,Poor effort from New Riders,After seeing that the average number of stars given for this book is 4 I am left wondering whether I have a completely different version on my hands. It is bad enough that the book wasn't edited properly before release - a 28 page errata is available on their internet site - but there are also numerous technical faults that leave me qestioning the information I read. I am about to sit the final exam in my CLP. On reflection I would have been better off downloading documentation from the Lotus site (as I ended up doing) and paying for dedicated exam CDs instead of buying this book To add insult to injury the publishers suggest that they are interested in feedback as part of continuous improvement. I emailed them 6 weeks ago - still no response.
1,Poor test application on CD,"An overall judgement for this book can only be POOR based on the following: 1 - The test app. on CD contains faulty answers 2 - The test app. does not work at all if you aren't changing your ""international settings"" to ""English (American). Otherwise you get an ""floating point error"" 3 - To read about 1 test you have to jump between chapters 4 - The so called ""support"" from the publisher aren't interested to know about note 2. They say you have to buy an American Windows OS to get it work. When calling back to inform them about the solution they asked ""Is it working ?"" and I answerd yes. Then they replayed quote ""So why are you calling then ?"" unquote"
4,Very good study resource for Notes R4 exam,"I'm as a non native English reader, I can't found big error in the book when I was reading it. However, this book helped me pass SA1 with 91 score despite 64 required to pass, at my first test. I feel that only Instructor Leaded Text book in the class is not enought to get high score."
3,Where to downlaod the errata?,"Can anybody tell me where to download the errata? I've searched mcp.com and did found the book. But I can't find any errata to download. BTW, is there any errata for the CD? I doubt the answers of many questions in CD. Also, large portion of the questions in CD ain't covered in the book. Is it really enough to take the exam just by this book?"
2,they must have changed the formula,"I bought this make-up in NYC at Henri Bendel about 7 years ago. Paula Dorf was actually at the store and did my make up. I fell in love with this product. I have purchased it intermittently throughout the years, but I haven't used it in a while. I have been using Chanel foundation and have really liked it, but wanted to try this again to do a comparison.It is so oily. When I rub my forehead it's like I rubbed baby oil on my skin. I'm so disappointed. It's really an inferior product compared to the original formulation. Too bad."
3,can't find replacement heads,"This grill brush is very nice. Great shape works great, but I can't find the replacement heads for it. Any help?"
2,"Great concept, poor quality","I like Photoshop Album. The user interface is quite intuitive, it's reasonably fast and it has all the features I need for working with thousands of digital photos.However, it wouldn't have hurt if Adobe had spent a few more QA cycles on it. I have updated to 2.0.1, but it's still pretty shaky.Try to type european special characters via Alt+0xxx in the caption line - BOOM.Try to import photos from a folder that also contains Quicktime videos (which my digital camera generates) - BOOM, and no workaround. There are now whole areas of my photo collection that I cannot view because I have accidentally imported Quicktime videos...I don't use the ""Creations"" and ""Online Services"" parts of the program at all, so I can't say anything about them.I'd give four stars if the quality was reasonable. Let's hope the next version is better."
1,Terrible Application,"Most likely one of the most frustrating applications ever to pollute my hard drive! I'm an avid user of Photoshop, I think it's a wonderful application, so how can the folks at Adobe create Photoshop Album, and screw it up so bad?!? The program crashes, ruins pictures, makes slide shows of your pictures all cropped wrong, with no option to change it.Run!"
3,"You got that ""Microsoft Feeling""","With Version 1 and 2 it looks like Adobe has picked up the ""Just good enough"" attitude from Microsoft. They feel because it's a low price consumer product that they don't have to put the product through the quality testing that they do for the higher priced products....I would recommend ACDsee as they take there product seriously and provide support."
1,Rebate Scam,Beware. Adobe is not honoring the rebate on this item. That and the poor quality of this software mean that you should look elsewhere.
2,Do not rush to buy this product!,Before buying this product go to Adobe Photoshop Album user forums. There has been much disatisfaction with version 1.0 and the jury is still out on 2.0.For me the biggest flaw is the inability to make good quality VCDs let alone DVD quality. VCDs I have made are low quality with blurred images. I only use the product for email of slideshows using the .pdf Acrobat Reader format--that is excellent.
2,Good for kids,"PS Album 2.0 is an easy, very basic program. Relative to others it is slow and childish. You must ""import"" photos before you can view them, a nuisance others avoid. You cannot combine categories, e.g., to select all ""Vacation"" photos which are also ""2003"". Among the heavily promoted album programs, ACDSee is a better choice although its current version has a few annoying bugs."
1,Full of Bugs,I would avoid this software. Download Picasa for free try out and see how it works. I have had nothing but problems with this version of photoshop album. I purchased it because I had used 1.0 and it worked pretty good. I have had lots of troubles with colors being different on the thumbnails fron the true colors. Lots of bugs and crashing. You must pay for support also - doens't seem fair.
1,WENT NUTS TRYING TO CONVERT FROM VER. 1.0,"I'm an unhappy camper. I used ver. 1 and put much of my digital library into it. Now I upgrade (upgrade?) and it doesn't know how to sync with that which it created before. I don't know how the other features perform, because I'm still futzing trying to get my photos in sync with it! Shame on you Adobe, shame. By the way, how do you plan on paying me, one of your unwitting beta testers?"
1,Is the rebate included?,"Some retailers sell the Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0 with a $15.00 ""upgrade rebate"" coupon in the box, others sell it without such a rebate. For an ""under $50 product"", the rebate makes 30% difference in price.Amazon does not want to tell me whether they sell that product with or without the rebate coupon inside the box.Thus, I would rate the Amazon Album bought from Amazon at the lowest possible rating, 1 point.Regards, Lubos."
2,Fatally Flawed Product,"Adobe's created a really great product - see other reviews for the many great features. Unfortunately, PSA also hides any directory name manipulation from the user - presumably in an effort to increase ease of use. Sadly, this means that 1) You can't combine using Photoshop Album with other photo managment programs in a meaningful way 2) You can't change the location of your photos (like, to a different disk) once they're in the catalog 3) Restoring from backup destroys your directory data 4) Saving to CD loses your directory data.What it does it does well, but if any of the above problems bother you, consider a different program."
3,"No folder synching, too bad...","I've been using v1.0 for at least 6 months and I've recently purchased v2.0. I love the new interface and the collections feature however, I still don't understand why Adobe does not include a ""watch folder/synching"" feature. Picasa or even PictureIt! have it and this is a real time-saver!I usually download pics from my camera into the ""My Pictures"" folder. Now, I'd love my photo album software to pick up the newly added images. By the same token, it should also remove the pics if deleted from that folder. This is called ""synching"" and due to the lack of that feature it is a real pain to manually add pictures everytime you store them into a Windows folder, not to mention worrying about importing duplicates (there is a feature warning you about duplicates but it is based on name, so if you rename the pictures then you're hosed!)."
2,Hmmmm....one for the dedicated fan....,"Some good moments among the discordant weirdness, but not enough really. Probably best buy their other albums first."
3,Learning,"The book was interesting but not as informative as I had hoped. Some of the info was too ""clinical"" and not really what I would expect from a Handbook. When I write a handbook it contains step by step instructions for anyone to pick it up and not be confused. I was hoping for some pointers or where to obtain tools such as dop sticks. It was a good buy though."
4,Facet Cutters Handbook,"Having just taken up faceting, I find that this book is great to have on my table, when I am trying to work out angles and designs."
2,Slightly Helpful,"I was excited to get my book, thinking it would have faceting diagrams. There really wasn't anything you would call a diagram, just some instructional sections. The how to part was OK, but it was 'old school', refering to cutting the crown first. I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone, but OK for a different point of view (or historical reference)."
1,GACET CUTTERS HANDBOOK,This book is a good look into the past about what the early faceters did before Gem Cad. I have cut some of the designs in this book after updating them just to compare them to today's designs. I don't recomend it for anyone who is just learning to facet. However for someone who already knows how and just wants a glimpse into the past. It is worth the price. It's not good for any other purpose in my opinion though.
1,"Looks cool, but save your money.","I saw this on the benches of every great model builder on You-Tube, so I figured that I just had to have it. Here's the knock, Bob Smith gap-filling superglue, with some disposable fine-tip glue applicators will do every thing this product claims to do and better. I love the brush-on applicator that comes with this glue, but after a few people handled my model I started noticing bombs, landing gear, etc. getting knocked off far too easily. Not a very secure bond. weak"
5,Classic!,"Please Please guys listen to Pat..THE underated guitarist of the the last 20 years..you like Marino,Nugent,Trower,Page..then give Travers a listen..the ferocity of Snortin Whiskey after 20 yrs nearly is audible and Life in London is so memorable and sad.Be wise...start collecting Pat Travers!!"
1,Not necessary,"You don't need the book or the course to become debt free. All you need is common sense. If you don't have any common sense, the book/course might help you."
5,DigiTech GNXFC foot controller,"Solid as hell!! I love it's durabilityand the freedom to record without my handsleaving my AXE!!Even though the lights never worked,the function is all there...and that is simply all I needed!!!Thanx DigiTech, for another exceptional product!!"
4,DigiTech GNXFC Foot Controller,"The product arrive on time and in good condition. Now I am using it and leds do not turn on. I am not sure if they should. Anyway, the foot controller work well and I am happy with it."
3,Eh....,"As many other reviewers have stated, Dalamar the Dark is -not- blonde. He is, in fact, a black-haired elf. It was also my understanding that he had been physically changed during his time serving the 'One God' in the War of Souls, (i.e. he was weaker, thinner, possibly even going gray. Appearing to age faster then an elf -should-.) This was not portrayed in the novel at all.The writing style was wonderful, and I enjoyed the story. But there were massive holes in it. Unfortunately, this seems to be a running theme with some of the newer Dragonlance books. (If you haven't read 'Lake of Death' yet, don't.) If you're a hardcore dragonlance fan, and want to know about the current status of High Sorcery, this book delivers. But you can definitely live without it."
4,A very good book,"It only took me a day & a half to get through this, not because it was the best DL I've ever read but because I needed to know what happend. The villian was very easy to hate & the new character, Coryn, fit right in. It also explains why the gods are so against wild magic.The only thing I didn't like was Dalamar's fate. Why did he have to be the one to be disfigured? He probably won't be nearly as charming now. And why does he get the short end of the stick all the time? When are they finally going to throw him a bone? Dalamar deserves better - he deserves to rule the world."
1,"Oh, well....","Reading this took very little time, but I have to say, I was a bit disappointed. Dalamar with blonde hair? Some of the consistency was a off and things seem to come too easily for some of the characters. The conflict between wild and robe magic was wierd. The gods were portrayed well, though."
1,not very good,"I made a comment earlier on this... but they asked me to remove it and send me more battery for it.Well, I told them I dont need more of these, because it's really won't last over 30 minutes.Am really sorry to make a bad report but it's sub-par.A battery should last long as the Canon one...this one does only half the time."
1,worst buy EVER!,"These battery's are a piece of junk. Please do no buy them. They went dead in less an month. Please go with the original canon battery's, its worth the time and money."
3,An OK battery,Battery never quite held a full charge and would run out faster than the stock bettery. I'm sure it's probably just this one and others may work better.
5,Long Lasting...worked better than I expected,I was told not to buy off brand batteries that they would not last... NOT.These batteries actually lasted longer than the Canon original pack. got to love that....Highly recommended...
4,I love Harlequin movies!!,The Harlequin movies are all very good. I enjoy watching them. They are a bit sappy but very good entertainment value for the money!!
3,More romance than sex,"Which is why this isn't a bad one. Sometimes romance is more a turn-on than sex, and this video, of a group of college grads getting together each summer for a reunion, is rich in romance, so much so that actual sex doesn't need to be shown (if you want that, go to another website). The kissing and caressing are so prevalent here that it's reassuring to watch that not all touching has to go all the way. The photography is top-notch as well, and there's none of that grainy blurriness that impairs most other productions of this type. The models here are good-looking, including the late Kristian Brooks in a rare soft-core role, and the video isn't bad for its kind."
2,Not worth it,"I'm currently a student enrolled in a class that is using this book. I bought it over the summer to prepare for the course and found it very confusing. The book is very illogical and not well written at all. The writers seem to try to find the most complicated way to express even the simplest idea. For example Newton's first law of motion is stated as ""An object at rest and an object in motion maintains its velocity unless it experiences an unbalanced force."" How much wordier can it get?The entire textbook is this way and jumps from one subject to another with almost no logical order. I would strongly suggest that anyone thinking of buying this book reconsider. There are many superior books that cover the same subjects better."
3,Needs editing,"Too many mispellings!! Needs editing. However, the content is very good. Bukofsky's book is definitely one of the best around on the subject."
3,"""Like all Indians, Kateri had dull red skin.""","That is a real sentence from this book. Be aware that it contains language that can most generously be described as ""dated"". Otherwise well done."
2,A classic textbook,"This book did not surpass my expectations for a college textbook in any sense. It is rather hard to read because it is not entertaining, but it a textbook for a general requirement in college ever supposed to be something that you just can't put down? That said this book provides adequate detail to grasp an understanding of physical sciences, although if the high school science courses that you (?) have taken were in any way advance this book will be substantially review."
1,"It's cheap, and it shows.","I bought these along with the black ones. Half the pens don't work, and the rest come out very light when I write; the writing looks like it's in pink. I wouldn't buy these again."
3,i like the compare photos and suggestions,"i like the compare photos because they explain the rules of dressing more to one's body shape without lenghthy complex paragraphs, but i found ""color me beautiful"" to be a better book when it comes to the how to's of dressing... i still recommend this book as a complement to ""color me beautiful"""
2,What Not to Bother With,"I really enjoy both the US and UK versions of this show, but I found this book really disappointing. Only one or two options are offered for each body part, and no attention is given to color, total body proportion, age, or lifestyle. All photos are of the authors, who are quite slim, so no advice is given to heavier women. The most confusing advice in the whole book is that for women with big bottoms and saddle-bags: a-line skirts are recommended for saddle bags but not big bottoms. Then the reverse advice is given for pencil skirts. Don't women who have one problem often have both? What am I supposed to do, sew the front of an a-line to the back of a pencil? Guess what? Even the photographs on both pages are of the same member of the pair...so what should she wear? No answers in this book."
5,Must have for cleaning out your closet!,I love the show on BBC America and the book does not disappoint. Even applying just a few of the great tips will go a long way in helping you look and feel better!
5,Don't listen to them...it's the best!!!,"They are the best...this book is the best...if everyone had this book, I think they'd all look and feel much better!! Watch the show as well, if you haven't!"
2,mediocre advice,"while i truly enjoy their tv show, and their appearances on oprah, trinny and susannah miss the mark when it comes to their book. some of their advice is helpful, but it would have been better had they used models other than themselves. i appreciate the message they are trying to send (no one is perfect, not even them) i just find it hard to believe that between them they have all the figure flaws that women have. it would have definitely translated better with a more diverse selection of models."
2,Contradictory,"My main complaint about this book is that most of us aren't battling just one flaw--we have at least two. So what's the person who fits to categories to do when she sees that the recomended pant leg cut is flattering for one of her shortcomings and absolutely devastating for another?The answer: Get a different book. This book only provides simplistic descriptions of clothes that work in one particular body situation, and really doesn't explain how to adapt their advice to changing fashion. You can already spot a lot of trendy clothing from last year (or before!) that one wouldn't want to be seen in now. I thought the purpose of the book was to suggest timeless dressing?There are plenty of decent books out there that may require more reading than pictures [gasp!] but that will give you much more sound advice, and will be more useful in the long run."
3,Um.... Okay,"I'm a big fan of the show ob BBC America, and I was very excited to get this book.While I enjoyed this book and agree with everyone else that it's a good start it seemed to be lacking in a lot of meat. The examples they have are so obvious one would have to be blind not to know it looks ridiculous. There are also a lot of sweeping generalizations that didn't sit well with me. It misses the chance to really overcome subtle fashion disasters and it made me realize that one fashion doesn't always have to go with one body type.Still it was intersting and entertaining to read, and I don't regret buying it."
1,Overtones,"I just do not like the tone of this book-its just too too bossy for my taste. This is a book written by the two the most 'bitchy and obnoxious' fashionistas.As Simon Cowell is to AMERICAN IDOL,these two are to FASHION."
1,What not to wear if you're skinny with a nearly perfect body,"I flipped through this book because I saw on the back cover the body areas that are covered. I'm sorry, but if you're really a woman troubled by having big ..., big arms, a big butt, a flabby tummy, saddlebags and/or thick legs, then I would NOT advise you to buy, or even to read, this book. The women who model the clothes that you should or should not wear for these body flaws have nearly ""perfect"" bodies. Let's see them write this book again and use real women, who really do struggle with trying to find the right types of clothes for they body types. Maybe women who wear over a size 10 pant and over a size medium top."
1,Total Turnoff!,"The word ""vulgar"" isn't often used about books these days, but it certainly applies to this one! The authors start with a negative viewpoint (""What NOT to Wear""), proceed to describe every possible body flaw, using the most disgusting terms possible, and then tell how women should disguise it. If you didn't hate your looks before, you surely will after you read through this book. Their models struggle to look fat and flabby at the appropriate points and succeed only in looking ridiculous. Rather than going through the agony of stuffing yourself into some clothing disguise, better to stand up straight, eat right and exercise! A turnoff from page one."
2,"Cute, but a real waste of money.","This book reads like one long beauty magazine article. Lots of pretty pictures, but not a whole lot of content. Much of the advice given is either common-sense stuff that most people can figure out from other sources, OR very much fashion-driven and reliant upon current styles (the fact that everyone seems to own capris, yet the authors seem to hate them, is just one example). On top of it all, reading this really can make just about anyone feel ""imperfect."" While much of the advice is true, it does suffer from overkill a bit. More to the point, the book just isn't worth its sale price. If it was $5 or sold as a ""special edition"" of a beauty magazine I'd feel better about spending my money on it."
3,"Far, far too brief!!!","This book does have some useful tips and I like the fact that they use photographs to demonstrate what is right and what is wrong. However, this book does not cover enough information to be a ""one-size-fits-all"" guide. Since the only models are Trinny and Susannah, you must be ultra thin or matronly in your shape for the tips to benefit you.The advice is sound, and can be applied to other body types, but the book would have been better served to use images and models from the tv show instead of limiting the book to photos of themselves."
2,Has some useful information,"Their basic facts are on the money , but their pick in clothing is dowdy and at times mis-matched. They left out no butt and skinny legs and age appropriate clothing. I would wait and by a used book like mine.:-) Thanks for listening, Chea Dukes, Atlanta"
2,Disappointing.,"I love the show ""What Not to Wear,"" so I thought I'd like this book. It's not nearly as good as the show and not even particularly interesting. Skip it."
4,Great starter book,"This was the first style guide I bought and it was salient- to the point no-nonsense type book that a fashion defunct person like myself needed. It's not the best esp. With the clothes looking outdated but for a quick reference guide, it's good. Nice book to share or pass around. Good place to start if you want to start dressing betters."
1,What Not to Wear,"A more appropriate title would be ""What Not to Read."" At most,the suggestions are elementary and in my opinion, not alwayscorrect. Visually this book is also disappointing with the authors doubling as models. This book is a definite ""don't.""Michele, Fashionista, ATL., GA"
1,Two Annoying Disasters,"I have watched these two for quite awhile and find myself, not only tiring of the endless re-runs, but of the two women advisers touching peoples' derrieres and bosoms. They are rather snobbish, not very attractive women, who lost me completely when they pushed wearing hide-tight maternity clothes that made them look like blimps, they apparently never heard of a good hair cut and finally, the hideous recommendation that you wear a dress over a pair of slacks. The posturing and face making when wearing something ""wrong"" is off-putting, silly, but not amusing.I am very glad I bought a copy from the new and used section of Amazon, I would have been quite cranky if I had paid full price."
2,Disappointing!,"Everything in this book was common sense, i.e. Don't wear what looks ugly on you! I love the show ""What Not to Wear"" and expected a lot more from this book then obvious advise like (paraphrasing) ""if you have a great set of boobs, show them off"". Also, Trinny and Robin were the models for all the dos and don'ts. They both have super figures, so for most of the don'ts they had to try and exaggerate their ""flaws"". Trinny would slouch to exaggerate her small chest and Robin would puff-out out her tummy to look larger around the middle. Give me a break! These two really don't have the body flaws that so many real women have to deal with when trying to find cloths that fit and flatter.Save your money and don't buy this book. Instead, buy yourself some good fitting undergarments. Good looks always start with a good foundation!"
3,"Just okay, not great","This is basically a picture book of trinny and susannah, and what styles work with specific body parts. I'm glad I read the reviews first, I was going to buy it new, but after reading the reviews, I bought a used copy for .01. Fun book to look through, but I wouldn't want to put out much money for it. Not much writing in it."
2,I am not buying what they are selling,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I love these kind of style advice books but this just left me feeling like I didn't learn a thing. Much of the advice was old hat, and some of it I just didn't even agree with like busty girls shouldn't wear turtlenecks - cmon! And it only addressed specific body areas rather than all over body types.For my money Stacey and Clinton's book is the way to go. Haven't found one yet to rival theirs. And I guess I just like the way they seem to find beauty in all figure types and bring it out. I know Susannah and Trinny are British but their humor sometimes just borders on sheer viciousness. Counter-productive to raising people self-esteem."
2,Not worth the money!,This book was just okay. I mean honestly it was not what I thought it would be some of the stuff they said was absolutely true but other things they made the skinny chick wear a shirt that was like an extra large when she was probably an medium at most and duh that will look frumpy. And V-necks for people with larger breasts okay but that really doesn't flatter ever larger big breasted woman some need to hide theirs because they are too big. This book is worth flipping though but not buying save your money and get a book that is worth your time and money.
2,Not what I expected,"This book did not meet my expectations. I expected a lot of advice and tips on dressing different bodies. What I got were a couple of pages on each problem type with humorously exaggerated fashion modeling by the authors. If you only have one or two major problem areas, this book is a waste of money because only a couple pages will apply to you.I would recommend any style book by Brenda Kinsel instead. She helps each reader determine how to let their true self shine through their clothing in a positive manner."
3,Definitely Style Over Substance,"This book was more entertainment than information, although I did attempt to chart the advice so that I could find commonalities that fit my eight figure flaws (and I am considered attractive, believe it or not). I would've been much more satisfied with this book if it had a chapter on pitfalls for every body and a chapter on how to work with several flaws at once. Oh, yes, and wouldn't it have been so wonderful if they had shown us exactly what a woman is supposed to wear in the summer? I still think I'm going to be a jeans and t-shirt type of gal, but at least now I will know that the jeans should be flared and the t-shirt should be sleeved, fitted, open-necked and land in the middle of my tummy. The other good point worth mentioning is that I received a lot of positive reinforcement from my loved ones who did not like the idea of me thinking in terms of my body as being flawed."
2,Aptly Titled,This book uses a clever format contrasting good and bad examples. Sometimes it's hard to understand why something (ex. shoulder pads) is wrong without seeing a more current alternative. The problem is that the so-called good examples are often equally bad. This book gets credit for imagining some truly freakish fashions. Who shows up to an interview with a knee length jacket and flared pants - unless it's for a Bea Arthur bio pic? Why criticize a dress for giving an eye-full and then laude a woman popping out of her v-neck on the preceding page and a woman sporting obvious nipples (can I say that on Amazon.com?) on the next page? This book gets an additional star for being hilarious but it's purely unintentional.
4,Better than What Not To Wear after 40,"Really enjoyed this book. Funny, provocative, practical, educational. It was helpful. Not always realistic as the body types they used (themselves) are not typical of all body types, but it was still a good indicator of what kind of clothes are appropriate and flattering in most cases."
3,"Specific, but somewhat valuable","This book focuses on several specific figure ""flaws"" and gives a patented formula for dealing with each one. The authors show some nice pictures of an example of the wrong skirt shape across from the right skirt shape, for instance; same with pants, shoes, or any item of clothing you might wear on the specific figure flaw--like a big butt, thick ankles, etc. They give you lists of options for what TO wear and what to avoid.This was a good book for addressing figure flaws but didn't make much mention of dressing appropriately for your age or choosing good colors for your complexion; and in addition I thought it could have had a chapter devoted to dressing the whole person, not just your individual body parts. OTher than that, very complete and nice photo examples."
2,You'll get far better advice elsewhere,"... from Leah Feldon, for instance (""Does this make me look fat?"" which is NOT just about ""fatness"" per se). Trinny and her pal play up the cutesy offensiveness that was a hallmark of their (creepy, I thought) show, and downplay any real substantial guidance -- which is what any of us who watch/read them are really looking for, isn't it?For sure, clothes shopping when you don't have an 'easy' body type isn't much fun -- it's hard work and the results you are aiming for can't always be achieved -- but don't add to your troubles ""arming"" yourself with such a weak guide. Again, buy Leah Feldon who doesn't play around and offers solid, timeless guidance.I gave this two starts nonetheless because, if you have money to burn, it won't kill you to add it to your shelves. It's not without any substance ... it's just weak in comparison to what's out there."
1,Might be good if you are clueless!,"The book was okay, but I get more enjoyment from a copy of Vogue. It would probably be great for a woman who has no clue how to dress for her body type. Also, they did not address every body type! They should have added no butt and long torso! I got more out of their apperance on Oprah(which is why I bought the book) than from the book."
1,Tell us something we don't know,Come on! Every 'tip' in this book was totally obvious and something everyone already knows. There were no tricks on how to dress to cover flaws that were not Duh! I know if I have fat arms not to wear short sleeves. I was very disapointed in this book.
3,"Common sense, but some women need it!","I bought this book because I wanted to make sure I was dressing right for my figure - I have more than one of the ""offending"" body parts listed in the book. This book and the information contained therein mainly confirmed that I had been dressing correctly for my figure all along! I was pleasantly surprised. There were a few extra tips that were helpful, and some of the verbiage was rather amusing so I don't consider the book a waste for myself. I have seen women who desperately need this book and I wish I could give them each a copy. Some of the other reviewers say there are better books out there - show me, show me! I would love to buy those too!"
1,wow this was terrible,"my mother bought this for me as a gift, and she completely wasted her money. this book is AWFUL. the pictures are bad, the posing is terrible-- if you slouch and frown, you''ll look bad no matter what you're wearing! They should have used models who actually HAD saddlebags or flat chests or flabby tummies... maybe they just wanted to see their faces in print.I cannot even express how awful this book was. I agree with one other reviewer-- I get MUCH more out of a copy of Vogue than I ever would from this book. And at a fraction of the cost..."
5,"I went from ""you look nice,"" to ""wow! va va voom!""","I have to say, no one had ever accused me of not ""looking nice"" or at least putting in the effort to look nice. I always tried my best, but wasn't quite getting it right. But after I started following Trinny and Susanna's tips, the compliments really stepped up a notch. Seriously. I have a cute figure, but no one really noticed. I wore the wrong clothes for my body type. Now I get CONSTANT compliments, even though I haven't lost weight or had plastic surgery. I've been in this body a long time but no one really noticed my figure until I followed their advice.(My only critique is that they use themselves as models for body type problems they don't actually have.)I also find I buy FEWER clothes than before because I know before I buy something whether its going to work for me. I can look at something on the hanger and know if its going to look great or horrible."
2,Have a real body? Skip this book.,"If you have wide hips, big thighs, or narrow shoulders, which are some of the most common body issues women have, you will find this book useless: these issues are not even mentioned. You'll also get no help if you have a combination of issues - like both a ""big butt"" and ""no boobs"", as the authors describe them - because what you should wear to hide one problem might accentuate another. The fun approach and decent explanations of the issues that they do address can't make up for not addressing some major points."
3,"Ok, but could be a lot better...","This book is ok, but not as great as i'd hoped. I, too, saw the women on Oprah but even then, thought their fashion advice was obvious (the women who wore the ""mom"" jeans was in definite need of an update -- ANYONE could have made her over!)Also, i wish they both would have posed a little better for the ""before"" pics -- anyone looks bad when you stand like they did and make faces. I'm sure they were just trying to be funny, but to me, it all depends on how you carry yourself, no matter what you wear.I think Suzanne is a great model for the problems they address for her body type, but Trinny just has too good a body for any ""flaws"" (except, of course for her very tiny boobs -- or should i say mosquito bites?!) She would probably look good in anything. They need real women to model the do's and don'ts for this book to make it more helpful."
2,What a Joke!,"I was so disappointed when I received this book. I had hoped it would give me solid guidelines on what to wear for my figure shape, etc. Instead all it contained were pictures of Trinny and Susannah modeling their figure flaws and tooting their own horns. Big deal. The commentary from both these women was critical and negative. We're not all built like supermodels and yes, some of us do have big upperarms, big thighs,wide hips and boobs. Why not concentrate on camouflaging these flaws and offering positive helpful suggestions on how to make one look their best instead of tearing ourselves down."
2,This book is only part of the story,"I saw this book in a store at the Atlanta airport and thought wow this sounds great.Boy, was I glad I took a good look at it before I purchased it. I quickly saw that it wouldn't help me much, I have a big butt and saddlebags - one problem needs an A-line skirt and the other a pencil skirt. What do I do, wear both? Seems to me that many people who have saddle bags also have a larger butt. I concluded that I would be better off to take a friend to a store, and try on many styles to see what looks good, rather than spend $15 for this book.All the clothing was solid colors, no information was included about the effect of prints, design interest, etc. I am sure there are more useful books."
4,A Pureed Soup With A Nice Flavor,"This soup is a pureed bean soup with a nice flavor that does, however, need a little help with some added spices."
3,Very difficult,"I bought this item to recover from smoking and to help with my asthma. I got the item in the mail and even on the lowest settings I can barely pull air in. I went to the website to read about difficult inhalation and apparently it is a very prevalent problem because the muscles to inhale are quite weak.I think this product has some merit and I will stick with it. However, unless you are an advid runner I would get the level lower because you cannot return this item"
3,This Could Have Been Much Better,"My favorite songs on this DVD are Leslie Gore singing ""It's My Party"", ""Five O'clock World by The Vogues, ""A Lover's Concerto"" by The Toys, ""1-2-3"" by Len Barry, ""Good Lovin"" by The Young Rascals, ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'"" by Nancy Sinatra, ""Silhouettes"" by Herman's Hermits, ""I Got You, Babe"" by Sonny & Cher and ""Do the Freddie"" by Freddie and The Dreamers. To a lesser degree I also enjoyed ""You're Adorable"" by The Dixie Cups (""Chapel of Love"" would have been better) and ""Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows"" by Leslie Gore. The Turtles, The Everly Brothers, and The Association also sing but don't look for a hit song from any of them. All but one song are shown in glorious black and white, but the picture isn't so hot throughout the DVD."
1,Crappy book,Do not waste your money on this garbage.A very poor read on a very authentic subject.I am amazed that this man actually found a publisher.Glad i did not have to pay for this book out of my own pocket.The illustrator for this book has publicly gone on record to say that all the pictures in the book were fabricated by Kal Korff who never had access to the real photographs and nor did he meet Billy Meier.He has never been to Switzerland.Because the pictures were deliberately tampered with by Korff 'debunking' became easy.The Billy Meiers case is a very serious subject and there are very good books out there.Avoid this one like the plague.
1,Another BS book by Kal,If you believe Kal and this book then you still believe that the world is flat!
1,Objective my hole..,"Any investigation into a subject that fabricates evidence as Mr Karl Korf has to back up his vitriolic attacks should be viewed as highy suspect. Avoid or at least do some research on Mr Korf before purchasing or reading this crap. I suggest having a look at the website ""Karl is an idiot"" for further information, it is interesting reading and more factually based in my opinion than this book."
1,"Poorly Researched, Or Has An Agenda!","This is one of the worst researched books on the Billy Meier UFO Case I have ever read. In fact this book is so bad that I have to wonder if it was a deliberate attempt at character assassination. Anyone mildly familiar with the Billy Meier case can easily see how poorly researched this book is. So many facts are wrong that it would take an entire book to correct them. If you are interested in the true facts of this case I recommend you read ""LIGHT YEARS"" By Gary Kinder, ""UFO CONTACT FROM THE PLEIADES"" by Wendell Stevens or the new book ""AND YET THEY FLY"" by Guido Moosbrugger. Any of these books are far superior to this book!"
2,"Fireplace scene is good, but overall DVD is disappointing.","The fireplace scene is good, but that's about it. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I wasn't impressed with the other views. Many of the images (like the fireworks, trees in the ocean scene, leaves in the autumn scene) are computer renderings that do not look real."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to receiving this DVD because of the variety it offered, but I am pretty disappointed with it. Most of the scenes are fake-looking, and the music is cheesy. The fish is just a fish against a white background -- boring. It seems like they could have put so much more into this but it just falls short."
4,Great for sleeping,"My husband and I purchased this to have something on the TV while we sleep. We don't turn up the volume, so the DVD sounds aren't an issue. We've tried putting on ocean documentaries and space documentaries on Netflix, but once they're over, you wake up to the Netflix screen which is anything but relaxing. This DVD is a perfect match to have on while resting, and I would recommend it to others who prefer having the TV on while they sleep."
2,Fun View,Not very good quality. The scenes look like a photograph with dubbed on graphics. Some of the clips feature a washing machine and a pizza in a microwave going round!!!!!!!! I would not recommend it
3,"OK for me, great for my cat...","I bought this ambiance DVD over others because it had so many different scenes to pick from. Mainly I just wanted the fireplace though. Once I got it, the fireplace was nice (no music or anything to distract from the natural burning sounds). Very realistic. My cat loves the goldfish scene; the snow scene (with or without the multi-colored lights) was also nice. I can't really see myself watching any of the others though. Only 2 (the fire & fish) were real-life. The rest of the images were computer-generated, although of very good quality. The party-type scenes (disco balls, etc.) are rather obnoxious, music and all.Scenes included:Fireplace, Goldfish, Pizza in a microwave, Clothes in a dryer, Disco balls, Psychodelic abstract images, snow-falling scene with & without colored twinkle lights, autumn leaves falling, etc. There's something for every season."
4,"GREAT game, but not enough of it","This is is the best DVD game we've played since the Scene It! series came out. The questions and categories cover a great range, making it terrific even for players of varying ages who may best remember things from different eras/genres.The graphics are far better than any other DVD game of late, the hosting not overly cheesy, and unlike other games of its kind, keeps score for you! No rolling of dice or moving pawn pieces on a board needed--just pop in the DVD and play!The only problem is that there isn't much of it. Each DVD contains only 3 games each! I can't figure why they would include so very little content, and there aren't that many volumes of each category (TV, music, movies, etc). It's a letdown for such a fun game."
1,gift items,"The recipriants of these gifts were happy, but I have not heard any feedback as to how they liked them after viewing the discs."
2,Fun View TV DVD,I was hoping for more from this DVD. I guess I should have checked it out a little more before my purchase. I was going to give it as a Christmas gift. I don't like it well enough to do that.Wasn't near the quality that I had hoped for.
4,"Like it says, Fun !","This disc is great to have on in the background at parties. We bought it for the log fire for our Christmas party, but the other sections are good too. When we played the ""fish tank"" section, it's the first time I have ever seen our cat take notice of the TV screen - she was transfixed!"
2,Too hard to be fun,"I bought this DVD after reading the other reviews. I love step aerobics and have been doing it at gyms and at home for over 20 years. Even though I like a fast pace, alot of chorography and good music, this video is just too much. By the time you figure out a move you're on to the next one. Christi talks so fast and the music is so loud you can hardly understand what she is trying to say. She often goes into the advanced/optional part of a move before you have a chance to feel comfortable with the basic move. Even if you try the review at the end of the DVD she doesn't slow it down enough for you to get any real practice in. I tried it several times before I ended up using my old favs again."
5,Another great Christi,"Yes...it is a tricky one to master, but if you take the time to do it - you will have SO much fun working out. I made it my goal to get this routine down, and I look forward to my morning workout with Christi. I highly recommend any Christi Taylor."
5,"Fun, encouraging, motivating!","Christi teaches cheerfully without being annoying and is a delight to watch and learn from. The steps are creative and fun and keep your interest so that you can think more about the moves and not about how much you are working out! I found the MoveMaster section invaluable while I was learning the steps. It greatly increased my enjoyment of the workout. Thanks for a great workout, Christi!"
3,Step Video,"This purchase was received as described, good quality, well packaged, very timely, and I would purchase from this seller again! This is an extremely difficult video however and I have done step for 16 years."
5,A gem of musical brilliance!,"This album is a marvellous work of art! Although I've been a big fan of their music since the early 80s, this is definitely among their best albums. Building on previous roots, but looking forward into the future, they've made songs that are very catchy and very modern. Great music for a variety of purposes...to relax, dance, or to stimulate the brain waves and get inspiration while working! I also love the instrumentals, as they highlight how novel sounds can merge together in a beautiful melody!This is an album that hasn't received the wide attention that it deserves....perhaps because it's ahead of it's time?Anyways, this is an album I strongly recommend! You won't get tired of it....believe me, I've been listening to it at least once a week for the past 2 years."
4,Welcome back !!,"Hooray! The Human League are back.This is the first newly released CD that I've bought for a long time and I wasn't disappointed.It's worth buying it just for 'All I ever wanted' - a classic HL track. Hearing it for the first time brought back happy memories of 1981 and 'Don't you want me?'. Both are great, unpretentious pop songs.Another great track is 'Love me madly?' but what lets the album down for me is the number of instrumental tracks (7). It's not that they aren't any good, it just makes the album somewhat disjointed. Especially as after every vocal track comes an instrumental one. Just program your CD to play the vocal tracks first....To conclude, if you like the Human League you'll love this. It's got a retro feel to it without being stuck in an 80's time warp.Proper pop songs by proper pop stars. Welcome back!"
5,Better than Dare?,I've always liked the Human League and have always bought every album as soon as it's released. I did the same with this album but I cannot believe how incredible it is. I loved the earlier albums (Reproduction and Travelogue) although I first discovered these in the Eighties when I bought Dare. This album has the best of all three albums thrown into one glorious concoction. It's great. Buy it.
1,"Sorry, I wanted to love it, but.....","For about 1 minute in the middle of Never Give Your Heart, The Human League I remembered peeked out and I started to enjoy. Then the counterpoint became too loud, and ended up being shouted. I bought this album sight unseen, because I wanted to like it. I liked Human League's earlier albums. By and large, though, this coaster is a bit of a stinker. I read the other reviews and relistened to the CD, just to be sure. Come on League, I know you can do better. I'll still buy the next one- try again."
4,Regretfully Overlooked... 2001 is like 1981,"After the Human League issued the great ""back to basics"" album ""Octupus"" in 1995, they took 6 years to follow up with ""Secrets"", which is as close as ever the League have come to their pinnacle album ""Dare!"", issued in 1981.""Secrets"" covers 16 songs in 51 min., 9 ""real"" tracks with 7 short instrumentals interwoven. The leadoff track (also the 1st single) is ""All I Ever Wanted"", with an instantly likeable hook reminiscent of old times. ""Secrets"" has primarily upbeat tracks, thankfully leaving ""ballads"" to a mimimum (only one, really, ""Never Give Your Heart""). The best track is ""Reflections"", a 6+ min. blowout of funk techno pure danceable fun, check out the 2 min. outro, just great! The short instrumentals are quite fun, and flow well within the overall sound of the album.The album has not gotten a lot of attention in the US. But for the League fans, this album is a great treat. 2001 is like 1981!"
4,Fun electronica,"The lyrics are not epic, but the music is fun, and they sound great. Lots of catchy tunes, fun to just play loud and sing along to. Recommended."
4,Hymns For The Nation,This cd is really good but some of the hymns are not exactly on point. I really dont like when people take the hymns and change them even a little. Most of the songs are good and are done the traditional way and I enjoy all of them that are keeping with the tradition. I would recommend this cd and think that it is a blessing to own.
1,"Very small for a large, very thin material","Pros: CheapCons: Material of shirt is extremely thin and delicate appearing, Shirt is nominally a Large but much smaller than other equivalent Large, I suggest buying one size larger than you normally would for a cheap t-shirt."
4,Very nice,"This is very comfortable shirt, I like the design but it's a bit pricy still. But overall, I like it and may order more in the future."
4,perfect item,The item i got is an item that is red and is a very good item. It is an item i will cherish for hours. This item is fantastic however this item took forever to ship
3,Product photography is a bit off...,"I ordered the deep red expecting the dark, slightly purple color from the image. Instead, it's a vibrant bright red. It's still a good product, but when advertising items with multiple colors, a product photographer should be using a color correction card to give an accurate expectation to the customer. It wouldn't have been a big deal, except it's for a costume, and the bright red doesn't look right with the rest of it. Check the image I posted to see what I mean."
4,Undersized?,"I have a few of these. The colors stay fast in my HE washer with Woolite detergent, the s***s are a bit lightweight (5.2oz) but seem to be well made. My only complaint would be that they seem to be a big small, especially right around my midsection."
1,dissapointment,"The material was not as heavy as I expected, my fault. The red printed label on the back ran when it was washed for the first time, and now I have a pink collar, hanes fault."
2,"Wow, they really shrank!","When I opened the package, the shirts were way too big for me.I was glad because I suspected they would shrink, but not that much!Now they're too small for me. Basically went form a large to a small.Other than that they're pretty ordinary t shirts."
3,Like everything new,"Like everything new, this album takes a bit of getting used to. The first time I heard it, I hated it. The second time I heard it, I hated it less. Now, it's one of those albums that I can put on once in a while when I'm ""in the mood.""People are quick to praise this album as being a precursor to techno and trance. I would agree: it's definitely light years ahead of its time. But it's certainly not as beautiful as ""In a Silent Way"" or as adventurous as ""Bitches Brew"".I think, like everything new that Miles was experimenting with, this album doesn't quite settle in or feel comfortable with itself. And me, I haven't ever quite felt comfortable with it."
4,A great soundscape,"This is not music, this is a soundscape. Although it may sound a little bit old fashioned to today's ears, I think it's a great soundscape after all."
4,Miles eléctrico,En esta grabación está Miles lleno de instrumentos elctrónicos. Es música llena de muy buen ritmo para bailar el jazz. Un coleccionista debe tenerla.
2,"worth a listen, but that's about it","Originally released in 1972, this record has been hailed by some as a precursor to hip-hop, trance, jungle, and a host of other currently fashionable musical styles. To these ears, it's a repetitive mess that never gets off the ground. Davis' trumpet is buried in the mix, and there's no real melody to speak of either. The best track on the album is ""Black Satin,"" a cut that Bill Laswell remixed with superior results on the excellent Panthalassa CD in 1998. The sound quality on that album was far superior, and the song worked much better within the context of that CD. Here, it just serves as the theme for the last half hour of the disc. On a historical note, this was the first Miles album to utilize overdubs and multiple tape machines."
1,absolute junk,Jazz purists please avoid this title and stop with nefertiti or Miles in the Sky...You will be very happy that you didn't waste your money like I did. This cd got traded in to the used department so quickly out of my collection. I wouldn't even call it fusion let alone good funk.
1,Same reasons of Louis and Art,"Louis Armstrong and Art Blakey, both recognized that MELODY is an important part of music, Louis stayed away from improvisational mess while Art Blakey enforced Hard-bop as a new way of conciling Freedom and Melody. Even though I love FUNK,I'm sorry I bought this CD, I guess I'll give it away to some trance DJ.On the label of my copy there's a sticker that reads:""JAZZ MASTERPIECE"" (ha,ha!)I guess I would have taken the word ""JAZZ"" out and replaced it by ""EXPERIMENTAL"".Buying Jeff Corber CD will be a more truly fusion idea, while Wynton Marsallis would be a good choice if you want to hear some jazz trumpet."
1,Please remove it from jazz-funk essentials...,It's probably the worst thing Miles has ever made. It's TERRIBLY BORING! On the corner has no sense from the beginning to the end.
4,Prescient Miles,"This album's flawed no doubt and can get a bit over-indulgent but this is Jazz Funk for the new millennium. It was ahead of its time when it was first issued in 1972. It still is.No one anticipated musical trends better than Miles and this albums is proof. His underlying use of of Indian motifs, raw funk grooves and corruscating electronica prefigured everything from Shakti and Weather Report (post Mysterious Traveller)to Trilok Gurtu's eclectic blend and acid jazz.It may not be a landmark like Bitches Brew but this is essential to understand where Miles and Jazz was headed."
4,Take a deep breath...,"...before you start listening. Because from note 1 this recording drops you in the middle of an intense, funky musical experiement unlike anything made before it. It ebbs and flows, with stellar performances from all players, but it doesn't let up in intensity for the entire length of the disc. This is not background music. The best experience of this disc is had by listening to it loud and uninterrupted. Also with an open mind. Anathema to jazz purists, On the Corner should delight and challenge those with funkier predilections."
5,The Most Underrated of his work,"This album is scathingly ironic because it was received coldly by the public, and was out of print for quite a while which is absolutely blasphemous and obscene considering the incredible explosion of energy within this pulsating piece of euphoric musical genius. I can not think of too many other examples of musical masterpieces that broke tradition and reestablished the art form. If this album is not in your collection of Miles then you do not know his music."
2,Idk,This Maca root made me break out and gassy.... I was gaining a little weight but so many breakouts... Maybe I shouldn't of started the dosages in smaller amounts then gradual increased I started off with six. My hormones were proably in a frenzy
4,Very fun and Educational Video!!,This Barney Video was very fun to watch and all my kids got to learn alittle bit about space also. They wanted to go to the library the next day to find space books... This Video also has wonderful songs that children love to sing and dance to. Great Video.
3,"Not the best of the Barneys, but okay","This video is not bad by Barney standards, but I don't think it holds up to the other Barneys. The highlight is a special visit from a real astronaut. A lot of misinformation about outer space. Songs and dance numbers are not up to speed with other Barney videos like Imagination Island."
5,I love that red satin space suit,"As a cast member of the show Barney And Friends, I'd have to say this is probably one of the best Barney films ever made, not to mention one of the most entertaining to sit through. My cousin has this movie cited by memory, and its adorable to watch him dance around like a lunatic and staring in awe at the effects and ""pretty colors"". If you're looking for a video to watch with your kids over and over again, look no further."
4,My grandaughter loves this movie!,"When my two year-old grandaughter visits, she always asks for the Barney ""face"" movie. She loves the colorful scenery and especially the little girl Barney and kids visit on the other planet. The songs are catchy and I find myself watching alongside her and singing along. The rocket and and planets are very imaginative, but a real astronaut visits the rocket and shows a clip of real outer space events. I highly recommend this movie, especially for preschoolers."
4,NA Tour,"At first listen, ""Apart"" is a very infectious song. Elkland will be on tour with ERASURE this spring in NA. Definately a 1,2 punch!"
5,Butterfly Ring,The ring is even more beautiful in person. It gets alot of attention when I wear it. Everyone wants to try it on. Great buy!
4,Beautiful Ring,"This ring is so pretty and sturdy, I bought it for my pinky which its a bit bulky for everyday wear for me so I wear it out! Worth the price for sure!!"
1,do not buy!!!,"don't waste your money. i am a huge cowboy fan and when i saw this in the store i bought it without hesitation. i couldn't wait to get home and watch a recap of one of the best season they have had in a long time. well the whole dvd is 22 minutes long. take out the extra stuff and they spend less than a minute a game. i was so disappointed. maybe in the future the nfl will get it right and release whole seasons on dvd, but for now it is not worth the $9."
2,Only Touches on a Few Places,I picked up this book with higher hopes than it delivered. I was expecting a guide book to all the eccentric festivals and weird places to see and take photographs of but Eccentric America definitely is not that. Whilst the book goes into depth with a lot of festivals the author doesn't put the same effort into attractions with sparse detail on the little number of places actually listed. I've extensively backpacked the USA and most of the weird attractions I came across are not even mentioned here. There is also a severe lack of photographs. Obviously the author attended a car show somewhere because that's what the majority of the six photograph pages are of. You'll find more eccentric attractions in the normal USA travel guide books than in here.
5,Good,This would be the fourth time I have bought this album throughout the years! This is some of Frankie Bones best work!
2,Not what I was expecting,"While the quality of this mat are perfect for what I wanted it for, the size and placement of the ""wood planks"" leave me feeling like the photo is incredibly misleading. I was expecting something much larger. Even though size is accurate in the description, the photo is not the same product that you will get, It's more like half the size."
4,Mirrors are Fun,"My baby quite likes this toy. Even at 9 mo, she likes to open it up and see herself in the mirrors. When she was younger, she really liked the jingly black and white feet. I never really attached it to anything because it is quite large and the loop at the top is weird. Plus when it's hanging, the face doesn't like to stay closed. Other than that, a pretty good toy."
4,Love it!,"I truly enjoy this toy with our daughter who is 3 months. She is still a little young to enjoy it as she will in a few months. It has many different textures, colors and noises (the head squeaks, the body jingles, feet rattle) and I can't wait for her to explore it!"
3,"Fun, friendly, perfect for tossing - and way OVERPRICED!","I admit that my son LOVED this toy. He tugged it, tossed it, chewed it, slobbered it and giggled at it as it jingled. It suited him like his diaper at the time: perfectly.The price of it was ridiculously high considering what it is. They need to make it 10 bucks to make it worth the price though. Especially given that it's designed for someone with the attention span of a flea. You could give them a bottle filled with change and get as much excitement sometimes.I'd put it in the 6 - 9 month age frame. Or up to a year old if they are bored with trying to color on your walls. In other words, there are worse toys. And better. This one does the job but in a down economy - it's also more money then you really need to spend to entertain a baby."
2,Triumph of Egoism over Science,"A big disappointment! Roger Lewin essentially provides a book report of the most significant controversies in paleoanthropological history with very little original insight. The result is a tedious review (especially the 78 pages discussing the KBS Tuft Controversy) of the seamy side of paleoanthropology. The recurrent theme is that of entrenched preconceptions - both professional and personnal - so dominating the actions of the foremost paleoanthropologists that they ignore the preponderence of evidence in favor of their own agendas. The book is replete with examples of the petty jealosies and egoism of the foremost names in paleoanthropology triumphing over a dedication for the search for the truth. With this book, Mr Lewin escapes the threat of becoming embroilled in the jealosies and controversies of other benchmark works as he provides nothing original to attack."
2,dimensions,"Don't think I'd order a laptop cooler whenthe discription of the product doesn't tell youwhat size it is. C'mon, online shopping is hardenough, at least tell us the dimensions of the thing."
2,"It's cheesy, but it has it's moments","It's a Brit B movie that was made on a shoestring budget. That being said the movie is an absolute must for guys who have a thing for Broomhandle Mauser pistols. The plot is lame and the ultra low budget shows, but the final gun battle at the end between the two spies was so good it should have been put in a better movie!"
4,San Francisco and Northern California,I always use this series of books for my travels. They couldn't be more helpful. I felt this one was a little light on the Northern California information.... Perhaps that is all there is. I'll have an idea after my trip.
1,font too small,"The 2010 edition has incredibly small font for the text -- I can only read it at my desk with bright light. I guess this is their trade-off for including lots of photos, maps, diagrams, etc. If I had looked at this book in a bookstore I would not have purchased it for this reason -- makes it really useless for a ""walking around"" reference while in San Francisco. Not recommended unless you have excellent vision!"
2,Somewhat informative; busy layout not conducive to quick reference,"I bought this book for a 4-day trip and needed an easy to use guide book, but it was a bit outdated (restaurants listings were not correct) and sight-seeing tips were boring and/or half-heartedly written.I liked the Eyewitness book for Tokyo, which had a light overview with useful pictures and maps. It complemented a Frommers book well, which had lots of useful information, but required more reading to get a good idea of a neighborhood. I think this book would also benefit from another, more well-informed book, as this one lacked the in-depth details on a particular sight.The layout was also very busy and distracting. A better layout, perhaps with selective use of color, would have been easier to navigate."
2,least favorite,Too many pretty pictures and not enough information to really understand the essence of San Francisco. I didn't think this book was worth the money.
3,Degree Of Difficulty?,"Ok, I'm a Tony Ward fan. This edition of Ward's work pushes the edge in terms of content as well as his technical skill. However, I give this book a 3-star rating due to its single focus subject matter with an inherent, built-in factor - sex - which guarantees a certain amount of patronage. Ward, if he can be categorized, is a seminal pop artist struggling with anachronistic approaches to a subject matter which, today, has been overdone to the point of numbness. Ward's images, to his credit, are still fun to examine as staged fantasies. Perhaps in a world of reality-driven entertainment Tony Ward may have found a secondary fissure to incubate a pop art clone that is capable of inciting more people to the gallery instead of the bedroom tv."
3,Maybe,"Taking as recommended on bottle and from research about use for wt loss. Not sure if this is really working, although I am aware that I feel full sooner at meals and don't feel the need for snacking between meals. Worth trying is all I can say."
4,Great bag,"This is a great bag. It is mabybe a little bigger than I thought it was going to be, but still a very cool bag."
3,There Are More Up to Date Books,"This is an adequate review of the topic, but to get more up to date details I would suggest a newer book. I did find that I wanted more background detail at times. I would have also liked more details of what was taking place in the White House. Overall, not a bad book, but I wish I had spent the time with something more up to date."
4,Barney makes learning to count fun.,"I bought this movie for my 21 month old daughter and she loves it. She was able to count to three before and now she's learning fun songs and can count to five, all on her own and with the songs. I think this movie is great for parents wanting to help their kids count.Barney makes learning to count fun!"
3,"Baby Bop makes a number 2, and other delights","This is a cute video. My son is a little young for it to hold his attention the whole way through, but he enjoys the singing and dancing a lot.It should be said that the title and packaging are a bit misleading. It's not really about counting. Rather, there's an actual storyline involving a Mary Poppins type character named Stella losing her clock numbers in her travels. Barney and his pals help search for them, ending up at the library. There, they read books and act them out as characters in the stories. It's much more a plug for reading than for math, but it is fun.I was pleasantly surprised at my son's enjoyment of the video. He likes the Spanish track, too. Fine for the little ones in the house."
5,Time For Counting,"Highly recommend this outstanding Barney video! Extremely high production values, terrific costuming, great songs and choreography, wonderful stories and fables. One of the better we've seen. Currently tops on our ""Best of Barney"" list. Always holds our toddler's interest."
4,Barney!!!,My 3 year old got this as gift for her 2nd birhtday and at 1st she didn't like it but after about 6 months she loves it and asks for it EVERYDAY!!
3,A bit dissapointed.....,"I should have researched the reviews a bit more because Parents are always honest ! It is a bit misleading as counting isn't the main theme of this dvd. I was expecting a little more interactive number counting, like showing the numbers on the screen as you see on the front of the dvd with the large print #'s. The costumes of the characters are entertaining as are the songs and the library scene. I rated this dvd 3 stars because I felt like there could have been more emphasis on the actual learning of numbers and counting....I seemed as though this was just touched on a bit."
3,Charming but overproduced,"I discovered the Rankin Sisters on YouTube when researching the Gaelic Christmas song ""Taladh Chriosda"" and absolutely fell in love with their television performance of the song. Sadly, that video is no longer available. I purchased the album to have a permanent copy, and have to say I was a little disappointed. Although their singing is lovely, it's not well served by the heavy, overproduced instrumentation. Part of what makes the Rankins' singing enjoyable is the folksy interplay of voices, and that just seemed to be drowned out. I'd have preferred an a cappella recording, or a leaner accompaniment on traditional instruments like an unamplified fiddle or harp. Instead, the result is a bit like a muzak version... fine, but not hauntingly lovely as when I first heard them."
5,Great music,THis CD is awesome...I had heard it while traveling in Canada and just had to buy it when I got home.....
3,Potential bait and switch,"I ordered these and got them just fine. However, I recently ordered another item supposedly a set of six. I got one plate and when I inquired, I was told it was a ""description error"" and I could get a credit if I wanted to return it. This is a ""bait and switch"" tactic that is rewarded when you don't return the item. So, order the ""set of 6"" at your own peril, and be prepared to have to go through the hassle of sending it back for a credit when they want to charge you the whole price for just 1."
3,Hawaiian Phrase Book (Hawaiian Classic Reprints)by J. H. Soper,"The book contains phrases that can be applied in many instances: work related (mostly rural), family related, business/negotiations (of old times), food, grocery items, covering several aspects of daily life situations, but the way it is organized it makes it hard to find a subject or a phrase to use in certain occasion/situation for instance greetings, salutations, health issues, making friends, etc....the only way to learn some hawaiian is reading the book from beggining to end (not very practical to use as a glossary of terms)"
5,Hilarious and Informative,"This book which is perfect for the coffee table, kitchen, or bathroom is a funny and revealing compendium of people, places, and oddities in the State of Tennessee. If you can't find at least one selection that either makes you laugh, guffaw, or go ""you gotta be kidding"", then you need counseling or just don't get it. Great little book that even adolescents will find funny and amazing."
4,Great voices!!,"Over here in The Netherlands nearly nobody knows people like Vince Gill and Martina McBride. What a bloody shame that is!When Vince Gill is singing Go Rest High On that Mountain with Allison Krauss and Ricky Scaggs the world stops turning for me. I nearly can't imagine that there are people in the world who wouldn't love this song. I simply get tears in my eyes. Vince is for me by far the best country vocalist on this planet.And how awesome are Martina McBrides' both songs. For me she's the huge queen of country female singers. With power and passion she sings, just awesome. What a pity she doesn't sing a duet with Vince, a missed chance!It's a pity that there are some singers who shouldn't perform on this dvd, but what the heck, YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO BUY IT!!"
4,Grand Ole Opry at Carnegie Hall,"Very well done, very tasteful, and I really enjoyed the presentation. Would recommend this to anybody."
4,Nice but little dated,Great images but the pictures needs to be updated. The older images is a little disappointing but still represents the overall area of hte national parks.
3,Brother PT-1650 Lebel Printer,"Overall this is a versatile label printer with quite a few different types of label materials available. I was able to purchase label refills at Costco at a substantial savings over those advertised on the internet. My only complaint with this label printer is that each time you print a label, the machine advances the label a bit and tells you to cut it. Then it prints the label and you cut the label off. Each time you print a label, you are cutting off (wasting) about 3/4"" of label. This seems a bit wasteful, especially on short labels."
4,Portable and Easy to Use,"The only reason this P-Touch didn't get 5 stars is because it wastes label tape every time you print one. I knew this before I bought it, however, and am still happy with the purchase."
1,Basic information available elsewhere,A thin--very thin--takedown manual for the Glock. It doesn't offer any substantial information on how the components impact the gun's functioning. The same procedures on disassembly and reassembly are available as incidental information in numerous other publications about the Glock pistol.
1,Complete rip off,"Book appears to be copied on a copy machine and then bound with a cheap binding. Not a professional published book. Save your money. The information can be found by researching on the internet. Again, complete RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!"
1,Book Review,I purchased the manual but it is not worth the money. The seller sent it on time and price was good but it is not worth the money I paid for it. Don't waste your time.
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"The manual does have the information promised, but I was heartily disappointed with the quality of the book itself. As previously mentioned the paper stock is low quality and will not hold up to being thumbed through or having any contact with cleaning solvents or powder. If you have not purchased yet, I would keep looking.All the best,Jay"
5,love it,"Really like this author keeps you reading. never would have guessed the ending, I thought I had it all figured out and was wrong."
4,Exciting!,"Possibly the best thriller I have read in a long time. Very well planned plot and the characters were believable. Descriptions of characters' dress, mannerisms and speech created brilliant word pictures for the reader. The tension build up towards the end of the book had me sitting on the edge of my seat. A surprise ending."
3,next victim,"All is books are worth a read. Racy from the start to finish.. Never disappointing .It is a easy book to get through ,and after reading this you will look forward to the next of his books."
4,Great book,"Thrilling book. I enjoyed the twists and turns. I don't like Tess as much as Abby, but it's always nice to read a book with a female kicking ass :)"
5,This strong character based book will keep you surprised!,"Michael Prescott Has gone and done it, he surprised me with the Identity of the killer. I found that the lead Female character to be smart, witty, and strong. and the support characters helped her fulfill my need for her to be all she should be. The timing of the book fits with all that is going on in our world today and the Story keeps you turning the page till the very end.. so Thanks Micheal keep it up!"
3,Good ol' classic,This is a classic I remember from my childhood. It was originally published through the Parents Magazine Press in the 1970's. It is a sweet story of a dog who is feeling neglected in the company of newly hatched chicks. His friends from the pond package him in a giant paper mache' egg. It is a great tale of cooperation and unconditional love. I probably enjoy it so much because just looking at the illustrations sends me back to my childhood.
5,Awesome warm product,Used as a base layer for the GoRuck Challenge in 15-25 degree weather over 13+ hours...I had these and a pair of REI nylon waterproof pants over them...stayed dry and warm all night/ day long!
2,Not midweight,"These are not what you want in cold weather. they are not mid weight, they are light weight. You can watch TV through a single layer. Much thinner than a quality T shirt. They fit well and look good but I wore them under my uniform on a 45 degree day and could not tell that they helped at all. I bought several of the tops and bottoms but they are of little use."
2,Minus33 bottoms,"These were pricey & I would have expected more for the price I paid. They are warm, they are soft, they are a little thin but no thinner than other brands of mid weight wool thermal underwear. My problem with them is that they have developed what appears to be moth holes in the tops & bottoms. The top was worse than the bottoms but the bottoms have several holes which began appearing after the first wash & every time I wash them (hand wash) they have more holes.If they were manufactured with better quality control & were thicker I would definitely be in love. But alas the hole issue is too much to bear with a product of this price."
1,Essential Apparel could not complete order,Essential Apparel was selling this item on sale but placed it on back order and canceled at the same time. Selling items you do not have in stock is bad business.
4,"Good to see what ""Live In Europe"" looked like.","Tina has incredible energy, blasting out 13 great show-stopping numbers without missing a beat. I thought her performance on ""Let's Stay Together"" and ""Help"" were fine; not as good as her latest DVD ""One Last Time In Concert"" On that show, her voice is the best its ever been.My complaint is: Why do they edit out the show? I mean, I pay twenty something odd dollars to get half the show? Where's the rest of it. I thought when they put it on DVD they'd give the whole thing, but I guess not. The same thing with her live record. Half of its Private Dancer tour, the other Break Every Rule. For curiosity's sake, does anybody know the original set list for this show? Where does Nutbush City Limits go in the running order, and does she do the haunting ballad ""Girls?"""
5,tina at her best,"awesome concert with Tina at her best. Featuring her best songs, from Proud Mary, Private Dancer, To her Break Every Rule albums. Only major negative is that they show the ending credits, half way through the song Paradise Is Here"
4,Tina Live on a very hot night in Rio...,"This concert was taped in January 1988 in front of a record breaking crowd of 180 000 fans. The director did not such a good job on this release, but we get to see Tina in full action. She looks exhausted at the end of the show and this proves she is the hardest working lady in show business. The sound on this dvd is not as polished as on other Turner releases and I find that the charm of this release. After all, Tina is not Celine Dion...We like it NICE AND ROUGH ! No five stars because they edited this show and cut out some of her greatest songs including her autobiographical ""Nutbush City Limits"". A must for every Tina Turner fan !"
2,BEWARE,I love the show BUT am very disappointed why they only packaged 8 episodes. Last season they had every episode. Not right but I'm the dope for being taken in and not reading carefully. Buyer Beware!
5,Great pickin',Great for anyone into collecting-Frank and Mike travel all over the country looking for what others think as junk and make their living doing this. Great show!
1,I feel duped,I pre-ordered thinking I was going to get the complete season two after buying and enjoying season One. They are fun shows. This will be the last money they get from me. Looks like much of season two was re-runs from season one. They must be burnt out already. Or just real greedy. My wife was bored watching them so no big loss.
1,Not the Entire Season 2,"Not sure why but this is not the entire Season 2 - it's only a handful of eps from the whole season - so, if you want the whole season don't buy this - and let the History Channel know you're pi$$ed.I've tried to find out why it was released in this way through History Channel on Facebook and they proved they didn't even read my question by just directing me to thier website. An e-mail to them through their website went unanswered. My question was simply why it was released like this and if a complete Season 2 would (ever) be available. Guess it's a secret and they don't want my money."
1,Hullabaloo anyone?,"What a disappointment. I was hoping for some new vintage versions of these songs. Nearly all of these great clips are culled from the ""Hullabaloo"" dvds released by MPI a few years ago and are still in print. The picture quality and sound seem to be identical on both. This is more like a sampler disc for the Hullabaloo series if you ask me. Nice low price, though...."
3,worth the price,"This was a pretty fair DVD for the money. A lot of good memories for not a lot of money. Mostly in black and white except for one really nice color performance of the Byrds doing ""Times Are A Changing"". But then most everything was in black and white then anyway. The most annoying thing was on a couple of the songs they had the groups with the obligatory ""Go Go"" dancers leaping all around the stage and blocking your view of the group performing, the Yardbirds ""I am a Man"" in particular. Really sad as it would have been great to see them playing more. They did appear to be really performing on this one, some of the shows just had groups lip sync and pretend to play. But a lot of good performances, these should really be restored to enhance the picture and sound sometime soon. I'm still glad I bought it."
1,Absolutely Rubbish!!,I ordered this DVD by the great title Sixties Rock by Various Artists. First let me tell you it is a complete disaster the quality and sound are horrible. The only song worth the $9.99 is California Dreamin by The Mammas and The Pappas other than that I'll tell you do not waste your money :(
2,Flashbacks Dude,"Man what were people thinking at the time. You have a few pre-punk classics such as The Kinks-You Really Got Me or the Yardbirds-I'm a Man but have to suffer though Paul Revere and the Raiders and Herman's Hermits and other dated material (e.g. California Dreaming-I heard someone in the supermarket once say ""that song has interesting lyrics""). Plus the show Hullabloo apparently insisted on having attractive female dancers to back up all the bands, today I guess you'd call that sexist. The most unintentionally hilarious moment is ""Times are Changing"" by the Byrds, the dancers are on the show are dressed in combat gear. Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs ""Wolly Bully"" is probably the best thing believe it or not. They are not trying to spread some kind of love vibe, they are just having fun. Material like this would later surface on the Nuggets compilations and inspire bands to turn their backs on the sixties and not look back."
2,keys way too stiff,"The keys on this keyboard are horribly stiff.I can't tell you the number of times I've 'dropped' keys, because I am a light/fast touch-typist, and I didn't have enough 'force' behind the keystrokes.The force required, especially on the ENTER key, is very high. It reminds me of olden days, trying to type on a manual typewriter (not that bad, thankfully, but that's the image that always comes to mind!)If you're a heavy-handed typist, or hunting/pecking, you won't care, and I expect you'll love this keyboard..Lori"
3,its size is not as advertised,"This keyboard is functional. The keys are adequately responsive. Unfortunately, I bought it based upon the advertised dimensions:Product Dimensions: 7.2 x 17 x 1 inches ; 1.6 poundsThe advertised dimensions are not accurate. The keyboard is actually 18 inches long -- not 17 inches. This may not be a critical flaw for most, but I have a smaller-than-normal keyboard drawer, and I now have insufficient room for my mouse.This incorrect information is a significant inconvenience in that a $10 keyboard is not worth the return shipping cost, and I must look to another solution."
1,broken key layout,"I don't know for whom this is 'standard', but it's definitely broken in my opinion: The [enter] key is the wrong size, the [backspace] key is also the wrong size, and the [\] key is in the wrong location. Coders and touch-typers - the latter may not notice the moved [\] but will notice the sizings of the two others - be damned, this keyboard will first ruin your accuracy, and then impair your ability to use regular keyboards."
2,Esc key is stuck down on BOTH of 2 keyboards I purchased,"I bought 2 of these keyboards. They have a very cheap look and feel. As well, the Esc on both keyboards was stuck pressed down when they arrived. I managed to get one key to be unstuck (for now) but the other is wasted. The keyboards had random blotches of oil on them. I recommend you buy a better keyboard likeLogitech USB Keyboard. I expect better."
1,Sending back. Defective.,"Returning the keyboard because several of the keys do not work, or work sporadically. Thought it might have been the computer that had the issue, but tried the keyboard on all the computers in our house, and found that it worked the same on all of them. Will be spending a bit more on a better model."
2,You get what you pay for,The keys are kind of bulky. And after the 3rd use one of the stands on the bottom broke. But only using it to chat on my Ps3 so I am not upset apout it really
2,"Not so ""standard"" in my opinion","The backspace key is tiny, made smaller to fit the \ key on top, just so the enter key could be larger than the broad side of a barn. If it wasn't for this major alteration (which doesn't seem standard to me at all), it'd be great for the price, but that change makes it almost useless to me. If you can tolerate that, the keys are pretty nice (and quiet)."
1,took a chance,"Simply, the keyboard I received was defective. Unfortunately, it was 6 months before I decided to use it for writing, so I didn't find out until then that 7 of the alpha-numeric characters failed to respond at all, thus making the entire thing useless. Perhaps some of the other characters don't work either, but I didn't want to waste time to fully assess the thing. I tried it on both windows XP and 7 systems. I gave it 1 star to allow for the possibility that you might get lucky (or not unlucky) and get a good one, in which case the star is for economy."
3,Where's the Portis?,"This DVD has some decent highlights, but only 22 minutes of content. The focus is on the team's overall performance, but concentrates particularly on Plummer and his receivers. Strangely, there is very little mention of Clinton Portis, and almost no highlights of his runs. If you're looking for Portis highlights, like I was, look elsewhere. It does include a couple of great runs by Griffin, Dante Hall's amazing kick return, and Randy Moss's over-the-head touchdown lateral."
5,Doll,I previously bought this doll for my daughter and could no longer find it in a retail store. I was delighted to find it online since it is my daughter's favorite doll.
3,Need DVD and CD,We need a DVD and CD for this selection. So many artist participated in a beautiful song that was for something positive. We need a DVD and CD.
4,Coping through the CLEP,"This is a good basic guide to taking the CLEP tests. However, it lacks the type of practice tests that I expected. Overall it answered many of my questions."
1,Cracking the Clep,"I studied the math portion of this book along with a College Algebra text book from my university, and I still failed. There were many items on the exam that were not addressed in the book. This book only lists short cuts to save time on the exam. I have found that none of the techniques discussed in this book were helpful."
2,Faulty card not worth price,"I used this memory card as the second of two used to take pictures at a high class wedding. All 526 pictures of the 587 capacity of the 512 MB card were retrieved without any problems. When it came time to retrieve the pictures from this 1GB card, only 294 were available out of the 800 or so I thought I had taken. I fould a software program for my computer that claimed to be able to recover lost data on flash memory cards. BadCopy Pro found 806 pictures on that card that normal handling only found 294. All indications is that the card is faulty. The price was cheap and now I think I know why."
3,"Great card for the price, but...sloooooow read.","Excellent value for what you get, however the READ time is very slow compared to other cards I own. Other cards I use with similar specs are lightning fast in comparison. I use these cards in my 10mp digital SLR camera.On the upside, the write time has not been an issue at all even in burst mode shooting sports, and that's what REALLY matters...getting the shot! When the card is removed and plugged into my PC for pulling off shots the card really sweats transferring large files. Keep in mind that my file sizes are large...roughly 100 images per 1 GIG...so the average user may not have the same problem. All in all, a very good deal and a good card...just not super speedy."
1,One year later the Card no longer works,Just a fair warning to all out there considering this card. After purchasing this card it worked great. Then in the middle of my friend's wedding the card no longer was readable by my camera. I could not believe it! When I got home I put the original card in the camera and it worked fine. I reformatted this card and still the camera could not read the card. Not worth the money for only one years use.
4,Very BIG...but fun for All,"We bought some of these wigs for the kids to use in their dress up box. They are 9, 7 & 3 year old boys. They LOVE these wigs. they bobble on their heads -- seems they are made for adults. My husband & I like to joke around in them too. Just bought more so everyone can have one & no more fighting (I hope). Love these!!!"
4,Push Beyond Your Pain,"Push Beyond Your Pain shows the reader that he/she can do all things through Christ who strengthens him/her. This book gives hope to the hopeless, no matter what mistakes have already been made. It shows us when we earnestly repent to God, forgiveness is ours through the precious shed blood of Jesus Christ. It enables you to learn how to Push Beyond Your Pain, while also giving specific Bible text for the reader to prove and test what he/she is reading."
5,Great bag!,"This is one of the best bags I've owned. I needed something a bit more ""grown-up"" than a backpack, but with the capability of one, and washability. The zippered main compartment fits my 15.4"" laptop(in its sleeve), a padfolio/legal pad, several folders, and a couple of books. There's a small zippered pocket in the main compartment and two zippered pockets on the outside- perfect for pens, pencils, etc. There's another, large exterior pocket on the back of the bag, handy for temporary things, like mail or the newspaper. The two pockets on the ends of the bag are absolutely perfect for my Sigg bottle.I love this bag!"
5,Durable and can survive daily commutes to NYC,"I got this bag for my husband because he used to commute to NYC every day. It has survived the subway, PATH train, busses around the city, etc...Great bag and it can take a beating. My husband stuffs it full of his junk for work and it's held up nicely."
5,My son's FAVORITE Video!!!,"This is one of the Best Barney Videos we have ever had and watched!!(We own all of them). My son is 20 mo. old and is fasinated by balls- balls of any kind, basketball, baseball etc... This Video talks about all the seasons and the sports that are associated with each season. WE LOVE IT!!! When he goes to the video shelf and says ""Ball"" I know what Vidoe he wants to watch. You will be very pleased with this video. It's for any age child also (My daycare children love it also). Go For It you Won't be disapointed!!! :)"

5,On The Short List,"There are a few in my collection that are classic: Mixmag Live 20 by Plastikman, Mixmag Live by Laurent Garnier, Mark Farina Seasons, United DJ's Jeno, Jeff Mills Mix-Up...and this one. The beauty of Doc is that he has a specific blueprint of where he wants to go and how to get there. Deep and dark, with it seeming like evil is lurking just below the surface, while breathy vocals soar along the top. If you are reading this review, get this CD. And consider yourself lucky that you can find it used for $3.52; I would pay $20-$30 to hear this."
5,"Wor(l)d is waiting,",We can expect major things to happen when word and thought of Bela Hamvas reach audiences of other languages. His talent for life puts to shame ways of Western civillization and its values. It is time to rethink everything. Bela Hamvas is here to guide us.
1,It's just not funny,"Marmaduke has never made me laugh, or even smile. I think the only people who find this kind of humor funny are either very, very simple-minded or very, very old."
4,The Bookschlepper recommends,"Everyone's favorite Great Dane is captured through the decades in this ""best-of"" volume. Having had two Great Danes, I have always found the Marmaduke cartoons capture the best of these elegant dogs who want to sit on your lap, lie in your bed, eat from your table, and be your best friend. The comic panel has been around half-a-century and is in over twenty countries for a reason: it is wonderful."
2,Why Put A Sticker on My Hat?,"The hat is great , except that it came with a sticker right on the bill of the hat. Even when we removed it the residue is still there, you cannot remove it with a solvent because it would ruin the hat. Poor planning on someone's part."
4,Silver Days,"After the horrors of Nazi Germany, it seems a dream come true! The Platt family is together again, in America! But the dream is quickly overshadowed by the family's extreme poverty. Being a Jewish refugee during World War II is not easy, even in America. With strong german accents and barely enough money for food, every day is a strugle. ***Sequel to Journey to America***"
1,terrible,"This simply one of the worst books I ever seen ,illustrations are really bad compare to the real work of frances hook, they are not even good copies , is a terrible mistake if you buy this book , is not worth it .I'm a sculptor and I admire the work of Frances Hook , but this is not it."
4,Too much author opinion in places,"Although this book gives a warts and all account of Wyatt, it is pro-Earp.Nearly every adjective describing Doc Holliday is negative, although Tefertiller gave no evidence to support his views. Tefertiller's negativaty towards Doc Holliday is plain bitchiness and it lets Tefertiller down."
5,Excellent!!,"Mr Tefertiller's book is by far,one of the most accurate books on Wyatt Earp's life.Without any prejudice, Mr Tefertiller presents facts,reports,paper articles and all sorts of sources of information which makes the book a fascinating journey thru Earp's life.I was surprised by the enormous information Mr Tefertiller brings about Wyatt Earp""s last days in California.This book is a must for ,not only Wyatt Earp's followers but for Old West in general."
4,One Of The Two Best Ever Written On Wyatt Earp!,"I have been researching and reading about the Tombstone, AZ affair between the Earps, Doc Holliday, and the ""Cowboys"" for years. This book is an excellent means by which to understand the man who was Wyatt Earp, why and how he acted as he did, and what brought him to Tombstone. His relationships, quirks, amazing courage and sense of right and wrong are well described within the covers of this book. The author has captured the true image of the man. One of the two best books ever written on MR. EARP! I highly recommend it to all who are curious."
3,Good but overly long,"The life of Wyatt Earp has been told countless times in books and movies. The latest edition to the folklore would have to be special to get any attention from the historians.This book is a strong retelling of the legend and while not entirely hero worship (Earp's flaws are mentioned), one can get the impression that the author is a massive fan of the western hero.The book details the entire life of Earp and goes into great depth (trust me, great depth) into the main part of his history - Tombstone.Everything one could want is here, maybe a bit too much detail at times as I found myself skimming some pages as the font was small and the book was quite big.Overall, I think it is a good read, just needed to have been shortened by 50 to 75 pages."
1,Not Impressed,"I must be from another planet. The positive reaction to this book leaves me confused. It's not an objective look at Earp, as is frequently said, but more hero worshipping. He actually lists the research done for the movie Tombstone as reference material!! I guess it says a lot about the reverence Wyatt fans approach him with that they think of this book as some kind of honest biography. The author sort of cops to what he's up to when he says that when all is said and done, Stuart Lake's bio had most of the facts right. How he came to this conclusion, I have no idea, but I think what he meant was that he and Stuart Lake had the same goal - to glorify Wyatt Earp. So we're still waiting for a good bio of this very interesting frontier character."
4,Wyatt Earp: The Life Behind the Legend,"Well written and informative. Some of the information by Mr. Tefertiller was instrumental in enabling me to view Wyatt from a somewhat different perspective than I previously had. Nevertheless, Wyatt Earp's lifestory is the stuff of legends. Love him or hate him, he was bigger than life and helped settle the frontier. I, for one, think he was great.Lee M. Foley"
4,The real Wyatt,"Excellent historical review of the Earp brothers and the nineteenth century American frontier. Pushed into the corner of defending himself and his family at a time where the courts were unable to convict criminals, Wyatt responded with convictions of his own. He was a man of principle but not always one of morals."
4,Wyatt Earp,the book was of excellent quality being used as stated on amazon. The shipping time was quick and was within the time frame as noted if not before
3,Not a bad product but...,"I purchased it for waxing my porcelain kitchen counters but end result was no better than what I can do by hand. I'd just hoped for more. However it's very light-weight, which is good and can be maneuvered with a single finger! Cordless is the only way to go!"
1,Dont waste your money.,"This product whas purchased with alot of expectation. and it failed miserably, you charge it for hours and the red light never comes off. also it lasts for nothing more that 15 minutes."
4,Waxmaster 99514 7 inch cordless waxer,We've only used it a few times but love the cordless feature and it did a good job of waxing the car.
4,Captive key; difficult to relock for travel when coiled,"No complaints about its function while on the bike; it's a fine medium-duty lock.I don't like the way the key can't be removed while the lock is open. With my previous cable lock, you could take the key out as soon as the lock opened and then lock it without the key. It's a pain to coil it up with my too-large keyring dangling from the end.Getting the tip of the cable aligned with the lock mechanism to coil it as shown in the image takes a fair amount of forceful pushing and twisting to get it just right. Perhaps this will loosen over time. Or maybe I'll figure out what I'm doing wrong.Both of these ""complaints"" probably speak to the solidity of the locking mechanism."
1,poorly made,"Within the first month of owning this lock, parts of the vinyl casing over the flexible metal cord chipped off; not the biggest deal, but now, barely a year after purchase, the key/tumbler combination has deteriorated to such an extent that it takes several minutes to achieve the exact key position which will unlock the cable. Very frustrating. Will probably go back to buy a more expensive kryptonite product next, and will send in the existing lock to OnGuard for a replacement. Then I will own TWO locks when I only need one. :("
4,FOUL PLUS,"Very good lock just little bit heavy and hard, not easy to curve.Everything else is great. 5 keys make it special."
1,Utter rubbish,"This book is about as poor a biography as you'll be able to find. Not only does it offer very little new about Bukowski, but what little it does offer is couched in prose so saccharine it makes you cringe. Don't waste your money, but Howard Sounes' excellent book on Bukowski instead."
5,A very intimate look at a modern legend,"Being a reader of Bukowski for many years, I found this book's strength to be that it cut through the mythologized tales of drinking and offered a very intimate and sensitive look at a modern legend."
5,A must read for any Bukowski enthusiast,"Whether you are a fan of Charles Bukowski or have never even read him, this biography of his life and work exemplifies one of the greatest American poets and prose writers of the twentieth century. Neeli Cherkovski does a brilliant job in presenting Bukowski's work and moreover the man himself. Clearly one of the best biography's I have ever read."
1,"Junk, junk, junk","Intermatic makes nothing but junk. All there products have sub-par performance and are cheap designs. The HA23 suffers from very poor Z-wave range and the drivers are a mess. I would highly avoid all products by this company. There timers, relays, remote controls, and Z-wave devices are poorly designed."
3,Good overview,"This is a good overview of the many rebellions and unprisings in early American history, although it is dated and thus does not include much recent scholarship."
4,Red and green pieces not liked.,I wish the makers of this new rainbow mynah formulation would go back to the original without the colored pieces. The red flowers are too large and my birds don't like green food. The product is good quality otherwise.
2,This book was intended for an art student,"I was some what dissapointed with this book because I found the author too worried about filling text rather than getting to the point. I am a welder and really was looking for a book that discussed reasons, good examples, and how to create wrought iron design. I was not looking for a history lesson. If you are looking for history on the art of Spanish, Italian design etc. and where they were used,this would be the book for you."
1,Let me explain where the 1 star comes from...,"Because it's not possible to give zero. I'm using this on a Samsung SCH-i760, and sound only comes out in mono, despite my best efforts to find a way to get stereo sound. At least it was cheap enough that I did not feel bad tossing it away a few minutes after taking it out of it packaging."
5,Very Good,"This book was a good peice of work in explaining the true SS soldier. The stories of the SS men themselfs. A great peice of WW2 literature without the allied wartime propaganda or the postwar victor's twisted facts and exaggerations. A good journalistic point of view on the facts. With the bulk of the book being handed to the men who were there. Every side of the war committed war crimes, this does does mean every man did. But these stories are just like listening to your grandfather's incredible stories. A great read for those who are intelligent enough to read a book that isnt slanted into the Victor's edited historical fact."
3,Not worth the price,Do not waste your money on this item!!! The bean bag chairs at Wal-mart are a fraction of the cost and made better than this.
3,"""HARD CORE DRILLING""","As a plumbing contractor, we put these cordless drill`s to the test. Because i had heard good thing`s about hitachi i purchased 3 of their cordless 14.4 drill`s(1 hammerdrill, 2 regular drill`s w/ flashlights). I received 2 good months usage on the flashlight`s before wireing problem`s came up. The hammerdrill lasted almost a year and we got 6 months out of the regular drill`s. The connectors that touch the battery leads failed on them all. They became quickly weaker as they were charged. We have found that other brand name drill`s are definitly more reliable."
3,Not for production,"We bought one of these in September and it is worn out in January. The brushes are not replaceable, the battery contacts are bent, and the chuck is loose and wobbly. Unfortunately, we bought 3 more in December. For production, it would be one star. For home use, maybe 3 or 4 stars. It depends on how hard you use it."
3,Good drill for home use. Needs more power.,"Hitachi 14.4v drill kit is a good buy. The light is excellent, but not the reason I purchased the drill.The drill itself has a nice feel in my hands... good balance. It's a good drill for home use, but could use extra power. Battery life is average. I've used the drill with the Kreg Pocket Hole Kit (which is outstanding), and the drill seems to run a little slower then it should when drilling the pocket holes.If I were to need a drill for production, I would be inclined to look for a drill more high-end, like the Panasonic line for example. Having said this, I give it three stars. It's a good (average) tool.I recommend Hitachi drop the light and upgrade the drill."
3,Ergonomic design but needs more power,"It's a well-designed drill that fits well in your hand and feels very balanced. It's weight is just right, and the quality is very high. However, it needs more power when drilling into stud. I'd recommend that you go for the 18v instead. As for the flashlight, it's a piece of junk and the lightbulb burnt out after two months. Instead of buying the exorbitant replacement bulbs, ditch the flashlight and buy a 4-LED model that needs no replacement of bulbs."
1,"VERY. VERY, VERY Basic info!","I am not a pro nor a beginner photographer. I love taking shots at whatever I think will make a nice picture.Nikon should give this away or include it with your camera. This DVD contains very basic information like: how to turn on/off your camera, how to focus, a tiny bit of advance settings, etc...You will get better information on Understanding Digital Photography DVD. I am glad I only paid $5 for it! :-)"
2,Nikon school DVD,The DVD moves too fast for a neophyte using a Digital camera. Probably OK for someone that is more advanced.
3,Basic Operation Instruction,"This DVD is a great tool for the common user who desires an introduction into the functions and operation of their Nikon D60. After watching this DVD, you will be confident in your ability to go out and capture memories.Cons:- Only the basics- Not a guide for anyone wishing to do more than just capture memories."
2,A Bit Disappointing,"I thought this would be a good DVD since it was produced by Nikon. Boy, was I surprised. It is for the true beginner in all ways and features entry level DSLR cameras, the D40 and the D40x. Beautiful photography but very little substance.Nikon School Presents: Fast, Fun & Easy Great Digital Pictures Instructional DVD - for Nikon D40 & D40x Digital SLR Cameras"
2,Too short,"The reviewer with the mountain dew 12 pack must have swallowed the bottles, since this DVD is only one 4 minute track without any menus or anything. Fast cash MTV Style."
5,Love these...after washing several times!,It took about 3 times of washing before I fell I love with these sheets.I've been having issues finding sheets to fit our pillow top mattress and they fit perfect. I'll be ordering another set very soon.
2,Rough,Extremely rough and scratchy. Feel like polyester Do not compare with the Wamsutta sheets purchased in the past but no longer available.
1,Awful!!,I received these sheets because I thought they would be really soft and a good deal.I soaked them and did everything that was suggested but they were so stiff and felt awful.Do not buy. I felt softer sheets at Walmart and wished I bought those instead. I have NO idea where all the good reviews come from.My only guess it that they are fake.
2,You get what you pay for but $150 isn't what you're paying,"No way are these $150 sheets reduced to $59.99. These are $59.99 sheets, without a doubt. And, since Pinzon is Amazon's own line of sheets and you can't buy them anywhere else, I think that the $150 ""list price"" is false advertising. As $59.99 queen-size sheets, they are what you expect. I washed them with detergent and fabric softener before I put them on the bed. They are tough sheets in all senses of the word. They will probably wear well but they feel ""tough."" These are not the sheets you would buy for the Princess who could feel a pea under many layers of mattress. It may be, and I hope, that these sheets will soften up with wear and washing and I'm not going to buy another set right now. But, as the title of this review indicates, I got what I paid for. Next time, I'll pay more for better smoother softer sheets."
3,Scratchier than expected,"These sheets appear to be reasonably well-made, but they are definitely on the scratchy side. I've washed them twice with no improvement, but I am still hoping that they get softer with more washings."
2,Not the best prep for school book out there,"I bought this book to prepare my 3-year-old for preschool. While the pictures are cute and colorful, it is not written for her age (maybe for a one-yr-old). Not much content at all to explain to her what school is all about. I think we read it once or twice, and she hasn't asked to look at it again. Go with ""DW's Guide to Preschool"" instead - you won't be disappointed."
1,Alabama Sweat shirt,Product did not fit. I boutht it for my wife and there was no indication that this product size was only for men.False advertisement and another ripoff!If you buy this product it better be for a guy or you are out of luck!
4,Science and power,Great overview of the most crtical issue confronting the world today undertaken in the context of current socio-political systems and the real power behind them. Highly recommended.
5,NILE RIVER WOMAN Discovered,"A slim volume of diamond tears, this collection shows the power and insight of a voice I wish I'd discovered years ago. ""I Can Die"": ""I can die with you./Everything I love/I can leave/...I can give up on rain/and breezy sensuous seas./I can yield to a burning sun/--my flesh naked as the/wrinkled withering of veils."" This is a fresh voice, whose lyric darkness will echo in your soul. Most powerful favorites: ""I am my own daughter,"" ""Fly away sleeping,"" ""Bint il Nil"" (""I wnt my own religion./I want my own voice./I want my own face./I want my own hair)), ""Nuntandi"" (""I am trapped in the belly of a teardrop""), ""Beatiful ones."" Is she controversial? Of course: all great artists are controversial and controversy is nothing more than the press's attention disorder settling like a bumblebee on a momentary flower."
1,A rough life does not equal good poetry,"Yes, she's had a rough life. Does that make her poetry good, or even bearable? Unfortunately, no it does not. It would indeed appear that reviewers are praising this author for having survived many difficulties rather than taking an objective look at her poetry.When I read poetry I really don't care about the author's personal history. I only care whether the poetry is worth reading. This is not. Reviewers who write excessively about the author's personal travails, her gender or her race, rather than discussing the meat of her writing, are impliedly admitting that the poetry is not worth discussing."
4,Found it!,For years I looked for a poem that I heard Joyce Carol Oates read about Jana's Garden. It's in here. It's wonderful. She is a delight. I was spelling Jana all wrong (Yanna). Who would think there's a book of poetry just for potatoes? It makes me happy each time I open it and read my favorites. Never give up!
5,Review,"""Pulling together a decade of truly magnificent scholarship, this extraordinary book bids fair to be the definitive legal history of perhaps the most important legal issue of the twentieth century. This is legal history at its best, and on a panoramic canvas."""
2,Angst gets in the way,"When I first read the synopsis of this story I thought it was going to be about a woman, who with the reluctant permission of her family and fiance, goes back to her grandmother's house to grieve for her lost sister and rediscover her past and the things about herself that give her life meaning again. And since the father was in no position to care for his child she just takes him with her. Instead she runs away and hides and worse, causes so much more grief, that she becomes a rather selfish and unsympathetic character. Poetic language is one thing but not when pointless plot devices get in the way. This story could have been told with grace without the angst ridden hiding out aspect. I understand the point that grief can bring you to desperate measures but this wasn't plausible or believable and reduces what could have been a compelling story"
5,A New Romance Reader!,"Sin, by first time novelist Crystal Rhodes, has made a romance reader of me. This powerful love-story, filled with descriptive passages, put me at the heart of the love affair between Nedra and Sin. I became so caught up that for a moment I became Nedra! I felt her dismay when she was criticized about the affair with the love of her life. I could really relate to all the turmoil and confusion that the had to contend with in her congregation. But I was satisfied with the ending. I applaud Ms. Rhodes and am eagerly awaiting her next release."
5,Prose translation of lyrical poetry does not travel,"This edition of Heine 's poems has an excellent introduction and a very clear and understandable prose translation by Peter Branscombe. His lyrical brillance made him the most beloved German poet after Goethe. This work provides a clear introduction to what Heine's poetry is about , contains a wide selection from different periods and kinds of verse. However it is impossible for the English- only reader to really have the full feeling of the poems, or in fact to sense their greatness. Poetry is by and large in the language it is written in. Some can be translated as Shakespeare is in Russian and German , but some do not travel.A small sample "" Spring is serious, its dreams are sad, every flower seems moved by pain, secret melancholy quivers in the nightingale's song.Oh do not smile, beloved beauty, in that friendly, cheerful manner, do not smile! Oh, I'd rather you cried, I so love kissing tears from your face."
3,plenty of fizz but wheres the soda,"the intrepid Josie Dew is back on her bike again.this time its coast to coast via a straight line right through the heart of the good old u.s.ofa.I cant wait until she comes to Australia so she can tell the world how sunny the continent is,how friendly the people are and how much like the rest of Europe we turned out to be."
4,Entertaining view of life on a bike in the USA,"Like all Josie's books, it's funny, well written and entertaining. Keeps you turning the pages. If you're considering biking in the USA - read this first!"
1,Stay Clear of This One,"I read the glowing reviews before buying this lamp and thought -Wow, such a pretty lamp at such a great price - Well, now I know that you get what you pay for. The lamp arrived promptly, but many of the bead strands were broken and the beads were scattered loose in the packaging. I spent the better part of an hour restringing and glueing beads before I noticed that about 1/4 of the embroidery was unraveled from the fabric shade. I'm returning this disappointment for a full refund. No replacement please!"
2,Bad customer service,"When I received the earrings, I loved them. Wore them once and kept falling off. Wrote to customer service about the problem - that one earring would not shut properly and never received a reply. I would not order from this company again due to their customer service."
3,Perfect Waltz Not So Perfect,"""The Perfect Waltz"" as a title is a misnomer. The title leads one to believe this will be a light, breezy, romantic tale. It's not. While some waltzing does occur, this book is really quite heavy and serious with storylines involving child kidnapping, rape and prostitution. Not topics I want to read about in an historical romance. Hardly the escape from reality I was looking for."
4,continuing story of the Merridew girls,"This book takes the story of another of the Merridew sisters, Hope. Now that her two older sisters have made good matches and she and her twin and younger sister are being taken care of by her great uncle, Hope's days consist of riding in the park and deciding what ball to go to, or other entertainment. I felt that she was written really well - she was strong, independent, but very caring and warm.Sebastian Reyne is just trying to find a wife that can take care of him and his traumatized younger sisters. He's got the perfect candidate picked out, but when he sees Hope for the first time he has a hard time sticking to his plan.Hope had so much to offer Sebastian and his sisters and the story played out very well. As with the previous book (The Perfect Rake) there was humor as an added bonus.I'm anxious to get started on The Perfect Stranger to find out what happens with Hope's twin, Faith."
2,.,"I was only interested in the kids and what their stories were, but after so long they couldn't save the book for me."
1,disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this sports cap. If the cap is screwed tightly into your Klean Kanteen, you can't get a good swig of liquid and the bottle whistles when you drink from it. If you loosen the sports cap (untwist it just a bit), you can drink more easily from the bottle, but it leaks all over you! I have 2 Klean Kanteen bottles with sports caps on them and both perform in the same way."
3,North Georgia's only Mountain Biking Guide,"Jim Parham's guide to North Georgia mountain biking does a good job of including most of the trails a rider may encounter in the northern third of the state. Each trail is laid out on a two page spread, making it easy to copy the page and map on an 8.5x11 sheet to take along with you. All essential information is there, including distances, difficulty ratings, and elevation profiles. The things I didn't like about this book are: the layout - the book is divided into 'Easiest' 'More Difficult' and 'Most Difficult.' Different trails in one area may fall under each category making it difficult to locate and read on all the trails in a given area. Also, the descriptions are very short, no more than a brief paragraph."
3,Cool to listen to but no groove,"I had higher expectations of the album considering it was in the United DJs of America series, but it is not something I could dance to. This CD is worth buying because it has a great beat to listen to, but is not something that you can groove to."
4,Touching and emotional...,"Brad conveys emotion like Monet could paint flowers...with a natural ease and a unique style that cannot be denied. The uplifting songs on this album will make you feel elated, while the softer ballad-type songs will have you weeping like a child. When I first bought this, I could only listen to it in small doses. Too much would wear me out emotionally, and I would be put off from listening to it again for a long time. I only play it once every 2 years or so, but I still consider it one of my favorites. I remember back in '94, driving my car in the rain, singing along, and all of a sudden, I'm sobbing like my dog died. A few songs later, I'm bobbing my head along to the music like I don't have a care in the world. It's that magical. Most musicians can only dream of crafting songs this real."
4,Temple of The Dog-Revisited,"If you were a Temple of The Dog fan, knew who Mother Love Bone was and who Pearl Jam is...you will at very least thoroughly enjoy this disc. It's been out for quite a while and I've already literally worn one copy out (no kidding). ""Buttercup""'s sensuality is undeniable and ""Down"" with it's almost eerie feel fills a room with emotion."
1,"Terrible, terrible!","I bought this for my 3 month old and took it back the next day. He kept knocking off the dangling crab and fish. This is not a very sturdy product at all! He did enjoy the lights/music, but it was not worth keeping. Overall not a good toy."
1,Beware Of This Toy,"I bought this for my daughter to try to encourage her to sit up and play, and as soon as I put it together and saw her play with it I decided to return it. The space at the top of the dangling crab could mash little fingers very badly."
1,Many Problems With This Toy,I had many problems with this when I bought it for my daughter. The dangling crab and fish came off constantly and had sharp edges. It was really hard to change the positions too. This toy doesn't even have that much to hold a child's attention. I don't feel it is worth the money or even very safe. The lack of safety comes from the sharpness of the pieces and from the toy being wobbly.
1,Do NOT buy this toy! Unsafe,This toy is absolutely terrible. It's extremely wobbly. I was afraid it would topple and fall on top of my new born. It was also impossible to change the position on the main console (even with help from my husband). We ended up returning this toy. It's not worth the money and I'm honestly surprised that they still sell it. Some of the plastic pieces have sharp edges.
1,"They are shipping it by the each, with NO BRACKET, and NO BULB!","Amazon is shipping it by the each, with NO BRACKET, and NO BULB! No wiring either! What a rip off! Totally different than pictured."
5,If Only Shirley Were My Mom!,A friend gave me this book and I read it in one sitting. It made me feel like I had the family I have always dreamed of having. If only Shirley were real! Kudos to the author and to the publisher for giving us something so simple and yet so powerful. When will the next book be out? I could use a trip back home!
3,"Decent game, good price, only lasts for a couple days.","My 10 year old son loved it- for all of the 2 days it took him to solve it completely. And yes, he did eat and sleep and go to school on those days.So, for the price, it's probably worth it (and they liked the little cartoon that was included with the game). But don't get this expecting to have years of enjoyment out of it..."
3,"Younger fans of PPG, watch out","My daughter will turn 5 this summer and was so excited to get this book. But when we got it, we realized that the games and puzzles in it are way too difficult for her. It is full of scrambled words and crossword puzzles. That may be fun for older girls, but for someone just learning how to read, it is just frustrating"
5,Patio Furniture Cover,"After reviewing many options for furniture covers, I chose the Veranda covers. I couldn't be happier with the choice. Veranda covers are top quality - heavy duty but nicely finished so they don't look overly 'industrial'. Already our covers have weathered a dozen rain storms and two snow storms and they still look new. I can't imagine there being any furniture cover available that is better than the Veranda covers. I recommend these to everyone who asks."
5,LOOK NO FURTHER...THIS IS IT!,"The quality, the fit and the price...incredible...I am very impressed...Looked all over the internet...this is it!"
5,5 star,"Just received the veranda patio chair covers. Great fabric and quality! Nice looking and they fit our new extra high back, wide seat, swivel rocker, outdoor furniture with some room to spare."
4,Great Furniture Cover,"These are excellent covers, they fit well, are heavy duty and have straps that hold them to the furniture when its windy. I would have have given them five stars if measurement information was better. I originally bought chair covers that didn't fit and had to return them."
5,Perfect for stacked chairs,"I have 4 stacked chairs. I simply measured my chair height and depth and width in their stacked position. This cover fit perfectly and now for the winter, windy, rainy season it is still protecting my patio furniture. Great quality material too"
5,Attractive and well constructed,"These chair covers are extremely attractive and well constructed.They are on glider chairs on our very visible back deck, and so wanted something that looked good. The subdued two tone offers a sense of style, while providing good protection. The handles and cording along the bottom provide for an excellent fit. Would purchase again."
1,Only lasts one season then starts to leak,They look nice and fit great but I was dissapointed the second summer I put them out they started to leak and almost ruined all my cushions.
3,"one was great, one had ripped seams on arrival","I do like this cover- I order two, for matching chairs. However, one that I received was ripped at the seam between the two fabrics. It looked like it had been returned - the package was torn. I was able to get it fixed, and have a matching pair. I couldn't return for a replacement, Amazon didn't have any more in stock at that time. Quality checking could have been better."
5,Perfect!,Just received this today. Excellent quality and fit my chairs perfectly. It is just what I needed to protect my furniture from the Arizona sun and occasional wind and rain storm.
1,Lost stone,I would not recommend this ring. The very first time I wore it out one of the stones fell out. Very disappointing.
5,Droll Yankees nectar guard,Wow. Just wow. Wish I'd known about these years ago! They actually work. It took the birds a little while to figure it out but what a great product.
5,Love it,Great quality bag! I would recommend these bags to anyone. Great design on it too! Thanks so much! Would love to have some more selection!
5,RFrancis(Trini),"Really nice everyday casual watch,it goes cool with jeans the rhinestones makes it look girly n'cute."
5,Moon Hunting Re-Defined,"You will forever view your hunting by the moon phases in a different light after reading this book. You will also examine and very likely modify your hunting to improve and increase your harvest successes. Charlie Alsheimer backs up his philosophies and strategies with experience and research. It is not just based on random opinions and limited field experience. This is a ""must read"" for the serious deer hunter!"
5,2 Thumbs Way UP!!,"The idea to remake this awesome 80's movie into a Musical is sheer genius! I want to be the first person in line when the show comes out! The music in the album is amazing. It's like I'm back in the 80's, only without all the reverb. What more could you ask for? I love it!"
4,TRADITIONAL,You gotta give it to Troy Ramey. He's been round for a long time. He and the Soul Searchers bring that good ole traditional quartet sound every time. You can put this on and have a nice cozy time. He Brought Me Out!
4,Their best ep overall,"Firstly the tracks on this cd are1. destroy the robots2. pickles3. it is as it was4. I'll sell you suicide5. futureless6. destroy the humansThe first 2 songs on this ep are argueably the best put out by this band, a great balance between musicality and making accessible music. The next 3 songs are fairly solid too and delve a bit more into their unusual side combining acoustic with heavier riffs. The final song is a throwaway of silence and noises.Overall great ep and its a shame no albums have been released yet comprising the best of all the eps and singles."
1,Not what I expected,"This book is not what I expected. I was hoping for some choral warm-ups, active ice-breaker games, etc.--anything for active music learning with active children! Instead, it's a very boring collection of fill in the blanks, crossword puzzles based on traditional hymns, etc. Nothing I could use for my after-school choir at a Christian school. Although, a few of these activities might be good to leave for a substitute that has no musical background. Save your money."
3,Nothing Earthshatteringly Original Here...,"I recently started directing the Children's Choir at my Church. Never having done this before, I thought it might be a good idea to do some research and have some ""tricks"" up my sleeve before the first day. So, I got this book.I was disappointed. Anyone with a background in choir singing or with a little bit of originality has probably thought of most of these ideas already. I know there was nothing in this book that hit me with ""What a great idea!"" and a lot of the activities aren't practical... unless you have a TON of time to kill. Or, kids that are extremely well-behaved and move from one task to the next without losing focus and needing to be redirected a lot. I have found my choir kids are not like that. :)So, I can't recommend it whole-heartedly. Maybe half-heartedly."
2,Had no clue,That this was a man made material boot or I would of passed ! Very comfortabke for work though but that is about it
3,better to buy bigger size,"It is not too tall only with 2 inches heel. I like it. The leather is good and comfortable. However, I recommend you to buy a bigger size. I usually put on 8, I ordered 8.5, it is still a little bit smaller."
5,Fun classy boot,"This is a fun boot. It's very stylish, and I love pointy toe boots. The leather is very soft kid leather. Great price and I have gotten compliments on them."
5,WONDERFUL ON WALT,"A most moving video! And you feel you know all aspects of Whitman.I use this for lit. classes to show the many sides of W.W.I'll also suggest Rumi's poetry - for the heart.It ties in well with Paul Twitchell's fully spiritualwritings.Baraka Bashad,TPB"
1,You get what you pay for at Target,"Okay folks, this is my fourth and LAST floor lamp I buy from Target. Where do I start? The wire that runs through the lamp always get stressed during assembly and my last two broke. One came not working at all. After a couple of months all Target floor lamps break, whether it is the pole that holds up the lamp, or the on off switch. This particular beauty came broken right out of the box. One of the threads were stripped on the legs so the lamp kept falling over, after a modification with electrical tape, i got it working. Unfortunatley they package this stuff so crazy it is more hassle than it is worth to disassemble and return to Target. Please do yourself a favor, spend the extra money and go to a real lighting store."
3,You get what you pay for...,"This is a great cheap lamp. Of course it is cheap so don't expect quality. It was easy to put together, I personally didn't need the directions for most of it, and it is very attractive. After about a year and a half I started experiencing the trouble with the light switch that many of the other reviewers mentioned. I used some pliers to turn it off and on for a few weeks as the cord is plugged in behind a heavy bookcase. Not very convenient. So I finally got it unplugged and took the top apart and replaced the socket the bulb inserts into. (like this one Turn Knob Lamp Socket) Annoying, but a simple fix. It will probably be fine now that is has a better quality piece there. Sad, but most likely true."
2,if you're looking for a short term lamp,"I bought this lamp over two years ago, and while it looked great and served its purpose, it just stopped working. I did experience the threading on the light switch causing difficulties turning it on, like one reviewer reported.I could get it to work after that still, but now it won't work at all. It's cheap enough to buy another I suppose, but I absolutely LOVE this lamp and don't want to buy it every 2-3yrs.If I knew then what I know now, I would have spent the money on a more quality lamp that looked just as nice but lasted a little longer."
4,Cute floor lamp,"Not too hard to put together. I like the 3 way lighting option, it is bright enough for a small room or space. Consider the even plane of where you place it though. It can be difficult to keep this lamp level."
3,Should have listened to reviews,"I loved the idea of this lamp and it seemed perfect for the living room (cheap too) but some reviews said that the switch broke shortly after using it and sure enough it happened to me as well. However, I don't think it is entirely the lamps fault. Obviously there is some assembly to this product and I think thats where the problem comes in. I spent a hour with the lamp, a six pack, and a few different outlets to come to find out that the plastic screw piece that holds the glass shade in place had to be crimping something that stopped the switch from working. I think it has something to do with the wiring that runs down one of the legs inside and it's positioning (which you don't have much control over during assembly) that causes this to happen. I removed the plastic screw piece and the lamp works fine, holds several beers at a time, and now that it works the wife likes it too. I hope she doesn't try to move it because the glass shade will fall off, lol."
4,LOVE IT!!,Very easy to assemble and it looks nice! What I love about it (and the reason we registerd for it) is that it isnt as top heavy as most other floor lamps. Its much safer since it is less likely to get knocked over. We love it and have gotten many compliments on it!
4,Nice lamp!,This lamp is a nice addition to my living room. I like the shelves because you are able to put some decorative items on them. I am happy with this purchase.
3,It grows on you,"At first I was disapointed in this album. Compared to what I've heard Josh Wink mix in the past, this album seems pretty tame. But if you are patient with him, he does delivers by the end. I like this album more and more as I listen to it. The last four songs redeem a kind-of-slow start."
1,Nothing Beautiful About The Theology,"This book does very little but prattle about vague notions of the Eucharist. It is full of the Modernist notion of Christ present in ""the assembly"", the Bible, and the Eucharist in which the Real Presence is downplayed. I recommend reading ""Work of Human Hands"" by Fr. Anthony Cekada"
3,Mixed bag,"I was excited about this cd and when it arrived I listened to it right away. What a disappointment. While du Pre was wonderful as always, de Peyer was not up to what I would have expected. His sound was ok overall and musically the performance was pretty good, but he had a tendency to spread whenever the dynamics approached the forte level in both the sonatas and the trio. I would recommend the performance as a good representation of what these pieces should be, but would caution that one should not emmulate de Peyer's sound on this disk. Having heard him live more recently than this recording, he might just agree..."
1,Only if you enjoy lukewarm coffee,"The whole idea of the thermal carafe with the programmable start time is insane...if you want hot coffee you have to get up anyway to heat the carafe before brewing! What's the point of this stupid thing? It was a horrific waste of my money, a terrible idea for a product and I can't wait to replace it."
2,Junk,"Originally had a Cuisinart thermal, 12 cup. This coffee maker was $100 and I went through three of them in two years. The thermos was great but the coffee pot is designed terrible. I figured ""how could I go wrong with a Mr. Coffee?"" They were the first and should be reliable. I bought their Thermal Pot for about $60 and it lasted two months. One pot of coffee took almost thirty minutes to complete. The steam that came out of the top was unreal! The clock stopped working due to the excessive moisture and I took it back and got another one from Walmart. The second one worked great for two weeks and then started with the excessive steam problem again, although not as bad as the first pot. The beeper is almost too quiet. Some reviewers have said it is too loud. Not mine! I am really disappoint that Mr. Coffee would sell a product that is this inconsistent in performace. Their marketing director must have been a castaway from Microsoft. Apparently it is a good pot if you get one that works properly."
3,Better then most,Makes great coffee very strong and great taste. The craft works well and keeps the coffee warm but if you don't heat it up as recomended with warm water then it does not stay has hot. Also if you do not put the craft in perfectly then it spills all over.For the price you can't beat this coffee maker but if price is no option then pick another one.Enjoy your coffee!
2,Faulty Clock Mechanism,"BE ADVISED THAT THE CLOCK IS PRONE TO MECHANICAL FAILURE!!! I have returned the non-thermal version of this coffee pot THREE times. The first time was just a broken carafe, but the 2nd and 3rd times were mechanical failures. After the 1st return, I repurchased the same pot. Within one month, the entire clock faded to black and would not work, which meant NO timer functioning. I thought that this was a fluke, so I returned the pot (again!) and got another one. After 3 months, the clock still worked, but the option to set the clock or turn on the timer just STOPPED working. Out of the blue! So, it too was returned. I don't think I'll be buying any Mr. Coffee products again. BE ADVISED THAT THE CLOCK IS PRONE TO MECHANICAL FAILURE!!!"
2,Disappointed with this item,"We find this coffee maker very disappointing. It does not get the coffee nearly hot enough. We have to presoak the cafe' in hot water to get something close to a decent cup of coffee. And the idea that the coffee is kept hot is totally absurd. Then on top of this luke warm coffee, this coffee maker leaks water all over the counter. If you expect a hotcup of coffee ready for you in the morning or at anytime, this is not the coffee maker for you. Don't waste your time and money on this. If you want a show piece to set on on your counter and look good, but don't care about the coffee, then this maybe what you want. It does look nice, I'll give it that."
3,Not overwhelmed,"This coffee maker has not met my expectations. It is difficult to measure the amount of water added because of the stainless steel carafe, and the end result is not consistent even though it has a setting for ""strong"" -- the coffee is hardly ever ""strong."" Very insconsistent, although I do like the fact that the carafe keeps the coffee warm for a long time without scalding. Also do not like the fact that it uses a basket style filter as opposed to cone. But the worst thing about this coffee maker is the coffee comes out in barely a trickle, even when you hold the button down as hard as you can. If I hadn't paid so much for it, I would throw it in the garbage and order a different model."
2,MR. COFFEE COFFEEMAKER PROBLEM,"I purchased this coffeemaker to replace my older leaking Braun coffeemaker with a stainless steel product and felt confident this Mr. Coffee coffeemaker would deliver the performance I wanted. Unfortunately, the very first time I used Mr. Coffee FTTX85 it totally flooded out my new granite countertop and left me running for sponges, paper towels, and mops! I was thankful this was only a water ""test run"" and it was not my usually strong coffee going every which way ... but trying to control hot water gushing out was not a picnic either. After cleaning up the mess, I reread all the instructions and tried to reset controls, etc. Eventually, I decided this was not the coffeemaker for me; plus it has too too much plastic (which I dont like the taste of in my coffee) so I will try another brand. When I originally checked the reviews on this product, they were higher than they currently are ... what happened here???"
2,Horrible carafe,"The coffee maker itself is great and I am happy with its features. The pot is idiotic. As indicated by previous reviewers, you do have to push very hard with your thumb, so it's easier to remove the lid, either way there are spills and you do have to nearly turn it upside down due to bad design. I also agree with previous reviews with regard to the lack of heat - I'm constantly reheating a freshly poured cup. In summary, I hate this pot immensely.Mr. Coffee FTTX85 10-Cup Thermal Programmable Coffeemaker"
4,Last gasp from Belgian industrial...,"It's been a full 10 years since Front 242 dished out 06:21:03:11 UP EVIL and 05:20:09:12 OFF, believe it or not. In case you forgot or never learned, Front 242 was a Wax Trax favorite among industrial music in the late eighties/early nineties, among such acts as Nine Inch Nails, Frontline Assembly, Skinny Puppy, et al. 06:21:03:11 UP EVIL should definitely be part of your collection; it is perhaps their hardest and coldest release (save Official Version). Much more lush than earlier releases.In case you were wondering what the cryptic numbers are in the title, it's not hard...each number corresponds to a letter in the alphabet. 01=A, 02=B, etc. You figure it out."
4,Certainly worth taking a look at,I think this is one of their classics. I've been listening to this album on and off for years.
2,get a second monitor instead,"It cost me almost $30 to get this product. Then the 3M strips pulled off of my monitor. I ended up picking up a second monitor second hand from work and that was infinitely more productive anyway. Basically, 3M strips just won't hold this thing up like you want it to."
3,"crappy threads, otherwise OK",Overall this thing is great... works exactly like I expected it to. The one downside to this grip is the bolt screw that holds in onto the rail. The thing is pretty flimsy and stripped the threads the second time I put it on. You can easily replace it with a longer bolt and nut but it was just way to easy to strip the threads.
2,It missed the point,"Reading this book is like watching Iron Eagle or Top Gun, I think we are a little over the 80s, this book is intended for people that definitively likes that hollywood accuracy to depict stories.I guess this wasn't what I was looking, maybe it's a good book for someone who doesn't know much about the military. For my part I was looking to track the path of the F-16 Pilot training and many other details. I'm a very avid fan of the viper and I have been fortunate to see vipers from 4 different countries.All have to say that I am still looking for such book. I'm really not very interested in knowing too much about partying and rituals. And being myself in the military I know that it's a very small part of the whole picture."
1,"Misleading and disappointing, avoid this import","The Bach piece, Concerto N2 Pour 2 Claviers BWV1061, is not performed on two pianos as was memorably dramatized by Isabelle Huppert in the film. The track is lifted from some other source, as are the Winterreise songs. The CD cover displays the legend ""Musiques du Film"" with an asterisk after it, leading to legal copy not legible on Amazon. This must disclaim that the music is ""inspired"" from the film as opposed to from the film, making this import not a soundtrack but a rip-off. Caveat emptor, la pianiste."
2,Misleading Miami Memorabilia,"I bought this hoping it would be similar to the 'America's Game' series that the NFL runs for the super bowl champions. The DVD is barely 45 minutes long, and barely skims the surface of 2001 season. There's not nearly as much game footage as I was hoping for, nor is there any backstory about the team, rivalries or players. It doesn't even note the abundance of talent on the team that realistically the 2001 canes the best college football team of all time. Really disappointing stuff."
1,The book has no substantal information on the topic,"This book did not prove to be beneficila in helping me undestand my diseases. It made me feel helpless and esasperates. I do not recomend anybody to read this book. If anything it has allowed me to fall deeper into my eating disorder. The book did not present any clear fews on this issues. Every was in a shade of gray, when you deal with this issue you need to stick with black and white."
4,"Practical for parents, binge/purgers and counselors",Gives a well presented behavioral approach (with definite feminist leanings) to treating binge/ purgers. The authors are not critical of parents or spouses. They encourage the binge/ purger to take responsibility. They have only a few suggestions for those who are not ready to do so. Nothing about men with this eating disorder is mentioned. Overall this book is extremely practical and helpful.
4,I like them.,"I am buying the pack of 40 again. If you eat a lot of junk like cookies, candies and cakes these won't taste good to you, but to me they are very tasty."
1,Yyyeeeccchhhhh!!!,"One star is too high a rating for this failure. Reading the description led me to hope for a nutritious snack that could be enjoyed by my whole family without their being aware of health value. Instead, there was an odd taste, almost like rum, that just ruined any chance of liking these things. I had trouble even giving them away, but finally succeeded. Needless to say, this item is off my shopping list permanently."
1,"A little ball, a lot of nastiness","I was given one of these chocolate walnut balls by a coworker. The few short minutes of gratefulness and anticipation came to an abrupt halt immediately after taking the first bite. The first taste is somewhat like dry sawdust, followed by a quickly intensifying taste of strong liquor. The bad taste seemed to fill my nasal passages and was so overwhelming that I had a gag reaction and could not finish the bite. The rest of the ball went straight to the trash, and I was left with (amazingly, after all the pain I'd already been through) a foul sour taste in my mouth. This is the worst-tasting snack I've ever tasted in my life."
1,Unmatched bad taste,"The severity of how bad this product tastes is difficult to describe using the words that currently exist in the English language (and probably any other language, for that matter). Putting it lightly, these balls are just dry, bitter, and all around horrible tasting. Like the other reviewer, I also noticed an alcohol taste, but I just assumed that somehow my Chocolate Walnut balls had gone bad and fermented in the package. However, after seeing the other review, I guess that's just how they make them. Yuck.Stay away from this at all costs, including free."
3,Good visual resource,"Illustrated with photos of reenactors wearing period uniforms, this book about soldier life during the Civil War is a good introduction for those interested in the War Between the States. The photography is good (some has been photoshopped to look like tinted photos) but the text is very basic and I did find one error in fact (Union regiments were allowed to lapse after enlistment and new regiments formed but Confederate regiments were kept supplied with replacements). Still, a good book."
1,pa kua,"If you are interested in the internal arts this is not a good DVD to learn from. The guy does not speak English, the subtitles are a poor translation at best and his movement is lazy and inconsistent; completely lacking followthrough which makes him even harder to follow. I recommend looking at Dr. Jerry Alan Johnson instead. You can check him out on Youtube..."
2,Sleeve lengths don't differ when you go up in size,"I'm a 36/37 in sleeves, but normally wear a large size t-shirt. I ordered a large and the sleeves were about 3 inches too short, so I ordered an X-large and again the sleeves were too short, for some idiotic reason I thought I'd try an XX-large and a XXX-large to see if their sleeves would be long enough. Unfortunately neither of them had long enough sleeves. So If you're like me and have longer arms be aware that the sleeves may not be quite lengthy enough for you.THEY DO SHRINK IN THE WASH! So be advised if you plan on wearing it for a specific reason to wash it and try it on before you actually need to wear it.I do like the color selection"
5,great for the money,"bought 38 of these in 09, still wearing them. these are excellentnote: dont wash in hot water or they will shrink bad. wash in warm"
3,Mixed feeling,"I have mixed feelings regarding this book. Personally, I haven't heard of the author prior to picking up a copy of this book. I understand he has quite an audience. I'm sure this audience will find the book a good purchase. However, for those unaware of Mr. Christensen, it will take some time to get used to his writing style and approach to martial arts.'Solo training' delivers. It's packed with drills and excercises. It motivates you to go out and train alone. It's clear and concise. Reading it, even without actually performing the excercises, gives you insight about fighting.The author's karate background is dominant. Both in tournaments and actual street fights. Those who wish to train alone who come from different background (other than karate) will find this a bit awkward. Maybe Mr. Christensen shuold've titled his book ""The Karatist Guide to Training Alone""."
2,All it tells you to do is kick and punch,"This book is nothing special. Anyone who knew anything about fighting would already know everything in this book. I bought it expecting to see some unique routines or exercises that would make someone a better martial artist. It tells you to do so many types of kicks and punches everyday, along with over an hour of bag work. I don't believe boxer do that much bag work, and I would feel wrong sayig Bruce Lee did that much. If you want my advise buy the book about Bruce Lee called ""The Art of Expressing the Human Body"""
2,Not many picture -> Hard to follow,I bought this book based on the 5 star review but I am really disappointed. Instructions are not clear and in many cases there are no picture showing what the author tried to say. If there are pictures supported text then they are not enough to show the movements. The book is useless for me.
1,Blah!,"This book was everything you already knew, put into writing. I diagree with a few of the techniques, but that is because I prectice muay thai not tae kwon do. I also thought there was lots of stuff that was left out of the book. There are lots of things you can do at your house to train for martial arts that were not included in this book. I recoment you go get the Bas Rutten martial arts work out. You'll love it if you are serious."
2,Not very useful for me,"I agree, solo practice is very important. If you have no clue what you could practice alone, are training karate / tkd / krav maga, and fairly novice, there might be some good drills for you.If you train something ""softer"", or martial arts that emphasize body unity (Chinese MA, Judo, Aikido, systema etc), this is probably not your book.A problem whith this book is that it has plenty of drills, but the detailed instructions on the techniques are lacking. This is OK if you assume the reader has trained longer, or atleast gets the details from their own teacher. But if you've trained longer, i doubt you'll get much new info from this book. And if you've trained less, IMO you need more detailed info. If you need to ask the details from your teacher, you'd be better off asking the drills from your teacher too.Atleast one good option is ""Attack proof"" by Perkins / Ridenhour / Kovalsky. It's more a self-defence book, but had drills i found actually useful and new to me."
5,Solo Training and More,"Solo training is that side of martial arts training that moves the practitioner from a novice to a craftsman then to becoming an expert. In this world of fast food and fast food martial arts, many students do most of their practicing in the dojo and unfortunately, they are still being promoted. This book instills the importance of solo training and provides suggestions so one can increase their skills and yet keep it all interesting.Some of the information is standard primer material, but much of solo training is working on the basics and perfecting those rudimentary techniques. Now to say primer is not to say that this is a picture book on technique, but basic information. Chapter 6, ""Odds & Ends Workout"" is probably the most interesting chapter that goes beyond that normal martial arts primer. All in all, Christensen's book excels and once again he has produced an excellent text."
2,Too much Tkon!,Too much story about the Tkon and Q and not enough about the Enterprise and her crew. It seemed that this whole book could have been paraphrased in one chapter at the end of the last book or the beginning of the next. Disappointing at best.
1,"Really, Really, Really, Really BAAAD!!!!!!","Untill last week I had never bought a bad Trek book. Some were really great, some were merely ok, but none were bad. Now I see why. All the ""bad"" from the entire series has been condensed and put between two covers, leaving all the other books much better off. Unfortunately, the two covers enclose the Q-ZONE. What could have been going through Greg Cox's mind when he wrote this drivel? Absolutely nothing happens for the entire first half of the book, followed by a second half when absolutely nothing happens. To say that the book is boring is equivalent to saying that the Empire State Building is just a building. Spend your money wisely and buy a different Trek book--ANY other Trek book. Please."
2,Disappointed,"Well, being a long-time Trekkie (TNG is my favorite), I was quite disappointed with this book. Liked the premise, liked the characters, did not like the execution. This book, the 2cd of a 3 book trilogy had way too much talk and background info for my liking. It appears the author took 1 exciting book and split it into 3 much weaker parts. Profits are the only reason I can think of why this was done."
4,"Good continuation, but drags on the Tkon history","In this second book of this trilogy, we see a great deal of the Tkon Empire history, which ruins were found by the Enterprise in the first season episode, ""The Last Outpost."" In my opinion it drags on way too long and could have been shorten combined in parts with the other two books of this trilogy. We see what caused the fall from power of this great empire."
2,"A slow, gooey midsection","Unlike the first book in the trilogy, the second book drags on. The author, contrary to what every sci-fi fan knows, continually confuses the concepts of ""universe"" and ""galaxy"". Attempting to torture Classic Trek and Next Gen villians (like Gorgon) into the Q biography is sometimes too contrived to bear. And the Betazed scientist -- please! Shove him out the nearest airlock already!"
2,Part 2 of 3 drags on!,"The first book was good and had much more action and humor than this second installment did. Here the story, while still partly in the present, actually takes us to the past to an event that changes Q's life forever. Though the premis is good, it is drawn out ever so long, and I found myself wanting to skip ahead to where the action is.There are a few interesting events, but Q is not as well written as he was in the last book.Other major characters take a back seat to the overall plot in this chapter.The one thing that really bothered me is that Jean Luc, for reasons unkown, cannot figure out why Q is allowing him to witness events in the past. It is sooooo obvious to the reader, but Jean Luc only figures it out on the last page.I honestly think the author could have condensed book two into books 1 and 3 respectfully. Make each one of the slightly longer and cut out some of the inaction and drawn out sequences."
3,Breathing Room,"After the frentic pace of the first novel of the series, this one slows down a bit and allows the characters to breath and really explore the situation--not only of the Enterprise being in danger, but also of Q's past. It's an interesting journey and one that I really hope pays off in the final installment of this trilogy. However, the book does lag a bit towards the middle and end with Q's friends actions being described far too long and little or no reaction from Picard. I only hope part three can put all the pieces that are floating around together into a rocking, rollicking conclusion."
2,All potential left unused,"The second book in the Q-Continuum trilogy is even worse than the first one.We get a novel with as much potential as any novel can have, and it's left completely unused.""Q-Zone"" centeres around Q's past, showing us Q's and Picard's journey through space and time. Unfortunately we don't get to witness the ultimate, surreal, fantastic Q-adventure, like the later released ""IQ"" by Peter David and John DeLancie, but insted we get to see tons of boring, irrelevant scenes, that are structured badly.Meanwhile on the Enterpprise, things progress absolutely nowhere, giving us pages of nothing intellectually, or even emotionally appealing.Irrelevant."
2,Suffers from a bad case of middle-book-itis.,"As is usually the case in the middle book of a trilogy, this book suffers badly from being a story fragment with neither beginning nor ending; at least in the first book of a series, we get a beginning, and in the last book, we get a bit of closure. In the middle book, we get nothing but ongoing angst with no intro or settlement. This book is a good example of why serializations of more than two books are unsatisfactory; the series as a whole continues to be of moderate interest, but this book by itself is pretty worthless. Necessary if you're to get from book one to book three, but definitely not worth reading on its own merits."
2,No chemistry,"I tried, but I just didn't feel the chemistry between Molly and Kevin. I felt more chemistry and understanding between Kevin's mom and the painter than Molly and Kevin. Molly came off as really childish and Kevin's character was underdeveloped. Funny read, but fell flat..."
4,Enjoyed this one.,"This is the first book I have read by this author. I enjoyed reading it so much that I plan to read other books by the same author. It was very entertaining and once I got started reading I did not want to put it down. It's lighthearted and fun without being overly simplistic. When I first realized that the main characters were an aspiring writer and a football star, I was not expecting to like them very much. But as it turned out, the characters had more going than that, which made for an interesting story."
1,Offended & Appalled,"I don't offend easily, but I was offended by this latest effort by Susan Elizabeth Phillips. What Molly did to Kevin was unforgivable. That Kevin even speaks to her again was unbelievable. That everyone reviewing this book is giving it 4 & 5 stars appalls and saddens me. How would we react if this had happened to a male loved one? Would we say that it was okay and he should marry the woman who did that to him? I certainly hope that's not true. If the roles had been reserved, would it have ever been published as a ""romance"" and would you have wanted to read it?"
4,I almost threw it out.,"The beginning premise on how Molly and Kevin get together was a little too out there and if I were not stuck in the middle seat of an airplane I would have tossed it.Once you accept this premise like a good sport(?) the book falls into place and my plane ride zoomed by. Kevin and Molly strive for a solution to their problem and when they finally discuss it, it is very poignant. I liked that. There is no mean spirit in this book. The repartee is excellent between Kevin and Molly and Lily and Liam. I needed to know the solution.Well, after the children story prefaces to each chapter, it did seem to come together. Bringing in Phoebe, Cal and their family was great. Those girls were adorable. The baseball game did it for me! Loved it. Lily and Liam were an added hot item. The newly married couple were so funny! Stick with the book and you will enjoy it; I did."
3,not sep's best,"After reading almost all SEP's other books, I had very high expectations for the story of Kevin and Molly. I was more than a little dissapointed with it. I was left feeling like the story never quite reached its full potential.I looved Kevin but it seemed like he was never really fleshed out, there were hints of deep feeling, of a little boy lost but he was left largely unexplored.Molly is another story. In the beginning she was sort of a smart, sassy, insecure and funny young woman. However, towards the middle of the story she kind of deteriorated into a smart mouth, crazy, needy person. The stunts she kept on pulling got kind of tiring as the story wore on. I almost awarded this book four stars in spite of all this but then I remenbered the love scene in which Molly started fantasizing she was someone else while Kevin was making love to her. What the heck was that all about?anyway, I recommend this book only to those who are hard core SEP fans."
4,DAPHNE TRIUMPHS,"Loved the book, especially the subplot with Daphne and Benny, the literary animal characters in the heroine's stories. Ms. Phillips has scored another hit. I love that she fills in the gaps she creates in previous stories. It was fun to have a story for Kevin and Molly, previously introduced to her faithful fans in former books. I look forward to each and every one of this author's books, she never disappoints."
5,Read it TWICE!!,"I've never read a book twice. Right after I finished it, I read it all over again to savor the parts I'd missed. It's spicy, with characters that have issues just like you and I. After reading this book, other books just didn't measure up! Try it yourself."
3,disappointing,"I couldn't wait to read this book after reading ""Nobody's baby but mine"" but I was sooo disappointed. I was hard to see where the characters fell in love. There were a few funny moments but nothing like in ""Nobody's baby but mine"" (which made me laugh out loud and cry). The secondary plot about the older couple didn't flow very well in this book...their relationship really made no sense to me, the whole time I was reading about them I was thinking ""huh?"" Maybe I just didn't understand the humor and the chemistry of the characters, there were parts that i just didn't understand why were in the book..."
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!!!,"This is my FAVORITE BOOK of all time!! I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips books, can't get enough of her!!!!!!!!!!!! MUST READ!"
5,Another great book,I thought this was a really good book. I have not been reading the Chicago Stars books in order. I read It Had To Be You (first in the series) before reading this book. Because Dan and Phoebe are also in this book it was like reading the sequel - 12 years later. It was great!
3,WTF???,"This book is a shoo-in for a place in the WTF Hall of Fame. The plot device that SEP uses to bring H/h together is the most unromantic I've read -- ever. I actually did some research on male physiology, and yes, it can happen, but what the heroine did was so out of character and off the wall, that the whole incident seemed disconnected from the rest of the book. I kept reading because Kevin, the hero, is a really likeable guy, and I was interested in him. Molly, the heroine, is supposed to be a quirky free spirit, but for me she came across as just plain silly. Poor thing, though, she's saddled with an over-protective older sister and brother-in-law. Molly is twenty-seven and Kevin is in his thirties, and her family is still trying to run her private life. I wanted to slap everyone except Kevin who was trying to do the right thing and being impossibly noble.This is strictly a one-time beach or airplane read."
3,A Dud from Susan E?,"I have been a long time fan of Susan E and will willingly gush about ""Heaven Texas"" and ""It Had to Be You"", the predecessors of this novel. Five years ago a girlfriend and I predicted that Kevin and Molly would get together, so needless to say I've been anticipating the release of this book for quite some time.To be honest it was as if Molly was a new person. As a child in ""It Had to Be You"" she came across as intelligent and independent. I was surprised that in this book her character is so silly and childish. I was put off by the bunny slippers, the children's books, and the parent-child relationship that she STILL has with Phoebe. She was too immature and dependent. (Ex. NO BIRTH CONTROL!)The romance itself was also a disappointment. I did not like the forced sex beginning or the fighting. It made their eventual relationship seem unlikely."
3,Buy it if you really a fan of SEP,"Well, I must say that I have eagerly expected to read the story about Kevin Tucker for a long time. SEP has started to be slightly obsessed with weak female characters which surprises me a lot. I am used to read her stories about strong yet tender and somehow independent females. If you read ""Dream a little dream or Nobody's baby but mine, you will understand what I am trying to say. Unfortunately I was not moved by Molly Sommerville. I, too am having trouble understanding what had happened the brilliant Kevin from Nobody's baby but mine. That one was definetly gorgeous and humorous. In this book he is still amazing but lack of that kind of spirit, perhaps because of immature Molly.Just in Heaven, Texas before, this time I, again find most interesting, the romance between the celebrities; Kevin's mother and famous artist.This one is not a real disappointment but, consider your time and preferences as well as money before ordering it."
2,Disappointment!,"Let me start off by saying that I LOVE SEP books. I think she is a fabulous writer and I have been so excited to read this book. However, I was sooooo disappointed by this one. I could simply not like Molly--she was stupid! Truly and literally--an airhead and I did not like the way the book started--how she started her relationship with Kevin. He's a great character and it's almost like he was overshadowed by her reckless behavior. I never thought I would be giving an SEP book a bad review but I am sorry--this one stinks!"
1,Disappointed,"Susan's books have added such joy to my life but this one was very weak. First off, the fact that Molly rapes Kevin is so unbelievable. I can't believe someone as smart and level- headed as Molly would do that. Secondly, there was NO chemistry between these two characters...they acted like brother and sister! I was bored silly.The only saving grace of this book was the subplot between Kevin's mother and the artist. Wow! I felt those sparks :)Borrow, don't buy this book. In fact pick up one of SEP's other books for they are far more romantic and fun!"
2,"Lacking, No Love Story Here","SEP waited to long to write a sequel to all the other ""Chicago Stars"" So it was hard to have total recall of the other characters mentioned in the story that appeared in the other stories. (It Had To Be You, Heaven Texas, Nobody's Baby But Mine and Dream A Little Dream). Molly acted like a child herself most of the time. And her children book characters kept popping up everywhere which gets old real fast. As for Kevin, it was very hard to believe he played football. There isn't a football player I'v seen who would live in ""paintbox cottages"". He acted like a dork, but at least he looks great in a t-shirtMolly and Kevin are hard to believe were a couple. They just didn't click. Not one of SEP best, but please don't let this book turn you off on SEP's other books or books let to come. It's hard to keep a series going that long. As least SEP gave it her best shot."
2,Not as good...,"This story didn't measure up to Susan Elizabeth Phillips standards. There wasn't as much wit, and barely any fire, if any. I liked the Daphne story twists, but the heroine seemed a little contrived and not so well developed. The story dragged. I trudged through it anyway."
1,Warning! Waste of time,"Another SEP bottom feeder. Yes, you see lots of 5 star reviews; here's the test: did you admire First Lady? What? Found it unreadable? Well, pal, if you would like to repeat that experience, try this latest number. Forget a full critique: this book is DUMB, that's all. How could an author get so bad, so fast, after being so good, for so long?"
1,Boring and uninspiring,"I read about half of if and dumped it. It is so boring. I've read SEP's other books before like Nobody's Baby but Mine, Heaven Texas, It had to be You, Dream a Little Dream. Those were much more interesting. This seems like a cheap cop out during a writer's block.My main problem with SEP is that all of her books are the same: This is very similar to Nobody's Baby but Mine: both women trick the men into sleeping with them, women get pregnant, men force them to marry them because they don't want to breed [...], women underestimate sports jocks to be stupid but they prove to be smart, yudda yudda yudda. All of the conversations are the same, it's the same shallow humor that lacks essense and chamistry. While i really liked Nobody's Baby But Mine, this is very poor quality along with Ain't She Sweet.Phillips needs to find a new inpiration and put an end to the Stars series."
3,A pleasure to read...,"Phillips manages to keep interest once more. Her delightful side tracks into a child's story book world, keeps an interesting perspective into Molly's mind. The appearance of former Phillips' characters also keeps the reader's interest. Kind of a reacquainting update on those characters' lives. The only disappointment was that the plot seemed to be more than slightly reminiscent of ""Nobody's Baby but Mine."" The fact that ""This Heart of Mine,"" is supposed to be Kevin Tucker's own story only makes it more of a let down. So the originality of the plot and circumstances the leading lady and heart throb encounter, are extremely questionable. Phillips did a good job, over all, however. I just hope the next Phillips work is more original. She is an excellent author in a genre that is easily repetitive in plot and theme."
4,This Heart of Mine,"I enjoyed Molly's sister's story alot more. Kevin & Molly's first encounter was too improbable and bizarre and made Molly seem flighty and completely irresponsible. It made it difficult to be sympathetic to the consequences of that one encounter. But it had Susan Elizabeth Phillips trademark style of incredible adventures, comedic relief and life changing romantic interludes."
1,SUSAN ELIZABETH PHILLIPS WORST BOOK TO DATE...,"I absolutely disliked this book from the start to the finish. Out of loyalty to the great romance author (I love all of her other books, that I have read so far). Molly, is simply a very annoying character. She rapes the hero in question (an issue never fully discussed in the novel), and she has lasting issues from her unemotional and un-feeling father. Not buying it, not even a little. I bought the daddy issues in Phoebe Sommerville's book with Dan. All of Molly's ""fire alarm"" issues seem silly and the problems of a bored rich girl. She is by far the least relatable of susan Elizabeth Phillips female leads. I double checked, I have read every susan elizabeth phillips novel to date (12-20-10) and this is not only the worst but an embarrassment."
5,The best yet!!!!!!!,"I have read all the books in the Chicago Stars series and this is not only the best out of the series but this is SEP's best yet. I can't wait for her next book. Molly and Kevin make an incredible pair. I wish she would write another book with them as the main characters. If you this and don't fall in love with Molly, your crazy. Same goes for Kevin. I've asked SEP if she has ever considered turning any of her books into movies. She said that Hollywood has knocked on her door, but she doesn't want to. I wish she would, I would love to see all of her charaters in live action."
4,Audiobook is an excellent abridgment of a wonderful story,"After complaining bitterly about novels being condensed into one or two measly casette tapes, I was thrilled with This Heart of Mine. I read the hardback edition first, then listened to the abridged audio book and did not feel cheated on story. In fact, the only misstep by the narrator was her Ricky Ricardo impression when Kevin was demanding an explanation from Molly. Heaven Texas is my favorite SEP book, but all of them I've read have been great."
2,women tricking men ....,"I read Nobody's baby but mine after this book, and wondered why the women always had to trick the men into getting into bed with them. I had no sympathy for Mlly. As Kevin points out, if he had done it to her, it would have been called rape! Understood SEP is a feminist, but this was disgusting. The same way that I found Jane in the previous book disgusting.But she writes well. Have to hand it to her!"
3,Fun!,"I found this little gem of a book at my hairdresser's and brought it along to the hospital when there was a family emergency. It was perfect escapism for me at the time! It is totally delightful and fun to read.Molly is a struggling children's book writer and illustrator. Kevin is the quarterback star of her sister's football team in Chicago. And this is their story. Molly had always been secretly enthralled with Kevin but would have laughed scornfully if anyone else knew. Kevin never knew her till one night when he was banished to Phoebe's cabin at the lake and Molly had run there to work on her latest book.This book is funny and the characters are quirky. It's fun to read and so what if Molly trapped Kevin into a relationship when she got pregnant? It is just a novel and a delightful one to read! It's perfect for anytime really ~~ for me, it helped me stay sane during a stressful time at the hospital. At least I could escape into it!4-9-06"
3,"Entertaining, but a little disappointing","I have to admit that I was disappointed by this book. I liked the Kevin character from Nobody's Baby But Mine, and Molly from It Had to be You.... so what happened to them? I was entertained and found several parts of this book funny, but Molly's actions that force the characters into each other's proximity are pretty preposterous. Also, it was a little disconcerting to find that the intelligent Molly from It Had to Be You turned out to be pretty flakey. It was nice to see the continuing connections between the characters we were introduced to in other SEP books. All in all, This Heart of Mine is a worthy read if you can get past a few bizarre plot points."
3,where's the sasha remix?,"nice cd....i bought it initially for the last track...listed as HYSTERIX ""TALK TO ME"" (sasha's full on master mix"", which is THE sickest song...BUT, the last track isn't this song...does anyone else have this problem? does anyone know where this cd with the tracks listed is?"
4,One of NFL films best! The Carolina Panthers run to the Jan. '04 Super Bowl in Houston,"Excellent (for a change) NFL filmsvideo yearbook of the Carolina Pan-thers run to Super Bowl XXXVIII (Iwas there!) Too bad they didn't win.But that Tom Brady is at least the14th best QB in Pro Football history!Jake Delhomme will win one yet forPanther Nation. Just like he did forGalaxy Nation over across the pond inthe NFL 'AAA's in Europe, in '99 w/Pat Barnes,Mario Bailey,Vern Hippler&Co.;!"
2,"Well, I just don't kno....","Evans sings OK and all and I have to give credit for being so young and having a CD, but I can tell she's young. When you hear her voice then you can automatically say, YEP THATS A KID!! Well, I don't know about you but it's not to pleasant. I like hearing a REAL singing voice. And hers is not a REAL singing voice. So, you can buy this CD and be dissapointed or just wait and save your money to spend on a better singer."
1,SHE NEEDS TO GROW UP A LITTLE MORE!!,"Sorry, but shes young. I think she should hold off. She really needs to wait. I think she will have bigger and more fans. Write now, I mean, WHO IS SHE? Just some pre-teen singer. Shes not big or nothing. Well, OH WELL!!!"
1,Don't like it!!,"I was excited to buy this CD and when I did I was dissapointed, she doesn't sing that well, I mean good enough, but not really GREAT...her voice is to deep. It needs to be lighter. I dont really kno how to explain it but, it's just not my kind of singing voice that I like to hear. SORRY!"
2,JUST READ THE STORY,"My opinion:My class agreed that this didn't capture the power of the actual short story. That may be impossible to do, actually. Somehow the film lacks the depth and charged darkness of the text."
2,Barn Burning,I thought it did a minimal job in translating the narration provided in the book to film. It was over dramatized and I did not like the editing. I do however think that Tommy Lee Jones was absolutely gorgeous back then and brought the character Abner to life.
5,Tried and True!,"I have been using this video for almost 11 years and my K and 1st grade students LOVE it!!! As a P.E. teacher, I am displaced from the gym often for other events and this is the perfect activity to use in a classroom or hallway."
4,kid vid,"This is a very kid fiendly tape. The costumes and animal themes are entertaining, A good tape for kids and parents to do together."
4,Insightful!,"A well-engineered and reliable kitchen appliance, say a toaster oven or a blender, has a certain functional beauty, and so does this book. Authors Mark C. Tibergien and Rebecca Pomering specifically target and serve financial advisers who own consulting firms. Based on their decades of consulting experience, the authors offer sound advice designed to protect - or deliver - any small financial service firm from a fiscal crisis. In the course of doing so, they debunk several myths, such as the notion that you can simply sell your way out of poor financial performance, or that most small firms don't need to borrow to pay for their operations. With an appendix chock full of helpful tools, such as a cash-flow calculator, a sample financial statement and a practice-management assessment questionnaire, this is a useful book for any small consultancy. We strongly recommend this book to financial advisers who know the value of good advice."
4,Nice change from Wilson,"This ball performs well, and is very round, versus others that have slight lopsidedness(is that even a word?). The ball is a tad heavier then most Wilson Evolutions, and some coaches have complained about the weight. But it does meet spec's for NFHS game ball. You'll either love the cover or hate it...it can be slick at first but once it is used a few times it performs great, and cleans easily with paper towel and water. I use these as practice balls for the kids since the weight is a tad heavier, then use a Wilsn Solution for game play."
5,Song 2 ROCKS!,"I ONLY BOUGHT THIS CD BECAUSE OF SONG 2 FROM BLUR.YET, THIS CD SUPRISED ME. I LIKE SPACE LORD, I WALK ALONE,AND DO RIGHT.HOWEVER MY HEART HAS A SOFT SPOT FOR SONG 2 FROM bLuR."
3,Gift,I really know nothing about this item. My future daughter-in-law loves Star Trek. I found the listing for this book while looking for another title (similar) for my daughter.
2,An amusing little book...,"Okay, I confess: I was amused by this book, and since I suspect that that was most of its intention, perhaps I'm being too harsh in giving it only two stars. And yes, there were some legitimately thought-provoking ideas to be found...but only a few. If you can find this book used, cheap, as I did, it's definitely worthwhile for a lark. But there is DEFINITELY NOT enough book here to be worth list price. It is grossly overpriced to capitalize on the Star Trek market, and that's the source of my dissatisfaction."
1,The Most Horrible Book In the Foregin Service Institute,"I don't like to pan something this badly--- But the Barron's Mastering Italian has to be one of the most useless language programs I've ever used. This is particularly disappointing given that their German Series is perfect.The first 1/4 of the book is devoted to the minutia of vowel sounds. It has no examples to speak of, and the tape that accompanies this book actually uses wrong answers intentionally!!! Thus, if you play the tape in your car without benefit of having the book with you, you will actually have incorrect examples played over and over. This obviously leads to confusion.Again, I've used the German, French, and Spanish versions of this series. The Spanish is also disappointing, but the Italian is so horrible that even it looks great.If you buy this, you are libel to frustrate yourself and actually run the risk of losing interest in Italian.Sorry, I wish the news were better."
2,Good in theory,"I had bought these for my young children as I had thought that they would provide an opportunity to have exposure to letters and numbers while playing.It seems that there is just not enough ""different"" about each duck. The only different thing about them is that they have a letter or number on the belly of the duck. Otherwise, they all look the same.The kids would have to be getting better at ""letter recognition"" to play with these....and by that time I would rather have them playing with an alphabet set or a number set with magnets on the refrigerator."
3,Novel Approach....,"Well, what can I say? The Good: The music is phenomenal and the sound is good, but not in 5.1-What gives?. The videos (professionally made) as extras are a welcome edition, but nothing I haven't already seen. The Bad: Oh boy....The venue is smaller than my living room, the video is shot in the most amateurish way possible, and the setting, well, sucks. Not only is the video poorly shot, it is filmed in 16:9 and then crammed into a full-frame appearance. Very sad indeed. The guys in Nov. Doom should have opted for a live album instead of this aberration. The playing and singing really are great-thus the 3 stars, but the video is awful. So bad, in fact, that I just played the music without watching the concert for the whole second half and enjoyed it so much more. For die hard fans only, otherwise take a pass on this one..."
4,Lots of listening pleasure,Lots of great songs on this album you can listen to the whole thing over and over. A great addition to your German collection.
1,Conservative Christians Viewpoint,"I was surprized looking through all the other reviews that there was not one review written from a christian (Bible believing) viewpoint. I watched this video, and listened carfully to the conversations he had with God. Although at times the conversations appear to be in-line with what you would read in the Bible (the most read book of all time), much of the conversation was in direct opposition to the ideas and theology given in the Bible. I did enjoy the story line of someone overcoming adversity. I wanted to warn people out there that if you are a Bible believing Christian, you may be offended by this movie because it does not align with the Bible on some points; it comes across as what I would term new-age. I would suggest that if you want to have your own personal 'conversation with God', get yourself a copy of the bible - any version - and read it."
2,Not really a Christian movie,"This movie is very slow. I mean VERY SLOW. Though the main character is getting ""messages"" from God, there is never any mention about Jesus. In fact, in one scene, the main character is speaking to a New Age church. If you are looking for a strong Christian message, this is NOT the movie for you. I was disappointed."
1,A Great antidote to insomnia!,"I don't know if this is the worst movie I have ever seen, but it certainly deserves a spot in the top five of that dubious list. Spare yourself the two hours and consider doing something meaningful by comparison, like raking the leaves or rotating your tires.My issues with CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD included:* The pace is s..l..o..w.. enough to put you to sleep* The background music is somnolent* The characters are cardboard, two dimensional cutouts* The ""theology"" sounds like New Age pabulum - ""We are all one..."" uh .... OK!* The characters don't make sense. For example, a young redheaded woman comes on to the protagonist and then creeps out later when he expresses an interest in herOther than this, it was a terrific movie!"
1,Not a Christian film,"This movie is not in line with the Bible at all. If you believe the bible, as I do, this movie isn't for you."
1,A SICK perverted twist to biblical truths!,"This book is a SICK, twisted, perverted twist to what God himself would say in conversation. The author has NO respect whatsoever for the word of God. He makes up his OWN answers as he goes along. These pathetic answers can be VERY confusing stumbling blocks for teens (AND adults) who do not yet know God's word. This book is NOT biblical in any way. It's a pathetically sick attempt to draw people away from the true word of God and into a 'worldy and secular' ""Q & A"" session that has absolutely *nothing to do with what God's word actually says.Keep this book AWAY from children, teen or otherwise. There ARE no ""answers"" here. Only mockery and ridicule of God's Holy book and what is TRULY found within it."
5,Incredible,"I found myself on a very spiritual journey that I felt I deeply connected to. I am not sure what else to say other than, WOW!This is not a fast film. You have to be interested in the bigger picture to enjoy this. You will also need to be open-minded or it will carry no impact.I will own a copy of this DVD as well as the book. It was superb and it's philosophy should be cherished, learned and applied."
1,uhhh,the movie was really realy bad i got it because on recommended from the way of the peaceful warrior and it looked good.my mother and i wached it and during the whole movie we wonderd when is it going to get good it never did... bad acting bad over all i didnt feel uplifted even a little bit.
5,conversation with God,"i could not play the DVD, i think its NTC. i need need middle east standard to watch on the TV."
2,Disappointing,I was expecting so much more from this movie. The books were inspiring and the movie just fell flat.
4,DVD Conversation with God,The DVD_CWG I received from Amazon doesn't play on my DVD player. I get answer something about format problem.I think that DVD is for US market and it doesn't work in Europe. DVD player I own playbacks all kind of CD and DVD formats including DivX.Anyway I managed to see the movie using PC.Conversations With God
1,Conversations With God- The books are better !!!,The movie was a waste. The Books were a lot better. Don't ruin the experience continue to read.
2,PJ's Review for Conversation with God,Although the movie has a catchie title I was not exactly thrill by it. More or less if felt like an awareness for homeless people than a conversation with God. And to be honest if one of us had a convesation with the all mighty... I really wonder if your could possible put that on writting less in video. Anyhow I don't recon. God bless. PJ
4,Walking the path,"The difference between this movie and other spiritual films (The Secret, What the Bleep, Celestine Prophecy) is that this movie shows you how to be, what to do, and how to get to god. It demands that the spiritual walk is one of compassion and human commitment, and not one of manifesting a million dollars overnight or learning how to heal plants or move atoms with your mind. This very human message will come as a disappointment for some who are looking for a get-spiritual-quick scheme from this movie. This is not a film about spiritual giftedness, it is a film about walking your very human walk, dealing with the opportunities for compassion that we pass on our way to work every morning, and learning that every moment is an opporunity to live your own conversation with god."
2,Was more about the making of the book than the book itself,"I was disappointed with the movie quite a bit.... I was expecting the movie to involve more of the content, depth, emotion of the books rather than just be a movie about his life while he was writing the books. Almost seems like a marketing piece for the book. It unfortunately seems to fit quite well with pyramid schemes, and those online marketer types who have secrets of making money online only to never have any legitimate business other than teaching other people how to make money online.Absolutely nothing against Mr. Walsch OR the books. The movie just felt very much lacking.For a spiritually enlightening movie, I would recommend 'Peaceful Warrior' instead.Or just read the books."
2,Conversations with God DVD,"Item arrived on time and it was well wrap. I was aware of Movie being in USED conditions. Unfortunately it was not only USED, but DVD was also ""Scratched"". I didn't get to see the full movie due to the heavy scratches on DVD. I don't think I will never buy a USED DVD from this seller again. Sorry, bad experience."
3,"READ CWG BOKKS 1, 2, & 3 and they will change your life..",I found the books to be much more inspirational than the movie. The movie is about Neale donald walsch and offers insight into how difficult his life was but leaves out many parts and is hard to follow. The relationship they hint at with his mother is also confusing.
3,Not bad but..,"The video is mostly about Neale's personal experiences and really barely touches upon the message's expressed through the books. Nevertheless, the movie is reasonable on it's own and is probably not bad as an introduction for some people."
2,Disappointing,"Way too ""sweet"". I expected much more dialogues and philosophical conversations, but it turned to be quite kitsch, with lots of violins in the background.If I thought of reading the book, the movie totally discouraged me to do it."
5,We are God and we are one.,"Conversations With God is a good movie for individuals whom still have the open minds they were born with. I totally believe in this movie and I'm going to order books based on this film. If your a person stuck in one book or captured by a religious organization, then this spiritual movie may not fit into your way of thinking. I thirst for information of this type, because I know God exist for a fact, and known all the while that all life comes from the creator. Spiritual gifts are happening all around us, just as they happened to this guy, but because of unseen people we don't get to see or enjoy them, we're only shown the bad news, so it can purpetuate corruption in society. If this film was viewed with the open mind we were born with, the world would be a better place."
3,Conversations With God,This is a spiritual movie and it affects each person differently. I enjoyed the movie and I am sure that I will enjoy the book as well.
1,Conversations with God,"I enjoyed the books in the series so I was excited when I saw the video and ordered it immediately. The video basically recounted how Neale Donald Walsch hit rock bottom and pulled himself back up out of dispair and being a homeless person to someone with a bestselling book and financial freedom. The video was done in a series of flashbacks that were irritating after awhile. I was disappointed that the scenes with Walsh giving talks, he appeared facetious and extremely self serving in his lectures. I would never have bought the video if I had been able to rent and watch the video. It is not one that I would have especially wanted in my collection."
3,Conversations with God DVD,"Movie was just ok. I guess I was expecting more because the books were so inspiring. Was kind of dissapointed - would reccomend the read, great books."
3,"Well, well, well - Len Tridge finally made it into print",The obsessive who knew every stop on every single bus route in Manchester has written...er...an obsessive book....
1,The book is not intuitive,"I am a computer programmer and had to use this book as a requirement for CIS class for my MBA degree. In my class I did not meet a single person who liked the book or found it satisfactory. I don't claim that I know everything about MIS. But the terms I knew are not explained well in the book. And it is very hard to understand terms I did not know. To illustrate my point, here is book's definition of the term `hypertext markup language (html)' - ""Page description language for creating Web pages and other hypermedia documents."" In my opinion you don't explain word `hypertext' with `hypermedia'. ""Page description language for creating Web pages"" doesn't sound intuitive either. Most of the definitions sound like that. The only positive thing was that Book Store gave me 50% of the book price back when I returned it."
3,"Informative, but dry and not an easy read","It's informative, but it's sure a snoozer. The cases are the most interesting part of the book. Also, I think it makes some strong claims which are not true in many situations. In this industry, you should never say ""This is the way it is everywhere"" because by tomorrow something will have changed.As an instructor, I would use it as a good book to pull examples and cases out of. As a student, I'd study the bold words and try and stay awake for the rest of it."
5,"Managers, Sales Rep.'s, MBA-students.... this is a must have","The emphasis of this book is how organizational change is required to implement an information system. At this point, we have all been involved in new implementations or updates to existing implementation. This book addresses logical approaches to managing the organization during these changes.This book is **not** for techical administrators; however, it is an ideal resource for the non-technical manager who oversees a technical team, a technical business, or who wants to see the business grow to the Internet or use EDI type processes.Because it uses current cases to introduce concepts about networking, it would be ideal for a graduate business program.Because it is well written and clearly defines the key elements of networking, it would be a great desk reference for any business oriented manager or sales rep."
1,Management Information Systems,I had to read this book for a graduate-level class. It's content is actually more suitable for the high-school level. The text's focus on artificial categories and terms does a disservice to someone actually trying to learn about information systems.
1,Don't get it.,This book is just not good. I don't recommend it. It's too complicated in my opinion. I used to use this book at junior college.
4,Helpful and Useful,"It is helpful for people who just start learning about MIS. However, content looks too fancy."
1,Reviewing the reviews,"...two (7th) editions are available. One of these (7th) editions comes with a CD and one doesen't. In addition, one ISBN # will not necessarily lead to the other. Finally and more importantly, Are the CD's more useful?Does this create different text? If so, is it significant enough to infleunce choice due to use/needs. Given that this book is suposed to be about Management Information Systems, I'd have to say the information concept needs some work."
2,Another hard-to-understand stats book,"This book was found to be difficult to use by myself and other students in my MBA program. We are currently looking for an easier-to-understand book that is advanced enough for an MBA program. Our accompanying Schleifer/Bell book appears to be much easier to understand, although it doesn't cover all of the same topics.However, I don't regret buying this book...I typically buy the textbooks for my classes, especially if I can get them for a reasonable price."
5,On Drugs Raises Interesting Points,"On Drugs raises many fascinating issues about drugs in American society. Lenson begins by exploding the myth of a Drug-Free America, and pointing out why the ""War on Drugs"" has failed, and a brief history of human drug use and American attitudes towards outsiders. One of the most interesting chapters is about drug use as a regression to childhood, and the chapter on stimulant abuse is chilling. Sometimes the author's concerns about consumer society seem to reek of liberal paranoia, but for the most part an excellent book"
3,Almost a Great Book,"This is almost a great book! It provides a lot of great factual information about psychoactive compounds, a subject that is usually ignored. Much of the book is very interesting and very readable. However, when the word ""Consumerism"" enters a paragraph it becomes basically unreadable. There were times, because of this, that I almost gave up on the book."
3,its okay,was needed and received quickly for school keep up the good work on your end as much needed for home school kids
2,Joe Cinque's Consolation,"As an avid true crime reader, I must say I was quite disappointed in this book.Realising that true crime must closely follow the course of events of what actually occurred it is also paramount that this is woven into a story that captures the readers attention and there is no doudt that this case had all the ingredients to do this .My impression was that this book was constructed nearly in its entirety from court transcripts .So much more could have colored this book if the author had spent more time in interviewing some of the other people who wereInvolved on the fringes. A missed opportunity."
5,THE BEST CD OF PROKOFIEV'S CHAMBER MUSIC AT A BARGAIN PRICE!!,"I've been collecting recordings of Prokofiev since the early 1970s (LPs in the '70s, and of course CDs starting in the mid '80s). This is the BEST disk of the chamber music of Prokofiev I have ever heard! (And, at a ridiculously low price - actually, it's a 'steal'!). I'm referring to the MUSIC, the PERFORMANCES, and the SOUND. Everything comes from Russia - the compositions, the musicians, and the recording. And to make this CD even more attractive, it's very generous (over 72 minutes). You will not find better performances of Prokofiev's String Quartets, the Quintet, and the Overture (thankfully, the original chamber version - not! the later bloated orchestral version), anywhere else, period! This CD is a must-own. I hope this review was helpful in your collecting Prokofiev."
4,Good condition for a used book.,"Yes, it met my expectation for a used book. Only there is one mistake . The text on the page 31/32 is upside down. Otherwise, the book is in the good condition, printed on a strong paper. I like it. B"
4,Great reference,"The illustrations are a wonderful source of reference and inspiration for the beginning and intermediate painter. There are plenty of examples to get you started if you're thinking of trying something new and aren't quite sure how to approach it. The sections I find myself using all the time are trees and human elements.I learned from a teacher when I was living in Japan, so the bad translation doesn't bother me. I use this book for the images, which is what you really should buy it for. If you want something more of step-by-step instruction for the very beginner, this book isn't it."
5,Wonderful resource,I am a student of Chinese painting and this book was recommended by our teacher as the most reliable reference book for Chinese painting. I am very pleased with this purchase since it is everything that I expected.
3,Not what I hoped for,"Listeners should beware that these are not all the originals from the TV shows, most notably the Park Avenue Beat, Hill Street Blues theme, Green Acres and Petticoat Junction. However, Syncopated Clock, Bandstand Boogie and I Love Lucy are the real deal and enjoyable. Most disappointing was Park Avenue Beat (them from Perry Mason Show). I would love to find the original, driving, brassy theme but cannot locate it anywhere on this site or elsewhere. Any suggestions?"
5,"Oldies, but Goodies to Remember","I loved this CD. It was enjoyable to hear again the songs that made TV so great!! I would like to find another edition, if it exists, with more themes, like The Lone Ranger, Mary Tyler Moore, and The Man from Uncle themes."
4,Aquamarine,Aquamarine is a book about two young girls Hayley and Claire who spend everyday in the summer together. They wanted to spend time together because Claire was moving to Florida with her grandparents. A huge storm came and washed into the pool and the girls found Aquamarine and took care of her. Aquamarine wanted to do everything Heather and Claire did.My Favorite part of the book is when Aquamarine and Raymond go on a date. She has to get rolled in a wheel chair because of her tail. SHe gave Haley and Claire had three wishes. When the third wish is done Aquamarine has to go back and live with her family.I would reccomend Aquamarine if you need a short read. The downside of the book is that it is not detailed a lot. You can relate to the book if you best friend is moving.
5,"Alice Hoffman's Aquamarine, a Review from Victoria","Anyone can read this book!!! I think it is a great book about 2 girls who are about to be separated, a mermaid in love and a big storm. It was one of the best stories I have read and I would rate it 6 stars if I could!!!!!!!!!!"
2,A Horrible Terrible Book,"This book really stunk. The idea is good; two girls, one is moving away, everything is changing, the girls find a mermaid in the swimming pool, there is romance, the mermaid goes back, the girl moves, the end. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one. But of course, the glitch. the print is huge. The wording is boring. There is no reason to buy this book unless you are a 6 year old girl that is obsessed with fantasy."
2,Aquamarine,"Am I the only reader who was disappointed in this title? As a long-time fan of Hoffman, I was expecting something lyrical and original; I found Aquamarine rather pedestrian. I am a YA librarian and I doubt my students will be enthusiastic about Hoffman's first venture into this market."
3,Aquamarine...,"Well, this book would probably be great for a little 10-year-old, but when I picked up the book I kinda expected more. It was more like... well, it was pretty boring in my opinion. Aquamarine was a really rude mermaid from the start of the book and from the way they described Raymond, I expected him to not like her. Oh well, I'll just go back to reading my L.J. Smith books."
1,NO!,"Nothing like the movie. Usually the books are better than the movies, this time it was the other way around! Too short and boring. And the characters were switched around!"
3,Aquamarine,"This book was cute. I purchased it for an [...] girl. She enjoyed it. However, the book seemed so incomplete, if you compare it to the movie. It's strange, it's usually the other way around. The story is cute, don't get me wrong; but if you want a more complete version, you're better off just watching the movie. I know this was her first attempt at making a ""children's novel"" but, come on, kids are a little smarter than just a few chapters slapped together. My daughter was capable of absorbing more from the book, the book should have had more to give!"
3,Magically enchanting.,"Excellent book for young teens. The author put some real poignant things in this writing that I don't think the younger reader will absorb, but maybe when they go back and read it again it will strike chords."
1,"terrible, awkward, & stupid","This book is not worth your time or money. The Book really is boring and ends by (obviously) the mermaid geting back to the water, and, (duh) and the guy goes with her. There was basically no plot, and I do not see how this book proves the friendship thing."
2,Aquamarine:Alice Hoffmans first failure,"I can't believe everybody liked this book! The characters were vapid and airheaded and the plot was pointless. A few innocent moments and sweet ideas give this book two stars instead of one, but mostly the characters were boy-crazy and unrealistic, and the writing with droning and simple language. I do not reccomend this book. It is so dumb how the plot was to get Aquamarine, the stuck up mermaid, on a date with Raymond the ""cute"" guy behind the snack bar at the Capri Beach Club. If you want to waste your time, read this book. If you want an adventurous, nonsteryotypical novel, read The Wind Singer."
3,Aquamarine -- a romantic fantasy,"Alice Hoffman is one of the greatest writers alive today; I adore her books because of their richness of plot and character. This book offers the promise of more, but it doesn't deliver because it is so economical with its text.This is a fine romantic short story, washing over the reader with beautiful language, but I don't think many children will choose it on their own."
2,Aquamarine,"I must say that I was very sorely disappointed. Aquamarine is supposed to have travelled from the sea into a swimming pool where two best friends have spent the summer at supposedly to find love though you get more of a sense that she simply attempting to explore the human world. The only problem is that her body can't stand the chlorine in the pool let alone being on land.The real problem is Aquamarine's attitude. The author does mention that she'd been spoiled all her life and she acts rather ungrateful about everything. Then in the end, the two best human friends have no choice but to take Aquamarine back to sea probably never to see her again. How disappointing!"
5,Mermaids are real,"In the beginning of the book, Hailey and Claire were discussing Claire moving. Hailey doesn't want Claire to move, but she has to. They met a cute boy named Raymond. A hurricane came and destroyed the whole beach. Both of the girls helped clean up the beach. At the end, Claire moves to Australia. The girls promise to visit each other.This story takes place at the beach in modern times. The main problem of the book was Claire and Hailey arguing about Claire moving. At the end they were not angry with each other.I like the book because there was a mermaid named Aquamarine, and she is so funny."
4,Great Storytelling,This is a very good story of the last adventure between two friends. An event that will bond them together forever. Alice Hoffman is a great story teller who has crafted a magical tale of youth and fantasy.It is a very quick read for adults and definately aimed at the younger crowd but hits it mark with great style.
2,Empty - Marine,"Though this short story had a good basic theme and had the positive aspect of Hailey and Claire's strong friendship, the plot was completely without substance. Instead of finding a meaningful way of persuading Aquamarine to return to her ocean home, Hailey and Claire set her up on a date with a cute guy! Personally, I think that Ms. Hoffman could have come up with something more interesting and certainly something more meaningful. On the other hand, if you are looking for a mermaid story with REAL substance, try Liz Kessler's ""The Tail of Emily Windsnap"" (or for a different approach, Karen Hesse's ""The Music of Dolphins""). Good try, Ms. Hoffman, but readers are better off with some other, more meaningful book."
3,Meh?,"While ""Aquamarine"" is a gorgeous little book, I wasn't exactly happy with it. First of all, it's so short! It really isn't a novel, just a long short story. It is definitely geared towards younger readers (7-10 years) and I felt a bit -- insulted? -- at parts because Hoffman was so *simple* in her descriptions and characterizations.The book itself --or at least the hardcover version-- is very cool, with a waterproof cover and that eerie photograph on the slipcover. The watercolor illustrations fit the mood of the book, but again are too simple for my liking. If you really want to read this, I suggest checking it out at a library first. I don't regret buying my copy, but I was a bit disapointed.A great gift book for younger kids who enjoy stories of merfolk and the like, and it looks so cute on a bookshelf. An okay book for an afternoon at the beach."
1,Don't buy download version,"You have to manually go through all of the testimonials about how great the instructor is each time just to get to the yoga, which is exceedingly irritating and not worth it at all. There's no refund or exchange option for digital orders (that I could find), so I'm stuck with something I'll never use. Maybe the DVD version is programmed by chapters so that you can go directly to the real stuff, but the digital download isn't."
2,Yoga with Barbara is the Best,Yoga with Barbara is the best! She is fun and caring and concerned that her participants meet their goals of a better/stronger life. Her class sets the mood for attaining the best you can be. The DVD provides guidance on strength and calmness in this crazy busy world. Thanks Barb and to those looking for a DVD-- GO FOR IT!
3,get what you pay for,"Don't cost alot but the quality is marginal - typical Chinese. Very wide construction - I'd say size these about 1/2 size smaller than normal unless you plan to wear lots of socks. If you consider these for use for a season or two with no expectations beyond that point, you'll probably be satisfied."
1,Duck boots,"These Duck boots are worthless. I ordered a size 11, which the length was fine, but the width was almost big enough to put both feet in. You can't tell which is the right foot or the left foot. They seem to be made for either foot.I just feel I wasted my money. Glad they were not too expensive."
3,Size problem,The size 12 boot I bought was way too big despite it being the appropriate shoe size. I sent it back to Sportsman's Guide for size 11 which is just a bit too small in the length. Too bad they don't make 1/2 sizes.
4,Duck Boots,"Fit well and seem heavyduty.Look well madeHopefully I will get longlasting use of them, as my last pair from another company cracked at the bend point.Awaiting bad weather(first snow storm) to wear them. Will let you know more after this."
2,Didn't Last,"A nice shoe for the price when I got them in July 2006, But by November 2006 both shoes leak.I wear them 15 minutes per day to walk my dog and both shoes have splits in the upper portion that make them leak."
3,It cooked the chikens,I bought this little oven at an estate sale today for the low low price of $18.00 which was about 10 dollars to much I think. I got it to help hatch chickens from the eggs out of our barn. I put 6 eggs in the oven and turned it to the lowest setting and left for a couple of hours. When I got back from the bar I heard screaming coming from the oven and by the time I got into the kitchen all the baby chikens had exploded. Don't buy this oven if you like little chickies
1,So terrible we call it my archnemesis...,"I don't think I have ever disliked an appliance more than this toaster oven. It takes FOREVER to toast, 5+ minutes for two English muffins. The worst part is that machine MUST BE BABYSAT at all times while it is taking it's sweet time to toast.. here is why:*Toasting is crazy inconsistent - I tested using old bread to prove to my fiance that it was not user error. I turned the dial to the same position each time. Each try yielded different results. Sometimes it was undercooked, most times it burned, one time it was perfect.*Does not toast (or burn) evenly on both sides.*Randomly, the dial will stop and the machine will TURN OFF. This usually happens about mid way through toasting.*FIRE HAZARD - Randomly, the dial will stop and the machine will STAY ON. This also happens about mid way through.The only pro is that the crumb tray and racks are easy to take out and clean. Please, get another machine if you are in the market for a toaster oven."
2,This toaster oven takes FOREVER to toast!,"Nice looking - and probably does a decent job on baking and such... however, I dont plan on keeping it long enough to find out. It takes a LONG time to heat up and lightly toast a single piece of bread. I was upgrading from my old Black and Decker which only had 1 shelf - thinking I could cook more toast faster with 2 shelves..... I was wrong. It would take less time to toast 2 seperate batches with my old toaster oven then it takes to do a single piece of toast - light - in this one. It's going back today... I miss my black and decker!**** and yes, I did read the instructions - carefully and more than once"
4,"A good book - enough to get you through the exam, but ...","This book is a nice, concise summary of MOST of the material you'll see on the exam (I passed it on the first try with just this book) - however, this book totally ignores ""Macros"", and there are at least three questions on the exam about them. My advice: read the book, study macros on your own, and you'll do fine !!"
4,"Between 3 & 4 stars, but there are no better books on market","This book does an excellent job of explaining most of the exam requirements; however, there are a few suprises. You need a good working knowledge of Access or you need to search through other Access books for info on switchboards and macros before you attempt the exam. Good luck!"
3,"OK,but...","Although well written, this study guide is not on par with the others in the QUE series. I found four mistakes in the first ten lessons. For example, you would use Control+'(Apostrophe) to have Access repeat the data from the previous record's field, not Control+;.Topics are not well organized as there are often references to areas that will be covered later in the lesson or indeed later in the book. The lack of a section covering macros is a definite drawback for those preparing for the MOUS exam and I agree with one of the previous reviewers complaints about the CD files being read-only.Fine as a general reference and ""How To"", but as an exam prep I would pass."
4,I passed on my first try!,"The book was great! Not only did it give me a study guide for the test, but I learned a couple new things along the way! Only thing I would add is to study Macros in addition to this book."
2,I was disappointed because the lessons were not hands on.,"Though the lessons go step-by-step, this is of no value unless you have a file open to do those steps. I did the practice labs after using two other books with hands-on exercises. Some of the ""things to do"" in the labs are not clearly written: Example-at the end of Lesson 3 ""View the tables in the Table tab as Large Icons, Small Icons, File List with Details, and File List with Properties."" File List with Properts is not one of the view options from the Table tab. This option is available when you click File, Open. Then your view options are Lists, Details, Properties and Preview.Lesson 4 Lab has the following. ""Use AutoForm to enter the data in Table 4.3"" AutoForm can only be used to create forms, not to enter data. The statement should have been ""Type the data in Table 4.3 into the form you created with AutoForm"" or something to that effect.Overall, this book is not what I would expect from an exam preparation guide."
3,"Good book,pity about the CD",I'm hoping to do my Access Expert exam in about 3 weeks and so far I'm quite disappointed with this book. The most infuriating thing is that the databases are read-only which means that you can't really practise the exercises they give you. However I've noted the previous reviewer's comment about switchboards and will prepare accordingly .
2,---DON;T BUY THIS ONE---,"I bought a Master ""Word Lock"" cable to replace a lighter Master ""Key-Lock"" cable for my bicycle. The retainer ring that attaches to the bicycle broke after a couple of weeks of usage. I exchanged it for another one, and even though I was extra careful to not over-tighten it when installing, it also broke after about a week of usage. I then compared that part with the mounting device that came with the previous lighter Master cable key-lock model and noticed that the plastic ring that mounts to the bicycle is thinner in the heavier ""Word Lock"" model. I guess Master decided to save some money. Too bad.Comments from Robert in Houston"
3,lock,this lock is nice because it allows you to choose and change the word that opens it. it would be more versitle with more than four letter places and more letter keys though
2,really bad: are your kids stupid?,"This book is as bad as some b sci-fi movies. They call them""killer tomatoes""...There are just a lot of factual errors like Manhattan is an islandand can't be moved like a boat without breaking apart.I suppose a lot of this stupid dialog with his parents is supposed to be funny: it is mostly just sad.Maximum Boy is a bust for me as a superhero."
5,Perfect Fit and Easy to use,Bought this sunshade several months ago after reading the reviews. I was a little worried that it would not fit or be difficult to use because of some reviewers. The shade has an exact fit for my Rav4 and the quality is excellent. I would recommend this item.
2,Poor fit...too big.,Uses much better materials than the ones at the store. It's way too big for our RAV4. This was supposed to be a custom fit. They either sent the wrong product or need to redesign this one. It's just barely usable.
3,Not what I expected,"Recently I read Sacred Land, Sacred View, about the Navajo relationship with the land. I thought -- based on the title -- that this book would continue along the same line and help the non-native appreciate the native views. Instead, this is a book of essays which -- while interesting -- were not what I hoped for.I would recommend this book to a friend as similar to the Craig Childs' books, without the archeological focus."
5,Salley a writer in Hartwell,"I discovered ""Listen Here"" while browsing with girlfriends in a bookstore in Spruce Pine, N.C. this past weekend. I was completely charmed by the book's contents. So much so, that while I and my four friends ran errands around town,I read selections from the book from the backseat of the car. We laughed and cried over the things I read, identifying so well with the stories, feelings and images of women's everyday lives which are so eloquently depicted in ""Listen Here."" This is a wonderful addition to any library of fine, deeply-felt writing. Men will enjoy it; women will celebrate it.I am in the process of publishing my own book and hope that it will touch readers the way this book has touched me. Congratulations to Sandra Ballard and Patricia Hudson - you've produced a masterpiece. That's all I have to say before the season starts - a line which will make sense to you if you read ""Listen Here."""
5,Listen Here: Women Writing In Appalachia,"For students and devotees of Appalachian literature, this book, along with BLOODROOT, should be required reading. Not only is it enjoyable reading, it guides the reader toward additional Appalachian books to be enjoyed."
2,I was disappointed in this book,Because it only reviewed those places that were more costly then those I could afford. I have done research on several places myself and there are several less costly but still desireable places to live. It would have been helpful to me to see a more varied survey.
3,outstanding style for who?,"I like the way the author rates places - the criteria are good, the descriptions are good. My main complaint is that it is too East coast centric. I don't have the book in front of me, but there are more places listed for Florida than California.Ok, I live in California, so I'm biased, but my parents live in Florida & I've been there in the summer. Yuck.I just wish he had aimed his well written descriptions at a more balanced look at the country. Personal choice I guess"
5,Some of my favorite cities,"When I think of retirement cities, I think of towns and cities, both large and small, that have great spirit and lots of choices of things to do -- something for everyone. That is what attracts a wide cross-section of people, which adds to the charm of a place. Dr. Bland has done a wonderful job of capturing that image of his selected cities.Of course, I loved it that my city, Portland, Oregon, was ranked very high -- but I was equally attracted to many of his write-ups of other cities we have visited and loved.Although Dr. Bland gives equal weight to each criteria, you could easily add ""weightings"" to his numbers for criteria that are most important to you. This would obviously ""shuffle"" his rankings, depending upon your weightings.This book is a great, well thought out guide to selecting a new place to live for anyone considering a move -- whether for retirement or not."
3,The small folk cannot retire in Style,"1. The American cities reviewed are unaffordable for a middle-income person unless one is ready to accept less safe locations.2. We ended up retiring in style in South America where our pension makes us live in comfort, without snow or extreme summer temps and relative safety.There are many locations outside the USA where one could retire in style, modernity and safety with from- modest-to-average pensions. (Including medica facilities)"
2,FOR THE RICH LIFESTYLE,"Very limited in scope, the title says it all. A good conversation piece for those who desire that lifestyle."
5,How to retire in style,Well organized and easy to read...great for the potential retiree to make well informed decisions. Have recommended it to my friends
4,Personalized Marine Mom Sweatshirt,I was satisfied with this item in order to visibly show my pride in being a Marine Corp parent who has a child deployed currently in Afghanistan.
5,Absolutely Mesmerizing,"Spellbinding, primal, impelling and intoxicating. You will be compelled to quickly garner the other four and eagerly await future releases. Every CD is awesome. Only superlatives can describe this music. Highly addictive. Pure ecstasy."
3,Pro's and Cons,"I have large hands, don't see as well as I used to, am not the perfect touch typist, and have to type in diminished light at times. I miss the old wider P/S2 boards that at least gave you more room to maneuver. I got this because of the larger print on the keys (as opposed to the larger keys which are much more expensive), the The Black and Yellow constrast, and generally I found it a comfortable and quiet keyboard. DON'T be fooled by all those hot keys at the top row, they do not work in an XP setting (really I don't know where they work).Why am I getting a new one? Well I spilled some water on it and unlike many keyboards where you just wipe it and then let it hang upside down to dry, this one actually shorted out! Just so you know!"
5,Great Keyboard,I ordered two of these keyboards for nursing home residents. They are easy to use and have provided the independence for the residents to type and use the computers on their own with minimal assistance. They work as well as the keyboards I replaced. I would recommend these to anyone.
4,Buy this only if you really need it.,"I bought this keyboard for improved visibility in what can sometimes be dim lighting.This is not a good reason to buy this keyboard.This keyboard is a specialty unit with VERY large and easily readable key labels for those with visual impairments that really need that very large labelling.The key action is quite slow for a modern keyboard and somewhat disappointing. [Am a trained touch typist].I donated it to a local Senior Center, and the person who got it was very delighted--they are visually impaired and the very large labels were more important to them than the rather slow key response."
2,So far impossible to program the special keys,"Stardard keyboard with large keys, But the special key function behave very bizarely, and do not seem to work with any of the standard Microsoft configurations. The instructions offer no help. Supposedly it will work perfectly out of the box without the enclosed software with Win XP, but I found that not to be true. I am sure there is a fix for all this, but so far I have not found it. Why not just provide a proper driver in the first place??"
5,EXCELLENT for some with vision impairments,"I purchased one of these for our village / community center (senior citizens Multiservice Retirement Community) for those with vision impairments - we have received a number of positive comments from users. They love the visibility and character size in particular, and it has opened possibilities for a number of homeowners and residents - shopping, reading news, e-mail, communicating with children and friends.Essentially, as a plain vanilla everyday USB keyboard easier to see by many, I highly recommend this keyboard. So much, I purchased yet another..."
3,"OK, for big letters, I'd give it a 2/1/2 starts if i could","We bought 3 of these.White keys.After a couple of months, it went bad. You could nottype anything with it. It would fill in any text withcontinuous letters, like it had stuck keys.Black keys.We received a keyboard, that had two ""H"" keys.The ""R"" key was also labeled as ""H"".How could this happen?Yellow keys.Best of the 3 I think. No problems.Like the bold letters, which is why we bought them.Wife and I both have bad eyesight.We've had these now for about a year.Not so sure I would buy these again."
3,Good but moving away from what they did best,"I would put Deacon Blue's sound in with other groups such as 80's EBTG, Prefab Sprout,etc. I fell into them in 1991 while living in Germany. I picked up the hard to find double CD 'Ohh Las Vegas and that was love at first listen. They are melodic, treble filled with poetic words to strenghten the sound. Whatever you say... was apparently their last offering and it had that big america production rock and roll sound and it lost some or most of that musty closeness that earlier works had. If you can find it grab Our Town their greatest hits and if you like this, go back and find all their early stuff. Bands don't sound like this anymore because the world is a changing. My life is better for having listend to Deacon Blue. The song Dignity, actually finds a way to bless the word musically. Unreal"
2,loved it at first,i really really loved this for my son he LOOOOOOOOOVES to jump whether hes in a jumper or not he would go crazy in the jumperoo but i was very upset one day he was jumping away and i heard a loud snap and before i could even jump up the entire thing folded and collapsed with him in it he fell forward and really could have been hurt...luckily he wasnt. im not quite sure why this happened but it totally turned me off from this toy
3,Try it before you buy it!!,"I have a very active son after reading the reviews and hearing other parents rave about the Jumperoo I decided to buy it. Unfourtunatly my son really didn't like it that much. I thought that I needed to adjust the height and I tried it at various levels (I think that they should put in the insturctions the recomeneded height- should only the toes touch the ground, flat footed etc.) but nothing really seemed to get him jumping! He does like the music it plays and the lights but he was never really satisfied. I am disappointed with the toy since it was pretty expensive. I would recommend trying to find a friend who has it and let your baby try it out before you buy. On the plus side selling it used on Craigslist you can get about half your money back."
4,Great exercise for baby,This item was a great fit for my child. She took a little getting used to the springs and getting off the ground. But as soon as she did she loved it. Great way to exercise her little legs.
5,Gymtastics Jumperoo awesome!!,"My 5 month old adores this thing. The adjustable straps are so nice to have. It is bigger than I had thought it would be, but no biggie. I would recommend one to everyone."
5,Lots of fun!,"I purchased the jumperoo for my second child. He had the doorway jumper but his two year old brother kept pushing him in it like a swing. The doorway jumper wasn't safe so I went out and got the jumperoo. It proved to be a GREAT investment! It is so much safer than that doorway jumper. It also makes sounds and has toys on it too. My son LOVED it! I got it when he was about 5 months old and he used it up to about 10 months. It's very easy to adjust the legs to various heights as your baby grows. The only complaints that I have is that this jumperoo is very large and takes up a lot of floor space. It stays in place on carpet, but when we put it on hardwood, my son jumped so wildly, that the jumperoo slid around on the floor. Overall, a must have baby item!"
5,Great fun for everyone,This definitely merits a great review. My son was first unsure how this works but it took him a day or two to figure it out. Now he loves it! It is a great way of him releasing energy. I would highly recommend this!
4,Great exercise for the little ones,I bought this a few months ago for my now 5 month old. This is really a great product to get the little ones moving. My infant loved it right from the start and will literally bounce until he falls asleep sometimes. He truly loves it.The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish it could fold up a little so you could take it with you.I know my little guy misses it when we travel anywhere.
5,AMAZING MOMMY LIFE SAVER!!!,"I have a very active four month old and he can not get enough of his jumperoo! He was never content just sitting in a bouncy seat or laying on a blanket, or even in the swing. He could be in his jumperoo playing for hours. He and I have so much fun with it, and he chuckles the whole time he is in it. Moms out there need to get one!"
4,"Great, but watch your kiddo","Our daughter LOVES this toy. It's great for the baby who loves to stand all the time and the parent who just can't hold her enough.The one problem that we had with the toy is that her hands would get stuck in the leg holes even when we were keeping our eyes on her. All of a sudden, her hands were no longer playing with the toys or up in the air and we would peek under the jumparoo and see them dangling out the leg holes. :) It never seemed to bother her, but we decided to stuff one of her blankets or a towel in front of her to fill the gap in the seat area so that her hands couldn't fall through anymore.I have a picture posted to illustrate what I am talking about.Despite this issue, I would buy this toy again without a second thought."
5,Fabulous Fun,My 4 month old daughter loves it!!Pro's1. Color scheme keeps the child interested even when not jumping2. Safe and secure with adjustable heights3. Easily folded to store4. Good springing action5. Good for both indoor and outdoor useCon's1. Very Large2. Lights and music not always activated with jumpingOverall a fantastic exercise toy for your child upon their holding their head up.
5,Brings back good memories,"For years the name and type of this tea has been eluding me. I can recall my mother always buying and making it but once the store stopped selling it we never got a taste of it again, and with a few years the name faded from memory. It was with the help of a cashier at a tea shop who told me most likely I was thinking of Oolong tea. A quick search and a spark of memory brought me to Foojoy China Classic Oolong tea.The smell of the tea before and after seeping is just as I remember it, aromatic, soothing, and strong. And the taste is wonderful, when others review it having a great balance it's very true, smooth, flavorful but not over powerful or weak that walks the line between green and black tea perfectly. The rest of the world can go about enjoying their green tea everything fad classic Oolong is all that I want and need."
2,Sticking with whole leaf,The first few bags were good but thereafter it had a grassy aftertaste. It is good enough to mix with fruit juice but straight up it does not pass.
2,Cheap plastic,"Mine broke in the first week. Also, I didn't feel confident it will hold my phone for very long."
5,Great album that time forgot,"This has remained one of my alltime favorite records, after 15+ years. It's a shame this was The Grays only album, because what a record it was. Melodic, powerful, just great to listen to. This one has really stuck with me over the years, and it amazes me how few other people remember this band."
2,Disappointing,"When Lynn Pan tells the stories of her family's past, the work is riveting, but too often she inserts herself in the story. Not only does it fracture time in a confusing way (unlike the way Chang-Rae Lee fractures time to a purpose), but it interupts the through line, making it difficult to remember where we are in the overall story. There are too many excellent books about modern China (Shanghai, Chiang KaiShek, the Cultural Revolution, etc.) to recommend this one."
5,Great,"I had purchased the book ""The Publicity Handbook, New Edition: The Inside Scoop from More than 100 Journalists and PR Pros on How to Get Great Publicity Coverage."" It was in great condition and mailed to my home in a nice package. More importantly on time! Very pleased!"
2,Disappointing,"They could've done it a whole lot better.. The highlights included were amazing.. but there's so much more that could've been added to it. Just when I started really enjoying it, it came to an end.The highlights should've been extended a little to include the game play before the highlight itself, to give the viewer an idea of what was going on, and to give a good buildup to the event. It all goes by too fast.Since they bothered releasing a DVD of highlights in the first place might as well make it more than just 20 minutes..."
2,No usb sync!,"I got this dock, thinking that it would be a good alternative to apple's dock. After all, it came with cables and was 30$ less than appple's product. I was dissappointed, however when I lost my usb cable that came with my iPod. When I plugged the dock in using usb, rather than comming up in iTunes all that happened was my ipod started charging. Not a good product. It says clearly in the description that it syncs via usb."
3,That's it?,"Is that all there is? 18 games, an hour long each, an entire season, and they could only come up with 22 minutes of highlights? Somebody got lazy. Granted there are some very memorable moments highlighted on this DVD: Ahman Green's team records, Brett Favre's miraculous game against Oakland after the death of his father, an improbable division title after the Vikings collapse in Arizona, and the overtime playoff victory against Seattle.For the price, this DVD should have been at least an hour long. I would like to see NFL films combine 5 years worth of team season highlights, or maybe 10 years (by era). At 20 minutes each they could put 5 years on one DVD, and the chapters could be created by year. That would be a better value, and take up less space on my shelf."
3,Very good but far too short,"This was a great collection of season highlights from the Packers, but far too short. I watched the whole DVD and thought ""OK, this is just a general overview"", but no, it wasn't. I think Cheeseheads like myself know that there's more than 20 minutes worth of highlights in a Pac season!Maybe they could have compiled it like a soccer DVD, with complete plays shown, including the whole scoring drive, and more focus of replaying the plays that made a difference. You could easily make this into an hour long spectacular, and I hope that's what we get with the 04/05 edition."
5,A real page turner!,"I found Eden's Garden to be a wonderful romance! There is a bit of Peruvian culture mixed in with everyday life of Chicago restaurant owner Jack Talon. Eden Ramirez comes from the Andes, and clashes with the rest of the Chicagoens, but still finds a way to fit in.I found Ms. Rose's characters to be real life, with real problems and accomplishments of their own. Not only Jack and Eden, but the secondary characters as well.This story is well written and will keep your interest. The plot was great, and the humor the author throws in is refreshing. I found myself not wanting to put it down.Pick it up - you'll be happy you did."
4,"A splash of culture, a lot of fun.","With a dash of culture and a lot of class, Peruvian Eden Ramirez turns spoiled rich guy Jack Talon into a likeable character. If you've never read a multi-cultural romance before, this one's a good place to start."
5,The World is Your Oyster... if You Know Where To Look,"I remember the uncertainty of the college search... Being the eldest of three children I did not know where to begin my quest for the perfect college. Frustrated by the lackluster quality of my overworked and underpaid guidance counselor, I sought an answer based upon one of the most prestigious and trustworthy names in the world of college reviews. The Princeton Review has quantitatively and qualitatively laid down the facts and fictions of individual colleges and universities throughout the United States of America. This comprehensive and full-scale review of institutions of learning provides even the most uncertain or apprehensive student with vital information to help facilitate the all-important college selection. I highly recommend this invaluable resource for anyone embarking on the first steps to obtaining the goal of higher education."
4,"Not ""Complete"" but still useful","As college guides go, this one is probably the best. It offers descriptions of a wide range of schools, from community colleges to Ivy League. In almost all cases, there's useful information about size, demographics, admissions requirements and lots more, as well as web addresses for further research. Some school descriptions are missing key information, and might have been better off being replaced by others for whom more data was available. A good first step in the process of deciding where to apply."
2,"Good, Not Great",This book gave a lot of the information that I needed but it was not very organized. You really have to search for the information that you need.
4,Beginning of the process,"This book is highly recommended for the purpose of college search initiation. The book contains 1500 colleges with preliminary details on each of them. the information covers areas such as admission difficulty, courses offered, class diversity, financial aid, etc. The book also comes with a CD very useful in rapidly creating a brief list of colleges suitable for ur qualities.As a reference for basic information about colleges, this is the first book to use."
1,Inexcusiably Out of Date,"I'm working on a project. I won't say what it is. I bought this book to help me with that project. All was well until I came to the listing for Barat College of DePaul University. ""Barat College"" I thought, ""is that a school within a school or a separate entity?"" So I went to the website given. Website down. Ran a google search. Turns out Barat College of DePaul University CLOSED in 2005.How the Heck can this book claim to be ""up to date""?"
3,good singers,"I like this group as far as their zeal and ability to sing. some of their music is a little bit too ""jazzy"" for me though."
5,Africa info,"The Bradt Safari Guide of Botswana is an excellent easy to read book on Botswana. It gives an up to date review of what to bring, what to wear and what to see. In addition there are reviews of hotels,camping grounds and even rental cars. Also the maps are excellent. The traveller will find the guide extremely useful. Ibought mine at Amazon and got a great price"
3,This book was incomplete,"This travel book of Botswana does not cover all of the wildlife viewing areas of the country. We will be traveling to the Tuli reserve on the Eastern edge and wanted to see some information on the private parks in that area as well as the lodges. The book didn't cover any of that, which was pretty disappointing."
2,Duh!,"I almost feel dumber for having read this book. I'm not saying that the author doesn't make some very valid points, he certainly does, but those points are common knowledge for those involved in sales. For every valid point he makes there is at least one ridiculous suggestion... Like this one: Stake out a prospect's business early in the morning or late evening to find out what kind of car he drives so you can stick a note on it asking him to call you??? Can you imagine what would become of your reputation if you got caught playing detective? Can we say ""ethics""? The book is full of sneaky examples such as that one, so if that's what you're looking for, buy this book. If, however, you desire to become a professional and well regarded salesperson, you should probably skip this title.Another gripe: $15 for 72 pages? That seems a little steep to me. I'm not complaining, I should have noticed that before I bought it, but you might find $.50 per sheet of paper to be a little extravagant."
5,Worked for me!,"This is a very good book. The principle behind the counting game was very clear to me, expect objections & be prepared to overcome them. From one review on here, it is clear that someone did not understand the authors thinking. I admit to only reading a couple of books on selling, though iv'e been in sales for almost 40 years and i love what i do. This book gets top marks from me, no blurb, just good ideas that i have tried with good success rates. For the price of a few coffee's, this was value for money."
3,sleazy sales tatics,not a very informative book. he provides some general sales tactics at times real sleazy like suggesting to put your foot on the door so the person doesn't have an opportunity to close the door on you. you would probably learn more as you go than reading this book.
