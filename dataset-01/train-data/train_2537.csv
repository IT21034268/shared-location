1,"Boo - a really, really lame movie","This movie is weak at best. Weak acting, no plot and definately too long. Any decent review is from an individual associated with the film."
1,Bad,The disc only worked for a few minutes before it blacked out and I wasn't able to play it anymore. I had to restart my system and wasn't even worth the effort of trying to play it. Disc quality was horrible.
4,Grandson's Birthday Gift,This item was purchased as a gift for our grandson's 8th birthday. This was one of three Skylanders he had requested and was a big hit when he opened the package.
3,Poekman Battle Revolution,I bought this for my grandson. When he comes to visit we would rent it from the video rental shop. There were directions with the box when rented so we had to just play by quess. He now has his own and totally loves the game. I'm just his cheering squad.
2,Not worth your time or money,"This game is basically an excuse for you to see your Pokemon fight in 3D. That's all you can do. There are no mini-games like in the Pokemon Stadium games, and there CERTAINLY isn't any story mode for you to play, like Pokemon Colosseum and XD for the Gamecube. Just battling Pokemon on the big screen. It just gets repetitive after a while, and for the lack of features in this game, it's just not worth the price. Maybe if the game was [...], but not for its current price.Oh, and if you don't have a Pokemon game for the DS(Diamond, Peral, Platinum), then you're pretty much screwed."
4,pokemon battle revolution,i got this games today and here is what i think...pros:poketopia awesomegraphics greatcool characters and places to battlecons:more strategy than actiontrainers not really customizable at firstbattles sometimes annoyingtakes far too long getting to finals in coluseum mode
1,No use of Wii motion controls in battle,"My boys bought this thinking they could load their DS Pokemon into the Wii and then have a dynamic battle using the Wii controlers. That is not the case; the battles are the same turn-based move selection as the DS Pokeman games. We added the Wii to our collection of gaming platforms for the motion control, so this purchase was a big let down."
1,Poor start for pokemon on the wii,"I give this one star--less if I could. My 8 year old loves pokemon and never even plays this game. The kids couldn't even figure out how to battle against each other (with my 6 year old) until I had to borrow a diamond and pearl from their grandmother to load on to the wii. To make it even worse, one of their friends brought over his ds and we found that you could only download the pokemon from one ds at a time--his remained stuck on his machine unable to be played with unless we erased all the ones we had previously downloaded. Tell me that makes sense. A horrible waste of $40. Don't do it even if you like pokemon!! You or someone you love will be disappointed!! Shame on Nintendo for putting this out!!"
2,Technical flaws kill CD version.,"CD format apparently taken off sound of videoed concert as afterthought. Digitalis extremis, orchestra distant yet treble in your face, instruments in odd places. (Example: Titanic theme with single penny whistle in both center and left twice as loud as all other musicians.) No sound engineer or inner notes provided and I can hear why. Also the audience noise is excessive and annoying, could have been edited out in 1 pass of tape, inexplicable laughter/odd sounds/audible wrong notes mar what must have been a great performance in venue if attended. Cannot fix with several processors. To the Salvation Army donation bin; there are other compilations of his work that sound exceptional on many of the same tracks. If this were my introduction to the artist I would never bother listening to more."
5,Live audience is great.,This has to be one of Andre's best. The live audience adds much to the music being played. I wish I had been there for the performance.
4,who did what?!,"I share the dismay of the reviewer who had no credits on her CD bought in Canada. I bought mine through Amazon and have the same problem. I would eat a bug to find out who sang O Mio Babbino Caro...? Otherwise, an excellent CD!"
2,Too much clapping,"Enjoyed the concert on PBS so would probably enjoy the DVD more than the CD, the clapping just goes on and on and I find it rather annoying. Loved the music."
1,Worst recording in my collection,After watching the video on PBS I rushed to buy this CD. It sounds like an amateur sat in the back row and recorded this. And whats with the dubbed clapping. Surround sound? Strange effects. Sounds better in stereo. This CD does no service to Rieu or the wonderful composers that wrote the music.
1,Credits missing in the packaging for this CD in Canada,Purchasers and researchers of Andre Rieu matters beadvised that the package insert for this CD does notcontain credits as to who performed on this CD. Onlya few pictures are provided.Any CD without this essential information will alwaysget a zero rating from this reviewer. One star is thelowest rating this system permits. The CD deserves azero rating due to missing credits.
5,Best short story ever?,"I have never read a short story that's any better than ""The Films of Richard Egan"".It's a knockout!"
4,Robin Williams on the big screen!,"Would you believe this is the very first motion picture appearance of Robin Williams? Every bit as funny (& naughty) as I remember from the first time I watched it when the only medium was a top loading VTR, and a wired remote!"
2,Was really funny when I was 17 !,"I remembered this movie as being really funny when I first saw it in the seventies, as a teenager . BUT it did not hold up well at all !"
3,You know what you get,"This is done as a series of short scenes & some are a riot, some are lame, some are videos of well known jokes & a couple border on blasphemy but are funny none the less. Put it on for a few laughs on a slow night. Moves from giggle to bored to belly laugh with only a small slow section. A solid 3 stars."
2,"Short on technique, long on tunes","Gary Smith sure can play, but this will disappoint as a instructional video. The quality of the video is so poor it looks like a screen capture. That's neither here nor there where content is concerned, but come on, it's a $22 DVD. Interesting stuff about mics and harps but nothing you can't get in better detail online. ""Demystified"" is a promise too far. You can find it on Netflix. Try it there before you buy it. Lots of varied tunes to play along with - about half of the hour-long DVD. Maybe this is all there is to say about amplified blues harp. If that's what you're after, get it."
1,Worthless; stay away!,"This is the worst consumer product I have bought in quite some time. I was attracted by the fact that it does not have a compressor, was advertised as being silent, and would never need defrosting. All of this is true, although it has buzzed from time to time. Unfortunately, it does not keep foods and beverages cold, nor even ""cool."" My office is rather warm (70 degrees), and this refrigerator never goes below approximately 50 degrees. (I tested with a meat thermometer.)Truly, a piece of junk."
1,Lasts less than 1 year,"The refrigerator worked well for about 6 months, then started making clanking noises. I unplugged it for a few days, and when I plugged it back in, the noise was gone. I went through this routine for about a month, then suddenly, the noise stopped. In the 9th month of ownership, the unit stopped cooling. I called Avanti, as there are no service centers near me and was told that once the unit stops cooling, it cannot be repaired. A replacement could be sent if I sent them the original receipt."
2,"Made some noise that went away, lasted less than 2 years","I bought one for my office because it was inexpensive and only consumed about 60-70 watts of power. Traditional compressor-based refrigerators would use much more and cause greater concern for excessive current draw.After several months of operation, the internal fan was making some noise that sounded like it was grinding against something inside the unit. It was probably frost build up because I unplugged the unit for several hours and then plugged it back in and the noise went away.Just recently the unit stopped cooling suddenly, and the internal light no longer works. It's out of the one-year warranty and the manufacturer said that it cannot be repaired. I guess it is junk now and is going to metal recycling."
2,Snooze,"I bought this book for a graduate course. It has a lot of great information in it, but it's sooooooooo boring."
2,Boring is too kind a word,"My second graduate degree and this by far is the worse textbook I have encountered. Not a single illustration throughout the 530+ pages. The few illustrative ""figures"" were nothing more than columnar charts with little or no explanatory notes. One ""figure"" featured text from a code of ethics that went on for 7 pages! Needless to say, these ""figures"" offered no respite from the monotony. For the budding MLS practictioner, be prepared for long, tedious passages and chapters that average 50+ pages. (One chapter was 75 pages.) While the author clearly intended to provide a comprehensive text, it should not have been at the expense of the reader."
1,Better than a Sleeping Pill,"In all of my years of academic reading, I have never come across a book that presents material in a less inspired way. Torture."
4,Good Information,"This is a good book to have for a reference guide, but a few of the most difficult concepts covered were not explained clearly. All in all, the book is very thourough."
1,Foundations of Library and Information Science,"Very , very unhappy with this book and the seller. The book reeks of cigarette smell, it is impossible for me to hold the book in my hands for more then 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Would never buy anything from this seller."
2,Good cure for insomnia.,"In the immortal words of Alec Baldwin in Beetlejuice, this book reads like stereo instructions. I have not yet picked it up to read it without falling asleep. Be warned if you get this title in a library science course. I actually had to track it down. It is one of the most boring, tedious texts I have ever tried to read. Even the graphics are dull and unimaginative. Textbooks don't have to be so stupifyingly boring as this. The book is very thorough, but you really have to work to stay with it. Run away, run away!!"
3,Commendable but DULL big time,"Rubin offers a competent and well prepared text that covers the field thoroughly. The book, however, is written in a manner that takes all of the interest, colour, and excitement out of librarianship. It is dull and it is boring big time, and it tends to put off those interested in becoming librarians. I know because I'm using it now in a course that I'm teaching. There is really no reason for this for producing such a flat, unappealing volume. I strongly urge Rubin to take on a co-author who would be able to put some life and human interest in this otherwise commendable work. He owes it to his profession."
4,Required Reading...,This is my first book for my Master's of Library and Information Science degree. I already work in the public library which makes this book a little easier to understand. It can be a little dry but I have found that it is readable and informative.
4,"Well, it could be worse...","Compared to Arlene G Taylor's writings on library science, Richard Rubin is positively scintillating. I find this book very manageable in comparison."
4,Text for Library Science,"This book was used as the text for a class in library science. It is a very good introduction to the subject and very readable. Anyone interested in studying information or library science might want to check this out to get an overview. It deals with current issues, but it is a foundational text, so the discussions on marketing and Web 2.0 are just mentioned."
1,Garbage,Although this phone had the features I THOUGHT I wanted (4 mailboxes each having the ability to receord their own outgoing messages) the static and the lack of clarity in the recording makes it worthless.
5,A wonderful record of folk music,Received my cd and have listened to it several times already. It has some soulful old-time songs and great acoustic music. A real treasure for my library of favorite folk variety.
4,Interesting and haunting,"I enjoyed this movie. It may help that I live in Seattle where it was filmed. It's a dark and beautifully filmed love story of sorts. It's a love story told to the backdrop of ACTUAL police incidents. The writer of the film writes a column called ""Police Beat"" in the weekly publication ""The Stranger"" hear in Seattle. This is not a action or fast paced movie. It is more poetic in nature. Enjoy."
4,A fun follow-up to the Fall,"The Fall of the House of Usher was one of several Poe short stories our local book club reviewed last month. In doing research on Poe and the story itself, this is one of the books found to be related to the original story. It has a very interesting twist, the most obvious one is having Poe as a character within the story. Yes, I had my doubts at first, also, but it works! If you liked Anne Rice's Witching Hour series, you should also enjoy Madeline. The storyline is similiar as far as having a ""family involvement"" is concerned. If you read Poe's Fall of Usher, I'm sure you have some questions you would like to ask Poe. Well, Madeline helps with these loose ends."
4,different twist to Poe,"Since I am a Poe fan I thought this book would be good; my, was I surprised. This is one book to read about an event that could have happened before Poe's death and is excitingly eerie. Good read for a long, cold night!"
2,Huh? [2.5 Stars],"Bird's Eye View is more accompanied spoken word than it is hip hop. From the onset, you get the impression that MC Blackbird marches to the beat of his own drummer. He covers a multitude of topics, but drifts into the world of the completely nonsensical more often than not. There are tracks where Blackbird isn't even rapping instead he decides to sing, talk, or in some cases, grunt (yes, grunt) into the microphone. The production duties are handled exclusively by Paris Zax and his work has range. From the melancholy strings to the funky boom bap of old, Zax shows how diverse and well rounded his sound is. If nothing else, Bird's Eye View definitely oozes originality. The jury is still out on whether that's a good thing or not."
1,"This is pure porn, not about motorcycles!","This is not a bike week video, it is a graphic porn video starring black people. I am very disappointed at the false advertising and marketing on Amazon.com of this video. Buyers of porn know where to look for it. Motorcycle enthusiasts should not be misled."
5,Wouldn't trade it for another,"I am a 19 year old college student and this Bible is excellent for teenagers and college students alike. If you like to take notes in your Bible like I do, you will love this Bible! It provides plenty of margin room for note-takers. Also in the margins are questions that stir up the mind, but they aren't enough to get in the way if you don't like to use them. Every once in awhile I will refer to these questions but most of the time I write over them. At the bottom of each margin is a key verse which is good for a spice of inspiration throughout the day. Another helpful key is the biographies of the Biblical characters at each mention of his/her name. They are very interesting and stimulating!This is a perfect Bible to take to church, Bible studies, or homegroups. It is also a good bedtime/morningtime/quiet time Bible."
1,For us it wouldn't shut off.,"We got this as a gift, and had a completely different problem that the other reports. Our torch wouldn't turn off! Following the instructions for turning it off didn't have much of an effect. The flame kept on burning for at least 30 seconds or so. It would eventually go out, but there was still the hissing sound of escaping gas, so we didn't want to leave it just sitting in the kitchen. The igniter would then cause spurts of flame to appear. I finally decided to leave it outside the house so that the butane wouldn't accumulate indoors. Unfortunately, it seems to have quite a gas capacity."
2,Not as jood as it could be!,"This book was a let down. There is a severe lack of character development, and the character interaction is too bland. Mr. Hardy has spoiled us with the previous three books in the series but this book seems to have been written hastily."
3,Lazy James,I looked forward to reading this book because I so enjoyed the other three books but this book was not nearly as good as the first three. I don't know why James wrote this book it was a counterpoint to this otherwise brilliant success. I hope that Mr. Hardy just had a bad day I hope this is not the kind of work he plans to continue to produce if it is he has lost a fan.
1,The Day Easy-E Died,"Thought this book was going to be about Easy-E, not gay relationships. I purchased this book for my son to use for a book report and he was not able to use it."
2,Didn't like this,Too oily didn't seem to do anything to help wrinkles. I like the roc product better I see results with it. This product was a waste
1,previous review,"Well, I'm not sure what happened to my previous review concerning my opinion of this book. I can only guess that the folks at G.A. Sullivan cried loud enough to get it removed. However, I continue to stand by my assessment that this books SMELLS, and not like roses.From the title, I was expecting a book that covered design and implementation methods in depth. However, I was left with a feeling that the book was written more to pat themselves on the back."
3,Recommend you to buy it if ...,"I like SAMS books but for this book I'm annoyed with below:- Installation problem in SQL2000 on XP workstation. I needed to install database in another server.- The flowcharts seem to be output of ""overnight"" crash or the company G.A.S has been relectant to disclose details. We want full UML diagrams.- The sample project is too casual although the posters on wall seems serious.- Adopt ms passport in authoring ticket purchasing. We want VeriSign component.However, I still recommend you to buy it if you just want paper reference of a ticket purchasing counter and some loosely organized white papers but relevant to the topic, .net + architecture.Last. To G.A.S.Wish you bright future in sales of the book and your business. Please strengthen the post-sales support on web."
3,Many good ideas but have some critical errors,I'm not knocking this book down. Book is good but you must know about errors and book must have bugtraq.
4,Much more that a list of coding standards,"You know it's a book for geeks if there are 101 tips but the numbering starts at zero. That said, this book is outstanding. It was everything I had hoped the new edition of Meyers's ""Effective C++"". In particular, if you learned C++ a while ago but need to get up to speed with the latest developments in RAII, templates, etc., then I can't imagine a better book.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that now and then the language is just too clunky. In particular, I had to read ""...the name lookup for that operator function might reach out into the name space...Whether it reaches out into N..."" a few times before I understood that ""reaching out into"" is meant to be a synonym for ""reach into"".On the whole, however, the book is quite readable, and the code examples hit the sweet spot of demonstrating the topic of discussion without being overly long."
3,It is just a brief repeating of other books from the same Author,"If you own the 3 ""Exception C++"" books, do not buy this book. It is just a mirror copy of those. And the explanation in this book is brief. Typically, if you are familiar with the content of this book, it works as a quick reference manual or pocket book."
5,Great book of principles,"Contains a vast number of very important advice.Assuming you've already got Stroustrup's ""The C++ Programming Language"", you should buy this for the principles, buy Matthew Wilson's ""Imperfect C++"" for the practice, and buy Steven Dewhurst's ""C++ Common Knowledge"" for the advanced terminology.You won't need anything else."
3,"not bad, but very disappointed","This book is for newbies. If you read a lot about c++ effective, c++ whatever series, this is not the book for you. It's not because the materials are easy, they've just been mentioned and referenced by books and internet for so LONG.I personally think the word ""Standards"" in the title is just misleading and WRONG!!. That's also the reason I had high expectation from this book, but obviously made me very upset after reading it. I guess it was still my fault, because the book is obviously not organized systematically as indicated by the title.So Read the book title three more times before you decide if it's the right book for u."
5,Bookmarks sticking out all over,"This book sits proudly on my desktop among other important tomes by Meyers, Coplien, and Alexandrescu. The number of bookmarks sticking out the top of it speaks to its importance in my C++ reference arsenal. If you don't have this book, and you are a serious C++ developer, you need it."
5,Great learning information!!!,I have been around the dental field for a while and this book shows so much more than I had expected. It is detailed in so many ways with great pictures to show you what it really looks like in life.A great sell and attribute for the dental field!!!
3,"Looks nice, but...",This tank looks great. We purchased one of the 1.77 gal tanks for our son along with a male Beta. The only problem with it is that the filter is too strong for the size of the tank. When we placed the fish in the tank he freaked out and couldn't stop swimming around because the current was too strong. We had to pull the filter out and now we have to change out the water once a week. It's more work than we wanted for ourselves and our 6 1/2 year old son.
1,Never Seen Anything Like This Before,"Finally someone scours existing literature, gets permission to reprint some similar articles, and publishes them all in a book. Imagine the hours and hours spent entering search phrases. And here is the result of all that work. Zounds consort!Isolate your noisy stuff from your quiet stuff with whatever trenches or diffusions you can find in the crummy ... process you are stuck using, work on your various rejection ratios, pray for luck, hope your stock options become worth something someday, and spend the price of this book on beer and doughnuts."
3,not great,"This dictionary is a little old by now. It is actually two separate books and the Tamil-English volume is considerably smaller than the English-Tamil. The range of vocabulary is also rather limited and necessarily restricted to words current a century ago. It'll do in a pinch, but I can't believe there's nothing better available. I'd advise shopping around a little more than I did before settling for this one."
2,Interesting,"Uncle Albert won't stay in his coffin. What a way to start a book. There are flashes of a really good tale, but as a fan of this kind of story and this publishing company I was expecting better.The characters are good and have potential, but it just lacks a little something.I'd read another one by the author if it goes into more detail. It's Missouri and vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and the walking dead are supposedly commonplace. I'd like an explanation of that since I don't think that's so commonplace in Missouri.It's billed as ""tongue in cheek horror"" and I guess I was expecting more suspense and enjoyment.Also, I've come to enjoy a brief biography of the author. That would have been nice to see here."
2,Interesting stories and little accuracy,If you like talking to a drunk guy who tells stories in a half accurate way then this is the book for you. I read this book twice. Once when I first bought it and later when I saw it in my book shelf. Both times I was struck by the unusual amount of detail and the constant inaccuracies. I resold the book and wished that the author had done better. What a waste of money and very frustrating. If you don't know much about special ops then you won't be disappointed. In this case ignorance is bliss.
1,Twilight Writing,Arostegui does the entire SOF community a disservice with this grossly inaccurate book. It should be sold as fiction.
1,Poor customer service!!,"I purchased the download version from Roxio online. I was able to install it but I don't have the serial number to make it work. They did send me the email with the serial number but where the serial number is suppose to be located is ""blank"". I have sent two emails to support about this matter in two days and have not yet gotten a reply.Plus the other thing I don't like about this program is that you can only send ringtones to only one phone. If you have two phones you need to purchase two serial numbers. You cannot choose other phones from the option menu. You need to buy them! They omit to tell you that in their ""features""!"
1,A deceptive product,"""It works on most cellular phones"". That's a way to hide another phrase: ""I doesn't work on all the cellular phones"". In fact it's a hoax. It only works on a very limited number of cell phone makes and ABOVE ALL it is geographically limited. It only works in a very small number of countries. I removed the software in less than 5 minutes after installation."
2,disappointed,After reading several reviews I was expecting soo much more. I have not been able to get this to work and it costs money for you to connect to the internet from your phone to download the selection if and when you can. Should of stayed with my phones service provider for ringtones...
4,Fun Program,"I was able to load all 6 ringtones I created so far. I have a Motorolla phone and the only problem I had was if I try and manually enter the website to download my ringtone, it doesn't work. If I let my phone go to the website by choosing ""link to site"" it downloads perfectly! I am happy with the program and am thinking of getting another for my son. You do need to be able to download from a website with your phone for the program to work."
2,not compatible,"Be cautious with which phone you are purchasing this software for....it's not compatible with Verizon's phones, specifically LG 6000 series. They are accepting a full refund for return."
1,"If I could, I would not touch it with a ten-foot pole","1) Software crashes often2) Errors when trying to download to my phone (sony ericsson z500a on Cingular, both ""supported"" by this software)3) the only way to download ringtones is through browser on phone. This costs money depending on plan with the cellular service provider. (Meaning? Ringtones cannot be downloaded to phone from a laptop through infrared/bluetooth even if both phone/computer supported these communication methods. Yes, very dumb.)I have uninstalled the software and destroyed the CD by jumping on it with my tap dance shoes on. I feel a little better now."
1,Program cannot be OPENED!!!,"This software sucks. After I installed it, and I tried to open it a thousand times... Nothing happened. Then I uninstalled and re-installed this thing, nothing changed. I still cannot open the program. Don't even know how this program looks like. Slow down my computer. This is a must return software. Money Back!!!"
5,Top Shelf,"Why did they wait so long to put this out? Great find and well worth the price. In fact, it's a steal."
4,Rory's Raw Roots,"A must-have for any Rory Gallagher collection. The only thing that keeps me from rating it 5 stars is the annoying and obtrusive keyboard player. I've always felt this was the case in all of Rory's recordings. Nevertheless, it was fantastic to have something new from the most under-appreciated artist in rock. We really miss you Mr. Gallagher."
4,"Yoko becomes more ""Queenly""; Sugimoto also changes.","The first arc is wrapped up in this volume. Yoko confronts Sugimoto for the last time. At the end of this DVD, one girl gains a kingdom in ruins, and the other the ruins of a self-delusion. Both do a lot of growing up (about time!), and both become more likeable characters in the process--particularly Sugimoto. Sugimoto ends the arc on a tantalizing cliff-hanger which provides a nice entry into the second arc.One thing: ep. 11-12 don't really involve Yoko. These two eps. tell the story of how a quick-witted 16th century Japanese pirate ""King"" was chosen to be the Emperor of En. Very good couple of episodes actually.BTW, fans of Rakushun (that adorable rat-boy) can look forward to some sweet moments strewn throughtout these eps., in which he lends Yoko his political support, as well as his particular blend of practical wisdom."
4,"Still Great, but Not As Great As Previous Volumes","Dont get me wrong, I love the show, however, this volume, while being good, is not quite as good as the first two volumes. One episode is the reasoning behind my giving this volume four stars. One episode of the disc serves not only as a filler, which is common for many anime dvds, but as a series recap. Not even 20 episodes into the series and already a series recap. My personal opinion is that a series recap should not be done unless a minimum of 50 episodes have been produced beforehand. Not only did I find it quite annoying that such an episode had already made it's way into the series, but also found this episode to be incredibly boring. The episode at times seemed rushed, while at others dragged on and on in a seemingly never ending borefest for the ages. For a recap episode and thats saying allot considering recaps are meant to fill an individual in on the prior occurances of the series."
3,Good Jeans but High Waisted,I like the quality of these jeans but they are a little higher-waisted than my preference. I will still wear them and get good use. The inseam is a little longer than I am accustomed to also.
5,GREAT JEANS,GREAT JEANS FIT GREAT AND I AM A BIG MAN AND I LOVE THESE FOR MY WEAR WILL BUY MANY MORE IF THET ARE NOT CHANGED
5,"Tough, Warm, Great fit","These are some great jeans the back pockets are lined with the same kind of material as Carheart duck jackets so your wallet, skull, or magazines won't wear out as easily as others. The front pockets are well made as well twice as thick as other brands, Levies, regular Wranglers. I got these in a 52x30 because I carry in concealment inside my waist band and they fit great. So the fit is right both in width and in length. For the price I don't think you can find a better pair of jeans,"
5,For working men,"These are the kind of jeans that a working man wants. I am so tired of the thin material that lasts for just a few months. This material is THICK, it does no wear out, the belt loops are wide and thick and do not pull out. If you are looking for dress jeans, maybe these aren't for you. If you are sick of thin, cheap material that is poorly put together, and need a work jean that will really last, then these are what you want."
5,Jeans that fit,"Bought for husband w/out any prior knowledge of this brand. He is pleased and that's hard for him. He is a large man and I have a hard time finding jeans to fit him. I do wish they came in 28 length though. The price was more than reasonable. I received them a few days before I thought they'd arrive and that was nice, too."
1,Have not received,"I placed a order for two pairs of pants and have received only one of them.The pair that i did get is of good quality and fit well.I would give a good rating on the product it self , but not on the experiense."
5,Great fitting jeans,"Great fitting jeans at a good price. Most big men's jeans are much more expensive, these are durable and well constructed."
5,review of Camelot,Excellent film...the music will run in your head for days and days on end. Beautifully filmed as well...you'll want to watch more than once.
5,Sweet Silly,"This is a sweet and silly story. It is also outrageous and funny. In addition there is some lovely music at the end. If you are looking for a movie that will leave you with a smile, then this will suit."
5,A Very Special Film Experience,A wrongly Broken and Humiliated Conductor sets out to find his rapture and in process provides us with uproarious laughter and profound emotions and excitement when it all comes together and a secret is revealed.
2,The Concert,loved the movie in its original version in russian/french with subtitles.hated the dubbed version. it's not the same movie...it does not capturethe emotions and the words of the actors.
5,Hilarious yet inspiring movie that is worth paying to watch,"I saw this movie in a flight from US to Japan. I saw it once and fell in love with this movie. I actually ordered a copy of its DVD recently and watched it 3 times already. I will watch it again. I rarely purchase DVDs considering that I can rent it for a couple of dollars. This one is worth paying the original price. It's a hilarious comedy and at the same time such an inspiring movie. You can tell those who made this movie really love music, especially that of Tchaikovsky. I do love music of Tchaikovsky myself."
2,THOUGHT I'd like it!,A new acquaintance described the music - I thought WOW just my style...NOT! While not wholly enjoyable it may do for some special occasion that I've yet to determine.
4,nice little fryer,"For a single person this is a good buy. Cooks small amounts well. Just a little messy with the cleanup but since I don't use it often, it's OK."

1,Would you drink Listerine?,"Yesterday I saw a homeless woman taking a swig from a massive bottle of Listerine. She almost gagged from the horrible taste but she was after the alcohol so she didn't care.Well, today I popped a couple of these Eclipse Polar Ice gums in my mouth, and I just about threw up as the taste brought back the sight of the homeless woman drinking Listerine. I can't imagine how anyone would voluntarily wish to swallow that flavour.Vile stuff. Keep away."
3,"Fun Shark Movie, Horrible Voice-over","The shark footage in this movie is pretty badass. The voice-over acting/dubbing is TERRIBLE. If you can skip all the storyline and just watch the shark parts, its fun to watch. This will not hold your attention if you just sit and watch it. I played on the internet until the good parts, trying not to look at the actors mouthes. The dubbing is laugh-out-loud funny/bad at times. I suggest some adult beverages accompany the viewing of this film."
5,way better than screeching weasel,"for some who don't know, The Riverdales is Screeching Weasel minus one, and if Screeching Weasel wasn't Ramones-ish enough, then you need to check out these guys. very awesome punk rock treats here. there are only about 4 songs on the whole cd i listen to, but you should buy this cd for one song only, and that's ""Back To You"".........that song is frickin' awesome. get this."
3,ramones it ain't,"i guess covering an entire ramones LP with screeching weasel was not enough homage for ben to do, so he sheds jughead, reuniting with vapid and panic, to form this ""new"" band. i appreciate the liza & louise reference in ""fun tonight,"" but i'm sorry, i didn't feel like i had as much fun listening to it as they did recording it."
1,DO NOT PAY OUTRAGEOUS PRICES!,"While this album is out of print currently, it is to be reissued by Asian Man Records on Oct 10, 2006. People are selling this CD for as much as $50 when it will be available brand new and remastered for $8 if you wait until October..."
4,Acne Fighter,This oil really helps my daughter keep her acne in control. She just puts a little directly on the troubled areas and by the next morning they are definately clearer. I gave it 4 out of 5 because it does have a strong scent.

5,A real Review from a genuine otaku,"This is the ninth book for Kodocha and I was very amazed at the great story. If you like romantic comedy, then this is the book for you. This book is about Sana Kurata, who is a child actress and her kind-of daily life. I know it sounds boring, but after I read the first book, I knew that this was going to be a good series. Trust me on this one, I've read over ten different series of books, and this is a very good one to read. IF you're an otaku(anime/manga fanatic) then you'll like this. If your one of those people that like violence and a story with no basic plot, then this simple story of love, heartfelt, and funny series will not interest you. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good manga."
1,I Have Nothing to Do with This Book,For some reason my name keeps getting associated with this ridiculous volume. I want to assure folks out there that I have nothing whatsoever to do with this book.Kenneth Currie
3,A disappointing book from a very good mystery writer,"I've read all of Sue Henry's books and enjoyed them all, as I did ""Deadfall,"" but I found this to be the least stimulating and creative of her five novels.Her sense of place is superb, as always, but the plot here, while still engaging, is also predictable and routine. I also think that the author is struggling a bit with what to do with the relationship between Alex and Jessie; their interactions are beginning to sound like an Alaskan version of Robert Parker's Spenser and Susan.This is still worth a read, but I wish I'd waited for the paperback."
2,"Good premise, poor delivery","DEADFALL was my first exposure to Sue Henry's writings, and probably my last, as well. The plot was well conceived and the location interesting, but the execution left a lot to be desired. The author makes many glaring errors, and the heroine is rather foolishly displayed. Her moronic actions in confrontations with the killer were so frustrating that I kept screaming out loud, ""Just shoot him, you idiot! Geez, how stupid are you?"". Ms. Henry would do well to hire a ghostwriter to rewrite this piece. Then perhaps a worthwhile mystery would emerge. For a true master of the mystery genre, try Tony Hillerman's Navajo Mysteries. The audio tapes and CDs from Recorded Books are priceless; pass on the Books On Tape offerings."
4,Great Read!,"This is my first book that I have read of Sue Henry's. The writing is good, plotting is superb. I will continue to read her books. This book is the first one in a long time that actually got me invovled with the characters. Although this book is not perfect, the writing and story is good enough to always keep you turning the page."
3,What happened?,"I am a great fan of Sue Henry and could't wait to read her 5th book. All her other books kept getting better and better. This one just does not have the mystery and smooth writing of her other books. In fact, I found this one rather boring and felt Ms. Henry was reaching for something that was not there. I can only hope her next book gets back into the beautiful discription of Alaska and has a better believable mystery."
4,Great Mystery,"I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers here. I thought this was a very well plotted story. The action was reminiscent of Murder On The Iditarod Trail which I thought was exceptional. Even the everyday chores Jesse performs are made interesting. I'm glad that the relationship between Jesse and Alex is continuing unchanged. If they were to marry, I think a lot of the spark would be lost. The only trouble with Ms. Henry's books is that they are finished too soon."
2,"Good plot, Poor writing","I found the Alaskan scenery and way of life to be very interesting, however, as a mystery this book didn't cut it. Jessie was about as dumb as any main character I have ever read about. She carried a 44, was supposedly competent with firearms, never took a shot at a stalker who was shooting at her, and eventually gave her gun up to the stalker while cooking his breakfast. What drivel. Who in their right mind when someone is trying to kill them, would be furious at anyone for sending help because their independence was threatened. The story is inprobable and needed a good proofreading."
2,Deadfall falls flat.,"I have always enjoyed Sue Henry's books, but this one leaves me feeling puzzled. I am one of those people who gets frightened in a movie when somebody pops out of a closet. When Jessie was alone on an isolated island and heard noises -- well, I had to quit reading. I read in the middle of the night, and frankly, I got scared. It took me over a month to get up my courage and read it in the daytime, only to discover there wasn't much to the story. How contrived can a plot get? Her descriptions are wonderful as always, but they won't hold a novel together without a decent plot. I hope our Sue hasn't lost her touch, and can come up with something better than this in the near future. Also, she better make up her mind, or maybe her characters should make up their mind for her, about their relationship in the future. It hurts to have them confused. Wake up, little Susie!"

2,"Solow-growth model, nothing else","I was expecting - hoping - for something a little different. Helpman runs through the Solow growth model and does little else. I ended up putting it down. Nothing about competing theories, why economic growth models work some places and not in others, or anything beyond the mainstream model. If that's what you're looking for, that's great, but otherwise, take a look at The Elusive Quest for Growth by Bill Easterly, or The Mystery of Capital, by Hernando de Soto. Those offer a departure from the norm of development theory."
2,Still a mistery...,"Helpman, his name notwithstanding, doesn't help much in understanding ""the mystery"". Maybe the title is far too ambitious, maybe it's because of his often convoluted writing, maybe because the most important recent evolutions in growth theory seem not to have been thoroughly digested by the author, maybe because there's little about the politics of economic growth. In fact, the part on governance and institutions in particular is less than clear. The first chapters are better, though: clear and comprehensive. But that is not enough to make of this book a classic."
2,For Graduate Student in Economics Only,"This volume may be appropriate and understandable by those who have extensive backgrounds and training in economics, but is rather tough going for those who have taken only micro and macro economics courses."
4,Very good reading for the mind.,"This book was well written,dealing with his own fellings of himself and his family.It seems to me that Dr.Belzunce needed to deal with the grief and the self healing in full circle.Which was accomplished.The loss of both parents as my wife and I have just been thru is a time I wish for no one to experience.The reading of this book helped out in a positive manner."
5,Excellent!,This book covers all the desired aspects of entomopathogenic bacteria. Each chapter is quite easy to follow. Best of the best!
1,Disk crash,"The product worked well for 4 months. Reasonably fast, quiet, and a good price. Then the disk crashed, unable to access any data on the drive. I had previously read of several people having problems with this drive, I should have taken heed. Can't send it back as it stored backup finance data and given that the drive does not function, I am unable to wipe the data clean."
3,Western Digital 320 GB HD,"Wester Digital 320 GB HD came with copying software. Not able to understand the installation process I called Western Digital support. The support was satisfactory and free. It took hours to copy an almost full 80GB HD. I was impressed with a much faster bootup and program response time. But two out of thirty programs stopped functioning. 1. I could not get online, which I'm sure could have been resolved and 2. My DVD coping program did not work. Western Digital tech support was contacted and I was told to reinstall it again. This took more than 24 hours and yielded the same results. Hence I use this drive as a slave for storage. For the money and the three-year warranty you can't go wrong."
4,replace HD,"I was replacing a HD for a neighbor, a six year old Gateway. The new Hd didn't exactly fit into the Gateway as the old one was in a slot and held there by moving a lever to tighten into place. The new one was not the same size as was indicated in the ad there fore I had to do a little modification on the box to get it to stay in place.Mechanically wise the Western Digital WD3000JBRTL Caviar 320 GB worked just fine plugged it in and we were off to the races faster than the one I replaced and much quieter. This should allow the user several more years out of the old Gateway which is in the basement and used by his two boys for games and homework."
3,Half Impressed,"Although this works well, I followed the directions while installing it and still came up with the same error. Then after it was installed and I went to format the drive, it had issues accepting the Operating System. I still get a disk read error when I start up and have to go to my bios in order to access my actual account. Otherwise this is quiet, and runs well."
3,Warranty rip-off.,By reputation Western Digital drives are very good BUT this retail packaged drive's warranty is for one year FROM DATE OF MANUFACTURE. There is nothing on the packing to indicate this and I only found out about it when I went to WD's website and entered my drive's serial number to buy an extended warranty. My brand new drive was manufactured 2/05 so I'm out of luck. You might want to look at other brands if the warranty is important to you.
4,An excellent product,"I would have rated this five stars, except that the included data life guard software failed to copy over my old XP boot hard drive successfully. The copy booted, but a lot of the installed software failed to work, or came up as unregistered. Luckily I was able to use a third party backup image utility to copy the old drive on to this drive. I would have been dead in the water if I did not have that utility. Otherwise, no complaints."
5,Western Digital WD3200JBRTL,"Received product sooner than expected. Installation was easy. If I known it was that easy, I would have gotten it sooner. So far, no problems except for the low humming sound from the drive. Worth it."
4,Good Value for A Lot of Bytes,"Not a completely trouble free installation. I did have to run the program to migrate the data from the old drive to this one twice (took 3-4 hours each time). This is the second of these drives I'm putting in my Compaq, replacing the 120 GB hard drive that came with it. The WD is faster and compatible with EIDE in this machine."
1,cable IS NOT included,"The product description says that IDE cable is included and the box and literature included with the drive plainly says it is not. These cables are less than $10 and if you buy this drive you will be in a big hassle getting it straight between the seller and the manufacturer. It wasn't worth ten bucks of my time on the phone, I just got one from a friend. Big PIA."
3,Suitable for the already knowledgeable car person,"Definitely a very in depth guide to repairs on these Ford trucks. However, as an amateur they don't provide as many pictures as i'd have liked to show me what parts and where things connect to."
4,Lots of Information,"Received by Ford Ranger Manual from Amazon in great shape. I'm having trouble with my 4 wheel drive not working in the two front wheels and this book really gave me some good tips to try so hope to have it fixed soon. This book has lots of information in it. This book is a good choice if your're having problems with your Ford Ranger,Ford Exployer or Mountaineer Models 1991 thur 1999."
3,Chilton Ford Repair manual 1991-1999,"This was a very used manual, grease stains etc., but it delivered the information as described and I got the job done. Just goes to show you that it don't have to be pretty to get the job done, and it cost $5.38."
1,Chilton's has lost touch with reality.,"I purchased this book for needed factual, accurate information of which I got neither. I wanted to replace the lower ball joints on my '99 Ranger, so I bought this book. Take note: on page 8-4 it states specifically that the 1998-99 Ranger does NOT have coil springs. This of course is hogwash as my '99 most definitely has coil springs. In addition, it states on page 8-8 that the ball joint is an integral part of the lower control arm. This, too, is complete hogwash. Please be advised that this book is RIFE with erroneous information - including any pictures contained therein. I have lost all faith in Chilton's ability to present the correct information on ANY automobile."
1,Computer Module? This book only lists ONE!,"There are several computer modules on my ford explorer. I bought this book to list them, and guess what, It lists just one. And its detailed instructions on how to access that module was ""remove dash to expose computer module"" and no diagrams. I dont know about you, but behind MY dash is a Buttload of stuff behind my dash, and not only that, but my dash comes apart in sections, so just what section I wonder?Useless! Breaks it covers fairly well, good thing that the explorer, ranger, and mountaineer all use the same breaking system(cough cough)cause it lists just one way.Good thing the electronic diagrams are the same for all the vehicle types(cough cough) for all listed vehicles from 1991 to 1999 as it onlyu lists one vehicle schematic, otherwise Id be lost.Good thing there was a mechanic within calling distance to put back together everything I ripped out per the chiltons book, otherwise Id be walking......."
2,not that great,this book didnt give me any useful information on my vehicle. even though this book is for my vehicle. i wouldnt recommend this to anyone
3,not as good as i had hoped,i was disappointed when i tried to find what i was working on on my old truck . it was a case of haveing to many trucks cramed into the same book . it was easy to read a page or two and then figure out they were talking about a truck that wasn't mine and wasn't the same as mine as far as being repaired . i'm not a mechanic so i was hoping for a book with lots of diagrams specific to my truck .
1,Not true christian or religion,"This book should not be in the religious section, as it is obviously written by a person with no purpose in life. The characters are living in regret and obviously have never read: ""You, LORD, give perfect peace to those who keep their purpose firm and put their trust in you."" Isaiah 26:3 (TEV)This book is a sad depiction of how people live in the past with regrets and should've, would've, could've. Remember the present is the best gift a person can give his or herself. If you are looking for a truly uplifting book read Rick Warren's ""Purpose Driven Life"" of Spencer Johnson's ""The Present"".J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye was more uplifting than this book. I wish the author luck in therapy later in life if this book is chocked full of real life experiences."
4,Good skillet,"This is my primary cooking skillet. I use at least twice daily and it really does the job. The only problem is that the non-stick properties only last about 12-18 months. The pan then gradually loses it's non stick properties until it is no better than a normal skillet. Because of the anodized aluminum, you never have to worry about the coating flaking off. Even though it does not last as long as I'd like, not having Teflon flakes in your food is a good thing."
5,Super even cooking,"Not being happy with the less than even cooking I was getting out of the legacy cast iron skillet salvaged from my mom's place, I went looking for a better pan. This skillet cooks exceptionally evenly due to the heavy footplate. (which you can see better on the photo for -Infinite Circulon 10.5 Inch Covered Buffet CasseroleThat foot plate may be the distinguishing feature of the ""infinite"" line. I only wish that it was a bit bigger or that Circulon made the big two burner griddle with the same foot plate. It is our daily pan...but only for a couple of months so far. I sure hope it lasts longer than the other review says."
4,Pretty Solid,The product is well built and attractive. Seems to heat well and we've had no issues after 30 days of use. I would probably purchase again.
2,Flawed classic,"The Offenbach score is just sheer exuberant magic, that can carry you away. The solo and chorus work is fine but badly let down by poor recording technique - we hear one person in a trio or quartet very well, and the others very faintly, as though they had been sent to the other side of the hall. Could be better."
2,Three Six Is About To Fall Off!!!,If you dont believe that u stupid as hell. They made a song with Justin Timberlake and Bow Wow. Thats evidence enough. Then the beats they been putin out been pure garbage. Everybody they've gotten rid of gonna come back together and throw 3-6 out the window. its inevitable. Crunchy been down since day one though... they didnt have to do it like that.
1,No wonder why Paul &Juice didnt wanna release this,This album is a joke. The reason Paul & Juice didnt do a good job cuz they do this album wasnt good the lyrics are trash
5,On His Own 4 Real,I guess Three 6 figured they had to drop Crunchy's album to make some extra money off the cat since he left the group. They ain't slick though. Usual Three 6 formula. Album is straight 4 sho... bout time. Holla when it's gangsta.
4,BOUT TIME,"I been waitin fo dis mayne to drop fo a minute. But now that is has it got my ride bumpin bio, dat crunchy black what u know bout dat sucka."
5,A book everyone should read if they want to understand immigration,"This is an important book that humanizes the immigration issues we are facing in the U.S. today. Families are being torn apart, risking everything trying to find a way out of desperate poverty. If we want to solve these problems, we need to invest in Latin America, create jobs and support production of goods in these countries. Nazario followed the the struggle of just one of thousands of children who comes to the US to find a parent. It's absolutely heartbreaking, but important to understanding the immigration situation. I went to hear the author speak--she is a dedicated, brave and passionate woman!"
5,Muy buen libro para reflexionar.,"Hace poco adquiri este libro y tengo que ser honesta desde que lo empeze a leer no queria parar, me llama tanto la atencion de todo lo que pasan estas personas con tal de conseguir un sueno.Ojala y este libro lo pudieran leer cada presidente de centroamerica para que se pusieran la mano en la conciencia,pero claro estan demasiado ocupadas en sus campanas politicas.Se los recomiendo para toda la familia muchos de nosotros nos quejamos por las largas esperas en los aeropuertos o por los tramites de aduana eso no es nada comparado a lo que pasan estas personas."
3,"Excellent story, insightful. Can do better with the translation","This true story is an eye opener to the reality of what imigrants face and risk to set foot in the US. Makes us (those who live legally and are born in US) appreciate the opportunities we have. The vivid accounts of the atrocities these poor people go through makes you wonder where the value of human life lies. I recommend you read it in english, as the translation to spanish was not that great."
5,a look at the plight of migrant children,This book highlights the importance parents have for their children and the lengths a child would go to be with their mother. I lived in Honduras for years and will testify that the protagonists life as described is not an exaggeration for any one that might doubt. So many parents leave their homes in hopes of improving their child's life by being able to send money back- when what might be best is to simply stay and be there. It's a difficult and less than obvious choice for a parent that believes lack of money is the biggest obstacle to success. Here is one child's tale.
1,Very boring game with weak educational component.,"This game is very weak in both the educational and fun aspects.Speaking to the spelling component, for the entire game, each player only spells one word, so the max number of words you can learn to spell is the number of players in the game.The honey bee facts are kind of cool, but the annoying part about them is that some of the facts don't make any sense because they depend on other facts that may or may not have been revealed yet.The fun factor is low because there are long boring stretches where nothing happens. Draw a card, move some spaces, do nothing. Your turn. Repeat.The game is pure luck and while that can be fun in some well designed games, this game allows one player to easily get ahead with no chance of the other players catching up, which leads to devastating losses.Finally the game storage is annoying because the two types of cards don't have separate compartments so they have to be resorted every time."
2,Nothing like Buckcherry,"Wow, what a disappointment this CD was. Thank God I could borrow if from someone and didn't waste my own money. Apparently Josh Todd thinks he is somebody in the rock world, breaking up a good, solid band to put out this crap. Heavy, sludgy guitars with no life or joy to them, incomprehensible lyrics and no melody at all. If you want to be bludgeoned, this is your CD. If you want more Buckcherry, avoid this. I gave it 2 stars because there were 1 or 2 decent songs and I've heard a lot worse CDs, but I was expecting so much more."
2,I'll give him credit for still making music... but this reek,"I'm giving this cd 2 stars only becuase I think Josh Todd is an awesome frontman and hes been making music since the late 80s.Though this band is nothing like buckcherry, it sucks.Its just generic modern rock garbagestick with buckcherry, unless you enjoy 1 hit wonders (if you can consider any of these songs a hit)"
2,Bleh,"Fans of Buck Cherry will be dissapointed with this new album. Instead of the sex, drugs and rock and roll theme that BC had going for it hard, ""Josh Todd"" feels like an album soley directed at girls. From the cover art of Josh Todd standing melodramatically looking down at his feet with his back rippling with muscle, it screams ""Pay attention to me! I'm Josh Todd! Women want me!"" The songs only reinforce the theory...they all sound very, very similar, like a train labled ""Buck Cherry"" collided into a train labled ""Don't have much talent"" and the result is a CD not worth buying even for the most hardcore (male) Buckcherry fan. The girls will love it. But if you're a guy, you probably won't be fooled by the hack job of a CD that Josh Todd actually made."
1,Don't buy this just cause you like Buckcherry,"Honestly, I bought this CD at a garage sale for $1.00 and I think I got ripped off. There is only one word to describe it: horrible. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Horrible. I like Buckcherry, but this sounds nothing like them. Josh Todd really disappointed me. Get Buckcherry back together and start making real music again.To sum up this review in one word: HORRIBLE!"
5,6 stars would be more appropriate.,"This is by far, the best 'Rock' album to come out in the last 3 years. This has all the vibe of Guns-N-Roses circa 1987. Josh Todd is a rock star with presence (physical & vocal) for miles. That being said, you throw in a young bunch of modern metal groove masters, and the result is total genius. If you aren't really that fond of Buckcherry, don't let that deter you...you should give this album a chance."
4,Choas is back with Josh Todd,"This cd is pretty well put togther I have to say.If you like Buckcherry, well ,too bad, its a lot heavier then them, and, I like it. (#1 mind infection) Great way to kick of the cd.(#2 broken) kicks you in the face.(#4 flowers and cages) great song. (#5 shine) ok. I like this song but, I think creed did this song. (the guitar work sounds like it.)(#7 blast) Great song. If your going to kick someone ass, play this song. Those are the best songs on the cd. The other ones are good but, not as strong as the ones I listed. Over all great cd. I almost wish that buckcherry didn't get back together again. The Josh Todd band helped Mr.Todd out alot on this cd even though his voice is still strong.Peace."
5,Best CD Ever,"This has been by far the best CD I have ever purchased, If you like Buckcherry you will LOVE this!!!!"
1,useless,"This video is useless for children of all ages. I bought it to expose my kids to various religious traditions. For the younger kids, this video was much too abstract and ""artsy"" to have any meaning. For the older kids, it was too cute and deviod of real insight or information. A total waste."
4,interesting...,"I, myself, enjoyed the movie because I wanted to learn more about world religions. My kids were half and half on it. Because the movie tries to give you a little info on several religions it's pressed for time and some religious information is not introduced. So that left me confused on a couple of stories. Others stories are very thorough. Overall, I think its a good intro for children to grasp main ideas."
2,"Religions of the world; our faiths anim,ated",I bought the video intending to use it as a classroom presentation for our Sunday School. After reviewing the video I determined it to be overly juvenile for our age group(60-80). I passed it too the childrens class teacher hoping she would find it appropriate.
3,Good but disappointing...,"Having read most if not all of Robert Godwin's other fine compendiums on the different manned spaceflights, I was a bit disappointed that this one wasn't up to the same standard. There was considerable coverage of STS-1 (which I would have expected), but the others did not have mission debriefings. And the CD was not as complete nore does it work at all well on a Macintosh because of the windows 8 character file naming issues.In summary, I think it could have been done better... it seemed to be rushed out the door."
1,Lousy Upgrade! Save your money!,"Save your money, stick with CS2! Everything they've 'upgraded' in this version is a downgrade as far as I'm concerned. I work in a production environment using Adobe Illustrator 7+ hours a day and the CS3 upgrade has done nothing but make my job harder. Apparently Adobe is getting input from non-users these days in order to fashion their upgrades. Either that, or they needed to justify an upgrade (to a perfectly fine version) in order to generate revenue.At any rate, if you're on CS2--Stay there!"
1,Cheaply made......Horrible Transfer to DVD (Unwatchable),"I bought this exact same DVD, with the same cover, in the Store. Right out of the box, I tried to watch ""The Strangler,"" with Victor Buono. I did say ""tried."" There was NO sound. A bit of low keyed something which I guess was supposed to be the soundtrack. But it didn't transfer onto this DVD. It's a shame because I saw this movie before and enjoyed it.I took it back to the store for a refund."
1,""" I"" Strain",The print is too small. I used a magnifier with my regular glasses and it was not worth the trouble. A complete waste of money.
1,scrabble word finder,It was not what I was expecting and the book is hard to use. I should have looked at some of the pages before I purchased two of them.
1,Defective book,"I have puchased this book twice from Amazon (and returned it) then went to Books a Million to find it and all of the books have the same defect. The section on words that start/end/contain the letter ""A"" is missing from the book."
1,not worth it,"A good idea, but its flaws defeat its purpose. The 2-letter word list is out-of-date: no AG, AL, EX, EM, MO, MU, NE, SH, WO, and XU; and an added DA that shouldn't be there. And the promised 3-letter list is missing."
5,Scabble Word Finder,I really like using Scrabble Word Finder. It has really helped my wife and I play the scrabble on Dish Network.
1,The Listless Word-Finder,"This was an extremely frustrating book to read. There were many gaps in the word lists. The two letter word list only contained 85 of the 96 acceptable two letter words. It was missing ag, ex, hm, mm, mo, mu, ne, uh, um, wo, and xu. All of those words are contained in The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary (1995) but not contained in this 1998 edition based on that dictionary. The Three Letter Words from Two Letter Words also had many gaps. The very first two letter word (AA - cindery lava)only listed BAA, and totally missed AAH, AAL, and AAS. This is just one of many, many, omissions through out the book. The only benefit I found in having the book was in finding some words which contain a particular letter in the middle or the end of the word. But even these lists were incomplete. This book is not worth the investment."
1,less than one star,"This was an extremely useless book. It lacked many words and was very hard to use. I wish I had read the other reveiw before I bought it. How can this be called ""Official"" when it is lacking in so much information? For example, DA is listed as a two letter word in the book, but was actually removed from the official dictionary in 1998. And, many words that ARE acceptable in the dictionary are not listed at all. This can really mess a player up. If you want to lose at the game, use this book. Otherwise, just don't buy it."
1,Buyer Beware,"I, too, wish I had read the reviews before buying this useless book. I purchased it thinking it was a different book, an excellent one I recall from the 1980s, that actually had useful lists. In addition to the problems mentioned by other reviewers, I warn that the print in this book is very tiny, jammed together, and somewhat blurred."
1,dissappointed,"unfortunatly when I ordered this product I understood it was a full word finder for scrabble, but it is not, it does not have all words starting with vowels e.g.e a i o u in fact it doesnt have any catergory at all with words starting with vowels very dissappointing , secondly i only ordered one copy and recievied 2 which I had to pay for and cant get any one to but it even as a second hand book, as the old saying goes once bitten twice shied and I am $57.00 (nz) up the creekGus Thomas"
2,"Not to bad, but the internet is still better","The book is ok IMO, lots of words in there and good strategies but I have to say that I still find it easier to use websites like [...] to do the same thing. Makes it much easier :)"
1,Probably a counterfit,"This book is a rip-off. Several sections (""A"", ""I"", etc.) are missing. There is no index, so you're on your own trying to find useful information."
3,The Official Scrabble Word Finder,It's not what I was expecting... I was expecting a Scrabble word dictionary... I guess I should have read the description better and/or paid closer attention.
2,THE OFFICIAL SCRABBLE BRAND WORD FINDER,I do not like the set up of this book. It is difficult to find words when you need them.
3,Scrabble Book - Word Finder,"This book has a lot of helpful information, but it is very hard to navigate. They also don't include words that start with vowels. They list 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 letter words then they list words that contain that letter. There is no table of context, so you have to hunt each time you use the book to find the letter you are looking. They do have a lot of words in the book"
2,Wish it had definitions.,We wonder what the words mean. When we play we like to learn new words. But what is the use of meaningless letters?
2,not what I expected,It was not easy to use. I am an avid IPad scrabble player; this was not helpful for finding goodf words.
5,Good book,"This is a good book although print is very small in it. However, I use a magnifying glass and that helps. Very comprehensive!"
1,wrong,falling apart the letters are extremly small this book was more than used took awhile to getto my address
4,The Official Scrabble Word Finder,This is a very good book once you get used to using it. It would help is this book were offered in large print. The extra sections in the back are of great use.
5,how accidents can be funny.,"Very funny, it is for the whole family. My grandson was laughing the whole time. He is 5 years old."
4,Cute dvd,Pretty good value for the money. Had some very cute videos on it. I wouldn't spend much more on it.
5,great laughs,We love AFV every week. Now we can watch some of our favoriate stuff when ever we want to. Love the babies & animal.
5,Perfect for seniors battling dementia.,"I ordered this for my father who is suffering with dementia. He laughed hard like he used to, tears in his eyes. He can watch it over and over and be happy which in turn makes us happy."
2,Not impressed,"I agree, the ""commercial breaks"" are annoying, along with the cheesy centaur jokes/hosting. I'd look for a newer dvd."
2,terrible,"Some of the video clips are funny but the rest was like a train wreck. The video set-ups by Bob Sagat and his two ""actors"" seemed ad-libbed and forced. It was to the point of agony to get to the next group of videos. I don't see my wife and I ever watching it again. I only hope the other one I bought her is better. Of course we were so scarred from this one, we haven't watched it yet."
3,Well Researched.,"Good information and well researched, it is a safe book. One I'm sure those in academia will be comfortable with because it reads like a thesis. I do prefer the real life experience books such as East Side Stories, Always Runing and The Last Street Fighter over these sociological and academic genre books which often read like a text book."
4,Good Book For Sociology,I ordered this book to use for my Sociology IA and it is really informative. It includes statistics and analysis. I would recommend this because it gives you an idea of how widespread the issue of teen gangs and delinquency is. The book I received was an Ex-Lib but in great condition.
3,Alec steals the show as usual,Alec Guinness was one of the best actors of his day and this movie displays this well. In this is he plays a dishonest promoter. But his character is likable and not malicious. He starts out at the beginning as a worker at a morgage company and at the end is a mayor. Along the way you see the mischievous ways he builds himself to the top.Glynis Johns is especially good as a gold digger he meets. His reply to her about her gold digging is very amusing. Other than Alec the second reason I got this was because it stars a very young brunette Petula Clark. Unfortunately her character is under developed.The Promoter is not in the league of his other movies like Last Holiday and The Ladykillers but it's enjoyable.
4,Charming lighthearted romp,"Alec Guiness is an opportunistic young man on his way up in the world. He sets out to make his fortune, by hook or by crook. Rising above his class, he succeeds in a most charming way."
2,Worked great....until it quit!,"I bought this iron and really loved it at first. Light weight and lots of steam. Until one morning I went to turn the iron on and nothing happened. I thought it might be a bad plug, so I moved to another plug end. This iron is completely dead. It has not been dropped or misused in any way. I will never but an iron from this company again."
1,Expired right after the warranty did,"First experience with a Shark and I actually liked it...lightweight, good steam, auto-off so you don't accidentally leave it turned on...until it stopped working! I don't iron much so really thought it should last longer than a year and a half. When I turn it on, it gets up to heat and works for minutes before the red light starts flashing and it goes into auto-off as if it was sitting. The manual says to ""gently rock it back and forth"" to basically wake it up. Would not wake. Had to unplug and plug it back in. Called Shark and best they would do was give me about 14% off a newer upgrade since it was out of warranty. Clearly the mercury-switch or whatever they use now to determine whether it is in use is faulty. I will not give Shark another opportunity. Disappointed."
3,Electronic iron,"The package arrived fairly late (at least two weeks) and wasbadly damaged. Although the iron was to be new, it hadbeen opened and perhaps used. Was not satisfied with the service."
1,worst ever,"This is the worst iron I have ever owned.I do not recommend. The first one stopped working after a month. My biggest complaint is the placement of the temp. button on top of the handle. I am constantly having to reset the temp. because as I'm ironing my hand hits the button and either turns off or changes to a different temp. Horrible design, I need to replace this piece of garbage ASAP! I HATE IT!"
1,Cost more than it's worth,"I've had this iron for about a year now. At first it was wonderful. Now, though, it leaks brown water all over the place and stains my clothes. I've had to throw out two nice shirts. I had to buy a new iron because it was cheaper than replacing my stained clothes."
2,"Lots of steam, lots of dribbling, shoddy design","The nice thing about this iron is that it puts out a LOT of steam. The other nice thing...well, that's about it.I've had this iron for just a few hours, and here are the bad points:- Chrome started flaking off the body as I was taking it out of the box- Along with the steam, this unit dribbles and drools almost constantly- Auto shutoff is advertised as 7-9 minutes -- it varies between 3 and 15 minutes, which means it shuts off when I turn around to pick up another shirt, or takes too long to shut off for safety.In all, a wholly unsatisfying purchase."
3,Good While It Lasted,"I owned this iron for about 6 months before I had to replace it. It worked great while it lasted. However, I expected it to last longer. I particularly liked how well it steamed without dripping. Also, the steam burst and water jet functions worked VERY well. I liked the flashing lights which told me when it was up to heat or if it had stopped heating (auto shut off) while I was using it. I have pain in my hands, but found the iron easy to manuver. I did not like how the rubberized portion of the handle was on top rather than on the side your fingers grip. The chrome coating on that side wore off quickly. I also wished the iron had a retractable cord. I was very disappointed when suddenly the thing wouldn't heat unless I held it at a very odd angle. Needless to say, I couldn't iron with it at that angle. It's a shame because until then, it had been the best iron I'd owned in the last 15 years."
2,Barely worth the money,"I read a lot of reviews before buying this iron and really thought I would have a winner this time. The first and major problem I have had with it is leaky water during steaming - when the iron had fully heated. The second thing that I don't like about this iron is that it shuts off quickly - in about 3 minutes when not being used - and to reheat the iron, you have to push the control button repeatedly to get it to the hottest setting - it takes 10 pushes to get it to the ""max"" setting on my iron as some of the pushes don't seem to register on the electronic control.The only ""saving grace"" of this iron is that it puts out a lot of steam (and water)."
5,Best little iron in the world,It is the best iron I have ever owned. It is lightweight and does a wonderful job. I almost enjoy ironing again
1,Worked less than two years with infrequent use,"I bought this iron in April 2011 and it has become inoperable at 17 months. I used it about once every three weeks so the usage was not very high. Has a design flaw in that the setting control button was located on the handle so it was easy to accidentally touch the button and change the temperature. It had a comfortable weight and heated quickly, too bad it wasn't made to last. I rate this iron 1/5."
1,Don't buy this iron,"I absolutely hate this iron. It doesn't get hot enough to take the wrinkles out of the clothes. I must say that whoever designed this iron apparently never tried it. The temperature button is right where you hold the handle so you start out with it at the highest setting because it doesn't get hot enough, but as you iron your palm hits the temperature gauge and before you know it is either on low or off. Time to find a new engineer to make a better product!"
2,Broken in 3 years,"Great at first, then after a month or two the steam button got stuck and wouldn't come out. Now 3 years later it keeps shutting off every time I try to iron. When its on its heel the lights are on and it heats up, try to iron and everything shuts off. I'm not very impressed with Shark's quality on any of their products."
2,Fantastic iron that doesn't last very long,"I have bought two of these irons in the past 3 years. I really loved my first iron - lightweight, great steam, makes ironing easy. However, the first iron's steam button broke (became jammed and was unfixable). I loved the iron so I wanted to give it a second chance. I bought the second iron about 1 1/2 yrs ago and it has been working great just like the first one. However, now the cord is faulty at the point it attaches to the iron and the iron will not stay on. If I hold the cord just right, it will stay on. Not made to last. Won't buy a third."
1,do not buy this iron,"After only one year, this iron quit. Nada. Nothing. It was OK while it lasted, although it tended to spit, but a year is simply not long enough for a small appliance to last. I usually iron about one hour per week, so it was not overused."
1,A HOT MESS!,"This iron was purchased as a birthday gift for me in late September. SIX WEEKS LATER, it just completely stopped working; no electrical current, no nothing. I was torn about whether to exchange it for a replacement or just return it for a refund. It was upon seeing all the reviews here on Amazon.com that I realized that this was not just a faulty iron, it is a faulty product. It is a very heavy, seemingly sturdy steam iron with all the bells and whistles that turned out to be A HOT MESS!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IRON,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEYI've had two of these irons in less than 6 months and both have broken almost immediately in the same location. The steam button stops working!Don't buy this product it's terrible and the company is doing nothing to replace it after less than 8 weeks!!!
4,"For light ironing, I recommend it.","The iron is good at what it does, but I'm also on my second one as the first stopped working after about 3 months (the buttons to change heat settings stopped working, and it was replaced by the manufacturer). Otherwise, the heat is nice and the steam is very nice. I don't think this iron is built to last, thus for the money I give it 4 stars."
3,Mixed,"Thot this was higher quality as it was more expensive than others when I bought mine at Walmart. After 1 year first was stolen when my apt was robbed, I bought another as first seemed to work pretty good. 2nd not nearly as good as the first though... darn thing shut off all the time and never warmed up like the prior, harder to iron with. I got tired of the constant timeouts and having to button through 5-6 settings to get to max all the time. After 2 years with my last one and it has died--in otherwise very good condition. Some pluses: Base never leaked and base plate looks excellent yet after 2 years of daily use. Never had issues with sticking (partly because iron never got hot enuf even at max setting). Long cord that came with it was nice--at least they didn't cut too many corners. But perfectly good iron and it's now just dead. No user replaceable fuses included. 1 year warranty. Seems nobody builds things to last anymore."
3,Snarky Shark,"I just purchased this Shark 1468 to replace my Black & Decker which gave me headaches from day one (guess I got the lemon in the batch).. I've only used the Shark once & like the way it irons in comparison to the B&D; & like the steam flow.. I was hoping to get an iron that did not have auto shut off but alas I don't think those exist anymore.. The only problem I personally have with this iron & this could be the way I hold it I'm not sure, but when I iron my hand accidentally hits the ""Fabric Selector"" button & that automatically changes the fabric setting on me(small hand).. So I will have to learn to hold the iron differently or this will become a big issue for me..I have decided to take this iron back to the store.. The issue with the ""Fabric Selector"" was a big issue for me since I couldn't change the way I held the iron to use it.."
3,Work almost well for 18 months.,"This iron work well, not fantastic, stop working about 1.5 years after light use (I'm divorce), drip water in low temperature, have to wait to have it hot after fill full of water, the hole of the plate get salt and dust the dark cloth, you have to let clean down in a towel."
3,Looks cool but isn't,"I've owned a lot of irons in my life. Most only last a year or so in my house. This one is going strong after two years, which I appreciate. If you iron a lot, and I do, I would personally recommend the Black & Decker brand of irons that have teflon on the heating surface. You will be amazed at how much easier it is to iron with a teflon surface. For $30 the Shark is ok but if you can spend $10-$20 more and get an iron with a teflon heating surface."
2,Auto Off,"This iron has an auto off feature, so it is supposed to turn off if you don't move it for a while. Mine turns off right in the middle of using it, and the only way to get it to turn on again is to unplug it."
1,Don't buy this iron.,"I'm sorry I bought this iron. It has auto shutoff which I don't like but have gotten used to since all irons are like that. My major beef with this is after is shuts off and you move it to start it again you have to move it to the setting you want. It doesn't return to the setting you had before. I don't turn my irons off, when I'm done I unplug them and when I plug them back it to use again, you have to reset the setting. Shouldn't have to constantly reset it."
1,Wasted money,"I should have read the reviews but didn't. Saw this iron at Costco at a great price (now I know why) and brought it. Used it one day and it doesn't work. I also threw the directions away because I usually have no problems with irons that I buy. Well for this one, I should have kept the instructions because I don't even know where to start to see if I can get it to work. Don't waste your money on this iron and yes I can say that I should have read instructions but it's just an iron who needs instructions to plug an iron into the socket. No such thing with this lousy iron. I'm going to see if I can take it back. Now I know, don't buy cheap irons they're exactly that. CHEAP!!!!"
3,"read, read, read","nice iron and does a good job but..... YOU HAVE TO READ THE DIRECTIONS, more than ONCE to work the thing"
3,Over Rated,"I bought this iron at Target 2 days ago and I was very excited for the no drip feature. What a mistake this iron is. It does iron very nicely, but the problem is that is leaks. Any time you want to burst the steam the water sprays outs. I cannot wait for this iron to go back. I am ordering a different one today! Save your money and your clothes! If it worked as good as it looks we would be in good shape!"
1,Worst iron in 40 years of ironing,"I bought the iron in December and in April it did not work. There was a short in the cord--if I moved it one way the iron came back on and if I moved it the other way it went off. I did have problems with the button (or whatever you want to call it) that adjusts the heat. It is flush with the handle where one holds the iron and the heat would go down if my hand happened to put pressure on it. I would learn to live with it if the whole thing had not quit. I can't receive my money back from the store where I purchased it because it was past 90 days. I did call the company to let them know about my complaints. They just wanted to send me a new iron. Forget that!! Why would I want another iron like that? I just hope the service rep passed on my complaints. I did like the lightweight iron, but decided that maybe I just need a heavier iron. I iron about 2 hours a week."
1,Don't waste your money,Loved this iron until it just stopped working. I only had it for a short time before it would no longer heat up.
1,Do NOT buy!,"This iron only lasted about seven months before it broke down. Like someone else wrote, the steam button got stuck in the down position. Piece of junk. Don't waste your money! I gave this NO stars."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This is another piece of junk manufactured in China.After having the iron for approximately 3 months (long enough for the warranty to expire) the surge steam button stopped working. It's always been difficult to handle as it has a tendency to fall forward when not on use due to the cord position.After an hour long conversation with someone at their customer service that could hardly speak English and didn't understand half of what I was saying, I was given the option of returning the iron for repair for a mere charge of $25.oo (with $8.00 shipping charge.) I opted to keep the piece of junk since I only paid $39.99 plus tax for it to begin with!Needless to say, I'll not be buying any Euro Pro products in the near future."
2,Stop working after 16 months,"I was ironing when this iron suddenly stopped working. The indicator light went dark, and I have to get a new iron. This happened only 16 months after I purchased it. Other than this fact, I have no other complains."
2,One of Best Irons I've owned till 6mo then it LEAKS,"Every positive thing stated in other reviews is true: best steam, lightwt for arthritis, great gliding soleplate, convenient long cord...simply one of the best irons I've ever owned (and that's saying a lot over a few decades)BUT, at least for me, approximately six months after buying, it leaks A LOT. I baby my irons because I use them so much and was disappointed that I will have buy another one so soon simply because it leaks so much that i can't use this one to iron clothes right before i want to wear them."
3,Very Pleasing,"LeFanu is one of the top-tier ghost-story writers. Although M.R. James reigns supreme over that particular domain, LeFanu is one of its princes (as is Oliver Onions, though I don't believe that the same can be said for the curiously overrated H.P. Lovecraft). This particular collection will be a joy to any and all enamored of classic ghost stories -- despite unmistakable redundancies and Lefanu's fondness for excessively oratund language."
2,You call this teaching?,"Dr. John is one amazing piano player. You'll certainly be thoroughly impressed with his trills and lightning quick fingers. BUT WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE TELL HIM TO SLOW DOWN A LITTLE? What's the point of teaching if all he does is play at mach speed? He can't help but add his fancy touch, which is fine for a performance, but not for a ""lesson."" And when you do hit the right notes it doesn't sound the same anyway. Unless you have some way of playing this CD in half speed I would not recomend this so-called ""lesson"" book unless you want to be screaming at the thing like I am to ""slow down superstar."" The book does however give a good basis for New Orleans blues and you get hear some cool stories. This guy should stick to performing. I'd hate to hear how patient he must be in volume 3."
5,Ms K Ervin has done it again,"This book was such an invigorating story. It has it all, the ups, downs, and the inbetweens. When I read ""Me & My Boyfriend"" I was impressed by the writers knack for storytelling. This, of course, inspired me to purchase Chyna Black. I'm so glad that I did. A heartfelt autobiography based novel, this book let's all young women know, we all having a ""star"" inside of us. Just reach for it and ladies the sky is the limit. I recommend this novel to readers from all walks of life."
5,Great Urban Tale,"This book was great, well written and a page turner. It really sends a message on how important it is to stay focused in life and how easy it is to lose yourself to someone else. The author also expresses that its never to late to make a change and do the things to ensure your own happiness. The author's delivery was very descriptive, and entertaining. I really enjoyed reading this book."
4,CHYNA BLACK,the book was hot...a lil fast at the end trying to wrap the book up...u wanted to know more about the happenings of the other characters...but how this story can be a revelation to sum defeated young woman out there..is amazing...good job
4,loved it,"i loved it. it wasnt better than ""TORN"" but this was definitely a good read. CHYNA SEEMED SO REAL.I READ THIS AS SOON AS I GOT OFF WORK AND I WAS DONE WITHIN A FEW HOURS. KEISHA HAS 2 MAKE A PART 2 TO CHYNA'S STORY CUZ I WANNA KNOW MORE. I WASNT READY 4 IT 2 END. KEEP IT UP GIRL...PATIENTLY WAITING FOR GUNZ & ROSES 2 BE RELEASED..."
3,Lessons in Life,"It was a good book based on an autobiography. There are messeges of hope and encouragement for those who are drawn into the game - there is a way out. Chyna was special and blessed with determination, despite the mine fields that were in her path. She matured through and by her circumstances; and was able to keep her head above water as she waded through waters in her latter teen years. I enjoyed the book and think other readers will also."
5,Best Ever!,"Keisha has done it agian, this book has really taught me about life, i am young and i can feel what chyna was going threw with her mom and how she was blinded and couldnt see her life without her man tyreik, sometimes it makes me wander, why do women do those crazy things for men. Keisha taught me in this book, that every body makes me mistakes and it dosent matter what the circumstances are, this book will open up the eyes for young teenage girls my age, who will do anything and evrything for they man, and KEISHA THANK YOU you taught me so much and gurl i hope your next book is better than your last 2!"
5,Can I Get Some More Stars !!!!,"Oh My God! This book is the bomb! This book was like a drug, I couldn't eat without reading this book, and sleep, what's that? I couldn't do that until I finished this book, read it in one day. On the real this is a very good story for teenager and older women I mean I think it's fair to say that a lot of us have found our selves in a situation similar to Chyna. And it's really sad to love someone that hard, and I'm speaking for both Tyreik & Chyna, because he really did love her he just didn't know how to do it right, and that also goes for her mother, she loved her with tough-love, but is that always the right way? Sometimes it can be mistaken like in this case. I can't say all I want to becasue then I will be given the story away, and I don't want to spoil it for anyone, Just go out get the book, and enjoy it, cause Ms. Ervin did the Damn Thang on this one!!!"
4,Chyna and Ty,I enjoyed this book. It goes to show that you can never run away from true love. You can try and fight it but when it's true love it worth fighting for and giving second chances. If you are looking for a good life story then this is the book for you.
5,real hood,"at first i thought this book was gonna be lame & boring, i wasn't looking forward to it ..then the more i got into .. the more i couldn't put it down . it was so addictive , the characters, the realness .. shawty got gifts and she inspired me even more to continue writing .. and READING <3"
4,chyna Black,It was a good read...not better than Torn...but I can read more than once....some of the story I would have liked to have played out diffrent but stil recommend you buy
5,More Please,The only thing bad about this scarf is there aren't more like them. Hennanation should expand their line!
4,Cradtsman architecture,"A series of articles with illustrations from the original ""The Craftsman"" magazine. Includes both houses and furnishings. A must for Arts and Crafts enthuisiasts."
2,An OK Read,This book has very poor sructural building plans. It informs of the classic arts and craftsman period and how it effected design. It did not inspire nor reveal any proceedure's on how certain designs were accomplished.
2,There are better Craftsman Books,I was dissappointed in the poor illustrations and lack of depth on the topic.
5,Working fine...no prob..,"Replaced both O2 sensors on my VW Golf after getting DTC for O2 sensor prob. Plug n play pretty much with the right tools. Be sure to use a small O2 sensor socket for the sensor on the catalytic converter as the large O2 sensor socket has no room to fit. Although DTC for O2 sensor gone now, started getting P0422 cat converter code. Probably not the fault of the new sensors..."
5,"Excellent, just as I remembered it...","It was just as I remembered it. I love all the songs and my children and I which range from 11 years of age to26 sat and watched the whole set, and by the ned remember all the songs. I remember as a child how much I loved Electric Company and how it helped me to read anything, by pronouncing it, in today's scholly system, kids are taught to remember the word, and not really sound it out. It was the BEST purchase ever. With Morgam Freeman, Rita Moreno, and Bill Cosby, teaching and making you laugh and sing out loud how can you go wrong. If you loved it as a kid you will love it now."
5,I hope there's more on the way!,"Being a child of the 1970's, I was naturally thrilled to learn that THE ELECTRIC COMPANY was making the rounds to the TV-on-DVD market. Having already purchased it, I can only hope they plan on releasing more volumes in the upcoming months. The show bridges many gaps between the generations and its greatness lies, not only in it being educational, but vastly entertaining as well. It even threw in some subtle ""adult"" humor as well. I'm glad the Shout Factory has compiled this ""best of"" retrospective, but I do hope there's more on the way."
5,My four-year-old loves the show,"When Noggin aired episodes late at night a few years back, I had the forethought to tape a few hours of it. I now have a four-year-old who is going to destroy my tape soon, she loves it so much! (Just like I did at her age.) I hope this set will be substantial...I'd buy full seasons for her if I could get them."
4,We love the EC!,"OK, so I bought this more because I watched this show in the 70's as a kid...but my kids have gotten a kick out of the groovy 70's fashions and hair and I think may actually be learning something, too!"
3,Previews not kid appropriate,"This is a great set of DVD's for this show. However, I do think parents should be aware of the previews for other shows that seem targeted to the 30-something crowd and not something I would want my 4 and 7 year old to see. For example, there is a scene in one of the preview ads for a show where a girl asks a guy, ""so, you want to have sex?"" NOT a DVD that you can just pop in for your little kid and walk away. I was VERY disappointed in this marketing ploy."
5,Doesn't anyone remember Irene Cara??,"Like everyone else, I am thrilled that my favorite childhood show will be released in some form on DVD very soon. I also agree that they should release all episodes as there seems to be a market out there.But when people mention all of the obvious famous alumni from the show (Morgan Freeman, Rita Moreno, Bill Cosby, etc.) they never mention IRENE CARA. My absolute favorite Short Circus member. Irene, of FAME, and the FLASHDANCE theme fame, was one of the band members, but I do not believe that she was on the show for all seasons. She sounded awesome as a young teen and she was one of the main reasons I watched the show. (Check her out on the LP record! ""Hard, Hard, Hard"" specifically.)I can't wait!! Woohoo!!"
4,poor choice of previews.,"While I must certainly remark on the sheer genius of both the educational AND entertainmaint aspects of the show itself, I am greatly disappointed with the choice of previews. The previews include mature content that is really inappropriate for children at the learning to read age. I understand that people selling DVD's want to sell us more DVD's, however, poor judgement was used on this one."
4,it's helping,I bought this for my daughter who just entered 1st grade and was struggling with her reading & spelling. She absolutely likes the DVD and it's helping her with the basics of phonics and reading through skits and songs.
3,You Get What You Pay For,"I ordered this 3 weeks before I had to go on a camping trip. I realized I had lost the charger for my Coolpix and needed one for that upcoming trip. I ordered this - figured it's cheap enough to take a chance on. It definitely does what it's supposed to do. It charges considerably slower than any Nikon brand charger I have ever owned, which is understandable and is to be expected with any third-party charger. It came with a car charging accessory but was borderline useless considering most cars don't put out much voltage to begin with. I didn't order it for the car-charger anyway, so no big.If you have a lot of time to wait for a charge and a LOT of time to wait for it to be shipped to you (took me almost a month to receive and didn't get it in time for the trip, either.) and don't want to spend a lot - go for it!"
1,Ouch! Worse than bad for the LI-40!,I needed a travel charger for our two Olympus camers that use the LI-40 batteries. Unfortunately this unit does not work well at all.Pro:Charges quickly. I liked the indicator light and the folding plug.Con:It charged the batteries in about an hour - and the charges lasted about 40 minutes! With the stock charger the batteries last about 3 hours or so (of actual use). There is something wrong with the way this charger works.Conslusion:Don't waste your money - it doesn't work!
4,For fans of Shoe,"This is a nice collection of Shoe over the years, and really for fans of the comic strip rather than a more general audience. Of course, several of my favorites are not present, but the quirky characters are well represented. A surprise was a page of repetitions which was unexpected. The size of the book is a bit awkward for a bookcase. The book is divided by decades, and there are thumbnail pictures of MacNelly and friends, family, and pets."
2,Left me sort of sad...,"I think Shoe is a terrific comic, elegant at times, but this particular collection left me sad, as it focuses a great deal on both Jeff MacNelly and his son's deaths. Seeing all the pictures of Jeff throughout the book, on about every page, serve as a constant reminder of his death and got eerie after a while."
4,The classic Diesel loco,"If you remember the early diesel locos, or would like to remember them, but aren't old enough, this is a great little book. I admit being partial to EMD F-units. They were everywhere whenI was a kid, and have come to symbolize THE diesel loco as viewed by the general public.The design and the paint schemes that went with it are still considered the ultimate in railway design. This book, while brief and not all inclusive, is a good general review of the famed units. Unfortunately, too many pages and pictures are devoted to restored locos, and not enough to the classics in their natural environment."
2,The spring horse sent was not the one pictured !,"I took particular care to order the Radio Flyer with the adjustable stirrups and the step on because of the safety issues. I was quite aware that there were two types of Radio Flyer spring horses out there and I made sure the one I ordered was pictured with these features.I was so diaappointed when I arrived at my grandson's home and on Christmas morning found that the inferior spring horse had been sent.I feel like I am a victim of bait and switch. I am done with ordering from Amazon if items are sent from elsewhere. I don't feel I have any recourse, and have been duped!"
3,Radio Flyer Spring Horse,I got this as a gift for my grandson and overall it is a great toy. He loves riding it or even just sitting on it. The product description said it had adjustable stirrups and a padded seat. I was very selective and read the reviews so that I would choose the right one. It did not have either of those and they told me that they did not have any more in stock and could not replace it. They did offer to give me my money back and I could purchase it from another vendor. It took me and my husband an hour to assemble so we choose not to return it. The product description needs to be revised so that this does not happen to other customers.
1,I would love to be able to review this product!,"It seems Radio Flyer is having some quality control issues with this product. I ordered one for my daughter for Christmas and, two weeks after I placed the order, was told that Radio Flyer has not shipped any out yet due to difficulties with the assembly of the product. The mom-and-pop place from which I ordered the horse said that Radio Flyer hopes to start releasing the product by Friday, December 10th. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this is the case and the horse is shipped and delivered to our home in time for Christmas.Just be aware that if you order this for the holidays, there is absolutely no guarantee you will get it in time."
3,Hazardous,"Caution: My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES this horse. He rides it everyday, many times a day. It is only 2 months old and already the spring covers are destroyed and yesterday the S hook that connects the spring to the horse BROKE in half causing my son to fall. Fortunately, the wall 'caught' him or else he may have been impaled by the pole support of the horse and seriously injured. My son was left only with a bruise on his nose and hurt feelings because his horse was broken. We contacted Radio Flyer. They offered to ship us more S hooks, but somehow I think they lost the bigger picture of the safety hazard of this toy. I think and hope it will be recalled before an innocent child is seriously hurt or killed. Please consider this before purchasing. Thank you."
4,POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS INJURY!,"The first problem waswith the spring safety covers. The springs wore through the plastic covers after about 2 weeks and now the pipes and springs are exposed. The company sent me replacement covers, but I can't see that they will last any longer this time around. I'm actually surprised that no one else has mentioned this problem yet. Addendum:FIRST OUR SPRING COVERS WORE OUT IN TWO WEEKS. THEN A SPRING BROKE. THE BROKEN PIECE OF METAL WAS HURLED ACROSS THE ROOM AND HIT ME IN THE LEG. THE COMPANY REPLACED THE SPRING. NOW JUST AFTER ONE WEEK OF RIDING AGAIN, ANOTHER SPRING BROKE. MY DAUGHTER FELL OFF BOTH TIMES. I THOUGHT THIS WAS A QUALITY ITEM! RADIO FLYER HAS SOME MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THIS TOY, AND I'LL BE CALLING THEM AGAIN TOMORROW. THIS IS A DANGEROUS PIECE OF JUNK! DON'T BUY!"
4,big horse...big fun,"this horse is great. my only complaint would be that it is too big. my daughter 20 months cannot get on or off of it without help and at 25 lbs can hardly make it bounce. this doesn't bug her though. I love this toy because it one of the few that doesn't have lights and music to go along with it. I think that this encourages her to use her imagination more and gives her a chance to chill out while still playing. this is a great toy, and she will be able to use it for many many years."
5,Minimum Age Use,"If you purchase this item partly due to the minimum age of 18 months being listed, I suggest you waiting for at least 24 months of age for your little one. Our granddaughter is 26 months and is unable to get on or off the horse by herself in a safe manner. I believe that 30 to 36 months would be more realistic as a minimum age for use. Other than that, she loves to be on it and it is reasonably easy to assemble. Also, after reading other reviews, it would be a good idea to keep an eye on the springs and s-hooks for wear."
5,Excellent Toy. Even for 2 Rambunctious Boys.,"I have two boys ages 2 and 4(almost 3 and 5). They are typical boys that are rough and rambunctious! This has to be a durable toy to hold up to them! We received it as a gift about a year ago(used) and it still looks brand new! They push the springs to the limit by rocking as fast as they can, and rocking as far back and forward as the horse can go. When I am watching them on this horse I feel like they are in a real race to the finish line. To my surprise it has held up just fine!! It used to make me nervous them riding the horse so aggressively, but I am not concerned any longer! This is a great product! It is really big and takes up a lot of space, but it is worth it! They love it and it is safe! That is all that matters to me!"
5,hours of fun,"My children 4 and 2 love this horse. Also, anytime their friends come over this is the most popular toy. I highly recommend it. Very durable."
1,NOT FOR LITTLE ONE's & BAD QUALITY,"We got this toy as a gift. I put it together and the more I assembled the bigger it became. This thing is a monster - totaling almost four feet high and several feet wide - about the size of a large lazy boy.Next, the quality. This was not the Radio Flyer quality I remember as a child. The horse is 100% hollow plastic and when I originally opened the box the horses head was stuffed in it's neck which had crushed the ears - not an easy return when you get it in the mail.Age: My son is a little over one years old. Some websites say this is for 1 1/2 year olds other say 3. LET ME TELL YOU - I would NOT let a child under 5 on this thing! Even I can sit on it just fine as a full grown man! The child sits really high and the overall safety quality seems very poor. Save yourself some money and take the child to the supermarket and ride the electronic merry-go-round for a few quarters."
5,The spring horse was a hit!!,"I purchased this horse for my one year old, so she would have a toy to look foward to as she gets older. Me and my husband put it together in about 30 min. Some of the directions were not in proper order,but if you have a one year old, you are already used to puting things together. So overall it was a breeze to put together. I am definatly happy with this purchase, and I can't wait for my child to be able to ride it on her own."
4,Built Like a Tank!!,I bought this for my Son. He really liked it. It was fairly easy to put it together. And it was built very well for toys made these days. I bet it will last for years to come. Would Recommend to a friend.
3,"Easy to understand, harder to apply","Problem solving, according to Perkins, is a little like looking for gold. From there we draw analogies about the landscape and the different stages of problem solving itself: false hits, stuck in canyons, etc.There's no denying that such a description fits and anyone reading this book is going to recognise the very same limitations in there own thinking. The problem, however, is in the application. Though Perkins enjoys telling a few anecdotes where he coaches the person to a successful solution by highligting which of the thinking modes they're 'stuck in', in real life (and without knowing the final solution) it becomes something of a problem to apply.It's an enjoyable read but it kind of makes me wonder whether this book will lead to many 'euraka' moments."
4,as a non-scientist I loved it,"I never read ""science"" books. I bought the book because when I think ""breakthrough thinking"" I think about transformational work. I was pleasantly surprised to find out a lot of cool things about problem solving that I had never considered before.Yes, he gets scientific in the end, and the book doesn't quite flow, but, on the other hand I gained a perspective on why my life sometimes goes through bumps and spurts, and have gained valuable information in my daily troubleshooting life."
5,best I've seen on market,"Dramatized is better. Why try to hear in KJV, or a monotone voice. This has it all. I listen to it almost daily for 5+ yrs."
4,dramatized audio Bible,"I really like the dramatized Bible. Makes listening to passages come alive. CD's start and stop at the beginning and end of chapters, but some books are on the same CD as the previous books which makes hunting for a certain verse a little involved.CD's are numbered and clearly labeled as to books, chapters and verses on each CD all in a zippered case.Good price, fast delivery, great for easy listening or quick study."
5,NIV on CD,"Clear, easy to hear and understand. Nice case makes it convenient to keep in car for long drives and commutes. Good value."
5,"I Can't Believe I've Had This For Almost ""5"" Years!","I purchased this Bible CD series in 2002, and I have to tell you, it was one of the best things I have ever done. I listen to it almost everyday for at least an hour or more while I'm getting ready for work. What a wonderful way to start the day. We are very blessed today to be able to listen to the Bible on CD. I feel like Jeremiah talking to his scribe, ""would you repeat that last phrase please"", because you can replay a tract whenever and as often as you want. What an awesome opportunity for Christians today."
5,NIV Audio Bible Dramatized CD,I'm VERY HAPPY with my purchase. The product is of HIGH quality and HIGHLY recommendable. Plus the Amazon service is 100% specially considering that I live in South America (Paraguay). Thank you!
4,NIV Audio Bible Review,It is very convenient to have the entire bible on 6 CDs. I put this bible on my ipod. There is a track for every chapter which is great for searching the exact place you want to listen to. The narration is a bit cheesy at times. I believe that in many instances the background music does not fit well with the topics being read. Bottom line it is not very artistic. It is though provided at a very reasonable price compared to other audio bibles and it is God's word being read. I would buy this one again.
4,Great Product! High Quality Audio!,"Nice case, each CD lists the chapters on the label, so it makes it very easy to search verses... Some of the content seems a little too dramatized at times for me, but the readers do a great job at portraying emotion in the text. Highly recommended."
1,NOT AUDIO CD'S,"These are MP3 only. Whats missing from the picture is a gold circle in the upper left corner showing MP3. I ordered this because I thought I could listen in my cars 6 disc CD player. When returned, I only received 50% of purchase price."
3,David's emotion is too much,"In general I like it except for the voice of David in the Psalms. His emotion is not genuine and seems forced, as if he has a sharp object sticking him while reading. I believe it takes something away from the content, which is beautiful on its own."
3,"I loved the content - Rate a 5, audio control - Rate a 0",Content and dramatization perfect. Audio - I read other reviews before making this purchase and what others said is true....the volume is LOUSY. Even after turning the volume up on my laptop - I had to be right next to the laptop to hear.
4,Great CD's,I have really enjoyed this version of the Bible. It has made it easy to digest God's Word while I travel. I have used it to reinforce my morning devotions. I would recommend this item to every family.
2,1981 1982 Zondervan Coprporation,"I bought Zondervans 4 volume 48 cassettes in the mid 1980s and loved them. I listened to them so much that some of the tapes are worn out. I decided to buy them on MP3 instead of trying to record the still playing tapes into mp3 format using Windows Analog Recorder. I had hoped this was the same as the one made in 1981-1982, just put onto mp3. I was mistaken and disappointed. Some of the recordings are equal, but most are worse than the 1980-1981 recording. In particular I find Isaiah intolerable. I cannot listen to it it is so bad. I would like to buy the 1980-1981 recording again and put it into mp3 myself."
4,Worship in Spirit and Trust,"God is a Holy God. This product presents His Word in a reverent way, and can be used throughout the day to help keep us mindful of His presence - because the time is short when He will come to judge the inhabitants of this earth. Do everything you can right now to be ready."
1,way too over dramatized,"I was excited after reading the reviews but I am not at all impressed. These scriptures are almost hard to even take seriously as the are way to overly dramatized. None of the voices are normal and many don't even flow, as if the context of the reading was unclear. Romans is hard to even listen to as the tone changes and the speed is way to fast.Zondervan has made some great books but I don't think they accomplished the same level of quality on this product. I would avoid it and look for a different audio bible. Maybe not dramatized.Stephen"
2,NIV audio Bible,Very disappointed when I received this product because it is in MP3 format and does not play on my CD player.
4,Great Price,"Good value for the money. The general narration is awesome. I love listening to the cd's. The voices of the characters are overdramatized, unprofessional, and corny, which is somewhat distracting. However, overall, I would highly recommend this product."
4,Decent production,"I have just one thing to add to existing reviews. The Jesus character breathes in fast and heavy immediately before speaking (not normal inhaling). I suppose it's his technique to extend talking time. I find it distracting. I wish their audio engineer removed it during production. No other major complaint.Overall, good quality and excellent price. I compressed 64 CD's into 6 MP3 CD's and play them in my car during commuting."
3,Dramatized Bible CDs,"The product arrived quickly, but as I have been playing the CDs I have had problems with skipping recently. I am currently listening to 1 Peter and it has been skipping quit often. Not sure what to do--but it is very distracting."
5,Worth the cost,The NIV Audio Bible Dramatized CD is worth the cost. Listening to this Bible is easy and perfect for people who spend a lot of time in a car. The changes in voice help the reading not to become mundane.
4,NIV Audio Bible Dramatized,"This is a wonderful product. Having different voices for each of the different Biblical characters is a BIG PLUS!! Also, the background instrumental music is very subtle and adds quite a bit to the overall learning/listening experience."
5,An absolutely amazing band,"I heard this group for the first time in concert last night in Singapore at the Mosaic Music Festival 2007. The Straits Times review says it (almost) all: ""They conquered hearts and minds and set people free...call them the best little big secret this year's Mosaic has to offer...nothing could have prepared one for Jaga's heady 100-minute set...a breathtaking feat...compelled the famously sedentary Singapore crowd to stand up in awe."" They were mind-blowingly amazing and I have just ordered every CD they've ever cut. This group is one day going to be very, very big."
3,It's ok,A nice small collection of tiepolo's works. But I only gave it 3 stars because all the drawings are done by ink and bistre wash and the details are very hard to make out. The book does not include a wide range of his drawings.
4,"Great, but need more","I really like this album. I'm not a fan of ""christian"" music generally, but the songs here are too subtly beautiful to ignore. I used to own a CD of remixes of the song, ""Snow"" from this album... Somebody liked it so much I guess they ""borrowed"" it. Does anyone have any idea where I could find that? Searched Amazon until my fingers hurt with no luck. Thanks. You can reply to peterdeep at gmail.com."
4,Bit of a letdown.,"I bought this cd last summer when it came out and have waited months and months before my mini-review. This cd should be titled ""The Velvet Mission and Nico"". NOT a slam! Just reminds me of early Velvet Underground in many spots. I have TRIED to get into this cd and it didn't click with me until the weather started getting colder! I am not against artists trying something new...I thought U2's ""Pop"" was their best of the 90's and it was a bit of a departure. My favorite Innocence Mission song is ""Happy, The End"", not exactly an upbeat song. However, I would have enjoyed a little more quirk in ""Birds of My Neighborhood"". It's not ""Glow"" and I wasn't expecting it to be...I just still haven't warmed up to this disc totally. Maybe the next outing will be a bit BIGGER sounding. And I don't mean MORE production necessarily because Over the Rhine's best disc is a bunch of demos. I would like to hear Karen do a techno rave-up with the cast of Stomp! :)"
5,Imagine looking out the window...,"...and feeling content to simply gaze at the view before you. That is what listening to this album evokes for me. I first heard ""The Lakes of Canada"" on the radio, and was immediately spellbound. Checking it out online, I was slightly put off by the fact that it's often listed as Christian/Gospel, and that there is a cover of a John Denver song on the album. Not being a fan of either, I went ahead and got the album anyways, intrigued by the samples. My highest expectations were soon surpassed, by the words, music, and just the overall tone of the album. If you enjoy feeling content and at peace with the world, and listen to folk singers past and present, I highly reccomend this album!"
4,New Fan of Innocence Mission,"I'm a new fan of the Innocence Misssion. I took a friends suggestion, and recently bought this album - it's so good that I bought all their earlier albums.If you like groups loke the Sundays and 10,000 Maniacs, you'll like the Innocence Mission."
4,Summer Day Dreams,"As a fan of the Innocence Mission, this older album is right on track. Very pretty pictures and melodies painted with a light guitar and airy and sometimes shrill vocals. Good for a nap in the hammock"
4,Tender & Deliberative: A Pearl,"The Innocence Mission's Birds - A Tender & Lovely Gem.Birds is certainly not meant to be Glow Part Two.Fans have noticed that the Birds album has a wintry-snowy sensation ascribed to it. I would like to add that the CD has a feeling of transitions to it -- change is leading to growth & greater self-awareness. Birds is a meditative work.The lyrics are similar to intimate little sonnets written in a personal daily diary. In addition, the stark atmosphere of 'Birds' underscores the fragile, but intimate, nature of these lyrics. This disc is a fine example of modern-day Folk-rock.Birds -- a tender and deliberative pearl.August 21, 1999 -- Evaluation Tweaked"
4,Nice acoustic music,"I just recently found this CD, & decided to take a listen. It kind of surprised me. The simple, acoustic music was not like the acoustic music that had been overdone in the 90's. This is definitely a CD worth checking out."
4,No drums! Just winter sounds and Karen's voice.,"I thought Glow would be the last album Innocence Mission would do. It was far too perfect for any band to even consider following up. When I saw Birds was out, I immediately thought ""Oh, good idea to wait four years."" I didn't really notice until the second listen, but Birds of My Neighborhood has no drums. This wasn't a good thing at first, but after another listen, it's a very good thing. The album has no stand out tracks, but as a whole, it's magnificent and should be listened to all the way through.It may take some time to grow on you, but it's worth the wait."
5,Five years in the making. Mission complete.,"We have waited with baited breath for this band to release another album and it was worth it. The music and lyrics make you feel as if you have played this album your whole life. Karen's voice is it's quinessential self and the music that accompanies is the perfect mix. If you know of their work, you will quickly agree, If you don't you will certainly become a fan. Let's hope we don't have to wait five more years."
4,The W. in the Candidate,"One point of focus only: the irony that such a film has a moment where a black woman flashes a ""W"" sign at the candidate. The young and still hip candidate is able to interpret the meaning of the ""W"" sign...""peace, and up yours"". Is it not the sign of true art that it still speaks prophetically about the present time after 3 decades?"
1,Grade A all-American cheese,"This has got to be one of the funniest movies of all time. The movie itself has a serious tone, but it lends itself to so many jokes. Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans, this one for the collection!"
5,x,It is a great movie starring robert redford and peter boyle and was way ahead of it's time crocker JarmonMelvyn douglas is superb
5,Don't miss this chilling and mesmerizing movie.,"I first saw this movie during a college class. We had all stayed up late the night before, finishing our term papers, and the teacher apologized profusely for showing a long movie after we had a long night. But by the time the end credits rolled we were riveted. This 1972 movie is startingly relevent when it comes to today's political climate. As a once-blunt candidate who resorts to meaningless sound bites to please all of the people all of the time, Robert Redford's character is reminiscent of the politicans today who fight constantly for their survival and wind up having nothing to say. It appears that this movie is becoming forgotten, which is a shame. Rent it at your local store and blow off the dust; it's a well-kept secret."
4,Some Great Scenes,"Redford is great in his role and some of the scenes are absolutely classic. Very funny parts, especially the microphone scene."
2,Not what I remembered,For some reason I recalled this movie being better than it was. It is still a good movie for understanding campaigns.
3,Not quite sure..,"This rice had a definite earthy flavor, but it also had a slightly musty undertone, and a slight bitterness. I rinsed it well before cooking. The color was nowhere near ruby, but it was more of a medium dark brown with a reddish or slightly purple blush. I'll eat it, but I won't buy it again. It's too expensive and not special enough to justify the cost. I much prefer Lotus Foods Forbidden rice."
4,Great documentation of one of the largest Drag Shows,"The highlights of this film are the performances of the artists. There are a few doozies but, for the most part, they are great.There is no real theme or plot. It's basically video footage of the annual drag show held in New York. A very campy video to watch.Some of the commentaries are nice to add a bit of depth to the film. Wonderful contribution by Jackie Beat and Alexis Arquette! Alexis is hilarious!"
5,Wigstock - A Love Letter to New York,"Wigstock:The Movie is a colorful entertaining love letter to New York. It's all about drag, but it's also about one of the most unique cities in the world where crazy underground culture can flourish. It's a lot like the movie Woodstock but with better hair."
4,Let down your hair and have a ball.,"Since the golden age of Hollywood men in dresses have been a source of ammusement. Recent successes of The Adventures of Priscilla, Too Wong Foo, and The Birdcage proves that times have not changed.In this movie we move from a comical plot to a documentary surrounding the lives of the men, and some women, who perform, and in somecases live in drag. The musical numbers interspersed with interviews and commentary make for a fast paced, fascinating film.Only one thing keeps this film from being a 5 star film. The scene near the end where a performer appears to give birth and another adult, naked and covered with a red make-up to simulate blood burtst forth from the performer's costume.Other than that this is a great movie, which until recently had not been on the market.An interesting addition to any movie collection."
5,I havent heard the cd yet but its gotta be great,"I havent heard the cd yet but the songs I know off of it are real cool ""you can't be too Careful"" is a fruvous concert must have! All of their songs are cool and the names really dont matter"
3,Not quite my style,"Very Beatles-like in style throughout the album. Not your usual Fruvous. In my opinion, the best way to give your friends a ""typical"" representation of Moxy is to make them a mix tape, or else sell them on the ""Live Noise"" CD -- but not this one."
2,Don't bother with the bland CD,"I found this CD incredibly disapointing. I bought it at the same time as B and there could not be more of a difference between the two. Thornhill is full of songs that seem a little more pop-ish than is normal for Moxy Fruvous, though what I believe to be their true character does shine through on a few songs. Over all the CD is slow and rather bland, many of the songs are not memerable and they seem to flow together in my head. Compared to the outstanding quality of the other albums of their's I have been exposed too this one is almost not worth buying. I would encourage new Fruvous fans to begin with something more exciting and characteristic of Moxy fruvous such as Bargainville or You will Go To the Moon."
3,kind of disappointing,"this was my first mozy früvous cd. 2 years ago, my friend had me listen to King of Spain, and i immediately loved it, so asked my mother to buy me a moxy früvous cd. of course, i got thornhill. i listened to it a few times, but was kind of bored by it...it didn't sound at all like the fun, funny, intelligent stuff i'd heard on Bargainville. I barely listened to it at all, and it stayed in the back of my cd case for a while. then, just less than a year ago, i recieved Bargainville for my birthday. I was blown away by it and it became one of my absolute favourites. Moxy Fruvous became one of my very favourite bands, and I later bought You Will Go to the Moon, which i also adored. i now try to listen to Thornhill, but I find it to be rather mainstream compared to their other stuff. I do like Sad Girl and some others, but, overall, this does not represent moxy fruvous for me."
4,Thornhill,"The title refers to a very old brand of high-end hi-fi equipment. It was known for its ""smooth"" sound.That's this album, for sure, yeah. It is very, very smooth and lots of fun.And a little retro, too. Some of it sounds a lot like late-60s rock and roll, especially the keyboards.Very listenable - lots of fun, like all the Fruvous stuff..."
3,Don't evaluate the group on this album!,"In this album there are some glimpses of the typical Fruvous genius, but they are easily missed. The songs are generally bland and indistinguishable but their catchy wordplay and fun rhythms and vocalizing always win points. In the end though, Thornhill just doesn't match the standards of their other work. For a similar but better album, buy ""Wood"", or even better buy ""Live Noise""!"
4,"Get it, watch the extras","Great guerilla indie film making. I was lucky to see it on the big screen at a film fest. The director Brian Flemming is an inspiration for all want-to-be film makers. Solid performances, especially David James. The underlying social commentary is very of this moment."
3,"GRITTY, GRIM AND GRIMY THRILLER","I FOUND THIS MOVIE HARD TO WATCH AT TIMES BECAUSE OF THE SLIGHTLY CLAUSTROPHOBIC ATMOSPHERE THE FILM HAS. EVEN THE CAST (WHO ARE ALL GOOD ACTORS) SEEM SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE SCRIPT, MAYBE THATS WHAT THE DIRECTOR HAD IN MIND. WHAT'S OBVIOUSLY INTENTIONAL IS THAT DEBORAH HARRY HAS BEEN MADE TO LOOK AS BAD AS POSSIBLE IN JUST ABOUT EVERY SCENE SHE'S IN (AND SHE'S IN JUST ABOUT ALL OF THEM). SHE OBVIOUSLY DOSENT MIND SHEDING THE GLAMOUR GIRL IMAGE FOR FILMS. THIS MOVIE WOULD PROBABLY MAKE AN O.K RENTAL FOR GROWN-UPS"
4,"Taste great, but no Cilantro (read ingredients) also MSG :(","I thought this was the miracle sauce/marinade. Unless it's a typo, the second ingredient is Coriander and NOT Cilantro. It also contains mono-sodium glutamate. That said, I will buy again."
1,"I'm ""Hooked on Ebonics""","In a rather obvious parody that was slapped together with the same speed as the Killian documents, and probably with the same default settings, we have half the chuckles we paid for. If you are amused by this book's title you could, quite frankly, drink a six pack of beer and write this yourself and probably be just as funny. If you have any half way funny friends you could write a better book than this, probably with the same six pack of beer.Ebonics itself, and the schadenfreude it inspires in author ""I. B. White,"" is tragically beyond parody and firmly in the territory of pitiable. If it was a cultural artifact inherently capable of being the basis for humor, it would need to be formed in simultaneously more deft and cruel hands, such as the late Michael O'Donoghue.I be trippin if you be buyin dis book fo hew-mo lik dis, fo sho."
5,"I read the book, and now I'm black","After buying and reading this book, I magically transformed from an old, fat white guy to a young, thin, black man. Well worth the money. Now off I go to increase racial awareness."
3,Tom Selleck in his TV-movie debut,"Tom Selleck was so young at this point in his career that he may not yet have grown any hair on his chest. (Since he never takes his shirt off, however, we can't be sure.) The premise here is intriguing: an arsonist is setting fire to film studios and movie theaters in an attempt to destroy all prints of a particular motion picture. But why? The answer's a bit disappointing but a solid cast still makes this worth a casual viewing. There's not only Tom Selleck but also Arthur Kennedy, Frank Campanella, Warren Oates, Jeff Corey, Robert Webber, Russell Johnson, Nita Talbot, Severn Darden, Elisha Cook jr, and Henry Jones. Now if only some way could have been found to show Tom Selleck taking a shower!"
4,Not a bad trike,"We gave this trike to our son for his third birthday. He's pretty tall, but he had no problems reaching the pedals. Took a bit to put it together, but that's the case with any new trike/bike product and the seat kept wanting to slide down, even after tightening. Eventually, my husband got the seat to stay. If your child is over 3 feet tall, you should be able to adjust the seat enough to get his/her legs to the pedals."
1,Pit Wheeler Chopper,Terrible product...doesn't go together right...just not something I would recommend at all.
4,More please,"The second volume of the sect starts reprints from Issue 6.We see the Green Lantern Corps for the first time, an involved story of the Guardians and GL's greatest foe Sinestro.Plenty of Kane and Fox what more can anyone ask?"
1,No. Just....no.,"My disappointment in this album is enormous. I so wanted to get a ""School Years"" book for my children like I had as a child. My mother found this one, had it shipped to us, and we just received it today. I can't believe how ugly it is. It's simply a spiral-bound collection of photocopied forms (some are even crooked). It looks like it was made by someone without a creative bone in their body.Other reviews have mentioned loving the ability to record their child's milestones throughout their school career. Yes, it's true that you can do that in this book. But I'm telling you, there must be a thousand prettier and more creative ways to do so.If I can't find the same type of ""School Years"" book I had as a child, I'm going to get one of those scrapbook-making kits and just do one myself. (I'll let you know when they're for sale.) ;)"
5,Great Book,"Using my ""School Years History Album"", has helped me very much and as I look back in my book, it brings back many fond memories that I would not be able to remember otherwise. The author is very innovative and I am glad that I have ""My School Year History Album""."
2,Functional but not what I'd expected,"I bought this book as a momento book for my 2nd grader. It has a good selection of line items and spaces for memories.It is a spiral bound book of laminated and non-laminted pages. It wouldn't have been hard for me to make my own using some colored paper and a printer. Also, there are no pockets for momentos that we like to save... report cards and small pieces of artwork.There are some little stick-on pockets included with the book that are meant to hold pictures in place. They are the right size for wallet sized photos.I will use it ""for now"" and get a nicer quality item when I find one later on."
5,concerned parent in atlanta,...BR> One day while surfing on amazon.com i found my school days.I ordered it and knew immediatley that it was the perfect tool to help me update and stay on top of my childs magnificent development.This book is great for anyone who is serious about recording the wonder years of children.
5,Fun show,"Nice to watch a fun show. Brian Keith and Daniel Kelly where a good team in this show. The set is good quality with a lot of hours to enjoy. New shows are too serious or just plain lame! I gave up on TV and buy old shows now, after all how many CSI's and reality shows can a person watch?"
3,Old TV series,"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas - he was thrilled with it. It is nice to be able to see the shows with no commercials - but keep in mind these are old. The view is sometimes very gritty looking. Also the stunts - well they are old too. I love that he likes the series and is pacing himself only watching one a week. I have a hard time watching them as I want to laugh at the stunts and ""blips - goofs"" that you would not see in todays TV shows. The quality of taping is what it was for that time period; as long as you are aware of this you will not be disappointed in what you are getting. I do think that they were over priced but I could not find them anywhere else."
5,Gal in rare form,"This DVD shows Gal Costa with some incredible back up musicians, Veloso's arranger, Morellenbaum on cello, Luiz Brasil on guitar. The bossa ballads Gal sings go straight to the heart. Watch cuts of this on YouTube and you will want to own it."
3,"Nice, but...","The bugs are very hard to put on securly even by an adult. My son definately can't do it. The bugs are kind of fun by themselves, but the pillow is pretty worthless."
4,"Very Good for Kids, but Comedy Kings is better.","At least a dozen of these movies are also on Comedy Kings, but this is good for smaller kids. Buy Comedy Kings if you want a better set."
5,Best new band in the year 2000!,"This band is going places! Pam's vocals are amazing and the collective songwriting between Pam John, Bruce and Devin is excellent. I've seen the band in it's infant stages, even then they stood out. Now they are even more impressive. The band has a natural chemistry that makes people stop and listen, even in noisy bars and clubs."
5,lead guitar Rocks this band,This young guy has a natural talent. He is definitatly the LIFE and TALENT in this group.
5,A blast from my past,"I loved this book when I was a kid, and when my mom found my mangled copy, I was so excited to pass it along to my children. My son (5) loved the step by step directions, and was able use them to build confidence."
3,Nice book,Book cover came bent. But very nice drawing book. I will use this book in my art classes. The kids will love all the different animals.
5,Amazing drawing book,"I bought this for my 7 year old nephew but I've had just as much fun with it. There's a wide variety of animals and creatures in the book with patient, step-by-step how-to-draw illustrations for each. There are easy bugs and birds and then more difficult dragons so there's room to practice and grow. Children love how-to-draw books and this is one of the best I've seen. Highly recommended for a lot of creative fun!"
5,Awesome for 6 year old!!,This book has clear instructions that are very easy to follow. My 6 year old can sit down and in just a few steps complete a drawing.
3,an ok drawing book for younger kids,"It uses simple shapes to draw animals. Young kids, 4 year old or under should be able to follow it. Don't expect to draw pretty animals or show any imaginations from the drawing. It is an ok book for kids to kill some time by themselves because it is easy to follow. You can leave the book with kids and go do your own laundry. I don't think it is a good book for those who are serious about art and drawing."
1,unattractive,"The cover is the most attractive part of this book. Inside it is rather poky and the animals look easy to draw but not really worth the effort. They all have an over-simplified, stylized look that is neither childlike nor adult. I don't think it would be inspiring to a child."
5,Excellent book that kids will love,"I too loved this book as a kid, as opposed to other art books, this is easy to follow. I was imersed in every one of his art books and my greatest accomplishment in the 2nd grade was drawing that dragon! It took hours."
5,"Wonderful, classic children's instruction book.","As a kid, I loved to draw, and I loved this book! The author provides simple, step-by-step pictorial guidelines easy enough for young children to follow: if they can read the instructions, they can draw the animals in the book. At each step, there is a basic instruction such as ""make a green triangle"" or ""add two squiggly lines."" The instructions are accompanied by both a drawing of whatever it is to be added and a drawing of the animal-in-progress as a whole. Not only is this book fun for children, it's great for book reports and other school projects. Even adults will appreciate the ease at which this book helps them to produce realistic-looking animals while also enjoying the author's humorous style. This favorite book of childhood has become a cherished adult possession."
5,Great introduction to drawing,"My kids (ages 7 and 5) have loved this book. They have learned to follow the linear instructions and are so impressed with their ability to create. We also purchased Ed Emberly's ""Make a World"". Both are great for young learners."
5,use this book at work all the time,"This book is very helpful in my job working with elementary school aged children. It is fun to see their improvement in artistic ability on a weekly basis. I'm finding that it has also helped me to become a better ""artist"". There are many fun animals to draw and different ways to change characteristics of each animal. It's lots of fun."
4,"Easy to follow, great for little kids","My 5 years old boy has no interest in art. His drawing was way below other kids' level. He got his gene from me, no art talent. So I bought this book to try. We sat together and picked which one we would draw, and we painted for one full hour. He liked it, so did I.The book uses very basic shapes that kids can understand and control, such as shape of letter, squre etc... It was easy enough for my 5 years old to understand and follow. However, if your kids have great sense of art, let them go free drawing."
4,Good way to start!,"I bought this for my 5 year old who likes to draw but gets frustrated because he doesn't know how to make things look the way he wants; we did a few animals together and he's getting the idea. I'm no artist, but even I can follow the steps and have my drawings look like an animal. Fun!"
2,Not a good HD rederation,Sucks when you rush production and pass it onto an crappy company that can't render anything. Not worth paying for.
3,way too little content for too much money.,"This collection gives you enough behind the scenes stuff, that is not the problem. The problem is the price. It's priced 3 times higher than other well respected TV shows on bluray with not really any more content. Infact even less content. They don't even offer digital copies. I love star trek, and it looks better than you've ever seen it on TV, but at some point Paramount has to come back down to earth and price Star Trek atleast close to what other TV seasons are going for on bluray. With lack of digital copy and insanely high price, I have to just call this a lazy milking instead of a passionate release. For the price I am paying I expect to be able to watch these on my ipod touch so I can bring them with me wherever I go."
3,I Don't Know...,"I'm listening to this c.d. and I'm reading the reviews, and I just can't understand why the heck this is gettin good reviews. After listening to this disc a few times I can honestly say the hard rock songs are nothing short of dull and boring. The standout songs are the acoustic and soft rock songs. While I prefer the harder sound anyday, these guys aren't good at it and they just don't deliver the goods. 4, 10, and 12 are alright songs with 12 being the hardest with an Alice In Chains kinda grunge sound. Other than that the cd is boring. Overall, It's a slightly below average cd with a few decent songs that I'll be ripping onto my comp and then selling the cd. You might check it out if you're really desperate for new music but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Massive but messy,"I ordered this book because it looked encyclopedic and I hoped I could get by with a single reference work on Illustrator. While this book has a lot of information and is useful, I wouldn't recommend it if it's the only or the first book you're going to get. This volume is rather thin in terms of useful graphics and illustrations, ironically for a book on how to use a program called ""Illustrator."" It is not tightly edited. In using it I have encountered numerous glitches: instances where the software doesn't look or behave quite as described, concepts and terms are used that have not been previously defined or explained, figures are mis-identified in the text, tools and techniques are recommended without a clear explanation of how to find them in the menus, etc etc."
3,It should have been the Bible but...,"I help teach Illustrator at a local college and I thought I would buy the Illustrator CS Bible because Adobe really updated alot of things in Illustrator CS. To my amazement, there are things in the Illustrator's Bible that fall short. For example, text on a circular path has changed, when you center the text, the new text engine pushes the text (it does center the text) about 180 degrees--something which is not mentioned in the Bible. That and a few other things and typos all make this book a serious consideration for future Illustrator Bible purchases. I know that teachers often tell students to buy Bible books to have, at the minimum, a reference to the program. And for that purpose, the Illustrator Bible does an adequate job. However, for those that are coming from Illustrator 10 (or prior) and want to learn Illustrator CS--I would perhaps go to other sources to learn what Illustrator CS has to offer."
3,THE FIRST CARRY ON TO BE MADE IN COLOUR,"Fun and games aboard a Mediterranean cruise liner with the group of passengers and crew members under the command of the strict, no nonsense Captain Crowther (marvelously played by SID JAMES). This was the first entry in the series to be made in colour. There are many laughs along the way although is slightly handicapped by the absence of most of the regulars. Only SID JAMES, KENNETH WILLIAMS and KENNETH CONNOR, the series ""official"" regulars are present. DILYS LAYE takes on a part origanally written for JOAN SIMS (who was unable to take the part due to illness). LIZ FRAZER (who appeared in many of the early entries) and ESMA CANNON are also on view as well as LANCE PERCIVAL as a hopelessly sea sick chef. On the whole though a good comedy, defintley worth a look."
4,Good Replacement,The switch was easy to replace. All of the wires and connections were the same. The switch arm is slightly longer thant the original. This required some adjustment of the float assembly. The product is working great.
2,Minicraft Boeing B-29 Superfortress,"This is one of the 30 year old Crown molds, and as such it is basic, but it's the only 1/144 B-29 in town.Detail is generaly good if you're not too concerned about accuracy. However, there are some parts that need replacement or refining (good luck!!) Main areas are the wheels, which are totally inaccurate, and the landing gear needs to be thinned down. There are no exhaust channels on the engines,the engine openings themselves will need refining, and the tail shape is a little suspect. Scribed panel lines are at a minimum. There is no cockpit to speak of, and if you use the landing gear, you will need to put weights in the nose (to be extra sure, I put weights in the engines as well.)Overall, not a bad kit, but in bad need of after-market resin parts."
4,Perfect for class project,This was a quick & easy model to be built by a 10 year old & her father for a history project. Only negative were the decals that did not peel off easily.
3,I want to like it....,"If I could have looked at this bag in a store for two minutes I would have known not to buy it. I like everything about this bag except opening the camera compartment. I have the Rover AW II, which is very similar to this bag, so I knew you couldn't get to the camera gear fast, but this bag makes it even more awkward because of the laptop compartment. I wish they would put a zippered flap on the side of the bag for quick access to the camera like on the Lowepro Fastpack or Tamrac Aero Speed Pack.This bag looks nice and seems to be well made, I really want to keep it, but because it is so difficult to access the camera gear I am going to return it to Amazon."
3,"This is a decent BIG bag, but...","Yes, this is a decent big bag, but in use it's just awkward. The lower portion, when fully loaded with my equipment, is difficult to open, close and just plain operate. As I am now searching for another bag, I realize I need to see the bag in person before purchasing it."
3,"Super good for cameras, not so good for anything else","If you are a serious/professional photographer, you will love this backpack.If, like me, you are a hobbyist, it's probably more than you need.Good aspects:Super well built. Excellent construction and design.Very comfortable, even with a heavy load.Excellent protection for camera equipment.Bad aspects:Not nearly enough room for non-camera stuff.A few pockets are hard to find, and some zippers are very hard to pull because of the protective flaps that keep rain out.So, if you are a professional photographer trekking in Nepal, this is the bag you want.If you are a camera buff who wants to carry his camera body, two lenses and a bunch of non-camera stuff on a daily basis, this is not the bag you want.Last thought: If you live in a concealed carry state, the pocket at the bottom for the rain cover is well hidden and could hold a compact body fire arm. It's the perfect angle for a quick grab while wearing the bag."
5,My daughter loves it!,"I bought this toy for my daughter on her 1st birthday and now she is 2, and she loves this toy so much. It's one of the best spanish speaking toys I've come across for this age. She plays with it constantly and it teaches colors, shapes, and sings. Really worth it!"
3,Learn Spanish First,"Nice Toy. But before buying it you need to appoint a spanish teacher for some basic Spanish classes. Anyway infants are not worried about the language, they dont care even if it is Greek!!"
5,SATISFIED FIRST TIME BUYER,"I purchased the LeapFrog Baby Croki for my son who is mentally challenged and non verbal. This toy has lasted a year long with many thumps, falls, sqeezed from all ends where all you feel is the cloth and not the buttons on the hands or feet. I forgot to mention that this is the 3rd LeapFrog Baby Croki that my sons goes through and they are extremely durable. The other Croki's lasted a year and my son has had this other one for 3 months now. I have never been so pleased with the a product that was so well made and the user friendly shopping experience I had with Amazon.com. I would recommend anyone to look for items on Amazon and purchse their gifts. I can gaurantee all buyers will be pleased!! Thank you again Amazon for my easy purchase and quick delivery. Sara Paredez, N.B, TEXAS"
4,Spanish Baby Tad,I paid $6 for the Spanish Tad and our grandson loves him. He likes the lights and the big eyes. I like the songs and the price.
1,Wow!,"I can't believe how bad this is. It's another Godspell production...Yo. Seriously. This is the end. If this is what the ""hip"" crowd is throwing at me now, it's the end like hair metal.This is so bad.It sounds so light and airy and the catchyness is so fake.These guys are a bunch of dorks. If you have any respect for music or life in general avoid this album. We will collectively be laughing at this kind of music in the very near future. Jump ship now!This is high frutose cornsyrup that leaves you feeling mad ill.We are spoiled as a cluture. and the end will hopefully soon come soon.This is ridiculous...Please.Stop the hurt.Who listens to this stuff...The kids must be getting younger and younger who are running things.Just out of college. Doing it.Worst album of the year."
5,buy this,"that's pretty much all i have to say. if you like smashing pumpkins, rem, placebo our lady peace idlewild etc, then you will love this. highly reccomended"
4,"Abandoned Pools ""Humanistic"" Review","The entire ""Humanistic"" CD is excellent. There is not a track on it that isn't superb, in my opinion. I highly recommend it to anyone."
3,Well-Behaved Offspring of Smashing Pumpkins and NIN,"Former Eels multi-instrumentalist Tommy Walters returns under the nom de plume Abandoned Pools. This is a point of fact only since his debut, Humanistic, is less like the monomaniacal depression of Eels front man E as it is the well- behaved offspring of Smashing Pumpkins and Nine Inch Nails. That's a compliment. What keeps me from listening to NIN, and flat out loathing Smashing Pumpkins, is a delusional paranoia that got worse with stardom. AP gets crunchy without the world-ending drama. It also helps that Walters cuts his whine with tunefulness, and that he shares E's gift for good old-fashioned hooks, not to mention the occasional joke. Pop music, what a concept!"
2,"Great music, bad CD","The music on this CD is great, of course that depends on what type of music you like. Why would I give it 2 stars you ask? That's because this music CD has Macromedia(I think), 'copy protection' on it. It prevents you from listening to this cd in your computer. It prevents you from LEGALLY (fair use laws) making a backup for your own purposes. Want to legally convert this cd into mp3's to listen to on your personal audio device? Too bad."
2,"cool at first, then rather boring","the first was good, but the cd gets worse and worse the more you listen to it, it gets kind of boring and lame. now i know why my friends made fun of me for buying this cd"
1,Abondoned Poop!,"I got the sampler from the website. If the title ""Humanistic"" isn't enough of a tip off, let me help you: Pretentious amature drivel.This guy was in the Eels?"
5,If you like Siamese Dream,"If you like the Smashing Pumpkins, Siamese Dream, you will love this one. Saw them open for Garbage live and went straight out to buy the CD. A great mix of pop and rock, slow and fast."
5,Humanistic,"This CD is the best album I've heard in a long time. It conveys so many different emotions, and the lyrics are not only amazing, but also fun. Within minutes you'll find yourself singing along with the catchy choruses and trying to duet with Tommy's intense vocals. From the beginning to the end, this CD will keep on surprising you. If you are a big fan of alternative rock music, or just want to try something new, get yourself a copy of Humanistic...you won't be disappointed!"
5,Fantastic Four!!!!,"This band is amazing! Their sound is amazing, totally unique to any other band I've heard...but it has this certain familiarity that makes u want to sing along. Definitly one of my favorite cds! It's also one of those cds that you can listen to the whole thing through without skipping a single song, which isnt that common these days. Without any stereotyical label, thsi band is most definitly the coolest! And this Album is definitly only a little spark of what they have to hold for the future!"
4,One of the best cds i have ever heard,The Remedy is my favorite song. tommy walter is awsome he's an awsome singer!! Leah is HOTT!!! in the vid for the song.Mercy kiss is a good song. tommy isnt as good on this song as The Remedy but he is till awsome. Leah is awsome on the bass.those are my two favorites on the cd and the rest of the songs are cool but im to lazy to write about them
4,"Excellent Music, Promising Artist, Obscure Lyrics","I have looked forward to buying Humanistic for nearly six years (when I heard their music on the TV series Clone High), and was not disappointed in the least with Abandoned Pools' first album.Tommy Walter's music is solid, diverse, and unique. Even if the lyrics of Humanistic often leave me scratching my head wondering what he was talking about, the fantastically beautiful melodies and rich soundscapes he weaves more than make up for the confusion. Each song is distinct, but Humanistic feels cohesive despite the multiple styles that Walter explores.I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Abandoned Pools also has a new EP and album (at least, new to me), as well as a tenth anniversary demo version of the Humanistic songs. Now I know what to add to my collection next!"
5,awsome,i won this cd as a prize at a premiere along with some other rap album but i loved this album ihave it on my mp3 player at least two times betwwen other songs...buy this awsome cd now
4,Great!,I bought this CD after falling in love with Start Over. I do not regret this purchase. I listen to this CD all the time. It's unique and refreshing to listen to if you are sick of pop-crap.
4,Return of Intelligent Rock,"Abandoned Pools, the band who brings you the song I KNOW you've heard -- Remedy -- delivers a truly powerful album with ""Humanistic."" Aptly titled, the album delves into various aspects of the human condition -- love, love lost, guilt, etc. -- with catchy riffs and starling harmonies. Perhaps best, though, is the lyrics. An intelligence exists beneath them unparalleled in recent rock. Praise for Abandoned Pools, who cut through the awful din of recent music and found a home in my CD player for the last month!"
4,humanistic,An overall great piece of music. I've seen them once and the energy of the show is right there on the disc.
4,Abandoning the Mainstream,"Tommy Walter made an amazing debut with the album Humanistic. With a splash of techno, a lot of rock, and a lot of soul, this album pounds out 12 tracks of power and emotional lyrics. I first saw the band live with Flickerstick in Columbus and was blown away by the compelling tone/distortion shifts, and powerful lyrics. The albums somber mood is covered with fierce guitars and techno beats. It's the most innovative and honest album of the year."
5,"don't pass ""humanistic"" by!","abandoned pools's album, ""humanistic"" is a stunning album full of amazing riffs, beats and rhythms. not to mention the superb lyrics by frontman tommy walters. abandoned pools's debut album comes with its share of awesome and inspiring songs such as ""the remedy"", ""mercy kiss"" and ""suburban muse"" along with a number of other great rocking songs.i thoroughly enjoyed this album and its been on heavy rotation in my cd player ever since. abandoned pools have been compared to other musical greats such as the smashing pumpkins. and they are definetly ranking up there with them. the music is mezmerizing and the lyrics are unforgettable.i discovered abandoned pools as i was listening to the radio, something i do everyday. i first heard their song ""the rememdy"" and was taken away by the stellar lyrics and amazing sound. in the next few days i went out and bought the album and became an instant abandoned pools fan.this album is one not to be passed by."
5,A fresh sound...,"I first got to hear Abandoned Pools at HFStival 2002 on the street stage, and I loved their performance so much that I figured I'd check out the CD. What a great decision! Abandoned Pools has a great sound, just perfect for driving or hanging out either with friends or by yourself around the house. I absolutely love it!"
5,Great Album,"Great album from beginning to end. Consistently great songs from Remedy to Blood to Flourescein. The only song I tend to skip is ""Never"" mainly because it seems to kind of lag in comparison to the rest of the cd. Probably my favorite purchase in the last year!!"
5,Every Song is Great - No Filler,"How many albums produced these days can say that every song on it is great? Well, this one can. All the songs are well-crafted and produced perfectly.Tommy Walters is one of the greatest talents in rock today. All the comparisons to Smashing Pumpkins is totally pre-mature. If you listen to this entire album, you realize that Abandoned Pools can't be pigeon-holed into a particular style or influence. He has a great knack for going in different directions without sounding contrived. I wouldn't be surpised if the next album sounds totally different.They're also great to see live. If you didn't catch them opening for Garbage, you can see them this summer with Lenny Kravtiz - okay, you can leave before Lenny goes on.And one tidbit - Josh Frese from A Perfect Circle plays on this album. That should be enough at least to give it listen."
5,Amazing New Album,"Humanistic is a solid effort. I have been following the press on-line about Abandoned Pools and was excited to get the album the first day it came out. Tommy Walter plays everything but the drums on this record and it sounds like a...rock band that has been around for years. It is an enjoyable, diverse album that doesn't stand on the merits of one or two ""hit"" songs made for radio, but a body of work that is quite astounding for someone's first effort on their own.Not to get negative, but the person who wrote a review here on Amazon after hearing a Sampler of the ALBUM when there is likely two or three songs on it. What a joke! At least listen to the entire record before you jump on-line and make a negative comment about something. Do you research or don't bother as it is a disservice to real fans who want to know about good new music."
5,Digital camera's best friend. Easy USB and software.,"I really enjoy the USB CameraMate that comes with the MicroDrive. The software simply views the CameraMate as a physical drive accessible by Windows, so you can drag and drop files easily.The volume of the MicroDrive is simply amazing and I highly recommend it over the CompactFlash counterparts."
3,Its a Crock,"Its one of those deals where you say you get what you pay for, its OK thats about it,its not soft leather."
1,Wrong color,"It is very light brown - looks like a lady color - that is the trouble with ""Made in China"" - Amazon needs to get tough with these misleading product representation causing waste of time."
3,"Looks good, has flaws","The main bands look good and have held up relatively well after about six months, but I can't say the same of the too-thin loops that hold them. Those started fraying and losing their surface coloration almost immediately."
3,British garage rock,"The Troggs were a British garage rock back that also had its fair share of bubblegum tunes and ballads. Of course, they're best known for their garage rock anthem ""Wild Thing"" which knocked Tommy James' ""Hanky Panky"" off the top of the Billboard Top 40 chart. It was written by an American, Chip Taylor who also had a huge hit with ""Angel of the Morning.""The Troggs also had one other huge hit, the ballad ""Love Is All Around"" which peaked at #2. I've heard this song a million times but I never realized it was them. The rest of this 11 song collection is a mixed bag with the strongest cuts being the very catchy ""With A Girl Like You"", ""I Want You"" which sounds like ""Wild Thing"" meets ""Louie Louie"" and ""I Can't Control Myself"". This song was banned on many American radio stations as being too orgasmic. You mustn't ever be too orgasmic."
1,You can't go back,"Truly awful. If you listen carefully, you realize that these guys knew exactly four chords and used them faithfully. Actually, that is remarkable in itself, in a way.Bought this in a fit of nostalgia. As Peter DeVries said, ""Nostalgia ain't what it used to be."" And this proves it.Buy something new. You'll play this once, and never again. It is a CD that is bound for Goodwill, since it's probable no one would buy it at the yard sale."
2,troggs not that good(cheap cheesy band!),the troggs arent that good of a band they only have really 2 good songs wild thing really only good song. dont buy troggs just download it off limewire really im not spendin 10 freiken bucks on it barely good dont buy not good download them off limewire please dont buy the troggs download of limewire for them!
2,no language aids,"I hoped there would be at least a few phrases in the Thai language or place names in Thai to help in our 3 day lay over in Bangkok - but no. There is nothing special about this. It is nice to have a map, but again it is all in English."
1,"Works okay, but already broke 1 selector (fortunately not using it)","I bought this to combine 3 Component video sources into 1 port on my HDTV/Tuner, and also to combine multiple composite videos sources. (Un)Fortunately, I do not use the composite inputs, since 1 in on the front and I don't want to have cables in the front of my equipment rack. So far the viseo quality of the 3 component video inputs are acceptable, but 1 of the selector buttons has broken (will not stay IN). Fortunately here it is input #4 (composite) and the 3 component are still working. Will need to look for replacement if another button decides to fail.12/2010 update. All but 1 input has now failed and the unit has been replaced by a powered unit (Nyrius SW201)"
3,Works great but...,Just be aware that you need to plug in two different kinds of connections (composite and component) for all of the inputs to work. Otherwise it works just fine.
3,It Works...,"When I got this I was confused, because about half of this product doesn't even work. I'm not sure if they're all like that or what, but luckily it works for what I need it for. I'm not disappointed, but I would not suggest this if you actually NEED to use it's maximum capacity right away. Also, I think it messed up the sound quality of my TV."
4,I whupped batmans arse,"I bought the dvd figuring ""what could be funnier the a fat schizophrenic?"" boy was I wrong, it's not very funny at all. In fact it's quite serious, there are moments that are very funny but Wesley Willis was quite smart and thoughtful. it is like bevis and butthead remaking the movie rainman."
5,scared i'll never aquire my own copy of this book,"Vogel's vignettes of overcoming fear create my favorite book for young children who are afraid of night noises and dark shadows. Rhyming scenarios of two children meeting the frighting likes of ghosts and tigers playfully provide young readers/listeners alternative reactions to unsettling suprises.As a children's librian I read this book to hundreds of preschoolers who responded enthusiastically to the mantra repeated throughout the book ""Don't be scared!"". The format and humor provide a light hearted approach to an emotion with which many children (and parents) grapple.Sadly, hundreds of miles away from the library at which i worked, i am unable to purchase Vogel's ""Don't Be Scared Book"" to give new parents or to keep in my own library. Please, Publishers! Please bring this book back into print! I'll buy at least 20 copies if you do . . ."
1,Some editions remove half the pages!,"""I Can Fly"" is a wonderful book. We purchased the board book edition after reading the hardcover from our library. We were very disappointed that two editions, at 24 pages, are quietly missing half the pages of the 48 page hardcover edition. The missing animals are ""I can grab like a crab"", ""Who can walk like a bug? Me Ug ug"", ""Pick pick pick I'm a little chick"", ""Who can live in a hole? Me! Like a mole"", ""Who can climb anywhere? Me! Like a bear."", ""Bump bump bump I'm a camel with a hump"", ""Haw haw haw I'm a donkey in the straw"", ""Howl howl howl I'm an old screech owl"". You're missing out on half the fun here!"
1,This book can't fly!,This publisher has made huge mistake by removing half of the pages from the original. Big disappointment!! Hope the original version will be republished soon.
1,This is an abridged version,"I was disappointed when this book arrived. When I was young I had an edition from the 1960's - this is not it! Text from the 1960's version is referenced in the editorial review which does not appear in this book (both the goat and the crab do not appear, among others).Don't assume that the same title and publisher means it's the same book. And, unlike I did, read all the reviews before you buy (some else has already made this discovery)."
2,Should have read the customer reviews,"Crunch, crunch, crunch, editors had the book for lunch. I was so happy to find this book, I didn't scroll down and read the customer reviews. Wish I had, because I was very disappointed to find it abridged. Its not that long a book to begin with, so who would think pages would be left out? Only reason could be to keep the cost of the book down. I would have been happy to pay more to have the whole book."
5,I Can Fly,"I am 53 years old and my parents read this book to me. I loved it and always asked for this one to be read to me over & over. I was just about 3 yrs. old and had heard the story so many times, I could say it word for word by memory. During the years while moving, the book was lost. I always wondered what happened to my book. In 1975, after I had children I wrote a letter to Golden Books to see if I could get a copy, but they couldn't help me. About 6 yrs. ago, my sister-in-law was at a flea market and found a copy for me. I now read it to my grand daughter. I still enjoy the book, and love the illustrations."
4,Great Gift Idea,"As an artist I would purchase this book for reference, but I got it as a gift for my friend's little niece that reminds me of the one illustrated here. Of'course I had to take a peek at the work, and Mary Blair is always timeless and her artwork here is a great example of her non-Disney material. The only criticism I have is of the construction* of the book, I guess in today's market the price I paid for a mid century reprint somewhat justifies its quality. However, I would have given 5 stars had it not been for this.*I feel that proper care is required. I can already see the gold outer binding falling apart in the near future, and the pages were not aligned with the front and back hardcover and protruding out."
1,Yuck!,"I am in an AP European history class right now, and this book is the textbook some genius has chosen for us to use. I have found that the entire thing is written in an extremely convoluted and confusing manner, to the point where after reading any given chapter I have had to either consult The Cliff's Euro History book or the online study guide to actually get the point. While reading the Cliffs book it also become evident to me that they have left out a fair number of important events and characters. All in all, I would not recommend this book to anyone looking to learn a straightforward history of Europe."
1,not even a textbook,"Most textbooks are designed to teach and instruct in a detailed and straight forward manner. This book is unable to do either. The language it is written in is very confusing, it seems that most of the book is written as an essay, using big fancy words which are totally unnecessary. The message is not easy to discern. The book does not provide good instruction. In fact, THERE IS NOT EVEN A GLOSSARY, and most of the words aren't even defined in context.This is pathetic, I will have to buy another supplement in hopes of doing well on the AP exam, because this book will be unable to get me prepared. Instructors, please stay away from this book. Students, good luck trying to understand it."
3,An Excruciating Read!!,"Although wordy with ALOT of jumping around, this book does manage to make some very good points regarding the modern economy and where its going.As an ""elective book"" for my MBA, I found it to be a bit over-the-top for an ""introductory"" book, however, I admit that my own shortcomings in the area of Econ. may account for this.Hope that helps - Regards"
2,CUT VERSION,DON T READ THIS A CUT VERSIONTHERE IS NO UNCUT DVD FOR THE MOMENT EXCEPT IN VHSSO DON T BUY IT
4,I LOVE THIS MOVIE BUT WHERE IS SHE??,THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST FOR THE FANS OF PRISONS MOVIE BUE I WOULD LIKE AN INTEGRAL VERSION SO WHEN IT WILL BE AVAILABLE????I DON'T KNOW BUT I TELL YOU IT IS A VERY GOOD AND VIOLENT MOVIE WITH RAPES NUDITY VIOLENCE EVERYTHING GOOD
3,Traditional And I mean TRADITIONAL Xmas Music,"If you love Ragtime, and not just piano versions of the classic format, but full orchestras, you will enjoy Paragon Ragtime's Christmas album. It very successfully captures that turn-of-the-century feel with music that straddles the fence between out and out classical music and ragtime, which was battling for mainstream acceptance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. So if sopranoes singing non-secular music is not your thing, you may want to skip a few tracks. Some tunes are long lost traditionals that will help complete your rare christmas music collection if that is your inclination."
3,Opera and Ragtime,"This CD falls somewhere between opera and rag time. I love rag time and I love some opera...what I wasn't expecting was the opera part. It is nice to hear something different that you aren't hearing constantly on holiday radio stations, but don't expect this to be an instrummental album."
1,WORST DVD EVER,"This is the worst thing I've ever seen.Even worse than Robotech!The ""anime episodes"" are poorly voice acted and have an even worse storyline!I am ashamed to say I even bought this piece of junk.Then the ""concept"" was just some guy blabbing on,and on, and on.No helpful information just a waste of time and money."
5,Classic!,"If you like Inuyasha, and you like classic orchestral music... you will love this combination. Not from the OVAS or the series, a diferent variation, mature, serious, not for the kid-like fan. This could be the soundtrack from the greatest Inuyasha animated motion picture ever made!. You only need to add the movie... # 5 maybe?"
3,Coming of Age With Elephants: A Memoir,A lot of book is research and boring details. You learn stuff about elephants but not in the most exciting way.Its alright but not a book I rushed to get back to. Buy it if you want research details and daily stuff..this book is for you. I hoped it would be more exciting to read. It is what it is. Informative though.
4,Led Astray and That's OK...,"With gift certificate in hand, I scrolled through the Editor's choices of ""Hot"" cds. I quickly spotted a review titled ""Cure and Talking Heads Had a Baby"" and curiousity got the best of me. I played a snippet...it sounded good on my sub-par speakers...and a purchase was made. Funny thing is, after I listened to the entire cd, I personally didn't hear alot of either band in there...music is tricky like that...but it STILL rocked! *I* heard some super-strong Pixie-esque bass lines (check out track 2) and drums which, at times, conjured up visions of Big Country or Slade. I would agree that the singer does have some David Byrne-esque qualities but he also reminded me a bit of the vocalist from the Toadies. Anyway, this was one of those on-a-whim musical purchases that turned out to be a supa supa find."
4,80's Retro?,"If there is an 80's retro wave coming these guys will be at the crest. I hear tinges of the Stranglers, The Damned, and David Byrne here. Nice."
3,NYC rockers debut release...,"I first heard of this band when I watched the video for ""My Coco"" on MTV2's Subterranean. It was so catchy that I had to go out and buy it. Without getting in depth into the band's music, this indeed is 80's retro music (new-wave, very early alt-rock). Yes, I do hear Talking Heads and The Cure, but I also hear Big Country and XTC (the lead singer's voice is reminiscent of those of the lead singers of the latter two bands IMHO). In any case, their self-titled debut isn't all that bad. Definitely good!"
1,These guys are lame,"These guys suck. Sounds like everything else. Also, the drummer puts electrical tape over his tits which makes them worse. Thanks but no thanks."
1,Passionate? Powerful?,"Do any of you people hear the lyrics? Are you blind to what this band is about? This band is the Backstreet Boys of the NYC hipster scene. They're younger, better looking, and more importantly, less challenging than virtually any band in the scene. Prepackaged for Carson Daly. One dimensional. This band was designed to be signed by a major label and marketed in magazines and on TV. Not suprisingly, their fans are the most shallow and least sophisticated of all the NY bands. There's no DEPTH here people, this is contrived fluff. My intial response to ""My Coco"" was, ""oh, I guess that's kind of catchy"" By the end of the second listen, I was saying ""this is garbage. There's nothing HERE!!"""
2,These guys are compared to WHO???,"I saw these guys open for Devo and was unimpressed. Then I picked up their album for 3.99 (Japanese bonus track included) at a used store downtown to give em another try.I admit, my first impression with these fools was this: only David Byrne can get away with being David Byrne, that female bass-player is a much better bass-player than a singer (thats not saying much), and the guitar player has a face I'd like to punch. Mind you, I'm a very peaceful guy, and I still would like to punch him in the face.REGARDLESS, this CD is garbage. To compare this to my favorite band XTC truly boggles my mind. Perhaps because the vocalist has no inhibitions about babbling nonsense and barking? This band is really just castrated guitar-pop with a little feedback and no talent. Vocalist dude, you're not David Byrne. Shut up.If you want to listen to some white kids from NYC playing echoey guitars, listen to Interpol. They're not insipid."
5,Better than expected,"Stellastar is a lovechild between The Talking Heads, The Pixies, and Robert Smith. Take David Byrne of the Talking Heads, let him hook up with the Pixies, and let Robert Smith of the Cure help with the songwriting, and you get something like Stellastarr. The guitarwork on 'Jenny' is especially Pixiesesque, and the album on the whole is really good; an enjoyable listen. This stuff could be too 80'sish for some, but I like what I hear. Pretty damn good."
4,A debut that deserves more notice than they've gotten,"Stellastarr*'s debut album is intoxicatingly catchy, full of lush, rocking pop tunes, charming lyrics (e.g., ""come on down to my place, there's a swimming pool, and it's winning over everybody!), and a sound that screams of their 80s influences. It's true--the sound on their self-titled CD is not particularly original--it is slathered in references to the Pixies, Talking Heads, the Cure, Devo, etc. The Pixies and Talking Heads influences seem most pronounced to me, though others have dwelled on Christensen's vocal similarities to Robert Smith; (The female background vocals on 'Jenny' during the chorus sound EXACTLY like Kim Deal's on 'Debaser.')But though the sound is largely derivative, they do manage to give each song a feel all of their own.I saw them open for the Raveonettes in Chicago last summer and strongly recommend taking in their live performances."
1,One and done...,"Upon hearing ""In the Walls"" on a DVD sampler, I though this amazing track would be accompanied by several more.Boy was I wrong! This band is directionless. Instead of simply taking from their influences like an Interpol, they just throw theirs into a blender and get this...Please listen to the samples before you but this."
1,Stellasuckk*,"I'm sorry but this music is absolutely absurd. I know that everyone's buying into this ""stonewashed denim and Duran Duran are retroactively great"" sound at the moment, but for my $10 I'll take the Interpol- a New York band that knows how to use the past and arguably improve upon it in tasteful and original ways. Oh yeah, and that's a band that has a degree of irony about themselves. I'm sure stellastarr(insert silly asterisk here) will sell plenty of records after they're crammed down teenagers throats on TRL, but the songs are trite and uninspired and their ""hip 80's sound"" is about 18 months from being dated for the second time. Lets see how they like it when 20 years down the road some band comes along to try and improve upon them; not a daunting task."
1,Looks like some of their friends are trying to help them out,"...or some hacks from their record company. 5 star reviews? Are you people kidding me? This band is terrible. ""Which way to go GO GO GO !!!""If you give something a positive review after hearing that cr*p, you need your head examined.Stellastarr- are a bunch of posers riding the retro new wave...and not fooling anyone who has a semblance of discriminating taste."
1,The 80's are gone the music should be too!,"Why is everybody so woozy and wishing for 80's music. Pastel clothes, cartoon haircuts, and cocaine are passe. At least that's what my Dad tells me when I visit him in prison. You folks should get over your bad selves and move on with your lives. Listen to something that's new and fresh not old and done too many times before. Heck I like the theme song to Fairly Odd Parents better than this stuff."
2,gosip,"hey all,after just finishing reading this book i must say it was very dispointing. Alot of it was guess work and it repeated itself over and over. With regard to Fred and Rose I have to say that even if half of what is said in the book is true, they are two very sick people."
5,Great PKI Project Manager's Guide/tutorial/overview,"I gave this five stars for the breadth of coverage. I don't need yet another book on cryptography -- I already have a shelf full. Carlisle and Steve cover the PKI turf without getting unnecessarily bogged down in technical details. For example, they cover the functions and differences of ECDSA versus ECDH in about a paragraph. If you want to know how the algorithms work, read Applied Cryptography. This has a clear, concise, and non-technical explanation of just about every concept, standard, and issue a project manager would need to know about PKI. I give credit for not trying to cover the technical issues in depth -- rather, this takes the approach of: here's the issue, here are the alternatives, and if you want to know more read ...The concepts and issues are very current, and cover proposed and draft standards, including Privilege Management Infrastructure, certificate revocation mechanisms, trust models, etc. Excellent coverage!"
3,Has value for Technical Architects / Security Analysts,"I think there's some merit to people expecting a more hands on approach in a book like this. But those expectations seems unrealistic. The book is not titled ""Implementing PKI,"" it's called ""Understanding PKI.""There is value in a concepts book. For experienced technical professional trying to get a grip on the terminologies and concepts of security and PKI, this book is succinct and touches all the major points.For those looking for screenshots of people right clicking icons, there's a thousand other books like that! Most of those so called ""technical books"" are not that technical. It's nice to have a book that's not product specific for a change.This book does what it intends to do well. There is a need for more technical books but this book is valuable in it's present form. I have given several copies to peers.I hope this review helps you balance out your opinions before deciding for or against this book."
5,Complete and succinct discussion of PKI,"""Understanding Public-Key Infrastructure"" is well written and is a terrific book. It is the most complete and succinct book available on the subject of PKI. Other books deal with various detailed aspects of Public-Key Infrastructure, but this particular book is the best available in forming a clear overall perspective of the subject area. A great book for managers or technical readers which are looking for good, solid information but which don't want excessive details. I enjoyed the book, and feel the authors did an excellent job in describing the subject of PKI. The approach taken in this book is useful, not hyped. The coverage is broad and extensive but not encumbered by inordinate detail about algorithms and protocols. Explanations are clear and concise.I am pleased to recommend the book to anyone looking for a very good, succinct but thorough treatment of the subject area."
1,Nearly worthless,"I bought this book because of the excellent reviews it got. However upon reading this I can't see any justification for these reviews. First of all it is very high level; I mean appropriate for your manager's, manager's manager maybe. This book is all about fawning over Diffie Hellman and philosophizing about how pki should be used etc. There is no technical information in this book, no code, no flow charts, no diagrams, no data structures. It doesn't even explain how pki is applied, for example to ssl. All the real information in this book could have been condenced to a few pages. I really needed this book to be good and it was not. Look if you want to go to a cocktail party and impress someone with no technical exposure then maybe this is your book. Otherwise there must be better choices."
4,"it is not bad, but somewhat shallow","I would like to see more details, but otherwise - it is very nice introductory book."
3,"A softer, gentler Mohawk","I was thrilled when I heard this figure was coming out, but when I saw it I was disappointed. The figure is great, the paint job fine, but the face is so serene. Since when was Mohawk the zen master? His face is calm and gentle, a soft smile gracing his lips.Mohawk was mean, this sculpt should have had teeth or a sneer!Whatever, if you don't care, it's still a great figure."
5,warm sleeping bag,"This is a warm sleeping bag, and there is no sweating because of the fill, it can be a double bag and has a strong heavy outer shell, and is big enough to turn easily,"
5,great buy for big guy,"This product is well worth it. I go camping a lot. There's plenty of room which I love. I'm 6'2"" 265lbs so if your big get this bag...I slept great and was nice and warm. Bigger than I expected."
3,NOT THE BEST,A book that had potential--but missed the mark. There are a few jems inside but over all there are much better compilations out there...so just skip this one.
2,Maudlin,"This book has a few good quotes, but alot of junk too. The Christian stuff is mostly mushy pulp, and the selections from Buddha are pretty superficial compared to the rest of what he supposedly said. There are a few good talks from Zen Masters, but only a few. I wouldn't recommend it. The wisdom in this book doesn't compare to other books of a similar nature, and you can probably pick this one up at a used book store dirt cheap. If you do find it there, though, save it for someone who is a near hopeless materialist. It might help them out abit. Other than that, save your money and buy a copy of the Tao Teh Ching, or Kahl Gibran or a book of pithy quotes."
1,Unfair to the Holy Spirit,"This book was supposed to give a fair hearing to each side and have a fair editor. But the editor, Grudem, is himself an engaged third wave charismatic who has written books defending charismatic heresies born this century. So he was not fitted for the job. And indeed he choose modern and fit advocates of charismatism, whereas for the adverse view he took an old, retired man (Gaffin, who is not editor, there is a mistake in the data from Amazon) who wrote a book on the issue a few decades ago, without cogent argumentation.. Gaffin is not up to date for the debate and is no match for the others. If Grudem had been truly ""filled/led by the Spirit"" he would have chosen someone who recently and cogently argued for the conservative, traditional Christian view, such as Thomas Edgar, Norman Geisler, Robert L. Thomas, etc. But then the charismatics would have lost, and this is the last thing he wanted on his charismatic agenda"
4,Thoughtful engagement of the issues; courteous in tone,"I took a Theology course (Eschatology and Ecclesiology) with Dr. Grudem, and when I saw this book was required, I was happy. The contributors are very able yet treat each other with respect. Read the Introduction by Grudem; it sets the stage by refusing to entertain ideas that all of the participants identified as unbiblical and destructive (""health and wealth"" etc.). Saucy (""Open But Cautious"") and Storms (Third Wave) present the most compelling arguments, but Oss and Gaffin are very able, too."
2,Obviously not a complete look,"This can in no way be a real look at such a sensitive and talented man. All we see is a drunk, rambling for the most part. I can't believe that this is his state from sun up to sundown How could he write such beautiful songs pissed out of his mind round the clock. It seems that this is a film focused on one aspect of a talented man's life."
2,Sometimes warts and all is still full of warts,"If the director thought conducting every interview with MacGowan while he was drunk revelatory she was wrong. The ad made this seem an honest look at a star and his vices and just proved to be an attempt at character resurection. Yes we saw Shane out of it, (constantly) but no real details of either the band history or MacGowan's lifelong struggles. It seemd to me a way of admitting to lesser sins to claim innocence of greater ones. That and being a ""Yank"" the language (especially Shane's) is for the most part hard to follow. That and the way the movie ends( shot in 2002) gives a certain high sense of irony to the current Pogue reunion tour."
4,"""tres curieux""","""Though Mr. Newton is no physicist, his book is very interesting."" -- Father Nicolas Malebranche (1707)"
5,Great Condition,"For the price, I was very pleased to find this book in such great quality. I am so thankful I was able to find it as simply and easily, and it arrived well-prepared. (a thank you note and care felt around the book!)Thank you!"
4,Optiks came on time and in perfectly usable condition,It was worth the price. I would definitely recommend it to the old school physics lovers. I have this on kindle but wanted to gift it to my physicist father.
4,Opticks Reviewed,Overall the book covered the material well. However the book was somewhat difficult to follow. It took a couple of passes to clarify what was being said.
5,Excellent,"My parents bought and use this printer. It outperforms the comparable HP's in all tasks. The print speed is blistering fast for B&W and still very fast for color. The other review about the status of a return is just idiotic. It has nothing to do with reviewing the product. Anyways, I'm thinking about buying one for myself. It works amazing."
4,so far so good.,"This is a good printer for the price. I have only had it for a couple of months and use it for school work. The print quality is good, it's fast, has been reliable and easy to use. I would recommend it for someone that needs to print/copy/scan a couple of times a week."
2,To My Sons by Harold Bell Wright,"The information in the book is very interesting, assuming you have an interest in Harold Bell Wright, as I do. BUT the edition is very strange. There is absolutely no indication of who the publisher is. On the end page it says it was printed in the USA...that's all. I have to wonder if the Wright family knows about this as they DO protect their copyright AND this book is not yet in the public domain. It seems for all the world like some kind of pirated knock off of a book which is otherwise fairly rare. True first editions, if you can find one, sell for around $1,000.00. Or you can purchase a modern reproduction by The Yestermorrow Press % the Barbara Berry Bookshop for about $165.00, new. This modern, limited edition was authorized by the Wright family. Another concern I have with this edition is the quality of the type is compromised, like it was printed from old, shabby plates. It's good to have it available for only $40.00 but is sure seems ""fishy"" to me."
5,love it,I have bought this cd twice because I lost one of the cds...its a two pack...Love the song grace like rain and who am i from casting crowns.
4,Great contemporary christian songs,I have enjoyed all three of the WOW worship cds. It has brought back fond memories and I am just enjoying the current popular songstoo.
5,WOW 2005 ROCKS!!,Some of the WoW titles are sometimes not the best but this years is the Best so far. It is really a compilation of hits and i can't wait to get my hands on it. WOW 2005 really has all the hits and i think it is the best of the WOW series so far. This is a must have.
4,WOW hits,Beautiful music. It is perfect to listen to with impressionable young children in the back seat. Only a couple songs were too sugary the rest were great.
4,Good Stuff (Toronto-Canada),Great album I never really liked Christian Rock I liked Christian Rap ect. but this album is great!!!
5,I Hafta' Agree with Peter P. Wong....,"...although I JUST heard Switchfoot's Fantastic ""Dare You To Move"" on the Radio over here in Japan a few days ago, and it nearly did move me to tears!!! However, that said, WOW 2005 was a good compilation, with Day of Fire and Mark Schultz landing songs that did drive me to tears with their message. ZoeGirl put in another brilliant piece, as did Avalon, and Mute Math, as well as the various others. My only complaints is that Stacie Orrico and Jaci Velasquez showed up in the count, two ladies who've compromised their Christian Message with past ""performances"". WOW2005 is welll-worth the money!! ""Leaving the 99"" by Audio Adrenaline was awesome, as well, and even though The Newsboys have gone syrupy with the worship albums, their song is still good. This album is worth it!!!!!"
4,Beautiful artwork,"The Lord's Prayer is an important part of everyday life. The story that goes along with this well-known prayer is realistic and heartwarming. It shows us how we can take this prayer and actually put it to use in our lives. Great book, my little one (3 yrs) loves it."
4,Much more then I expected!,I bought this album as a thank you for the great entertainment that Zayra provided on Rockstar Supernova this past summer. I fully expected this to be a poorly produced home-made album and I was wrong. Rouleta is a beautiful album that I sincerely hope more people get to hear.Favorite tracks -HoyLluvia de MarThis is LoveLet's alll hope that tthings to come from this exciting new artist.P.S. MORE ROCK!!
1,Misleading title,"The title of the book is misleading. It should have been called ""Male Body Language That Allows You to Work With Women"".If you intend to buy this book to help you be more sexually successful with women then I advise you not to. You're better of with Ron Louis & David Copeland's ""How to succeed with Women"".This book only show you body languages that make you less of a threat to women, so that they see as a friend and so they get along with you better. It may be useful in a work environment but it will not help you to be sexually successful with women."
1,One word -- Horrible!,"The title is misleading. This is NOT a book that will help you attract women. This book is specifically geared toward improving business relationships with women, and possibly making friends with unattractive women. The grammer and typo's in this book are ridiculous. For example, as I just FLIPPED open the book to a RANDOM page I'm able to spot one right away. This line says: ""Is you chest is heaving?"" [page 51, first line] -- Now, if that makes sense somehow and I'm not seeing it, definitely buy this book right away, I totally must be reading it wrong."
5,"yes,you need this....","wont bore you with needless ramblings,this band deserves your attention and a place in your heavy rock/heavy metal/""stoner""(gawd i hate that term!)collection...while black sabbath where doing their thing in england,pentagram where trying to snag a recording contract on the east coast.this cd is a testament to what ""could have been"""
4,excellent,"I like this band: when I first heard Pentegram, I was suprised to find they were as old as they were.This band is tight, tight, tight. You don't get the type of sludge you get on a lot of 70s heavy metel albums. The recording here is very percise, and Pentegram craft their work very well, a lot of double tracking of vocals and detailing that is not on, say, Black Sabbath riffing early albums.This is the only set I have by this band, but I don't think that will be true for too long."
5,amazing,"I downloaded this album through iTunes, and it completely changed some of my musical tastes. This cd sounds like true musicians sitting around trying to write songs for the love of music, not love of a dollar. Obviously an older band, and Mr. Leibling has been in a few since, but Pentagram stands out above them all. Get this album, and you will not b disappointed."
5,Cannot believe they weren't really famous,"I'll be honest, I don't know what doom is but this doesn't sound like it to me. This is some of the best Rock n Roll I've ever heard. It sounds like Love, the Stooges, and Black Sabbath all rolled into one. I cannot think of anything cooler than that."
5,DINOSAUR ROCK GUITAR!,"it wasn't until I saw the movie Last Days Here that I got hip to these guys. If I heard of them before I surely do not remember. How I missed them I don't know.Maybe their name gave me the illusion of a satanic band, I don't know. I purchased the MP3 tracks from Amazon and I gotta say these guys are some rockin' dudes.Classic old school heavy rock featuring some Tony Iommi-esque dinosaur rock guitar. Would love to see these guys in concert. Recommended for fans of classic heavy rock.[...]"
5,gives the sabs a run for their money,"every song is great on this,drawing from several noted influences but still totally original,the evil's so thick you can cut it with a knife.fave song is ""hurricane"",this song has got about 8 ingenious ideas wrapped into a 2 minute ball of fury,it reminds me of budgie meets sabbath,if there ever was.""20 buck spin""is another highlight,reminds of zeppelin,especially the long-jam part of it.""the screams come"" wouldn't be out of place on sabs debut.just really great early metal songs,only starlady sounds out of place,since it was recorded in 1976,sounds like they were going for a pop-metal sound(geesshh!).a must own!!!"
4,"Blue Cheer, more Blue Cheer","Anyone who enjoys the original tunes on Blue Cheer's Outsideinside, with their trademarked ""lurching"" sound, would love this. I also hear bits of Hendrix, Mountain, Thin Lizzy, and Roky Erikson's 70s and 80s bands. Truth and Janey fans would dig this too. Not much Sabbath, though. I guess that came later in Pentagram's career."
4,"Easy, fast paced, effective",This DVD is great because I never have enough time to get sick of an exersize. Just when I feel like I can't do another one we are ready to move onto the next exersize. All of the changing and simple exersizes make this program seem to go fast and make me feel great afterward.My only complaint so far is that it says on the cover that there is a bonus eating plan booklet inside and there was not. I was dissappointed.
3,Hate Pilates...like this.,"This pilates just moves through at an unexpected pace. Usually I'm bored by it. I'm not sure of how effective it will be, but I liked it. Some of the exercises I could do at level 3 and some only at level 1, but it's all there to pick and choose as you need to. Instructor is very clear as well."
2,Write it in French (Barron's Teach Yourself),"This book is very similar to most workbooks with the same kinds of fill-in the blank type exercises. From the advertisement that I had read in a catalogue, I thought that this book was going to be different. I was disappointed."
1,Only for older computers!,I purchased this for my 3rd grade daughter to help her with spelling. I received the software and could not install it on either my MacBook or our desktop PC - our computers were too new. I was disappointed - do not buy this if you have a new or newer computer!!
1,What a letdown!,"I bought this program with high hopes because it looked great and my son couldn't wait to play it. When I tried to install it, it wouldn't recognize our computer's sound card and wouldn't play. Finding technical support for this product is impossible. Don't take the risk."
1,Not working at all,I have bought three of I Love ... books in which 'I Love Spelling' is not working on both Windows or Windows XP OS. Don't know what to do?
4,Bonus DVD worth price alone,"Some great reworkings of old classics, some obscure tracks made easier to obtain, and a bonus DVD documentary containing interviews with Dylan Carlson and European live footage. For the cost, a really great deal.If you're not familiar with Earth's music, this might be a good starting place, if only to hear Dylan Carlson speak of his influences and motives behind curating such a band as this.If you're already a fan, you won't be disappointed. The packaging is a bit generic, simple jewel case style with minimal text in booklet similar to many other Earth releases, but the music really shines as always."
5,The cutest DVD Player ever seen!,"I already had a dvd player, but I was at a retail store looking around and I saw this hello kitty dvd player sitting there. I have a 55"" HDTV and what really caught my eye about this dvd player that is for ""kids"" is that it can be played in Progressive Scan which means I get the best picture for my TV with a dvd player like this and the other one I had didn't have that. So, I was sold on it and I am an obsessive complusive hello kitty buyer and fan. I practically have EVERYTHING hello kitty so it was a great addition to my collection!"
3,well-made but double check the size you need,"My Troy-Bilt push lawn mower parts list shows this as the correct adapter 748-0377C along with another one 748-04082. They are different shaft sizes. This one is too small, but I didn't realize it until I had opened the pack. Now I am out the cost and can't return it. Measure the shaft before ordering. This one measures 22 mm or just shy of 7/8"". OEM-753-0606 includes the 748-0377C ..... the smaller version. Be forewarned and don't waste your money on the wrong one like I just did. For the larger shaft use the 748-04082."
2,"Worked fine, but then broke in less than a season","This came as advertised and fit my mower fine, but the key broke off in less than a full season. I bought it in August, 2011 and it broke in May, 2012."
2,Doesn't grab me!,"This is a hugely disappointing sophomore album from an otherwise overall pretty decent artist. I'm never sure with Smokey what he's trying to do... in that, the first album was essentially a mix of trad/old-school gospel with the odd ""souly-type"" track thrown in for good measure that kinda left you skipping tracks according to your mood. With this album it's pretty much business as usual. There's nothing original here to draw in any new listeners or to show any new depths to Smokey as an artist. Unless you're a ""riff"" freak, or in need of a ""word"" (not that there's anything wrong with either of these conditions), it certainly isn't a 2004 must have!And on that last point of ministry vs. good artistry - I'd advise that you check out any of Tonex's albums first."
3,It was ok,"I bought it b/c I enjoyed his first cd but all the songs from the first one seem to be all the same, I coulc not tell when one song changed vs. when another began/ended, I was expecting much more, but I will still support him I love his voice."
2,"Love the color, disappointed w/ the quality","I had owned pfaltzgraff for 20 yrs. So naturally when I decided to get an entirely new set of every day dishes, I chose Pfaltzgraff. But my Summer Breeze, while I love the color and style, has not held up at all. 3 of 8 plates have chipped, & cracked in two. My salad plates also have chipped. I don't know if it is just this particular pattern or if the company's quality is at fault."
2,BEWARE!!!,"If you are looking for a book of paint recipes that use readily available materials this is not it. This book is a blatant attempt to sell her otherbooks, her specially made products, and some arcane home decorating methods. The book was of marginal interest to me simply because I didn't know what different paints and finishes were for. That I could get the information for free at a paint supply store is something I learned after reading this book. I recommend that you check out the book from the Library before deciding that you want to buy it,"
3,"Fair, but not as comprehensive as it is touted","'Chilton's' is generally considered the industry standard in this area. However, I found this version to be missing much basic information. For example, no fuse block diagram, no door lock/door window control section, heater control removal/installation is referred to in parts of the book, but is not present. I'll be looking to Haynes next time."
3,Chilton's Somehow Always Leaves Out Info Needed by Beginners,"If you're a master mechanic, then this book can provide the tips you need. It lacks the sort of detailed descriptions of how to proceed that anyone seeking to make an occasional repair or undertake routine maintenance would commonly need. In some instances, YouTube is a better guide. Still, it would be difficult to gauge whether some repair is much to complex to attempt on one's own without it."
3,Confusion & missing info classic to Chilton,"As with any Chilton books, there were information that was not correct or some vital info was missing. One reason for this is that they try to cram info of all different trim-level vehicles of different model years. This comes worse in their illustrations. Just when you thought you were replacing a spark plug, you end up removing an O2 sensor (well, maybe not that extreme).My verdict is that aftermarket books can never match the quality & accuracy of factory manuals."
3,S'ok,It was ok... could have been better written with more vivid words... would have been nice to have had them better organized and more info about them.
1,"Lousy, no other word for it.","I have been looking for a movie about the conquest of the Aztecs, but apparently none such has been made. I remember seeing years ago a movie on TV in which Cortes and Moctezuma meet at the end. But there is nothing about the conquest itself. This present movie, ""The Other Conquest"" takes place after the fall of the capital and deals with Spanish attempts to convert the Aztecs. But this movie is just plain lousy. The acting is bad, the audio is poor, the scenery, costumes, filming---all are poorly done. It is as if the movie is the work of amateurs learning how to do it. Save your money. Apocalypto was far better.Dick Marti"
2,something missing,"I bought this video for a film fest because Cabeza de Vaca wasn't subtitled. Although the colors and scenery are beautiful, something is missing in this film to keep it from being an epic. The first scene is a painted naked virgin having her heart ripped out in bright, vivid red....lots of those scenes. There is a special tackiness to this film. Too bad. These stories are good ones to pass on."
2,"Long, pretentious and boring","This is one of those long, pretentious films that try to make several grandstanding statements at the same time, but end up telling nothing.The setting of the film is so low-budget, and the acting by Damián Delgado so, so bad, that the general course of the action ends up being slow, dreamlike and unreal. The script also fails to give the actions of the main characters any predictability or recognizable rationale.One goes along because of a general sense sympathy with the tenets of the movie, but one's patience is severely tried.A totally confusing and forgettable rendition of an intrinsically interesting story and historical period."
4,"visually stunning, is trying to say something spiritual but i just don't get it","the author(s)/director(s) are obviously trying to make some kind of philosophic/religious statement about the deep similiarity between the veneration of the Virgin Mary and the worship of the Mother Goddess in Aztec religion. but despite my interest in the topic and attention to the movie, i really don't get it.but the movie is worth watching, even if like me, you miss the big point. there are more obvious minor points that i do understand, the visuals are stunning and the period of history underserved by good films."
1,2 hours I will never get back again.,I bought this movie because of the good ratings it received and I am VERY disappointed. Horrible acting and no point to any of it. A Huge waste of money and time!!
1,The Other Conquest,"I purchased this video because the pundits compared it to Mel Gibson's movie a rumble in the jungle,. Well was I disappointed with this movie. It just dragged on and on about the Spaniards fetish with a statue (idol) of Mary. And how they tortured the main character (Topiltzin). The whole movie compares to the 1950's B-Movies. A real disappointment. The background, costumes appeared like grade school, really bad."
1,The Other Conquest,I wish they'd put in English only as there is too much jumping around to bring it to the point of really appreciacting the movie. Therefore I rated it as one star only
4,The Other Conquest,"This is a film certainly worthwatching for it provides a look from the perspective of the one that was been discipline. We see the constant struggle between the colonized and colonizer, where the native was simply seen as an non-educated/salvage person who needed to be converted to christianity. The movie shows that religion was the means used to control the natives, which infact was just an excuse to continue the conquest. Even thought religion was manipulated, the native indian still was open minded to try to relate or undertand the good part of religion as it try to fight back."
3,Heroine needs to chill a bit,"I really liked all the other books in the O'Connell series, but I'm having a hard time warming up to Briana in this one. She seems a bit petty in my opinion. She just seems to be contrary for contrariness sake. She had a chip on her shoulder from the get go about Gianni. I'll finish the book, but it's hard going sometimes. I like a little conflict, but my goodness, must she argue about every teeny, tiny little thing."
1,Highly Over rated,"This is a highly over rated video and it is way too expensive for the little value you get out of this. There are far better videos and martial books (not to mention cheaper) that can teach you many aspects of female orgasm as oppose to this video focusing on one aspect of female orgasm and not to mention at a over inflated 30 dollar price. There was nothing sensual about this video and my girlfriend just laughed at ""Denise"" and only thing she noticed is Denises' ridiculous tattoos."
2,"Needs Improvement, How About Something Different For A Change","How Many Videos Have they made on the Masterbation Subject?Sometimes A Theme can be overdone! How About Something DifferentThis is an over rated video and there may be some value however, it is way too expensive for the little value you get. There are far better videos and martial books (not to mention cheaper) that can teach you many aspects of female orgasm as oppose to this video focusing on one aspect of female orgasm.How About Something Different, For Instance The Art Of Oral is just as important and takes the same if not more skill. They should make a comprehensive tutorial for womenlearning oral how to perform oral ( on male and female )Hey How about a Different Theme For change! It just might boost sales!"
1,pass,"Definitely does not live up to the expectation. Not a great anatomy lesson, no great new techniques, only one technique - pause - in fact. Not worth the money or your time. Sigh."
5,¡Un impresionante Soundtrack!,"Desde hace mucho tiempo he buscado este disco, casualmente lo encontré un dia aquí, y realmente es impresionante, como fan de la película he disfrutado cada track, especialmente el # 7, el sonido de los violines es estupendo, recrea lo que ""Mr. Baxter"" hace, es decir la visión que tiene de Laura en el gran canal ...Impresionante, imperdible en toda colección de todo fan de los estupendos Soundtracks de los 70's.Augusto Borja"
3,Rather pedestrian score for an outstanding spooky film,"Pino Donaggio's rather limp score for the scarefest""Don't Look Now""has very little going for it..The music is ,for the most part,a mixture of new-age schlock and low grade lounge...One cannot really enjoy the soundtrack as a stand-alone commodity because the music itself is so forgetable...Imagine elevator music taken to the tenth power and you have this score...Sure,Donaggio does include the requisite number of ""scare"" cues(a must for any thriller or horror film),but given the superior quality of the film itself,this score is disappointing to say the very least..."
1,Doesn't live up to its promise,"I am an Asian cinophile, and I love suspense and action films. I can also appreciate the asthetics of quiet, space, and subtlty. This film really didn't move me on any of those levels however. The eroticism was fleeting, suspense soggy, and drama weak. Not recommended."
1,"SIMPLY, THE WORST KIM KI-DUK FILM EVER...!","THIS FILM IS AS DISGUSTING AS IT IS MEANINGLESS AND CRUEL, WITHOUT ANYPURPOSE..!I AM SURPRISED KI DUK DEBASED HIMSELF TO MAKE SUCH A PIECE OF TRASH.!!IF HE'S TRYING TO SHOW RESENTMENT, WANTONNESS, DEBAUCHERY, LECHERY, PROFLIGACY OR INSANITY, HE FAILS TO CONVEY A MESSAGE BY MEANS OF WHIMSICAL, RUTHLESS AND CRUDE SCENES OR TAKES DURING THE FILM.DOES NOT DESERVE ONE STAR...!!"
2,Beautiful and greusome at the same time,"If you only see one existentialist art house horror porn film this year, then you must see The Isle.The Isle is a Korean film about a disturbed woman that services small fishing floats. By service, I mean she brings the men coffee, has sex with them occasionally, and stabs them with a screwdriver if she doesn't like them.The Isle is one part ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and one part ""I Spit On Your Grave."" Sort of a cerebral feminist slasher flick. Too gross to appeal to mainstream audiences and too slow to appeal to suspense fans, I am not sure who this film was made for.On another topic, who wants to fish in a lake where there are no bathrooms? Remind me not to eat sushi in Korea."
3,Fatal Attraction - Korean Style,"This movie is visually stunning, as most Korean movies are. Although the story is edgy, it explores the theme of what unrequited love is in that part of the world, to which most western viewers might find strange or even outrageous. Unless you get into the asian psyche of how it feels to be fatally attracted to someone, you'd probably not be able to fully understand this movie.Some scenes are too sensitive and graphic for regular viewers."
2,HOOKED,"THE ISLE (First Run Features) is beautiful and bizarre. A man with a past seeks sanctuary on a lake where a woman rents fishermen small, floating rooms. In silence she brings supplies and prostitutes herself. The horrors that follow are joltingly extreme and not for the squeamish. Seriously. You have been warned, so don't blame me."
3,NOT ECW!,This DVD may feature ECW originals but dont be fooled! XPW was nothing more than a wannabe with terrible commentary and even cheaper production values then the original ECW had. A couple of the matches are actually pretty good and kept this set from being a one star review but a lot of them are a mess. Only the most hardcore ECW fans looking for something a little different should watch this set. Everyone else should stay away.
2,Not what I thought it was,"I thought this DVD was a documentary about wrestlers after XPW closed or even when they left ECW. I was way wrong all it is, is matches from XPW featuring ECW wrestlers. Good matches but that's about it, if you're looking for a documentary this is not it."
2,Broken and Dirty,"Length:: 2:28 MinsHoly moley... Where to begin with this one. The little TKD fighters were SO broken and dirty I just HAD to make a video showcasing the quality of this one. Check out the video for the facts.I give two stars instead of one simply because the frame itself could have been used alone without the fighters. It looked of good quality.And if TigerClaw sees this: Please, please, PLEASE make a better version of this frame! It's so perfect and cute to store your TKD memories in but broken and dirty figurines are just unacceptable. I mean, sure I could clean it myself and super-glue the foot back on, but I didn't pay $30.00 to do that. :("
3,Misguided manners,"This comes across as a polite rendering of Tosca, but the problem is that politeness has nothing to do with the opera. There is a measure of passion or blood lust that is lacking in the three principals.The Living Stereo soundscape is fine but there is a blatant performance error. Someone in the low brass flubs a note in the intro of Act II. It begins with a three-note descending motif: La-la-lum, Ta-ta-tum, Pa-phlub-pum-paaah. I am puzzled that neither the conductor nor the producers caught this clam. It's only 5 seconds into the number and it would have been easy enough to do a retake.I'm getting rid of this set and keeping the Callas/Di Stefano/Gobbi one for its dramatic drive."
4,START HERE!!!!,"If you are new to yoga then you need to start with this dvd. This is a good introduction for yoga. There is no vinyasa flow or anything like that, just a basic start of the poses. There are times when it might seem a little silly, but if you are somewhat inflexible (like I was) then you ought to start with this video. From here, I would advise going on to Seane Corn videos. Again, start here if you want to start doing yoga. Sara Ivanhoe offers plenty of variations if you are unable to do the poses as she demonstrates them. Enjoy!"
5,Awesome workout - easy to follow but very effective,I LOVE this workout. It's easy to follow but very effective. Some DVD's have such fancy footwork that they are hard to follow - at least for someone with two left feet like me! I'm struggling so hard to follow what the instructor is doing that I'm not getting a good workout. This DVD has great cueing and is very easy to follow - but it's a great workout. I'm always work up a sweat with this one. This remains one of my all-time favorites. Michelle Dozois is awesome!
5,Great workout,I think this is a great workout for any fitness level. I fluctuate between level 1 and 2. I did not have the bonus book in my video either. I went to www.prevention.com and emailed them that I did not receive the bonus book. I received it in the mail within 1 week.
5,I LOVE THIS WORKOUT!,"To be totally honest, I cannot find a single thing I hate about this dvd...Now mind you, I've been a FIRM lover for over three years. But every now and then you need to jump-start your workouts...I workout five to six days a week, this workout has been a WELCOMED change of past. Love the music, bright colors, superb instructions, my heart is racing as I do level three throuoghout. Love the ""twisting"" moves and I do have a bad knee. ITS A REALY GREAT ADDITION TO ANY COLLECTION :-)"
4,Good But Too Good,"I am a Leslie Sansone veteran. I also enjoy George Foreman's walking tapes. However, I do not feel this should be marketed and sold as a true walking program. It is more high impact aerobic dancing, something that I prefer to avoid due to a previous back injury. I give the video high marks and would recommend it for someone younger and more flexible, but not for people middle age, older, and those who are overweight or with weak knees. It's good but for people like me, it's too much."
3,okay,"This work out is not walking it is a low impact of sorts work out with three diffrent people all presenting their level of workout at times confusing, and hard to follow. if you are looking for a walking workout this is not one. it has combinations and steps that most people will not like."
5,Wonderful Workout!!!,"This was such a great workout. It was as challenging as you want to make it since you can choose from 3 different intensity levels. I liked that it was fast paced, well cued and easy to follow. The time went by very fast, and I got my heart rate up and broke a good sweat! Michelle is an excellent instructor and this is a great addition to a workout rotation."
5,Michelle rocks!,"Another great dvd by Michelle. Don't be fooled this is not your easy walk around the block! Michelle adds her own pick it up style. There are three levels so you can really push it or ease up a little, but all three are very challenging. Prepare to work."
4,Holy Guacamole!,"As a ""Walk Away the Pounds"" veteran, I've been doing the 30- and 45-minute walk videos for some months, so I thought this video would be a snap. Wow, what a difference. As previous reviewers have noted, this is really a full-on aerobics video. Compared to the somewhat simplistic WATP series, it will seem very fast-paced and confusing the first time through, but don't get discouraged! The moves are repeated several times in various combinations, and after your first full viewing, you'll catch on with no problem. And if you get confused, do what Leslie always told you: just keep moving, even if it's just walking in place! The instructor takes simple moves which will be very familiar to WATP users (kickbacks, kicks, side-steps, etc) and makes them much more challenging. The sweat will pour, and you'll feel great."
3,Good walk/aerobics,"This is a moderately good workout that does create a good sweat. It gives the heart a good workout and does push up the heart rate. However, if you have bad knees, this in not the workout to do. There is a lot of side to side movements in it that made my knees quite sore even at level one. Overall, it's a great workout for those without knee problems."
2,Should be Jump Around Your Way Slim ;),"I was looking to add a walking video to my collection for variety. I was very disappointed with this one. If you're coordinated, can do aerobics with no problem, don't need advanced cuing, this could be for you! There's 3 women that each do a different level of the same exercise which is cool. But if you're like me, you need basic steps and no fancy footwork, just add some easy side stepping, kicks, knee lifts and need warnings-- pass it. I like Michelle, I have one of her other DVD's for Pilates, but I couldn't do this one comfortably. She didn't even explain any of her fancy movements. I'll stick with Leslie Sansone. And funny thing, one of Michelle's exercisers is also in Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds! :)"
2,I am not happy with this watering gun!,"I am always replacing my watering nozzles and I thought this one would be great because it is not made of plastic. Unfortunately, it does not release enough pressure to do half of what my plastic ones are able to do. I thought it would be great - I am going to keep it, because I know I won't have to replace it, but I should have researched it further."
3,Disappointed in Watering Gun,"Considering the price of this item (almost $70), I'm a little disappointed. The watering gun doesn't release enough water pressure to adequately rinse a car while washing. I've bought $15 nozzles that worked just as well."
1,Here's something worse: These attachments do NOT fit Bosch 3931A Airsweep 120V 13 Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum,"These tools are useless. Slightly too large diameter and just fall off the wand. Bosche sent us an identical set, same problem. My husband finally got through to Bosche tech support who sheepishly admitted that this is a known problem and they are working on it. That was 8 months ago. Gee, thanks."
1,over-priced at half the cost,"It is an insult to pay over $50 for items that should come with the vacuum, especially at the price of this vacuum."
2,Picture of plate not accurate.,The picture of the Oil Rubbed Bronze switchplate looked great online. The switchplate arrived and it looks almost like a black switchplate.
5,"JOHN BUCCHINO'S ""GRATEFUL"" IS GREAT!","Having been a fan of John Bucchino's tune, ""Sweet Dreams"" ever since I heard it, I was thrilled to discover an entire CD of his work. Very impressed with the wide array of talent represented on this CD, I went ahead and purchased it right away. I have never heard such beautiful melodies and harmonies before! There is not one song that I fast-forward through! If you are a fan of cabaret and musical theatre song stylings, check out the works of John Bucchino and the many talented artists featured here as well."
4,masterpiece,John Bucchino's work is extraordinary. I own both of his solo albums and they are both great as well. His lyrics can be simple yet poignant and his music is outstanding. Buy this album.
5,One of 2000's 5 Best CDs - A Must Have,"I adore this CD. It is smart, poignant, joyful, and irreverent. And the list of performers speaks for itself! Please purchase this CD if you want to be challenged emotionally and ultimately, become a richer and wiser music fan.""Grateful"" is perhaps the greatest song written in the last 5 years. I feel a lump in my throat each time I hear it. Michael Feinstein's version is perfection. ""Taking The Wheel"" makes me want to take on the world and all it's demons. That's what music is supposed to do.Purchase this CD because John is the one of the two or three most important voices in contemporary cabaret and theatre music today."
1,'Grateful' is unduly grating,"John Bucchino is a darling of the N.Y. cabaret set, but this CD is an all-star disappointment. Too many of his songs are self-consciously precious and lyrically, he tries too hard to be profound and poetic. ''Sepia Life'' sounds like an art-song reject; I can't make heads or tails of the pretentious ''In a Restaurant by the Sea'' and the dreary ''Temporary.'' In fairness, I don't hate every Bucchino song, but they've been recorded better elsewhere. Michael Feinstein is a big zero on the title tune; for a voice with real depth, get Brian Lane Green's version on his CD. Judy Collins is lost on ''Sweet Dreams''; try Barbara Cook for a real heartbreaker. And what is Liza Minnelli doing recording? She's in horrible voice, and even a nothing pop song like ''That Smile'' deserves better than that. ''Grateful''? No thanks!"
1,Dull,"I thought the music was dull, the lyrics uninteresting. The only song that made me want to listen to twice was the Daisy Prince piece. The Liza Minelli song was painful."
3,Grateful?,"Am I the only one who thinks the rather pretty ""Grateful"" bears more than a passing resemblance to ""Happy Birthday"" from ""I'm Getting My Act Together and Taking it On The Road""?I agree that Minelli's track was painful. As was LuPone's. Several of the others are lovely, though."
2,Like the other titles in this series better.,"I just did not like the way this one begins. In fact, I haven't yet finished the book because of the weak beginning. Don't know if I ever will. However, I strongly recommend the Legend of Annie Murphy and other titles in this series. (see my review for the aforementioned title)"
4,great,i liked this book because it was really fun and interesting i read it really quickly and was amazed how the did the whole book on jay in the plane without it getting boring
5,Enriching and entertaining,"Enriching and entertaining story that is an excellent investment in time and treasure. Great conversation starter for discussing and developing morals and values. Highly recommend parents read along side children. Both will be impacted. Also, check out the author's other books."
1,WEIRD EXPLOITATION CLIPS NOT SEXY,"THE SUBJECT IS SEX (Facets/Other Cinema) is Stephen Parr's bizarre compendium of old exploitation films, nudie shorts, peep show loops, weirdly suggestive commercials, cartoon porn, and X rated clips. There's no narration or thematic thread other than sex and the dated weirdness of visual titillation.These beat up, scratched, dirty (no pun intended) snippets of found film (?) are unimaginatively arranged -- really just spliced together without any hint of artistry.It's all rather humdrum and certainly not erotic although at times very explicit. Unrated. 100 minutes."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"What might promise to be a great collection of classic short films is a total letdown, offering almost nothing rare, humorous, or insightful about sex in modern culture. With the exception of a few great early cartoons, the balance is made up of worn pornography movie trailers, nudist travelogues, tired soft porn clips, government issued health advisory shorts, and a few sexy 60's TV commercial spots. This DVD is such a disappointing bore. With all the interesting archived material out there waiting to be used, it would have been a whole lot better job if they had bothered to take a real interest in the topic."
3,"for children, this book might have been better presented","Divided in two parts, this book chronicles the civilization of Ancient Egypt. The first part focuses on the history of Egypt from the earliest times to the Roman period. The second part takes the reader along the country and provides a detailed map of each region. The book fails as an atlas : the author provides too much information about the various aspects of the Egyptian daily life and society, and the maps have no stability. Offering a helpful glossary, this book, for children ages 9 to 12, has many illustrations regarding the Egyptian civilization."
3,almost there,"transcendence is for diehard ambient fans. there are parts,such as ""ancient artifacts"" that are really quite haunting. the last track ""veil of the twilight moon"" is standard synth washes. some of the tracks, although well performed and well written, just do not have a ""pleasing"" sound. another person might feel differently. what i do is program past the cuts i dont like, which makes for a really cool 25 minutes. try ""open canvas""- ""nomadic impreessions"" for kyryluks'[the artist]more polished work."
1,Great LOOKING Product,"Got this for my husband for his birthday. Took it out of the box and it looked great! Plugged in the iPod and it sounded even better!! I noticed the remote wasn't working and then, it made an electronic gurgle noise and died. NOT EVEN THREE SONGS PLAYED!!!! Upon reading some reviews, I realized that this thing is not well-manufactured. You may be tempted, but I'd say go for the Bose.We called Speck products re: warranty issues and got the run-around and shuffled into someone's voicemail.Stuck with a brick! :("
1,Pathetic for the price,"I bought this about a year ago and it didn't even last me the year. A couple months into using it, I noticed that the sound of the music would vary depending on the position on the ipod while it was hooked into the radio. If you touched it or moved it a bit, you could hear static and whatnot. Sometimes it would have audio issues on it's own and I'd have to wiggle my ipod around and get it just right for the sound to sound normal. Songs with more bass cause the woofer to buzz as well as if it can't handle the frequency. Just tonight, the thing ""died""; it doesn't play the music even though the ipod is playing through it. That's what caused me to hop on here and let everyone else know that this is a nice looking, but pretty crappy ipod player."
2,"Spread thin, lacking depth","Keith covers a wide range of topics in this book. Unfortunately, the discussion is shallow, and you will find yourself seeking additional resources for all of the topics covered in the book. If you are looking for a high level overview of the technologies involved because you are new to web services, this book is for you. But if you are looking to fully understand the architectural and implementation details for the core web services technologies, be prepared to buy some more books."
4,A First Look,"Having already read another book on Web Services, most of this was not new. However, that does not mean that I found the book to be a redundant addition to my collection. The author does an excellent job of drilling down to the core technologies, XML, SOAP, WSDL, and offers ground level explanations of the technology as well as how they contribute to Web Services.This is an Architecture and Implementation book not an Applied book, so don't expect detailed practical examples, that give you the details of a new widget to use in your next project. The examples provide a good look at the nuts and bolts of the various aspects that the author covers, but that's about all. The author does a good job of providing a comprehensive view of the technology. About the only thing I can say bad about the book is that the white cover gets dirty way too fast.P-)"
4,Good book,"Keith does a pretty good job of introducing the various peices of web services and how they fit into the .NET world, including things i haven't seen elsewhere such as WSDL's extension points, and some coverage of WSE/GXA. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to get started in web services on .NET (you should also check out Yasser Shohoud's book Real World XML Web Services)"
1,It is not a reference. It is only an overview.,"Hi,In the first chapters, where the Keith describes the protocols and underlying technologies of the XML WebServices, the reader gets more question marks in his head only. The explanations are very short. Actually there is no explanation, the author recommends to see the specifications foreach topic. For many things even there isn't any information.As you read the book, you get the feeling that the author knows everything about web services, but he is not willing to show everything. Maybe he didn't have much time for the book, or had other things to do.Kaan Ozturk"
5,Excellent resource,"This book was recommended in The Unofficial Guide to Childcare (another book I loved) so I picked it up. Boy, am I ever glad I found out about this book. It had so many helpful tips on storing expressed milk, pumping at work, adjusting your feeding schedule on your working and non-working days, and more. It's an all-round great book."
5,great book for working moms,"I couldn't have breastfed my baby for as long as I have without the help of this book. I give it as a baby shower gift, combined with La Leche League's ""Womanly Art of Breastfeeding""."
4,Informative,"Nursing Mother, Working Mother really covered all the bases of breastfeeding. I felt confident about returning to work and continuing to breast feed my child. A definite must read for a mother contemplating weaning simply because they are returning to the work force."
2,Outdated,"This book was very outdated. You can find more information online about nursing and working. If you want to read it, borrow it from the library instead."
2,Co-Sleeping Propaganda,"I purchased this book after the birth of my son, hoping for some insight into combining work and motherhood. There was some useful information, but most of the book made me feel inadequate for not co-sleeping with my child. The general message is that you will not be able to bond and maintain closeness with your child if you choose not to co-sleep. My son is now 5 months old and I continue breastfeeding, pumping and working fulltime and feel very good about our relationship. I wish the other reviews I read had been more upfront about this issue."
1,Made in china,the reason this guitar is so cheap is because it was MADE IN CHINA. be cautious when purchasing guitars online.
2,poor sound quality,"I looked for a complete collection of Nat King Cole's songs in Spanish, and though I'm not sure this CD has everything he ever recorded, it does have all the ones I could cross-check on other compilations.But the sound quality is very bad. It sounds as if this CD wasn't made from master tapes, as there is a lot of unwelcome reverb, not to mention the way some songs fade out for no reason.I'm very disappointed. Part of what makes this music great is the crispness of the horns, the deepness of the bass, and they can't be found here. Even rips posted on Youtube sound better. I could tell the difference immediately and I'm not even an audio nerd.This is obviously some kind of bootleg CD, as the cover seems to have been printed with a home printer. Even the barcode is pixellated! Shame on Amazon for selling this.If you care, I advise you to buy other compilations, or wait for a proper anthology to be released some day."
2,Mis treinta exitos en Espanol; Nat Kig Cole,"This quality of CD,I can buy it on the streets,at two for five dollars.Don't expect future order fro Me.Thank You"
4,Wonderful Nat Cole !,The spanish songs are very cool. It's a shame that the ending of the tracks were cut. It seems that quantity was the plot here. But it is still worthwhile to buy this one for beginners.
3,I didn't receive yet my product,"I am waiting for these CD. I hope until 12, june, as you have promissed, it will be there."
5,Ekranoplan = Excellent !,"Wow had no idea when purchasing this that it would be as amazing as it is!These guys know how to rock and with a real originality! I love this stuff heavy rock with heavy psycho edge!If you like me enjoy Hawkwind early wind through to Hall Of The Mountain Grill and dig new bands such "" Earthless "" you will be happy you checked these tunes out!Rock OnNew Cd coming March 2009Vibrolux45"
5,Good enough to be a special present,"Collectable. I've purchased multiple copies of this treasure and given it to friends. A very special family, with a few select friends, on a landmark occasion. Buy it. You'll play it many times, and enjoy it every time."
5,always nice,"these covers are awsome they never get lost and they are durable, I have these on all my scopes. I would recommend them to anyone that dont llike the bikini covers that most scopes come with"
4,"Great music but beware: the MP3 version features ""clean"" aka censored tracks","Love the record, love Butch's music. This is the first bad MP3 purchase experience I've had tho -- without clear warning up front, it features ""clean"" aka censored tracks. I wasted my $$ and now need to go back and buy the uncensored CD too. Don't make the mistake I made. Amazon/Sony should label this more clearly and offer an uncensored MP3 version."
2,Undistinguished singing and interpretation,"Maybe Denyce Graves must be experienced live to be appreciated -- what one hears here are generalized, not especially beautiful or pointed renditions of popular mezzo arias, with no special qualities to recommend them. Her tone is sometimes pleasing, sometimes spread, her phrasing also of variable intensity. I just don't ""get"" her from listening to this."
5,great docu,"I really liked it. It didn't leave me wondering anything. And it had a lot of great footage of the whole ordeal. Very good story and docu. I remember seeing the live news footage of the shoot out on tv when I was a kid. I wished it had more news footage of the SLA, shoot out coverage, etc. But all in all it's the best docu on this subject I have ever seen."
5,Increditable,"Absolutly one of the best written books I've had the pleasure of reading, Mr Boyt was an incredable man not to want more spotlight on his endeavors.To give more to his comrades, so unselfish. For this man to go through the trails and tribulations and the horrendous conditions.This book leaves more to the imagination,a must read."
4,Nickson has opened the door on the ethereal Keanu Reeves,"The actor's life and talent are covered from his theatrical beginnings in Toronto to his present leading man status in Hollywood. The reluctant, press shy star with nomadic tendencies, a love of life ,and millions of adoring fans, comes into focus by Nickson's talent. This book is as easy on the eyes as the man is"
5,Fun book for wanna be doctor,"My daughter loves playing doctor and this was a fun book for her to read after a long day of treating her 'patients'. The illustrations are simple and true. Between this and her favorite book, Snickeyfritz she is thoroughly entertained!"
2,"Too simple, no substance","I was disappointed and am reconsidering ever buying books online again! You can't really see what you are getting, and this is just too simple to be useful."
4,I definitely recommend this album,"The only reason I didn't give this a 5 is that I think the 'extras' in between the songs detract some from the overall album quality. However, all of the songs are excellent, and Toby Mac brings some really original, upbeat, fun stuff to Christian music."
4,Rockin',"After hearing 'Slam' on the radio over and over, and then noticing another one of my favorite artist's was on the trac (T-Bone) I had to get the cd. Most of the tracts are just awesome and hard-hitting, I love them. There are a couple of tracs that are just talking, etc that could have been left off to leave room for more rockin' music. Overall though, just an awesome disc! I love the work that Toby's doing for the Lord!"
1,"First CD from the artist, a let down","I've heard Toby Mac's music on that radio station I listen to daily. The songs they played sounded cool, so I was convinved to buy this CD. After listening to the CD as a whole, it was a let down to me. A few of the tracks are upbeat and gitty, while there are a few tracks that are more a heavier tone, and some with a mellow reggae-like style. This CD seemed almost experimental; I didn't feel like I got a representation of what this artist was bringing to the table. The first few tracks were great, but the rest are majorly disappointing. This CD makes me ponder on not buying anymore CDs from this artist. If there are tracks that I do like from the artist in the future, I'll be buying those tracks individually from Amazon MP3."
3,I Dont Like..,"How he ripps off stuff from DC Talk. I mean, come up with your own stuff. I know its his old band but most of his songs are just very remixed versions of DC Talk songs. Plus it seems like he tries to suck up to the black audience a little too much (hence the African colors on this cover)."
3,Good But Christian,"This was a really good CD musically and lyrically. The problem lies in the message. While his morals are great and I share those morals, values, and many beliefs, I do not believe in god. I find it hard to enjoy music that is done by a human uneducated enough to believe in god and jesus and such. He is musically talented, but he really turned me off with his inability to face the facts and realize there is no god."
5,this rules,this is the best cd ive ever heard!!!!!=) i recomend this 10 out of 5 stars(yes it is that good)
5,*Toby's Best Yet*,"This cd has completely gotten me aware of the Talent that TobyMac has...His sense of style and word flow makes every song a catchy one...His music is wonderful for everyone and every age...His love for God is brought out in each song...It is NO ordinary Gospel CD...It is filled with fresh and funky Beats....If i had to buy one cd to last me ALL year long, this is the one i would choose...As I said Before....He is wonderful and Gifted.....-Cassandra"
5,Album Download,Toby Mac is truly one of the best Christian artists of our times. His no-nonsense approach gives the listener something to ponder.
2,Only if you like Hip Hop & Rap,"The radio stations only play certain selections that are less rap and have more of a song nature. What the radios do not play consist of about 85 percent of this CD. So if you like what you hear on a typical radio station, don't buy this CD."
3,"Humm...It's ok, but not what I hoped for.",This CD is just ok compared to Tobymac's other releases such as Portable Sounds and Tonight. I do really like the songs Getaway Car and the dc talk remix of Atmosphere. Everything else is just mediocre.
5,Toby Mac is for everyone,Toby Mac: Diverse City is by far one of the most inspiring and truly diverse CD's. It has songs from all the popular genres people like. No matter what kind of music you like you will find a song you like. I recommend this CD to everyone.
4,So darling and easy to clean!,"I've had this cage now for a couple of months and I have to say it was easier to clean than many of my other cages I've had. It is also so precious to look at. I have a mini-lop bunny and his litterbox fits perfectly inside the cage. This cage was amazing easy to attach to our x-pen and it just flows so perfectly together. I'm really happy I got this cage. Also it is sort of small to think about him living in it without the X-pen, but the ""ceiling"" is actually pretty high and he likes to hop inside his cage for kicks."
3,"Very Nice Cage, but...","Its pretty durable, spacious, looks nice, and very simple to snap together but the tray that slides under the cage had pieces chipped off on each side."
1,"Kennel-aire""A"" Frame Bunny House, 29.5""L x 16.5""W x 24""H","I have bought and received one Kennel-aire""A"" Frame Bunny House last month, but I found black plate cracked on the corner and 2 of 4 wheels are very easy to damage, I also sent email to Amason regarding these problems, but nobody response to me until today."
3,Broken Slide Tray,When i receive the kennel-aire frame it was nice but the tray was broken from the side.If Clean it and the bunny does urine it will lick from the they stray. I will need a new tray and i could receive a new slide out tray for my cage and i can return the old on that will be great.
3,"Cute cage, but not the best home for rabbits","The cage is easy to assemble and very stable. I am satisfied with the cage and the price I bought it, but it's still on the small side for rabbits (even my dwarf). I do let my rabbit run and play around the house when I'm there, but when I'm not home, I want to ensure my rabbit still has enough room to play and do ""binkies."" This is, however, a great cage for young rabbits who are getting accustomed and learning how to be litter trained."
4,Nice temporary cage,"This item is just as big, if not bigger than most rabbit cages you would buy in pet stores, but easily half the price. The cage is an okay size, but you will see that between a food bowl, house/bed, litter box, and anything extra the space goes fast. I would only recommend this for a permanent cage for a Dwarf rabbit. And even then, you would need to lay something down (like newspaper) because their paws would fall between the cage bottom. This is a great cage for if you need to bring your rabbit somewhere else to be watched while on vacation, or for a rabbit that uses a cage more like a kennel, and is out of the cage for most of the day. This is one of the best cages you can buy for a rabbit, and for an amazing price, but if you honestly want a good home for your rabbit, you will need to make one (using cube wire grids... very inexpensive)."
3,Problematic :-(,"I thought this cage was so adorable. Ordered it and it arrived super quick and very easy to assemble. The black tray was a huge issue. It didnt fit into the grid properly and Roxy was scared because. She felt like she was on a slope. She didnt like the wire, it was a huge inconvenience because we had just moved and were depending on this cage working. When I sent it back they gave me an instant credit which i used yo get her another cage."
4,Great Home for my Bunny,"This is a great home for my bunny (he is about medium sized). I did the 5-8 day free shipping, but the product got to me in 2 days! It was really easy assembly, when you take it out of the box over half of it is put together already. My bun loves to sit on his hind legs and stretch, the A frame is perfect for that. The only negative is he likes to kick his wood chips out, so I would maybe consider a liner or putting a towel under the cage. Overall great product!!!"
3,"Great Cage, Crappy Tray","I bought this cage after my parents gave my daughters ""bunnies"" for Easter. The cage arrived in two days with Amazon Prime. This cage comes without an ""extra"" shipper, in the regular box. Upon opening box, I could see right away that the tray was cracked and broken. So, immediatley ordered replacement from Amazon. Replacement arrived in two days as well. Opened box and low and behold, tray cracked and broken. I'm guessing that the trays are broken in the warehouse, stacking too high, under other items, as boxes appeared in good shape and no other problems with cage. Tray ships in the middle of the box, so it is obviously broken before shipping. Cage is great, and if tray was intact, would get a five star rating. Good size, a cinch to put together. Happy Bunnies. Tray is easy to empty and clean."
4,Satisfied,"Satisfied for the price but the tray underneath the cage was broken when shipped to me. And it wasn't like the tray broke while delivering but it seemed like it was sent to me with the edges chipped off otherwise the broken pieces would still be in the box! Nothing terrible enough to return it though.OVERALL, the cage is an excellent size for my Holland lop. Enough room for him to move around and high enough for him to stand up without bumping his head. My only issues are the broken tray, and the doors (in front and on top) are pretty hard to open and close. My little Ruperts happy so, so am I :)"
4,Bunny Home,"Good product overall. The slide out tray is a bit flimsy and it cracked the first time I cleaned the cage, but it was a small crack that I was able to repaired so the tray is still usable. I like that there is a door on the front and a door on the ""roof"". The cage has a good amount of space for one rabbit."
3,cheesy 80's fun,"Don't expect any great production values or too much of a storyline here, as The Love Dolls try to break into the recording industry in So. Cal. in the early 80's. This is filmed on Super 8 and apparently a bunch of friends just got together and made it, yet it somehow manages to be more professional than a lot of ""earnest"" people that are supposedly creating ""art"" these days using some of the same methods...go figure. Anyway this has members of Redd Kross, Black Flag, Blood on the Saddle, etc., and it chronicles the rise to fame and fortune of The Love Dolls and then their ultimate downfall, and all in 60 minutes...if only Valley of the Dolls had been that short. 3 out of 5, fun stuff but don't go into this expecting too much."
1,Hell No!,"College film students have more talent than the director of this debacle. I'm all for campy B-movies but this is more like a D. The director insults your intelligence throughout: from male singing dubbed over (non-)lipsyncing girls, hippies posing as punks?, and a girl shrugging off her rape for show business. i couldn't wait for it to be over. The Banana Splits are more entertaining."
1,Only If YOU'RE Desperate,"Unless you're a Vicki Peterson fan like I am and want to see her beating an old woman with a stick, skip this movie for its much funnier sequel, ""Love Dolls Superstar."""
5,The Epitome of Awesome!,I have never seen such an amazing film in all my life! Terrific story with the most quality detail. A must see for every living human. Oh and Dez Cadena is in it.
5,Great action movie with lessons taught :),"This is a great movie with Heroes that rescue but teach valuable lessons of friendship, committment and doing the right thing. My youngest has bought the action heroes and re-plays the great lessons during playtime. Great movie."
1,Stick with the Original TV Episodes,"I was disappointed with how the characters were changed, especially the women who now spew lines such as ""This is why we accessorize"" and ""I'll be fine just as soon as I fix my hair and make up."" You would never know from this movie that Wendy Waters is second-in-command.Also, rather than teaching about the value of safety and teamwork (as the TV show does), this is an action flick -- characters take stupid chances and showboat. I recommend that you stick with the DVDs of the original episodes such asRescue Heroes Adventure Collection Volume 1This movie is not appropriate for children under the age of 8 due to (1) scary situations that could reasonably result in death or serious injury particularly of characters' parents and siblings, and (2) the depiction of anger and verbal bullying."
5,Very cool!,I like the movie because it's cool! My favorite part is the earthquake. I like their mission select backpacks. Jack Hammer is my favorite.
3,It was a decent find however...,"It was a decent find however...my wife and I originally did think it was based partially on a true story. However, we were greatly disappointed when we noticed some gross inaccuracies 5 minutes into the movie. First, there was by no way a ""city"" in North Dakota other than Fargo and/or Bismarck that towers over probably ten stories, this movie claimed 20! Secondly, there are no significant fault lines remotely near this great state. To say that this movie is educational in my humble opinion, is a great misnomer. The buyer has been warned."
4,"Nice story, exciting for kids, so-so animation","My 4-year-old enjoyed this movie immensely, and we were happy to have an ""action"" movie to show him that didn't promote violence, but rather heroism. We're big fans of the Rescue Heroes toys are are disappointed that they've been discontinued.Overall, the movie is entertaining, perhaps a bit long, and the animation is mediocre, but if you're looking for an exciting, non-violent action movie for young children, this fits the bill nicely!"
3,Excellence in Cross Selling,"I just watched this film for the first time today. Yes, it was made entirely to promote a line of toys. It's an excellent example of Mercatilism at its best. Aesthetically, it would not exist except to sell a line of toys.However, it was well-written and well executed. I was not at all embarassed to watch this with my primary school age niece and nephew. If I had any complaint, oddly enough, it was not about scripting or dialogue or voicing.The special effects are not very good.How odd - this movie is all about catastrophic occurrences and hair-raising disasters. And yet the animation sequences showing these disasters are not what they could or should be, much to my surprise.If they'd invested more in these, they probably could have sold more toys."
5,Well done!,"My 5-year-old son has been waiting and waiting for this movie to come out. He got it this weekend for his birthday and has watched it at least a half dozen times, including the extra two TV shows included with the DVD. The graphics are good, the soundtrack excellent, the storyline is interesting, the jokes are corney--the perfect kids' movie!!"
5,Awesome,"I work at a Christian bookstore and we play hundreds of CD's and this one is one of my favorites; it's amazing. It's not the kind of CD that grows on you either; you love is right from the start! :) The songs are well put together and really speak to you. They are the kind of songs that make you stop and go, ""...wow""."
3,OK...CD...I bought it for one song...the rest are OK...for my style,I bought this CD after hearing one song...the rest are a bonus...but not on my favorites list.
3,Frankenstein: 5 Stars Wolf: 2 Stars Dracula 2 Stars,"The only really good movie is Frankinstein, The others were pretty dissapointing. HELENA BOHMN CARTER ROCKS!"
4,Good fit and price,"Forgot to review this. Its been over 3 winters now so this is a good review. Absolutely no issues except for surface corrosion. I live in the north where they use a lot of salt and winter gives about 250"" of snow. Stainless is the way to go. Good fitment except I had to weld hangers to use an oem type hookup. No hangers on pipes I imagine not everyone has a wire feed but universal hangers should work too."
3,good product but not practical,"The features provided are good, but when you actually start using, it doesn't fit over ear comfortable, not good design to wear over the ear for long time."
4,The Coquette,"This is a great story and I enjoyed reading it. Wharton's story revisits ground so many young girls and women walk upon. I see its moral value and educational value rather than its place in literature. I see a reminder to both young men and women that life's consequences visit upon us no matter who we are, especially women in love.Yes, the ruling class at the time stood alongside the shop keepers and emerging working-class and field workers. Of course times have changed and so too have the privileges, thanks to medicine, mobility, and the Internet; yet the problems for women continue today as they did at the turn of the eighteenth century.A good story seldom grows to old to help clarify the ground that we might still walk on, figuratively speaking. I will add this story to my Kindle in case my wife chooses to read it. She likes to share stories with her neices.Eddie Evans"
5,It truly is re-stickable,"I rent a house, so I didn't want wallpaper border that couldn't be easily removed. This stuff sticks wonderfully, yet peels back off the wall easily without picking up paint. I couldn't be happier."
2,Poor Transfer: Curse of Bigfoot/Cathy's Curse,"This review is for the Alpha dvd edition which pairs ""Curse of Bigfoot"" and ""Cathy's Curse"". I purchased this for my cult favorite ""Curse of Bigfoot"".The transfer for ""Curse of Bigfoot"" is absolutely horrendous, obviously having been transferred from a videotape in far worse condition than my old ""Goodtimes"" EP-speed vhs tape, which almost looks vibrant by comparison.The picture in this Alpha edition is washed-out, with the features of the characters' faces in medium-range shots even rendered practically without distinction.Yes, ""Curse of Bigfoot"" may be a ""bad"" movie, but Alpha's poorly executed, incompetent edition makes the picture completely intolerable. Even campy movies deserve better treatment.If one wishes to experience this movie for the first time, pass on this and go for an old videotape instead.Perhaps other readers can comment on the quality of the PR Studios edition currently on sale here."
2,Artists rendition of Old Classics,"This CD contains some songs that were recorded over ten years ago. I didn't care for most of the artist's renditions of the Old Classic Christmas songs. If you just love anything put out by these artists and you don't mind how they destroyed some of the classics, this might be for you. I would not recommend this CD for someone looking for mellow traditional Christmas songs."
2,It's never as good as the first time!,I thought it would be better. The first album was great. Can't say the same about this one. Much more commercial than the predecessor. If you want to keep the feeling- stick with the '96.
2,not so good.,"i really liked the first NAID cd, but this one... i'm not sure what happened. you can't blame him for trying something with more universal appeal, but it ends up sounding a lot like just generic old dance music. furthermore, the (english) lyrics are terrible. honestly i would've never guessed it was the same guy if i didn't know better... definitely a big disappointment for me"
3,A really good fan book.,Now if your a fan of the Moffatts you'll be able to understand where I'm coming from.. You want a sorce for lot's of information on them well guess what this book is so the place to get tons of new info on these great guys! So if your looking for a good book on the guys here's the place to buy it and nwo is the place to buy it so ENJOY! I really Doubt I will win the Gift Certificate But If I do i'll get Lot's of Moffatt cd singles.. SEEYA @ Blast.
2,About a 10 year old girl and WRITTEN like a 10 year old girl,This was an interesting book but it was not all that well written. It seemed like Jill Krementz wrote down Torrance's words without seeing how they would look on the page as opposed to how they sounded in conversations with her. I've read some of the other A Very Young.... books and have similar observations about the writing-- Ms. Krementz's talents must lie more in photography.
5,Important work on ethnic diversity,"Irwin Deutscher's Accommodating Diversity is an ideal supplement for courses in race, ethnicity, and social problems. How refreshing to see what works!"
5,A must-read for those with hepatitis or awaiting transplant,"This book is an excellent read for anyone; especially those suffering hepatitis, awaiting a transplant for any organ, anyone who has had a transplant, family members of transplant patients or awaiting transplant patients, anyone with any chronic illness or those interested in organ donation. And everyone should be interested in organ donation -- we are all very apt to be waiting an organ transplant as this author was. It is written in layperson's English so it is very easy to understand. I had no idea how a chronic illness affects every facet of one's life. This book is loaded with information and the personal drama of Ms. McCarty who also has a sense of humor. Buy the book (and buy one for someone else.) It is a good read."
4,Boy has Society Come a Long Way.,This was a very interesting read. La Mettrie spends the course of two essays describing what for the most part may well be common knowledge now. What amazed me is that this was a banned book at one time and that he originally published it anonymously for fear of repercussions. Boy has society come a long way.
4,All the info you'll Need,was a pretty well laid out book. Lots of information about the series and its legacy. Nothing about the movie but it was published in 1997 so...... A fast read and entertaining!
5,LOVE IT!!!,Loved the book and the miniseries. Even though the TV was quite different from the book I loved them both. Can't wait for the DVD to come out of the miniseries and I will DEFINITELY buy it. It is something I would watch over and over again!
2,highlander season 3,disks had scratches on them new out of pack!they run but they made a weird sound as they do!and some freeze up as they do!worried they might stop working later on!
5,Highlander The Series Season 3,I Love This Television Show I Used To Watch It Faithfully When It Was On So Once I Seen They Had It On DVD I Had To Get. I Kind Of Wish It Was On Blu-Ray But Regular Dvd Is Just Fine.
5,Highlander,I own the complete series and was and am a big fan. While I'll admit the last season fell a bit short of my expectations all in all the story line is maintained. Season 3 is one of the best! I was really sorry to see the series go but it is better to go out on a high note and I guess the actors were ready to move on.
5,Who dares to know Forever?!?,"Duncan returns yet again in this third installment of the highly acclaimed tv series Highlander.Having suffered the loss of Darius and Tessa and learning of the existence of the Watchers, MacLeods life has forever changed.The highlight of the series is the battle between Duncan and an evil immortal named kalas who has vowed revenge on Duncan and seeks to destroy everyone Duncan loves. Also in this installment of the Highlander series' we are introduced to the oldest known immortal ""methos"".This by far was the most intense of the seasons. Anybody who got deeply involved in this series felt the impact of the death of Darius and Tessa. They felt the joy of learning that Richie was immortal. Season 3 delivers even more intensity than the previous two seasons.I give this season my absolute highest reccommendation. The DVD quality and extra features is absolutely essential to any highlander fans library."
4,Getting Better!,"I really started getting into this series when this season started. My favorite episode was ""Shadows"". My only gripe is that they (the writers) didn't make more of a story with Duncan and Anne. Otherwise, I liked it lots!"
2,Flimsy and expensive,Purchased to replace a similar product from Francke that I had for over 10 years. This one didn't last more than 9 mos. without cracking during regular use. Very brittle flimsy material--should be significantly stronger for the price. Bad bargain.
4,Nice but flimsy,"Every aspect of the transaction--from placing the order through delivery--was quick and convenient. The tie itself is really pretty: The color is unconventional enough to be different, yet powdery (i.e. light) enough not to be flashy and brash. It is, however, delicate; that makes it fine for the very occasional outing, but one would not want to wear it too often as it could get ruined (particularly the stitching) quite quickly. Very satisfied overall."
4,The Nazi Doctors,"it satisified my interest in nazi doctors, although, i was more interested in their training of which there was little mentioned.much repitition."
4,light summer reading,"I read this for a book group. Not something I would have picked to read on my own, but glad to have read it. The analysis is a bit repetitive and bogged me down quite a bit. But that gave the read an interesting, probably unintentional literary effect of almost desensitizing the reader to the horor of genocide perhaps a little bit like the experience of the subjects of the book. It's also an essential study of the oft-lost human element of genocide, both in the camps' doctor survivors and perpetrators."
5,Absolutely Brilliant,"I bought this book several years ago, and I keep reading it over and over. Many people have never heard of the Nazis' ""bio-medical vision,"" and think that the Holocaust began in 1942 with the implementation of the Final Solution. _The Nazi Doctors_ provides detailed, yet concise, information about such aspects of the Holocaust as the children's euthanasia program, T-4, and horrible medical experiments. It also covers what went on in the camps from a medical perspective. This book is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn about often ignored aspects of the Holocaust."
5,Making sense of the Holocaust,"Both by means of a large series of interviews of the German physicians who made the life or death decisions at the Nazi death camps and by means of reviews of post WW II trial records Dr Jay Lifton, an American psychiatrist, has helped us understand their motivation and self deception. In this scholarly, but highly readable undertaking, Dr Lifton reveals and assessess the Nazi ideology that underlay the killing of millions of Jews, mental patients, homosexuals, gypsies and others ""undeserving of life."" In a preface to the 2002 edition of ""The Nazi Doctors"" the author identifies recent events of ethnic cleasing as contemporary instances of genocide.On reading Dr. LIfton's book after viewing two highly revealing and disturbing documentaries on the holocaust: ""The Nazi's at Auschwitz"" and ""Shoa."" I sensed myself to be so thoroughly informed about the holocaust as to be able to teach a college course on the subject."
2,Bad Quality,"I enjoyed listening to the songs since I have most of the music from this artist. The negative like with plenty of these dvd concerts, are poor sound and picture quality. I received the dvd in a little envelope and there is no 5.1 at all. I would be happy with just plain 'ol stereo. This is not the first dvd that I buy with poor quality. I notice the Morgan Heritage and Beres DVD's are of excellent quality but some of the other artist get very bad recordings released and its not fair to nobody. A pure rip off business. Nuff Respect! MP."
3,Counselor Book,"I needed to buy this book for a class I'm taking. The first part of the book is loaded with analogies and made it difficult to stay with it. I have since moved into the 2nd part of the book and find it presented in a more textbook fashion, which is what I'm looking for to write a paper from."
2,Green fenceweave review,"This fenceweave is a very thin strip of plastic, and not durable at all. It is also not wide enough to fill in the spaces between the chainlink, so you can still see right through the fence after you install the fenceweave. It was around $20 a roll, and for $25 a roll, I had purchased some from Home Depot last year that was twice as heavy, and wide enough to fill in the spaces. By the time you include shipping costs, I paid more for this cheap fenceweave than I did for the good quality rolls I got before.On the good side, it was pretty easy to install."
2,NOT ENOUGH MATERIAL FOR THE HIGH PRICE OF PRODUCT,"Took an entire box of ""Fence Weave"" to do one driveway gate. Have some band-aids handy, in case you have some imperfections in the metal of your chain links. This product is over-priced given the amount of material you receive."
4,"Privacy all the way, Less Expensive too","Used the weave before and you do have good privacy, with less expense than a stockade fence. We did the whole front of our property in Detroit for less than $250.00! Now that's a savings."
3,Not quite a direct fit exhaust replacement,Exhaust sounds and looks great after major modification. First of all the piping was at least 8inches too long. I had to cut the exhaust and use an expander to get it to fit between the factory heat shields. Also I would recommend buying new rubber exhaust mounts...the old ones usually are not in that good of shape. I am a Volvo mechanic and I had to make new exhaust hangers to hold the front 2 hangers on the exhaust into place and oddly enought there is an extra exhaust hanger in this exhaust.
5,Awesome watch,"This was a Christmas gift, and he really liked it. It's awesome and really looks great - classic, not too flashy, but still an eye catcher. Keeps on tickin'. Great price as compared to other places and more selection on amazon, too. I love Skagen - such beautiful designs."
3,HARD TO READ,I like the appearance of this watch and the thin profile but it is hard to read without looking at several angles. The glare on the crystal and the minimum contrast between face and hands makes it difficult to see. I have a Skagen 233LTTM with the same problem. I am hesitant to buy another Skagen unless I see it in person.
2,Just for Fans,"Hey Guys, Really great musicians, Of course they need a new vocalist to continue in this century. This album is only for fans who could help the band with the lyrics. Please buy the first live album instead or the DVD."
2,High energy drivel,"Sorry, but I bought this CD based on the positive reviews, listened to a few cuts and tossed it (and I payed $20.00 for it). Life is too short and there is too much good music to waste time with this kind of undistinguished, banal pop rock. I had hoped for some good driving instrumental rock, as I've known Lukather to be pretty good on the guitar.... but there's no way around the fact that Toto is an arena power-ballad band, and that's how they sound on this live CD. They remind me of REO, Journey and other 80s bands that I can't stand. I'm glad that other people enjoyed the CD, it's just not my cup of tea."
4,25 years later ToTo is still explosive,I've been a ToTo fan since their inception in 1977. I was fortunate enough to see and hear them live in New Orleans during the 1985 Isolation Tour. After watching this live video and listening to the live cd I can see and hear the energy level in their music like it was still 1977. This is a powerful live performance that will leave you with a greater respect for their musical ability. These guys are some of the most respected players in the music industry and have been for a few decades. It's nice knowing that they are still performing and influencing the younger generation of apprentice musicians.
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"This is an AWESOME album and DVD!!! I don't know what happened to Mr. Christopher who just gave one star to this album, but this CD is just amazing. 25 years!! WOW!!! And still with the same finesse and musical touch that has characterized Toto through the years!! Lukather? Amazing! Paich? Superb!! Porcaro!! Groovy!! Spinner? Fabulous!! Kimball? Incredible!! The medleys are just fabulous!!! If you like Toto, or music in general PLEASE, DO BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
5,Toto Live in Amsterdam Rocks,"I remember their music in elementary school, back when they played the radio on the school bus. By chance it was on netflix and I watched it. WOW these guys really rock and put on a great show! All the hits and more. Fantastic sonic quality and musicianship. A must for any collection."
2,Not impressed,"The book has alot of information but it's all pretty basic stuff nothing too indepth; especially if you dont plan to be using your spanish to order around hotel staff, waiters and shop owners. No table of content either; so all the information in it is pretty inaccessable."
1,beware of seller misleading buyer on product,I found this seller was very misleading in advertising the proper product and then overcharging on shipping cost.Show a picture of the actual product being sold.
4,Golf Clubs of the MGA - A Centennial History of Golf in the,The book is an excellent source of information and history of the golf courses in the Metropolitan New York Golf Association. Ther are also excellent pictures.
4,Decent,"Were a lil scruffed and was missing one of the red bundles on the ends, other then that there cool and there are exactly as described"
1,Not happy with purchase,The wires were not the correct part for my car. There was no coil wire in the set. Terrible
2,More like a Scouting Party,"This 3 CD set is too limited. It's more like a scouting party than a full blown invasion. A better choice would be the 9 volume ""The British Invasion: The History of British Rock"" from Rhino. There are 20 cuts on each CD and is way more comprehensive. If you are simply looking for some of the early British groups this one is marginally passable, but for the best in-depth compilation go for the Rhino set."
4,Worth getting,This is an excellent compilation of all the top British artists of the 60's and 70's. Great for anyone who appreciates that music era
5,Everything you remember ...,... and maybe a few things that you don't. Definitely inspires multiple listenings.
1,BE AWARE!!!,"I just got this off of another web site...""""""NAME ALERT: Do not think the album ""The Future is Listening"" is by our UFO. It is by the band UFO! (The ! makes the difference), who have a handful of dance singles. Be warned!""""""This isn't a Micheal Schenker, Phil Mogg, Pete Way CD!FYI"
1,"This is NOT UFO the rock band! (Whatever it is, it's awful!)","...make this more clear. This is NOT the classic rock metal band from England featureing Phil Mogg and Michael Schenker that has been around for 30 years and has a well-deserved worldwide following. No, this is godawful techno dance music that belongs at a rave...The ""creators"" of this dance music CD put an exclaimation point on the end of UFO, I suppose to make them different,but it's so subtle that no one notices: UFO vs. UFO! So, consequently, you have a lot of UFO fans out there getting excited, thinking the band has released a new record. Then this thing shows up and the police end up having to talk them down from their collective window ledges.The big clue here is the song titles. Mogg would never write a song called ""Don't Step on my Dog."" I mean what is THAT about?So... be forewarned. This is NOT UFO, the rock band. This isn't even rock music. God knows what it is..."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Don't buy this dreck unless uninspired, talentless, cheesy drums and bass are your thing. Totally devoid of talent, this cd sounds like the soundtrack to a sleazy direct-to-video movie."
1,future is techno boring and stupid blah blah...,"As others have stated here, this is NOT from the actual rock band UFO, but is basically braindead techno pop stuff like so much of the newer mainstream that is all they offer, unless it's more of the same sounding rap or hip-hop we've been bombarded with for too many years beyond counting. You'd think you could name it something a little different so as not to fool people anyway. It may be alright for those kids that are so easily pleased with drum machines and average bass lines, BUT, I must say one thing-UFO the rock band was not only very talented, distinctive and hard, melodic and accomplished, these 'crusty old grumps' whatever, (Phil Moog, Pete Way, etc.),are STILL MAKING cd's and jamming out GOOD SONGS of real music-and thank God for some hard rock bands that are doing so to give some of us that appreciate a deeper listening experience a blessed, meaningful alternative to this modern dreck! Amen to that"
1,Naw...,"You don't want to buy this DVD. It's advertised as 90 minutes but really is not even half that long. Just a little over a half hour! Almost 40 minutes when you add the bonus features. It basically is DJ Lord, who is an accomplished & talented DJ (2001 DMC U.S. Championship finalist) giving you a rundown of his routines, thoughts on touring with Public Enemy, and tips on becoming a better DJ. It has a small bit of performance footage, which is alright, but none of it justifies a purchase."
3,lOTS OF REPEATS,"yOU CAN FIND JUST ABOUT ANY FOOD TYPE YOU NEED, AND IT IS FUN TO READ. THERE REALLY ARENT A MILLLION DIFFERENT RECIPES, LOTS OF REPEATS. ANOTHER THING, SOMETIMES THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE VAGUE ON NON-EXISTANT. BUT I GUESS I LIKED IT BECAUSE WHEN MINE GOT LOST, I HURRIED TO FINE ANOTHER."
3,Get a edition that works with the systems software you have.,The edition I received would not work with windows 7. I had a previous edition which I really enjoyed using. Wish the new one I received would have worked. Received a refund with no futher questions asked.
2,Did not like this video!,It's a cold story and a bit scary for kids. I would not recommend it unfortunately. The students in my classes covered their eyes during most of the movie. Go out and buy the real Pinocchio story. Much better for kids.
3,Pretty Cool!,My children love this DVD so I love it too. It is totally different from the original Pinocchio but I'm sure they meant it to be that way.
4,Samsung Blackjack Phone,"I purchase this phone to replace my Treo 600 phone. So far I am quite pleased with the phone. Here are some of my thoughts about the phone:Great Features:- Internet Connection speed is very good. I can finally surf the web with decent speed using this phone- Phone display is awesome- Camera is suprisingly very good- Softwares works well (organizer such as calender, notepad, contacts, etc)Not so great things:- Email works, but it takes a while to configure it... There are two kind of emails that come with the phone, the default email application and cingular express mail, each with its own advantage and disadvantages- Battery life is not great. (You have to charge the phone on a daily basis for minimum usage)- The phone is slow compared to Palm based phone.A"
2,entertaining,"I love dancing and I don't get any satisfaction from this video. She does not motivate me to burn energy/calories and since she dancing alone (which is fine for some people) she does not have the intensity to make people want to exercise. On the other hand, the video is entertaining and each workout is only 10 minutes which fits my schedule."
2,Some high points and some low ones,I am a big fan of Jennifer Gilardi and I expected to really enjoy this DVD. So far I've only used it twice. The cardio routines are somewhat complex which is typical of Galardi's style but I didn't feel like either of them was a good cardio workout. The ab section is just awkward and almost silly. The upper and lower body toning sections are actually quite good. The DVD comes with a band but the resistance is very light. More advanced users will need a stronger band or to modify the moves to use dumbbells which is what I do. Overall this DVD is much more suited to the beginner.
2,WHERE'S THE DANCE MUSIC?,"I am so disappointed! But, shame on me. I thought a DVD with ""dance"" in the title would have some level of current dance music in it. And, no where on the label did it say it was set to dance music. Well, it doesn't. The music is like a fast paced elevator music. No motivation!!! I am cool with the moves, no complaint there, but when she says ""put some attitude in it"" it was impossible for me to feel funky listening to a boring, non-descriptive beat. If you do not expect dance music, then I am sure you will LOVE this DVD."
3,Dance it off tone it up,This is a really hard exercise program to follow. It is a good workout if you already know how to dance.
2,Nothing Special,"I'm not a big fan of the 10 Minute Solution series and this DVD just confirms it for me. Jennifer Galardi is a pleasent instructor and the workout is not extremely bad, but nothing I want to do again. The first two sections are soso, but then it just gets worse. The belly dance section was pretty bad and the two toning sections a total waste of time. Just not effective at all."
3,If I wanted to do jumping jacks...,"The thing that irritates me right off the bat with this video is that the first ""dance step"" you learn is a modified version of a jumping jack. I bought a dance workout because I thought it would be fun and I wouldn't realize that I was even working out. Jumping jack type of moves are difficult for me because the impact hurts my ankles and knees. The instructor doesn't offer any kind of modification for this movement so I find myself making up my own dances instead of following her lead. I think that the first two dances were just not my style but when I skip ahead to the third one, I can actually have some fun and get into it. I just think it's a shame to pay for an entire exercise video only to find that you can do about 1/3 of the program."
5,I really can feel it!,"This is kind of short exercice, but next day....uhh i can feel it the work done. I love it, its all about fun... and easy to do ""after the fist time""..."
1,Dance it Off???,"I went through the entire tape one time and then retired it to the bottom of the library where it will remain hidden. The ""dance"" steps are not only badly choreographed, but pretty dang stupid. Other ""10 minute Solution"" tapes I've tried are wonderful, don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,Not as Good as Jennifer's other 10 Min Dance DVD,"I really like Jennifer Gilardi and I love her other 10 Min Solution Dance DVD, ""Fat Blasting Dance Mix"", so I decided to give this one a try too. I am giving it three stars because 3 of the 5 segments are ok and 2 don't feel like much benefit at all. I totally recommend her as an instructor, jut get her other DVD to really benefit from her expertise."
1,No fitness band!,"The name says ""with fitness band"" and there is no fitness band! Why list the product twice, once adding ""with fitness band"" to the item name, and then not include it? This teaches me I should buy from sellers, not Amazon, since you can contact sellers, but there is no way I know to talk to anyone from Amazon. I asked for a replacement, but since I couldn't talk to a person, I have no way of knowing if I'll just get another incomplete one. VERY annoying.Marie"
3,For beginners,"I have to agree with other reviewers, the coreography is difficult in the cardio sections. It does get your heart pumping. However, the abs and legs are for beginners only -- I barely feel a burn. The arms get more of a work out. If you only have 10 minutes, fine, this might be good for you. I just do some of the moves with the band while NOT watching the video. If you are looking for a burn, try Jillian Michaels' ""No problem areas"". You can select a section if you are short on time, and it gives a great workout."
3,No Fitness Band,This DVD requires a fitness band which was supposed to be included in the DVD. The fitness band was no where to be found. I had a type of fitness band which I am using with the DVD. This DVD does not have as much dancing and does not get the heart rate up like the other 10 Minute Solution DVD's. It is definitely more for toning.
3,Tips and Tricks.. but thats that,"There are many good tips and tricks in this book but thats where it ends. I expected a bit more continuity on issues definitively surrounding server side development. It seems like it competes with ""Effective Java"" which the title does not imply."
5,"Very practical, very well structured, very helpful!","Dov Bulka obviously knows quite a few things about ""Java performance tuning"". He has a Ph.D. degree - I think in this field. Among others, he was one of the architects of the IBM Domino-Go Web Server - one large source of his knowledge. His examples are in my opinion very well chosen - they cover typical Java performance issues. The book is very systematically organized - it is a pleasure to read it. The examples come often from ""his"" Web server source code, but are presented in a very ""neutral"" way so that they are valuable for any Java server and also - at least a large part of it - client development. In the last chapter, Dov Bulka ""puts it all together"" and presents a sort of case study: He picked up an example source code of a Web server from the javasoft WWW page and applies ""his"" optimization ""tricks"". This way, he is able to reach more than !! 4 TIMES !! higher throughput - not bad!"
1,It is a worthless book,"The book has nothing to do with server-side java performance. Scalability? author has put no clue about this word in his book. Lot of java junk books are coming in market now-a-days and this books shines well in that category.Save your money and wait for a better one. Oreilly's upcoming book may have some value in this area, but I would see that book also before purchasing it."
2,So far I'm unimpressed,"I bought this a couple of weeks ago and really just started it. However, it is distressing to find an error of the magnitude described in ""Optimization 3"" on page 14. There the author compares the execution times of String comparisons both case sensitive and case insensitive. It is noted that ""an unintuitive result"" is when one of the IgnoreCase compares executes faster than its same case equivalent. A reason that digs into Java internals of both ""equals"" and ""equalsIgnoreCase"" is offered. The problem I see is that in my book the IgnoreCase test is timed for 1 million iterations and the same case test for 10 million iterations! So either there is an error in the text or the comparison of ""equivalent"" benchmarks is false. Leaving one without useful conclusions. The publisher's (Addison-Wesley) website does little to help - it says the book has a supporting website, but doesn't provide a link - nor does there appear to be a link referenced in the book anywhere I could find. :("
4,Good for those H1B guys.,"I have to work with Chinese, Pakistani and Indian programmers who were handed a copy of ""Learn Java in 24 hours"" Then they start hacking on my project. This book helps me fight with them when they do stupid things over and over. I already knew 90% of what is in this book, but it's nice to have everything laid out for you clearly. Where is Volume 2?"
2,Worth browsing only,"It's only worth spending an hour or so browsing.Most tricks are well known to experienced Java developers, such as using StringBuffer instead of String. And the book is too rambling. You can easily cut the pages in half. Often chunks of code is repeated with just a method name change, e.g. from println() to print().Although it's claimed to be ""Server-Side"", it's really weak in that area. Sections on RMI and serialization are trivial and not to the point. The chapter on Servlet is not convincing."
2,"Outdated, don't like this word, but nearly ""useless"" today","Outdated, so pretty big percentage of tips in the book are not really true currently."
2,Have not Recieved,"I have not received the lint brushes, someone called last week to check but still no brushes. Please let me know what the status.Thanks"
5,Crystalline Perfection,"Directly from the cd's booklet:""...all of us who saw and heard him perform have our indelible memories of this - difficult - , autocratic, arch-perfectionist of the keyboards. ... for Maurizio Pollini, who studied with Michelangeli shortly after his triumph in the 1960 Chopin International Competition on Warsaw, he represented the - absolute peak of piano playing - ... today, dazzled, provoked and unsettled as we listen to this playing wich, backed by a technique ""like steel and mercury"", sweeps music clean ""of the dulling patina of familiarity"", we can only marvel at qualities that challenge our preconceptions at every turn, forcing us to reconsider music we knew intimately, even completely.""Get this cd because Michelangeli's live performances are beyond description!"
3,"Don't buy this guitar, please.","whatever you do, dont buy this guitar. it has a huge problem: basically consisting on a weight balance problem. if youre sitting while you are playing there will be no problem, but if you are on your feet... you just cant play the guitar, because you are too busy trying to grab the neck that keeps going down. you will be tired and frustrated because you just cant play the guitar confortably. dont get me wrong, the guitar sounds very good and it looks pretty much like a gibson sg model (it has grover tuners), but i cant believe a company like Epiphone sells a guitar with a huge problem like this (believe me, you just cant play the guitar when you are standing up). and it s not like you are buying a 100 dollar epiphone... come on! just buy another guitar, save your money for the gibson or buy a standar strat. i just cant believe it"
5,Great Movie,"My boys loved this movie. My 6 year old would watch it over and over again. Great fun, especially because they really enjoyed the Hotwheels Acceleracers series."
2,Weak,"I got this movie and was very disappointed. My 4 year-old was excited about the movie and enjoyed it the 1st time he watched it. After that, it didn't hold his attention anymore. The story is too contrived and isn't realistic enough. My advice...rent this movie at the video store and save some money!"
2,Two Hour of Testosterone Laden Torture,The kid's a neglected military brat who runs off to risk his deliquent neck in a race with a ludicrous primise. Immature males will love it.
3,world race,"My son likes it. They only thing, he has all the new ones, so it was a little hard to try to figure out the caracters.But, we are always looking for new ones. Thanks"
3,Hot Wheels - World Race Movie,"My 4 year old really enjoyed this movie. He loves the hot lava part and threatens the family by saying he will ""throw hot lava"" on us when he doesn't get his way. Nice, huh? Overall, I think this was a good purchase."
5,Speeding Hot,"Great kids movie. Full of action and interesting colorful cars. Has drama, and creative thinking. Mom checked, kid approved."
3,Not so fast!,"I bought this for my three-year-old, after the other reviews said it was great for all ages. The plot was a little much for him to follow, but he did like watching the cars go for a while. I'd say his interest waned before half the movie was over.The animation is okay. It's all computer generated, if you like that kind of stuff.Just as a mom, I thought one of the lines was hilarious: The main character meets a more ""seasoned"" driver, a guy with a reputation for being ""cool"" and ""radical"", and the main character notes that he ""heard"" that the dude had ""skied down Mount Everest."" I had to laugh at that."
5,Girls,"We purchased this and other candle making supplies to, for the first time, make candles to sell at our Girl Scout's craft and bake sale. The scent of this crandberry fragrance in the soy wax was amazing and a huge seller! We highly recommend it."
5,Nobodys Fool rox!!!!!,"OK there is one reasonable explanatoin for this great cd .IT IS THE BEST!!!!!I luv the song ""SK8ER BOI"".... THAT ONE JUST GETS YOU FEELIN GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF... ""GET OVER IT"" IS JUST PLAIN FABULOUS AND ""NOBODYS FOOL""....just ROX!!!!!!although if you don't like the image of ""WHITE GIRL RAP"" kind of thing you might not be as impressed with the song ""NOBODYS FOOL"".People if you don't believe me listen to it yourself it is great.and i am pretty sure ull like it!!!!!"
1,Unnecessary Hype,"First off, I hate to label bands: so and so is punk, so and so is trip-hop, etc. BUT, under no circumstances is Avril Lavigne anywhere close to being punk rock. Weezer isn't emo, but while Weezer is a great band, Avril is all hype and no substance. The music is very derivative of all adult/top 40 pop-rock from the mid-90's on, and the lyrics are, well, laughable at worst, immature at best. ""Sk8ter Boi"" is one of the more annoying examples of Avril's work. Over-processed post-grunge syrup with overly-simplistic lyrics that sound like an 8th grade rant. If it wasn't for the whole ""punk"" image campaign by her label and such, I doubt she'd be getting so much attention as the music she makes has been done to death many times over. But whatever. This will probably be forgotten in five years anyway."
5,Avril's The BEST!!!!!!,"I love this cd. Sk8er Boi is my favorite. It is loud, fast and just plain awesome. Nobodys Fool is my 2nd fave it has great lyrics and is the best whan it is wicked loud.The other song just plain..............sucked.Avril you did much better than this. What a crappy song. Overall the cd is worth it."
2,"Angry young girl, please stop not punk","This is the perfect example of a bunch of rich, corporate old men in Brooks Brothers suits sit at a table knowing nothing about real music with an idea to make millions. I give her credit for writing own songs but lets face it this is uppity pop music. To call Avril Lavigne punk is to call Sex Pistols classical music. Don't get me wrong I'm not into labeling but a spade is a spade. I'm not knocking her individually or her music but come on executives marketed her look and made millions off exploitation. I saw in a mag I think it was SPIN Avril with a Sex Pistols t-shirt on. It was sad Avril wasn't even born when SP was in their hell raising heyday. Avril stick to the hard pop girl u rock but not punk in any sense of the word. I gave her 2 stars because she does write her own music for most part. Which is more than I can say for a Britney debut album."
4,Their talent is undeniable,"I was more than pleased with this DVD. The audio is far better than I had expected, since the Puppets' performances were captured on camcorders. The visuals are obviously nothing spectacular, but one is not purchasing this DVD for the visuals.There's a whole range of styles and sounds. During more than one song, I thought that Jimmi Hendrix would have been impressed with some of the guitar work; I certainly was mesmerized.The Meat Puppets are a unique band, and this DVD successfully showcases their talent. My 19 year old nephew, who is more of a mainstream pop and hip-hop listener, was intrigued by what he saw and heard.For Meat Puppet fans, this is a must have item and would rate as a five star DVD. For lovers of music, this would rate as a three star item. I'm trying to be fair and consistent with my reviews.I am biased; I love the Puppets."
2,Too many presumptions right away in the intro,"Mr. Salza seems like a nice enough fellow - however, having done some homework in this area I know that Salza makes some inaccurate statements about historical Christianity - for example - ""sola scriptura"" was not invented by Martin Luther in the 16th century. Many of the ""Church Fathers"" that Rome looks to that lived way back - some knowing the Apostles - would never allow any doctrines that were contrary to or not found in the Scriptures. He also uses circular arguments - he believes the RCC is ""fullness of truth"" because the RCC says it is. The RCC says it is infallible in all matters of faith & morals therefore it must be true. Nice try Mr. Salza - I suggest all to be like the Bereans and check to see if these things be so..."
5,Cajun music at its best,"another expertly done album,by jo-el,to me there is very little better than a good old down home cajun song.all of jo-els song are from the heart and fron the heart of acadiana.LONG MAY THEY LIVE!"
5,Belly Goes Deep,"Lisa Davis's book takes a gamble on one man, Belly O'Leary, a 59-year-old bar-owner returning to his daughters after being released from prison. He's a drunk; he's mean; he's got nothing going for him, and yet with every page turned I wanted more of him. No one likes Belly, his daughters struggle not to hate him, but he's more real, more a man than half the men in everyday life who lack either the passion to follow their raw desires or the conscience to know when it led them astray - as in Belly's case, again and again. What he comes out of the can wanting, other than a lump sum of dirty money owed to him, is all the tenderness and love deprived of him as a child. The poignancy and ease of Davis's writing is mesmerizing as she creates the world of a broken-up lower class family in Saratoga Springs, New York during an August heat wave. Her words coddle you as she tells a heartbreaking story."
4,Great but one thing NOT!,"I have seen this video some years ago and loved it. Wonderful story and wonderful acting on Father and Mother characters. BUT there is no CC (close captioning) on it!!! on that part, I am very disappointed. It was CC when I watched it some years ago. OH well...but the story is wonderful wonderful..."
5,A great lesson of rugged determination and grit to persevere,"The story of Douglas Bader's fight to excel in the face of overwhelming odds is a most inspirational and uplifting experience.It should have also been made into a movie as were two other stories of theis author-""The Dam Busters,"" and ""The Great Escape.""Edward Cox"
5,Uncomfortably close to reality.,"I could say this about most of Frank's recent books. I have read everything Frank, or his father Francis, or his mother Edith have ever published. In addition I sold thousands of them; I am a former ""Christian"" bookseller. Reading Frank is like looking uncomfortably into a mirror of my life as a former evangelical. Fortunately this trilogy of novels helps me laugh in the midst of my tears. In fact, I do not recommend that you read these books in public (on a plane, in an airport or doctor's waiting room, for instance), for you might find yourself laughing uncontrollably and then pleading to the white coats as they pull you away. This is especially true of ""Saving Grandma.""Although Frank's unabated anger shows through somewhat in these novels (not to the extent as in his non-fiction), here it is subjugated to his creation of superior art.Do yourself a favor and read the entire trilogy."
2,"A Decent Story, but Filled With Cheap Shots","Frank Schaeffer put together a decent story of a series of summer vacations from the eyes of a teenage boy. Unfortunately, it was much less than it could have been.The story itself was quite well done. It had several funny parts and lots of insights into family dynamics.On the negative side, the details seemed a bit too close to Schaeffer's own personal history. It made it seem more autobiographical. If that was the case as it appears to have been, it seemed to be filled with cheap shots taken at the expense of his family and his deceased father, in particular.This really came across as mean spiritedness by a son who seems to have some deep seated resentments against his father and is attacking him now that dad isn't alive and thus can't defend himself.Due to the approach that he took in this book, I will certainly be passing on the other volumes in this trilogy. I also wouldn't recommend Portofino."
3,Interesting!,Different! I liked his Father and have a great respect for him. I thought he was disrespectful as is father is dead and can't defend himself.
1,Apologies,"I'm sorry your upbringing was so horrible, Frank.I'm sorry you were starved, and beaten, and cast out with the dogs."
3,huge helmet,"i'm sure this helmet gets the job done in terms of safety. i however was looking for a helmet for my road bike, this definitely didn't do it for me, returned it soon after receiving it, helmet is just huge, not appealing"
5,Razor helmet,"Item is wonderful. Very protective, but nice and light, so my son doe snot mind wearing it. Received in excellent condition, well in tome of Christmas."
4,Saved my nose,"My doctor has bugged me to wear a helmet while biking. I never did until recently but when I hit a curb and went over the handle bars, this helmet save me from breaking my nose and maybe more. Frankly, the logo could be smaller - have no idea ""Razor"" what but a 60 something probably doesn't fit their demographic. Good price. Some wind noise if you get up any speed or the wind is blowing. Generally a nice helmet."
4,"Solid and comfortable, just not adjustable size","This is a very cool looking and comfortable helmet. It is solid and feels much stronger than my previous bicycle helmet. The only potential drawback is that there is no size adjustment, so it may not fit as snugly as a conventional bike helmet that has an adjustable band in it."
5,Perfect,A must have for biking or other sports require helmet. I tried others at store and not very comfortable. This one fits perfectly.
4,"Odd, yet splendid.","I first remember noticing this book in the first few weeks of seventh grade, sitting in the back of my English teacher's small library. Somehow, the concept of a group of kids rebelling against the petty teachers and mindless rules of the school appealed to me. Gee, I could never figure out why. The whole book is odd, though. Stanley Kiesel seems to have created a whole universe of his own yet he never fully lets us in on it all. The book's climax and coda shows us these new kids' societies Kiesel imagines -- the Bookworms, of course, being the utterly coolest. But my big question is, among all the wars and the subsequent stories afterwards, were are the parents?"
3,"Great headphones, Great price","Ive had these now for a few months and have been very satisfied with the sound quality of the headphone. But what more can you expect from such a great brand in sound. As niose cancelling i would say is ok only becuase they're designed to pick up voices so you can hear whats going on. But honestly i wish they would drown out everything including voices. I have not tried them yet in an airplane but from the reviews ive read thats where these headphones perform the best. Well i'll be testing them out on my 14 hour plane trip next week, so hopefully all goes well."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!,"I have never before written a review for a book, but in this case I felt I owed it to my fellow readers to warn them to save their money. Except for ""Bumberboom"", and the very last story in the volume (Which was fairly interesting), this book was a complete waste of my money and time. The writing was laborious, complex to the point of being incomprehensible; As if the writers were engaged in a contest to see who could write the most cerebral gibberish. As I said, save your money."
2,Not Dozois' Fault,"With the exception of Gene Wolfe's The Map, the best these stories can do is mediocre. Dozois, I'm certain, did an excellent job picking out these stories, and that the fault lies with the authors themselves."
3,Bleeding Through Kingdoms,"This is a story with originality, and a fun read.Written in contemporary, often tongue-in-cheek, style.For example, when the little girl in red on her way to grandmother's house says she is Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella mumbles, ""I should have seen that coming.""What if Cinderella didn't want to have anything to do with Prince Charming?What if she ran away to another kingdom and rescued Repunzel from her tower prison?What if the two girls traveled to other kingdoms in the Black Forest and met more than slightly different versions of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, The Three Little Pigs, Jack and the Beanstalk and other fairy tale characters?What if Cinderella's adventurous nature caused irreversible changes in Grimm's Fairy Tale world?If these things happened, there could very well be a Bleeding Through Kingdoms.I consider 3 stars to be a 'good' rating; and 4 stars to be a 'very good' rating.A book would have to be 'exceptional' to get 5 stars from me."
4,Wow! Very good singing and feelings,"I'd never heard of Irma before. I was listening to NPR and they did an interview with her oon the radio and she sang, ""Hold me while I cry."" I was sooo impressed with her voice and lyrics. I decided to buy the CD just for that song. And it's awesome. The rest of the Cd is pretty good too:)"
4,Very cute costume!,"My daughter loves this costume. The boots and the arm bands coule have used a little elastic or stretchier fabrics as they are too big for her arms, but she's delighted so I am too."
2,Dislike,"Prints word documents pretty well. Not so great at printing images. Since we've updated to Windows 7 it's been unreliable, and often it just won't work."
3,You get what you pay for,"This printer was purchased for an elderly relative who above all cherished simplicity and reliability. The printer is simple to use, with printing and ink replenishment fairly straightforward. Be warned though that like other inexpensive printers, it can easily gulp down several sheets of paper at once -- a nuisance.The scanning works, but beware that color replication is poor and the output often fuzzy. Don't think of this printer as a copier replacement, either B&W; or color."
4,Hooray! Finally FOUND it!,Got involved in the series late -- never could find the first book. I'm SO glad they published this collection so I could get it!
1,The Chrome Borne,I am extremely disappointed when I buy a book by a favorite author only to discover it is a reprint of something already on my shelf. ............
1,Buyer beware: Two older books masquerading as a new title!,"The one star is a boo-hiss for Baen books, which is re-releasing older books under new titles, apparently in an attempt to get customers to buy books they've bought before.This book is actually the books ""Born to Run"" and ""Chrome Circle,"" which are about a human protagonist, various supernatural creatures, and troubled teens. These books were originally part of the SERRAted Edge series of urban (modern) fantasy.The books are okay; not Lackey's best, but anything she writes is going to be worth reading. But not worth paying for *twice*! Shame on Baen books for trying to hoodwink their readers. There was no indication this was a re-issue when I pre-ordered; and even the book itself gave the older titles in small print."
1,I've read them before!,I am very annoyed. I purchased this book believing that it was a new one in the series and after a few pages realized that it was anything but! It would've been nice if I'd been told Before I made the purchase!
1,Disappointed,"I did not realize when I purchased this book that it was exactly the same as Chrome Circle, only with a different name. It was a waste of my money as I already have Chrome Circle and now I have two copies of the same story. I was very unhappy to have this happen."
2,Watch re-runs of Gilligan's island,"If you want to see Amanda Donohoe naked, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, it is rather boring and slow moving. Oliver Reed is totally miscast as the adventurer who advertises for a ""wife"" to spend a year on a desert island. The editing is choppy and sporadic and the direction looks as if the director was attempting to make a statement that he was keeping to himself."
5,A Very Happy Birthday Gift,I purchased these birthstone earrings for one of my best friends. She called me right after she received the gift and told me how lovely they were. She wore them on her birthday so that all her family and friends could admire them. I will most assuredly purchase more of these in the future for others. In fact I might even get a pair for myself! This was a very good buy! Thank you!Theresa Kurtenbach
5,Great service,"This company provided great service. Book came very quickly. The book was in great shape, and matched or exceeded the description. I will definitely buy from them again."
2,"Very expensive, not well organized","If I were picking a textbook in order to teach a course in curriculum, I would not pick this one. The layout and headings make almost no sense, and the subject matter is spread out in a way that requires great diligence to locate the information necessary to cover a question on the topic. It needs an editor."
2,Perhaps a little quality assurance,"The information presented in the book is useful, however there are a number of the test questions that are typed incorectly and formatted incorrectly and in one case the letter of the answer differs from the explanation of the answer. Its almost as if there was a rush to get this in print. There are a few inconsistencies between this book and the other major study guides and this can cause confusion. My main complaint is the number of errors within the book. The content itself is helpful, not the be all and end all but useful for review nonetheless."
1,An utter waste of time and money,"This book was a complete and utter waste of time and money. Although I am sure Mr. Endorf is good at his job, he is apparently not a writer (technical or otherwise). The organization of the book is terrible; the data is often downright incorrect. At very least, the definitions and conclusions show a lack of understanding and knowledge about the underlying concepts (for example, the sections and questions on object oriented programming). The sample exam questions are terrible and often incorrect. Use the ""CISSP Prep Guide"" -- although it too has some issues, they are very minor in comparison to this book, that should hardly have been considered a rough draught.I wasn't looking for a work of literature, but in a field like security you expect clarity, attention to detail and correctness of facts to be evident. Not so in this case."
2,Waste of time and money,CISSP is an objective exam and book has objective chapters for all domains. No useful reading in it.
1,Don't waste your money.,Too high level and there is no meat or clarity to any of the concepts that the author attempts to explain. I am struggling to get through the book. In a way I don't even think it is worth finishing.The book has a money back guarantee but you have to send the book back within 120 days and you have to have failed the test twice (900.00).I would get CISSP for Dummies or Security Engineering instead.
3,Spend your money elsewhere,"I'm not going to bash this book too hard. It does have some valuable information and it is easier to read then most of the other CISSP books out there. However, the fact is, your paying [money]... for a book that is 312 pages of LARGE type. Condensed down to a reasonable font size that most other books use I would doubt this book would take up 250 pages. In my opinion the CISSP ""all-in-one"" book is a much better value for the money. If you've already read that one and you have some money to spend, this would be a good second choice."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a good book that could help in my collection of information for the CISSP. I was extremely disappointed in the layout, format and editing of this book. The material lacked flow and was sometimes contradictory. Even answers to the sample questions were contradictory to the material presented in the text. Additionally, the author didn't give an explanation as to the reasoning behind the answers. Words were mis-represented (i.e. using the word ""that"" when it should have been ""then"") Furthermore, whole paragraphs were duplicated on the same page. The information is obviously a collection of paperwork that the author collected and put in his own words (often difficult to comprehend). Worse yet, an errata sheet isn't available.I have to mention that the material did contain some information on topics that I have not found in other books, however, I suggest obtaining another book for your primary study purposes.I hope this review helps everyone attempting to pass the CISSP."
4,attractive but easily chipped,"We have had 2 of these bowls, and both have broken too easily. They are beautiful but they are the least durable ceramic I've ever owned."
4,interviews with spiritual leaders,"Dimidjian found that four themes stood out in interviews she had with recognized spiritual leaders during her sabbatical from teaching. These are: interest in the subject of aging is growing as the Baby-Boom generation, to which the author belongs, ages; the integration of ideas from Eastern and Western cultures is continuing to grow; living and dying are intertwined; and lastly, what we ""know"" is never complete and is not in itself fulfilling. Ram Dass, Thich Nhat Hanh, Sister Chan Khong, Norman Fischer, and Michael Eigen are among the nine she interviewed. Seeing the interviews as extensions of her role as a teacher, Dimidjian helps to shape the interviews by thoughtful questions and perceptive comments."
3,Journey with a poor leader,"I had ordered 12 copies for a discussion group. We were unanimous in our feeling that Dimidjian was an extremely poor interviewer. She elicited only meager superficial overviews about people whose lives had great depth and dimension. Some of the interviews, such as Frank Ostaseski and Rodney Smith were excellent because the interviewees offered their insights, wisdom and missions in spite of her often silly questions. People like Ram Dass and Thich Nhat Hanh were dreadfully underserved by her. Having simultaneously read the book ""In Sweet Company"" by Margaret Wolff, also a compilation of interviews, it only punctuated the inadequacies of Dimidjian.I'm giving the book the over-rating of 3 stars because some of these people are worth reading if you try to ignore the author."
4,ok,this book is boring because it continuously goes on loose association and tangents about the envoironment of his time and makes it difficult to follow. Perhaps people think that makes it good. But I think it makes it hard to follow and read.
4,Bach as both Mundane and Sublime,"The life of the greatest writer of music ever is detailed in the book. Sometimes a pretty routine and bureaucratic life, if one ignores the fact that he wrote inspired music throughout a reasonably long time on earth. It is very useful in connecting the locales and circumstances of his working life with the music that came forth in each place."
1,Don't buy on Kindle,"Someone else has warned that the Kindle edition lacks the illustrations that appear in the book. For me a far more serious flaw is that the Kindle edition lacks this book's substantial index (one can view the index in the Amazon ""search this book"" function, but it's not possible to print it out. It's true that an index in a Kindle book won't have page numbers as locators, but the index should still be included as a way of seeing what information is available. Yes, one can do a search in the Kindle, but that's not good enough. Amazon claims that the book only contains what the publisher sent them. Fine, then this is the publisher's fault; however, buyers should be warned if/when the Kindle edition does not contain the whole book."
2,Poor conversion,"I'm very disappointed there are no photos, no illustrations, and no notation examples in this book. The text often refers to notation samples, and they aren't there. And, since this is an e-book, the notation examples should be active, and play back as a sound while activated. So this is an example of very poor usage of e-book possibilities. Hope we'll get an extended version of this book eventually with all the pictures and notations included."
3,It's OK,"It's located around and limited to the greater Flathead Lake area . . . like the similar movie about other North American areas, it's entertainment, but little practical value."
4,Rockin' Cajun,"Wyane has done it again with this newest release. If you like his music, you will love this CD. The only thing that might make it better was it were recorded live ! The Supporting musicians are up to the challange to hang with him as he leads them on a Cajun adventure. The piano player picked up a few licks from the Killer himself... Jerry Lee Lewis. Put this in your car CD player, turn up the volume and enjoy the ride anywhere!"
2,Worked great but ...,"This item worked great for me until I had to change the ink. When I replaced the ink cartridge with a brand new one, the printer would not rec9ognize it. It kept telling me that it was the wrong ink cartridge. I did the usual: turned off and back on, tried restarting my computer, I took out the cartridge and reseated it several times. I even unplugged the printer and plugged it back in. I eventually put it in the closet and after a few months when I needed to scan some items, I took it out and this time it recognized the cartridge. It worked fine for a while and when it was time to change cartridges, the same problem occurred again. Works wonderfully as a scanner, but thumbs down on printing."
1,Worst purchasing decision EVER,"I regret that I cannot give this product a ZERP star rating. I have had nothing but trouble with it from the very beginning. When I execute a print command, I continually get error messages telling me the USB cable is not connected. It IS connected, I've verified it time and time again, I've changed it out TWICE. I tried reinstalling the driver, etc, no avail. I'm finally going to dump the blasted thing and buy a new one. When my tech team from work was here installing a docking station for my laptop, I asked them to see what they could do. NADA, and these folks are GOOD. If you are considering buying this printer, ""JUST SAY NO""."
5,Nice replacement,Ordered this as a repalcement to the black one that shipped with my sons knife.He has a brown rosewood knife but it shipped with a black sheath for some reason.His knife looks much better with the matching sheath now.
5,Robert Adams translation excellent,"I haven't done a close analysis of multiple translations, but having cursorily read various parts from some translations and wholly loving Machiavelli's writings for the insights they yield about Renaissance Florence and today, I can only add to previous comments by commending the Robert Adams translation. It is not at all dry, the most humorous one I've encountered, with the wit (read: sarcasm) shining through. An Adams translation of The Discourses does not exist, unfortunately."
5,Worked exactly as described - arrived lightning fast.,"I thought my JVC Mini-DV camera needed repair, which wouldn't make sense for outdated technology like this anymore. However, a few seconds with the head cleaner tape made it as good as new. Very happy! And shipping was extremely fast, although I went with the free super-save shipping."
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to.,"Bought this to get rid of ""lines"" in playback on our JVC camcorder, cleaned the heads and it plays and records like new now."
4,JVC Tapes and JVC Camcorder Cleaner,I have used the JVC mini DV tapes before. They give good clear videos and voice. This is my first time with the JVC camcorder cleaner and it did a good job. I will order these again when needed.
5,JVC Mini DV Head Cleaner,"I am very pleased with the quick & excellent service I received when I ordered the JVC Mini DV Head Cleaner. As always, Amazon is the way to go if you want to be sure to get what you order, and get it in a hurry! Donna T"
1,Did not work,"This head cleaner did not work for our video camera. We had it hand-cleaned after we tried the head cleaner, and we think the cleaning tape has permanently hurt our video camera."
3,cleaner,It was not cracked. It came on time. Haven't had the chance to see if it works since my battery needs to be replaced.
1,Worthless,"Bought this to clean a Cannon Optura. After a few attempts gave up as the ""cleaning"" did not work."
4,Does what it should with ease and realibility.,Purchased this for use on a Sony and JVC camcorder. Works well and does what it should. Would recommend and purchase again.
5,Very Good Cleaner,"This is a very good video head cleaner. Earlier my camera was giving frequent ""dirty video head"" message. After cleaning with this cleaning cassette, the problem was solved."
4,....Just a Great Solid Blues Record,"Big Bill Morganfield's new record is great one. Its nice to get a modern blues record that doesn't have any bad songs on it for once. From top to bottom this is a top notch record worthy of your money. Morganfield's two earlier records I wasn't too fond of, but he has seemed to have found his nitch in the blues genre and the result is this effort. Stand outs on this record are Boogie Child (a nice tip to John Lee Hooker), Evil ( Great acoustic performance), and Hoochie Coochie Girl (What a groove!). The rest of the record is solid down-home blues album full of inventive blues songs that are definitely radio friendly. You might think this a minus (typically it is), but Morganfield pulls it off. Who says you can't have a great record and have it be commercial at the same time? Morganfield you should be proud, because no doubt your father would approve. I can't wait to hear what comes next.....ATL"
5,A must!,"I found myself among those who love the first generetion episodes of Robotech (based on the original Japanese cartoon Macross). However, my second choice in liking is this last generation (based on another Japanese cartoon: Mospeada) , the type of mecha they use here is more accordingly to the first generation and quite original in many cases, I sure love to ride a cyclone!!!In this boxed set edition, the Invid had taken control of Earth, and is up to Scott Bernard and other freedom fighters to reclaim the planet and get rid of the Invid once and for all. This is a must for any Robotech fan, but if you are not that familiar with the Robotech saga I strongly suggest that you take a look first at the previous 5."
2,Buy the Complete Set,"Was very happy to see Robotech come to DVD. Since the release of this set there have been several other releases and one of the new sets contains all episodes of all three generations, tons of extras in a compact case. Save some shelf space and a ton of cash and get the complete series."
5,Great for a McDonalds Addict.,Looking for a cute gift for a colleague who eats McDonalds all the time?This is cute and a conversation starter..
5,pinnacle study,"this is about the legendary 84 siddha who were able to transcend the dense activity of their time and reach a way of life that expresses the ideal. I compare this to the ideals of theosophy, etc. (compare with Spalding's ""Life and Teachings"") top rate."
2,"Low budget, but ""OK"" movies","Being a fan of old black and white movies, I was really looking forward to ""Haunted House"". Well, I'm not really sure why they even called it that because you never actually get to the house until the movie is almost over. Then the house is nothing more that a single room with a fireplace. There are much better movies that actually have a haunted or scary house in them. I did like the movie for the main 2 young actors. Everyone did a good job for what they had to work with. I have not watched ""Snow Creature"" yet."
4,"If You Own The Previous Version, DON'T BOTHER!","It's kind of obvious: own the Real World CS book, why buy the CS2 one, right? Absolutely! But I gave it a shot anyway, just for kicks. And, yes, it the same word for word except for some new 100-150 pages concerning Camera RAW as well as other Abobe CS2 adjustments. The authors reuse most, if not all, diagrams though example photos are different. That's the only reason I gave this book 4 stars, while the previous version is well worth all 5.For folks who ARE looking to get a CS2 book that goes beyound those Bible and Dummie books, this is the ONE. It deals only with the newer additions to the Tools palette and disposes with the repetative basics altogether. This book is pretty much cover-to-cover of advanced material for those who want to delve deep into Photoshop CS2."
5,Intelligently written,"Simple. Thorough. Logical. I have a few PS books and this is one of the best because:1. Down to business, not a bunch of jokes mixed in, which I don't have time for2. Good example pictures...not too far out weird example pictures like some other books3. Laid out like a textbook (not to be confused with classroom in a book series)Because of this copy which I purchased used for very cheap I think I will upgrade to Real World...CS5."
3,Nice but ....,This watch was very beautiful but the band never would stay clasped and my husband never really got to wear it. We still have it but have never sent it back to Fossil to be repaired.
2,"Looks cheap, gimmicky and I sent it back","It was larger than I expected from the images, thicker too. In my opinion it didn't look as classy as the picture made me believe.I was very disappointed that the regular second hand was NOT in fact the large sweeping thin hand, that's actually only for the stop watch. The regular second hand is one of the gimmicky minature dials in the middle.Really, with the extra bulk and my dislike of which hands were which, and the cheaper look of the watch in person, I never actually put it on before sending it back."
1,Great sound BOOOOOoooring performance.. I gave mine away.,I collect many Blue-Ray concerts...This was the worst and gave it away. I was expecting something better considering the reviews on here.. Guess there are a lot more hard core Dave Mathew groupies than I thought.. I have overlooked bad Video/Audio because the artist did a good job.I would have been upset if I paid to see this..
1,What happened??,"Live at Luther College is amazing. Tim Reynolds expanded my awareness of what an acoustic guitar can do in the hands of a genius with exceeding technical skill; his composition ""Stream"" is mindblowing, as are his solos/riffs on songs like Ants Marching and Tripping Billies. So:What happened??I had the highest hopes for this album. Even after a disappointing first disc, I thought surely the ""classic"" songs at the end of disc 2 would be winners. But, sadly, no.The only song I think I will listen to in the future from this show is ""The Maker"". I have heard the DMB cover from the early 90s, the revamped version (e.g., Live in Chicago), although never the original; Dave puts some extra soul into this one, that comes through with only a couple acoustic guitars as backing."
5,Amazing!,This CD is wonderful. I listened to it on my drive from Colorado to Chicago and I would play songs over and over. I highly recommend this CD. It's one of DMB's best live concerts!
5,an amazing concert,"This is an amazing concert, For anyone who is even remotely a Dave Matthews fan this is a most buy. Tim and Dave together I believe is one of the best duos of all time. I hope i get the chance to see them in concert together"
5,so happy,"this album makes me dance. it is simply BEAUTIFUL - if you are a Dave fan, this is the Best....... of the best.... and i can't get over Tim Reynolds...he is absolutley magical. * * *"
5,Great album by the masters,"This DVD is in many ways better than Live at Luther College. For one thing, Dave and Tim have gotten much better since then and there are many more great songs that they perform. Also, Dave does a lot more story telling during the performance filling the audience in on some incites he had when he wrote some of the songs. Finally, as a lover of the Luther College CD, it was great to actually be able to see what Dave and Tim look like on stage together. A must own for any DMB fan!"
3,Nice Album,"After hearing tons of recordings and live performances by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, I have to say I wasn't that impressed with this album. They seemed very unenthusiastic. I was so excited to listen to it only to be very disappointed and I have only listened to it a few times, guess I'll sell it used on here! If you want a great CD check out Into the Wild Soundtrack by Eddie Vedder!"
3,I'll take Dave Matthews Band over Dave and Tim any day...,"This isn't bad for what it is, but what drew me to Dave Matthews Band back in the mid-90's was just that... the band. Part of the appeal, to me, of Dave Matthews Band's music is their musicianship, both in-studio and on-stage. Every member brings something complementary to the overall sound, like pieces of a puzzle that fit together perfectly. So if you're a big fan of acoustic guitar work or you like DMB just because of Dave, go for it. But if you're a fan of the entire band and their overall sound, this may not be the best choice for you."
5,Doesn't get any better.,"While I'm a big fan of DMB, for me it doesn't get any better than his solo-acoustic stuff (a la Farm Aid), or his acoustic duo's with Tim Reynolds (Guitar God).I could go on and on, but just buy this DVD if you love music, particulary acoustic-guitar music. You won't find anything better on acousic guitar.I own MANY DVD concerts, including all of DMB's, Jack Johnson, Ben Harper, Johnny Cash...... and this one is by far my #1. I put in on all the time, even just for background noise while I'm in the house. It never gets old."
3,Very mellow,"This is a great quality DVD and the music is great, but Dave acts like he's twacked out in some parts and talks way too much. If you're looking for a DVD to pop in and rock out to, this is not it. If you're looking for something to relax to, this is a good choice."
3,nice,"Nice Blue ray, but wish it was on one disc and got rid of some of the so so songs. I also agree with the one reviewer that said he only watched this once in a year. I may watch it again but not anytime soon."
3,"ehh, getting tired of Dave's live recordings with Tim.","What's with all his Live recordings with Tim sound the same? They do that annoying guitar vibrato?Good songs, good singing. Enjoyable cd, just feels like more of the same with Dave.Tim plays well but people that think he is a guitar G-D need to seriously take a step back and listen to some of the 80's and 70's guitar legends. Those guys had as much if not more talent than Tim. Tim is a GREAT guitarist, but not the end all be all of rock artists."
4,"Very good, but not great","I've seen Dave and Tim twice. Once at Radio City in 2003 and at West Point the same year. Maybe having seen those shows makes me biased, but in my opinion Dave's singing sounds a little flat on this recording during some of the classics like #41, Bartender, Grace is Gone and Lie on Our Graves. Compared to Luther College Dave almost sounds like he's a bit bored or just going through the motions at times and as others have said, Tim doesn't shine on this recording. Fortunately, the new tracks are very good and there's plenty still to enjoy.For the DMB fans out there who have a collection of shows which might include some D&T; recordings from the past, this set might be a little disappointing. It doesn't compare to the Boone performance from 2003 widely available thru legal trading for example where Dave sings with amazing energy and Tim shines as the guitar virtuoso that he is. This one is still worth picking up, but it's not the best example of a D&T; show out there."
3,Good...But Not Exactly What I Expected,"Both the music and DVD quality are good, well above average. At first, I didn't find Dave's talking in between songs much of a problem. By the end of the DVD, I realized that it had become a distraction for me and detracted from my overall enjoyment of the concert."
4,Excellent Duo,"I liked the way Dave and Tim were doing with their guitars. It is amazing what you can do just with 2 guitars.The blu-ray format is incredible.I won't write too much about Dave's singing skill. There are plenty of them. But just assure you that you will not regret your purchase, if you like good vocal, realistic lyrics and good guitar playing..."
5,Awesome !,"I wanted to showcase my Home Theatre and I never got the perfect blend of audio and picture until now. This Blu-Ray shines. The picture is crystal clear and the audio and indescribable. I love this concert on DVD Blu-Ray. I was using the EAgles DVD, Hell freezes over to showcase my system. It was good but it was not HD audio , this is and the difference is hugh."
5,Best concert I own,"I have a 100 inch screen, a Panasonic AE 4000 U projector, three Adcom amps, Klipsch KLF-30's, Klipsch center, Klipsch rears, Blu-Ray player, Pioneer Elite receiver, Dayton Titanic sub. I built this system for Blu-Ray concerts. No little plastic crappy speakers in my Concert Room. I own tons of concerts. This is BY FAR the best concert I own. I am a Dave and Tim fan, not as much as others, but I religiously watch this concert weekly. The 1080 resolution, Tru-HD, 24P, Radio City Music Hall, man, it just don't get any better. The sound is amazing. When people come over to check out the system, this is absolutely the disc that goes in. For $22, you will get your moneys worth, guarantee. My #1 on the disc? Old Dirt Hill. 2 acoustic guitars, how is my question, incredible."
5,Studio Reference!!!!!!!,"In the new age of blu-ray, this is with out the best ref-guide material out to date."
3,"lovely, lyrical, and lack-luster","Kim Water's voice is very pretty. Hans Christian's instrumentals are wonderfully subtle and create the real East-West fusion here. Though I can feel their devotion, I am much less enthusiastic than many of the other reviewers.Bengali Vaishnava songs, the inspiration for these songs, are known for ecstatic devotion, intense longing, and/or deep pathos. You won't find that here. Instead, a meditative exotic atmosphere replaces the soul's passionate call to the divine. Very spiritual, but not capturing the ""rasa"" I would have expected.Most of these melodies in this album are based on the melodies and interpretations of that the Radha Krishna Temple(s) and George Harrison produced around 1970. These are all really great. I am a little surprised that none of the editors' comments acknowledge the source material and inspiration for these songs."
5,rasa is sublime,"The world needs more music like this! It nourishes the soul, quiets the mind and quenches the deepest inner thirst with extraordinary beauty. This music has a connection to Spirit that is difficult to find in other artists. Kim's voice is transcendant, Hans' playing and arranging are magnificent. It fills me with joy every time I listen to it. Bless you Hans and Kim!"
4,The Essence Of Good World Music,"Rasa's Devotion is as strong a debut as one could hope for; if you enjoy traditional middle eastern music but with a modern twist, then Devotion is the album for you.The instrumentation is stellar, but not clinical -- the musicians know how to let real life breathe through each number, and Rasa member Hans Christian's arrangements and productions are top notch. But the real centerpiece here that takes these traditional tracks to another place is the mesmorizing voice of Kim Waters. She sings in such a breathy, sensual way that one cannot help but stop and listen. Her voice is trancendent and goes down like honey dripping over your soul.The whole album makes for a great relaxing experience, but standouts include Bhajahu Re Mana, Arati, and Ganesha Sharanam. If these tunes fail to move you something is wrong."
5,Beautiful voice and Haunting melodies,"I find Rasa the most beautiful among over one hundred new age CD's I have recently listened. It gently brings you closer in harmony with your self- melodious, balanced and effortless. Could not find more of Kim Waters CD's. Will definitely look forward to more of Hans Christian's similar compositions- Superb."
1,It is aimed at women,This whole book is about how bad guys are and does nothing to tell guys how they need to be. All it says is how bad guys are. Look at the title! Loose that guy. Hmmmm. How many dates has the author had from this book?
5,Great Action Movie!,Loved this movie as a kid and still like it now. Was happy to get it on a DVD. If you like Errol Flynn movies this is a must see.
5,A must see classic film,"I think ""Charge of the Light Brigade,"" with Errol Flynn is among one of finest films, with one of the finest actors of all time. It does have every element. The story is strong and moving, with much heroism and true friendships in it. David Niven and Patrick Knowles are excellent in it as well. The film has a lot of meaning and truth in it, excellent story and acting by all. Olivia de Havilland is a great actress too and very beautiful. No one can match Errol Flynn for swashbuckling , such grace, and really moving and meaningful acting. The romance between Olivia and Major Vickers, is very tender and heartfelt to watch throughout the film. You always wonder how the character she portrayed could have left such a noble and decent man like him for his brother.I'd very highly recommend it. They dont make films like this anymore and that's ashame. It's a rare gem of a film."
2,"For God, Queen and country","This movie is so politically wrong it is a waste of time. There is a more accurate film, title the same, that details the Crimean war. Errol, once again, is the hero."
5,Half a league!,"The Charge of the Light Brigade, even though highly fictionalized, it is still a great adventure movie. Errol Flynn and the other actors give an unforgettable performance."
4,Review on Deuteronomy Scripture and Commentary,"This Collegeville Biblical commentary which includes the actual book of Deuteronomy is excellent for group Bible study. Presently, the group I am with is using the book. The commentary portion is extremely helpful. Many of us say we would not read the Book of Deuteronomy on our own, but with a commentary and the group discussion, we can understand this scripture much better."
4,Nice collection,"I bought this cd because i was a huge hip hop fan and high school and during my time as a hip hop artist Kurtis Blow was a freind of mine. I like all music and this is a quality cd, because its got alot of KB's hits.Best Track on cd: Party TimeWorst: Love Don't Love NobodyIf you ever liked Kurtis Blow, this is a cd to cop."
3,"...it hasn't incited delerium, but, it's still a pretty record","Having read the many insightful comments made regarding Leigh Nash & Fauxliage I'm inclined to add that it makes for a pretty, relaxed, quasi ethereal listen. Rhys & Bill are a bit too understated, but, it's Leigh's record. Frankly, I've gone to programming out the two remix forms of ""Rafe"" and now enjoy the cd more fully. The cover art is lovely, too. It's this listener's recommendation that Fauxliage is best bought at a decent sale price."
5,Deep and reflective and yet somehow inspiring,"I simply cannot believe some of the negative reviews of this CD. One listen only maybe? As the owner of a small world-type music store, the poor stuff stands out pretty quick, as in Oh NO Don't Play THAT again! We play the same CDs over and over again in a week's work. It is very rare I want to buy one myself and listen to it in my car or at home. This one is a winner. Beautiful, often reflective lyrics carried by a beautiful voice and a timeless, spiritual & mysterious kind of 'feel' throughout. Like Joni Mitchell's Don Juan's Reckless Daughter feel (not sound!). Off now to buy a Delirium CD or two, to see if they are worth stocking."
3,disappointed,"This may be a new direction for Delirium and company, but this isn't the sound that drew me to them in the first place. I'll pass this one up!"
5,"Beautiful CD - if you like any of her songs, you'll like them all",Heard one of her songs over and over on my Pandora station so I decided to pick up the CD. What a great choice.
4,A fascinating little journey,"I don't understand popular opinion these days. If musical artists choose to grow more diverse and creative they are criticized for deviating from their trademark sounds. If artists produce new albums with similar discourse they are criticized for not expanding themselves or moving forward. This is not a Delerium Album, obviously. After listening, it's all too apparent. So STFU!!I give this album 4 1/2 stars out of five, simply for the reason that it is a wonderful album albeit a little too short for my tastes. Give it a spin, just don't expect Delerium."
3,dremal lite & magnifer,I WAS SURPRISED THAT THERE WAS NO CLIP TO HOOK IT TO ANYTHING! I JUST NOTICED THAT THE PICTURE SHOWS ONE. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE DUE TO NO WAY TO CONNECT IT TO UNIT. I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER BUT IT WAS PURCHASED ON 1/15/2011MARIE CURTISPINE CITY NY
1,"Warped Lens, Dim Lamp","True, this thing has no clip so it's not as pictured. I'd be calling Dremel to get a replacement, except for its other two fatal flaws.Fatal flaw one is that the LED lamp is so dim as to be almost useless. Even in the sample photos, the light it casts barely shows up there.Fatal flaw two, and far and away the worst, is that the lens is made from a cheap plastic that is warped and doesn't magnify clearly. The magnification varies across the field of view, inconsistently so. The cheap plastic is also prone to scratches and scrapes which, considering what it was designed for, that it would be in the line of chips coming off a rotary tool, was a stupid material choice.A non-fatal flaw is that the batteries are difficult to insert and get positioned correctly.The only good thing I can say is that the gooseneck is of a good quality that holds its position well and stays put as you move the tool around.Not a lot to recommend this."
1,Does not clip - totally useless,"This doesn't come with a clip. You have to buy the clip separately and Amazon doesn't carry it. Nor does anyone else. Nor is it listed anywhere on the dremel website so far as I can find. If you are buying this in order to clip it to anything other than a dremel tool, it will not do that. Buying this is like buying a ceiling fan that doesn't include blades. You see a picture of a ceiling fan with blades but in the product description it says ""Blades not included."" So basically I'm stupid for not reading the entire product description because I thought the TWO pictures shown with the clip being used may actually indicate that the pretty simple product might come with a clip. I guess if you want to mount this on your dremel tool it might work great. If so you can have mine."
5,comfortable and American made,i've owned a similar pair of tan colored anti-fatigue boot socks for the last year. i wore them one to three times a week and washed them after every wearing. they are now looking a little threadbare so i bought a pair of the combat boot overcalf socks (along with a couple more pairs of the tan anti-fatigue boot socks) to replace them. the combat boot socks are two inches longer then the anti-fatigue boot socks but appear to be made out of the same material with the same construction. i'm sure i'll be as happy with these socks as i am with the anti-fatigue boot socks.
4,Thorlo Socks,"I love Thorlo socks, they are the best I've found for my cowboy boots. My only issue has been I wear out the balls and heals quickly (this is my problem not the socks), so I thought I'd try these since the description says ""High-density padding at the heel, ball, and toes provides extra protection against wear and tear on long marches."" Unfortunately now I can't get my cowboy boots on because the socks are too thick. I love the feel and comfort of the socks so I'll just wear them with my work boots."
5,Great Value,"I wore these socks through the worst blizzard I can remember. They are warm and comfy. Boots that used to rub after a few hours can now be worn with all day comfort. My only issue is that I'm at the upper edge of a sock size and they could use an inch to go over the calf, so they sometimes slouch."
3,Not good at wicking sweat,"After getting some blisters on a ruck, I began my search for the perfect pair of boot socks for military use.I've owned Rocky S2V's, Fox River's, Thorlo combat, Wigwam combat, and Smartwool.The Thorlo socks by far offered the most cushion. In fact, they're so thick, they increase my shoe size another half size, both for the running and boot pairs that I own, which can make space tighter. I liked the Thorlos until I found the Smartwools. The smartwools are just slightly thinner, don't bunch up as much and perform a lot better in decreasing sweat. I now only wear smartwool PHD medium cushioned socks, and I'll wear a coolmax liner on longer rucks."
5,TESTED & APPROVED,"Great quality, comfort, and functionality. I will be purchasing additional pairs and fully recommend to others who need a quality boot sock."
4,Comfy but too thick,I bought these socks to wear with my military uniform and combat boots. I have only wore them once they were very comfortable but too thick to wear with my boots. I recommend getting your boots one size bigger if you are going to wear these socks.
1,Boot sock that doesn't stay up,"What is the most important feature of a boot sock? It should stay up. This one does not. It's also too thick, which means it bunches up in the toe after wearing a short time.....and these socks aren't cheap. Never again."
5,Best Boot Sock!!,"As a family, we have all been using Thorlo for well over 10 years, and they are awesome. Comfort and durable = 5 star!!!"
1,Bad for Feet,"I liked the socks, just not when I had to wear them for 14 hours.They do not wick away any moisture away at all. I realised they did bad things to my feet after I removed my boots and saw the wrinkled and pealing mess it had made of my feet. Do not buy these for warm weather at all and make sure to air out feet for long periods even in the cold weather or you will end up with trench foot."
5,Wonderful Socks,I love these socks. They are very comfortable and cozy. I eventually had to order some for girlfriend because she kept stealing mine.
1,Sock is to thick for boot wear,I wear uniform Danner boots everyday at work. I needed a sock that is comfortable for this type of wear. This sock is extremely thick and made my normally comfortable boots hot and uncomfortable.
4,An exciting recording,"This is an exciting recording by multiple readers. Some poems are recited by Boris Karloff, who is best known from the film version of Frankenstein. Karloff is the stand-out in the group. Other more recent speakers do well also. Recommended."
4,Excelente grupo,This is an amazing Mexican band playing their best songs for the MTV unplugged. It is a masterpiece. I will totally recommend this product and the seller.
5,This is Classic Swing,"More great Big Band Swing from Bill Elliott. He is the Glen Miller of our era. Great originals like Swingin' the Century and Camp Hollywood Special really cook. Some good vocal songs-- like The Shim Sham Song and When we Dance. This is toe tapping music. Like the first two CD's this also have some classic covers Oh Lady Be Good , Jeep Jockey Jump, and Blues In the Night. This is a must to bring in the New Century!!"
5,Janez Detd rocks!!!!,"I'm a big fan of this cd! There melodic rock is awesome, they have cool lyrics (especialy if you know they'are from Belgium, so English isn't there first language)and there guitar player plays really great.I saw them at an Offsping concert,and they're live even better. I don't know which bands they compare with, maybe The Offspring, but they still sound different. They arejust really cool and I think everyone who likes the punkrock stuff, likes Janez Detd.(or not, but I do)"
3,Veggie Fun But Lacking,"This VeggieTales CD contains songs from The Ballad of Little Joe, A Snoodle's Tale, and An Easter Carol. This collection of songs is not as good as previous editions only because of the VeggieTales episodes that make up the collection. A Snoodle's Tale was cute but only two songs (""I Want To Dance"" and ""Sports Utility Vehicle"") come from that episode. An Easter Carol was ok but the beautiful ""A Hope's Song"" and funny ""Boids"" makes up for what is an otherwise lackluster collection of songs from that show. The songs from The Ballad of Little Joe are easily the highlight of the collection but I find it completely baffling that the Silly Songs With Larry song from that episode, ""Bellybutton"", was not included! Little Joe is one of the best VeggieTale episodes and ""Bellybutton"" is the highlight. I don't understand how it could be left out. Had it been included, with possibly a remix version, this CD would easily have rated 4 or 5 stars."
2,Island moan,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge David & Diane Arkenstone collector. Unfortunately, this recording seems to be a favor for a friend who wanted some island music, man. Moan. Certainly not up to David's composing skills or orchestrations. Pass on this one, but look into others in the series, like Ocean Dreams. Much better."
2,hammock music,"If your looking for something soothing while laying in a hammock, this is the one. I'm a bit more hyper and need something that doesn't cause me to yawn so much. I've got most all Arkenstone has ever done, including under other names. I'm probably not going to buy his next CD because of my disappointment with this one. Most of his music, I still like a lot and he still remains one of my top 5 favorites, along with Chris Spheeris, Alan Parson, Ian Anderson and Steve Hackett, former guitarist of Genesis."
3,Sarcastic but uplifting!,"This CD is pretty funny. Mamed Con Dancehall is a fun Samba and then you go into an player testimonial in a funny tune ""Date With Baby"". Then there's a look at rich yuppie life in ""I Got Cash"" and on the CD goes from Jazz to Salsa to R&B to Ska to Hip Hop and so forth. It's a fun CD but some of their older stuff was more serious."
2,What Happen To The Funk?,"I grew up with funk, and this is not it! Sounds more like neo-raggae. Good musicians, but this is NOT funk! They need to change the band's name."
2,Don't be fooled,"I dont own this but my relitives do. It is absoloutely terrible. They say it is 50 inches long. Now take a good look at that picture. I dont know about you but that looks like a 20yr old who's torso barely fits on the board. It is increadibly small and WAY overpriced. your legs hang off the back even when your head is dangleing off the front ready to slam into whatever is in front of you. there is no steering, it breaks way too easily and is an eyesoar. Sure its somewhat fast but is ismply not worth 112 dollars, more like $30. Just stick to the cheap and replaceable foam boards, much easier to repair and WAY bigger."
2,Two Stars is enough,"The value of this movie relies on the creativity of some scenes. the surreal touch of them. Something already seen many times but, with a certain unique touch. The body of the film however lacks shape. It's argument is weak and takes the viewer nowhere. It reminds me of a Dada poem where the poem is created by throwing words on the table and arranging them by chance. Just like the magnets now sold for the refrigerators."
2,Not very satisfying...,"I didn't like this movie primarily because it does not offer a lot of message to its viewers. Aside that it does not offer a visual feast in its production design and cinematography, the storyline is a bit poor and does not offer a lot of hype for the audience to ponder about after the movie. The movie is quite simple, a drummer who is trying to figure out his past, by going back to his mother's hometown. There wasn't even something to look forward to in the ending. You just simply wanted the movie to end.One thing that disappoints me further is that I'm expecting quite some catchy tunes provided as its soundtrack, but it turns out that even the music used for the score is really poor. It's a plain plain movie. Watch it if you have nothing else to do."
1,oh there is a way out!,"I purchaes this book on the strength of reading and meeting Darren Coleman on his first time out. But, let me tell you. I have read a many books. But his make believe nonsense, with no realistic pages. Was a mess. I couldn't even finish reading the book. Money and Dee are from my neighborhood. And both of them are on a slab on the Grounds of DC General Hospital.They died dreaming just like you. However your imagination is greater. You never lived in the ghetto, and the person who told you about it lied.this is not the game. IN NOBODY'S 1405. The only thing I got was a winning lottery # 1405. I boxed it 1504.Trashed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I won't come again."
4,nice book to read,THIS BOOK WAS O.K. I GIVE IT A 4 STAR BECAUSE I LIKE THE END OF THE BOOK . I WOULDNT SAY RUN OUT A GET IT. THE AUTHOR MADE YOU READ THE BOOK ALL THE WAY AND THEN GIVE YOU THE GOOD THING AT THE END NOTHING IN MIDDLE. BUT IT WAS OK IF YOU LKIE A LOT OF STREET BOOKS.
1,did not work,"did not work on my cats?? wonder if it is fake product?? i did research and found a lot of people complaining about pirate products, - be careful with what you put on your kitties!"
2,Generic Version of Cartridge,Thought I was buying an Everpure H-100 Water filter cartridge but was shipped a generic version of cartridge instead. I don't know if this was intentional but recommend seller make correction on Amazon Website that it is a generic of the filter. I could have bought same filter cheaper on-line at AquaPurefilters.com. Very frustrating purchase.
1,Worst Thing to ever Happen to Sonic!,"Sonic is supposed to be lighthearted, fun and exciting(like the games), not dark, mature,and serious! This is not Sonic's Style at all. I hate DiC! don't buy this!"
1,Don't even think about it!,this is completely different from the style of the games. its not good for people who are new to sonic. it can corrupt them into thinking this is sonic. i hate it all! i hate everything about this show.
5,"Old Sonic, Good Quality","Sure the shows are old and you never see them anymore, but this was the beginning. Based on the comics, it shows how the Freedom Fighters and Robotnik clashed. Anyway, this video has two episodes. First, the freedom fighters take out Robotnik's main generator only to find he has a back-up one also. So Robotnik creates a speedy machine and challenges Sonic to a race. On the second, the freedom fighters break in once more, but Sally finds a message from her father he left for her. Watch the video to find out what happens."
1,I WANT BETTER!!,"This movie dissapointed me very much. I know some people who have seen this series would disagree,but come on the storys the same all the time. Robotnik is always trying to get Sonic but he gets away. BORING! I mean wheres Tails and knuckles and all those guys? At least the new series Sonic X has them, and the plot's different everytime to. I think Sonic has gotten much better. Sonic X rules!!"
1,stung 5 times,Between me and my grandaughter we have tried to order this item five times and each time at the last moment the supplier drops the key word in the title. This completely changes the CD. We are trying to obtain Endless Love [Intersound] but each time they drop [Intersound]. I guess by now I have learned my lesson.Maybe there's somebody out there that can help us.
4,"Subtle, Articulate Chamber Free-Jazz","The review below is, um, not very helpful. ""Still Light"" is not remotely like any album Miles ever made, with the exception of George Russell's great ""Odjenar"" -- and it's certainly nothing like ""Live at the Plugged Nickel""!This is a moody, mysterious album of what you might call ""chamber free-jazz"" -- there is a lot of space in the music, and few melodic hooks to speak of, but a brooding and quite lovely vibe is sustained throughout. Stately trumpet lines arc out of the silence, cymbals and gongs ebb into plucked guitar and bass strings, and the atmosphere is one of quiet inquiry. It's slightly dissonant in parts, lyrical in others, ""serious"" and inward. Not for everyone, but if your idea of a good time is, say, the Art Ensemble of Chicago's ""People in Sorrow,"" it may be for you. I like it."
1,Euro-Miles,"Mostly a rip-off of Miles Davis. Listen to the samples. Money would be better spent on the real (and vastly superior) thing, like Miles' ""Live at the Plugged Nickel."""
1,Worst book I ever read,"After forcing myself through 300+ pages, I had to let others know how boring this book was. If you're looking for action, combat, courage under fire, etc., this book's got about 30 pages of it. The rest is all about his everyday life, written in excruciatingly boring detail. He takes pages to describe the school bus schedule for his kids, his wife's interest in sewing clubs, and other boring household stuff like that. He spends more time describing his efforts at manipulating and getting around the system to keep his family on Okinawa then on military action. He doesn't describe SF training, openly complains about having to return for his tours in 'Nam, and complains about just about everything else. In comparison with other great books about combat, such as James Watson's ""Point Man,"" this is a real dud. If the choice was available, I'd have rated it 0 stars."
2,Not what you might expect,"Sounds like my miserable Uncle relating his military career. The first 90 pages deals with 4, count em, 4 illnesses Craig contracted during his early Nam years. Very little of the book deals with any actual Vietnam experiences, and what is described, is actually quite boring. A resume of Craig reaching Sgt Major is not what I had in mind nor in yours, if what you're expecting is at least a minimal personal narrative of Special Force experiences."
3,Herman Wouk novel,Memories of the necessity of living one way in the outside world and another way in the Jewish community.It includes some nostalgic and some humorous vingnettes. It was a bit too long in my opinion.
5,from the back cover of the book,"Fascinating, funny, romantic, wise... This is a stunning exploration of the American Jewish experience - the heartfelt tale of every immigrant torn between the culture of his forefathers and the glorious temptations of a new land's dream. - A grand piece of storytelling-Boston Globe. Rich and compelling-The New York Times. Laugh until your side aches...Wipe away a tear...-Pittsburgh Press"
2,"Great Info, Horrible Editing/Format","The title says it all. The information is this book is great, but I would say not to bother with the Kindle version, and go for the paperback. The editing will be the same in both (bad transitions, etc), but the format will be better. His lists and even chapter headings, are not well formatted for Kindle. Also you cannot choose a chapter/table of contents in ""Go to"" you just have to page through the whole book if you want to go back to something. Shame on whoever transitioned this to Kindle. It's worth a few bucks for the information, but I'm returning it to get the paperback version, to have the information in a usable manner (for reference)."
2,Might be something to it but...,"Somewhat disappointing. Goes into detail about how our diet affects us etc. All well and good. But as for a practical realistic option, maybe for some people but not for us. Basically this book is saying that everything my son eats (and I mean everything!) is bad with a capital 'B'. There is literally nothing my son eats that is acceptable according to this book. Everything that he ""should"" be eating...well let's just say he'd starve.This book does provide an alternative to medication, and I think there is merit to it. But for our family it ain't gonna happen."
5,A natural solution to ADHD that makes sense,"If the pharmaceutical industry sends a ""hit man"" after Dr. Bob DeMaria, it shouldn't be a shock. That's because ""Dr. Bob's Guide to Stop ADHD in 18 Days"" will be devastating to the sales of Ritalin and other psychoactive drugs if enough people read the book. In addition to giving valuable advice about healthy eating (and how to avoid hyperactivity-inducing substances like sugar and trans fat), Dr. DeMaria provides some insightful wisdom about how parents can communicate better with their children in the process of resolving their ADHD situation. I especially applaud this book for the way it backs up its assertions and its solutions with scientific evidence as well as common sense. So...whether the pharmaceutical companies like it or not, Dr.DeMaria has provided understandable guidelines for combating ADHD without drugs."
5,A life changing book,This book has changed our families health. We have a two and five year old. The nutritional information in this book has changed the way our family eats and lives. We see a huge difference in our childrens behavior. This book is easy to read and to follow. It should be on every parents shelf as a guide.
5,Excellent book for the whole family,"This book gives a great amount of information, not only for ADD etc. patients, but also is a great guide to family health in general. It really opened my eyes to the dangerous eating habits we all encounter. Thanks Dr. DeMaria"
1,Perhaps the worst sports book ever written,MY GAWD! This is a horrid book and it seems the author spent two hours banging it out on his old Commodore 64 computer. You should be able to sue for pain and suffering after reading this snoozer. How did it even get published?
1,I I I I,"Having looked at the first few pages of his book at the Trop, I noticed that there were a lot of I's(No ego here) The clerk there said they had sold 3 or 4 copies so I guess others are of the same opinion as I"
1,Wrong CD,"I received my order, but they put the wrong cd in the latest thing jewel case...they sent the self titled cd...it is in the wrong case...this would be fine but I ordered the self titled cd and it should arrive tomorrow, so I will now have 2 copies of that album, if they won't correct it for me."
3,No Fret-less? Don't Fret...,"well, i hope it grows on me. now, don't get me wrong. it's not a 'bad' record. i just really had my hopes up that it would surpass 97's self-titled record. but, sadly, it doesn't. still, they're a quality band.zac maloy is a terrific singer, and the instrumentation is, as always, inventive and exciting. but it just lacked a little bit. money, i bet. there's got to be quite a step down from MCA to Koch. after losing their contract amidst the massive Universal restructure/merger/ballyhoo, the nixons, in my opinion, have shown their mettle here by sticking around, refusing to be a casualty in the record company genocide. one track that touches on this is 'blackout', where the bitterness is ovbious.well, here's hoping the next record (my fingers are crossed) will sate me. thank you, nixons, for sticking around, and here's hoping you have the facilities, support, and promotion worthy a band of your quality."
1,Bogus product,Only reason I did not return this was because Amazon only gives back 50% of the money for opened DVD.There is nothing about Web service in the DVD's. It only talks about servlets and JSP's.The DVD quality is very poor. Editing and sound are bad.The content of the DVD are way off the title on the DVD.People look at the title and description to buy the DVD.
4,Got the wrong color,"It's a good watch so far. I got it as a gift for a friend, but they sent me a model with a silver-colored face/background, instead of the one pictured here with the black face. I would have preferred the black background, but oh well. My friend is happy with it so far..."
3,Escape!,"My pet hamster and kept getting out of the side s because of the little caps. Some hamsters can climb out the top if it isnt latched very well. The cage is fine if you get extentions and make sure that you have the top latched, but over all, it isnt worth aas much as you pay for it"
1,Hi,"It's been said practice does not come from theory, but theory from practice.I have from a good source what these big volumes really are - they are *private* notes taken from meetings of people learning a practical system by direct oral transmission. So, what's missing in reading these nice-looking books is the context they depend on: the individuals, their situations, and what they were learning at that time (re: a vast system contained in no book.) Since unfortnately no-one can bridge those three big gaps with pure theorizing, the lone reader may get quite confused by these lectures - almost as a faintly heard conversation one overhears and then tragically misinterprets. At least, don't be too sure! You can see the problem.In summary, the Commentaries may have less value to readers than certain works like NEW MAN and LIVING TIME or for that matter Ouspensky's NEW MODEL and TERTIUM ORGANUM."
1,i have only read 5 pages,"from 1145 to 1149 where is commentary on small and large accumulators and from that i know that mr. nicolls books are probably waste of money. go, look at these pages and you'll see for yourself"
5,Foundational Teachings for personal Introspection and Growth that is free of imagination,"Psychological Commentaries takes one back to a time where Science and Spirit were viewed as one and the same...as it still is yet unrecognized by most of world.Be prepared to have all that one has ""Learned"" and ""Believed"" to be absolutely turned upside down and most importantly turned inside out..."
4,very useful if you understand its background,"Like most of those interested in Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, Nicholl was the type of person who looks toward spiritual ""masters"" and their systems to do his thinking for him, and as a result some of what he has to say is only derivative, old-fashioned occultish nonsense. If you can wade through the occasional mudhole of that sort of thing (and who among us interested in so-called spiritual literature hasn't had to learn to do so), his humility, common sense and basic decency shine through in every page of these five volumes. It is this that gives him his often penetrating insight into human nature; the fourth way/Christian conceptual system he frames it in is ultimately only a hindrance. While he owes much to The System as a writer, where he succeeds as a mystic he succeeds despite it, not because of it."
1,Do not buy from Etronics,"I received a damaged product from this company. The mixer appears new, but the cd players had scratches on them, and one of them did not read any of the cds while the other cd player read each of the cds placed in the first. The cd players appeared used, and one was definitely damaged. I rated this purchase one-star, only because I couldn't give it zero.A very dissapointed customer."
1,perpetuating a myth,"How sad that children are being taught fiction as though it was history. Quilts were not made as maps to help slaves escape to Canada; many people risked their lives to help slaves get to Canada and freedom. Those people, both black and white, are the real heroes!It's very sad that this myth continues.Quilts, though warm and lovely, don't need to be brought into the equation."
5,Great Social Studies Link for Teachers,"In an inviting tale, this book links the concept of maps to slaves running away from plantations. I plan to use it with my students. Important note: discuss which parts of the tale are fictitious (possibly quilt use to create a map) and which parts are factual (underground railroad, using covert means to communicate how to escape, etc.)."
4,A great oven mitt.,"This is the oven mitt that is a best buy from Cook's Illustrated. I ordered several, as shipping is a bit much when the item is less than $5. The color is what it is....a sort of muddy grey. But, it works like a chamr. It is a little long for my arms, hitting into the elbow bend, but you can't beat it for the price."
4,Great quartet leads -- in one place.,"Yes, you can hear the great R.H. Harris and the Soul Stirrers, Claude Jeter and the Swan Silvertones (unearthly in the beauty of their singing), the Pilgrim Travelers, and the house-wrecking Archie Brownlee and his Five Blind Boys of Mississippi AND Julius Cheeks' Sensational Nightingales tear things up in this mostly a cappella set. For quartet fans, an essential anthology -- and introduction to mind-blowing singing."
2,Good Music - Bad Master,"While the vocal performances on this disc are great, I was very disappointed in the noise level. I felt like I was listening to vinyl that had been stored outside the dust jacket for several years.I was quite fooled by the real-audio clips that can be downloaded. They sound better than the CD because the compression managed to filter out most of the noise."
1,How did they go from Oracle to this?,"I hated the death metal vocals that made up Oracle, and I hate the wimpy sound that makes up this album. I thought Until the End got a little bit softer than Kittie's norm, but was still enjoyable. This album on the other hand is just too emo. I'm glad they got back on track with In The Black."
3,Anyone else think this one's a little weak?,"I have all of Kittie's CD's and listen to them regularly...except for this one. It just seems a little too Pop to me. We don't even get a song with some good throat until track 6. I still like the band, there's just so much contrast between FfY and Oracle that it's hard to believe it's the same band. Well technically it's only half of that band. Anyone watch the DVD? I don't think they know that Dimebag is dead."
4,Kittie rules!!,"Im Kittie Fan, even I like this CD (and the DVD) I think is a little more comercial and easier to hear, Im still thinking Lander sisters rules, if you are begining in the Speed metal you could begin with ""Funeral For yesterday"" and ""in to the Darkness"" (previous CD)"
3,"Great music, but DRM means no computer play","I loved the music on all of this, but somebody decided I shouldn't be able to play the disc on my computer or convert the disc for my mp3 player. I wouldn't mind so much if there was a notice of this restriction. To call this a compact disc (and it's not since it doesn't adhere to the standard) is false advertising and my only real knock about the release.Get me one I can rip to mp3 and I'd make that a 5 star rating."
3,Not the same Kittie,"If you like Spit, Oracle, and Until the End, beware. This is not the same band. Kittie used to be a throwback metal band, the coolest all-girl TRUE metal band ever. With the new guitarist and bassist they have become an alternative NU-metal band. They sound clean and crisp and belong on the radio. The songs aren't bad, and it's not a bad album. There is a lot more ""singing"" and a lot less shouting, which I do not consider a good thing. But it's the fact that they have become alternative-metal instead of traditional metal which is the most disappointing."
3,Not my favorite....,"It's still better than spit, and I'm a big kittie fan. I've been listening to them since the beginning. This song evolves them to a sound much more poppy than anything they've done before. There's some good tracks, but I'd rather listen to Oracle any day.If you're looking for something heavy, look elsewhere, this one sounds like it could be a donnas record....There are a few good tracks on this album though, Breathe, Never Again, Witch hunt, Flower of flesh and blood...."
5,BAD LANDS JUSTICE,ALEX MCARTHUR MADE SEVERAL OF THESE MOVIES FOR TELEVISION AND THEY WERE ALL VERY GOOD WESTERNS. FOR ANY WESTERN MOVIE FAN THEY ARE REALLY GOOD IN MY OPINION. I AM 70 YEARS OLD AND BELIEVE ME WHEN I WAS A KID I SAW PLENTY OF CLASS B WESTERNS AND THIS IS DEFINATLY A CLASS A ACT. THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE OF THESE MOVIES MADE FOR TELEVISION AND I WOULD LIKE TO FIND ALL OF THEM.
2,Nice album.... mastered from vinyl,"This is quite a nice album. Tasteful playing from Davey and all those present at the sessions. Unfortunately, the album is mastered from vinyl source material. It's pretty clean vinyl, but there is distracting sound in spots."
5,boat puget sound,"With this book at your helm, you'll navigate Puget Sound with confidence. A beautiful, accurate, indispensable guide.The other reviewers say it all -- This is a fine cruisng guide.Wayne Heinz, author of, How to Catch Salmon, Sturgeon, Lingcod, Rockfish, and Halibut Along the Pacific Coast: Fish On!"
4,A Comprehensive & Well Written Guide,"This book is very comprehensive and well written. I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it to be an invaluable asset in planning my charter of the Puget Sound and San Juan Islands.The information is well presented, easy to navigate, and up to date. I highly recommend this book."
4,Great starter book for the Puget Sound,"Well write, easy to follow maps with semi detailed pictures/charts. Great starter book for a friend new to the area. Would recommend as a lite reading and sailing but not a replacement for good chart."
5,must have,This is an excellent cruising guide for the west coat cruising waters. It is my bible when out & about cruising. I have used it since it first came out. Side note: even had the author sign it after a lecture she gave one year. Very worthwhile to add to your boating library.
5,The best cruising Guide for the Puget Sound,"The information is well-presented, the writing superior, and the format superior to the other, best-selling book on the area (a copy of which I also have). Migael concentrates on the Puget Sound and US ports, and writes from an insider's point of view. The graphics and marina descriptions are great."
1,Bugsy by James Toback,"When I ordered ""Bugsy"" by James Toback I was NOT expecting the screenplay version...nor should I have received that as that was not made clear in the advertisement. Is the regular paperback of this book available anywhere? I previously read the book so I know it exists, and in paperback version."
5,Stand by Me,"This CD is worth buying if for only one song, ""Stand by Me"". This is the best a cappella harmony you'll ever hear."
2,not the same wiithout 'Jerry Trammel',After going through the many samples of Florida Boys music I can say I only wished that Jerry Trammel (the best Tenor)singer the 'Florida Boys' in my views ever had was still with this group.If you have a 'Florida Boys' album with Jerry on it then you have a real masterpeace of music
3,tranzworld 3 review,"i'm rating tranzworld 3 three stars, because it's suprisingly not as good as tranzworld 1, or 2... the music is generally more upbeat, but like i said, if you haven't heard either tranzworld 1, or tranzworld 2, you should buy one of those instead."
5,Excellent discourse on Tibetan Buddhist philosophy,These videos provide an excellent insight into both the philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism as well as a great introduction to the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader and as a regular person. I really enjoyed it. Real food for thought!!
5,My time is better spent....,"....watching the Dalai Lama explain the Four Noble Truths on my iPad than some lame movie while on an airplane for 5 hours. The introduction by Robert A.F. Thurman is a wonderful concise explanation of what is ahead. His Holiness speaks some personal comments in English but then switches to Tibetan when explaining the philosophy and thought behind The Four Nobel Truths (with his long-time interpreter on stage with him). You should, I think, have a basic knowledge of the story of the Buddha before watching this as it will help understanding the thought behind The Four Noble Truths. Wonderful listening to and seeing the His Holiness the Dalai Lama, very comforting."
5,Great kid movie,My grandson has fallen in love with Jay Jay. It is nice to be able to get him more dvd's.
3,Tolerable: 3 1/2 stars,"Most Christmas albums aren't worth your time, but this album from Toni Braxton is actually pretty listenable and is way better than her last album, The Heat. Though corny lyrics and weird song titles are still in abundance (""Christmas in Jamaica"" and ""Snowflakes of Love"", whatever that means), she gives a great performance on the Charlie Brown Christmas ode, ""Christmas Time is Here"". This album is supposed to be all new material, but the very old song, ""The Christmas Song"" (from Laface Records' 1993 Christmas album), also appears on here. Why?"
2,Not quite sure about this one,"If I were brutally honest I would say that I was not at all impressed with this album. Don't get me wrong, I love Toni Braxton and will continue to listen to her music but I couldn't get into this album at all. Christmas in Jamaica was nice - I can just picture the video. She appeared to mumble her way through the rest of the songs and you couldn't really hear her vocal range - which is impressive. I thought it was strange that ""Christmas in Jamaica"" appeared twice, it was wrong type of song to end the album.Who knows, the songs may grow on me"
4,"Braxton does better on the ""classics""","Rummaging through the ""holiday bin"" at the local Wal-Mart, I came across the two-year-old album. Intending to purchase it upon its initial release, I allowed two Christmases to pass me by. But, I'm glad that I ""found"" it prior to the start of the 2003 holiday season.While it's not quite up to five-star status, the album does offer its pleasantries. Braxton fares better on interpretations of ""Christmas Time is Here"", ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" (a can't-miss tune), and ""The Christmas Song"". Of the original tracks, the best is ""Snowflakes of Love,"" penned by Braxton, Kerri Lewis, and the music of Isaac Hayes. The song is presented twice, a vocal version and an instrumental one.The throwaway, also offered twice, is ""Christmas in Jamaica"". Obviously geared for the younger audience, it is totally out of place and has the distinction of a rather awkward performance by guest ""artist"" Shaggy."
3,Good Mood Setter to wet your Toni appetite,"Toni is back with christmas cheer! So you knwow any new TOni CD will be bought by me, Tonis biggest fan! I am a FANATIC. Well, I am a fan with a mind and I listen carefully to songs. I have to say I like christmas in Jamacia, but have you noticed that the colume gets unusually loud for that song? I liked the beat to Santa please and the orchestra. Her voice is so diva, it is operatic. I also really liked chirstmas time is here. I did skip over the other songs, but that was because they were more predictable. But if you want to have some real fun, check out her DVD! Now that is 5 stars!"
3,Not worth that price!,"I pick this CD because all tracks are easy to listening. For only 7 songs including 3 traditional christmas song, this CD absolutely not worth for $...P>I like Snowflakes of Love and Christmas Time is here."
3,Disappointing,"As a diehard Toni Braxton fan, I was disappointed with this CD. That strong, bold voice of hers was missing !!! Holiday Celebrate, Snowflakes of Love, and This Time Next Year are reminiscent of the slammin' Boomerang soundtrack, but throwing in Shaggy, please Toni, you can do better."
3,Dissapointing!,"This CD is a dissapointment to me. It does not have very many of the much-loved classics on it, most of this cd is crappy, second rate album filler christmas music. With all the Christmas classics out there, I am not quite sure why Toni felt the need to put so much junk filler music on it. A waste of $15 if you ask me! Some of the songs are a little bit overdone as well."
5,Toni shines with her snowflakes,"Toni's xmas album is one of the best albums in its type.Full of beautiful melodies transcending from classical songs like ""have yourself a merry xmas"" to the modern duet with shaggy ""xmas in jamaica"" we find a very mature voice,Toni definetely knows how to use her vocals perfectly as she brings the words to life as in the case of ""snowflakes of love"".""holiday celebrate"" as well is a total work of art having her sister Tamar on the background vocals.So if you are looking to make your xmas a little more original please buy a copy of this album i swear it's worth the money!"
1,Qty Order,"I purchased these aqua glow lantern thinking I was getting 2 per $14.95 and I'm sure that is the way it was adversited when I purchased them. I order 7 units which should have been 14 lanterns, but only recieved 6 out the 14 I thought I was getting. These lanterns can be purchased much cheaper from another company. Also, I did only recieve 6 out 7 lanterns even thought it stated they were in stock and even shows it now when I came back into complete a review. This vendor is not trustworthy and I can't even call to tell them that I don't want the missing 7th lantern since it can't be here in time. Bad choice to use this company."
1,terrible quality,I have ordered three of these and two of them started to leak water inside the first time I had used them--- not a good thing in a salt water pool... it got all rusty and I had to trash both lanterns
3,Snake Starter Kit Review,"The Snake Starter Kit comes with a log cave, a water dish, bedding, two sample size packets of water purifier and hand sanitizer, a thermometer and a small heating pad (for 10-20 gallon tanks).The log cave, the heating pad, and the thermometer are being used in my 35 gallon tank, and I use the water purifier and hand sanitizer on a regular basis. These items work great for my reptiles (I have 3 corn snakes and one leopard gecko!) The bedding I ended up giving away to another reptile owner, and he has found that this bedding is rather dry for a reptile, and soaks up all the humidity in the tank.Most of the items in my tank are ZooMed products, and work great, although I have had them in use for a little less than a month. This is a great package for anyone starting out as a reptile owner, although you may want to consider a different substrate to use. I recommend:Zoo Med Eco Earth Compressed Coconut Fiber Expandable Substrate."
4,Cute,"Stella and her little brother Sam go to play in the forest. Sam has a lot of fears, but Stella, who is a know-it-all, dismisses them by reassuring Sam that bears sleep during the day, and snakes are too small to swallow people. The story is cute, but not always accurate. It has about 600 words."
4,I'm becoming a real fan of the Stella books,"They're very sweet, in a way that isn't too adult-geared to appeal to kids.In this one, Stella and Sam venture (alone! it's a bit free-range, which may thrill or terrify you) into the woods, with Sam asking lots of cautious questions and Stella offering confident - if somewhat inaccurate - answers. But even in their inaccuracies they're good answers."
2,"Loved the first one, but this one doesn't hold a candle.","I loved Stella Star of the Sea. The illustrations with that flaming red hair and subtly comic dog, Sam's conservative and inquisitive nature. Stella Queen of the Snow was okay, but didn't have the same uniqueness. The dialogue seemed a bit forced and not as charming as the first. I am sadly disappointed with Stella Fairy of the Forest. It doesn't have any of the wonderful qualities of the Star of the Sea."
2,Not Enough Mighty Mouse,"Good Cartoons but it was purchased especially for mighty mouse. Had only 1 MM cartoon, kind of disappointing."
3,Average Underground Hip-Hop,"I feel Jazz Addixx can rhyme, but the beats on here just sound repetitive and after awhile, they kind of all just melt into one long boring album.Don't get me wrong though, there is definetely good rap on here though, as lyrically Jazz Adixx sound superior to most cats in the mainstream latelly.Buy this album if you like smooth laid back underground rap, with, needless to say, alot of jazz influence"
3,Sarah Bernhardt remains evasive,"While Ms. Richardson has given us a good overview of Bernhardt's life, she never quite gets below the surface of what made her the unique actress she was. She mentions that the French audiences became quite cool toward her but never bothers to epxlain that Zola and Baudelaire had brought realism to literature and the theater of that time and that Mme. Sarah's grand way of acting and declaming was out of style. She mentions the personalities who peopled Bernhardt's world but, for readers unfamiliar with French art and literature, it is never explained what place they occupied. There are several quotations in French but no translation is supplied. The illustrations are marvelous but take up too much of the book - more detailed text would be appreciated."
2,very sloppily edited,"Mistakes galore-i.e. in one recipe 5 ounces of sliced wild mushrooms makes 2 cups and in another 1/4 pounds(sic) makes 8 cups. The recipe for veal glace is given as page 000, indicates that the vein can be pulled from a cooked shrimp and so it goes."
5,One of my favorites,"I own lots of cookbooks (over 200) and the White Dog Cafe cookbook is one of my favorites. I have tried about half of the book's recipes and have never been disappointed. The recipes are interesting, using ingredients that non-professionals can find easily. The techniques are easy and the food is very tasty. The food is also creative and can be made (even for the first time)without a household staff of 12! The White Dog Cafe's Black Bean Soup is the only version I really like and I have made it several times. The social philosophy of the authors is an added bonus."
3,White Dog Cafe cookbook,"Not very enlightening, frankly. Division of book is the usual soup to desserts (thought it would reflect different cultures). The Caesar salad without the egg had nothing to replace the egg. Print so small and bookbinding difficult to keep open without a bookholder."
5,Great book; simple story line and wonderful introduction to changing seasons for toddlers and preschoolers.,I love this book. The story line is simple and the illustrations are a wonderful complement. The book can be used to teach very young children about the changing seasons.
1,The taste is a bit off,"I have a very nice collection of balsamic vinegars from very cheap ones to an incredibly pricey one ($150 for a small bottle) given to me by my sisters who visited Italy.Frankly, this is one I'll probably just toss out. The really cheap ones have a better tartness, and of the ones in this price range, this is my least favorite. Actually tastes a little chemically.Ugh!"
1,NONE FOR ME,"This was only a portion of the movie, Also it was very hard to see. I thought I was getting the whole movie and threw it away."
1,"Title Is Misleading, This is NOT the MOVIE",The title is misleading making you think you are ordering the full movie. I ordered the full movie and I get this short film. Not worth the money that's for sure.
1,I was duped,I have never heard of the so called directors cuts being sold like this so I was surprised and disappointed when I did not get the full movie as that is what I was ordering. (I thought) It should be made very plain to people looking at the website the difference in the 2 available movies. I feel duped.
2,didnt know there were two,I did not know that there were two movies about the same thing.I was very unhappy as I was trying to replace my copy of Sling Blade. The review that I read did not state that there were two movies with similar names.
1,Some Folks Call it a Sling Blade,"I was very dissappointed in this movie. But it was my fault. I ordered the wrong one. I meant to order Sling Blade, which I later did."
1,Not what I was lookng for!,"I was pleased with the transaction. It came when promised & in excellent condition. Although it was not what I thought it was, due to my own misunderstanding."
1,some folks call it a sling bad,i bought this tape thinking that it was more of a story but it was a repete of the first few mins of the original movie i was very disappointed don't spend your money on this
4,Should have been an added bonus to the movie DVD,"Should have been an added bonus to the movie DVD, not a seperate DVD. Not really worth buying as it is almost the identical dialogue from the movie, except in black and white. This original short is interesting, maybe worth renting, but I think it should have been put on the movie's DVD as a bonus feature..."
5,"if you enjoyed the movie, this short gives insight","when i saw 'slingblade' for the first time, i was totally knocked out. i wondered how one man, b.b. thorton, could put together a film that is so multi-faceted. having grown up in the midwest, everything about the movie struck a chord in me and when i found that this short was available, i grabbed it! it is well worth the price and will give you some insight as to how thorton created the character of karl childers. highly recommended!"
4,Simply Super Blues,"This album is especially dear because Renee Austin is unable to sing due to problems with her vocal chords. Her voice is truly an instrument that she has mastered. On Sweet Talk she demonstrates a wide range of emotions, from slow and easy to get up and dance! She has a unique style that keeps the listener wanting more. The tracks make you think of relationships in a new way. Especially on the tracks she authored, the lyrics are surprising; the listener hums along and thinks--Wow! never thought of that! Her band is a great fit for this sassy singer."
5,A wonderful surprise!,"When I ordered this book I thought I was buying an exposé about life at Ciro's in it's heyday, with emphasis on celebrities. Light summer reading, you know.. But this book is not about that and I could not have been more surprised or pleased. Sheila Weller's experiences as an adolescent trying to fit in with the Popular Girls rings so true that I felt like I was in Junior High again, only with her. The painful stories she relates about her family, especially about her father, made me think she must be a wonderfully strong woman to be able to write with such honesty. And with a wry sense of humor threaded throughout, even in the painful parts of her story. I highly recommend this book and look forward to more from this author."
5,Great Resource,So happy to have this resource in researching family history. Made a great gift for the entire family! Thank you!
4,Almost as good as Ray Bradbury,"I am a huge fan of short stories. Aimee Bender has a talent for creating wonderful characters who, at times, are extroadinarily insightful. My favorite short story in this book (I forget the title) was about the pumpkin headed family who had one child with an iron head. I have often wondered how I would deal with such a depressing situation (will not give this situation away). At the end of the story the pumpkin mother is in the kitchen cooking and is reflecting on her loss. She has such a great line for why she must carry on. I highly suggest all parents read this lovely, heartwrenching story.All the short stories in this book are worth reading but some are better than others. My favorite author is Ray Bradbury and Aimee Bender shares his style. I hope she continues to create more fascinating short stories."
5,.,"Aimee Bender is mostly likely the best writer ever born. Sometimes she sucks and sometimes she is amazing and sometimes she is inbetween, this is one of the latter, but even her inbetweens are better than other people's bests."
4,Poetry in Proseful Motion,"Ignore the impossible run-on sentences and each small tale with captivate you with a symphony of human emotions. Despite some of the obvious illogical ideas, the feelings expressed are still true.This is a light read, broken up into stories small enough to focus on while waiting in a long line or riding the bus, and yet once you fall into the fairy-tale, you won't want to stop reading and go back to the ordinary world.These stories are like mirrors, some will taunt you with feelings you don't quite understand fully and some will cause you to experience too much. A must read, an even better must-giveaway."
4,"Willful yes, but so very very odd","Bender's series of short stories knead out will to the very edges of humanity with her disarmingly charming and beloved ""creatures"" that include potato babies, and an insomniac with an iron for a head, among others.[...]"
5,a solid gold gem!,"This is a tremendous book. I liked The Girl in the Flammable Skirt very much but this book...it hits a little harder. All of these stories are fantastic. The one about the pumpkin head couple that have a son with an Iron head is amazing. Its so unreal yet the emotion it evokes is an intense combination of every real feeling the reader has ever felt. Its about being an outcast. Its about being loved anyway-or rather, because of our eccentricities. And she writes with such lyrical subtlety...the words read smoothly and quick but looking back (i read this about a year ago) i can recall so much detail and feeling. These stories are more tangible than you will realize. Read it."
3,And every story is a metaphor,"Intellectually, I admire Bender's skill and style. Her work is vivid and visual. But for me, the everpresent metaphor at the heart of each story becomes tiresome because it's always so creepy. Potato babies, a tiny man in a birdcage; I wonder if she can write a story about people and what they do to each other without resorting to the grotesque and surreal. Certainly her fans would disagree with me. They must be seeing something in her work that I don't. I don't have this trouble with the equally creepy and metaphor-laden work of Angela Carter, because there is a certain savage beauty in Carter's work that I feel Bender's work lacks. Maybe it's mordant vs. morbid, or maybe Bender's work has a lack of heart. I enjoyed this collection much more than the first collection, and I'm perfectly willing to concede that it's me. I'm just not ""getting it."""
2,"Good idea, but a miss.","I am hearing impaired and I cannot ever hear the intercom ringing. The remote flash idea is great and, when it works, it is the perfect solution. Unfortunately, the unit is very sensitive to interference and flashes randomly every 5 minutes. I tried it at a different location - very remote and with no real source of interference within miles - but still got the flashing. In the drawer it goes for good."
5,Sonic Alert TR75VR,Darryl love itwork wellflash all the time ring lightgood pricenice productDarryl Swensenwonderfulnever missed
3,"Scholarly, yes....","But no Eckhart! Based on the title, I was surprised to find that the book is all analysis, with no intact samples of Meister Eckhart's writing at all.I believe that the main quality of Eckhart's writing is, as the author states, his use of the language. We don't get that here, as everything is paraphrased, or chopped into very small quotes by the author.It is like facing a wall, and listening to someone tell us about a sunset, or, more exactly, perhaps, listening to someone describe Rumi's poetry without giving us any.The power, the ooomph, the emotional and spiritual impact of Eckhart has been pulverized into an endless series of philosophical arguments.This seems to me to miss the point in a major way.To experience Eckhart, read Eckhart. ""Wandering Joy"" delivers admirably.If you've already experienced Eckhart, and you want a more in-depth ""scholarly"" analysis, read this book by Bernard McGinn."
3,Not very impressed,"I was pretty hesitant to buy this DVD in the first place, but when I watched it, I was quite disappointed. It does have a lot of info, but the consistently brown coloring throughout the interviews got on my nerves. I expected more pictures of the early Beatles, but the photos shown in this documentary were used again and again. I must admit, the packaging is very attractive, but that's about it. I did like Astrid's chapter on the DVD in which she talks about the Beatles personally(She should have her own DVD), but other than that, I wasn't blown away by this DVD. View at your own risk."
1,a total ripoff.,"If you expect a rare footage of the Beatles with Tony Sheridan, forget it, you would not get it. Instaed, you will get a lot of interviews, not all of them relative to the topic, a lot of brownish- yellowish stills of Liverpool and vicinity, and of Hamburg, off course.The fancy package, including real postcards, did not convience me a bit.With all due respect to Tony Sheridan and everyone else who appears on this production, I believe that the costumer who buys this product would expect some otencity, especially when it comes to the music: a lot of the tracks are digitally re-mastered or recently recorded.There is so much superior Beatles materials out there,I simply cannot understand what is the real porpuse of this production, other than making some dough on behalf of the group.Me, a keen Beatles Fan."
1,There's no Beatle footage.,"Yeah, I know ""this dvd is essential for students of the Beatles"" yadda yadda, but a classy looking on the outside, no actual Beatles footage on the inside, Beatles DVD = WTF! aNgRyzoRz111 ;[ We already have the music. It should have just been a book, or better yet, never have been conceived or manufactured in the first place. I'd let Ben Affleck give me a shoulder massage before I'd reccommend this to any human being who hasn't first received a lobotomy to spare them the pain and torture of watching a bunch of fab-gabbers giving interviews, immersed in some sort of bad honey-poop background tint."
4,Good for a modern romance,"I liked this book. I generally only read historical romance, but I love Brenda's Deadly series so thought I would give one of her modern romances a try. I liked this one. I did suspect the ending because there was a similar situation in one of her other books, but still I thought it was good."
1,No star for no credibility,"How naive, clueless (though hundreds are provided) and borderline moronic can someone be, even a slapped-down twin sister?! It's hard to get through a single page of this frustrating book without thinking, ""Duh, Sherlock!"""
2,Long winded and plot is laughable,"""Double Take"" does a poor job of convincing the reader of the credibilityof the plot. Twins switch places much better in Judith Michael's ""Deceptions""and I would recommend that book over ""Double Take."""
1,Wishing for -0- stars . . .,"Twins switching identity is as old as fiction itself. And, so, sadly, is Brenda Joyce's vapid plot in DOUBLE TAKE.I never for one minute bought Kait and Lana's story. As wimpy as Kait was at the beginning of the story, there is no way she could have carried off such an elaborate deception. I agree with other reviewers here who say the clues were legion, so why didn't anyone catch them?Joyce must think her readers have mush for brains . . . and she must have assumed that not one of us has ever read a mystery.I still can't figure out how authors who turn out fluff like this continue to get published, while those with fresh voices and interesting plots have a pile of rejection letters in their files.Blech."
1,Complete rip-off - IT'S A REMAKE!,"This is not the original 7"" version of this song from 1984. It's a cheap remake of it that only barely sounds like the original. Don't waste your money on it. You will not be satisfied."
4,Surpised,"Forget the physics and logistics of the situation and forget that Stephen Baldwin is known for being in cheesy movies. To my surprise this is actually an excellent movie. The acting was not the best, but I was expecting that. The director was obviously very good and turned what normally would have been a bad movie into something worth watching. This is unusual in these types of movies and I want to say congratulations to Terry Cunningham for pulling it off. The real question is would I be willing to add this to my personal movie collection, and the answer is yes.As to the comments by ""rewt""; Acting: B, technical affects: A, physics and logistics: F (rewt was right there, but most people are ignorant about that). It gets 4 points from me (again to my surprise), because I want to watch it again."
1,Watch it on cable...if you have cable,"I saw this on 'SyFy' and I like cheesy sci-fi movies, but this is missing that certain something. The review by 'anim8rfsk' was spot on and hilarious. Normally I like movies with ""Giant Space Rice Krispies"" and 'drop-a-nuke-in-the-center-of-the-moon-to-make-it-heal-itself' type of thing because of the silliness, but this time it's just a little flat. I could watch this again, but I certainly wouldn't pay for it."
3,Magnificently Mediocre.,"This movie doesn't have anything new to offer. It has a little action, drama, and suspense. Not enough of any of those things to make you care very much though. It's like a cheap lazy version of Armageddon. I'm not gonna waste time talking much about it, and I don't think you should waste your money on buying it or watch it. Unless you come across it on the Sci-fi channel don't give it a second thought."
4,Must review relative to the competition,"There are alot of negative reviews of this movie, but in comparison to the standard Syfy fare (mega shark vs giant octopus)!? this looks like it was a Spielberg production.There is an actual plot and the director keeps it moving along.For Syfy this makes it a standout."
5,Earthstorm,"Stephan Baldwin is his usual solid character capable of anything, but without the macho attitude put in so many sci fi movies. Excellent science--at least credible as far as we need to know to enjoy this 'what if' story. The 'must hate character' a know it all scientist (Dirk Benedict) is wonderful to despise! Lots of fun to watch."
3,"Sounds hilarious, I'm going to get it!","I'm a new Dirk Benedict fan. I started watching old tv shows online, including Battlestar Galactica, and now the A-Team. Now I'm looking for Dirk Benedict movies. I laughed out loud all the way through anim8rfsk's review, it's hilarious! I'm going to get this movie because of your review! I sort of wished he got a girl too. I'm pre-rating this based on your review. Please suggest more Dirk Benedict movies for me! I like him best so far as Starbuck."
3,Did I miss something?,"I bought this movie ( I like these types of movies ) except during the movie sayings kept popping up saying not for sale or resale? . I must have missed that class, what gives?"
4,Okay,"Its a good movie. Mainly for the people who like all of the astronomy kind of stuff. Like myself.It has pretty fake stuff, like when the debris goes through earths atmosphere.I would suggest this movie for people who like this kind of stuff. Like me.(..)^^----"
2,What Roger Smith's ex thinks about Solinger,"My son, Fayde, and I think that the music is updated Kirk. One exception, Crux 88. Have seen the band since that year in muenster, tx. Nothing new. Fayde says to Johnny, ""hey, little dude"". Get a new gig guys! @"
3,fantasy world with magic virtually lost,"I chose this rating because it was only an okay read... Having read her other books and series, this was not as good... the story was interesting and had a lot of possibilities... the women folk go after a famous mercenary warrior to teach them how to fight so they can release their men folk and fight off the super wizard who is taking over the world..... there is a lot of violence and death.... the fight to release the men is totally ignored while the famous mercenary realizes that he is a wizard... albeit untrained... it was ok... worth a read if you like this genre..."
3,Beware of video input/output limitations,"I thought this was the answer to my AV woes... but it was not.If you need to use the component video AND the analog (yellow) video inputs/outputs, this unit will not work.I am now in search of a A/V Receiver that will. I need to connect a DVD player/recorder and this unit will not allow it. I need the component video for my HDTV...Quite a pickle I got myself into... hope there is an answer!Otherwise, this is a great unit. I got to know it very well... too well I think. However, they SHOULD make it clear that this limitation exists for non-AV geeks like me. I think I know now why this limitation is there but the write up is misleading. They really should note that only one video type can be used.Sony's support was also excellent."
4,good unit for the price,"First off I have not had a new receiver for over 20 years, and I'm not extremely knowledgeable when it comes to receivers (note the 20 year part). That said, I'm very pleased with this unit. It was easy to set up. The only question I had was how to run the VCR into the unit using the RCA and from the unit to the TV using Component video. It was easy to get in contact with tech support and find that the best way is to run Component from the DVD player to the TV, bypassing the unit. For features, The unit's menu was easy to use and I like the ability to adjust the sound for each speaker separately after the initial configuration. I have a VCR, game system, CD player and a DVD player hooked up to it."
4,hamish stuart at his best!,"""sooner or later"" hamish stuart latest CD is a brilliant work of art. his harmonizing and vocals really brings out the best in his songs. if anyone was ever a AWB (average white band) fan, they should absolutely check this CD out. i rate it four stars. gralin nelson"
1,Hate It!,Nothing at all like the games!! I Hate it! Don't Buy this garbage if you don't want to corrupt fans-to-be.
5,"Finally, SatAM fans rejoice","Sonic meets DVD technology! As he would say, ""Way past cool!"" I have not seen SatAM in so long. I have some RealPlayer and MPEG files that satisfied me for awhile, but no longer. When I popped this DVD in my player and saw the picture, I was HAPPY! Though the first season Sonic shows are not as good as the second season ones, the DVD was worth it for any fan (or any future fan). I can't wait for the second season shows to come out- which have better graphics and sound.All you SatAM fans out there, buy this DVD. Support Sonic. Show DiC and Sega you want more.Like to say more but as Sonic would say, ""Gotta juice!"""
2,Not so good but ok,this was ok but some of the parts in it were nasty it has lots of kissing and huging if you like sonic with romance this is a tv show for you
1,Don't listen to that review below mine!,"I hated this Series,because it's not sonic's style to be dark and dramatic. for me, it's the game's style all the way. I love all the characters from the games, not the new ones from this show. Don't buy this, even if you're new to sonic."
4,"Finally, no more old tapes for me!","Now I can don't have to watch those horrible quality tapes of episodes I have halfway recorded. 5 complete high-quality episodes for 14 bucks. Since there are only 26 episodes of the series, it probably would have been a better move for DiC to release the series in 2 sets. But hey, I'm not complaining. If you're a fan of the series, this is for you. Here's looking forward to more promised DVDs."
5,One of the 5 Best Cartoons Ever!,"There are certain American cartoons that proudly stand apart from all others for having brilliant writing, beautiful animation, fantastic story arcs, and loyal cult followings. They include Exo Squad, Gargoyles, War Planets, X-Men... and SONIC the Hedgehog. This DVD, my friend, is nearly TWO HOURS of one of the best cartoons ever made. Do not confuse this with ""The Adventures of StH"" or ""Sonic has a happy christmas"" or any of those other... Sonic cartoons, this is the REAL THING. Even if you're not a Sonic fan, or you're not into cartoons at all, you MUST buy his DVD. Until then, you don't know what you're missing!"
3,"Good stories, needs an editor","I found this book somewhere a year or so ago, and just re-read it as background for a book I'm writing on the history of a nearby village. I grew up in the area, and can attest to the authenticity of Dr. Eppolito's tales. They accurately reflect the regional culture. However, as a previous review indicated, the good doctor is in serious need of an editor to make things more readable. Particularly noteworthy are several cases of unnecessary recapitulation of the circumstances of the stories. It seems as if he perhaps re-wrote a section of a story, moved it to the beginning of the story, and then forgot to remove the original statements.He's got a flair for language and his descriptive powers show promise. All that's needed is for someone to help with structure and organization. The stories themselves are interesting and the characters are engaging."
4,"Slow, but has it's good points","Many people would find this movie horrible, but what you have to realize is what it is before watching it. This movie is very strange and original, and it is an independant film. It is slow and the acting is not top par, but it was nonetheless interesting to me. It has a very ""creepy"" effect to it that just kind of makes you feel weird, which most horror movies do not. To watch this movie you must have patience and an open mind. If you want a more stereotypical good horror film you should not be watching this."
5,Wonderful Pillowcases,"Due to the high thread count and the sateen weave of these pillowcases they are strong, soft and beautiful. The pillowcases are also nicely made with lots of extra fabric to cover the pillow and with a nice hem at the end of the case. These will last a VERY LONG time."
1,I loved it!,"...Not. NOTHING ever happens, that's why these are episodes that you never saw...they suck. They still censor everything, but there is no plot, no storyline, no interest. NONE.Save your money..."
4,A Fun Group of People,"I didn't like this one as much as the Back to New York DVD but it was pretty good. They show lots of Ace, Adam and Christina so if you like them then you'd probably enjoy this DVD. There are a surprising amount of extras and I definitely think this is worth the money if you enjoyed the Paris season."
3,Too Short!,"I enjoy watching the Real World on MTV, so I was looking forward to viewing this DVD.I was disappointed because the DVD is too short. MTV records the cast 24/7 so you'd think there would be more footage to share on this DVD. Not so.However, what little there is is entertaining."
5,one of my favorites,I got this almost 2 years ago and I still keep it in my 6 disc player all the time..it has been one of my favorites...very cool..lots of style and emotion..not the usual garbage the major companies seem to crank out..it has the stood the test of time.I highly recomend this cd to all..alot of emotion and styles.
1,Not the cable shown on the picture,"On the picture it is showing 8pins, but I got something different. i don't know why. So It is not the one I was looking for."
3,Didn't work,"It may be the adapter, or it may be the stereo. In any case, it simply doesn't work. The head using doesn't recognize that the adapter is plugged in.I'd give it a single star, but it's possible that it's the fault of the stereo rather than the adapter."
3,Burn and Build,"The workout is good, a bit too long though. It seems like if you would use a little heavier KB and fewer reps that you could get the same or better results in half the time. Either way you end up having a good workout."
3,Review of product,It would have been better if the set had the correct CD's included. My kit had 2 of the same CD's (Font II's).There was no Font I included.
1,Disappointing,"I bought the 4 DVD collection thinking there would be more to learn from viewing all 4. Not so. There seemed to be little difference in the methodologies applied, and those seemed very limited. I doubt that any of these DVDs will ever be put on my player again. A far better source of information (and far better dollar value) is the book (available from Amazon) ""She Comes First (the thinking man's guide to pleasuring a woman)"" by Ian Kerner, Ph.D. The anatomical information is more detailed, explains far more about just what is going on down there, and how to get the desired results. These DVDs added nothing."
5,Mind-bending thoroughfare!,"Zollner was a German astrophysicist who studied optical illusions. He invented the Zollner illusion where lines that are parallel appear diagonal. In this book, he takes a hard investigative look at all types of phenomena that boggle the mind and helps the reader to understand it from a scientific and mathematical perspective. A very enlightening read!"
1,i have not received package,"everything is lie, don't buy it...product had stucked somewhere in breinigsville PA. it must be already in Brooklyn at 2 January"
5,BEST MASCARA I'VE EVER USED!!!,"I have been using this mascara for almost a decade. Lately, I haven't been able to find this product in my local stores, a fact that is very disappointing! This is the best mascara I have ever used!! I have tried many expensive department and drug store brands such as DIOR, MAC, Cover Girl, etc., and nothing comes close!! I have written to Revlon to find out if they're discontinuing this product but I have no heard back yet. I sure hope they don't because my eyes will never be the same! <3"
2,It broke,I put it on my keychain and a couple months later the chain broke. So the nunchaku fell and I lost it. So I'm sad because I couldn't find it to fix it.
1,Another weak 50.50 release,"Zigidy's ""53 Miles North of the Gate"" is the same boring trash that he and the rest of 50/50 Records have been putting out. I'm sorry but nor Petaluma or Santa Rosa (""the rose town"") have any urban base whatsoever. And to say the words ""Zigidy"" and ""lyrically"" in the same sentence is a tragedy in its own right. If anyone has heard the ""F-Zigidy Mixtape"" by bloxxx that is a piece you can call ""lyrical"". Zigidy got his rep handed back to him on a silver platter. I suggest you all forget about this album and try something new, like maybe making good music."
2,"Great cycle, but the figure's bad!","After seeing this item's promo pictures at toybiz.com, toynewsi.com and actionfigure.com, I was really excited to see a half flame-on, half flame-off Johnny Storm figure (I really wanted a full flame -off Johnny figure, but this is better than nothing). Well, the cycle was just like the promo pics. The figure is another story. Boy, toy biz sure dropped the ball on this figure. The figure is 7 inches tall?!?! He towers all of the F4 movie figures and that's not good at all. I felt a little cheated after getting this item, but, oh well. I'd stay away from this unless you're a hardcore F4 fan or completist."
3,Window to the Lives of Davises,"Disregard the fact that the editor is Hudson Strode. He probably edited the letters to show Davis only at his best as best he could, but they are still original documents. Worthwhile for the insights that sneak through."
1,don't buy,JUST ONE word....JUNK......just bought it for home use...lasted bout 2 months......PICK ANOTHER BRAND....WASTED GOOD MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT......would not advise to buy this item...
1,Plot rests on implausible conclusion to an occurance.,"I did not read the entire book and with good reason. In the aftermath of a chase which ends with the death of a child, for some reason or other the hero, Dante and his protagonists blame him. This has no relation what would really happen in real life. Because the rest of the story depends on that as a foundation and I thought it falacious, I would not finish the book."
1,Plot is based on totally unrealistic conflict .,"Police Lt. Dante is placed in a totally unrealistic position of being held responsible for the death of a young girl, the daughter of wealthy supporter of the Mayor. Death occured when bad guy throws hostage child into street in path of auto which kills her. This happens during chase by Dante of bad guy. No jurisdiction in its' right mind would ever blame the officer for such a death. That is the opening of the plot and is necessary for the balance. But because there is such far fetched set up, anyone with common sense will put this one down. I write this as a former street cop and later my city's Commissioner of Public Safety."
3,"Short version of ""Christmas in Concert""","This cd is a 10 selection recap of the 24 track ""Christmas in Concert"". If you have ""Christmas in Concert"", you don't need this cd at all. If you just want a few songs and can get this cheap, fine, but you might want to see if you can get the complete version."
1,He sings of Cassandra,"Did not want that song but the rest are ok. After reading his autobiography has made me dislike the songs "" For You"", and ""Annies Song"". Also any song about Austrailia."
3,Its okay,Some of the experiments do not work the ones that do are okay but did not hold my 9 year olds son's interest long
2,Unimpressed,"My 9 year old granddaughter liked this ok, but it was extremely unimpressive. She is a gifted and very bright creative thinker who loves to play gags. Most of the items were basic household stuff, ie; to make the fake vomit you pour elmers glue (provided) onto a piece of plastic wrap and scoop (with a very small & hard to use measuring ""spoon"") what appears to be catfood (provided) onto the glue--then leave it to dry. It took almost 3 days to dry! She had fun with it for a few hours, and hasn't really used it since. She did ask for help to research (online) on how to make more gags & practical jokes though. Smart girl!There really isn't much of any scientific educational merit either.Don't buy this."
4,A really wonderful story....,"This is truly a great love story. A really wonderful story with great acting that touches the heart. It kept me thinking about it for days after i saw it. And I know have a new appreciation for the BROTHERS FOUR and their version of ""TRY TO REMEMBER"". This is a must see movie."
4,Fun!,I've always loved Bollywood dancing and the Indian culture so I bought this for my daughter and I to learn. The steps are easy to follow and I love how it all ties in to a story (you learn the history behind the moves!).
2,dance to only one song_ and that too a flop song of a superflop movie,"ok, i bought this dvd after a lot of research. to be very frank, a normal dance/fitness dvd costs around 6-10$. this one is much more costlier. so, no doubt i expected it to teach me some great steps of bollywood dance.and what do i get? a dance clas for the song ""aja nachle"" from the movie of same name. to begin with, i really dont like the song. the song is not like the other bollywood songs, which just force you out of your chair to dance.the teacher is good, and she has simplified the steps. but lets be honest, the dance taught is hardly bollywood dance. it is semi classical indian dance. and another harsh fact, the steps taught wont be useful on a dance floor, coz, frankly, bollywood dance today hardly has any semi-classical numbers.overall, the cd disappoints!"
5,All in one DVD!,"This DVD is all-in-one fun pack. I found it a great source to learn bollywood dancing. The instructions are simple to follow. It also has a complete choreography for one popular bollywood song. The instructor, Pallavi, is very energetic and has lot of grace. I love the bonus fitness routine. Fun to try with family and friends!"
4,Ultimately Satisfying,"If you are even attempting to take on this project, you are likely a fan of Wright's work. It helps to know Wright's style and history. There are some flaws or omissions in the instructions (see ref to part #57 in other review) and one or two errors in the printing. Not for kids or the impatient. As you gain experience the task becomes easier as you are able to anticipate how things will come together. The finished product is very attractive and unique. An inexpensive project for cold, winter nights."
1,"Cool little trinket, but it has a problem","""Accurate in every detail"" except that it's upside down.The curve should draw a backwards S, as it does here, but the rounded side of the dark half, Yin, should be facing down. The direction of the curve isn't SO important, but philosophically, the fact that Yin is rising here is a direct contradiction of the symbol's lesser known meaning."
1,Buy The Real Deal Instead,"I'm always suspicious of a seemingly ""new"" Bee Gees DVD, and it seems I was right to feel that way. This is a bootleg of the Bee Gees One For All 1989 DVD, with a Spanish menu and (I presume) Spanish disclaimer about violating copyright. What a joke! To be absolutely fair, the audio and video are excellent quality, so if you don't care that it's a bootleg and want a cheap copy of the One For All DVD, buy it. Otherwise, save your money and buy the real deal. This ain't it."
3,"2 great bands, frustrating video","I guess there just IS no decent video of most great 70's bands, certainly not of BOC. I bought this mainly for the BOC part but I agree that Heaven and Hell is a great Sabbath album, so that was a bonus. RJD is awesome.I hate the way the disc switches from one band to the other, and then back, then back again. WTF. The sound is ""ok"" but the darkish video is pretty poorly shot. I guess I am just spoiled after watching such great modern video like Roger Water's In The Flesh Live.Bottom line, this is worth picking up if you can get it cheap. Certainly do not pay some of the ridiculous prices some people are charging for it."
3,rb3176,"The frame and the lens are excellent piece of work from rayban. Styling is also appreciably nice and it hugs the side of my head well. The only problem I have is the ear sock, they don't last very long. I have my sunglasses for 2 years now and I have replaced the ear socks twice already. And it is not easy to find a replacement."
1,"Bad quality, avoid this model","I've bought these in 2007 from these sellers (nice guys), as I needed some glasses to keep in my car. I only worn them sporadically, no more than 10 times in total, but one day (a few months later after purchase date) one temple tip just broken while I was with the glases on! I could not belive that thsi is happening. Ok, I repaired them myself and then throw them into the glove box. After a while the temple tip broken again! I crashed them under my boot and thow them away.Now I wear a fien Bolle Avenue. Rayban? No thanks"
3,Pretty good,"These are incredibly light weight, comforatable and easy to forget you have them on. But, they fog up badly once you start working up a sweat."
2,Not all Irish,"I was under the impression, that this was a CD of all Irish songs. As it was not, I was quite disappointed! I listened to it once and then gave it away."
1,Broke way too quickly,My son loved this toy for the approximately 6 days that it worked. Was a big disappointment.
1,This new series should be avoided by Drake fans.,"Drake's second visit to the Belisarius model falls very far short of his first, The General series. I am an avid fan of all Drake's work and in particular have read and re-read The General so many times that the covers of my copies are worn away. This new series is a pallid imitation at best. The principal characters are worshiped from afar rather than made real by the author. The ""sweat and dirt"" reality of battle scenes from other Drake books is completely absent. We readers need to be careful that Drake does not become the Stephen King of military sci-fi: he publishes his grocery list and we rush to buy it!In short. there's too much scholasticism and not enough reality in this series. I forced myself to read the first two volumes twice just to be sure: Don't waste your time on this series. Hopefully Drake's next effort will return to the level of his previous works."
5,A Tour de force in the genre,"Amazing series. Perhaps the best example of taking historical fact and weaving it into an alternative history setting. Nice to see fantasy that does not rely on magic. And maybe a tad more believable as a result? Whatever, the characters grab you and drag you along with them...across the teeming subcontinent in this case."
4,"Mixture of war, strategy and philosophy","A very different series from most sci-fi books. I enjoy the blend of early Christian factions and the different Indian sub-continent views of religion as a background to the conflict between Aide and Link.Very different from the books written just by Drake and if you're looking for Hammer's Slammers type action you will be disappointed. But someone looking for a mixture of that type on the edge strategy coupled with deeper meanings it is a fun read, since in the end only the soul matters."
3,Drake is writing the same story over and over again,"It does seem that Drake is running out of ideas, not only is this series reprising `The General' but it is also set, overtly this time, in the Byzantine Empire, and our hero (again) has access to an advanced computer! Drake does not however have Turtledove's depth of knowledge of the period and it shows. It would be invidious to start listing the mistakes ( Centurion or Centenarius not Hekatontarch for a commander of a 100 etc) but using a real setting without that knowledge is asking for trouble, otherwise it is Drake as usual: packed with action and an engaging story."
1,Handle Bar's are cheap...,"This tricycle WAS awesome for the first year that we had it. My son was able to ride all over our dirt driveway with no problems. Then the handle bar goose neck busted. I called the company and they were able to replace it (for about half the cost of a new trike.) I replaced the goose neck with no problems. Well the other day I came home from work and the front wheel assembly had totally rusted off and busted right above the ""mud flap"". Another problem we had with this trike was that the frame was twisted just slightly when we got it so the front wheel never rode completely flat. For the amount of problems we have had, I would not recommend this brand of an ATV Trike."
5,Astounding!,"With this CD, Luis Miguel proves once again he's one of the world's best! A definite must buy!"
5,A MUST BUY CD,This album is one of his best. I really enjoy listening to it over and over. An absolute have for any fan. A MUST BUY CD!
2,BORING! SAME OL' FORMULA.. no artistic progress!,"This album is so disappointing. This sounds just like all the others. It's becoming so tiring to hear the same old sappy melody over again and again. The only refreshing tracks on this album are ""Te Necessito"" and "" Que Tristeza"". If it weren't for these 2 songs I'd give this CD zero stars. The others all suck! He needs to take some musical risks and do more cutting edge songs. I'm not buying another CD before I hear the whole darn thing!"
2,Could be better.,"This is not one of LuisMi's best. Some songs are good.Overall, his music is still way better than Sicky Martin!"
3,More of the same I'm afraid.,"I don't think Luis has moved on from where he was at `20'.Its still the same brass section, same backing vocals, same organ sound. Nothing new. Don't get me wrong, I love Luis and discovered him when I was in Mexico about 10 - 12 years ago. I walked into a record store, heard the beautiful music, waited for his voice and have loved it ever since. Admittedly I have no idea what he's singing about but my money's on love, betrayal and perhaps, barbequed lamb. Well, okay maybe not the last one. Anyway I see no difference here to ""Aries"" or ""Nada Es Igual"". And that's not a bad thing, but its nice to see musician grow. This is a nice album without a doubt. Along with the ballads are some nice poppy songs, his voice is in fine form, but then he's no Julio Iglesias."
2,Pretty typical and not up to expectations,"I was very disappointed with this CD to say the least. With the exception of ""Que Tristeza"" and ""Te Necesito"" this CD is so typical, it gets boring.I have always been a great fan of Luis Miguel, but with this one he lost it.Don't waste your money."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Luis Miguel is the worst artist on the entire world, his last album just show his poor music and vocal on that production, if you want to get a really good album.I highly recomend you Eros Ramazoti and Ricky Martin."
1,Too expensive for nothing more than a dvd & thin plastic mat,"this is not quite what I was expecting - I thought the mat was at least electronic or something to provide feedback, however it's just a plain cheap filmsy plastic mat that really adds nothing to the whole cheerleading experience. Also, the video really moves too fast for my 4 yr old daughter and just up frustrating her. It might work okay for older kids, but it's not very good for the younger ones."
1,Enormously disappointing!!,"If I could give this product zero stars, I would. My 3-year-old LOVES the Bella Dancerella Cinderella DVD, and she loves cheerleading, so we were very excited to receive the Bella cheer video for Christmas. What a horrible disappointment. The mat is useless, the cheering dull, the instruction painfully lacking for preschoolers. A complete waste of money and waste of time. Go with the Bella Dancerella Cinderella sing and dance along DVD-- entertaining, exciting and fun."
4,Everyday pop-emo album,"theyre just like the last emo band, and will be a duplicate of the next...their vocals are whiney and shrill, as expected from this genre, and the guitar is catchy and simplified, again: as expected. they have a knack for good harmony, though, and tend to have semi-descent lyrics. maybe their future work will be more musical..."
5,Great filter for some tastier water,"I have never had an issue with Brita filters and I have been using the brand for many years now. It makes the water purer and taste better. This is important for me since I often use filtered water for tea, coffee, kombucha, and brewing beer. There are times when it is very important to start with good tasting water and these Brita filters help provide that. After the first few uses you hardly ever get any of the carbon particles in your water, so it is built very tight. It filters the water at a moderately slow rate. It can filter a cup of water in about 30 seconds. I usually use these filters for twice the time that Brita recommends, and I have had no problem. But, if your starting tap water is not as clean, these filters may not last as long as they do for me."
5,Makes water taste better,These replacement filters for my Brita water pitcher work just like the original. They make the water tasty and clean.
5,Delivered quickly and works as advertised,What can I say?They are Brita filters.The package arrived quickly and worked as expected.I would order again instead of buying at a brick and mortar.
5,"Affordable, much better price then the Grocery Store",I love filtered water and can really taste the difference!I do not BUY Plastic Water Bottles!And wish everyone would do the same!!
4,carbon fliters,I would really like this if it where reusable. just add the carbon mix instead of throwing the whole thing every time
5,Return customer,I like that Amazon keeps track of which filters I have purchased in the past so that I know which ones to buy again.
4,It's a water filter,"Well, it's a Brita water filter. Not much to say really. Filters the water well. Makes it taste much better than the faucet water in my dorm on campus. I think the water out here is well water so this filter was much needed. Charcoal particles still seem to seep through after being used many times but no biggie. Great filter!"
5,Cleaning clean water,"Living in NYC, our water is treated,cared for and supplied by the Water Department through century old pipes. Though the water is great when it enters, it picks up ""stuff"" from the transport. I don't want to drink this junk! My Brita pitcher cleans it out. Buying a package of six filters at a time insures my supply!"
2,A one-horse race,"I was hoping that Amazon.com would also offer the Pur water filters for pitchers, as well as other Pur products, in addition to Brita. Most stores carry both products, thereby offering a choice, and while I have nothing against Brita, I do prefer Pur. Having only one brand to chose from is tantamount to having a one-horse race!"
1,filter does not work as good,this filters filter my water but not as good as the original I got in my pitcher. Seems like it uses a different material inside to make the job. My water taste still a little bad after filtering... I will try another kind next time and will not buy this one again. I wish theire was a way to know if it was an imitation of the original filters before buy this. Do not waster your money on this ones...
4,Pretty good,"These are pretty good filters. The filtered water tastes good for about 2 months, which is their lifetime, as stated on the package. The only thing, there are some grains of carbon, or whatever that black stuff is, on top of the pitcher. I haven't used any other filters, so I don't know if it's common to all of them."
1,Filters Don't Work,These filters don't appear to be working. My water still tastes funny. I wouldn't mind the charcoal specks if my water tasted filtered but it doesn't.
