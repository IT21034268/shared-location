2,THEY DROPPED THE BALL,"BEING A KANSAS FAN FOR MANY YEARS, I WAS THRILLED TO HEAR THAT THEY WERE DOING A PROJECT LIKE THIS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE ONLY TWO TRACKS (3&10) WHICH COMPLETELY CAPTURE THE HEART AND SOUL OF A PROJECT LIKE THIS. LET THE ORCHESTRA TAKE CENTER STAGE. INSTEAD THE BAND KICKS IN AND GIVES YOU THE SAME OLD THING. I'M SORRY STEVE BUT YOUR VOICE JUST IS'NT WHAT IT USED TO BE. A PROJECT LIKE THIS REALLY SHOULD'NT HAVE MANY VOCALS ON IT ANYWAY. LISTEN TO JETHRO TULLS VERSION WITH THE LONDON SYMPHONY OCHESTRA OR THE SYMPHONIC MUSIC OF YES. THESE ARE DONE MASTERFULLY.I LOVE KANSAS AND THEY WILL ALWAYS BE ONE OF MY FAVORITES BUT THIS WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT. WHY IN THE WORLD IS MAGNUM OPUS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS SET?"
4,Kansas and a symphony orchestra???,"You got it! This is a superb album by one of the best American rock groups. Who would have ever thought of this group with a symphony orchestra? They did it and it is a beautiful piece of work. The only not so good song on the album is their rendition of the Beatles song Eleanor Rigby, yet it is still fairly good. This album is like a battle of the bands with Kansas versus the symphony orchestra. They are both powerful and come together with some beautiful music. The band and orchestra drive each other to their full potential. If you don't have an ear for a symphony orchestra, I'm sure you'll have one after you listen to this album. This is definately a must for all true Kansas fans."
2,Gimmicky and ultimately disappointing,"I have always been a huge fan of Kansas, and always will be, but I can't recommend this album. The band can still rock, without a doubt, but the orchestral gimmick is both ill-conceived and badly executed - the previous comments about poor mixing are spot-on. Steve Walsh is among the best rock singers ever, but I can't keep the phrase ""the ravages of time"" out of my head as I listen to his voice on this album. Robbie, on the other hand, sounds great, and it is indeed a pleasure to hear him with the band again.If you haven't heard much Kansas, *please* do yourself a favor and order all of their albums from the first one through Audio Visions right this minute, and avoid this unfortunate recording."
1,horrible cd,this is one of the worst cd's ever if you really want a good cd go get anything from DJ QUIK.
1,More cruelty against real (natural) mothers,"This book reveals the dark, evil, cruel nature of infant adoption in the United States. First, the adoption industry preys on vulnerable young moms, telling them, ""We know that you LOVE your child. The most LOVING thing you can do for your child is to place him for adoption, so that he can have a better life."" Then, after the naive, loving mother falls for these lies and surrenders her beloved child, the baby-buyer tells her child that her natural mother ""didn't love her."""
1,obscene,"The contents of this book is cruel, totally obscene and fiction. I can not believe that an organization would spread such lies and deception, poor and cruel advice."
3,Great for policy wonks,"As a blurb on the fron cover says, ""the most comprehensive source for adoption statistics"". The book seems to be oriented to policy makers and professionals in the field. It is a compendium of articles and studies on adoption by various authors. It is probably not that helpful to propective adoptive parents. Sections of the book include ""Data on Adoption"", ""Welfare & Foster Care Issues"", ""Birthmother Issues"", and so on.If you have the time and the interest, you can find fascinating factoids in the book. For example, one author did a review of adoption as portrayed in the media and found about 90% of media coverage on adoption to be negative, quite contrary to actual experience.Another factoid--a review of ""health education"" materials used in high schools found information on contraceptives and abortion, but no mention of adoption.One more factoid--it appears that when adoption records are allowed to be made public, the number of adoptions drops."
3,Brushy Bill Bonney Roberts,"INVESTIGATING HISTORY: Billy the Kid (2003?) - Bill Kurtis (host)Uses the typical reenactors mixed with vintage photos and other articles to tell the historical story, but the aim of this 50 minute documentary is to solve a long-standing mystery.Forensics experts seek to exhume the remains of William Bonney and his mother to determine whether Pat Garrett really killed the Kid or let him escape. In the late 1940s, an elderly Texan named Brushy Bill Roberts claimed he was Billy. Although New Mexican officials refused to have the Kid's grave dug up, why couldn't Brushy Bill and Billy's mom be DNA matched or eliminated?Too many unanswered questions here."
3,"Dark, not for everyone","Interesting, not for everyone.If you are tired of goodytwoshoes stuff in the macabre, then this is worth a try. You almost need a safety word before reading it."
1,"Not a happy customer with ""House of Blood""","FIRST LET ME SAY, I LOVE AMAZON, I HAVE ALWAYS GOTTEN EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED, IN THE PROMISED CONDITION AND ON TIME.I purchased Queen of Blood at a used book store, House of Blood is the 1st in the series, so I purchased this book from Amazon. The seller gave me exactly what was promised, I have no worries about ordering from this seller again.The book however is horrible! It is full of foul language from the first page, has explicit sexual content and refers quite often to demonic issues. BE WARNED - do not purchase this book unless this is what you are looking for. I threw both books in the trash after reading only 4 chapter of House of Blood. In my opinion this book is not for anyone under 25 (actually it's not fit for anyone to read)."
2,So-So,"It takes a while for this book to get going and then once it does, it goes all over the place. There are no real moments of terror or dread. This book falls short. The horror isn't horrible enough. The thrills never materialize. The darkness is never dark enough. The characters never come together and seem two dimensional. There is no one you really care about in this book."
2,Very disappointed,"Ive been reading a lot of Richard Laymon and read about this book and thought Id give it a try. I read the back and it sounded like a texas chainsaw massacre type plot. So I was expecting something like that. The first 75 pages or so are good, but it goes off into something totally different. I found a site that I think explains it well: http://www.lsu.edu/necrofile/house16.htm, it contains minor spoilers, but I think it will save you time. I got about 3/5 into it and got so bored with it, but ended up finishing it. After that, I went back to Laymon, who I think is much better."
1,ANOTHER WASTE OF TIME,The plot of this book was . . . who knows! It's all over the place from supposed horror to sci fi to chick lit to creepy sex - and none of it was good. Is there a rating system we can use to mark the books by the authors who hate/fear women? There isn't anything about this book I can recommend to anyone.
3,Tolerable,"The only thing that saved this book was occasional episodes of good writing. Mostly it was just drivel and tired reused plots. Also, the writer could do the courtesy of at least knowing something about a subject before putting it in a book, i.e. a Glock does not have a safety!"
1,terribly written book...,"I saw the hyped-reviews of this book, and thought it might be a fun read since I like scary stuff. Unfortunately, it is very poorly written. The author never describes this ""world"" adequately to his readers. Fantastic facts of this underworld are brought up only when needed for the plotline. For example, when one character needs to speak to one of the ""gods,"" she steps into a portal, which gives her access to this god. Before then, we never heard anything about ""portals"" inside the house, and I don't think they were mentioned again. Poor, poor, writing. The publishing house employees must be the ones writing the rave reviews. Skip this one, or suffer!"
1,You have been warned,"This book is so bad that I wanted the three hours of my life it sucked away given back to me. Badly drawn characters, a plot you could drive a truck through, and just the overall shoddy writing left a bad taste in my mouth. I thought that ""Deathbringer""was actually good for a few laughs (and would actually recommend that one), and bought this one based on that experience. Boy, what a mistake! Throw every horror cliche you can think of, mix it with some Anita Blake style bad porn, and have it acted out by the most irritating characters you have ever read about. Now, let an illiterate third grader actually write the thing and you have, ""House of Blood"". Leisure is publishing some great horror these days, and this is definitely not one of them!"
3,"doesn't fray, but comes apart very easily","I really wanted this collar to work, but our cat is very stubborn about not wanting to wear a collar. He can break the clasp within a day. The bright colored suede looks like it would be very sturdy and hold up for a long time, so if your cats always fray their collars, I would recommend this."
1,QUICKLY BROKEN,"CUTE COLOR, NICE SUEDE. KITTY ATE THRU THE CLIP AND IT WAS OFF WITHIN 3 DAYS. CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE!!"
1,"1/2 a star, falling off the edge.","I will try to describe what I felt reading this book: the author had frequent episodes of amnesia, plus a broken back arrow key on their keyboard which did not allow said author to re-read what said author had previously written. It is either that or this book is a way-over-my-head profound metaphor for what happens when PMS is taken to the power of 6."
2,hmmm,"An interesting read if I was bored, however it lacked cohesiveness I thought. More for a random factoid gatherer than for the student of molecular gastronomy."
5,A Wondeful Guide to Soccer Fitness,"This book contains all that is needed to know for proper soccer conditioning. The conditioning process is broken down into succint, easy to follow and perform drills. Any level of conditioning will benefit from study and use of this book. Mr. Luxbacher has made a real contribution to soccer coaching here!"
3,Conditioning for Soccer,"I don't normally write book reviews, but I was very disappointed with this book and felt obligated to balance the other overly enthusiastic 5 star reviews. Some of the material, such as the chapter on ""Strength Training Exercises"", is really not soccer specific. Also, the chapter on ""Speed Training"" is largely comprised of games such as ""Numbers Passing Game"" and ""Three Versus One in Grid"", which Luxbacher had the audacity to simply excerpt from his other book ""Soccer Practice Games""(a far better book with great games I have used successfully with my travel soccer team). The 4 page chapter on Plyometric training was interesting, but overall don't waste your money on this book."
4,Awesome,"I have to say this first i love this anime, and second Kiddy grade box set is a great deal and looks awesome."
3,pretty good,"picked it up on a whim, not bad but it didn't blow my mind either, worth watching but not gonna make my favorites list"
2,Not Wagner,"I agree with K. Feucht's review (also two stars). The singing and orchestra were superb, but the onstage actions and attitudes had little resemblance to Wagner's score. I had expected to experience Wagner's opera. Instead I got Stolzl's re-interpretation. I don't want that.My problem is not with the abridgement, the modernist setting, or even the masks. I object to misrepresenting the characters based on Stolzl's view of what they ought to be.Does the fact that Hitler loved this opera justify changing it into something Wagner wouldn't recognize? Not to me. Give us the opera as Wagner created it, and let us decide its merits."
1,Very disappointing,"I was very excited to buy a DVD of Rienzi, but this was a great disappointment. My husband and I are opera fans, but we both found this staging and presentation oppressive and unpleasant, and quit watching after enduring the first half hour."
5,Hot Rod,"I would recommend this book to anyone interested in hot rods of the 50""s. Great pictures and Andy Southard did a great job of representing cars of that era."
3,Bad Description,"The first thing is supposedly Toytota does not use gaskets, they use a type of clear silicone instead. Be that as it may, this is not an Oil Pan gasket, that a person would think, this is a Transmisission oil pan gasket. Which I feel should be marked plainly on the Header Description, but is not. Its hard enough trying to order parts online, sure it fits my car, but its not the park I wanted. I think the seller needs to add TRANSMISSION PAN GASKET, to their header!"
4,Power of Dancing,I just want to purchase this CD (Power of Dancing - Import) from you.Can you simply tell me how I can do it?
4,Purrrfect,"This Was The Greatest Cat Animated Movie I had ever seen when I was a girl; ""Gay Purr-ee"" Was The Real 1st animated Cat Movie, It came before Disney's ""Aristocats"". As a matter of fact when I watch ""Gay Purr-ee"" I can truly see many of the ideals Disney must have took from ""Gay Purr-ee"" to create the ""Aristocats"" that was made 10 yrs after ""Gay Purr-ee"". There's nothing like the original, if you want to see where it all started- This Is The One.I Love You Mewsette ;-)> As far as the seller that sent me the DVD I only give them (3 stars) due to the fact of the case being broken in the inside when I recieved the DVD, but the actual DVD was playable."
5,I'm in love with this film,"This was my favorite animated movie as a child. I was transfixed when I saw it at the age of six and still am (too many years later). The colors are beautiful, and one would be hard-pressed to find a little girl who doesn't fall in love with Mewsette. As far as I'm concerned, that is the ONLY name for a fluffy white feline. And Jean-Tom is a real boy's cat, too. I found a copy which my three girls, ages 10, 7, and 3 are all equally in love with. And it also gives a very amusing yet informative mini art lesson."
5,Gay Purr-ee...,"I first saw this on the 9 o'clock movie on CBS in the mid-sixties (it was the Friday Night Movie). I was in the first grade at the time. Forty-two years later, it still sticks with me! So, when it came out on DVD, I ordered up my copy! True, the kids today wouldn't even ""waste their time."" Too bad! This movie was fun to watch - is fun to watch. Judy Garland and Robert Goulet are in great form! Red Buttons is great, also!Finally, Paul Frees' is absolutely perfect. After all, ""The Money Cat Can!"" (Me-owwww!!) Get yourself a copy and re-live at least a bit of our childhood when things were much simpler! Five stars for Gay-Puree!!"
5,A great movie by Chuck Jones,"This movie was one of my most favorite movies to watch as a child. Once it came out on DVD I snatched it right up. I promise that you won't be disappointed with this wonderful film. It is a lot different from standard run of the mill animation, which makes the movie trully wonderful. You and your kids will love it."
3,Gay-Puree,"I enjoy watching the movie, but there is a technical problem with the disk.It skips. How do I return it for a new copy?Kenneth Lewis"
2,A Hard Sell,"Although Garland, Goulet, and Gingold offer clever vocals, this particular animated film will find few fans. Visually static and possessed of a remarkably slim story line, it will be hard sell to all but the youngest of children and is really of interest only to hard-core Garland enthusiasts."
5,Fond memories,It was great to see it again after so many years - just as I remembered. And the young ones enjoyed it too!
3,Gay Puree,"An old favorite of mine when I was young-It was just as much fun to see it now as it was then! The characters in this cartoon are great. It was wonderful to hear the voices of Judy Garland [as Mewsette], Robert Goulet [as Jaune Tom] and Red Buttons [as Robespiere]. For those of you who are used to the animation available today it won't be nearly as much fun. But for nostalgia buffs [circa 1962] a definte must see!"
3,Great Childhood Memories,"I loved this movie as a child. I first saw it when I was about 8 years old. A discussion with my wife prompted me to find and purchase it. It was good to see it again 44 years later! But, a lot of water has passed under the bridge as they say. All in all, it was still very enjoyable albeit a little slow, but still very cute. Glad I got the opportunity to revisit it."
5,What a movie! Classic Must Have!,"This is one of the best ""animals"" cartoon movie everrrr.. The best part of course is that it has Judy Garland's voice which makes this classic a treasure!!! Your kids will love it and even if you are like me in your 20's or older you will appreciate this movie, story and even the soundtrack!!! it has amazing songs performed by the greatest entertainer in the world Ms Judy Garland. enough said!"
4,What a great animated film!,"I do not think that this film could hold the attention of the majority of Ed, Edd and Eddy-addicted children out there, but it really is a treat for the rest of us. With its great show-tune musical (how could you not appreciate the power behind Garland's voice?!) numbers and artsy backgrounds/animations, I found Gay Pur-ee to be thoroughly amusing. It's definitely vintage, so if you're pining for action-packed Power-Ranger slop or new-ish Disney wit, this is not a film for you."
1,I did not receive this book,"I had no way of contacking you, but I did not receive this book; I believe that that this book went to the wrong address. My address is not what you have on line."
1,lost in the mail,Wrapper arrived without contents. Post office in area has stamp on wrapper that they received it withou contents.
5,Fogless shower mirror,LOVE this mirror. It really doesn't fog up in the shower! Like how it is adjustable. It is bigger than our last mirror and this makes shaving easier for my husband.
5,I Love It,I Love It. This mirror works as promised. I've had a shower mirror for 10 years and just replaced it with this mirror. I didn't know how much better mirror I could have. Now I do!
4,"Nice mirror, but fogs occasionally.","Overall, this is a nice mirror! The suction cups are fantastic - never seen anything stick like that before.I've noticed it fog quite often though and I have to splash water on it, but I still like it better than the expensive Sharper Image bathroom mirror."
4,Good coupling of inner&outer thigh workout!,"I definately could be more disciplined about using them, but I really feel the ""burn"" when I do!"
4,"Get this for your Mother or Girlfriend, fellas!","This is one of the exercise products that I bought in a recent order, but I didn't buy it for me. When I was buying the other things I remembered that my mother had told me that she would like to try this so, obviously, I bought it for her. She tried it right away and said that she could feel the burn. Even better though, she seemed to like it more and more time after time that she tried it. I'm happy that she's satisfied with this product and I think that any of you will be satisfied with it too. As a matter of fact, she works out with it while either on the computer or while watching t.v. so it shouldn't interfere with any of your t.v./entertainment time."
3,Check with Amazon to see how they package it.,"I bought it on Amazon under a different heading, (through ""Allegro'), for a few bucks less, and they didn't package it properly for shipment, leading to a frightenly damaged so-called box arriving."
2,Toning System,"These are very hard to use. The red one you use on the inside of your thighs hurts after a few reps. Because of it's design, it is twisted at the center which causes the arms to turn in an awkward way, making it hard to keep in the same place on your legs. I have to keep adjusting it and I am usually sore afterwards. The blue one works better as far as twisting goes, but you can't spread it out very far."
4,it's a toning system,"If you expect to lose weight with this equipment, you won't. It does what it says. You'll tone your muscles. They'll be less flabby. Don't expect to get ripped. It will increase your strength. I bought this after having three babies. It has helped to tone up my legs. I use it every day and various times throughout the day. It's good when you only have a few minutes here or there to exercise. I keep it on the back or near my couch so that when I get a breather, I can sit down and work a muscle group."
3,Not Bigelow's best,"I'm definitely in the minority with this opinion, but the vanilla flavor was not only too strong but it tasted artificial. (The ingredients list says ""natural and artificial flavors"" without specifically mentioning vanilla.) This is not for someone who is looking for a tea accented with vanilla. I am using 1 vanilla tea bag and 1 green tea bag which makes a more mellow brew, but I won't buy this again -- the Spiced Chai Decaf is so much better."
1,Bigelow French Vanilla Decaffinated Tea,This product was very good when I began buying it but lately it is terrible. There is no taste at all. That's the reason I no longer purchase this item. Thank you.
5,Tasty!,I love Vanilla tea and can drink it all evening since it is decaf. I can rarely find this in any grocery or specialty stores and it is very reasonably priced.
3,product tasted stale compared to previous purchases,There was not as much flavor as I remembered from my previous purchase of this tea at the local grocery store. Could not get it locally anymore and am wondering if product was discontinued and this was old merchandise.
4,Absorbing Read for a Biography,"I found this book uncommonly absorbing, for being written in a biography style. Mostly you will learn about many events from World War II, and how a true story was played out for the Blumenthal family.I expected the book to be okay, but as it turned out, I really enjoyed it! I truly recommend this book for anyone at all, who is interested in reading a real life Holocaust story."
5,A captivating and painful novel.,This book brought tears to my eyes as I followed the life of young Marion Blumenthal through the years of the Holocaust. She describer her pain and love in a way that I thought was impossible. Her will to survive was exceptional. Even through her treacherous experience she learned that family and love could keep her going. And it did.
5,A Must-Read,"FOUR PERFECT PEBBLES is just one of thousands of such stories that mandate telling and retelling. Simply and beautifully, Perl relates one little girl's mode of survival through one of history's most heinous periods. As the author of another Holocaust book, FAR ABOVE RUBIES by Cynthia Polansky, I read everything I can get my hands on pertaining to the Holocaust. This one is a gem that must not be overlooked."
4,Four perfect pebbles,"This book is an interesting book. However, it is not one of my best holocaust books. Still, I must say that this book is interesting as few have a hobby ' collecting pebbles'. The details on the two camps that they had gone to were told clearly. I recommand this book to readers who have just started learning about the holocaust."
3,Four Perfect Pebbles,"Marion was almost five years old when her family fled Germany for Holland. Despite the visas and tickets they had to immigrate to the United States, they were unable to leave Europe once the Germans invaded Holland. They then made arrangements to be part of a group immigrating to Palestine however, they were sent instead to Bergen-Belsen in the ""family camp."" The family is able to stay together until her father dies of typhus several months after liberation.I found this book a bit lackluster. The story alternates from Marion's point of view and third person. Such intertwining of narration and first-person voice makes the story a bit bland and unemotional. Overall, this book lacks the intensity of other holocaust books."
5,Heartfelt and Powerful,Marion gives a powerful firsthand account of what is was like to live through the Holocaust. Definitely a must read.
4,"I enjoyed reading this book, it's kinda of interresting.",Four Perfict Pebbles is about a Jewish family living in Hitler's time.You will get to know all about how they lived and what they had to go through. If like learning about history then will love reading this book. I liked even though i don't like history. I suggest you read this book! : )
3,Another Amazing Family,"I thoroughly enjoy reading about the Holocaust because it makes me so appreciative of what I have. I don't think I could ever have done what so many people did -- survive the hunger, back-breaking work, loss of family, cruelty and imprisonment. I have the utmost respect for all those who suffered."
3,"Medium read, good strategy on acquisitions","Chambers is no doubt a superb leader, excellent speaker, widely respected business man and a hero for all of Cisco. The acquisition strategy is indeed very true, and this book explains how Cisco has managed to grow to its current size by the multitudes of acquisitions and the unique blending of the incoming cultures into its own. It has built a mosaic well worth being proud of and continues to grow in this manner. I think it's a good book if Cisco and acquisition strategy is of interest to you."
5,I loved the book!!!!,I loved this book. Cynthia D. Grant is my favorite author and I read as much as I can of her. I read Shadow Man. That is still my farvorite.
1,Marxist tripe,"Ignatiev claims that he doesn't hate White people or want to exterminate them. As a gay man myself, I can see an uncanny similarity to his attitude towards White people and a reparative therapist's attitude towards gay people. A reparative therapist will say that he doesn't hate gay people, he just has compassion for them and wants to help them to become heterosexual. In exactly the same way, Ignatiev doesn't hate White people, he has compassion for them and wants to help them leave their ""whiteness."" In effect, what he and his ilk are promoting is a sort of reparative therapy for White people, based on the idea that ""whiteness"" is a disorder that needs to be cured."
5,About Time!,People food prepared is not good for dogs. Onions (raw or cooked) and garlic are toxic to dogs. Eating them is as serious as Chocolate. What is a natural diet for a human is NOT a natural diet for dogs and I am glad someone has finaly come out with a safe book that won't kill my dog.
5,Maybe replaces the venerable Ranger Handbook for the Citizen,"This book does a very good job at outlining various dismounted infantry skills. It does it in a way that escapes the pitfalls of military FMs... i.e. to much stuff that doesn't apply to the civilian, poor print quality etc. It is in an easy to read format that makes the information accessible and understandable. Illustrations are timely and helpful. It addresses individual skills, leadership skills and group skills. Individual skills cover things like camouflage and hand signals, leadership skills cover things like patrol planning and op orders, group skills are various tactics. Some of the complaints of other reviewers need to sit back and think. Yes it doesn't go as in depth as it could in all areas, I have yet to find the book that does. And I would like to see a small, pocket sized field version, but that is a trade off for readability. If you're looking for your first book on patrolling/ light infantry skills, this should be it."
3,Less Interesting than it's counterpart.,"This book is the exact same thing asPaintball and Airsoft Battle Tacticswith less images and longer, more complicated explanations thanPaintball and Airsoft Battle Tactics. If you're looking for maps and words and long explanations of tactics than buy this book. Otherwise go for it's counterpart!"
4,Good Refresher,"This book is well written but suffers slightly from the graphics: black and white. Outside of that, it is an excellent review for those us nostalgic over those scaly old manuals we used in basic. I especially liked the old war stories. Like an old drill sergeant, they brought the meaning of book to life. He answered all my questions and put the fear back into me -- better than PT in the morning.If this review was helpful, please vote."
4,Light infantry tactics,"I'm going to recommend this book, especially to the jr enlisted (Army). It is a lot better read than the warrior task manual. This is A way to help brush up on tasks that you will go through pre-mob and any warrior leader course, but IS not a concrete substitute for the warrior task manual. I would call this book supplemental reading."
1,"Horrible, Misinformed and terribly wrong in seveal areas","I don't know Christopher Larsen, but as a veteran of 3 wars, including Iraq and Afghanistan, I would never want this man leading a fire team in my squad. This book is flawed, amateurish and not written correctly. I mean he knows what a 5 paragraph order is (SMEAC) but there so many things wrong in this book it should be taken off the shelves. I wouldn't be surprised if this was written for those fake wanna be ""militias"" in the deep south. Half the hand signals in the book are wrong, another quarter would never be used in the military. I'm so disappointed by this book I can't even write anymore. I'd return it if I could, but I ripped so many garbage pages out. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
4,Recommend ANYONE that has had an interest or even a passing interest in light infantry tactics should read this,"This book combines solid examples, diagrams, and experience into a comprehensive volume that all squad leaders should at least read. I was in the Navy and think most Petty Officers should read this book.If you're wondering what the actors in some of the latest war movies are doing (Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, etc...) just read this book. If you're about to play in a paint ball scenario have your ENTIRE team read this book.I learned more from reading this book in a matter of days than I've learned searching the web in a matter of years."
3,Elementary.,"I purchased this book in a long endeavor to learn something I do not know. That is in no way to say I know much of anything either, however I am one who never ceases in the case for self improvement. All of my soldiering skill sets come from serving in the NAVY, and as odd as that sounds, your thoughts are the same as mine, ""he surely can't know much"". However the contents of this book are already neatly filed in the Navy Expeditionary Warfare fashion in my memory and so while it was a review of concepts and tactics, it wasn't new for me.I appreciate the author for writing the book however, because it is an effective manual of what it does teach, but for anyone out there with formal training in combat related subjects, well, it's up to you to decide."
2,"nice review, but lacking in some areas","individual skill #4: fighting positions not covered very well. leader skill #3: warning & operations orders needs to include a real example of what each would look like. would like to see movement and combat formations covered alot better. file, wedge, column, echlon right (left), line, vee for fire teams, squad and possibly platoon. I personally would rather have spent my money on another book and not this one."
1,"Superficial, boring, uninformative","This book is filled with large photos of teenage boys playing airsoft, and contains very little useful information.Don't waste your money -- you will get nothing out of it that you couldn't get from a wikipedia article on the subject."
2,Ehh.,"If you're in the mood for a quick piece of fluff, a good bubble-bath book, then this is it for you. But this book is in no way a quality piece of fiction. I feel like it panders to the lowest common denominator, and that's pretty offensive. I'm hoping and praying that the main character is not representative of the average mom-to-be, else our next generation is doomed!"
4,The Mad Bride is Back!!,"For a super fun, funny read, you MUST read the Mad Bride books! Starting with the hilarious Diary of a Mad Bride and continuing on with Diary of a Mad Mom-To-Be, readers will be entertained with laughs-a-plenty and many will be able to relate 100 percent.After two years of marriage, Amy Thomas Stewart is starting to feel the pressure to procreate. After a lengthy (and persuavive) discussion with Amy's husband, Stephen, the plan is finally put into action. Only things don't go exactly as envisioned, and Amy's commentary on the situation is, as usual, hilarious. And armed with her ""Baby Now, Baby How"" book and ever-present To-Do List, Amy's adventure is sure to have readers falling off their seats with laughter.Don't read this one without first reading Diary of a Mad Bride since they go together. Both novels are a lot of fun to read and I hope there is another installment soon -- perhaps Diary of a Mad Mom-of-a-Two-Year-Old?!"
3,Entertaining Enough,"Great literature it's not, but when you're in the mood for a fun, easy read, why not?Amy Thomas is a nut -- but I only mean that in the best way. She's silly, she's a bit self-centered and she has her issues. In short, she is just like everyone you know. So to follow her through her career issues and her first pregnancy is certainly fun enough; it's like spending time with a friend. You feel for her and her obstacles; some real, some self-inflicted.Mostly, though, you simply wish her well -- she's that kind of character. If you've been pregnant yourself, you smile secretly as she discovers the things you already knew, those hidden surprises about being pregnant that no one ever told you. You delight in guessing how the book will end, that Amy will be charmed by her baby and that, in spite of her many flaws -- which really make her endearing -- Amy will become quite a capable mother someday.It's a quick, light read. Not a book club choice, but fun, all the same."
3,Date?,"Very interesting book as I just finished giving birth a few months ago.However, ... there is no November 31. Must be a typo that was not found before publishing??"
4,"A Fun and funny look at pregnancy, not just for mom's or mom's-to-be!","First Laura Wolf gave us a hilarious look into the mind of the to do list crazy Amy Thomas as she planned her wedding and drove her fiance and family crazy. Now in 'DIARY OF A MAD MOM-TO-BE' Amy is back and just as to do list crazy as ever, however, now she is hormonal to boot!Amy is enjoying her life with her now husband of two years Steven just the way it is until one day at a family dinner it hits her...""I want a baby!"" From there, trying to conceive all the way to delivery is a hilarious ride for fans of the series as we watch Amy tackle pregnancy in the work place, keeping up friendships and trying to fit in with the ""Mommy Set"".I think women from all walks of life will enjoy this book from the single girl to the grandmother and everyone in between!"
5,"Igloo Quick and Cool Cooler (150-Quart, White)","We ordered these coolers for use on our boat. They are used for storage and cooling food. Great, inexpensive products."
5,Works as good as advertised or better!,"I kept 1-gallon jugs of ice in it for over a week, and the jugs still had ice in them when I took them out. That's 7+ days in the back of my SUV in New Mexico summer heat!"
4,Cooler,This cooler was all we expected it to be but we found it inconvienient that it didn't have wheels. When fully loaded it is very heavy. It kept food cold all week for us without a problem.
4,Cooler Review,"Large Cooler for camping. It will keep ices for two days at 100 degree temps, but there is a fair amount of melting. We mainly use it for a beverage cooler at the lake. Weakness - cheap hinge/latch to hold the door close, broken by the second weekend. The living hinge is a poor design and inadequate for the designed purpose..5 stars knocked down to 4 because of the latchGoing to call Igloo and ask for free replacements. Just called them, they are sending two free replacements. Great customer service just bad latch design.IGloo1800 364 5566Mon - Fri 8AM - 8PM (Eastern Time)LOCAL: 1-203-922-7500FAX: 1-203-922-7555"
5,Heavy Duty!,"Took this on a week long fishing trip to hold the beer. Put 180 cans, three 1 gallon ice blocks, and 20+ gallons of ice cubes in this and the handles took the weight. I'm 330 lbs and I can sit on the lid with another person and the lid does not seem to stress."
5,My very favorite,"I think I have read every Jayne Ann Krentz book and this one definitely stands out as my favorite. The characters are down-to-earth and believable (as much as I like the dark-man-of-mystery, I never really find him very convincing). The relationship is so carefully built, step by step. Truly a romance story, not just a series of lustful glances and bedroom scenes."
4,An okay JAK novel,"I bought the unabridged audio version of The Golden Chance which was read by PAtrick Girard Lawlor and Franette Liebow. I liked Patrick's voice, but I was not really fond of Franette's voice. I probably would have preferred Joyce Bean or Laurel Merlington. Although I didn't like all the bickering going on between the families and the main characters, I felt that the storyline was okay and I definitely enjoyed the ending."
2,Yikes,"I completely agree with the reviewers who rated this book a two or below. Philadelphia Fox is one of the most ridiculous heroins I have ever come across. Annoying and unlikeable. Nicodemus Lightfoot, on the other hand, was the only redeeming factor in this book. He was a true Jayne Krentz character, a take charge kind of person. Unlike Philadelphia, he was not so indecisive.Oh, I almost forgot to comment on the ""relationship"" between the hero and heroin. I saw very little closeness between Phila and Nick, other than in the bedroom. I can't understand how anyone could mistake that for tenderness.This book is definitely one I would recomend you DON'T read. If you want a good book check out some of Krentz's others. Deep Waters, for example."
1,The worst JAK ever,"I can't believe this thing is coming around again. I'm a huge fan, but this book was the worst thing I ever read, and couldn't finish it. Don't buy just because you like JAK. This is just awful."
5,One of my Favorite JAK books!,"I have been a fan of Ms. Krentz for years and this is one of my all time favorite books. Philadelphia Fox is an original character with great heart. Nic Lightfoot is one of my favorite heroes of all times. He isn't movie star gorgeous, but he is sexy just the same. I loved it so much that I bought the digital version when I started getting rid of my print books. This is a definite reread for me.With her usual spunky dialogue and character study, Ms. Kretnz hits this one out of the park."
1,A disappointing swan song...,"As a RAH fan, I was tremendously disappointed with this outing. Long, droning, self-indulgent, this work is devoid of the insightful social commentary and gripping story-telling that marks most of his books. If you read The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, and have to hear more about the characters, then pick up a copy, but be warned; the dross you have to get through makes the update hardly worth it."
5,Beyond Excellent!!....,How to say what this fine book is. It has taken everything that he had written and tied them all together and gave them such a final closing! Bravo!!
2,Don't bother.,"I gave up. It took 198 pages before anything substantial of a science fiction nature occurred. Till then it's almost all the biography of one woman's sex life. Which would normally excite me, but enough is enough."
1,"Only for Heinlein fans. Even then, a bad book","I'm a huge Heinlein fan. Read 'em all. Many times.This book sucks. Badly. Cringeworthy.You'll be embarrassed to be reading it.You'll be embarrassed for Heinlein.You'll be embarrassed for the characters in it.Owwww. Brain hurts. Must stop thinking about this book.EDIT: It is now nearly one decade later. This book still is horribly horrible.I'm not squicked by perversion or sex fantasies, or even by the ""Heinlein soapbox"".I've re-read almost all of Heinlein's books a few more times in the last ten years, but not this one."
3,Super Reader,"The last Lazarus Long book takes a tour of the previous books, basically.A little more tongue in cheek, this book, so definitely made it more entertaining to me.Would you have sex with your hot time travelling immortal babe of a mother, if you could or didn't know? Good question?That family is a bit complicated and definitely irregular as the subtitle suggests."
1,Not a book to read and I was disappointed,"This book was reviewed on Cruise Critic and I thought it would make good reading while awaiting my next cruise. Unfortunately, I could not get through the first three chapters. Maybe it is because of the explicit details of the authors love life or what she perceived as her love life and not enough about the actually inner workings of a cruise ship. The book I got was actually signed by the author, but I plan on taking it with me and leaving it in the give away section of the cruise ship library. Maybe someone else can get into this book. It was not for me."
5,very solid DVD-quality projector,"It's all about contrast, responsiveness. Not HD, but ED (enhanced def.). Matches DVD quality perfectly. Looks great with Digital over-the-air channels too.Careful with after-market ceiling mounts, as the magnesium base strips out easily."
4,Doing his thing,"The deep voice of Greg Brown just gets deeper with time, but his songwriting hasnt conquered any new territories since his ""Dream Cafe"" and ""Poet Game"" CD's, which are his best and by any standards two of the best cd's ever recorded in the folk field.This cd just adds some more songs about rural America, and they are all well written and well played. If you dont have them yet then buy ""Dream Cafe"" and ""Poet Game"" first, then you'll probably want all the others too. The man is addictive."
4,salt of the earth,"Like most music lovers I have a list of songs I consider to be perfect. 'Summer Evening' is one of them. The first few times I listened to the record I missed it, but it finally got a hold of me one day while I was driving my pickup on Hwy 1 near Kalona. This is a great record."
2,Too good to be true..,"Green Green has a great opening sequence, awesome extra content on each disk, and is available at one of the best prices I've ever seen for an anime collection. Unfortunately, that's all I can say about it that's good.I didn't like any of the character designs, and many of them I found extremely annoying. The storyline is nonexistent; it's just a bunch of horny highschool boys chasing after a bunch of girls for 12 episodes. And while this sounds like it should be the setting for a great comedy, it's not. I didn't laugh once during the entire series.Normally I love anything with fanservice no matter how bad the story is, but even with the abundant girls Green Green just wasn't at all entertaining to me. Moreover, while I was watching I just wanted to turn it off and never watch it again, that's how bad it is.I can only recommend Green Green for the most hardcore of anime collectors, anyone else shouldn't waste their money."
3,It's all about fan service.,"Kanenone Academy had been an all boys high school until a coed integration experiment. Yusuke is the head of the welcoming committee and is surprised by Midori. Midori claims to be his lover from a previous life. The story follows the two as Midori as she tries to rekindle her former romance with Yusuke. There are also a lot of overly perverted boys that are trying to get it with the new female students.This story is fun to watch, but it's one of the most perverted and over the top animes I've ever seen. There are some interesting characters and some emotional moments. Even so it's purely about fan service. The animation and the voice acting are both mediocre at best. On the up side it's a fairly cheap series. I was able to by it for $9.99. I would say it's probably worth that much just for the fun factor alone."
1,Adolescent Drivel,"If you want to watch a subpar plot, lots of breasts jiggling around (""boobies!"" is the key word used throughout) and watching the 3 boys engaging in fantasy with each other then this anime is for you. (yes, it happened while locked in a room together, oh so painful!)I endured pain throughout each episode hoping that it would get better, it didn't :( If they could have just dropped the first 10 episodes and kept the final ones, it would have been a much better series.Seriously, watching three loser boys, looking through knot holes in a fence into the girls bath, and then getting caught, come on? Can't they come up with anything better?If you just want fan service, then yes, by all means, please buy two copies, but there are so many other anime series you'll find entertaining, funny and yes, stimulating without having to endure 325 minutes of this adolescent drivel!"
4,An Informative Book,"Though written for young readers, there are few better accounts of John Singleton Mosby and his Confederate partisans than ""Mosby and his Rangers."" Beller provides a detailed account of Mosby's life, from his birth in Edgemont, Virginia to his death many years later. Not only does she create a prefect picture of Mosby's career, but honors his partisan rangers and shows his effect on them.The book describes many of Mosby's succesful raids, including one where he snuck into a Union camp and kidanpped Brigadier General Edwin Henry Stoughton without any of his rangers being caught.This book was very well written for the audience it was intended for. Informative and descriptive, ""Mosby and his Rangers"" is a perfect biography of one of the most effective military leaders of the Civil War."
5,A Good Southern Book.,"This book is well written for its intended audience. It covers the subject fairly well and has a good number of illustrations. The book contains no anti-southern bias, fairly depicting the events surrounding Mosby's military service and early life."
3,Cutting your family's hair,The book is o.k. if you happen to need to cut hair in a style that is pictured. There are only a few styles in the book and the approach is much the same for all of them. I would strongly recommend looking through the book first at Borders before ordering.
5,Well Done,"This book is great for the person who cuts their family's hair anyway and wants better technique, for the person who is interested in cutting hair, and for someone who wants to learn more about natural hair care products. I thought the photos were great and made the tips easier to follow. The author did a great job of bringing a lot of information together in a readable format. Well done!"
3,Basic,This is a good picture book but very basic. It's enough for me but if you want tons of styles to choose from this one is not for you.
2,Not helpful,"I was looking for a book with some pictures to help my wife give me haircuts. The only methods used were funky, didn't have the standard male haircut in it"
5,Excellent Book! Just what you need!,"This book is wonderful! Colored pictures on every page show every step of how she cuts the styles. Her instructions are concise and clear,and her instructing tone is encouraging. She instructs on all the basic cuts, giving you a great foundation for experimenting on your own. Professional tricks like noting face shape, creating guide lines, and holding hair at various angles to create layers are all clearly explained. Just flipping through I learned what I've been doing wrong. If you are looking to improve your cutting skills and save your family lots of money while not making them mad at you, this is the book for you! An absolute must for the home trimmer!"
5,Great book.,"Basic hair cuts for kids, men and women. Awesome step by step photography which is invaluable for the visual learner like myself. I bought this book to cut my family's, my sister's and her kids hair and it it really delivers. If you want to learn trendy fashion cuts then you should probably consider going to college. This book demonstrates classic cuts and is great for no-college home use. Good Value."
1,not for me,I found this book dated and not very interesting. Haven't picked it up since I bought it months ago.
2,A bit repititious,"If you've never picked up a pair of scissors to try you hand at cutting, hair, this book may provide some very basic (and somewhat useful) guidelines for determining the cutting line and learning a bit about cutting hair at angels and how that affects the look and layering of the cut. Having told you this,however, you hardly need the book. The hair cutting techniques presented are very basic and simply repeated (rather than developed) for long, medium, short, men, women, children, and teen cuts. The same technique (with slight variations)is detailed over and over in each of these categories. Aside from needing some serious editing help, the production of the book is also pretty cheesy and the cuts (except for the short hair for women) are pretty dated (early 90's) and boring (lots of long layers and blunt, straight cuts for thin, fine hair). Ok for a very beginner, otherwise, I couldn't recommend this."
1,Disasterous do-it-yourself book,"Wow, what a big laugh hair stylists must get when they get the people in their salons fixing these do it at home haircuts! Spend the $8 and go to supercuts..."
4,good for collectors,I bought this book because I like to collect new and vinatge Halloween decorations. I used the book while looking around Ebay for items. Comes in handy. Could use some more detail in describing items but still worth the money.
2,Not typical Bass Quality,"I ordered these on a different website, without trying them on or anything. I have had several pairs of Bass brand Mules, so I felt comfortable ordering this shoe in my normal size. I am very disappointed in these shoes. While they do have similar fit to my other shoes, they are not comfortable. You can see in the picture, that the leather continues around the back of the heel. This is unlike the other mules I have gotten from their store. This leather ends up bending and rubbing at the bottom, inner part of my foot. They do look cute, but because of the feel at the back of the shoe, I will only purchase Bass shoes from the store now!"
5,reminds me of sipping a drink in a bistro in Paris...!,"I had listened to the Midnight in Paris soundtrack so many times now, I had gotten sick of the tracks on it. I was looking for something similar and discovered this. It's perfect. This music is perfect for any occasion, especially background music for when entertaining guests. Everyone will comment on the great music.But its perfect for pretty much every occasion. It really reminds me of sipping a drink in a bistro in Paris...So glad they have remastered his tracks for the modern era."
5,Speedy delivery of a wonderful CD,Got the CD in Hong Kong within a matter of few days after my order was confirmed. Great and speedy service of a wonderful purchase.
2,Obstacle2,"I agree with other reviewers about positive points in this book, but what bothers me is the examples given : they all seem to be very special people : trainers, founders of training centers, vice-presidents of companies,....This confirms obstacle 2 as given by the author : ""only a few special people have true purpose in their lives"". I think we have a need for purpose in our lives, even if we are a gardener, a pizza boy, a cleaning lady, a sweatshop youngster sewing T-shirts in Laos, an office clerk doing standard routine work. It is a pity that we find no such examples in this book. From the book we get the impression that the only way to find a purpose is to quit our present job and to become a trainer, writer, etc... but there are also other jobs to fill, I think. Moreover, if everybody goes into training and/or writing, these jobs will loose their financial attractiveness, I suspect."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Richard J. Leider believes everyone needs to find an individual sense of unique purpose. When you have this sense of purpose, you can use it as a central core of direction to guide your life and give it meaning. The book is simply written, easy to understand and targeted to a general audience. However, it also seems quite repetitious, in that the same ideas are explained many different ways. Some of these concepts are quite familiar, echoing some basic ideas about the importance of having a sense of mission, path, and goals, much like Laurie Beth Jones' book, The Path: Creating Your Mission Statement.... Finally, while some readers may respond deeply to Leider's spiritual and religious references, others may find them problematic, given the split in the business community about spirituality in the workplace. We... recommend this book for readers who have not yet considered this mission-focused dimension of life planning and for managers who wish to understand this perspective."
2,Nothing New or Insightful,"The book's premise was so promising -- how to find work that fulfills your higher calling. The book just never fulfills that promise. Just a lot of unmemorable writing about how you will be more fulfilled if your work is meaningful. Well, that's not a shocker. But how about some insight into how to find or how to create meaningful work. For such a deep and spiritual topic, the thinking was very superficial. The author merely rewrites what he has read elsewhere. No new thinking. Readers would be better off reading some of the books he recommends in his bibliography such as Flow and the books by Viktor Frankl. I was also left with the icky feeling that the real point of this book was to sell you on his company's feel good workshops. A real disappointment."
4,Honor you Spirit,"This book is not for those repulsed by references to spirituality or religion. If looked at with an open mind and desire to apply the principles taught in the book, it is a useful read."
5,What a great book!,"This book should be in everyone's library. His questions hit home real good, who are you? what are you doing? Where are you going? These are all eternal questions that have crossed everyone's mind. Richard Leider's book addresses these questions, and prompts you to look deep inside yourself to find the answer."
2,Purpose not very passionate,"I had high expectations in buying The Power of Purpose, but alas, they were not fulfilled. The content was good and met my expectation, but I would have thought that a book on Purpose would have been more fulfilling or passionate. It came off way too accademic rather than personal or uplifting. It needed more zeal, more oomph...in my humble opinion. I hoped to use the book as Christmas presents for clients, but I'm not."
3,Pla is a star - the filmmaker not so much.,"This short documentary tries to be a grand expose of the Bangkok Sex Trade, but the filmmaker doesn't have nearly the expertise or gravitas to pull this off. Where the movie really succeeds is in the personal charisma of its 'leading lady' Pla. She exudes real charisma and absolutely lights up the screen. She deserves a much better movie.However, if you understand what this is, ""An Ultra-Low Budget Indie Documentary"" you'll enjoy it. Worth trying out."
4,Worth watching because of the main characters story,"The filmmaker definitely got lucky when he met Pla, the main character for his documentary. She and her story make this worth seeing.It's a simple film (which is fine) but feels too short. The ending seemed overly rushed, as if all of a sudden in the middle of the movie he skips to the end and didn't have any footage to use for it. The ending is quite sad, and with a story like Pla's so much more could have been done.There's not a lot more to say about it in a review to keep from spoiling the ending. But this movie is worth watching because Pla's story alone is worth knowing. I would however suggest renting it, not buying it."
1,Pure Garbage,"This is the worst documentary I have ever seen for the following reasons:1. The ""film maker"" has very little knowledge about the sex industry or Thailand.2. Jordan's voice is extremely grating, in both tone and the actual words themselves.3. This ""documentary"" contains downright fabrications prime example: Pla mysteriously dies in the end4. This ""film"" itself is actually more exploitative than the sex trade depicted.In short do not watch this! You will learn more about Thailand's sex trade from reading a paragraph in the Lonely Planet guide. Jordan has no business making films."
3,Sad and poorly made.,"I was expecting at least a half way decent look into the night life of Thailand,i.e.Bangkok. I've been there before and have seen lot's of the going's on there day and night, but this film maker, and i use that characterization loosely, really doesn't know how to film anything like this subject matter. The girl, Pla, has more talent then the film maker himself. I'm totally convinced that the amout of money paid to her for filming her was pennies. I'm sorry i purchased it."
1,This is Bull,"Pla seems 100 percent realbut the voiceover in the story seems 100 percent bullThe film Maker.He seems to have filmed it with a handicam I bet the Katoeys and Pla had no idea they were taking part in a money making operation.He even complains when he has to pay a small ""fine"" to the Thai police who could just as easily, put him in the local jail, confiscated his equipment permenantly and eventually deported him for working without the correct permits( i think they should have)but i doubt it actually happened.Pla and the other players probably thought he was just a tourist with a camera who, eventually, would actually, pay."
1,Skip it,"Jordan Clark should be ashamed of himself for this film. Perhaps it's a subject that deserves attention , but he is exploiting for personal gain. I'll bet you a dollar to donuts that the ending is a sham. I'll give one star for some good shots of Bangkok here and there."
1,fake and creepy,I just watched this on netflix. What a waste of time. Jordan Clark is a naive westerner pretending to report on the evils of sex tourism. He probably slept with the poor girl making her think she might have a way out of her bar job. Either way she knows more than she pretends to and the movie feels very set up. Jordan's creepy voiceovers don't help matters. Next time report on something you know and understand.
1,"Clueless, stupid, maudlin, pathetic","A poorly made effort, one of the worst and most pointless so-called documentaries I have seen in my life. The filmmaker is obviously totally clueless in regard to his subject. In addition to that, his maudlin commentary makes the film even more unbearable. Over 45 minutes Clark is wallowing in clichés and stereotypes about Bangkok, Thai people and Bargirls, tormenting the viewers with his pointless, pathetic opinions on a subject he so obiously does not comprehend in any way.I can only agree with a former review: a complete lack of any understanding or comprehension is all this film shows. Total BS from beginning to the end. So stupid and annoying, it makes you angry. Avoid this film at all cost."
4,Good product at a fair price,This rebuilt smog pump has been on my truck for more than 8-months and it operates very well. The unit was delivered on time and as advertised.
1,"Don't bother, not educational or entertaining.","Not much detective work with the show going from a couple of dives re-discovering the L'Orient, how? By simply asking one of the host's friend who was on a 1980's expedition that made the original discovery. They make a point to tell how the L'Orient exploded, but don't add ANY new info on the subject nor any new analysis.overall a very lame espd."
5,Simply amazing...,"I'm going to make this review short and sweet because there is little to be said that hasn't already been said. I think this is Capleton's best album, he uses some awesome riddims, you might recognize them from some Sean Paul songs or Richie Spice's ""Ghetto Girl.""Definitely check this out, you won't be disappointed. There isn't a single song on this album that doesn't make you want to start blasting his music and dancing.If you're just getting into reggae/dancehall, this is a great place to start!!!"
2,Poor zipper; Outer shell is not water-resistant,"I like this sleeping bag because it's roomy, big and bulky, and very warm in heavy frost weather as long as it is very dry.I dislike the zipper that snags repeatedly. My son's 40 Coleman bag has a better zipper and lining material that does not snag. Also, as a cold-weather bag, you're going to get condensation and frost inside your tent. Any moisture that drips onto the outer shell of the bag soaks in, because the shell is not water-resistant. This bag has to be taken outside and dried out every day of the camping trip.Edit> I came back to revise this review because I realize that outdoor camping and tent camping are not everyone's cup of tea. This would be a perfect sleeping bag for staying in an unheated cabin or RV, where there is no chance of the bag getting damp. It's also thick enough that it needs little padding (if any) underneath."
5,Sleeping Bag,Love my sleeping bag -- long enough to snuggle down into. Very well made -- warm but not too much so.
5,Buy the other one,"I just ordered this exact sleeping bag. It's completely warm and fluffy. However, do an Amazon search for ""Wenzel Tundra"" and buy the one that costs $45. It is the same bag as this one. They are both rated to -10 degrees F and they are both oversized."
2,Disappointed in a Nice Bag,"I really wanted to like this bag, but it was not to be.I am 6'5"" tall, and finding a rectangular flannel-lined bag of this kind - that is long enough - is difficult. However, this bag is not in reality long enough for someone my size. On a recent trip to Northern California, I discovered this the hard way! The 90"" measurement is based on the overall length from the end of the bag to the tip of the hood.Because of this design/measurement error, there was no way I could ever stretch out without my neck and shoulders being exposed! Despite the polypro underwear, I was never comfortable despite the fact that the temperature was around 32 degrees, and the bag is rated for -10 degrees. Basically, I burned up at the lower end and froze at the top! It' a nice, warm bag if you're not too tall, and I had no trouble with the quality.A very roundabout way to say: If you're over 6'4"", it's too short!"
3,Big City News Reporting in an Age Gone By,"Lively, fast-paced memoirs of Theodore (Teddy) Prager, who began his career as a $5.00-a-week ""slip boy"" for the now extinct Morning Sun in 1916 and spent the next four decades as an ace crime reporter for the New York Daily News. Prager was there when it happened, so to speak, and his first-hand coverage of many of the sensational cases of the day make for great reading. Of equal interest, however, are the stories which didn't make it to the headlines, the lesser known shootings, killings, scandals and other assorted mayhem which were daily occurrences in the Big Apple and, as such, deemed not necessarily newsworthy by the editorial staff. Basically a light, engaging read, sure to be enjoyed by any crime buff interested in what really went on behind the scenes in the never dull world of big-city newspaper reporting during a colorful, fascinating period in history."
4,packed with info,Ready to learn more about Great Discoveries and Amazing Adventures? This is the book for you. The first chapter is all about Nature's Marvels. This is where we will learn more about fossils and the komodo dragon. Next is Chapter 2 with the focus on Earth's riches such as gold and silk. Then we move to Chapter 3 which has info on Lost Wonders like The Titanic and the Rosetta Stone. Chapter Four teaches us about Hoaxes and Frauds.This is a great resource for learning about lots of topics. This is a great book to share with family members of all ages.This book would be helpful to elementary students when writing reports on all sorts of topics.
2,Worked great - Got fried,"This worked well with all my devices - blackberry, iPod, laptop - on planes, in the wall. Until it stopped working completely (fried?) when I was using it in France.It was light weight and allowed me to travel with only one power device and all my gadgets. Despite what happened, I will probably by another to replace it. I will not use it outside the US again :-("
1,Warning: Poor Support At Kensington,"Kensington does not supply power cords. If you ever lose the $2 cord, the whole thing is toast. Targus sells replacement parts for all of their stuff and most of it is similar or has the same OEM."
1,Didn;t Work On Airplane,"I bought this to use on a trip to Europe. Got in the plane (American Airlines 767) and found out the end of the cord Kensington gives you for airplanes does not match the power outlet on the airplane. Airplane has a socket similar to a car cigarette lighter which does not fit the two prong female socket you get on the cord from Kensington. Have e-mail in to their support as to whether I can get a tip to fit, but don't see one on Amazon or on Kensington's site. Wasted $119 and not able to return it since they use the type of packaging that you have to destroy to open the merchandise."
3,Great idea and features but not durable and broke in a year.,"I've only had this power cord for about a year and it started beeping intermittently. The tip needed for the my Dell Latitute cracked after normal use and travel in my laptop bag. I paid approx $100 for it and now need to buy a new one. Based upon the reviews I've read, I would NOT buy this adaptor unless you don't plan on travelling with it and simply using it at a desk or babying it as it is not durable.Look at the new DELL OEM Latitude E6410 Slim-Line Laptop AC Adapter Chargers or possibly the at the newest logitech models."
2,Issue wtih dell laptops,"While this device is rated at 90 watt my dell doesn't ""see"" it resulting in an error of the system working slower and the battery not charging while it is connected. Please connect a Dell.... etc. As a result, the laptop works slower with the adaptor connected than removed. It look like this is a common complaint of dell in general. This adaptor does work well with my Toshiba laptop (at the lower voltage setting) so it isn't all bad."
4,Works great with T60P,Works great with T60P. The other adapter from Kensington (33197) didn't work with this laptop.
3,A llittle disappointed,I bought these to give as a gift. The earrings are pretty but are a little flimsier than I expected from the picture. The sterling silver is very thin and light so I hope these hold up. The garnets are a nice color. They came loose in a kind of cheesy felt bag inside a box with some thin cottony stuff. There is really no way to make a nice presentation for a gift with what they give you. Also there is nothing saying that they are sterling silver or garnets so for all your recipient knows they could be totally fake.
3,"Average Quality, Good for the Price","The earrings look nice, but the setting is a little deep, so they stick out from your ears. One of the stones is loose and I'm not sure how I can tighten the prong to get it to stay better. I'm afraid I will lose the jewel. Also, the backs don't seem to stay on very tight. Overall, it is a nice looking pair of garnet earrings for the money, but the quality is lacking."
4,"Great color, great size, bit iffy on the mounting","Ordered these for a friend for Christmas. They're a beautiful color and not too large or small, but the pegs seem awfully long."
5,Excellent purchase,The earrings are better than I could have imagined. The stones are are deep red and several people have asked if they are rubies! They are very comfortable to wear. I'm glad I made this purchase.
5,Garnet earrings,These earrings are not too big or too small; they're the perfect size and color for me.
2,Semi-BORING,"This book seemed politically written. The ""right"" word took center-stage over the substance."
3,Like a family letter . . .,"The text offers a sense of a bygone day, but it is often repetitive and certainly non-literary. More than anything else, it reads like a letter from one family member to another. So it is totally anecdotal. There is some interest here, for it's worth reading how a ranch family lived. But the story is very specific to the family and reading it gets a bit tedious after a while."
3,An interesting memoir,I enjoy biographies and autobiographies in general and this was one of the better ones. This is a great story of growing up in the tough old west days on a ranch in the Southwest. Its good for cowboy lore and also as an autobiography of a prominent person. It is good to have a little insight into what shaped the author.
4,No Shade from the Sun,"LAZY B by Sandra Day O'Connor gives the reader a picture through words and photographs of life on a ranch in the arid southwest. But it also presents the development of independence, the value of a job well done not for praise or monetary considerations but because you believe in yourself.The way of life is fading into myth and legends, but an aspect of the value of children to the economic unit of the family needs to be examined and studied to give us greater insight into our educational processes. Productive work is the hallmark of a human being, it shines through the dust for this family and their employees."
1,Dry country disappointment,"As an voracious reader, I looked forward to digging into a book by one of our Supreme Court Justices. I expected great writing, and based on the subject, a greatly descriptive work. After a few pages I was incredibly shocked to find a book that is terribly written and hardly interesting. Although there are some good points in this book, it's a painful read. Simplistic writing is okay, but disjointed paragraphs and sentences in desperate need of serious editing doomed the entire story. What a disappointment."
2,Lack of reflection,"I am convinced that Sandra Day O'Connor did not write this book herself as its observations are devoid of any depth and is written on a grade-school level. While the book offers a much appreciated glimpse into the Arizona of days gone by, it reads as a series of disconnected events without any personal reflection on the part of the author. I expected much more from a former Supreme Court justice."
3,Mundane memories of the Old West,"Thousands of people grew up under similar circumstances; the only difference is that Ms. O'Connor went on to become a Supreme Court Justice. Had she not, the book would have never been printed."
3,It's okay,"No- a supreme court justice wrote this ???? It is a very simple tale of ranch life which is not bad for teen age reading but I can't believe it was not completely ghost written,"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"As an admirer of the author, I was hoping for a better read. The subject matter held promise. I enjoyed learning about ranching, early days of settlement along the NM and AZ border, and the challenges of life in this part of the country. After that, however, the book was flat. It felt as if this was a rough draft or an undeveloped journal of thoughts. Much of the book was skimmed, searching for some human interest. In a case like this there should have been rigorous editing or a ghost writer to take topics which held promise and develop them to offer some literay interest."
1,this book is terrible.,This book is awful. It contains incorrect anthropological information. Don't use it in your classes.
4,"A Good Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Quest Novel","This story, delivered to the publisher in 1972, but not printed until 1975 is, in my humble opinion, one of his better early efforts. Koontz is very efficient with his words, and makes a short novel read like an epic. The imagery is clear and concise and the characters are vivid."
3,nightmare journey,The first dean koontz i read-got a paperback at a garage sale. A good little sci-fi well worth reading.
2,Way too many problems - spend the extra money for a good display,"I think it would be worth you while to go to AVS Forums and check out the many posts about this TV before you buy this set.Here is why I have grown to hate this set:1. While this set has 5 HDMI ports they are all on the same hub. So, you cannot your program to go to a specific HDMI port. If you want to use a Logitech Harmony or similar programmable remote this is a deal killer. I ended up buying an HDMI switcher, which resulted me in spending all of the money I spent.2. When switching between SD and HD programming this set takes 5 full seconds to display the picture. Your wife will hate that.3. The set has bad speakers that are poorly placed (bottom of the TV pointing directly down). So, the sound is bad.4. The spine in the back of the TV (which extends all the way to the bottom of the unit) keeps it from sitting tight against the wall."
3,"Decent Quality 42"" LCD for under $1,000","I bought this TV 1.5 years ago for $900. The design is nice and simple, while the audio and image quality is somewhat mediocre."
1,WARNING,DONT' BUY. I purchased 10/07/07 and hooked up. It was beautiful execpt contrast could be better. It got many channels in different formats. The base was the nicest out of all the tvs I looked at. I looked at them all. The back was the best design a column(spine)you could hook things up from both sides without moving the set around. It had an auto source option detecting what device you wanted to use when turned on. The remote didn't work good-didn't remember favorite or previous channels well. After less than 2 months it went dead no pic no sound. Took 9 days for tech to come and tell me take it back NO PARTS AVAILABLE. Got another the remote was worse and DEAD PIXELS on the screen. Westinghouse said to bad-Best Buy said bring it back. I got something else. Westinghouse will ruin their reputation by putting out pour quality items. But if it was good I liked it the best.
2,Bad TV,"I have had it for 3 years now, and it just went blank and will not turn on..Absolutely awful for gaming, this TV has burn in like no other..... very dissapointed"
1,westing house tx42f430s is garbage !!!,"Purchased this tv less than 3 years ago.TV will not turn on, no picture.no firmware update available so now i have a 42"" paper weight.local repair shop says $600, no diceI can purchase a new board on ebay for over $100 bucks and pray that fixes it.Why is it that my 25 year old sony monster still works fine and this $900, three year old flat panel POS is dead in under 3 years?!After researching online it looks like this is a common problem for this tv, Westing house you SUCK !I am sure they are fully aware of the problem and like every other manufacturerare trying to sewwp this under the rug so they dont have to recall or repair.I will never buy another Westing house product..,. EVER !!!"
4,Can't complain!!!!,"Just brought this t.v. at Bestbuy for a little under a thousand dollars. The picture is great. Since this is my first HDTV, I don't have anything to compare it to. I have a HD DVR from the cable company so the picture is as good as it can be. I hooked up both the cable box and my ps3 via HDMI.Con - The remote sucks. But then again I just used the cable remote so that solves that problem. Next is that the t.v. does read any new input devices well. I can be watching cable and turn on my ps3 and the t.v. automatically turns to the HDMI signal to view my ps3. The only problem is once you turn off the ps3, you have to remotely cycle through the other 3 hdmi inputs to get back to the cable box. But then again I did the same with my standard tube t.v.So far I had the t.v. for three days and haven't had a problem compared to the other reviews for other 42inch models from Westinghouse. I will try to update you monthly."
1,Westinghouse large screen TV,"Within the first week of receiving the product, the left side of the screen created a black shadow. Upon calling customer support, their response was to reset the default settings. Doing so did not fix the problem. If I turn the TV set off for a few minutes and then turn it on again, the picture will display as expected. The screen continues to create a black shadow at unsuspecting intervals. I have not received satisfactory support from customer service. I feel the TV should be replaced with a new one."
4,a wild musical ride,"Sogo Ishii's ELECTRIC DRAGON 80,000 VOLTS is a wild musical ride. Shot in lovely black and white, the film plays like a live action cartoon, complete with explosive on screen animated titles. Starring Tadanobu Asano as 'Dragon Eye' Morrison and Nagase Masatoschi as Thunderbolt Buddha, the film concerns the rivalry between these two fantastic, electrically charged characters."
4,"Straightforward, Simple","Delivers what it claims. It gives you a straightforward, simple approach to basic plane and solid geometry. Good for review, or if you are interested in getting through a standardized test. Not designed for deep understanding."
5,He finally understands grammar,"This grammar curriculum is absolutely the best. As a homeschooler, I'd been using Rod & Staff for all children. It was great for some children but one child just didn't get it. I knew I needed something new. Based on all positive reviews, I purchased Winston Grammar and it has proved to be the best investment in my child's education. What it took years for my other children to understand, Winston Grammar was able to accomplish within months. If dyslexia seems to be an underlying issue, this program is very visual and will help you overcome any confusions about grammar. I wish I would have used this program for my other children. My life would have been a lot easier. Thanks Winston Grammar!!"
3,Cool movie,Very interesting movie. A plot I haven't seen before. I really liked the way they portrayed the virtual chatrooms. The main actor was great as well as the supporting cast. Another interesting British film with an original plot. The package arrived on time and in good condition.
3,Just ok,"Just couple words: nothing special, at all. I have dry skin type ,so I thought it is going to be a good moisturizer. Not really:must reapplied this one almost every 3-4 hours/day and at least 2 times before bed time to keep my skin moist . Not good.Would I buy this one again? No.Would I recommend it to somebody else? No."
3,Mary Kay Timewise Age Fighting Moisturizer Normal/Dry,"I have only tried it a couple of times but notice my friend's face (who uses it) does not look all that great, I notice alot of lines on her, but, she says she likes it."
1,Bad way to sell this product,"One reason that this product probably doesn't work is because it is more than likely expired. These products are not suposed to be sold on the internet just for that reason, you don't know what you are getting. If you buy from a Mary Kay consultant you will get a 100% guarantee, if you don't like something for any reason you can get your money back or a replacement with something else. Besides this takes away from the consultants trying to make a living."
3,Ok Product,"I used to use the Mary Kay moisturizer 2, but when I couldn't find anywhere to get that anymore I purchased this. I was dissapointed with this in comparison. It leaves my face feeling tacky an doesn't seem to absorb all of the way. When I go to wash my face hours later, the remainder washes off. I find that is seems rather thick and makes my skin more oily."
1,NOT for sensitive skin!,"Golly, did this stuff ever burn! Turned my face red and the itching! Not overly sure what is in this one compared to the other MK items I use but this one is a real stinker for those of us with sensitive skin. Must be the anti-aging stuff in it. Anyway, I'll be going back to my regular MK moisturizer. It's awesome but this one, doesn't even moisturize!"
4,"Good Book, but not for beginner trackers","This book, by Roy Hunter, is a great resource by for all those interested in tracking--though it isn't necessarily a great book or primer for the beginner tracker, as it assumes skills the beginner (and her dog) might not have.Other than that, Mr. Hunter's book offers interesting exercises for the advanced tracker and for those trackers seeking to expand their tracking dog's skills.Overall, an interesting, informative book. I would have liked it better if Mr. Hunter had offered more explanations with some of the lessons, but I did like his behavioristic, canine psychology oriented perspective."
3,a great idea but...,"I read this book and found it very interesting in theory, but having because neither of my dogs (basenji's) are big on retrieving very few of the games in the book worked because the games build on the idea of retrieving. I donated the book to the library"
4,cool game,I have the first tamagotchi game for nintendo ds. It's awsome. So i am expecting this game will rock too. I really can't rate it so this is how I think it would be rated if i had the game.
5,"Accurate, yet delightfully written!","Dr. Vanderwood, a recognized authority of the Mexican Revolution, has produced yet another valuable work for this segment of history. His ability to gather primary source information written in Spanish and miraculously transcribe into beautiful English prose not only compliments but also lends respect to the Mexican social consciousness that he knows all too well.This is a ""must read"" for any student of modern Mexican history."
2,non usa format,"Be sure to read the part about where this will play.I may be old, but I am not stupid."
2,disappointed,I was not aware that the VHS Tape had minor damage of a few seconds more that once and I was disappointed. I could take the roughed up box but there was no mention of damage. I do not want a refund or exchange. I'll just chalk it up to an experince considering the price.
1,"Unbelievably Bad, Horrible","This movie is so pathetically bad that it strains belief. The script was corny and poorly written, the subs and ships looked suspiciously like the ones I used to play with in the bathtub, and the sets depicting the inside of the subs were so roomy that both Glenn Ford and Ernest Borgnine were able to wear their hats almost the entire time. And Ford wore a jacket, despite the fact that real submarines were almost unbearably hot, especially while being depthcharged.The sub skippers also kept their periscopes up so long the entire Japanese navy could have spotted them. And the crew was able to launch three torpedoes from the same tube in rapid succession.Frankly, they should have changed the name of Borgnine's character to ""McHale"" and added some jokes and a laugh track. It's hard to believe people would have shelled out good money to see this trash, even in 1958.Movies don't get any worse than this. I give it one yuck!"
4,Never on DVD not PC enough,"I've been looking for this on DVD but i guess it's not politically correct, if you've seen it you know what i mean. Still a great movie, the strongest part of which is the superb acting by Glenn Ford and especially Ernest Borgnine. The dialogue is good but the chemistry is even better. Ford's terse command voice during sub operations is also excellent, i can't think of a better sub capt performance beside it except Das Boot."
1,"Used and incorrect parts in ""NEW"" packaging","I ordered and received product, automobile timing chain, expecting NEW -as advertised. I received a timing chain that was for a Ford, not the Chevy as I requested using the ""see if it fits"" option. Then to add insult to injury the crankshaft sprocket in the set was in a very noticeably USED condition. Who is in charge of packaging or verifying these orders? This will be my last automotive order from Amazon. Also, I do not appreciate having to pay for shipping to return an item that offered free shipping to begin with. Looks like another cyber scam to make a buck at any cost. Buyer beware - Dishonesty and Deception carry a price with them."
4,WE DESERVE TO SEE IT ON DVD !!!,Good or bad should be ours to decide! Unfortunately we cant because we dont have VHS players! I dont know about you but I have DVD and Plasma tv! I need this movie to be put on DVD MGM !!!!
5,gift for my mother,My mother collects Gene Kelly movies and she has every movie and TV special that we could find. My mother watches this film almost every day. Besides Gene dancing and a good love story. The movie shows how people dealt with millions of GI's returning after WWII and having no place to live. This is a must buy for Gene Kelly Fans.
4,Acoustic string jazz-grass and swing,"This acoustic quartet's playing and harmonizing suggests bluegrass, but there's a lot more happening on their fourth album than traditional string music. In particular, there's light drumming throughout, no banjo, and little material from the standard bluegrass repertoire. The band's originals are heavy on instrumental virtuosity and interplay, venturing into similar jam-band territory as Leftover Salmon, but with concise arrangements and gypsy-jazz swing reminiscent of revivalists like Hot Club of Cowtown. In addition to their originals, the band's hand-picked covers include a tight arrangement of Chick Corea's ""Amando's Rhumba"" and a tuba-lined take of Ray Davies' 1972 Kinks' klassic, ""Motorway."" The variety that the band creates with acoustic instruments is interesting, but the seamlessness of their segues from hot jazz to folk-rock to twangy mountain and Celtic sounds is truly impressive. [2006 hyperbolium dot com]"
5,Another great CD,"I knew the latest CD ""From the Pasture to the Future"" would be great! The songs are true to Wayback tradition. Saw most of them performed live; look forward to the next CD. These guys are going to be around for a long time."
4,The Best For Your Buck,"I bought this gun (not from amazon) a year ago. I have to say that it is an extremely good gun. The only bad thing about it is that for some reason,the screws above the trigger came loose. I got some new screws and some thread lock,and now,it works perfectly. Other than that,I recommend this gun to mainly newbs and intermediate players."
4,Gorgeous music,"A beautiful batch of tunes, especially ""The Part Where You Let Go""--a song so beautiful, it can reduce me to tears."
3,Forte - 'Division' (Massacre) 3 1/2 stars,"For all you true metal heads out there, MOST of you should get something out of this CD. Keep in mind that 'Division' is extremely H-E-A-V-Y!! Possibly enough so to loosen the fillings in your teeth. Forte keeps it real. From the scorching opening cut ""Dischord"", ""Thirteen Steps"", ""The Last Machine"", ""Inhuman"" and a cover of Accept's ""Fast As A Shark"", this band means business. Guitarist Jeff Scott knows his craft, quite well. Line-up: Jeff Scott - guitar, Bill Dollins - vocals, Rev - bass & vocals, Brad Worsham - keyboards and Greg Scott - drums. Might somewhat appeal to fans of Judas Priest, Queens Of The Stone Age and possibly Iron Maiden."
2,OK band from OK,"I used to see these guys quite a bit, opening for most of the acts that came through town. James Randel is a horrible singer, but the musicians are great. I used to love watching the bass player at the shows. For better Oklahoma metal, try to find anything Oliver Magnum that James Randel is not singing on. Unfortunately, their only major release had this idiot on vocals, but if you can find anything with Mark Mueller on vocals, you'll appreciate it. Overall, the musicianship was much better as well. I have Forte's first album, and it is good. These guys don't suck, and they do know how to put out some good metal. Not the best metal out there, but for the music, I give them a two."
3,Vollume 5,"The album was not what I expected. Maybe not the fault of the Capitol, but my memories were not stirred."
5,Such a small gun.. Suh a great range!!,"This gun has acceptional range to ""conquer The Hill"" in nerf battles. Altought,it has a long re-load so I suggest that you take cover an KEEP IT!! also, if you're intrested, if you get the gun and loose a few bullets, it's very easy to find some extra bullets. You can find them at any place that sells toys. A MUST GET gun. It's also usefull for stealth attacks. However, if you want close attacks, go with the magstrike.Worth ever PENEY!!"
1,Do Not Buy!,This product does not work I want other people to know before they waste there money as I did. Spiders used this product (model# 421) to assist them in making webs. House centipedes climb over it. Crickets walk right pass it. plus my favorite MICE were not bothered by it. I am very dissapointed in this product. I'm looking for the right web site to leave a message for the manufaturer. Once again do not buy this product it doesn't work.
4,ZHARKOVA + IMAGINATION = KIDS' DELIGHT !,"A list of carols wouldn't be complete without ""WE THREE KINGS."" Children aren't alone in enjoyment of the orange camels, and purple, too! The childlike colors, the torn paper collages with stars and gifts and palm trees are delightful, even ""brilliant"" in today's lexicon.Olga Zharkova's illustrations appear whimsical, yet present the story effectively, which means that children respond with enthusiasm. It would have been great fun to watch the construction of these 'adornments' -- WAS OLGA ZHARKOVA OVERLOOKED BY CALDECOTT JUDGES?"
4,"I like, I like!!","Ok, finally Wright has shown me her talent that she has been hiding form me! I really enjoyed this book. Once again Wright's description of the setting and the background information dealing with hospitals were great. Katherine and Thomas was great together. This one was definitely one of Wright's better works, in my opinion!"
3,Disappointing,"I am a huge Diana Palmer fan, and this is the first book I have read by her as Diana Blayne. I guess because I paid so much for it, I hyped it in my mind, and it failed to live up to my expectations. It is well written, but I am upset at how willingly Jolana goes to bed with another man after being so in love (and making love) with Nick. I know it had to happen fast for her to think the baby was her husband's, but it was still a shock to read that she was able to put Nick out of her heart and mind so easily. Not what I want in a keeper. Thank goodness for the resale market."
3,"Nobody Does It Better, But...","I'm not sure how much input Lovecraft had in these stories as Carrol & Graf give absolutely no information regarding where the revisions are. Two writers (represented by 5 stories) Hazel Heald and Zealia Bishop really do show some talent, but they are at their best when they are not doing Lovecraftian-style writing. I guess I got spoiled by ""The Annotated Lovecraft"", edited by S.T. Joshi. There is no lack of info. in that book, (merely a lack of stories)."
4,Incredibly detailed book,"This is the best book to twin the Anthology Book.You can get your PhD in Beatle Arts, studying this bible.However, I rated it just 4 stars because the cover portrait says ""The Complete Beatles Chronicle"" and the picture below makes you think they were a duet (John & Paul). This is a huge and annoying mistake."
1,Lewisohn = overrated,"This book, and others written by this author, are the biggest waste of time ever. They may be ""factual"", but they contain nothing that one could not find elsewhere with a little digging. I'd recommend getting bamboo shoots under one's nails before reading a work of this author's drivel."
5,If you love the Beatles....,"This book is indispensible! Get it! It accounts for virtually every significant day in the Beatles' career. The studio notes aren't as exhaustive as Lewisohn's ""Abbey Road Chronicles"" but they put just the right amount of information across for every fan. I can't recommend this book more!"
5,Amazing,"Mark Lewisohn set a new standard for primary source research in rock music. This vastly informative book combines, in slightly truncated form, his brilliant day-by-day books ""The Beatles Recording Sessions"" and ""The Beatles Live."" Also included are film and radio appearances. Along the way are many suitable and wonderful photographs. Great for browsing or for obsessive fans to devour start to finish."
1,"Good idea, but record","An album with an interesting idea of composition, that is for sure, but a very staid, boring listen, comparable to standing near a very rhythmic construction site while Nine Inch Nails plays somewhere in the background. For those of you who don't know: This album was created out of rearranged field recordings from around the artists home. Instead of making something interesting, however, Decomposure makes bad radio rock. Avoid, points only given for interesting idea."
3,"Not Bad, but Dated","Tamsins work is great, but you may need somethine more up to date if your planning trips...but the the bool is still full of great trips. I was looking for a book about much longer tours (expedictions). This book wasn't it."
2,Bad apple?,"This battery lasted less than a year in our phone. We gave it normal use, that is we do not leave if off the charger for long periods of time. One to two hours at most.We bought other batteries of this type and they lasted quite long and performed well. Perhaps we got a ""bad apple.""We bought a replacement from Radio Shack. So far so good. One caveat, it cost a lot more than the on line pruchase. We'll see how long the ""Shack"" one lasts and if it warrents the extra money."
2,Boring after a short time,"I had hopes of this being an interesting game which could be played over and over, but, after one or two games I find it monotonous and boring. It's on the shelf where it will probably stay."
2,DVD Game,My family enjoyed the Pirates movies so much that we couldnt wait to get this game. Once we started playing it we were very disappointed. It has no excitement in it. We thought it would have clips of the movies but but it doesnt. It is just moving ships around a map and collecting cards as your treasure. It takes a long time to do each turn since you have to put in your coordinates that your ship is on to see if you found any treasure. We played it for 2 hours and still were no where near ending the game. Be prepared for a long game if you buy this product.
3,I got a few things out of this,"Overall this is a good book for a beginner but anyone that has done reporting before, in Crystal or other wise, will probably not get much out of this."
2,Confusing!,"The reason for being so confusing is this book was written by so many authors, thereby the ideas presented are not coherent. This is not a learner's book, and if you're looking for one I suggest you buy Brian Larson's instead - great book, easy to follow and the author will patiently answer your inquiries regarding some minor problems.I bought this book yesterday hoping I could supplement the things I've already learned previously regarding RS, but no, I'll return this book today and ask for a refund."
3,Better for inexperienced beginners,For me most of the good stuff was toward the end. If you're new and inexperienced this might be a good buy. Otherwise I'm not so sure.
1,"Needs stronger editing, walkthroughs hard to follow.","Almost impossible to do the walkthroughs as the writers can't decide if they are giving you instructions or just offering some general concepts. Chapters 1-3 are a waste of time. Go straight to chapter 4 to get started.The format is too conversational and often fluffed-out with irrelevant details.Overall, another disappointing Wrox text that has too many authors and no editor."
3,Good book for developers - not for admins,"This book does a good job of covering how to create, format, and deploy a report. But, like most books, it doesn't do a good job of talking about what to do if something doesn't work. In particular, it glosses over the security aspects of running Reporting Services. RS uses Active Directory, if you have AD installed. but the book doesn't mention AD and how the two products work together. I found that I had to use a SQL Server userid and password instead of NT security in order to get a deployed report to work. The issue has to do with the 'double hop' problem. You can get more info in the Q319723 article on Microsoft's Knowledge Base."
2,A Beginners Book,"The first few chapters I have read of this book have been so disappointing that I'm back at Amazon looking to buy another, different book. I have some previous experience with Reporting Services so I bought a `Pro' book and jumped straight into Chapter 12 and 13 looking for the real meaty information I needed. Unfortunately this book is for beginners. The book is poorly edited - with examples containing numerous incorrect URL's and parameter names, there are pieces of information given that are just plain wrong, and most of the code examples are trivial, wasting a real pro's time - like how to populate a combobox with items or access a querystring parameter."
3,Somewhat Useful,"For me, this book is ""somewhat useful"" because there are not a lot of publications out there on this subject. But because I needed to ""hit the ground running"" and start producing reports with certain functionality right away, I've found it difficult to locate the precise information I need to accomplish a particular task. On the other hand, it appears to describe the application ad naseum, so for someone with lots of time to immerse themselves, it might be the right book."
3,About Average,"This book is about average. With that I am not implying that it is a bad book but rather that you could find the same information on the Internet just by googling a little bit. I guess I was expecting to find something really clever in it, something that it would make it more useful that simple internet articles. Again, not a bad book but also not one that will make the difference."
4,"fun,but not much sound","my 1 year old has alot of fun with this truck, only downside is that it doesn't have much volume, very hard to hear the siren and engine sound."
5,this thing is cool,"its a firetruck. it rolls, makes noise, and is bright. my 6 month old loves it. he can push it into things and it makes an engine sound. its made out of a vinyl type material so its flexible and durable. easy to wipe off."
2,"Interesting idea, but not entertaining","I love, love love The Nihilesthete. But this book was a bit tiresome. I see that the main character is self-centered and has a personality dictated by the proverbial winds. But there is no setting whatsoever, and really no character within. You're locked inside the head of an unformed personality that is formed, unformed and reformed over and over again. But the reader gets but the slightest of information, and as a result you feel as if you're only getting a live feed straight from the brain of a person with a personality disorder--without context, a sense of setting or the balance of other characters/voices. The idea is an interesting one, just not developed IMHO."
2,Smaller than expected,"Not sure why the questions above ask about the ""toy"" when it isn't a toy...so the questions really don't pertain.This is a lot smaller than I was expecting, but it did make a cute centerpiece for my 2 year olds birthday. It fell over easy though and fell apart easily too. But as long as you don't touch it then it is fine."
1,Nothing special,"I'm afraid I'm not impressed. To say any of this functions as good fiction is a real stretch of kindness. OK, so there's a plotline here and there. But most of these stories are smut that's aspiring to be literary. Good try. But not successful. There are other books out there that can manage the blend of the erotic and the literary. This definitely ain't one of them."
5,Closest thing to a perfect shower gel on the market,"I have used this product to the exclusion of all other shower gels for years, ever since discovering it at The Mark Hotel in Manhattan. It is an ideal combination shampoo and skin cleanser, and the only product one needs to carry when traveling. The fragrance is subtle, but invigorating, refreshing and masculine."
5,Great,I've had the Ripper for about 5 years and could still continue using it but I bought a new one just because I felt like it was time. Great and simple pad.
1,very poor quality,"This bag is made of very poor quality, lightweight fabric that ripped on the first use of the bag. In addition to an actual tear, there are several areas (corners) where the fabric has already begun to fray. I love Rick Steves's books and, despite the price, assumed he would not put his name on shoddy products. Will not buy from his product lines again."
4,Author of this book,"My writing partner Deborah King McMartin and I wrote this book together and originally self-published it with Author HOuse using the pen name Lawrence King. It will be available in a Kindle edition soon. I think the book is compelling and throught provoking. I can tell you we wrote it because we believed Toni Jo Henry never received justice. In a way we wrote it to vindicate her.The book is the basis for a major motion picture titled THE PARDON which will be released this year. I saw the premier of the movie at the Stonybrook Film Festival on Long Island, New York, last summer on July 23, 2010."
1,NOTHING NEW!,"ALL REPEAT EPISODES - DON'T WASTE YOUR $My 2 y/o dtr loved Dora, but is starting to lose interest. This DVD is absolutely NOTHING NEW, not 1 episode! I was so mad because I enjoy Nick and Nick Jr. and if I had bought the movie intead of renting it for only $1 from Redbox, I would have been livid to have wasted to money. We have probably almost every Dora, and watched them all so I'm very familiar with the episodes. Let me quote the episodes and their origins for you so you can verify my truth and save your money:(1) Mixed-Up Seasons: on DVD ""Summer Explorer"" 2007Dora The Explorer - Summer Explorer(2) To The South Pole: on DVD ""Meet Diego!"" 2003Dora the Explorer - Meet Diego(3) Save Diego: on DVD ""Animal Adventures"" 2006Dora the Explorer - Animal Adventures(4) Beaches: on DVD ""Summer Explorer"" 2007 alsoDora The Explorer - Summer Explorer"
1,A DISC OF REPEATS!,"I have to agree with the other reviewer who noted there was nothing new on this DVD. While I don't even single one, I was hoping to get some new episodes as the others are beginning to wear on me. I wish I had looked more closely at the DVD prior to buying it and I would have noticed we already own all the episodes. I would have to think there are enough episodes out there they wouldn't have to repackage but I think Nick was trying to jump on the ""Green"" band wagon. If you are just starting to purchase DVDs of Dora, make sure you keep track which one you own."
5,Great book,"What a great book for those wanting the special instructions needed for working with reclaimed fur coats. This book deals mainly with real fur and how it is treated differently than mohair. However mohair directions are also included. If you buy this book and Nancy's other book ""101 Bears to Make"" you will have all the information you need on bear making.----------------------Pam"
4,Teddy Bears with a Past,I want to try my hand at making a bear from real fur - this book gives me exactly the right amount of tips and information I'll need!!!
4,From Mink Stole to Huggy Bears,"I recently rediscovered that I own two-champagne colored mink stoles from my two deceased mom's. The details in the book will allow me to convert them into teddy bears and that is exactly what I had hoped it would do. Fur stoles, a sign of status in the 60's and earlier will be up-cycled into something that will not have PETA raining paint on them."
3,"OK, Could Be Better","It's a shame US Games didn't include all of the correspondences that are on the original illustrations in Papus' book, Le Tarot Divinatoire. Some of the images have actually been altered. The Hebrew letters on ""The Moon"" card, for example, aren't on the originals. I like this deck to an extent, but Amazon has Le Tarot Divinatoire for $23 new, and it looks like there is an English version set to be released in December. For my money, the book is a lot better deal. You can always pick the deck up later if you can find one at a reasonable price."
3,I found this book somewhat Hard to understand,"I found this book somewhat hard to understand, and I think it would be more useful if I was workig in a large group rather then just my own children. It does have some good ideas however, and good patterns for games and flanel board stories."
3,Similar to The Author's Other Book But Still Pretty Good,"THE COMPLETE DAILY CURRICULUM TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION reads similar to this book and contains lots of the same exercises or thematic structure, but the activities nevertheless will engage children. Many of them will stretch your children's abilities and your teaching limits to new heights. Give it a try"
4,The Complete Resource Book: An Early childhood Curriculum With Over 2000 Activities and Ideas.,This book is an excellent book to have as a resource.
4,Childrens craft book,Bought this for my daughter at her request for my grand daughters. She is happy with the book.
3,preschool teacher's review,"I was disappointed with this book, if I had flipped through it before buying I don't think I would have bought it. I was expecting step by step instructions for activities but rather it seems very general. I think a lot of the ideas seem obvious. The GOOD thing is that it is grouped and organized for you. I admit that I need to spend some more time with the book and give it another chance, maybe I'll change my mind. But the two books that I can't live without, in my preschool class (3 year olds), are R IS FOR RAINBOW (Anselmo Rollins and Schuckman) and YEAR ROUND ACTIVITIES FOR THREE YEAR OLD CHILDREN (Anthony Coletta and Kathleen Coletta).I don't think this is an awful book, but I was disappointed, that's all."
3,Good resource book,"The book indeed is a good resource of ideas : simple, clear-cut, straight-forward activities in specific centers. One of our teachers at the Pre-school simply loves it. She is totally dependent on it - as she cannot come up with her own creative ideas and cannot even make her own lesson plans. Good source of ""cute"" activities but does not indicate goals/objectives,concepts,target skills to develop,etc. Indeed, it is JUST a resource book; it is nice to have one if you're really stumped for ideas. However,if you need a book (with more substance) to help your kids appropriately develop skills they need - this is NOT it."
1,didn't need it - should have returned it,"you can find free ideas like this on Pinterest... I'm too lazy to return it. Also, If you want real curriculum, you will need to pay."
1,Wrong Number,"I received e-mail from the company that actually stocks and ships this product for Amazon. They informed me that the listing may say 12 items, but it should only be for 1. I was not asked if I wanted 1, just told that they would have to cancel that portion of my order, and did I want the other item that I ordered. Needless to say I cancelled the entire order. Maybe Amazon should proofread a little closer to ensure the correct number of items are offered."
2,Very disappointed,"I planned to send this book to a friend in Australia, as we were exchanging books on the most favorite birds of our area. There were only about 12 species listed and only 12 color photographs. Granted there was a lot of information about their habitat, but there were many birds that I would deem more favorite than those listed. What about the red polls and juncos? And they photographed a female blue jay, rather than the more brilliant male. I'd take a pass on this book."
2,Brookstone replacement cheap and easy,"Called Brookstone per comment below (1-800-846-3000). They had me in their system having bought it 4 yrs ago - who knew? Cost $12.98, with shipping $19.05, and is the same battery exactly (15 volt DC, 4 amp, not the lesser voltage/amperage of the one discussed here). Almost bought two, but figured I'd be ready for something new and lighter in next three years."
4,One of my wierder purchases.,I actually bought this because it is the ONLY readily available replacement battery for an electric start Toro lawn mower that I could find after almost endless searching. Worked just fine and the only reason for four rather than five is that it was so hard to find it.
3,Not as pictured,"This is actually a box with 18 packets of 6 mini Yorks. Still usable and good, but not quite what I was expecting."
4,Be careful!,"My copy of this DVD had defective audio (frequent popping sounds throughout), but what I could hear of it was excellent. Got a refund, but am reluctant to order another copy since another reviewer on this page mentions that he had no audio on his copy."
2,no audio,I'm familiar with Mimi's wonderful playing but was disappointed in this DVD. The audio for the performances and interview would not play. There was audio in the intro part but that's it. I ordered a replacement and had the same problem. Must be a bad batch. I had to send that one back too and request a refund. First time I've experienced this with a product from Amazon.com.
1,A Different Point-of-View,"I don't review movies, but having purchased this on the basis of a very enthusiastic review, I must offer a different opinion: the production is among the worst I have suffered through -- about the level of a 1940's/1950'2 sci-fi or western weekly serial. (At which time I was too young and naive to suffer.)"
3,Where's Notepad?,"Normally, I'm a big fan of Annette Marquis and her exuberant and vivacious writing style when it comes to learning about MOS. To say that I was a little shocked at the blatant omission of Notepad would be an understatement. I teach a bevy of technical skills that no doubt prepare my students for ""the real world,"" if you will. First and foremost among them, you guessed it, is Notepad.I know it may seem easy to some of you(and especially me), but to my youngsters, I ahere to the adage ""You can't walk before you run."" I guess what I'm trying to say here is that Notepad is a great starting block to build an impressive foundation that leads to the pinnacle of MOS Mastery(it's MOS not MOUS now, so wake up Annette). When I spilled cheese whiz on the part about using bold and italics in conjunction in Word, I was so [mad]. But, I guess I can remember how to do it o.k. now, I think."
4,A breath of fresh air...,"Ms. Grout's book is a quick read with a very down-to-earth tone. I have very much enjoyed incorporating her breathing techniques into my life - for example, several of her ""cocktails"" and deep breathing techniques are great when feeling stressed on the job, and can be done in a crowded room with no odd looks. While I know that my weight loss (35 pounds so far) is a result of new eating and exercise habits, the ""Grout"" breathing has become a wonderful addition to my routine - very stress-relieving and energizing! Nice work, Pam!"
5,This book makes me dance!,"I bought this book as a last resort after being absolutely fed up with starving myself and other such things with no lasting result. Even after the first day of doing this program, my lethargy is gone, my posture is better, I feel stronger and more energetic. I find myself dancing and singing in the shower as I do these exercises! I am definitely losing weight, but even if I weren't, I would still do this program; it gives me a new outlook on my day. An added bonus: I'm a trained singer, and these exercises work wonders for breath control! If there is one weight loss book you buy, make it this one. It's not only about losing weight; it's about becoming an overall healthy human being, and that's something anyone can appreciate."
1,I gained weight while breathing,"While following the author's instuctions, that is breathing in and out, I gained weight. Perhaps it was all the chocolate cake, cookies and ice cream that I ate. But gee I thought that if I was breathing like Pam said, I would lose weight. Oh well."
1,Not true science!,"This book leads one to believe that the mere act of breathing will wisk away the pounds. Hogwash! Proper diet and exercise are necessary to loose weight. Breathing is a natural response of the body to take in oxygen, nothing more."
5,Easy Science and Math growing up in the MacDonald Clan,"I think this book is strong in all areas. Its hard not to when the author is your mother. (Not to mention living through as a child, what is now in all her books and i wouldn't have had it ANY other way)Good goin' mom!JD"
4,Is it Windows that's causing the problems??,"I bought this CD-RW over a year ago, when I was still running Windows. It was pretty wacky then, doing all sorts of things to my discs and the OS! Dunno it that's the software or what...anyway last fall I switched my computer over to Linux and this burner has WORKED LIKE A CHARM! Linux users, note: Mandrake and SuSE both recognize this flawlessly. The program cdrecord will recognize it but won't let you use DAO ...however the app cdrdao works great with it (and it's frontend, gcdmaster)! I've burned over 200 discs with this burner I've bet and only a handful have been losers, and out of those I bet only 1 or 2 were due to things beyond my control. Cheap discs (don't get cheaper then PENGO I bet), pricey discs, all burn very well - some faster than others (the Blacks are the slowest at 2x, TDK or Fuji the fastest). I would buy Iomega products again."
3,Not too thrilled with this one!,"This burner is rated for 8x writes, and anybody who's up on CD-RW drives knows that means it should be able to burn a full CD in about 8-9 minutes. However, this drive typically takes 15-20 minutes to burn A CD. Tried the support section of the Iomega website, but could not find an answer to this problem until I read the other reviews here at Amazon that mention certain brand media is required to write at the full 8x.Well if Memorex CD-R's isn't good enough for Iomega, then this drive shouldn't be good enough for you. My Yamaha 8x performs great no matter what brand media you use, so I would recommend you take a look at one of those instead.I think I'm really reaching here to give this drive three stars, but it does work........more like a 4x with most media. I'd probably be more annoyed if it was slated to reside in my primary computer."
2,Had some problems with it..,"Some problems I had with this drive..excessive time reading a cd..sometimes it takes a minute or two for the drive to read a cd. When erasing a CDRW cd, it says erased successfully, however the files are still on the CD. And the most recent problem, when shutting down windows (xp or 2000), my computer doesn't shut down automatically due to the drive. if i disconnect the drive, then it shuts down fine. sometimes i can't even eject a coaster cd. i have to shut down pc, then start it up again to eject it."
2,Doesn't Last.,"Good for about a year, then dies. Minimal support from Iomega, but Iomega's not known for support."
2,Buy it only if cheap!,"It will write at 8x speed only on select brand CDR like TDK. Otherwise, EZCD software will show remaining time as 10min, but it will use 2 to 3 seconds to tick one time. I even get crazy when I have a lot of CD to burn since it takes 40 minutes to burn a STI CDR which was bought from circuitcity. 2M buffer is just half of the size than other 8x burner. Don't buy it unless it is free (after rebate) so you can use it as CDROM for your 2nd PC."
1,I've successfully burned 10 CD's in a year,"This drive is worthless. It works less than 10% of the time. I could not even sell mine used in good conscience. I've called Iomega, and they blamed the problem on everything BUT their product. I've tried all grades of disks...all brands of disks...all the ""tricks"" Iomega suggested. I have given up on this product! Do yourself a favor...AVOID IOMEGA. Pay more if you have to...just avoid this drive!"
2,More trouble than it's worth,I have had several of these in the office and have trouble with them all. 3 of them experienced premature hardware failure. 2 of them were discarded when the computers they lived in were upgraded and the software they came with no longer worked. I had to purchase new software from Iomega or go without them. It made more sense to upgrade to a faster drive which included software than to buy new software. I would reccommend you buy a different drive. You'll have less trouble. I have had other Iomega products also which were all prone to failure such as zip and jaz drives. Do yourself a favor and buy from the big boys.
2,Simply Awful,"Pro-tip - when your cast list and your production crew are exactly the same and are made up of THREE PEOPLE you're pretty much doomed to have a crappy movie no matter what you do.This stinker, which admittedly has it's heart in the right place, blatantly fails at everything it tries - mainly because it reaches so far. Acting is atrocious, dialogue is painfully fake and special effects are limited to strobe lights, fog machines, and unfocused lenses.Here's something fun: everyone take a drink whenever the main character grabs his face in order to convey an emotion but be warned; everyone will be passed out or dead within the first 15 minutes."
3,A great film,I really likes this movie. It's about the relationship between a father and his only son. The son marries against his fathers expectations. Life takes a turn and his son and sons wife dies in a car accident abroad. The sons daughter has to carry the heavy message of his son and daughter in laws death in such a way that it's not fatal for the father. Great movie! Kajols acting is excellent.
5,Great CD,I was given this CD by the band years ago when my band played a show with them. Weed Metal at its best!
2,Let the Right Subtitles In!,"Does anyone know if they corrected the subtitles yet? I'd love to buy this but won't until they get it right. I would rate the theatrical version of the film 5 Stars but until they fix the subtitles, I can only give the home video version 2 Stars. The book, however, is also 5 Stars and surpasses the movie."
2,Badly dubbed,"Stiff acting,awful dialogue destroy this DVD. Maybe the original subtitles could save it. But this edition is awful."
5,GREAT LOW BUDGET VAMPIRE MOVIE,Movie itself: 5 starsVideo quality: 4.5 starsAudio quality: 4.0 starsExtras: 2.0 stars
2,Poor Translation,"My wife is Norwegian and is therefore not bound to the subtitles in this film. According to her the translation of this film is about as incoherent as having a three year old explain ""Crime and Punishment."" Knowing this makes it dificult to enjoy this film as much as you should."
5,"""be me awhile""",The best film of 2008.The best film in the last 5 years.the best vampire film ever made.Available with English subtitles for adults who can read.
4,"let me in ,but with out the glam","personally i think this one was a little better than the newer let me in, the story was about the same, the subs were not great but they didn't kill the flick, the acting was pretty good, if you have seen the newer version then you might not like this one,i say that cuz there are no subs in the newer film, the movie is shot in higher grade film and all the effects were way better,i guess this one's for all the people that don't mind a lower budget film with a great story."
2,"If you loved this at the theater, HOLD OFF on buying the DVD!","It's now well documented-that Magnolia/Magnet did NOT use the original theatrical subtitles, but simplified, inferior ones of their own devising:http://iconsoffright.com/news/2009/03/let_the_wrong_subtitles_in_to.htmlMagnolia/Magnet has promised to re-release with the original subtitles, but until Amazon changes ""English"" to ""English (theatrical)"" in the subtitles available, better steer clear of this as a vampire would a roomful of cats.By the way, if you're one of those who pre-ordered to get this DVD as soon as possible, you'll either need to pony up for the re-release or learn Swedish -- Magnolia/Magnet has refused to exchange the first release for the new one."
1,WAIT FOR THEATRICAL SUBTITLES!!,"This is an amazing film brought down low by lazy distributors not paying attention to A. the integrity of the dialogue, and B. the fans. For a explanation of how they screwed the pooch:http://iconsoffright.com/news/2009/03/let_the_wrong_subtitles_in_to.htmlThe sad thing is that I bought this first pressing before realizing the problem and Magnolia/Magnet are not letting people exchange the film for the next pressing. So lame..."
1,Manolia/Magnet's a POS for not letting us exchange,"I loved this movie and wanted to show my support for it by preordering two months ahead, and what I got was a kick in the face. As many others have explained, it mainly has to do with the retranslated subtitles, which blows hard. The extra contents was weak too, to add salt to the wound. And now they're saying they won't exchange for something they screwed up. What a POS move. I won't support this company again."
1,A Great Film Ruined by the US Distributor,"As others have said, this film is great. Unfortunately, the version as released by Magnolia/Magnet is not true to that seen in US theaters. For a good side-by-side breakdown of the differences, search for the Icons of Fright website with the title of this film. I want to give the film five stars, but this version does not deserve it. For a great film, wait until it includes the original English subtitles on the disc. The distributor has said that, when released, the version with the theatrical subtitles will say: SUBTITLES: ENGLISH (Theatrical), SPANISH under the technical specs on the outside of the box."
1,Excellent movie ruined by revisionist subtitles,"The DVD and Blu-Ray's subtitles are new, dumbed down versions which substantially ruin the film."
1,Beware,"One of the best films ever. however, this blu-ray destroyed it. this is not the theatrical release. this is a version made for the masses of illiterate that cannot watch a film unless english is spoken. the entire film was ruined by the awkward english dubbing."
4,atmospheric and solid film,"i've not much to add to the other reviews, but i do want to say this film very much captured what living in europe is like. the visuals and the quiet strangeness of the film really struck a chord with me. i am a sucker for atmospheric horror films, and this hit the spot.the story, characters, acting, and directing are all superb. an odd little tale with an authentic setting.whether you are into the vampire craze (i am not) or not, this is a quality film well worth watching."
4,Beautiful Movie; Happy ending... sort of,"I watched this movie, having heard about the American remake and being interested in the original.Cinematography is beautiful, script is masterful, if minimal, the acting is believable, and the overall product is something I would consider artwork. Would definitely buy the movie, having watched the Amazon rental version."
4,"What A Vampire Movie Should Be (You Hear That, Twilight?)","The cover of this masterpiece speaks the truth. It is the absolute best vampire movie that's ever been made. A million times better than the overblown, badly written, badly acted, vampire-rule destroying, crapfest of Twilight. But that's not really hard to do. The House That Dripped Blood was a better vampire movie. I love this movie. Everything about this movie is perfection. The setting is incredibly bleak, which should be a given in every vampire movie. The characters are amazingly written and have wonderful depth, which is something that has been sadly lacking in recent movies. The subtitles problem on the blu-ray should be fixed by now. I ordered my copy on October 17th, and it had the correct theatrical subtitles. If you want a real vampire movie, you can't go wrong with Let The Right One In. Unless you're one of those weirdos that think Twilight is about vampires. True vampires DO NOT SPARKLE !"
1,Agreement with all subtitle complaints,"This is a film with a lot of loaded dialogue, carefully chosen words, subtle meanings. I've seen both the foreign-made subtitles and the domestic version. After watching the domestic version with ""redone"" subtitles, I was shocked at how much was lost in the process. I'm astounded that this was done in the first place, let alone approved and marketed.The new domestic subtitles are nowhere near as good... which makes this particular film a lot less intelligent and subtle. I'm waiting for another region release."
1,Let The Right One In,"If you saw this movie in the theater, do NOT buy this dvd!!!You will be very disappinted in it. The subtitles have been changedand they ruin the film completely.I am returning mine and refuse to buy anything else from thisproducer until they correct the problem, AND make arrangments for replacement of the bad dvds that they have sold to unsuspecting buyers.Amazon should file a complaint to the company as well, since, I believe, this also tarnishes their reputation.Again...DO NOT BUY THIS FILM!!!!!"
4,Much better than the American version - very true to the book.,"I just watched this through Amazon's streaming video (for free!) and was pleasantly surprised. I read the book about a month ago, and immediately watched the American version - Let Me In. While I enjoyed the movie, I was disappointed that so much of the book was changed or left out. This adaptation really was much better. I thought it captured the tone of the book, and expanded on several of the secondary characters much more than the American adaptation.I agree with other reviews that the dubbing was not very good, but heck, it's what I expected. The actors are not speaking English, so it's not going to be perfect."
1,FEEL CHEATED BY SUBSTANDARD SUBTITLE WORK!!!! UPDATED,"They obviously do not respect the work, the director, and most of all, the audience. That in this day and age they will choose to cheap out and use substandard subtitles, knowing full well that consumers will have an outlet to complain and therefore hurt their sales, simply means one thing: they didn't care! Well guess what? Now they will have to reissue this disc, or else it WILL HURT their bottom line. We have to take a stand and DEMAND they correct their gross negligence.UPDATE: Unbelievable. Just read the comment saying that they WILL REISSUE the disc but that they WILL NOT HAVE AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM for those who purchased their DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. So let me get this straight; those of us who love this film, preordered it, then pointed out their mistake, thereby saving others from a mutilated film end up being PUNISHED because of it? Magnolia, you're a real class act."
1,ORIGINAL SUBTITLES ON THE WAY!,"The film with its original subtibles is going to be released! The people have spoken!! Wait for the re release before you purchase this movie, it is worth it. No release date is set yet but I would be assuming it will be soon. Stay tuned!"
1,Dull...Dullllll.....Dulllllll!!!!!,"I have been a vampire movie junkie since before it was popular again so I have seen nearly of the ones out there, both domestic and foreign, which also include the worst ""B"" movies of all time (Jesse James meets Dracula, etc.) and I must say without a doubt this is the worst vampire movie I've ever seen. Ok, I'll give it one or two points for creepiness, but the scenery is ugly, the sets unimaginative and no magnetism from the vampires at all. To me a vampire movie is sucessful if you feel some type of ""pull"" from the main character - this one did nothing but push me away. I'm sure some people may like it, but not this one. Such a waste of two hours."
3,Decent Vampire Flick but way overhyped,I liked this movie fine but there's really nothing new here other than the fact that the leads are kids instead of adults. Visually its very haunting and beautiful and had I discovered it by accident one late night then I think I would have loved it. The reviews for this thing have been way too generous and it really built up my hopes. Its not a masterpiece but it is a pretty good Vampire film. For all its hype its really just a slightly new take on the same moody and depressed vampire story that You've seen many times before. Its worth seeing but certainly not the best Vampire film ever.
1,not just the subtitles,"This film looked entrancing; unfortunately, I couldn't watch it. I waited for the latest Blu-ray release from Magnolia, but that didn't help. The problem wasn't the subtitles because I couldn't see them. There was a time bar across the bottom of the screen that COULD NOT BE REMOVED. It blocked the subtitles. The dubbing track sounded awful and the bar was annoying even without the subtitles. And the authoring errors didn't end there. The menu at the end of the film was frozen - you couldn't watch the special features without restarting the movie, a real pain because there was no direct access to the menu without sitting through the crap that preceded it. All in all, this is another baboon authoring job that seems all too prevalent on Blu-ray discs (but very rare on DVDs). A pity, because this film seemed to be very impressive. Unless Criterion rescues it, I guess I'll never know for sure."
3,"I liked ""Let Me In"" better","I have read articles and reviews by individuals who said ""Let the Right One In"" was better than ""Let Me In"". Lest you be confused, ""Let the Right One In"" is subtitled, while ""Let Me In"" is in English. I prefer the latter. They are both based on a book by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Both follow the book fairly closely. The difference, to me, is purely a personal one. I like Richard Jenkins (Six Feet Under), and he only appears in ""Let Me In"". I also found the portrayal of Oskar in ""Let Me In"" to be much more sympathetic and believable than in ""Let the Right One In"".Having said all that, you can't go wrong with either movie. If you prefer--or don't mind--reading sub-titles, then you may prefer this version. It is somewhat more faithful to Lindqvist's book in that it shows how Eli came to be what she is."
4,Compelling,This movie held my attention and drew me in. Lead actors are 13 but it's not a kid's movie. Dialogue is subtle. Effects are minimal but executed perfectly. And there's actually an interesting story.
4,How could you not have sympathy for the Eli?,After hearing a great deal of hype about this movie I finally watched it on Netflix and although it isn't one of the best movies I have ever seen it is definitely worth watching and I do not typically go for violent vampire movies. I do not even watch True Blood. This movie is very original - the only vampire movie where the vampire is a 12 year old girl. The two 12 year old actors who star in this movie were great and I see a work in the movies for them in the future. One of the signs of a good movie for me is if I really care about the characters. I cared about the two main characters in this movie one of whom is a 12 year old female vampire. I actually felt sorry for her a bit! How could you not have sympathy for Eli?
1,let the right MOVIE in...,"i've seen both...in the theatre and the dvd...do yourself a favor-wait. this one isn't even close.the distributer is waiting to release the theatrical version, not the dumbed down version.i hope directors and producers take notice to how this is being handled and act accordingly. i even heard let the right one in's director is upset, as he should be."
1,DON'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON YET OLD VERSION STILL SENT OUT 12/30/09,"This is a FANTASTIC film with a POOR first releaseAfter waiting until people saw the right version being shipped out, I ordered my copy. Well, Amazon is STILL sending out the old version of this Blu-Ray and now I am stuck with the WRONG ONE. The DVD / BLU needs to say THEATRICAL Subtitles, not English.Magnet / Magnolia has decided not to replace the incorrect Blu-Rays because they don't feel this is a mastering issue.Amazon really dropped the ball here. They don't have any information on their site to let you know what version you are getting. If you want the un-butchered version, buy from somewhere where you can see the version you are getting."
3,Let The Right Subtitles In,"Not only is this one of the best horror films of 2008, it is one of the best films of 2008 period. Which is why it is so disappointing to find that the subtitles on this particular edition are not in line with the theatrical release. Both the dvd and blu ray's subtitles have been cut significantly to make them easier to read. Beware of which edition you purchase, because the theatrical release is far superior and it is in the wild as well. Sadly the only way to currently tell is to by looking at the back of the case. The quality version will say: SUBTITLES: ENGLISH (theatrical). Happy hunting."
1,Ding-Ding! Wake-Up Wrong Version again,"I suggest the reviewer who rated this as the correct version wake up from lala land; this is completely the wrong version and now I am stuck with 2 BluRays because I re-ordered based on his review; thanks Josh.Amazon.ca should hauled thru the coal fires for this screw-up. By the way guys, I'm mailing you the shirt off my back also."
3,"Vampire, vampire in the night","MILD SPOILER ALERT:Well, I've seen this - the original version of the film - and the U.S. version calledLet Me In [Blu-ray] and I liked the U.S. version better in almost all cases. I thought the casting for the U.S. film was superb. I liked Eli (although not as much as Abby) in the Swedish version but Oskar, with his nose running all the time, I could not stand.I thought Eli's eyes were great. I liked the scene with the crane taking the body ice cube out of the frozen lake. I liked the acid burns better. But, all in all, I much preferred the U.S. version.Both versions (and this one gets the major kudos since it was the original) are unique, very frightening, have well-done cinematography and did I say they were scary?"
3,Worthy Add to Vampire Fans,"This is a smart vampire movie, deeper than Lost Boys and not as teen drama romantic as Twilight. The children and their relationship is well presented and the brutality is well placed in my opinion. If you are tired of the Twilight type of vampire give this a shot, it brings some of the horror back to the genre."
2,"This is NOT the right one to let in, into your DVD player","I bought this movie based on NPR's (National Public Radio)recommendation. (Usually a good source for intelligent, interesting movies; however, this movie is neither). Now, the movie was very shallow, generic, predictable, and greatly lacking in imagination. All the characters lacked depth and intelligence. This movie was plain and simple a case of ""what you see is what you get."" Often you see a movie and think it will get better; well, this is one is one of those that never gets any better. You see the first five minutes and that is as good as it gets.No mystery, no intrigue, just plain: kid bullied at school befriends vampire girl, vampire girl protects him and, in one of the most anticlimactic endings, kills the bad kids. That is the whole movie, a great, great disappointment."
1,Just awful,"To begin, I love Vampire movies of all kinds. It is a guilty indulgence of mine. I have found something in almost every one I have seen from old black and white to the current day to enjoy. For me this was just awful, it was sad, it was draining to watch, and it seemed to last for many more hours than listed. I didn't find it touching, disturbing perhaps, for the first time I had to actually force myself to watch it all the way through. Were the people who gave this movie so many stars sure that this was the movie they watched?If you want to see it I would offer you my copy, but, that seems too unkind to do to a stranger."
2,Sloooooooooow,"I will start by saying I am a total horror/gore fan. I was not impressed with this movie at all. I thought it was too slowly paced and pretty boring at times. I don't see how a few kills make up for minutes upon minutes of boring dialogue. I was not interested in the artsy fartsy scenery or child to child conversation and just found this movie to be painfully dull. My husband thought it was OK, I have to disagree. As a matter of fact, I gave this movie 2 stars and that's being kind."
4,One of the most believable,A movie on this subject has to either suspend belief or become real and in this case this movie became believable. The ending was what really made this a classic and sold me although all through you could feel that this could have happened.
3,Let The Right One In,"My niece suggested the film as she knows I get into vampires, but I've got to admit I've never seen one like this. I can't say I enjoyed it, but I also can't say I didn't. It was disturbing to see a child vampire as a lead character. The relationship between the boy and the girl was endearing if not a little discomforting. After viewing the film I gave it to my niece who really, really likes it."
1,terrible,"I bought this because of my fondness for vampire movies, and because of the great reviews. my copy is dubbed, and maybe that's what's wrong with it, but it was terribly boring, almost beyond boring. unfathomable, the positive ratings. maybe it's that the dubbing was so wooden(as it usually is) but I wouldn't recommend this to anybody."
2,"A good attempt, but a definite rental only.","As a person who has seen this movie, the recent remake, and actually read the book, I can say that this was a good attempt to bring the novel to life, but it falls short. There are so many events and characters that are left out of the movie. It really only focuses on Eli and Oskar ( Abby and Owen ) just like the remake. Most of the disturbing content has been removed (the pedophilia , the flashbacks to Eli's childhood, Virginia's dilemma, the hunt for Harkan (spelling), etc... )However, I must confess that I am not a fan of most foreign films, as the lighting, actors, and all the minor details that make a movie come to life as usually of lesser quality. I found this to be the case once again. If you liked the 2010 remake, which I loved, then this movie is a little closer to the book, but not enough to make me want to watch it again."
2,Disappointed with the movie version,"I read the book and was really excited about the DVD coming out, so I pre-ordered it. I will have to say that I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money. The book is hands down much better. It is like all the BEST parts of the book were cut from being in the movie. There are so many areas that the movie strays away from the books original plots that I don't even know where to begin to give examples."
5,"Brilliant filmmaking, mysterious film, poignant story.","""Let the right ONE in"" is poetry on celluloid, it is one of those rare gems that comes along only once in a while. I am not a big fan of vampire literature, but this story is so beautiful and the film is so well done that it will hunt you for a long time. It will hunt you, I might add only if you are open to non-conformist, exceptional and personal cinema. It was a small US release in 2008, and not surprisingly it was overlooked by the Oscars Group. Is it a horror film? It could be. A love story? Definitely. Thriller? Not really. It is a film full of surprises, enigma and metaphors. Especially, I love the brilliant music by Johan Söderqvis and the two fine young actors playing Eli and Oscar. The cat scene? Just have a great time watching it. The end scene? Always remember, what goes around comes around, but most importantly, as much as possible, or whenever possible: let the right ONE into your life. Simply brilliant filmmaking."
3,slow-paced Swedish kid vampire flick,"That's an accurate description. It is for adults but it features kids, one of whom is a vampire. You should listen to it in Swedish and read the English subtitles, since the English dubbing is horrible.The film is very slow paced as well, so you will have to endure that or else hit the FF button on your remote.The swimming pool scene towards the end is probably the most chilling scene.Where is Oskar headed at the end?"
3,Disappointing and overrated!!!,"I consider myself open-minded when it comes to viewing movies of different genres; I do like all kinds of movies. When I read the review of this movie on [...] which gave it a rating of 97%, I was excited about watching it. BUT, when it finally came to it, I have to say I can't think of a more boring and slow paced movie that I have seen in the last ten or so years than this one. The pacing was extremely slow (worse than Peter Jackson's King Kong) and the acting was average at best. The way in which the bullies and the main character were portrayed, in my opinion, were simply not believable. However, I thought the girl who played the vampire was the star of the show. The overall story was okay for a vampire flick, but I'm just still puzzled how it was so critically acclaimed as it was. In conclusion, I still would say it is worth the one watch, but you're better off renting it and saving yourself the twenty bucks from buying the DVD."
3,;0),its an ok movie not bad but still watchable but for the English version with subtitles or dub is sooooooo bad that kind of prevented me from enjoying the movie. its a bout a 12 year old boy who is being bullied befriending a girl who looks his age but is not she is a vampire.
3,the book was WAY better then the movie.,"This title was recommended to me by a friend who did not read the book, but loved the movie. I purchased the book first and got through it quickly because i enjoyed it so much. I was excited to purchase and watch the movie when I was done reading, but was disappointed."
2,Movie does NO justice to the book,"Having read rave reviews of the movie and the book, I read the book. It's very, very good. Finally watched the movie last night -- very disappointed. The story is chopped up and abbreviated (necessarily so, I guess, to get it into movie length), but for example: the story of Hakan -- absolutely central to the book and running from beginning to end -- is nearly discarded in the movie. And the stories of the gaggle of drunks -- Virginia et al -- is poorly addressed also.The book is wonderful. The movie - not so much. I guess I could say it another way -- if you at all liked the movie, you should DEFINITELY read the book. It's substantially different and will greatly improve on and expand your interest in the movie."
4,Twelve Forever,"I didn't like the casting of this film, I didn't like the amateur acting, and the script had too many holes in it.So why have I watched it four times?Yeah, it's one of those films your brain gets locked into."
1,not the right subtitles,"Not happy to receive the older version and not the version shown on page. Page mentions: Subtitle Details: This product features the theatrical version of English subtitles. Version received does not have theatrical subtitles, has different cover art, and is a Canadian import copy. Returning for refund, will have to search elsewhere for corrected version with theatrical subtitles included. Old version has dumbed down subtitles with poor translation."
3,"Good, strange, long","I liked it, unique twist on a vampire tale but it was hard to tell what was going on. I didnt quite get a good understanding of the characters, maybe due to the dubbed dialogue which I do not like. I tried to get the subtitles via the menu but for some reason that did not work.I loved the lead boy, he was very good.Excellent cinematography, and proof that you do not need a high superstar over blown budget and megacelebrity actors in order to tell a very compelling tale.I can not give it away...but i have to say, the very last scene was fantastic."
4,Awesome,"On Blue Ray this film looked great. The film quality was great, the sound quality was great and the way it was filmed was really brought out on a HD spectrum. The film has subtitles as well as dub voice over in English.In terms of movie story; the film was the 400 Blows meets the Ring meets Dracula. It was a cool idea and I'm sure the book is even more crazy. It was fun to watch and I would recommend it because it didn't use the typical shock thrills where movies try to scare you more with loud sounds and what not."
3,"NOT BAD, BUT SURELY OVER-RATED","I had great expectations about this movie. Even though I'm not very fond of vampire movies, reviews were very good and some friends had recommended it. As it turned out, it's just a good pastime, another film I won't be seeing more than once. Some teenagers, especially those who are fans of vampire stuff, may love it, though."
5,Let Me In,"this is a fantastic movie! A slow paced drama with an excellent story, and great characters, ""Let The Right One In"" lets you into its world. I bought this movie because I like vampire flicks, I had never heard anything about it when i saw it at the store, was just hoping it wouldnt be a waste of 30 bucks. This movie has such a real feel to it, it is very believable not at all over the top or hokey, they leave alot for the viewers imagination. Also no corny dialog or plot filling in there is a great deal of mystery and mystique created. When there is violence and a bit of the supernatural it hits so much harder because of this films realness. This is not for ""mainstream"" movie goers this is true cinema!"
4,Twilight For True Vampire/Horror Fans!,"WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH SUBTITLES! DO NOT WATCH IT DUBBED!This Movie Makes ""Twilight"" Look Like A Bad ""G"" Rated Movie. ""Let The Right One In"" Features REAL Vampires With Fangs That Die In The Daylight, Instead Of Sparkling Like In Twilight (Wow). And It's Actually Really Cool To See Very Young Vampires For Once. Anyway, Just Give This Movie A Shot, It's Definitely Worth Seeing (Remember, Only With Subtitles)."
2,"Great Movie, Poorly Dubbed",When I bought this at Best Buy I was SO excited because it was only $9 and I hadnt seen it since the theaters..well it was too good to be true. The Dubbing is terrible and reminded me of the Asian martial arts movies everyone used to make fun of. It ruined the experience for my boyfriend who hadnt seen it before!
1,Consumer Fraud Alert,"Magnolia replaced the subtitles from the theatrical version. The ""new"" subtitles completely butchered the movie for those of us who saw the theatrical version. The changes they made completely undermine character development and the dark humor that permeates the relationship between the two protagonists. After reading the outrage on the blogs, Magnolia decided to release the DVD with the theatrical subtitles, but you have to look closes at the back of the box to see that it says ""Theatrical Subtitles"". Definitely wait until you are sure you can get the theatrical subtitles because Magnolia and an incredibly inept consumer relations ploy will not allow you to exchange the fraudulently released version.This is NOT Amazon's fault...they did not have any involvement. Amazon remains my favorite shopping experience. Maybe they will accept returns(?)"
2,Subtitles really do make a difference,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. So much so that I'm returning my copy of it. I saw the movie in theatres, and found it masterful. The amazing tone is part of the beauty of the film, and the subtitles on the US DVD release are a travesty. They remove most of the subtlety from the tone and characters (see http://iconsoffright.com/news/2009/03/let_the_wrong_subtitles_in_to.html for examples). The movie I saw in theatres was a masterpiece; the movie on this DVD (using subtitles) is a mediocrity. If you are going to buy this DVD, either download and use the theatrical subtitles or use the mediocre dubbing track. As for me, I'm going to look for another region's copy or wait for a re-release.In the end, this DVD is a masterclass on why good subtitle translations are critical in foreign films."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!,"THE DVD SUBTITLES ARE POORLY, POORLY TRANSLATED AND RUIN THE MOVIE!!!!Magnolia/MAGNET refused to pay for the original translations and hired there own in order to cut costs. I encourage you to write Magnolia/MAGNET and demand a re-issue with the correct subtitles, and a refund for your defective DVDs and Blu-rays"
1,"Fantastic Film, Terrible Subtitles","I love this movie. I've watch this movie eleven times at theatres including festival screenings. I couldn't hear the swedish language but I liked to hear them, and the subtitles were more than good enough to understand the meanings of the lines as well as the subtle diffence of the original language.BUT, this dvd has totally different subtitles. Problem is that the translation is terrible. The worst. Totally Irrelevant to the lines or situations. This ruined the beauty of this movie.The theatrical translations are dubbed into English voice. What the hell is matter with Magnolia? Why didn't they just put the same translations into subtitles? Magnolia Home Entertainment, You disappointed lots of fans of this movie."
1,Put the correct subtitles back,"Until the issue witht the subtitles is corrected and labeled as such so I know what I'm ordering, I will be have to pass on ordering this excellent film."
1,WARNING THIS DISC IS DEFECTIVE!,"1) the translated English subtitles are changed and do greatly mutilate the experience that the theatrical subtitles provided. Magnet films has acknowledged this but will offer no exchange program and has refused to stop distributing this defective disc.2) the disc is defective in that there is a subtitle selection other than English called, ""narrative English"" and it is completely blank. There is not a single subtitle on that track. Magnet released a defective product then said it wasn't defective just creatively manipulated because they didn't want to pay for the very well done theatrical subtitles. If you must own this movie now go buy the region free Swedish release. it has the theactrical subs intact."
2,Movie is fantastic; translation is horrible,"I was recently informed about how the translation done for the DVD release of this film was changed from a narrative translation to more of a literal translation, taking away some important aspects of characterization from the poetry of the language. There are some points where the translations have characters saying things that don't even make sense the way that the wording is done. Apparently, the distributor cheapskated out when it came to buying the translation that was shown in theaters (which was fantastic; as I saw earlier this year). I hate to downgrade a movie that I loved so much, and the reviews on the cover are true as far as how great the film is. This is what true horror films should all strive for. However, the distributor really dropped the ball when a little bit of money might have gotten them much better reviews."
3,Twilight meets Insomnia,"The mood and tempo of this film is great - reminded me alot of 'Insomnia', which I loved in both the foreign and American versions. Slowly paced, set in a dark and snowy Sweden.The film is set in 1982, which is a bit odd, as its obviously not based on a true story nor is there anything in the telling of the story which really requires it, save an appearance by a Rubick's Cube. Maybe the original story was more timely.The dubbing on the dubbed version is fine for the two main characters, not as great for the supporting characters but its adequate. However, there are two handwritten notes between the main characters in the film which are not translated, which in my opinion is inexcusable, as one seems fairly substantial.As many will note, this is not a 'scary' horror movie although there are certainly horror scenes, some graphic. Its is more about the relationship between the two main characters - don't let that keep anyone from seeing this film, though, its a gem."
3,"THEY ARE OUT! LOOK AT THE BACK FOR ""ENGLISH (THEATRICAL)"" SUBTITLE OPTION","Let the Right One In is a wonderful film. I'm sorry to say, but don't buy from Amazon. If you want the original theatrical subtitles I suggest hunting at local stores. They are out! Check IMDB.com and look under the message board. Someone found the subtitles!!! They are out! Start looking unless Amazon decides to post a disclaimer which versions they have."
1,Boring and a bit kiddie porn,"I don't know which version I saw, but question how much the translation really mattered since I doubt there were two pages of script in the whole 2 hr. movie. I found it slow and boring and provided no background or answers. It was impossible to tell how the two kids had a relationship other than from loneliness.The kiddie porn reference is because the pasty little boy is shirtless in about half of the movie and then there's the gratuitous shot of the girl's naked crotch which was totally unnecessary. Since she has a 12 year old body forever, no duh that she's going to look like a pubescent kid, a shot of her body wasn't necessary (although I'm sure it wasn't the actress' real body.....one would hope) and added nothing to the film."
1,Aweful,"If you don't mind long drawn out forgien voice over movies, then you might like it. I watched about 30 mins and that's all I could take."
1,Pathetic,"Being a vampire fanatic I was really looking forward to this movie.I was so disappointed. It was just pathetic. The voice overs were pathetic and boring. It wasn't bloody at all or scary, it shouldn't be considered a horror movie. Sooo happy I didn't buy it, only borrowed."
1,boredom,This movie was two hours of pure painful boredom. It is a good thing it was free on Amazon or I would ask for a refund. d.o.g
5,No problem for English speakers,"The problem with the English subtitles is a thing of the past. In fact it's got dubbed English so there's no need to worry about subtitles. This is a very moving story, and hits home on so many levels. Like vampires? It's got mucho blood. Like rooting for the underdog? It's got all that and more. My girlfriend is a vampire enthusiast. She fell in love with this movie. As did I.....you will too. The Swedes...who'd a thunk it....."
1,Let The Right One In,"Stay away from this movie. Not only the worse vampire movie ever made, possibly the worst movie ever made. A complete waste of time. Giving it one star is being too kind."
1,Dreadful,"This movie is absolutely terrible. Do not waist two hours of your life watching this film. Poor sub-titles, no action, and a little perverted, too. I'd rather sit in a doctor's waiting room than to have watched this movie."
1,Not an Apple product; does not function,"The product I received was not ""by Apple"" as the description indicated. It was a cheap knockoff that kind of looked like an Apple adapter, but did not function when plugged into my laptop. I took it to the Apple store to test it, and they told me it just didn't do anything. I will buy direct from the Apple web site from now on."
4,"Great Price, Great product","great for hooking up a mac book to an external monitor. It works perfectly unless the cord gets bent, then it screws up the colors. Just be sure to keep the cord as straight as possible. Other than this it works amazingly."
3,Works,"I was a bit misled on this product, for I thought it worked with the Mac Book Pro. It does work on older Mac book versions."
3,works great but.......,"Works great but has a relative loose connection at the computer port. Just don't move it around too much or it will fall out of a macbook easy. Also this is my second one. The first one got banged up a little and went out after about 2 years. Be sure to handle with care and keep the plastic covers and keep the connections covered if you transport it around. I'm a teacher, so I take it back and forth to work and it got banged around a lot. Handle with extreme care to avoid buying another one. Probably this is the only place it's sold. It's hard to find it elsewhere."
1,Not very durable,"I had one of these and it began shorting within six months. Still usuable if you fiddle with it and set it just right, but not suitable for serious work where having your presentation go all green, for example, would be a disaster. But there aren't many alternatives. I may use the mini-dvi to dvi adapter with a vga-dvi adapter. Clumsy, but would probably work."
1,"Works well, but shorted out after 4 months of use","Title says it all. Observed that the monitor had a yellow and then a cyan cast. Wiggling the cable lightly would fix it temporarily, but a loud sneeze would ruin it. I noticed that others have had the same problem. I bought mine thru Amazon from Setec (CEcompass), and they promise an exchange within a year after purchase. Haven't heard yet from them, but I'm hoping for the best. This is the first Apple product I've not rated highly.Update Aug 26,2009 : CEcompass promptly sent me a replacement cable when I emailed them and told them about the problem. This seems like a reliable source for these cables."
2,works well when it works,"I use this cable to connect my Macbook to a 22"" Viewsonic LCD as a desktop replacement. It has been shorting every other day since i bought it. So every other AM I fiddle with it for about 15 minutes to get it signal the proper resolution to the monitor. Shame on me for putting up with it, but from what I read it's a common quality control problem with this cable - so shame on Apple. If the cable cost more than $20 you would see more bad reviews, but at $19 I figure people just suck it up and buy another one."
2,Poor customer service/ Make sure works with your computer,"Does not work for MacBook Pro and when I went to return it CE Compass made it tedious and then is taking 15% off for ""restocking."" Woops. Not a fan."
2,"wrong size, my fault",It did not fit my system requirement. human error (on my end). friendly customer service though! they were quick and helpful.
5,Great for my TV,"I had about 10 movies on my mac computer and I couldn't watch them on my TV. Well, this product helped me with my problem with great success."
2,Caveat Emptor,"I bought the adapter to use at home (Weekends Mostly) and within 3 months I started having issues with the adapter, Yesterday the unit went dead. I also own the Mini-DVI to DVI adapter which I have owned for over a year and have had no issues (With DAILY USE).Since I got the Mini-DVI to VGA adapter I noticed the Mini DVI side to be quite a tight fit, but expected it to last at least 6 months. Truly disappointing."
3,OVER PRICED AND SHORT,"For what you get. it's over priced and very short. It's used in conjunction with a Dvi-d dual link cable to connect a macbook to my LCD TV. It works ok, but like i said. It could be longer."
1,Wrong item,I was sent the wrong item. I specifically said that I needed a Powerpoint adapter for a MacBook Air and was sent one for a MacBook. Haven't returned it yet and still need the MacBook Air adapter.
1,This is NOT an Apple product.,"This is NOT an Apple product. The price and the packaging suggest that it is, but it is not. The mini-DVI end does not fit into my mini-DVI port. Even when you force it in, it still does not fit properly. Do not buy this adapter."
2,Necessary but not sufficient,"This works well enough, I suppose: you plug it into your Macbook and it makes a picture on your VGA monitor. However I find the quality of the conversion from mini-DVI to VGA to be lacking.I expect a certain level of inaccuracies using a VGA cable for an LCD screen (rather than a DVI cable where the signal can be digital all the way from the computer to the monitor), but using the identical monitor plugged into a true VGA port on a different computer, the display is much crisper.On my 1280x1024 resolution 19"" monitor, the pixels are visibly blurry. It's most noticable on text -- where black text appears to have a small halo of blur or other colors around it. Small text is nigh unreadable."
4,To what it suppose to do,"Nothing to complain.The price is as high as other apple product.But did what it suppose to do.However, be alert if you are running Lion or Mountain Lion OS X. The full screen app will look like s*** on multi screen."
2,they crackled,they are really pretty but almost my whole set crackled and turned yellow. I never put them in the microwave and i didn't put them in the oven or dishwasher. I have had them for thirty years and they started to get all crackly about 10 years ago which is a real shame i don't know if there is any warranty i don't know how to get in contact with the company. So i wouldn't reccomend any of their procucts.
2,Disappointed -cracked glaze,"I have collected these dishes over the last 20 years and they have been used very little. (Some of the years, I did not get them out of the boxes.) In the last several years, the glaze has cracked on lots of plates, platters and other pieces. This makes them useless during Christmas when you have guests. They are labeled ""oven, microwave and dishwasher safe."" They were never in the oven or microwave. I did use the dishwasher, but after I saw the cracked glazing, I only do hand washing now. I have spent hours on the web searching for contact information for the company. They surely do make it difficult for customers to contact them! I will not buy any more of these pieces."
2,Romance on the Orient Express,The VHS was definitely not in like new condition and the slip case didn't even fit the tape. The quality of the tape was not very good but I can't tell if that was how it was originally released.
3,Find Romance in Europe and never leave your living room!!,"This movie is just a nice feel good romance! It has it a good story line, that makes you want to back pack across Europe. It is filled with action, romance, and a secret, so big, that it could ruin the reunion of long lost love. The characters explode on screen and you won't have a dry eye after that last seen. You can't buy it right now but diffinatly Rent this one!!"
3,VHS Video,My wife has been asking for this video since we lost the original in a break in. She is happy we didn't have to pay too much for the replacement. The only downside to this is that it is not in a DVD. Thanks anyways
2,Microsoft Publisher 2002 creating Electronic Mechanicals,"Great book. Old and great way of teaching: learn by doing! The book IS great; unfortunately the accompaning CD is flawed. The book uses many files from the Cd to teach. Again, unfortunately, the Cd has files on it that will not open in Publisher 2002. Also the book instructs you to use files from the CD that are NOT on the CD. How do you ask for help from. The sellers say it is not their problem. In the last six weeks, no help from the publishers. So same old problem: software says it's hardware; hardware says it's software; and you are the one left with the problem!"
5,Amazing Series!!!!,"One of the best series to come out of the marvel universe in awhile. In this version the heroes are Captain America,Ant Man,Hulk,Hawkeye,Iron Man,Thor and the Black panther. This makes up a colorful team of superheroes. the Creators did a fantastic job of bringing plenty of the Marvel Villains to lite. Many of the story's include Hydra,Aim,Shield and other 1 time superheroes who will both be with and against the Avengers. I have the whole Series on my Ps3 and all I can tell you if you want a fast pace story's (which seems like the heroes never get time to rest.) Exciting villains and and great plots this is the series for you. Oh and it has the Hulk. Nuff said."
3,"Very Good, if....","Volume one and two of the Avengers are excellent and very well done, particularly in remaining true to the original comic characterizations of these heroes! However, if you are a Thor or Hulk fan (like me) you will be dissapointed as Volumes 3 & 4 reduce these powerful heroes to merely back up roles in favor of Ironman, likely due to his live action box office successes, and essentially equalizes all the characters to the ""team concept."" Obviously, Thor and Hulk are the only members who have the true superpowers, but this is dramtically played down in each episode. Otherwise, good series and I do recommend it for all Marvel fans."
1,Volume III ???,"I think by the time volume III is published (if ever), volumes I and II will be obsolete and out of print. I suckered myself into thinking all three volumes were in print when I bought the first two. This baloney about volume III has been going on since 1997. The set is worthless without volume III and don't even deserve the one star I gave it. I think Random House did not do us any favors by publishing the dictionary before it was complete."
5,Is the wait coming to an end?,"This is an indispensible book for writers and for anyone who loves words, but only if you're looking for something from A to O, since Random House dumped the project. Hope may be on the horizon, though. As reported in William Safire's On Lanuguage column (NYT Mag. 6/29/03), the National Endowment for the Humanities came up with a grant of $325,000 over two years to keep J.E. Lighter's project going, and Oxford University Press picked up the challenge. Oxford is now working out the contract details with Random House."
4,Why isn't this in our history books?,"I fear I know the answer to this one... what would we women accomplish if we truly believed in our possibilities? Timely reading. ""Women are the key to peace."" Time for us to take our place on the planet and bring justice, equality and an end to poverty. These ladies started what we now need to finish. A good read, though a bit dry at times."
4,A great point of view,"This is a very short and easy read. It is well worth the time although I would recommend renting it rather than purchasing it.I enjoyed reading a book told by a different point of view.I can only hope others follow up focusing on other specific ways for which people contributed to the Revolution: children, elders, teenagers, the educated, the uneducated, loyalists, libertarian, etc."
4,Good Book,"I enjoy personal stories of the Revolutionary War. This was a good book, but not as detailed about the women's stories as I thought it might be. It was more detail about the state of American and gender roles with personal stories thrown in. What prompted me to look for more Revolutionary times books about women was Founding Mothers: The Women Who Raised Our Nation by Cokie Roberts. Founding Mothers was a wonderful detail of how these women were raised and their roles in the revolution.The book Revolutionary Mothers did cover more than the white upper-crust, it covered Native American roles, African American roles, and both sides of the war, patriot and loyalist. Overall, I am glad I read it."
4,COWBOYS IN SPACE,"I enjoyed Jim Branger's book Forbidden Wasteland! I especially liked the way Branger followed two stories with different characters, yet he kept us in the point-of-view of his protagonist, Jack Carson, throughout the telling. Eventually the characters' stories converged, when they met up near the climax of the novel, and the action following was riveting. I called this review ""Cowboys in Space"" because it reads like a good old-fashioned Western, with good guys and bad guys, yet it's of the Sci-Fi genre. Very imaginative and a good first novel!"
4,Mystery and adventure in a sci-fi setting.,"Although I am normally not a sci-fi reader, I love mysteries combined with adventure. This book gave it to me. I did not put the book down until I was finished: I could not put it down.The underlying scope of this book touches on our own world, whether that be our environment, diversity, politics or just living in a rural environment, where one must always be aware of the power of nature. There is certainly an analogy with the West, branding of stock and riding to round-up the stock. But the strongest analogy for me was how the bearded priests, as colonizers, governors and enforcers, kept their populace ignorant and in fear so that they may be more easily controlled. But they were not unbeatable; many lived to enjoy life without repression.What the author does not make up in award-winning prose, he makes up in his storyline. I recommend this entertaining, fast-paced read."
1,Awful,"Porno movies from the sixties have more production values, kindergarten plays display more thespian skill, and interpretation of original work would be more accurate if performed by intellectually challenged rhesus moneys. Unworthy of even a viewer with kitsch in mind or on serious hallucinagens."
1,Terrible!,"This movie DOES NOT stream from the internet properly. You are only able to view the introduction and a few seconds of the first act. As noted by a previous reviewer, the introduction misses the entire point of the original text."
5,I BELIVE IN THE POWER OF DEEE-LITE,"With much regret the final cd of one of the best, if not the best group in the world when it comes in to house music, has finally arrived and it was such a soul meal to my ears and heart. It brought back so much memories of my teen years and the hunger I had back then to what now has come a diverse genre of house music. The collection is one of the best I have heard in years from any dance act and if you dont have it, YOU MUST GO OUT AND GET IT!!!"
4,Deee-licious,"Overall a good hits package. First 7 tracks are from ""World Clique"". That's represented well. The next 4 are from ""Infinity Within"", and the last 9 from ""Dewdrops in the Garden"". I could have had a couple more from ""Infinity Within"", like ""Runaway"" and ""I wont give up"". Those are great songs and ""Runaway"" was a single I think. The last 8 tracks are good, but not as catchy and dancy as the first half of the disc. Had this taken from each album a bit more evenly it would have been flawless. But there is no deee-nying that having ""What is Love"", ""I had a dream I was falling through a hole in the ozone layer"", and ""Say Ahhh.."" on the same disc, is deee-lightful!"
5,Here she is!,"My shooting star! selena of the Amazon women:writing about the Goddess for us fledgling little witches:""The Goddess is alive and Magic is afoot"" someone once said..Little [...] and good children alike will learn from this crone of a woman! Sexy! Mama why dOn't you write us a bunch of stuff about the goddess.."
3,Eurasian Odyssey Review,"I own all of the Globe Riders videos and have to say this was my least favorite. It's still a good movie and worth buying, but it lacked the ""awe factor"" from some of the other films. The best part of this film is its emphasis on trip & bike preparation. I'm still a loyal fan, and would recommend anyone purchase the film. I won't be giving my copy away anytime soon :)"
5,the perfect fuse for the air hose,the fuse was for a portable Black/Decker Tire air pump couldn't find the fuse replacement anywhere else. I used some foil til I received the fuse
5,"Quality product, works as advertised.","Great not just as a heat insulator, as a spacer it was what I needed to adapt a new Edelbrock carburetor to a vintage car."
2,Disappointing,"I bought the book from a radio ad. It started out quite promising, but half way through it took a turn that left me feeling misled. There were a number of editing errors, which also detracted. I did have sufficient interest to read to the end."
1,"Bad Girl, Bad Bad Book","Surely this is not the worst book that I ever bought, but it comes close.The writing style is simplistic; the characters lack development, and most of all, the prolonged descriptions of the decapitations are unnecessary to plot development.Too bad there's no way to give it no stars."
5,Loved it!,"I am a big fan of Michele Jaffe's historical novels, and I've been waiting eagerly for her next book to come out. Bad Girl doesn't disappoint -- in fact, I think it may be my favorite of all.Bad Girl covers completely different territory -- modern-day Las Vegas -- and it does so with style. The characters (especially Windy Thomas and Ash Laughton) are great, and the plotting is really tight, with a number of unexpected twists and turns that heighten the suspense. Jaffe also clearly knows her stuff when it comes to forensics; she manages to weave in critical facts and detail with grace and wit.All in all, a fabulous mystery/thriller with a healthy dose of romance. I highly recommend it."
3,A little too violent...,"I know the author was depicting an incredibly violent time and place in history, so it was probably hard to avoid some of the more grusome scenes. I love historical fiction, but there were several places in the book where I simply had to skip ahead because it was just too, too much. So be warned: It's a pretty good book but you have to have a super-strong stomach."
5,This is one of the best books I've ever read.,"This story is one that does far more than give an entertaining, deep, beautiful story, though it does that hands down. It also gives more than a better idea of what the Assyrian people were like than any other book will ever give you. This story is about everything that makes us human; the loyalty, betrayals, love, pain, sorrow, and so much more. It makes you understand exactly what power can do, the lives it can ruin. It is complex, invovled, and once you start reading it, you'll be up till two in the morning."
2,Do Not Waste Your Money,"The art is this TPB is so-so. You can tell what you're looking at but it could have been much better. Then there's the stories... I was expecting something along the lines of John Sable FreeLance, but instead got 3 stories that would have made so-so episodes of Law & Order.Save your money and buy something else. If you're still tempted to buy this TPB, check it out at your local comic book store first."
5,Great leash!,"I've only used it a few times, but so far I really like it. I'm training my puppy for search & rescue and tracking. Going through all kinds of terrain, my cotton leashes were covered in all kinds of stickers & vegetation and leather is expensive and needs to be conditioned. This leash doesn't need anything done to it and it doesn't pick up stickers like the other leashes which is fantastic! It feels like it will last forever! I'm very happy with this purchase."
3,"some good ideas, but pretty basic","There is not too much in here that you haven't heard before, but there is a lot of questions so you can quiz yourself. There are some good nursing mini-articles that are intended to practice reading comprehension, and a few charts. Overall, I won't be reading this book again. It just wasn't that helpful unless you have a hard time reading and studying."
2,Very Light Workout,"I really liked the IDEA of this video, but like some of the other viewers said, there was a lot of repetition. Some of the movements are fun, but that didn't make up for feeling like you weren't really getting a workout. I'm not into super intense workouts, and even really like the idea of working out in bare feet, but it was way too easy. Also, most of the repetitive movements involve light bending of the knees over and over. I felt like it wasn't very good for my knees because they kept popping and making noise while doing the movements. If you are looking for a fun, very light cardio workout then I would recommend it but not to target the buns or work up a sweat."
5,Love Bollywood Booty,"I own the Bollywood Booty DVD and I have watched this entire ""Instant Video"" here on Amazon and, in both cases, have not experienced the difficulty with the audio as described by the previous reviewer. Everything appears to be in sync.With that said, I do love this workout. I own several of Hemalayaa's DVDs and she manages to come up with a different routine on each one of them. I am never bored with her workouts. I love the music as well. I just wish I could find out where she buys her fitness outfits, they're gorgeous!"
1,absolutely terrible,"I ordered this workout thinking I would enjoy some fun moves to cool bollywood music. It was such a major disappointment. The biggest issue is she is not even on the beat with her moves. For anyone with any dance or music experience at all it completely fries the nervous system to have someone leading moves OFF the beat. Either she has no skill in this, or the music is dubbed over the video and the editor really screwed up. The moves are boring and it isn't much of a workout...that is if you can even get past the first couple songs without throwing something at your TV."
3,Bollywood Booty needs more Bolly!,"I did this workout a few times. It is a good workout if you're a beginner to exercise...but if your already a frequent exerciser, this workout may be a little boring.The workout is VERY repetitive...which is great because you feel it in your booty...but it also becomes tedious and dull doing the same moves over and over.If youre a beginner, definitely try this. If your looking for something with higher impact that offers more conditioning, definitely try her other bollywood workouts!"
4,"Better workout than preview, definitely a keeper","On preview, I was not overly enthused with this workout but after finally giving it a try I found it was a lot of fun. Good for light/recovery days, you get about 40 minutes of continuous movement, enough that my headband was soaked when it was through. The pace is doable and the steps are very easy, though if you are uncoordinated like me, it might be a good idea to start with a belly dance basics DVD so that you can learn some of the movements as there are no actual ""how-to"" dance instructions. The sections are rather repetitive but for me that's a plus because I really need to work on my figure eights and hip bumps. (To be honest, I need to work on everything!) Hemalayaa has a stunning but approachable beauty and a warm deep voice--a joy to listen to even if her cues are not always where they need to be. She's a pleasant and encouraging instructor who makes the workout inviting, I'll be buying more of her DVDs."
5,let there be light and now there is,"I PUT IN A FOUR LIGHT OVER THE VANITY AND A TWO LIGHT ON THE SIDE WALL. USED 72 WATT HALOGEN BULBS WHICH ARE SMALLER THAN THE OLD 100 WATT BULBS BUT SEEM MUCH BRIGHTER..IT IS SO MUCH BETTER , WE ARE REPLACING THE MASTER BATH FIXTURES WITH THE SAME SEAGULL PRODUCT.THE CHROME IS EXCELLENT,THE GLOBES ARE PLAIN BUT PERFECT AND A NICE NEUTRAL COLOR.IT IS A VERY HIGH QUALITY FIXTURE AT A BARGAIN PRICE.WHEN YOU GET OLDER AND THE EYES ARE NOT AS GOOD,YOU NEED MORE LIGHT AND THESE FIXTURES REALLY DELIVER..MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE COMPLAINING ,IT'S TOO BRIGHT.PACKAGING WAS EXCELLENT AND ASSEMBLY WAS SIMPLE.THESE REPLACED MORE EXPENSIVE FIXTURES AND THEY LOOK FAR BETTER.THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.I HAVE THEM FACING DOWN BUT YOU CAN HAVE THE GLOBES UP.WORKS EITHER WAY. THEY WILL TAKE 100 WATT BULBS BUT THAT WOULD GIVE OFF A LOT OF HEAT.TRIED SEVERAL TYPES OF BULBS AND THE 72 WATT WORKED BEST.IF YOU HAVE THE SPACE TAKE THE MOST GLOBES YOU CAN IF YOU WANT A LOT OF LIGHT."
4,Quality Product,The quality of this product met and exceeded my expectation once it was received. This sometimes is difficult when purchasing online. I will be looking for more product of this line and brand.RL
4,"On befriending the world, including oneself","This book is a collection of talks given during a month-long meditation retreat, by an American teacher of Tibetan Buddhism. She emphasizes the cultivation of loving-kindness toward everything, including ourselves and our busy, crazy brains.When I picked this book up a number of years ago, the first sentence was just what I needed to hear: ""There's a common misunderstanding among all the human beings who have ever been born on the earth that the best way to live is to try to avoid pain and just try to get comfortable.""(I also highly recommend ""The Myth of Freedom"" and ""Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism"" by Chodron's teacher, Chogyam Trungpa.)"
3,"I love Pema Chodron, but...","I love Pema Chodron. I have purchased three other of her audio recordings from Amazon, and her warmth, compassion, and humor have made a huge impression on me and helped me in my everyday life and meditation practice.The difference between the other titles I've purchased and this title is that the other titles were recordings of Pema herself, in front of a live audience. This title is a reading of one of her books, narrated by somebody else. The warmth, compassion, and humor that have so helped me are in much shorter supply in this format."
3,"okay, not extraordinary",Pleasing enough to read.....not anything that avid readers of this subject matter will necessary relish.
3,Classic Buddhist approach,Good reminders in a long tradition. The sort of book you may enjoy dipping into occasionally. I prefer edge thinking.
5,The Art of Accepting and Embracing Life,"Based on talks given during a dathun (one month practice period) in Gampo Abbey, the contents of this book ""speak"" to each of us about embracing life's pain rather than running away from it, and about the down-to-earth benefits of practicing lovingkindness in our every day lives, both in formal meditation and informal meditation. The latter includes all aspects of our lives, and in this series of talks, the author shows us how we can utilize our own life's experiences as the source of our wisdom and compassion. Highly recommended!"
4,Self Acceptance is the Basis of Emotional Resilience,"Self Acceptance is the basis of emotional resilience. This book contains the background for two meditations that are useful to me. Hopefully, less is more in this review."
2,Low Budget,"I was dissappoointed with this dvd. There are so many different types of martial arts. If you are getting this to supplement something you are currently taking, make sure it is the correct form."
5,Truly Inspiring,"Recently I read ""Fire in His Bones,"" the story of Benson Idahosa. As an inveterate reader of biographies and autobiographies I found his story to be one of the most moving and inspiring ones that I've read in a long time.After a casual Internet search today (5-16-02), I learned that a private Nigerian University has been formed by him. What an outstanding life for a man whose father forbade him to go to school! Read it - you'll be inspired.Jake"
2,wrong product,item description and picture was mini dv to video picture showed composite and s video received a mini dv - svga adapter
1,Very disapointment,Never recived the product - got a knock off / wrong product in a used apple bag. I tryed to send it back and they claim they have not recived it for the trouble I wish I went to the store
4,Does what it says on the box,"Works as advertised - what more can you ask? The picture on my oldy fashiony 47"" tube telly is pretty great. I had a mini to rca for the audio, but don't forget to pick one of those up too or you'll be without sound through the TV till you do. The only criticism I have of this cool widget is that it doesn't seem to seat very securely. It's easily jogged and the weight of the unit itself could pull it out unless you have it all supported."
5,Works Great :),"I use this on my MacBook. Works flawlessly to hookup a TV via svideo. OSX handles this supremely well by remembering any video settings that I use when i have it hooked up. Plug it in and video switches to tv settings, unplug it and its back to normal. I use this with dual view mode so that my desktop stays the same always on the macbook, and i just get extra desktop space when I plug the tv in.The quality is quite suprising for s-video, very good.100% must have for anyone that has a nice tv :)"
3,Not what I expected,"I thought that, once I got this, I would be able to plug my Mac laptop into one end, my TV into the other end and watch movies from the laptop on the TV straight away. Not so. This attaches to the laptop and then I need another cable to connect this adapter to the TV.I also expected this to have the 3 RCA leads: left and right audio and video. It has one RCA socket, for the video signal. You will need a separate cable altogether to get the sound from the laptop to the TV. I can connect this adapter to the TV via S-Video instead of RCA but I don't think that S-Video does sound either.I still need to get an adapter to connect the audio output of the laptop to the audio input of the TV and a cable to connect this adapter to the video input of the TV.The three star rating is somewhat ambivalent. This adapter is not all that I thought it would be. I can not assess it until I get more cables and adapters. Only then can I compare it what it is and not to what I hoped it would be."
1,DOESNT NOT WORK WITH THE MACBOOK PRO,I am still bummed....I cant believe this doesnt fir the macbook pro...if the micro dvi to video is for macbook air ..what works with the macbook pro?
3,Decent Overview,"If you are interested in the history of England and the English people, volume 1 of John Green's work provides an acceptable overview of the period from the early beginnings of England as a people (c AD 449)through the death of King John in AD 1216. The choice of detail is somewhat quixotic throughout: at times the narrative is flush with detail, at other points whole years rush by in a single sentence. One assumes this is at least partly due to the paucity or abundance of source material, but on more than one occasion it left this reader wanting more.One major drawback is that I could not get maps to display, but as I am a fairly new Kindle user, the problem may lie with me, and not the device or the manuscript.Overall, a decent and informative introduction to early English history."
1,A Boring Book,"This book is a very small one, some pictures and they are all sketches, no actual photos of recipes in the book. Recipes are nothing to write home about and I would never had purchased this book if I had known how ""cheaply"" it was made."
5,Another great Dexter book.,I love the dexter series and this book is even better than the first one. I can't wait for the next on.
3,dark...with a higher ick factor...,"Still dark, still interesting but a bit too much talk and not enough action this time."
5,"Great book, great series",This is book two in the series and it's just as gripping if not more so than the first. I love the show so I started reading the books and I am not dissapointed. Dexter is a genius character and I hope Jeff Lindsey never stops writing these books!
3,Good but different to the TV series,Remember this first TV series was based on this book but many parts of the plot deviate from the TV series. A true Dexter fan will want to read the books. The TV series has so much more detail and is a much richer experience than a book.
4,Dearly Devoted Dexter,"Much better than the first book, though I wanted more of it.There were many times that I laughed out loud during this book, or had to re-read a paragraph or two to my husband just to share it. And at the same time there were times that I was actually squirming and almost felt like I had to put it down... almost.These pages turned themselves, and I'm excited to get on to the next in the series."
2,Insert Corny Title Here,"I'm a huge fan of the TV series, and as such the way I read the book was affected by that. Multiple times I find myself comparing the characters of the show to the ones in the book. That said, the book is good but simply not as good as the television series.I'll spare the plot summary for those who still intend to read the book. But overall, the book is entertaining but repetitive. There's little character development, and for most of the novel you'll feel like you're waiting for it to start. The climax is predictable, but wraps up neatly if it feels rushed.This is a good book to read in parts, or in multiple sessions, something to pass the time idly if you're an avid reader."
3,The best thing about these books is the TV show,"I liked the second book so much more than the first or third. Interesting serial killer character, some of which was borrowed by the show as well.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
3,Need a stronger editor,"This is not a book for the weak of stomach! The only thing that makes this book, and the first one, work and at all readable is the skill of the writer, and that's saying a lot. Dexter is a fascinating character, although I do get a bit tired of being continually reminded that he's not normal. There were some humorous scenes, which are skillfully included to make the other portions less horrific. However, this book was not as well done as the first; there were serious flaws with the plot and the ending was too predictable. Still, while I hope Mr. Lindsay's editor takes a stronger hand with his next book, I shall be waiting for it with a degree of guilt and morbid curiosity."
3,"Good, not great","I carefully waited until the excellent second season of Dexter's Showtime series ended before picking up this, but did so with great anticipation. Dexter is a very interesting and multifaceted character and I was eager to get back into his warped but amusing world.This second installment is still a pretty good read, but suffers from a sketchy plot that still worked well enough and sketchier characterizations of everyone except Dexter himself, that did not. This read like a pretty strong first draft that needed another run through the word processor to flesh it out.Still, Dexter's view of life comes through loud and clear, even though Lindsay could probably have winnowed some of his little asides out and added a little more plot and characterizations of the supporting characters."
4,Sociopath!,"Dexter the man who finds it hard to feel, in this story Dexter does not get down bloody and as dark as i have seen on the tv-series or read in Darkly Dreaming Dexter.He plays the role well as a caring brother and as a family man and loves kids but has he tries to keep up with the crowd but his sociopath personality is dying to kill. To kill those who hurt children and the rest of the scum that live on the grid. He is a superhero of modern times a sort of Robin Hood that robs the evil from the street. His arch enemy Doakes is pain in Dexters side in this novel, but he finds he will need Dexter more than ever. The hunt is on for a killer who dismembers bodies. This story serves up some more ramblings of Dexter's mind and dark humour, its not a tense or gripping thriller but provides a good dose of entertainment in Dexter trying to keep the Dark passenger at bay."
4,Dearly Devoted Dexter,Christmas gift for my son he loves them I love the price and the fact he got them in time for Christmas
5,Dexter,Very pleased with purchase. I am a huge Dexter fan and this book is the best. I received quickly and the price was excellent.
4,This book was a gift.,This book was a gift. As soon as I hear the reviews from my friend I may change to five stars.
3,Devastatingly Disappointed,"As many have said, my husband & I watch the Dexter series on Showtime so it's a natural that I'd be interested in reading the books. I listened to the first one a while ago and stayed pretty faithful to the series except for a few points, which I won't give away here.This one doesn't really provide much of a mystery, but it will get you annoyed at Debs (at least for me) for demanding Dexter help her at ALL yet never doing anything for him.Also, too many DUH moments for not just the police, but for the people in higher places who should know better.Plus, it was way too drawn out and internal conversations that have little to do with whatever's going on. And repetitive.At this point I'm just finishing because I've come so far."
4,Dexter does domestic Bliss,"Dexter finds himself happily after a couple of pedophiles. He discovers a realtor is abducting the children from the houses he has sold to the parents and killing thee boys after raping them. Dexter avenges the children, but also discovers that their is a accomplice.. a photographer.In the middle of His Bliss, avenging the needy, Dexter gets called to a crime scene, where a body is discovered with almost all the body parts cut off.Arms, legs, eyelids, lips.. and ect.This sets off a big invetigation and the Feds from washington coming in. Dexter gets involved through hi sister Debbie and becomes intrigued by Dr. Danco. Dr. Danco is a dememted surgeon from South America, who was imprisioned wrongly and given over to the enemy. He has gotten loose and now is hunting those who gave him away."
5,Dexter rules!,"Please read this book!Dexter rocks. Lindsay's portrayal of the character is dead-on. A classic sociopath, killer by nature.Great experience!"
2,The Show is so much better!,"I am so glad that I was introduced to the tv show before I started to read the books. The show is better and keeps getting better while the first book was good, the second was just very boring. If I had read the books first I would not have watched the show."
4,Dearly devoted Dexter,Ordered book as Christmas Gift. Came in time for Christmas and in very good condition.:Dearly Devoted Dexter
2,Deeply Disappointing Dexter,"I was not a huge fan of the first book, but the concept was interesting and some times a series gets better with each book. This may not be the case here. While it is not as forehead smacking dimwitted as the first, it is has it's moments of unbeleiveablity. How can Dexter be so attractive that women throw themselves at him, and such a good pretender of being human that he can be oblivous when women like him? The only women who was not attracted to him has been his foster sister, and I kind of think it might be only a matter of time. I also dislike how every person who is his foe ends up dead or out of commission. Are they going to introduce a new character to be ""on to him"" every book? This is not only frustrating but it shows that the author is completely incapable of developing any character or relationship longer than a few pages."
4,Don't Doubt Dexter: He never disappoints,"I just finished this book, and thoroughly enjoyed it.Pros:- Lots of action, very few slow parts- Deb cracks me up- Dexter's mind is interesting, as alwaysCons:- Somewhat linear Dr. Danco plot- Could have used an extra chapter titled Red Cowboy BootsI read the first book, Darkly Dreaming Dexter, at random back in maybe...2004? Shortly after that a friend was telling me about this great new show he was watching, and I thought it sounded very familiar... now I am a big fan of the show as well. It really is the best thing on TV since Rome and Deadwood.Check out the novels and the show. You will not be disappointed!"
2,Awful,This book was just ridiculous. So much stupidity. I had to give it up after 100 pages because it just annoyed me so much.
5,I love Dexter,This book is great. I love off beat stories and this is definatly one. I enjoyed it as much as the first and can't wait for the next one.
2,Not Worth It,"This book is a really bad read, although it is short so don't have any regrets. The story line is so badly drawn out from the get-go that I feel like it never really had a chance. They talk up the doctor and his acts the entire book and I feel it builds up to nothing grand by the conclusion."
3,All about the narration...,"The narrative voice of the second Dexter novel contains enough wit and charm to make this a breezy and enjoyable read, but one wishes the author cared enough to invent a convincing crime plot. The debut novel's plot was outlandish, and this one becomes a full-fledged cartoon. Dexter is one of those 1980s-style police characters -- the ones with seemingly unlimited free time, no administrative oversight, who near-single-handedly chase over-the-top crimes (and, as a self-described forensic lab geek, that's not even his job)."
3,Worth buying used,"Worth getting half priced for a quick summer read. Lot of potential, but the conclusion reminded me of writing college papers and getting so sick of the subject that I chopped the ending awkwardly short.Still, a fun read for a lawn chair day."
4,Better than the Showtime TV Serie (Caution!!! Spoiler!!!),"Great reading, always got you on the edge, with the suspense of what it may happen and the funny punchlines of our favorite sociopathic justice avenger. Try not to get confused reading it while watching the tv series you may see characters that are already dead on the book."
4,Almost as good as the first Dexter novel,"""Dearly Devoted Dexter,"" a sequel to the brilliant ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter,"" is nearly as good as its predecessor (I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because the 1st in the series is slightly better). The adventures of the likeable psychopath title character are just as engaging and revealing in this installment. My only complaint is that the plot, in an apparent effort to out-macabre the original, stretched my suspension of disbelief to the breaking point. The villain is so demented as to be almost a caricature. Nonetheless, I look forward to reading the next book in the series."
2,Disappointing Dexter,"Love, love the Showtime series, which prompted my reading the books.First Dexter book - great.This second one: I'm going to chalk it up to the stereotypical disappointing sophomore effort. I hope. Haven't yet moved on to the third book in the series, which may get Mr. Lindsay back on track.Dearly Devoted Dexter requires the reader to suspend belief too, too far. It's as if the LE characters are entirely free agents within their county and federal organizations, and have nothing else to do but work on this case in which one agent knows the killer but for whatever stupid reason, chooses not to share the identity with others. Not to mention all four characters agree for a stupid, unsupported reason not to alert target victims to their upcoming demise.And the little sidebar with young Cody as a possible pre-pubescent psychopath for Dexter to raise up in the Right Harry Path? Too much.There's enough witty prose to earn the two stars, otherwise it's merely Drearily Dismal Dreck."
2,Anti-climatic Dexter,"Dexter presented a clever plot that dragged along the way and had several aspects that didn't quite make sense. Like why would they allow a co-worker from the Police Department in effect stalk another employee during non-work hours. Sgt. Doakes did this and Dexter blithely allowed it to happen when he had a simple solution. And the ending was quite anti-climatic with the murderous villian, Dr. Danco - well, I won't spoil it by revealing it except to say, (shrugs)... Good work, but not overwhelmed and in places, bored."
1,Some things just shouldn't be written...,"This book is far too gruesome. It is a tragedy that this was even committed to paper. I gave it a chance, I read it to the end. I wish I could wash the horrible images from my mind. I will never read another Dexter novel and I will try to talk friends out of reading them too."
5,Dig Dexter Doing Deeds,"I loved the first book - a wild debut about a serial killer who by day is a 'normal' guy who just happens to have a Dark Passenger with him that prompts him to kill periodically. But only bad guys like pedophiles, those feeding on the innocent. He channels his desires to make the world a safer place. This time the plot does not include further adventures of Dexter and his brother, but helping his foster sister Deb, go after another nasty.While this premise is not the surprise the debut book held, we are chuckling what Dexter gets himself in - like getting engaged in a suprisingly amusing course of events. But it gets better when he learns some 'good news' about his potential step-children.All in all a good read. Keep 'em coming Jeff Lindsay!"
3,Definitely Dopey Dexter,"I appreciate the character. Dexter is one of the unique ideas in modern fiction. I appreciate the writing style, which makes the character (who is not human on the inside) appear human to us the reader, so it's not a Hannibal Lechter book.On the other hand, there is almost no character development for anybody but Dexter, everyone else is hollow. There is little plot development, and the pieces that are weaved together so well on television are all present, but not taken advantage of.The TV Dexter is actually better, which is shocking to me. That happens once in a thousand years. The characters are better, the plots are better, the whole structure is better in the re-modeled TV version.So i recommend reading only book 1, not this one, and buying the DVD's."
4,Fabulous Again.,"Well this one was as good as the first, although Dexter isn't killing much this time around. In fact I spent most of the book thinking, just KILL SOMETHING, Dexter!! :) That aside, it's just as amazing as the first."
4,dexter rocks!,"I love the Dexter series. The storyline in the books differs quite a bit from the television shows. I was surprised when I watched the shows how different they are -- still good and entertaining, but I like the books best."
2,cinema of death,"I AGREE WITH THE LAST REVIEW , I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.ADORATION WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT I ENJOY."
4,"not the best zao cd, but still worth it","Where Blood And Fire Bring Rest marks the new beginning of Zao, introducing vocalist Dan Weyandt (who in my opinion set a new standard for metal vocals with his hell raising growls). Songs like Lies of Serpents, A River Of Tears and To Think of You Is To Treasure An Absent Memory make this album a standout in the metal world, but is by no means Zao's best material. I highly reccomend their self titled, Liberate Te Ex Inferis, or even their newest release on Ferret Records entitled The Funeral of God. These guys are great at what they do and have worked through many member changes and other hazards a band in the underground music world may confront, but have survived. Support this band and buy their albums, don't steal off the internet."
4,a very good cd,this cd is not half as good as thier first two where all else fails and the splinter shards the birth of separation the main reason for the differece is that the original singer was a lot better and had a voice more suitable for this type of music althuoght this is still a very good cd i would strongly recomend one of the first two.
5,Zao who?,"This is the best album ever by the best band ever. Period. No ifs, ands or buts. Buy it. You'll love it (if you like heavy music)."
4,Great Guitar,"I actually have a special edition with a flamed maple sunburst top and gold hardware, which I think looks better and is also the same price. This thing is a really nice instrument. It's gorgeous looking and, despite being a budget guitar, can get gorgeous tone. I've got a 15 watt Line 6 digital amp, and it even sounds great through that. The pickups are '57 Classic Alnicos (I don't know what alnico means, but it's good), and can get nice warm jazzy clean tones, wailing electric blues, fuzzy rock, punk, and thick metal. It sounds awesome on the bridge pickup with full midrange and about 3/4 treble, just enough distortion to get fuzzy power chords, and a bit of reverb. I highly recommend this guitar."
4,After the Ambush,"Revealing, highly informative, shocking, but compassionate... Words fail me to describe AFTER THE AMBUSH, by Chuck Dean. His wise explanation about The Viet Nam vets and their Post Traumatic Syndrome makes total sense....it's spiritual warfare to the core, and can't be corrected or healed by ""conventional"" psychological approaches. The book is a needed reminder that must treat the whole man, not just the physical or so-called psychological.I heartily recommend this book for others besides vets. It is powerful and convincing that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the ""spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places."" It is must reading for both men and women."
5,Exquisite and Inspirational,"As a writer, I was given this book as a gift by my best friend. It is like no other poetry or art anthology I have seen. The colors, thoughts, images, and ideas combine to form a breathtaking view of life and all its idiosyncrasies. Wisdom shines through the pages. I highly recommend it."
5,Heart felt poems; exquisite art,This is a special book. The poetry selection is some of the best I've ever read. The art is diverse and lovely. A favorite of mine!
3,Great Collection of Poetry,"I really enjoyed the selection of poetry in this book. However, I found the artwork to be rather boring. My favorite book in this series is Art and Nature. I was disappointed in ""Time's River"" because of all the dead-looking flower art selected to go inside this book. It all depends on your taste I suppose, but to me there is an old, musty, artificial feel to the art selections here--so different from the other books in this series. . . ."
1,You're joking right???,"Well, I'm going to throw my design degree right out the window, cuz I should've bought this program and saved myself four years and thousands of dollars!Does the world really need another logo with a #^%@$ shwoosh on it???"
3,"A nice book, more of a romance than a historical novel",This is a nice book to read. It is more of a romance than it is a Scottish historical novel. I would recommend it for reading if you like romance!
4,Good reminder,"This was a good, short reminder of how depraved our country once was. I know we still have many miles to go in the journey of equality and justice, but we can praise God that that we are no longer living under this peculiar institution. This is also a good reminder to be aware of, and in defense of, those still in bondage in one form or another."
2,Weak and meandering,"I wanted to like this book more, but it's not great, even for the Tekumel enthusiast.The story involves the old characters Harsan, Trinesh and Naru, on a diplomatic mission to Salarvya following the death of that country's king. Harsan is written woodenly, and his two companions might as well not be there. The plot doesn't really go anywhere, and the key element that you think the story is going to address peters out unresolved before the book's conclusion.I hope the (eagerly anticipated) new books MARB is planning on writing will be more like the rather fine Man of Gold and Lords of Tsamra, and less like this (though I'll probably read them all anyway.)"
4,A must for gamers in Tekumel lore,"This is a product of gaming adventures and the flow through can be slightly crazed by this. Some things were left out and others appended. It is though, a very detailed Tekumel histography that shows the working relationships of places and peoples. For the gamer it has much for him to ponder. Are the Pe Choi and Hokun related? Pre-space or during the great technology era? Is it a Vulcan-Romulan relationship? Just one more fascinating aspect and their are many dozens to think on. It is more choppy toward the end, I think because the Professor was trying to get the whole story in. Still, read enjoy and play the game and hopeful write your own story of Tekumel. Thanks, Harry!"
5,Great Family Book,An excellent book and concept that every family with small children will benefit from.
4,Holding Back,"Having been a Police and Sting fan since grade school (thanks in part to my mom blaring Synchronicity and Dream of the Blue Turtles thoughout the house), I was really excited to read an autobiography. I read a couple of the Sting biographies. In the end, I found the autobiography to be less interesting than the biographies. Possibly because he didn't expand on some sordid details in A Tale in the Sting or maybe because he didn't deny them either. What I found interesting were the stories of his childhood, his work many stars like Miles Davis, and his mother's affair. It's worth a read. I am thinking of reading it again."
1,"Great musician, lousy book","I am a Sting fan, so I take no delight in saying, ""Ohmigosh. What a lousy book this is."" The way it flows (or doesn't), the point of view (super megalomaniacal), and the very language it uses, just put me off. The writing is pretentious. The stories don't come together as a book. And I found his point of view, three pages describing a gig 30 years ago, two sentences about the birth of his first child, kind of shocking. It would have been more apt if he called this a book about his journey in being a musician, not a memoir. Because unless you're completely OBSESSED with music, as he is, you feel that the ""life"" part of this autobiography is eerily missing. I take no joy in writing a negative review, but I admire him less after reading this. Borrow it from the library if you must read it, but don't waste your money."
2,A great musician who needs an editor,"I was a rabid Police fan starting back in 1980 and have admired Sting ever since. I knew when I bought this book that it would discuss his life before the Police, and that was fine. I was interested to learn more about Last Exit and Frances and his childhood, so I have no complaints with the content.But his writing style stands in the way of the story. It is pompous and egotistical with pretentious metaphors and a really annoying habit of switching between past and present tense. I could just picture him sitting there with a thesaurus trying to find the most intellectual-sounding way to say each thing he wanted to say.The foreshadowing ""teasers"" started getting to me, too: ""Little did I know then that this person [or moment or event] would change my life forever."" Over and over and over. Ugh.He really needed somebody to reign him in on this one."
1,I Used to Like Sting,"The story of Sting's life written by Sting. I thought he might elaborate on his teaching career, family life, etc. things the average person might not know about him. Or a biographer might not write as well. The story is basically full of the bands that Sting was in, where they went, what venues they played, etc. Sting never describes what it was like to be a father or what the kids are like.If you want to be private don't write a book. He also seems a little taken with his own looks, intellect, and talent. We all know that, you don't have to tell us and make us pay to read it."
3,Another person who considers himself supernatural,"Sting, like so many countless other people who have achieved financial success, has come to the realisation that his early life was not really random and in vain, but led by a divine being who would touch him to become the superhuman person he believes he is.I was excitedly going to buy this book until I saw Sting's performance and behaviour on the Victoria's Secret runway show. After seeing him perform his new single, I have to assume he is going through a severe mid-life crisis. What the hell was he thinking when he designed that song?? He looked absolutely ridiculous shaking his buttocks in that freak designer suit he was wearing. Backstage you could tell he was really full of himself and single again. His ""duet"" with a black female rapper was like trying to mix oil and water. I am really disappointed with what I saw and have lost any interest in reading about his rise from blue-collar hell to freak-show stardom."
4,another great memoir,"scar tissue is my favorite book about a musician, written by a musician of all time. this one has got to be #2 though. it opens up talking about his ayahuasca trip out in the jungle so we're introduced to a more provacative sting right off the bat, and i like that. are his songs family friendly? of course. but this book shows sting dropping f bombs and talking about psychedelic drug experiences so i'm in!"
4,Extremely well written,"It really should come as no surprise -- though for some reason it did for me -- that Sting would be an exceptionally talented writer. He clearly has a gift with verse, whether 3 minutes in duration or 300 pages in duration."
4,"Very articulate writing, Mr. Sumner!","I was very impressed with Sting's writing ability and this captivating book. At times, I could not put this book down and was very tired the next morning at work! This book is a MUST for any Sting fan and also for those who grew up in Wallsend and Newcastle. My mother was born and raised not too far from where Sting grew up and she wants the book when I'm done.The only reason why I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the first 15 pages. I was getting turned off in the beginning because it didn't seem like it started where it should, which was on page 16. As I read further, it was starting to make a little more sense why he wrote the beginning the way he did, but it may turn off some readers at first. I urge people to read further if they start feeling the way I did in the beginning...it is well worth it!"
3,"Good, dry read....","I have to admit it-I wasn't sure that I'd enjoy reading a memoir by an international music idol, and I certainly wasn't expecting much out of Sting in creating this work. His diction is very particular and precise. I used this book as my before bedtime wind-down, but found myself struggling to keep into it, as the language and general approach was extremely dry. I could only read a few sections of each chapter/unit and then had to put it down.Not terribly exciting, but it held my interest because I'm such a fan of Sting's music."
2,"Ok, but needs work :(","Overall this product achieved it's purpose - to provide me a replacement fascia for the stock radio slot to allow me to mount an aftermarket radio.Beware though, as it needs a lot of work on your part to make it fit properly.The color, texture and fit satisfactorily matches the surrounding it mates with.I would buy it again, but it is not as perfect as it purports."
2,Low resolution,The picture looks like its a high res film but I'd be suprised if it's higher than 240 resolution. It's a waste of money for a 1080 TV. Doesn't look at all realistic.
5,Magical Tool of Happines,"I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, so I thought you just put the wire in and the stipper cut it. Instead, you put the cable in, and give the stripper a quick turn (like a pipe cutter) and it flawlessly strips the sheathing. I dont' know how it never nicks the wires inside, but it never has when I've used it. I love this thing."
3,works great,"Simple, easy to use and store in my kit. It does not get more complicated than this. I wish it came in a different color."
5,Great jacket stripper,This product works well for the intended purpose. I've used them to make more cables than I can tell you and they are still going strong!
5,Overall a Great Tool,This is definitely a handy tool to have in your tool bag. it seems to do the job on most Cat5e cables. some brands of Cat5 that are a bit cheaper and are slightly smaller in diameter are kind of loose and difficult to strip. but overall very fast way to strip the jacket off and then you are just left with the string to trim and then your ready to either crimp and end on or punch down. seems well build for a plastic tool. easy to fit in bags and pockets and its priced reasonably.
2,Having trouble with the sound quality,"I bought this phone after reading lots of reviews. We had used the ATT 2 line phone and had a good experience, but needed to add more lines to our system. I have been really disappointed and wish I had stuck with ATT's product. I sound quality on the Panasonic handsets is really not good and one of our handsets drops calls regularly. I would probably return the system entirely if I still had the boxes."
1,Panasonic KX-TGA450B,"I am in the process of trying to get a replacement. Line 1 stopped working about 3 weeks ago, so I moved line 1 to line 2. Last week, line 4 started doing the same thing line 1 did right before it went completely out. Since I have three incoming lines, I have no more lines to substitute. This is my business phone and I need to have something done immediately."
1,the phone didn't work,The description said the phone was totally reconditioned and like new. The buttons don't work to dial and the button that answers the phone does not work. We will return the phone.
4,inadequate headset volume,Head set volume is inadequate when used with panasonic headset. Same headset with other phone seemed okay.
4,Portable required,"Office tasks required portable phones. Good , easy to use, but some listeners say voice quality a little muffled. Small price to pay for the convenience."
5,Works - no prob with WIFI,"Have used this with the base station. Really like it over the RCA or Motorola products. Amazon delivered - usual service.We have 6 handsets.There have been some complaints about changes to the product. We have found it to work fine. The transfer of calls is OK. Some things need to be gotten used to. All true.But as a pure phone, the sound is very clear for a cordless and this is KEY>Bottom line: works as a 4-line cordless and does that job extremely well."
4,Excellent system for small office!,"I purchased this system for a small non-profit organization that i was helping. Because they only have two to three folks, but three lines, i needed a system that had multi-line capability. It was fairly easy to program both the base and the handsets, but even with eight years in the Telco industry, i still had to read the manual! The phones seem to work fine and i like the conference feature that allows more than one person on a single line."
2,phone died after 6 weeks,"We already have 4 of these phones. We needed a couple of more for our business. However after just 6 weeks one of the phones is not working anymore.Sending it back is probably useless, since I am sure the warranty is no longer valid. Let alone how much the shipping cost would be.Just a little disappointed that they don't make things to last anymore."
5,Excellent product,"This phone system is excellent for my small home based business! This is my second model and now I am going on my second set of handsets. I have used these systems for the last 14 years. I have had the current set for over 6 years and my main handset's headphone jack gave out. This system has everything I need to handle my business. It handles 4 lines, and it even allows music to your customers while they are on hold, a built in answering system with multiple mailboxes, and cordless handsets with a plug in for a headset for handsfree and mobility while you are talking. This system has everything I need at a reasonable price for my business! Also, I received my new handsets in 3 days! Wow! Fast!"
3,one annoying feature....,"Good product other than when you have an incoming call while you are on the phone. It cuts the other person out and you have to ask your customer to repeat themselves, which is annoying if the phone rings more then once."
1,This collection sucks.,"19 tracks, 5 tracks from their best albums Korn & Life Is Peachy, the rest from the crap that followed. Don't waste your money, but buy cool metal music, like Pantera, Kyuss, Fu Manchu, or Tool. If you want to buy this kind of music, get one of their first 2 albums or anything from Rage Against The Machine or Faith No More. It is a 1000 times better!"
1,You are all sick people,"hey guys give me a brake,Korn is the stupidiest group I ever listened toThese guys without any talent at all. This is not a music, just a bunch of noise!!!You all need to see a doctor and immidiately!!!"
1,Sucks,"Worst album ever from the worst band ever, they just scream and are lucky if there are 5 different words in a song instead of one just repeated, every song sucks...period dont waste ur money get some good rock like Guns n' Roses or AC/DC"
4,My List/ Pros. Cons.,"My List:01. Word Up!02. Another Brick In The Wall (Parts 1, 2 & 3) (Live At Projekt Revolution) (from ""Word Up"" [CD-SINGLE])***03. One (MTV Icon live) (from ""Did My Time/One"" [CD-SINGLE])***04. Right Now05. Did My Time06. Alone I Break07. Thoughtless (from ""Untouchables"")***08. Here To Stay09. Make Me Bad10.

Freak on a Leash [Dante Ross Mix] [Mix]***Tracks I AddedOf coarse there's room left to add more songs but this would be my list.Pros:-New songs.-The bonus DVD is incredible. It blew me away. WOW! It's live at the CBGB in NY and the 5.1 surround is incredible. I never expected that considering it's only a bonus disc.-CD sounds good.-It's affordable.Cons:-Non really except for the missing songs. Get them if you can."
3,I'm dissapointed with this so-called Greatest Hits,"Over the last decade the only two albums that were excellent were the first two. They retire the band with TALITM which was supposed to but does not sound anything like old school Korn, and could be more compared to Fred Durst and his lame ass Bizkit. I have to say that they should of recorded a much better album (like their self-titled) and leave Nas out of it (He ruined the album!). That way they could of ended it without a downhill. Now this is just a friggin slope to the mudpile."
1,Korn off the cob,"Boy, Korn really sucks. I can't put it in much more plain english that this. Korn really sucks. I mean, they don't really sound good, with their bassist being all ""I think my bass sounds tough like this"".Korn was a stupid band to begin with. They lack brain power to even comprehend what is good. All they know is that they can't put anything out better than ""Right Now"", which was so bad that they shouldn;t have even put it out on the radio.The biggest mistake of life was not cheating on my wife, stealing $1500 dollars from a cash register or shooting someone at point blank range, it was buying this album.So, if there are any smart people out there, you'll listen to things like Barbra Streisand or Bette Midler."
1,R.I.P,Iam a Korn fan so dam anyone whos gona say im another nu metal bashar. I love korn but man they have fallen fast. From Take A look in the mirror to the best off and now they are doing a COVER ALBUM!!!!!! boy does this sound famliar Metallica anyone!?JD called Fred Durst as sell out man take a look in the mirror!1 - Take A look in the mirror2 - Best of3 - Cover AlbumThats 3 strikes your out!K.O.R.NR.I.P
2,Well...,"This album is true to it's name, it is a list of their greatest hits. It is not, however, anywhere close to being a list of their greatest songs.If you are a casual/passive fan looking for a solid collection of good Korn tracks do yourself a favor. Go borrow the album ""Issues"" from a friend and listen to it. If you make it all the way to the end without gouging your eyes out and using them to plug your ears, then chances are you will like this album and will consider it a solid collection of good music.If you find yourself eyeless however, unplug your ears and go buy the self-titled album and/or ""Life is Peachy"", hell even ""Follow the Leader"". That's where Korn's good songs are all hiding.0 out of 367,887 people found this review helpful."
4,"borrowed, then bought...","I took this CD out from a local library. I liked it well enough to buy my own copy. There are several songs I like on it. I also have Korn's Issues CD. I prefer unedited CDs, so they are as the artist intended."
4,Cut it out already!!,"(...)Sorry i just had to get that out. onto the album itself: while this is not their best album out, it's a cd that contains their singles and live favorites and not necessarily their heavier material that Korn fans love. this cd is for someone who wants to get a taste of what korn is like, but id really recommend buying follow the leader for beginners of this band"
2,"Where is ""Thoughtless?""","How can you have a Korn greatest hits album without their best song: ""Thoughtless."" It certainly should have beaten out an unimaginative retread of an overplayed (and overrated) Pink Floyd song."
2,Censored,"I really wish I would have looked more closely before buying this. Why are all the songs on the greatest hits album censored? For a band that swears as much in their music as Korn does, the many gaps of silence in songs really ruins it for me."
3,all censored,"This is the Disney version of korn, good for introducing kids...but for fans just get your favorite songs one at a time, or just buy a the actual cd that isn't censored"
3,"Good, not great","They pale by comparison against Faith No More or Linkin Park. Still, this album does grow in you with repeated listening."
4,Great band but Limp Bizkit is better,"Korn is a great band but they will never compare to the talent that Limp Bizkit has. Korn is a great band and Fred owes alot to Korn and Korn owes alot to Fred. My favorite tracks are ""Got the Life"" , ""Blind"", and ""Freak on a Leash"". Ive been a long time fan. Since 1994, and all i have to say is that Korn gets better every album. Their riffs are crunchy. The vocals are awesome and the bass is great. They are a good band, but will never compare to the Legendary Limp Bizkit."
3,missing many of korn's greatest songs,"Chi, Blame, Kill You, Dead, Dirty, It's On!, none of those are on here, and they're my favorites. they included too much from the new albums and not enough from the old. I suppose if you love the weird spin Korn's put on itself as of late and don't mind the lack of classic Korn, you'll like it. you either know the songs or you don't. as for those new to Korn, it's not recommended. get the old albums and enjoy them, more than you can with this."
1,Yesteryears trend still somehow has fans???,"It's remarkable how the trendy bands no more than 3 or 4 years ago have lost their publicity. Why? Simply because the 13 and 14 year olds who listened to them at the time are now grown up and either went on to listen to good bands or more trendy mtv metal. For all of you who has bought this album, I feel bad for you. If your buying this expecting a good ""metal"" album, you have no idea what metal is.I'd go recommened some great bands to listen to but why?? Lets keep the good bands underground and the posers popular."
5,Loved It,"I love this CD. I've been a Korn fan for awhile, and have been waiting for a greatest hits album to be released. I love every single song on here, EXCEPT FOR the Freak On A Leash remix. You cannot tell me that that remix is a more popular song than a song like Thoughtless, which deserved to be on there 100%. Having said that, this is an excellent album, and hopefully they will be making more hits in years to come. The CD is well worth the money, so go out and buy it."
3,Just okay,"Korn has had their occasional hit here and there. While this is probably the best Korn has to offer, it's just okay music (in my opinion, of course). The cover of ""Word Up"" is nothing short of genius, but I wasn't impressed with Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick In The Wall"". Floyd is one of those bands that are too sacred to turn into nu metal."
3,What's with all the non-korn fans reviewing this album?,"Seriously, do people have nothing better to do than bash korn because they don't like them? So what...no korn fan cares what any of you think. If you don't like korn then you have no business ""reviewing"" their greatest hits cd. Get a life.Anyway, as far as the cd, it's nowhere near being a true greatest hits cd. There's way too much of their newer music on it. It is a decent cd though, so I give it 3/5."
4,The cream of Korn.,"There's not really much to say about ""Greatest Hits"" besides the good and bad points, so here goes. Overall it's a great collection by the leaders of the ""nu-metal"" genre, but why do we need tracks like ""Trash"" and the ""Freak On A Leash"" remix, when songs like ""It's On"" and ""Thoughtless"" are missing? Also, I hate when bands call a collection ""Volume 1"", just call it ""Greatest Hits"". But I do love that this includes 19 tracks, the majority of the good stuff is here, and the two new songs are cool, especially ""Word Up"". The DVD is also a nice bonus, even though I'd much rather have a disc of videos. Basically it's a great ""Hits"" album for any level of fan."
1,Korn sucks,"Korn has to be the worst band on the face of the planet. Everyone says they invented new metal. Even if that's true, that means that Korn invented the worst genre ever. And yes, that means worse than rap. In their greatest hits pamphlet, they said they got rid of cheesy rock cliches like solos and power chords. What idiots, solos are what show talent. Korn probably just didn't do any solos because they lack what Metallica and Led Zeppelin have: talent. Also, everybody says that Korn's seven string guitars are innovative, but what's the point of having seven strings if you only play three of them. Also, I agree with another reviewer who said that Korn sounds like a special ed kid yelling over a car crash."
1,AWFUL,"Tuned down, ghetto metal from possibly the worst hard rock/metal band of all time. Korn's lack of talent is unbelievable. A complete embarrassment to real metal pioneers like Black Sabbath and Judas Priest."
1,greatest hits for a soon to die band,"I listen Korn albums till follow the leader, I was a teen entering a new style of music, after it I realize that all the songs were just angry teen lyrics and got bored fast, I enter the REAL METAL, not this possers any more and realize that I was wasting my time and money with this called ""Nu metal"", now I made my first review because I hate how they waste ""another brick in the wall"", always the formula for a great hit is: put our 5 best songs (if they are really 5...), some others to fill the album and always add a cover from a well known band."
1,is my hearing aid in right?,"what is this that am i hearing as i play this ""geatest hits voulme 1"" by a well known ""nu-metal"" band called korn because to me it's just bass-slapping playground noise..it's horrendousto say the less and i really thought i like korn when i heard their singles on keerang i was wrong this band sucks and why put out a greatest hits when clearing you're not breaking up..as they've got a new album released soon which i will be first in line to buy and parade around the streets boasting that i have the new korn album..god i can't wait to see the looks on peoples faces when i smash it to tiny pieces and give korn my hard earned cash for ten seconds of pleasure oh well that's what music is about exploiting the fans with ""greatest hits"" when clearly they're breaking up to clearly get more money god these guys are leechesi hate em...god..about would cry"
5,Good Place To Start,"Now let me be clear, I have not bought the cd and probably wont. That doesn't mean I don't support KoRn in what they do but I already have all their cd's. The first track is the only one I havent heard. That said, this is one of the best cd's to start with for beginners. I only wish they would have put Faget and Daddy on this cd, two of their greatest. To the reviewer saying that groups like Priest, Anthrax and the like are posers, you are stupid. Those are the groups that paved the way for Korn and the like after them. Without them, you would not have this cd. Anyways, although I don't have this cd, its a great start for the next generation of KoRn Kids."
2,Stopped being great a long time ago.,"Korn were a laugh and great at the start, and outrageous.They are not a band to be taken seriously, well half and half really.There first two albums were great ""the self titled one"" and ""Life is peachy"" but since then they've just become a product of over promotion from T shirts and are not relevant anymore, they have'nt put out a good record since ""Life is peachy"" and now are more well known for there boring cover such as ""Word Up"" and songs such as ""Part of me"" and ""Got the life"", and they're not heavy metal tunes.Don't even think about purchasing ""Untoucables"" and ""Take a look in the mirror"" - absolute crap.They used to be good but now they've burned out nicely, and in bad way too."
4,NOT QUITE THE GREATEST...BUT CLOSE,"THIS IS NOT A BAD OVERVIEW OF 10 YEARS OF KORN, BUT IF YOUR A LONG TIME FAN LIKE MYSELF, THEN YOU COULD BE DISAPPOINTED. OF ALL THE SONGS TO COVER FROM THE 80'S WHY THESE??? THEY DID A GREAT JOB WITH ""ONE"" BY METALLICA, SO WHY NOT SAY... DO ""FADE TO BLACK""? AND INSTEAD OF SONGS THAT WEREN'T SINGLES LIKE ""TRASH"", ""THOUGHTLESS"" WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. AND WHY NOT A SOUNDTRACK SONG INSTEAD OF A DUMB REMIX OF A SONG ALREADY ON THE CD LIKE ""PROUD""? THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT CD, BUT I'LL GIVE THEM 4 STARS BECAUSE IT'S KORN AND YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THAT. PEACE."
1,Theyre on their way out...,"This album is pretty much everything youd expect. ""Got The Life"", ""Freak On A Leash"", ""Blind"", etc. all of Korns songs that have been on the radio or on MTV, with a couple of unreleased songs thrown in. In my opinion its fairly obvious this is a money making ploy, considering that Take A Look In The Mirror flopped, and nu-metal itself is a sinking ship. The two new songs are awful, honestly. ""Word Up"" is definitely a new direction for the band, but is that really a good thing? It was awful in the first place as a techno song so making it into an equally pathetic genre; nu-metal, doesnt help it much. I would also like to say that Korn butchered ""Another Brick In The Wall"". This is a very weak collection but luckily, we wont have to put up with this much longer."
4,The pro's out weigh the con's.,"Now when say an almost complete cd, it isn't a stab at Korn, hell, I love Korn. I just didn't agree with some of the tracks that they deemed ""the greatest"". For instance, i liked the single shoots and ladders, but seriosly, i don't think it was Greatest Hits worthy. the only reason it was on there was because it was one of their first ever videos. They were showing respect for it. Also, how in the world can you have twist but no chi? Those 2 songs are jigsaw puzzle pieces; meant to be put together. It doesn't make any sense.But, in the end, the cons are out weighed by the con's. Three new tracks(word up, another brick in the wall, and a remix to freak on a leash)and a bonus cd with videos will put out any doubts about this hard-hitting compilation of greatest hits. Korn fans: this is a must have. Do you hear me: A MUST HAVE!."
4,"Korn - Greatest Hits, Vol. 1","Pretty good. I always thought that Korn had some pretty good songs here and there. And most of them that I liked are on this album. Good stuff. If you only like there popular songs, or ones everyone knows of, this is the album to get from them, cause they are all on there. Korn gots a good rock style, pretty unique. Especially the singer, he gets pretty crazy sometimes. I like about half or a little more than half the tracks on this album. Check it out! All the classics are on here.My Top 5 Songs1.Here To Stay2.Somebody Someone3.Make Me Bad4.Freak On A Leash5.Blind"
3,Miss represented,The title of this said it had a DVD to go with it. I did not recieve the said DVD. I sent the first order back and they sent a replacement. It too did not have it. The CD is great but if you offer a DVD it should be there!!!
1,Korn Sucks,Korn Used To Be One Of My Favorite Bands Until They Made That Weak Cover Of Another Brick In The Wall. If I Could Spit In All Of Their Faces I Would For Ruining A Great Song. If You Want To Rock Listen To Pink Floyd Or Led Zeppelin.
1,R.I.P KORN,Another day. Another album from kornit seems killing the name KORN with t.a.l.i.t.m was not anoth for John DHe had to dig it from its grave and squeeze out every last cent so he could buy anoth mansion or something.and with a COVER!!!!??[...]?! :(album coming out. I really do hope that was just a BAD DREAM. for the sake of the name korn and all it stands for.PLEASE JOHN WE BEG U STOP!STOP! trying to relive korns glory days (selling 5 million copies)STOP! pretending u have a bad life u r a millionarie and have a wifeSTOP! writting washed up version of ur orignal songs (T.a.l.i.t.m face it it sucks and was soooo bad it only sold 1 million copies ahahhahahaha what a joke)[...]
4,"Greatest Hits are Great, but...","They left off ""Thoughtless."" I don't understand that. However, saying that...""Word Up!"" When released, got on my nerves. I have been a lifelong KoRn fan and wasn't happy with that song...BUT...It grew on me.It's an average song that KoRn turns good. I LOVE their version of Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick in the Wall.""They actually put one of my fav KoRn songs on it in place of ""Thoughtless,"" that being the song ""Trash."" (Now if they had stuck my fav KoRn song ""Lies"" on it, itd be perfect)...But, I give this cd a 4 of 5 rating purely on the abscence of some songs...They could have turned this into a 25 - track cd.They should have added ""Thoughtless,"" ""Lies,"" ""Let's Get this Party Started,"" ""It's On,"" and ""B.B.K.""But, yes, I still reccomend you buy the cd."
2,Disappointing,"First of all, I really like Korn, I have been a fan for a long time and they are very talented in what they do.Now, 'Greatest Hits'. How can this cd be be the greatest hits of 5 albums in 10 years when it hardly has any of their great songs?! 'Word up' and 'Here to stay' are the exception, but the rest of the content just doesnt make up for the title nor a good compilation.Most 'greatest hits/best of' cds are good choice for listeners who are getting into the band or doesn't own any or all of their cds. I wouldn't recommend this cd to any new Korn fans. This cd is just a waste of money for 'great' *sarcasm* music. You like them? Buy all of their cds, especially 'Untouchables' which is a must own. If you are new to Korn then buy Marilyn Manson's 'Lest we forget' which is what I consider a 'greatest hits' cd."
5,Dark-X reveiws (Korn's 2004 album - Greatest Hits),"This album has Korn's past hits, a song remix,two new songs, and has a DVD which is good so far. This album deserves my 5 star rating. Korn fans will NOT be disapointed. You shouldn't liste to the ratings of non-Korn fans because if you are a fan, your opinion of the album may be different. Worthy of the money and the best album I ever purchased.Look for other music reveiws from Dark-X"
3,The Bolivian Experience,This book is a boring but good book that gives enough details to write reports for young students and it is a greaat way to learn more about a South American Country
4,"Comprehensive, Practical, and Easy to Read","Living Yoga is a wonderful read. I am glad I found this book. I have been searching for an overview of Yoga for quite some time now. I practice Yoga regularly, but wanted to know more about the background, history, and all encompassing lifestyle that is Yoga. I am excited that this book offers so many resources- at the end of every chapter... every passage really... there are recommended books and organizations, if you want to find out more. I actually have a running list now of Yoga books I'd like to get. I am thoroughly enjoying everything about this book."
1,You should always read reviews,The other review is totally accurate when it says that most of these are NOT original recordings..This CD is a waste of money...I should have read the review before I bought it...lesson learned...!!
3,Calluses,"I was hoping this book would be as good at the passing of the techno-mages had been, but it wasn't. It didn't have the same drive or passion that the other books had. The ending was a letdown primarily because we know how it ends, and nothing new or dramatic was offered at the end. In the techno-mage series we see a fantastic ending that encompasses the series as well and that is what I had hoped for here.I'm also very picky about redundancy in books. This one talks about the calluses on the hands of some of the characters to the point of being silly, and was very distracting.Overall it is ok, nothing special, but not terrible either."
2,save your money,"Since the outcome is known, not much in plot surprises. But what's disappointing is that there's not much revelations on the characters neither."
3,"Not a great story, but good background information.","This Babylon % novel tries to pull you into the plot but falls short. I've read better Babylon 5 novels, but it does a good job in exploring the background of the Shadows and other information that the series does not cover. Babylon 5 always reminded me of the Galactic Affairs novel, The Falin Crisis. I loved the series because of the same complex universe it creates, and if you like this sort of story, then the Shadow Within should appeal to you."
4,What Really Happened on Khazad Dum?,"For those Babylon 5 fans who would like the whole story on what went on at Khazad Dum, when Sheridan's wife and her archeological team woke up the sleeping Shadows, this is the book for them.It fills in the details of an important incident in the storyline alluded to, but not fleshed out, in the TV series.For those who also wondered where the creepy Morgan character comes from, who ends up pulling Londo and all of Centauri Prime into the Dark Side, this book will satisfy your curiosity.Definitely not a ""side story""; this is intrinsic to much that follows."
3,"Good story, unexciting prose","As I liked this book and the story, I couldn't past how the prose seemed written at a 3rd grade level. I almost felt insulted by how simple the book read. Besides that it was a good book."
4,"the sad, heroic fate of Anna Sheridan","The novel does a nice job filling in details of John Sheridan's former wife, explorer/archeologist Anna, and her perilous encounters with Shadow technology, on Earth and with the IPX Icarus team on the remote planet ""Alpha Omega 3"" (better known as the Shadow homeworld, ""Z'ha'dum""). Cavelos manages a somewhat sympathetic portrayal of Anna's colleague Morden, as another tragic victim of the menacing Shadows. Less interesting is the concurrent story of Sheridan himself as captain of the space destroyer, Agamemnon. Cavelos handles the military culture aspects well, but the terrain is far more familiar SciFi space fare. Hard to compete with the allure and mystery of the enigmatic Shadows and their treacherous homeworld."
5,Zen In English Literature and Oriental Classics,"RH Blyth is refreshing delight. Quoting English German French and Italin poets as well as Chinese and Japanese, his clarity as to what is 'Zen' is brilliant.There is incsiveness directness and a resonance which rings true, illuminating that which cannot be described in words but is available as we read his selections and critique.As this copy was published in 1942 the contents pre-date that. The poetry and prose is classical-references are to the Bible,Shakespeare,Keats,Milton,Dante,Blake et. al."
3,"good design, weak bulb",The compact design and portability of this overhead is excellent. I move it around every week and I love how quickly and easily it folds up. What you sacrifice is brightness. I wish the bulb were stronger.
2,3M 2000AG ... fail,"Purchased the 3M 2000AG overhead projector and was pleased with its performance and ease of use until the fourth time I used it. The plastic Focus Mechanism Assembly component deformed and crumbled into pieces despite that I limited use to short intervals to avoid extreme heating. Being a teacher and avid user of various display technologies, I know the significance of being cautious with projectors. So unhappy!!!"
2,Not what I was looking for,"I was surprised by it's small thickness and color-book like quality in terms of the actual paper pages. I rated it low mostly because I think there are much better values out there. If you want spine assessment, try David Magee or Dutton."
5,Among the list of great movies.,"One of the great classics! Glenn Ford & Henry Morgan give an outstanding comedic performance! Marlon Brandon is superb! I want to see this wonderful film on DVD, so I can keep it forever! A must see!"
5,A fun movie,"The Teahouse Of The August Moon (DVD) Marlon Brando, Glenn FordGlenn Ford and Marlon Brando at their best, in a fun movie with an underlining of early, post war prejudise against the Japanese. The picture quality is great with very good original sound. The only negative comment I have is, this release is in Letter Box format. Even with my Wide Screen TV there is a lot of top and bottom black, unused space."
3,Teahouse of the August Moon,Cute humor but a little slow paced for me. Glenn Ford did a good job. Brando's character was somewhat annoying. Maybe that was their intention. Eddie Albert did a fine job.
4,A classic comedy of misdirection,The kind of humor is much like that in the English comedies where the butleractually runs things: here Marlon Brandon plays a very clever Japanese interpretor who makes his American employers look classically dumb.In this movie is also the confusion in postwar American minds of the Japanese Geishaentertainers with prostitutes. In Japan the Geisha were sort of like minor movie stars and were even more rare in the farming backwater of Okinawa.An enterprise in which the local home brew becomes a thriving industry to supply the American occupation's thirst is classically misunderstood by the command's ideas of the democratic plan for the conquered.They were just lucky there was no Islamic terrorists on the side?A fun time is had by all and everybody ends happy.
4,The Teahouse of the August Moon,"Teahouse is an exceptionally good comedy, especially looking at all the horrible tripe put out the last 20 years as ""comedy"". Marlon Brando is a scream in this movie and you are hooked in the first 30 seconds. Unfortunately, the VHS version is a P & S version and the movie suffers greatly. But there is an alternative! The widescreen version is 'available'. Turner Classic Movies shows this movie about twice a year in the letterbox format."
5,Fabulous Film,"We just spent 4 years in Okinawa and it is a paradise on earth. The people are what make the island a great place to be. This film presents the wonderful aspects of the island and is hilarious in showing how the US Army tries to run the island after the war and the travails of one Capt. who tries to build what the Okinawans actually want. The author of the book (which is also excellent, and is different enough from the movie to warrant its purchase) was stationed on Okinawa and the story reflects an awareness of the island and the actions of the Army. This is a great movie that can be watched over and over. The movie is especially relevant given what is going on currently in Iraq - it makes you wonder if there will be similar stories from our building up of Iraq."
5,The Teahouse Of The August Moon,Glenn Ford and Marlon Brando were so great in this movie. It took place in 1940's Japan. Glenn Ford was in the Army stationed in Japan and was sent to another town to build a school but ended up building a Tea House. I didn't remember what was going to happen because it was so many years since I had seen the movie. It was funny through the whole thing and would recommend it to anyone that loves Glenn Ford or Marlon Brando.
4,Hilarious,Glenn Ford's whacky portrayal of a misfit captain and Marlon Brando as the Okinawan interpreter present a hilarious satire of U.S. occupation following WWII.
3,Timing comes up short.,"The video indicates approximate time of 60 minutes. Conservatively speaking, there is about 35 minutes of original video on this DVD. Even given the extra and backstage scenes, it falls far short of 60 minutes. Also, there is a gratuitous tequila advertisement at the beginning....I was unaware of the need to mix the advertising model with the pay-for-service model."
3,Good but not great,"Sara Jean is among the most spectacular women ever to appear in Playboy. This video doesn't do her justice! I would also add that I have owned perhaps 40 or more Playboy videos over the years and I doubt if I could be so unlucky to have so many technical problems with those products. The productions are fabulous but the quality of the media in terms of clarity and stability are I'm sorry to say, about a 3 or 4 on a scale of 10! Why cut cost there? I just don't get it!"
2,Depressing and Tiresome,"The socialist or perhaps Marxist viewpoint is expressed by the kids' teacher early enough to confirm what one already suspects: there's not going to be much light anywhere in this tunnel. Realist cinema of this nature was groundbreaking in the mid-20th century. This contemporary film's writer and director seem to expect audiences to be shocked by the characters' adoption of supposedly American ghetto slang and behavior. Or to be less than wearied by the petty, territorial machinations that are supposedly as close as these characters will come to any real sort of power. The only silver lining comes with the implication that art at least provides an outlet or even hope. But even this is pretty much smashed. So - shall we all buy guns and just end it now? I wish I'd turned the thing off instead of basing my expectations on the good reviews on the film's box - apparently another example of reviewers positively rating a film for its message rather than for any true artistic merit."
3,TRACK LIST,Track Listing1. Hear Me Now (Listen to Me Later)2. Me Myself & I3. Brother Man4. I Am What I Am5. Wrongful Snagulation6. Without Direction7. Cripple8. Scoey's Place9. Nothin' Ta Do (And All Day Ta Do It in)
2,"product OK, but shipping is a disaster","The staples are normal, but the box was blown apart by the poor job of packing this for shipping. I now am picking small bits of staples and loading them into my gun instead of a single clip. Buy these at your hardware store!"
2,RnB ja mmmm ..... next,I suppose if you a fan this DVD would just be too awsome NOT to have in your collection but unfortunately Mr. Legend does NOT do it for me. A brilliant artist but not the line of music that interest me. I find his voice to be very monotonous and barely half way throught the show i started yawning.Unfortunely he will NOT get the vote from me though but for all the RnB lovers out there be sure NOT to miss out on this one.Corinne Bailey Rae what a beautiful voice .... be sure to watch out for some thrilling music from her in years to come....
4,Good item for the price,"This sleeping bag has good fill and easy to wash in a washing machine. It also has straps to bind it up when not in use. A good sleeping bag for stay overs, camping or just for emergencies.Good deal for the price."
4,quality sleeping bag,We wanted a quality sleeping bag for our son for sleepovers. He has had it 4 weeks now and has used it a number of times. It is comfortable and warm. straps work great and makes it easy to put away in the closet. I will be buying another Wenzel Higland when my youngest son is ready for sleepovers. Great sleeping bag!
3,Not,"The Bandai Jitter Ring is a much better product than the Gyro-ring Pro Edition.The Gyro-ring has much larger, cheap-looking washers and a large (5 mm long) dent where the ring is welded together. The Jitter Ring has really nice beveled washers and you can't even see where the seam is. I wouldn't care how the washers looked if they spun the same, but they don't. The spin of the Jitter Ring feels more stable and true, making it a lot better for tricks."
1,Poorly built,The main ring in this brand is thinner near the weld than the rest of the ring and therefore it does not spin correctly... sending back and purchasing a jitter ring
2,Not the product that I originally ordered,This product wasn't the original product that I had ordered. In a sense it was like or maybe is false advertising.
2,"Does protect the ipod, however...","I have owned these ""ipod skins"" for about a month. The thin rubber that covers the ipod screen tends to create bubbles between the rubber and the ipod. This makes it very difficult to view the screen. To prevent this, I tried to force all the bubbles out by pushing them to the edges of the screen. The bubbles always came back. So, I began to stretch the rubber so that it would hover over the ipod. This worked until the thin rubber got worn, and broke. Also, the rubber used to protect the rest of the ipod attracts foreign material, and gets full of it when you put the ipod in your pocket. A positive aspect of this jacket is that it does allow you easy access to the ipod, and all its features. Also, as advertised, the jacket does fit the ipod like a glove. However, this makes it quit a hassle if you wish to take the ipod out."
3,Twist of the Wrist,"This video was informative; but it was very dated. Circa early 1980s. I have subsequently taken a couple training courses which cover newer material and techniques. Not negating the TotW video; but buyers should be informed that the video is dated. It also lacks clarity and focus on a couple points in that the dramatization and attempts at ""humor"" obscure the technical points they are making.It is precisely what you should expect out of a 1980's motorcycle superbike training school that appears to have self produced a video for the first time.I paid ~$24 with shipping and think the video is worth about half that price."
1,Sucks!,"First of all, it's old, so the of course it's going to be cheesy. I was willing to look past that. But most of the DVD shows guys drawing how they're going to enter a turn and to pick out certain points in the road... they repeat it over.. and over....and over... and over.. I had to stop the DVD before I even made it half way through. I finally decided to start watching it again the next day.. and guess what?.. more drawing! I have learned more watching videos on YouTube than I did from this video - nothing."
2,Time to update...,"I love the series of books but this DVD falls down. The material and footage is dated. The shots do not nearly go far enough to take advantage of really letting us see what is being discussed. When this was shot that was probably due to equipment limitations. It is really, realllly time to update this with much more extended and closer footage. This medium could be the icing on the cake for the series but it's really more the box you throw away to get to the books..."
1,don't waste your money,"This dvd is terrible. I bought it in the hopes that it would be presented differently than his books, but it is just the same. Keith uses ten-cent euphmisms like ""products"" and ""points of timing"" and whatnot, when all he is talking about is negotiating a turn. Pick your braking point, your turn in, and go. Simple. Faster the better.Keith has a promising career in middle management ahead of him.Also, the ""humorous"" bits and the pauses between them account for WAY too much of this vid."
3,Good for your first year of riding,"This video is old and dated, but the basic information is timeless. So if you can get past the 80's garb, you will learn. If you have been riding for over a year, my I highly recommend ""Twist of the Wrist II"" video not the book. I've been riding for 14 years and I watch the ""Cornering Bible"" before every track day. I still learn from it."
5,A Very Worthy follow-up,"I was going to write a review, but the first reviewer covered that ground more than capably. I find the cover of ""Mas Que Nada"" out of place, but the sampler very much has the strength and energy of Volume One of this series, and both volumes should be considered extremely strong samplers overall - very sexy, very energetic, exceptionally recorded. Okay, in one track in Volume Two, the female wordless vocalist is kind of weak and probably ought to have been either mixed down, or vocally processed, or both. Hildegard Knef returns with a great track that has almost a smart, beatnick poetry feel. Max Greger doesn't appear here but some of his finest fellow travelers, such as Fredy Brock, do. Both In-Kraut volumes definitely survive repeat listenings, and can fire up any party crowd not jaded against music that doesn't REEK. Marina Records: You guys RULE!"
5,Really Good!,"Well I can't give the perfectly written review. But I can so that this was a very good book.It was written for husbands but it doesn't mean only husband can read it. I think it is great for anyone 16+ because it is definitely an adult book.This book actually gave me some help as being a brother. I suggest that people read this book. Even if they have a strong marrage or family, for that matter."
3,Summer in New Zealand,"Back Cover description: Jacinta knew as soon as Paul McAlpine opened his front door that she shouldn't stay. Gerard had warned her not to fall for Paul, his cousin, during her visit to Waitapu, New Zealand. But she already had-ten months ago! She'd kept her distance then, determined not to give into the compelling attraction she'd felt for this man. Now she faced spending a long, hot summer in Paul's company. How on earth was she going to deny their mutual, sizzling desire?Not a bad tale, but filled with misunderstandings that get annoying. Paul thinks Jacinta is involved with Gerard, and Jacinta is clueless as to what he thinks. It was OK, just not great."
4,orgy of addntoxus,"i'm obviously incapable of giving this above a four, but most people have missed the point. this is a good few minutes of sex on synth.highlight? orgy of bubastus. i DEFY you to listen to that and not crack a smile, even if you're not going to laugh like a loon and play air synth..."
4,daleks with moogs,"Where to start? This album is brilliant and alien. Add N to (X) has a clearly developed style, borrowing from Can, Kraftwerk, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Wall of Voodoo, Holger Czukay, Wendy Carlos, the Residents, and Portishead.The opening track, ""We Are Add N to X"", is an absolutely wonderful introduction to the band. Most of the other 12 tracks fit together as a movie score written by Daleks -- at times edgy and slightly menacing, but mostly wonderfully, absurdly weird. ""The Black Regent"" is one of the few duds; it's confined and doesn't go anywhere interesting. ""King Wasp"" is infectious.Highly recommended for Electronica/Ambient fans.--Pat / zippy at cs.brandeis.edu"
2,this is the scoop,"this is their weakest record. Avant Hard is MUCH better. I've been doing electronic music since these people were in kindergarten, and I know good programming when I hear it - this ain't it.HOWEVER: Avant Hard is Well Worth The Effort. I would recommend you give this one a skip and get Avant Hard."
4,Old but handy,"I bought this book for my father who knows absolutely zero about cars because we had given him an old Fiat Spider. We'd had it restored, but these old cars really need a lot of TLC. This is a great beginners' book on the subject. Lots of diagrams and practical hands-on ways to perform maintenance on your own classic vehicle."
3,"Bulky, uses up a USB port, etc.","It's the only answer to an older Cinema Display and a newer Mac. Unfortunately, it's expensive, bulky, requires use of one of my precious USB ports and yet another electric outlet. Also, when my Mac goes to sleep, neither USB port on the rear of my 23"" Cinema Display works. AND, because I have a ""white-light Cinema Display"" (i.e. the power button has a white glowing light behind it rather than a green glowing light), the button will no longer work as a power-on button. It just sort of pulses white light when you touch it. So there's that. Still, I'm able to use my ""old"" (c. 2004) display with a new Intel-based Mac Mini, which means a lot to these old eyes. btw, you might think you can get one of the other ""DVI to ADC"" cables that come up with a search here - but take close look at the male and female ends - as far as I can tell they're really ADC to DVI, i.e., for a newer DVI display to an older ADC Mac."
3,It Works,"This adapter definitely works but it is so frustrating that I had to buy it in the first place, why isn't there a less expensive way to connect my mac laptop to my mac monitor? It is also extremely large, just a warning."
2,Seems to be working ....,"I'm not really a computer person. When I tried attaching the cord to my mac mini 50% of the internal prongs were bent out of shape. I paid a lot for this item and the seller didn't mention anything about this within the description of the condition. Needless to say I was disappointed. I was hesitant to straighten them because I was afraid of causing more damage. It plugged in after the prongs were straightened and it seems to be working. Although it takes longer for the monitor to light up, then it did with the older cord I used before. Is this normal? I don't know. I feel like I overpaid considering the condition. I'm not sure I would use this seller again. This is the first time I've had this experience with a product purchased through Amazon."
2,Another comedy series off to a bad start,I bought the first season but only viewed the first two episodes. One and two were so boring and unfunny that I have yet to get back to view the rest of the episodes that I bought. In the first two the dialog sounds like improv performed by comedians who are all having a bad day at the same time. If a line isn't witty the first time it's delivered it certainly won't improve with repetition.
4,Humorous,Very realistic and the characters are hilarious. Amazingly realistic and soooo funny at times. It's nice to watch something that isn't depressing for a change.
5,Beast of a glue!!!,"I will forever use 3M products! Dried super fast and it's adhesive power is beyond exceptional.Needed this glue specifically to glue a canvas convertible top to the rear window which had become unglued! :-(Love this glue, it saved my life!"
3,"This is not a 12 pack, only 1","For the price and how long it took to arrive i would have spent the extra few bucks and went the the store. The first tube I got was a dud and blew out the back completely ruining my caulk gun and making a huge mess. Once I got the new tube and a new caulk gun i was able to finish injecting torque mounts for my 09 Si. Have yet to install them but they look great. They sent me a new tube for free which was nice of them. They def need to update the item title though.... NOT a ""Pack of 12""."
1,Too Viscous,Nearly impossible to use. Needs a pneumatic caulking gun or the strength of HULK!! I returned this because I could not use get it out of the tube.
3,Diana and the Royal family,This video is an historical video of the royal family and the footage is more of previous British royals then of Diana. There is alot of footage of the royal family from the early part of the century. There is very little Diana footage. Diana is mostly still photos. This a is a video about the family Diana married into and the narrator compares Diana to Grace Kelly and other great royal figures. Excellent footage of the royal family through out the century and very historical but very little of Diana.
2,You've already seen most of it and possibly better done,"A lot of the footage is something you've already gotten in some other tape if you collect Diana videos, I've even seen a lot of the old B/W newsreel footage used in the historical comparisons. There is just a little video I'm not familiar with and a few still shots but htis program doesn't amount to much. Some of the video is very grainy and more than one of the photos appear to be very badly copied from some book, magazine or newspaper. Buy it if you're desparate to have EVERYTHING, largely a waste of time otherwise."
4,Feasted On: Underfoot by Leanne Banks,"4 out of 5 stars!! The chemistry between Walker & Trina is palpable, I just couldn't get enough of this pair!! =0)Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and two teasers on my blog)"
3,trouble with thickness and wheel studs,"The spacers are well made. However, be certain that your original wheel studs are long enough to accomodate the thickness of the spacers. I could only get about 4 turns with the lug nuts.Thats not enough thread for my liking.I ended up spending another 60 dollars to get spacers cut thinner to get a few more turns on the lug nuts. The description advertises that you can use your existing wheel studs. Well, I could not feel safe with only 4 turns making contact. My machine is a Kawasaki 300 Bayou,maybe other Quads have longer studs and will be fine.By the way, I could not find longer wheel studs from any where (auto parts stores and atv dealers)even the internet."
2,GOT IT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT.......BUT.........,"I must admit I was not very pleased with this book........I enjoy doing compatibilty reports for friends & family and have found another method much more reliable..Composite charts, at least for me, do NOT reflect what's really going on between two people in a relationship - of any kind...It creates a 'third' chart of the relationship itself that, as I said, does not, at least to me, to reflect the people's planets, etc.If anyone can help me better understand this theory, I'm open to learning more about it!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Completely Unintelligible,"I found this book to be completely useless and utterly confounding. The instructions given in the book read like a mathematical problem on an exam. Hand says that this book is the only one you'll need to cast a composite chart, but he doesn't tell you how to figure out the latitude and longitude of your houses or planets within the charts.If you're a novice to astrology, steer clear of this book. I was hoping to make a composite chart for my boyfriend for our anniversary using this book, but I am completely confused and terribly disappointed."
5,Planets in Composite: Analyzing Human Relationships,"I have found his observations on composite charts to be extremely helpful and enlightening. Regardless of the current verdict on whether or not composites ""work"", I can attest to their validity in determing the theme or feeling of a relationship, from experience. This book is a valuable resource in helping to understand the energy at play when two people interact. I highly recommend it."
3,Much of this info is available Free online,"I was a bit dissappointed to find that most of the information given regarding the composite planets in houses, and aspects I have already found for free on a certain website. Word for word! I had expectations of deeper meanings and explainations, I'm glad I bought a used copy. Considering it was written in 1975, this is basic cookbook style astrology, without much emphasis on soul growth or the ""why"" we get into certain relationships. Not completly unworthy of checking out though."
4,So far it's been fun,"Great expansion, like the updated rules, love the pieces, just seems overpriced for what it is.My son and I have only played a few of the scenarios but it's been cool so far. I like how they figure out the nuances of each theatre and represent those simply in their expansions. Like with Eastern Front Expansion they give you the Commisar and with the Pacific Theatre Expansion there are tweaks to accomodate for the Japanese soldiers training and influences. They also give you history around it, so for me.. .this becomes great learning opportunities for my kids (and myself) especially when you see it affect a battle.My only wish is that the expansion price reflected what you get... but hey, I still pay it :-) and it's getting good raiting, so I guess you could argue it's worth it."
1,Expensive Disappointment,I have owned many Panasonic cordless phones so I didn't blink when I forked over $400 for this 4 line beauty.You need to know 3 things about this phone.1 My customers tell me my voice fades in and out from the corded base.2 The range on the hand set varies from acceptable to pathetic from the same location.3 The hand set stopped functioning after 13 months.
1,AVOID THIS SYSTEM AT ALL COSTS,"We bought this system when it was released. It beeps on your line when a phone call comes in on another line and steps on your conversation having you to ask the person on the other end of line to repeat what they said. After finally being fed up with this design flaw I called for tech support. The unit has been updated to overcome this issue, but they won't update the software for you. Also, if you use this system in a business (who won't?) you have to send yours in first and wait 7-10 days. Phone support is horrid."
1,What a poor system,"PANKXTG4500B Phone System, 5.8GHz, 4-Line, w/ CID, Expandable, BlackPeople can't hear me when I am on cordless extension.On hold music sounds horrbible when you record your outgoing digital production.Very complicated to forward calls to autoanswer for a front desk person.Panasonic technical service is very bad, and uneducated."
4,Good for small business,"This phone system is good for small business. But they're the consummer product line so dont expect many features as the professional line. I don't why some people in this post gave it a bad review. If you want to have 3 digits extension instead of 1 digit to impress your customer, all you have to do is tell your customer that your ext. is 230 for expl. As soon they press the key number 2, the system will transfer the call to that ""fake"" ext. 230, the system ignores all other numbers after the first key is pressed. I normally don't write review. Amazon.com shipped my order fast and I did have a very good experience with them in the past."
1,Volume Problem - Callers can't hear me.,"Unless you like to hear ""We must have a bad connection, I can barely hear you"", don't buy this system. The problem is worse from the handsets, and there is no adjustment.I send the whole system in for repair, and the replacements do the exact same thing. FYI, this is not a problem with my line - any other phone works fine.I regret spending so much on a bad product."
4,Quality telephone system,"I've had the system about a month and thus far the service has been exceptional.I use it in my insurance agency and am using 5 handsets.The system is quite feature-rich,was relatively simple to install and easy to learn to operate.The sound quality is very good-including the speakerphone feature."
5,Works with Wifi intensive location,"We had growing trouble with the panasonic 4000 series because of interference with wifi and the microwave oven. We have not had this happen at all because they changed the frequency. We have little 5.8GHz traffic at the moment, so this may change as that band fills up."
3,What I can't hear you.,"Spent all this money on this phone and the volume is very low when you are on it. I purchased two additional handsets and two headsets for my business. When you are speaking on the phone, customers complain that you are talking to low and that they cannot hear you.I like all the features on the phone but hate the reception and the fact that I have to talk loudly for someone to hear me. Would not buy another one. I called Panasonic and they basically told me that I would have to pay to get another phone. Wow. Amazon may have lost a customer to a local retailer."
1,Good while it lasted,"Fine product, works as designed...Died after 26 months - April 2007 - June 2009 RIPTragically short lifespan. Symptoms, phone lights would flash and one could not receive calls. Resetting phone periodically worked for a few weeks, and one day, sob, it could not be revived!"
4,Panasonic 4 line phone,Just received the phone. Delivery was as expected. The phone does seem to accomplish what we wanted to do which was have the ability for my assistant to transfer a call after she answers the phone to voice mailbox for me. There are a lot of other usful features so far we are very pleased with the phone system.
1,Don't Buy-or suffer my fate,"I'm a fool and I've purchased two of these in less than 2 years because I did not want to go through the setup of a new phone system. Well that's what I'm doing now.My second Panasonic system has the same exact nothing screen and will not reset, it's dead and so is the Pansonic home brand in my mind.Please don't buy this phone, I'll update when I find my replacement."
3,Not worth the price,I am writing this review after using the system for almost 2 years. My verdict is that you will find a better deal for your money elsewhere. The entire two years I have struggled with the bad noise quality and had to constantly switch the callers to my second line which uses a different phone system. I love using speakerphones when I talk but it was an absolute pain using the speakerphone on this system. It does have a lot of features that you will find in many pricier systems - but what is the use of that when voice quality (the most important feature) is so bad?
3,"hands free speakers quality, and ring tones","i bought this item through Amazon in may last year, and when I received it I found out that the base is really big in size to the limit that I did not expect, but I said it's ok, i can deal with this and then poor limited ring tones I thought, Ok I still can live with this, but the real spec that is still bothering me and I feel it is a MANUFACTURING problem is the CORDLESS handsetS HANDS FREE feature and how bad the MICROPHONE becomeS to catch my voice and transmit it to the other lineeverytime I turn the hands free feature on, the other person on the line ask me to scream to hear my voice because it becomes unclear anymore and distortedwhich is weired, coz I had another panasonic that I used to use its hands free feature as well and I had No problem at all with itrather than this it is OK phone to buy, though expensive"
1,Panasonic 5.8 Ghz 4-line FHSS,"Amazon, Thank you for allowing a ""truthful"" review! I can not honestly provide a review, because theItem being reviewed:Panasonic 5.8 Ghz 4-Line FHSS Expandable Cordless Phone System with Call Waiting Caller Id and Answering System (KX-TG4500B -- has not worked in my office environment from - the day I unpacked it. OK, that does Not mean it's a bad product in an open environment! I already know that my building is a tough situation for wireless devices; i.e. concrete walls and lot's of steel structure; but I expected the 5.8 Ghz signal to travel better than it does?! Plus, I have been trying to find a ""signal repeater"" (added expense) to mount throughout my facility, which would ""relay"" the phone signal, and Panasonic does NOT offer this device, and no other electronic supplier that I can find makes this ""repeater"". So, my opinion has to be, No Good! because of the lack of product support from Panasonic."
2,"Sad to say, the sound is not good","Bought the KX-TGA4500 system to replace my 10-year old KX-TGA4000 system. I really liked the TGA4000 and the setup/features on the TGA4500 were very similar and I was pleased .... until I made a call.The sound volume, on both ends of the call, is far too low; and the party on the other end of the call complains of the sound being ""Muffled.""I called Panasonic and the tech took me through all the standard troubleshooting, but in the end, resolved the volume is just poor.I returned the Panasonic KX-TGA4500 and bought an AT&T; SB67138 system and really like it. Cost was comparable.Hard to believe that Panasonic has been selling this system for a few years now and haven't addressed this issue. I did get the tech from Panasonic to admit that complaints about volume are commonplace for the KX-TGA4500."
4,A Good Small Office Telephone,"This is the original and still the best solution for multi-line phone service in small offices. Avoid expensive phone systems and the wiring that goes with them. It couldn't be much simpler than Panasonic's 4-line phone answering system. 1 to 4 phone lines plug into the base unit and all the remote handsets (up to 8) only require an outlet and NO phone jack. Phones wherever you need them. I live in a rural area - 5.8 Ghz means I can walk to our mailbox out on the road and continue my conversation.There are better, more robust solutions, but if you factor in the cost of equipment and installation, you would be hard pressed to justify other phone systems."
3,Panasonic Telephone,This system is not very user friendly. We have trouble understanding the manual and getting the phone set up to work correctly. I have worked with computers for the last 20 years so I know a little bit about electronics but this system is very technical but the features are very few. When you transfer a call to an extension it does not automatically go to voicemail if not answered it will just ring and ring. You actually have to transfer calls into a general voicemail box and the caller has to navigate to the correct voicemail box on their own. It is functional but not very user friendly!
3,Very low volume,"The prodct has been very reliable except for the fact the volume, even at the highest setting, is still so low, most people complain they can't hear me and to speak up. This is the same on ALL 4 of the handsets I have, so it is not a defect in one. A phone is not much good if people can't hear what you say. It is also difficult to hear them and a headset only makes it worse."
1,Junk,"I bought his system about six months ago and I've had to replace it already. During the time I had it, it operated average at best. The sound quality is terrible. I found I had to yell for people to hear me speak. It has nice features but it the basics don't work all the features don't mean anything.Pass this by."
2,Not worth the price,I spent the extra money because I wanted the office style handset with a portable to carry when I moved about the office.Always had battery problems. Not the quality I would have expected from Panasonic.
2,bad equipment,I had this phone for less than 2 years and one day the dial tone just went dead. The manufacturer said that it would cost more to fix it than to replace it. I'm totally unimpressed with this over priced phone.
2,A very disappointed Shirley Temple fan...,"I was born in the mid-seventies and have always enjoyed watching the classic Shirley Temple movies. When I saw this collection I thought it would be a great way to introduce Miss Temple to my daughter while also watching some of the fun stories she's familiar with acted out. I was very wrong.First of all, Shirley Temple is in her mid-thirties and only narrates the stories. There are some pieces where she does play a small part but the show mostly focuses on other child actors and guest stars such as Jonathan Winters, Agnes Moorehead, etc. It was like watching cheap plays done at an elementary school. The acting and writing are very poor and the production and set quality are also poor.There is a reason this TV show was cancelled after only one season. My daughter lost interest after only three mintues and I did after five. I am giving this away to our local library."
1,Not a good buy!,These dvds were not at all what I had thought I bought. They really are kids stories being played out by amitures. Not very well done or recorded either.
3,Not what I thought it was.,"Due to the picture on the front cover, a young Shirley Temple, I thought these DVDs would be of her younger years; however, they are not. These DVDs are when she was in her early teens/young adult years. They should not advertise these DVDs with her younger picture as it is misleading. Now I have to buy another set of DVDs to see her in her younger years!"
3,not what you think it is,"These are movies narrated by the ADULT Shirley with her 3 kids. All are very primitive movies.My 2yr. old grandchild did like one of the movies, the ""whinnie the pooh"" one. It is done like a theatrical play, as all of them are. I feel they should not have put the photo of the young Shirley on the cover. It is missleading.It should say; Shirley Temple Black!"
2,Poor Everything,"This telvison makes me angry everytime I use it! It has a poor picture - sometimes movies are so dark you just cannot see what is happening, everytime I watch a movie I have to adjust the brightness, and the same thing for television. The sound is horrible too - I ened up getting a surround sound system just so I could hear TV, and I have the same problems with movies too! I got this as a gift - if I would of purchased it I would of returned the darn thing right away!On the good side this televisions has lots of input ports for people who own like 4 video game systems, and whatever else! The have a port on the front, which does come in handy for viewing pictures from my digital camera, or camcorder."
4,a lot of good material,"I think this is a good SAS book to have, in particularI really like the scope of it. The authors have puttogether a pretty wide range of the most important, coretopics: report writing, debugging, a lot of datamanipulation, including array processing, a littleSQL, and other essentials (stats, macros, and graphare not discussed, mainly base SAS).Though I am a fan of books that focus on new codingtricks and such, I appreciate how this one reviews thesystem processing for each step, besides showingexamples. For instance, WHERE vs IF statementprocessing is compared, SQL vs the Data Step, etc. Understandingthis is necessary to become efficient and creative in SAS programming.Some minor issues including some typos, and I agreeit's a bit pricey, but overall a good, informative book"
4,Good SAS resource,"This book contains a lot of important SAS features and functions that are a helpful resource to SAS programmers. The authors use many good, clear examples demonstrating the features they discuss. The chapter comparing data step SET and MERGE statements with PROC SQL is very helpful. Also, the data manipulation and SAS reporting tools chapters provide many useful features in summary form."
2,There are several better books.,"The primay problem with this book is that, between pages with good examples, it has pages with compact rules without examples.Instead of paying the outrageous price of this book, you want to buy THE LITTELE SAS BOOK, SAS PROGRAMMING BY EXAMPLE, or SAS FUNCTIONS BY EXAMPLE. They are overpriced too but they have better examples."
2,Not good,"This book is described as an intermediate to advanced book, but I didn't find this to be true. This book is more for the beginner to intermediate SAS user, but it is a poorly organized and watered down version of other SAS books. There is nothing novel about this book at all. I don't get why it's so expensive either. I am returning mine to the publisher."
1,Kindle version is flawed. End notes don't have workable links.,The content of this book is good and looks very promising however I have to return the Kindle version for a refund. This book has tons of end notes but none of them have workable links. I have to manually flip back and forth between the main content and the end notes. Very annoying for an ebook.I will notify Amazon for the problem and I will either delete or edit this review once Amazon reposted the eBook with workable links for the end notes.
1,Es realmente triste,"La calidad es pésima, no corresponde a lo que en algun año ya bastante pasado fué Angelica Hartman.Es una barbaridad, pero en fin, no es lo mismo Los tres mosqueteros que Veinte años después."
3,"Broad, shallow treatment","Hough crams 21 admirals into these 260 pages. There are plenty of pictures, and Hough consumes space to describe the political and strategic situations that defined or constrained an admiral's action.Therefore, there remains a rather minimal text budget for the admirals themselves. This book is therefore at an appropriate level for someone generally interested in history, but naval history buffs will come away disappointed."
4,Earthquakes,"Showed film to my 4th grade class for Science - they really were interested and it kept most of their attention. Some parts were a bit technical, and would have really liked more actualvidoe of the earth moving (real or via computer video), but would recommend."
3,Decent Earthquake Documentary,"I'm an earth science teacher and I purchased this movie as part of my unit on earthquakes. It was good, but the kids were bored by it because it didn't have much earthquake footage, it was more interviews with scientists. But it was very educational, and it's about an hour long."
5,top notch,this is an uncommon design and i love iti do not think it would be good for very very quick usagehowever if you are good on a steel it is second to none to have both fine and coarse on the same steel
3,Griz,"Classic Mexican Horror movie. Its got witches, man-eating dogs and a IGOR like servant. Seriously, this movie is OK. Kind of like one of those old Vincent Price movies. The acting and the special effects of the movie leave much to be desired, but then again for its time I guess it was high tech. For the price not to bad."
3,Okay......,"Maybe this was good for it's time, and it definitely had it's moments, but quite frankly the plot was a little contrived and silly, and the charcters had very little reason to do what they did. They seemed very forced by the plot. I don't want to get into spoilers but there were a few times during the movie I actually laughed at. If you like black and white, I would recommend the haunting, or Carnival of souls over this one."
2,Missed Opportunity,"As the title suggests, From The Ground Up explores the way in which coffee makes the journey from bean on the tree to cup in your hand. This promising topic is unfortunately mishandled by Su Friedrich who manages to craft a documentary which although visually interesting at times, fails to cogently convey a narrative that informs remotely as well as it might. Moreover, the perplexing choice to use one very annoying song played over and over again (mostly in endlessly repeated truncated segments) as the background theme music for the visuals rendered this film unwatchable after a while. Overall, From The Ground Up represents a disappointing exercise in documentary film-making which is probably best avoided."
1,Into the Ground,"This is amateur hour the whole way. One has no idea where the filming takes place until close to the end. The processes of cultivation and brewing are not explained. The ""film maker"" is stuck on one song repeated endlessly throughout. It's a complete mess. It looks as if it was a middle school project done by someone who never picked up a camera in her life. There is nothing educational or interesting about this DVD. Don't waste your money."
5,Perfect,I purchased this book for my niece Leila. Everyone was so excited to see her name and spelled like she's spells it. Wow. It was nice to see a book with a child's name that is a bit more unique. The book itself was also very informative with great photos. Thank you Amazon for having it available.
5,"This album is WAY ,WAY UNDERATED!!!!!","Now true there are a few more catchy song's on the Soul Temptation album.But this album is alot faster with more double bass.So it's really a question of whether or not you like the more melodic power metal or the more Power speed metal approach.To me this group is AMAZING anyway's!And I just can't see how anyone could knock any of their album's.The only minor problem that I had with this album seemed to be corrected more on the next album,and that's the fact that sometimes the lead singer strives to sound like Dave Mustaine,and I think Megadeth fan's would love this aspect,but come on,how many Power metal fan's really listen to Mega Deth to begin with?Probably not that many.That is if there is any..."
3,Iron Maiden with a speed metal twist.,"I love the soaring vocals similar to Iron Maiden with a much faster stronger sound. Great Double Bass work. Terrific songs at the beginning especially ""Metus Mortis"", ""Shadowland"", and Checkmate in Red and I love the opening on ""Into the Never"". They have pretty good use of what seems to be a string section that reminds of Metallica's S&M (good or bad) Songs toward the end seem to lose some energy like ""Behind"" but overall a quality if not innovative metal album. metal blade records had some short samples up ..."
1,Waste of Cash,"It's the most disappointing game I have ever purchased. It's the same price as World Wide Edition, yet far inferior. Pros: Cool graphics, it comes with Thousand Knives, and it's on the P.C.. It COULD have been a good tutotial, but Yu-Gi's far too difficult to beat to make it a great learning tool. Cons: You can only play Yu-Gi, who has the same deck throughout the game. You win one card after each battle, usually a common. It wouldn't uninstall from my computer, either. If you have a Game Boy Advance, get World Wide Edition. If not, then buy both. It's portable, uses less electricity, and comes with FAR better cards (Sinister Serpent and Harpies Feather Duster, for two). If you're unfortunate enough to buy the game, sell the cards on ebay to get your money back."
1,Not as good as Joey the Passion,"I have played both Kaiba, the Revenge and Joey, the Passion, and found that Yugi, the Destiny is a flawed game. You can not change the deck that you are given originally, no matter how many cards you win in the duels."
1,So boring you'd be better off playing yourself in the mirror,"This game is the WORST ever, you just play agains the same person again, and again, and again!! Its so boring you'd be better off playing yourself in the mirror. Trust me just buy a pack"
2,Dont waste your time or money on this.............,"I got the game free with a magazine and it stank!It's just like everyother card based game,and it has more glitches then you can count!I can beat the came in 20 minutes, and its not much fun.Oh yes, and how cold I forget about Yugi constantly apearingon your screen, saying some stupid corney line like""Lets finish this!"" or ""Beleave in the cards..........""And Im acually a Yu-Gi-Oh fan! But I realy sugest you stay away from this boring game!"
3,i wish that the game had more cards and more opponents,the game only has 155 cards that you can have to get new cards you need to win new cards you only start with like 47 cards i have not won all the cards yet i seem to keep getting the same ones at last time i counted i need 16 cards yet to have them alli wish that the game had more cards or that they make add ons that you can get for the game and as for opponents you only playyami-yugi i wish you would have more then just him
4,Best TCG I've played for the PC,"This is a cool game and the tutorial is the best I've seen. The repetitive voice and sayings is a little irritating but the duels are terrific! Started playing 2 days ago and won 2 duels so far..against Yami, that's saying something."
3,"Huge Potential, But Another Yu-Gi-Oh Game Blows It","WWE still holds the crown as the best Yu-Gi game as Konami dissappoints with Power of Chaos.It had huge potential... great graphics, cut-scenes, etc. But every area is a let-down.First, it is a HUGE deal that they don't include ALL the cards. They do in the GBA version why not here?Second, you can only play Yugi... this get lame fast!Third, no multiplayer... this is what the card game is all about. I would forgive # 2 if they had a multiplayer system. You could have had online tournaments and everything.After the absolutely horrible The Sacred Cards came out, I had high hopes that Power of Chaos would stop the quality slide... but it continues the distrubing trend of rushed games and gameplay.Die hard fams will enjoy the game for about 2 days."
2,Could be better,"Not many cards... Quite boring with that kind of ammount. It's like if you draw Mystical Elf it automaticly makes it your life saver. Also not enough traps and field magic cards... Just get Joey the Passion it has 700+ cards and Joey is using diffrent deck strategies like Light Deck, Water and Aqua Deck, Dragon's and much more! Kaiba is ok I guess."
5,On Human Nature,I am a big EOW fan. I got this book at the same time as The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins and have to say that On Human Nature is about a million times better than The Selfish Gene. I've read this time and time again; and he has a literary style like no other. All detailed with supporting facts and grounded in science.
4,A nice balance,"Wilson does a great job of keeping a blance between hard core science and easy to comprehend examples. He also does a nice job of keeping his views positive, without making humans seem superior. This book does a great job of investigating the conflict of nature and nurture and which is responsible for human nature, I highly recommend it if you are looking for an enlightening read."
1,"Boring, incomplete, disorganized: Readers deserve better.","E. O. Wilson is a great biologist. He doesn't know more about human nature than anybody else. A person who has not read an evolutionary account of human nature (of which there are many) may find the subject matter fascinating. However, Wilson's presentation is boring, incomplete, and disorganized. A good editor would have trimmed it to one essay.The tone is condescending throughout to anybody who in not a PhD of hard science, which is unjustified. Evolution is not a difficult concept. Wilson got the Pulitzer for this book, probably because they didn't have the nerve to give it to him for Sociobiology, which would have deserved it. If you want the hard science, go read that. General readers, you will only like this book if you are as ignorant as Wilson thinks you are."
5,Time-Tested Classic,"A must-read for every, well, human! There's little to be added to the thorough comments left by other reviewers. I just wanted to add my 5-star rating to the tally.(Some of the ""intellectuals"" are really tough with the ratings, huh? Looking at the 3-star ratings for this classic work, I can only guess that the reviewers must be Nobel Prize winning social scientists who graciously took the time to pop in on Amazon and leave a review of their poor colleague's acceptable-but-somewhat-pedestrian work.)"
5,Consuming,"This CD did not leave my changer for at least three weeks after I bought it. Plastikman isn't for everyone, but if dark, minimalist techno appeals to you, then Mr. Harwin (a.k.a. Plastikman) is as good as it gets. 'Nuff said."
4,Laid back,"This whole album is nothing but undertones. This album is very quiet (if you listen to it you'll understand). It is not %100 ambient. I wouldn't even know how to describe it because I have heard nothing like it other than his other album, Artifakts(although a little louder). I listen to this when I want some background noise, ie sleeping and working.I hope my brief review didn't sound negative, because I do like this album.(this is the same review that I gave Artifakts)"
3,Evolution?,"Well, I think a better name for Plastikman after this album is Minimalman (hence, the new label, Minus) There's merit to this stripped down sound, and it sounds hauntingly like I'm listening to a party that's far away or subterranean... Alas, the repetitive basslines (two notes, teeter-totering) regardless of how many micro textures and filter sweeps that teem underneath, make this album a rather boring one, or for the die hard fans of the dancing red cartoon figure, 'mantra-esque.' Sorry Richie, but this album's just not dynamic enough, to captivate me for long."
4,A Moving and Compelling Read,"""Hell's Bottom, Colorado"" benefits from sharp, focused writing and real-life details, which make the stories ring true. Though each story stands alone, there is the connectedness of family saga as we are introduced to distinct, evocative members of this modern-day ranch family. A truly pleasant read."
5,The Empire Strikes Back!,"You can always tell if a novel is good if you can envision the locales, the charcters and the action. Continuing the story from A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back is a darker, yet much more exciting translation of the film by Donald F. Glut. From the Ice Planet Hoth, to Luke's training and his confrontation with Darth Vader, this inventive tome is taken further from the overly-descripitive New Hope, and while the book is basically a word-for-word copy of the film it's such an enjoyable adventure that it hardly matters. Is it better than the film itself? Well, no, but to be transfixed by the first couple of pages is a very good sign. Escapism at it's finest."
5,The neverending story continues in The Empire Strikes Back,"The second book of one of the greatest trilogies of all time, was a very good book. I hope I can give my regards to Donald F. Glut. He has truly made the book better then the movie. The book has a lot more detail and thoughts."
2,"Well, ...It's okay","This junior novelization of The Empire Strikes Back was not very good. At least from my standpoint, which I'll admit, is a bit too old for it. The writing is boring and unimaginative, and seems to speak in five word sentences half the time, and it left HUGE chunks out. I plan to read the adult's novelization as soon as possible, and I hope it is better. Kids ten and under might not notice or care one way or another about the flaws in this book, but older fans probably will not like it."
4,This is a nice book,"I thought this was a great adaption of the movie. Now, I looove ""The Empire Strikes Back,""but it is my least favorite Star Wars Movie(That'll tell you how much I love Star Wars!), so I can't give It a ""10."" I read this book in the book ""The Star Wars Trilogy,"" Whicj is all three novels together.If you want an even better novelization of Star Wars, Read ""A New Hope"" and ""Return of the Jedi(My personal favorite)."""
2,I seem to be in the minority here....,"I enjoyed the Empire Strikes Back as a movie, it's probably the best in the entire series, so naturally the story in the novel will be all right. The novelization did an adequate job of following the script; but that's about all it did. Very little emotion or background behind the scenes, like the Phantom Menace novelization. It seemed awfully flat, even in the important scenes. It's definitely readable, but I don't think it's worth five stars."
3,The Story Continues.,"This children's adaptation of the original STAR WARS saga is the second of a three book trilogy. It is supposedly written for an audience of 9-12 year-olds. Nevertheless, the writing could be a lot better; if it weren't for the pictures and few illustrations most kids in the projected age range would be completely bored by the book. Not only that, but this version of the story leaves huge holes in the ""real story's"" plot. Also, there is no picture of the Millenium Falcon escaping the space slug (one of the best scenes in the film), nor or there any pictures of Boba Fett (there is, however, one slight illustration of that great bounty hunter). This book is probably best for the youngest of STAR WARS fans and those who are most fanatical."
5,All the excitement of the movie!,"Being that the Empire Strikes Back is my favourite of the Star Wars movies, I just had to read this book. It won't disappoint Star Wars fans, with all of the energy of the movie. I liked how it wasn't a complete adaption of the movie, with different things taking place on Dagobah. I would recommend this book to any science-fiction or fantasy fan."
4,Great book,"I like this book. Not too fancy but if you're from this area or just interested in it's history, then get it. It had some great pictures, and alot of information that I did not know.Selah and Yakima were my home for 16 years so I'm a little bias.Get this book-It's a great read.Also get the poems book by Dan Peters."
4,Very thought provoking,"This is an excellent book. I'm not particularly fond of reading Asian and Middle East-based fiction, but this made quite an impression on me! Marjan is the main character- a cripple, who has lost her mother and never knew her father. She lives w/ her auntie Chava and her uncle. She manages to wangle her way into the presense of the Queen Shaharazad and her sister. What happnes next is quite good- you'll have to read it for yourself. A very suspenseful fiction book that's well written."
4,Stay with it - it gets better and better,"Initially, this book was hard to follow. Toward the middle, the story was much easier to understand. At the end, the book was very interesting and exciting. I think the author could have done better at the beginning of the book to keep you interested and to keep you reading. I had to read this book for a school project and I may not have continued because the beginning was so boring. I kept reading and really got into the story. So stay with it - the story turns out to be really exciting."
3,Above Average,"This book was okay. It kept my interest most of the time, but I didn't like the ending too much. It was exciting at times, and it was interesting how Shahrazad loved the sultan. Kind of weird though."
5,Wonderful...wonderful,In a sentence...I am telling everyone I know that this book should win the Newbery for 1998!
5,"""An awesome book!!!"" by Cora Hughes","One of the things that I liked about this book was that it took so many turns, you thought you knew what would happen when something else would happen instead. I also liked the adventure mixed with mystery. The book talks about many feminine things, and I would not recommend it to boys. Overall, this book was definitely worth your money and your time. It was really hard to put down no matter where you were in the story."
3,Great cheese!!,"Yes, it is kind of cheesy...yes, the acting ain't great...yes, the special effect are anything but special...and yes, it is about as ""B"" and a ""B"" movie can get. BUT HEY!It is THOR! and you have to pay homage to it. The music is cool, and it is a classic from decades past. I never saw this film till last month, and I thought it was cool. but hey, I already love most all things Thor, so I might be biased. The bonus features are great on the DVD release, and the DVD is top notch compared to some crappy releases. At least rent it...but why waste time, go ahead and buy one."
1,Disappointed,"Where did these high ratings come from. i rented it on its 2star rating, expecting a cheesy, fun B- Movie. This film is so bad i dont even think it can be classified as a B-movie.....more like an F. It drags horribly, fast forwarded through most of it, and the ending really doesnt tie the plot together. Most monsters just kill until everyone is dead at the end but this ending was ridiculously stupid, i wasnt amused."
1,not what I expected,"Ok-sooo I guess it is my fault-however I did not know that ""bleu"" was actually the color BLUE!! I have not used ""bleu"" mascara since I was 12-& even then it did not look good on me! Once I realized that it was actually blue I tried it just for fun (since I had already opened it)-the mascara sucks-it does not lengthen or curve at all!!!"
5,Great for grinding limestone,used this to fit fossils into a limestone slab on our fireplace. Wish I could show you the results-awesome. Used to dry grind the limestone and did not wear out the stone. Would definitely buy again.
3,Life Behind the Facade,"My wife bought this book, autographed by the author, at the Louisiana Book Festival. Reading it took me on a trip behind French Quarter facade that the tourists see--at least to the gay/lesbian subculture, which in the Big Easy is substantial. I liked the flawed nature of hero Chanse McLeod as he grappled with his feelings about his wrestler boyfriend. By the end, I was hoping that things would turn out differently than I somehow knew they would, and did. The gay porno wrestling scene in the first chapter might put some readers off, but it's worth breaking through."
1,Solution Obvious to All But the Dumb Detective,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Greg Herren's BOURBON STREET BLUES and JACKSON SQUARE JAZZ I was really looking forward to this one. It was a colossal disappointment to say the least. Whereas the other two were light and witty and the hero was charming, this book was dark and depressing and the hero was an egoistic, jealous, and above all--STUPID bore. It was obvious from the word go who had abducted his boyfriend. So for nine tenths of the book, in spite of the school of red herrings that were constantly thrown at us, we were left to agonize at his ineptitude. And then there's the ending! Believe me it was all for nothing. Stick with the two books I've mentioned. Forget this irritating trip to nowhere."
4,Great Product,"I love this necklace. It was bigger than I expected. I love the fact it does not have ""made in ---"" on the back of the pendant. The detail of the knot in the middle is not as clear as online and the necklace is big so to wear it as a choker it kind of hard. But all that aside I would recomment this product."
5,Very Nice,"I was very happy with the pendant. It was what I was hoping for...a sturdy, handsome pendant. The detail certainly could have been a little better but for less than $10, it was great. If you're expectations are in the right place, you will be very happy."
5,best for glass top stoves,"This one really works... no smudges or streaks left when you're finished, and it protects the surface. I use this about once a day after I finish cooking to keep my glass stove top looking brand new. It works!"
2,stone top cleaner,This prodect is much too hard to work with. You have to rub so hard to get the streaks out. Would never buy again.
4,Once Soundtrack,"I loved the movie and found the music haunting me afterward. I waited sometime before I ordered the CD, but have been listening to it constantly since. The first 2 tracks leave me refreshed."
5,Amazing Film Amazing Songs,"Once you see the film ""Once"" the music will stay in your head for days. The soundtrack captures the magic of the film and the music is 85% of the story. Wonderful music."
4,Once,"Very real film with excellent music, Glen Hansard has opened up the door to all low budget films."
5,"""Falling Slowly"" The Most beautiful Song Ever Written","This soundtrack not only has the Academy Award nominated song ""Falling Slowly"" on it but there are very few letdowns on this magnificent recording. I am a 56 year-old ""Baby Boomer"", grew up listening to the Stones and the Beatles. This CD blew me away. Besides ""Falling Slowly"" there is the equally impressive ""When Your Mind's Made Up"", ""Lies"", ""Leave"" and ""If you Want Me."" There is not a bad song on the CD! The soundtrack ""Once"" is a great introduction to the music of Glen Hansard and his group The Frames. The deluxe edition of the CD is well worth it as it has two additional songs ""And the Healing Has Begun"" as well as ""Into the Mystic."" It also has a bonus DVD.This is a superb introduction to the Frames music. After listening to this CD over and over go to either your local CD store or to Amazon and get the rest of the Frame's CD's."
4,I love the movie and CD,This CD was an instant favorite for me. i bought the CD before seeing the DVD. Love both.
5,Once,OnceThis CD is FANTASTIC. I haven't been bowled over by pop music in a long time. The emotion that Glen puts into his singing is incredible. His voice does not need to be carried by a lot of technical back-ground stuff like a lot of singers today.
4,Fantastic album,The Once album is great from start to finish. I really recommend this cd to anyone. It's great background music.
4,"If you liked the movie, you'll like the soundtrack too","If you've seen the movie, then you pretty much know exactly what you're getting when you buy the soundtrack. That being said, I love the songs from the movie, the other ones are OK if you're into folk music."
4,See the movie,"First I saw the movie and liked the music so much, I had the CD on my ""Wish List"" for ages before buying it for myself. In my opinion, the tracks are much more meaningful if you have viewed the movie. This is a new artist (to me) and I like his work a lot."
5,Excellent CD-Once,My son introduced me to this movie. I watched it and the songs were playing through my mind so I bought the CD. I love it!
3,IT'S OK,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER. SHE LOVES THE CD. TO ME, IT WAS OK. I DIDN'T SEE THE MOVIE THOUGH."
5,The movie and music a must to experience,This is very soulful exchange between two friends. There is a naturalness apparent in every scene and song. Highly recommended!!!
4,I liked it,most of the songs I love! but there are a few songs that are very short and not the best sounding.
4,authentic is the word,"It's not strange that a song from this album has wan the Oscar for Best Song: although this is not what one would call a ""commercial"" album, it speaks straight to the heart, whether you've seen the movie or not.Authentic lyrics, authentic music without any further effort to impress."
3,Great!!,Does anyone know what song Marketa Irglova sings when she's walking at night after getting the batteries for the cd player?
2,Not my style,"Music has no set style, it is very generic. Perhaps if you saw the movie you would enjoy the CD but otherwise it is very bland."
5,Love it.......................,"I loved the film......very unique just like the CD. I enjoy the artists, the music and the style."
4,Excellent soundtrack that makes the film great,"For those who may not have seen the film Once, I thought it was one of the better dramas released last year. Film that are character and storyline driven always have a place in the heart's of the public, regardless of budget expenditures. Once is a beautiful film whose soundtrack provides beautiful yet hauntingly melodical Irish/Indie alt tunes that continue to stir emotions within me when I listen to them every day. Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova connect creating beautifully put together compilations. Irglova's angelic voice displays a timbre of sadness while Hansard's imaginative guitar melodies and vocal arrangements are ingenious. If you are into a non-manipulative love story that strays from the prototypical American tale, I recommend picking up both the film and the soundtrack."
5,Amazing CD!,"I am absolutely in love with this soundtrack...the music is so captivating and anything from disappointing! Everyone will love this, especially if you enjoyed the movie."
5,Great soundtrack,This is a great CD. I saw the movie and like many others ordered the CD. Marketa Irglova has an incredible voice. I highly recommend this CD.
5,Great soundtrack (& movie),"I have never bought a movie soundtrack after seeing the movie, but this time I bought three! I had never heard of this singer/songwriter, but I think his group has been around for a while-- sorry, can't think of the name! Anyway, love this CD! I'm giving one as a gift; relative got the third and played it constantly. ONCE is a winner!"
5,"Wonderful soundtrack album, hauntingly beautiful songs!","I read about this film and the beautiful music that created the foundation of the plot. I watched the film twice and couldn't get the songs out of my head! I had to buy the soundtrack, and I have really enjoyed the songs, particularly those by Glen. Such talented songwriters, with beautiful harmonies, and so much emotion. If you like folk or singer/songwriter music, you will love this album."
5,A Great Pleasure,"I've seen the movie and fell inlove with it! the songs are so fresh and different, the CD is a real pleasure and is constantly being played in my car. Highly recommended!"
3,"On the whole, a keeper","This CD is at its best when the pair: Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are listed as the co-authors as in ""Falling Slowly"", ""When Your Mind's Made up"", and ""Once"". Glen can be, um, a bit loud if he is of a mind to get emotional, and Marketa apparently tames that beast. The two singer's voices blend together into a remarkable sound.Other than the barely interesting back-of-the-bus ditty, ""...Hoover..."" , the music is great and this is a fine CD for fans of the movie and/or fans of any one or more of the songs here."
5,Love this CD!,"Saw the movie ""Once"" and fell in love with the music.Now I have this CD and can listen to it any time butespecially enjoy listening to it while driving in mycar. : )"
5,Oscar winner !,"A friend of mine told me she thought this movie might just be for 20-something people. Well, I am 50-something and I found it to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. This is a great film with an equally winning soundtrack. No matter what your age you should not hesitate to get this soundtrack along with the DVD."
4,Singers and actors,"Catchy little dittys of love & loss. The best part of the movie are these songs so basically this soundtrack is all the concentrated goodness from the movie. Not to say the movie isn't good too, but y'know...Glen Hansard is a musician before he's an actor right?"
4,Poetic Songs,"A great soundtrack to a very cool movie. Very original songwriting, reminds me of the late great Elliott Smith, or even the melancholy ballads of Leonard Cohen. This indie soundtrack reminds of the music from the recent independent film ""Time and Tide"" directed by Michael Carvaines."
4,"Folky, but good.","I enjoyed the DVD Music much better. Just being able to watch their physical, and emotional input with every song they perfomed was a high for me. I believe I enjoyed the music much more on the DVD than the CD even though the music on the CD was worth the money. I just brlieve they put more heart and soul into their performance on the DVD."
4,mix is a bit jarring,I really loved this movie but found the soundtrack to lack cohesion. The sad songs were interspersed with the more upbeat songs which is jarring and ruins a mood. Love the two singers' voices though. The harmonies are gorgeous. Sad that those two didn't make it together as a couple in real life.
4,Once movie and soundtrack,"Once - Music From the Motion PictureOnceBoth the movie (opening sequence is smashing) and the music are exhilarating. Top notch acting and top notch singing,"
5,90's metal at its best,"I got this album years ago in either 1994 or 95 and it represents all that is metal... The band looks, feels, and plays the part. I recommend this to all you metal heads still livin' the lifestyle because it's nostalgic and makes me happy that people made this kind of music once."
2,Not What I hoped for,The lumbar roll itself was very good but the problem was getting it in place and keeping it in place. I had purchased it for work where I frequently have to get up to attend to some task or other. The elastic meant to hold it in place very quickly twisted and stretched out. This meant every time I sat down I had to adjust the lumbar roll. About all the band did was keep it from falling on the floor.
1,"Don't bother, save your money.","With ten years of reoccurring back problems I have kept old towels and t-shirts in my car(s) for years as I am frequently in need of additional lumbar support. When I learned from my physical therapist that they actually made special rolls that worked much better I was very excited. When I drove up to my mailbox and found the compliance roll with my other mail I couldn't wait to try it out so I stuck it behind me. To my dismay I heard a loud gush of air as the roll went nearly flat. I'm absolutely disappointed with this product. I also ordered Original Roll in standard firmness and it isn't much better. And to answer the burning question, no, I'm not 300 pounds or a big guy in any capacity. I weigh about 170 and neither product does much of anything in terms of lower back support. Stick with the old towels, shirts and pillows. They are cheaper and do a much better job!"
4,Attention!,"Very good movie and undoubtedly one of the best to capture the samurai spirit.Ranks right up there with Kurosawa's classic ""The 7 Samurai"" and in fact could even be a Kurosawa movie.What makes this movie so interesting - besides the outstanding acting -is that this is a newer version of this age old heroic story about loyalty and the samurai code of honour and is here shown from a different angle.There are also a number of other (classic) movies available that tell the same story as this is one of Japans great Samurai tales.One of the best ones is probably ""Chushingura"" from 1962 and is about 207 minutes in length with the always great Toshiro Mifune.So you might want ot try that one too."
4,This is a nice collection of Lasker's games.,"This book is a combination of a biography and game collection. There are 102 games in the book. The games are given in descriptive notation. The annotations were collected. Many of them are from the original book of the tournament that they were played in, however there are alot of games annotated by Reinfeld and Reti. Most of the annotations are light, and there is only one diagram per game. For about 60% of the tournaments that Lasker played in, full results are given. The theory in the book that Lasker played pyschological chess was Reti's theory.The biography side of the book is pretty interesting. For the sake of those who aren't Yiddish speakers, the term 'chammer', which appears in the beginning of the book, really should be 'chammore', and means donkey. For some reason, this is the Yiddish phrase used to insult someone of less than average intelligence."
3,Okay...,I felt really stupid every night listening to this tape. It was not very helpful either. I probably lost 2 pounds but that's not what most people are looking for.
4,The book is a wonderful reminder that friendship is treasure,This book is a treasure to remind a person that the most precious gift is an enduring friendship. It will make a good gift for friends for all occasions. A bedside book to read again and again.
3,Didnt tell me anything I already didnt know,Pretty much standard common sense stuff. What the author should have covered is more details about mortgages and how to figure out whats the best mortgate deal (comparison shopping). But he did not.
5,This deck introduced me to Tarot,"I was instantly attracted to this beautifully drawn deck. I had only seen one other deck and really thought it was quite dull, but when i saw the Sacred Rose Tarot deck I immediately became interested in learning the Tarot. I have not been disappointed after all these years. I have seen other decks but I always come back to this one because it speaks to me. The pictures and art work are striking in a way that makes it much easier to interpret their meaning. A fine work or art."
3,"Muddy, ugly artwork","After reading the reviews posted here and see the card images provided, I just knew I was going to love this deck. Imagine my disappointment to open the deck and see what I can only describe as dull and muddy coloring. As for the artwork itself, the human-noid figures look distorted and ugly, with only the figures in the suite of Cups being at all attractive. Frustrated with the deck, I opened the book and was very glad to find it informative, well written and usable. Hence the stars on this review. If not for the book, I would have given 2 stars."
3,Beautiful Art Work,These tarots are beautiful but are cards I did not connect with so I never use them. But I do pull them out once in awhile because I love to look through them
2,A disappointing deck,I purchased this deck after seeing pictures of it on-line. They looked to be very colorful and a well drawn deck. I was however very disappointed when I actually got the the deck in my hands. They remind me very much of the comic books that my brothers read as kids. The drawings are not at all well done and the colors are rather dark. I really have problems relating to these cards at all. We all have different tastes however and so many may enjoy this deck.
5,A lefty NEEDS this!,"Every lefty knows that the world is right-handed, and life is a constant compromise and struggle. This product makes life a little easier."
1,Low Quality,"This can opener is very hard to use. My Left-handed son was not able to open a can with it. I am ambidextrous, so I gave it a try with no luck either. It was easier to teach him how to use the electric can opener."
4,kitchen tools needed for hurricane times,"Haven't had a hurricane evacuation since we got this, but it will be handy when we do, and the power is off, again. Not sure if I can use a lefty opener, as I've always had to use ones for ""righties"", but I'll sure try."
4,Works great,"Memory works, but my two extra memory expansion slots were broken. Forget about this motherboard problem since I originally put this machine together quite a while ago. Guess I'll have to keep this memory for my next build."
4,efficient,I was looking for this book 30 years. I obtained them finally. the mazón operation seemed efficient and reliable to me
2,Wrong size!,It says 16-1/4 but the product I received is 16-1/2. I can't use it for what I bought.Can't contact the seller through Amazon.
1,Horrible,I don't know what the others reviewing this are using but it is not a good set of tongs. There is no spring so it doesn't open on its own. Never had a set of tongs that doesn't open without spring action. I returned the first set thinking it was defective. Second set was the same. They suck. Not sure who is giving these good reviews but be warned. Tongs need to have spring action to open unless u have some sort of miracle hands.
1,wife,REC'D BBQ TONGS ON 8/27 and the spring snap and broke ON 9/18. NO WAY TO FIX IT AND CAN NOT FIND ANYONE TO TALK TO
3,The Rise and Fall of the Kate Empire (Lizzie McGuire),"Lizzie trys to never get in Kate's way, but when Kate's birthday party goes wrong, Kate is not so cool anymore. With Kate's mom gone, can Kate survive this mess and can Lizzie get Kate to say she needs help? Read the book to find out."
4,Buy this item or not? Maybe this will help!,"I enjoyed this book ammensly, so much I couldn't put it down! The writers did a great job, however it was slightly disappointing because they basically took the script and made it into a book. Yes, in the line of literature judging on sentence structure, vocabulary, and others it was a great book I just wished they would have added a little something more. However, I might have been expecting more then what was obtained from the literature. Bottom line: Buy it or not? I would vote yes with no hestation, because it is a great book after all!"
1,Boring! Dont waste your money!,This book i really didnt care for. There was one part of the book i liked but that was it! It is not worth reading! Listen to me or waste your money on it your choice!
2,Kates big fall,I liked this book a little but it did not really have a point or a climax to it I would give this book 2 stars. This book was about cheerleading. I don't really like cheerleading. If had known the book was about cheerleading I never would have read the book.This book was about a cheerleader named Kate and she broke her arm. Kate got kicked off the cheerleading squad. So Lizzie helped Kate learn how to do stunts with one arm. Kate got back on the squad. She was really glad.This book was very well written and explained thoughout. That's what I liked about it. You would like this book if you like cheerleading.
3,Disappointing,"As homeschooling parents, we're always on the look-out for educational programs for our son. We ordered this title for his 8th birthday, hoping that it would help us to establish a base for him in earth sciences, critical thinking, and foreign languages.The first thing, right off the bat, that screamed out? The use of ""then"" for ""than."" You know, ""It's more rocky THEN the other place?"" I was horrified--who sells EDUCATIONAL software with that sort of glaring grammatical error?Grammar aside, the program is limited. Almost NO accompanying literature for parents, nothing in writing to support the programs/reinforce the information. Activities are, for the most part, amusing, but again, limited; kids aren't going to get a lot of miles out of this."
2,Rose colored rear view,"I'd like to rave about how great the Fariñas were. It would be the hip thing to do. Unfortunately I don't see their recorded output in the same rose-tinted light as most of the reviewers here. Richard's huge ego got in the way of everything they did and poor Mimi, even with her knockout beauty, is a background player throughout. Their ""harmony"" singing is mediocre. Richard's singing is weak at best. His endless noodling on the dulcimer gets tiresome after one track and becomes unbearable. There's a reason the folk boom went bust: this kind of thing is incredibly tedious especially when compared with what someone like Bob Dylan was doing at the same time, same general scene. There's also a reason why ""Reflections in a Golden Wind"" has been readily available in bargain bins--got mine for 50 cents--for 35 years: it's not very good."
3,Find the original,"I received the album ""Memories"" for Christmas in 1968. The recording of ""House Un-American Blues Activity Dream"" (live at the Newport Folk Festival) gave me goosebumps. The album suffered some damage, so I bought the CD set. The CD version in this compilation includes additional Newport recordings BUT the recording of H.U.B.A.D. is not the same performance (the tempo is different) and is of vastly inferior recording quality. To make sure I wasn't imagining that, I played the album and the CD simultaneously, switching back and forth. The CD version sounds terrible. The Newport recordings on the CD are maybe interesting from a historical standpoint, but hard to listen to. If you want R&M's complete works, buy this. If you want the album ""Memories"" (which, by the way, is mostly excellent) try to find the original. For a detailed review of this CD (if your're not familiar with the music) see one of the other reviews."
5,Rocks and Fossils: A Visual Guide (Visual Guides),"I really love this guide, I bought it for my little girl who collects rocks and it help her a lot to learn about this intersting theme.THANK YOU!"
1,Blue Mountain Buckskin,"This is a great book for learning hide tanning tecnique or if you just enjoy reading. Also, it looks great laying on the end table in my hunting room."
4,Well Done!,"I read the reports about a re-recording of the original Testament/Legacy songs, and wondered if it was all true. Low and behold here's the audio proof. While some people may complain that ""Testament hasn't written anything new"" in this CD, well take a look at other band's new stuff…it really sucks!!!! The law of a good metal fan is that the oldest stuff is the best stuff. The new crap never holds the same intensity of the old stuff. The Testament/Legacy members haven't lost a step at all, and all the guitar work is top notch. And plus after seeing the original Legacy members at Thrash of the Titans in August, Steve Souza's appearance is a welcome one on this CD. Totally surprised me. So a job well done to the Testament/Legacy bandmates!"
4,Stunning material,"Well, since I never got acquainted properly with TESTAMENT, I never listened to THE LEGACY and THE NEW ORDER. So, I bought these re-recorded songs without possessing the faintest idead if iot was good or not. The only songs I had ever heard by TESTAMENT were from SOULS OF BLACK, which I own.So, it was a chance buy. And I'm not dissapointed. From the first chords, a wall of sound, great riffing, precise drumming, top of the lungs vocals and great lyrics met me. I'm so impressed I'm going to buy THE GATHERING tomorrow."
1,help these kids.,how can anyone come up with this junk. where are your parents what were you thinking. people like you are what is screwing up are children. get a life get jesus.
1,HO HUM---PUT ME TO SLEEP!!!!!!!!,They put you to sleep within the first 5 min. Intro way too long. I'm hoping to get my money back. Not even worth the $5.00 I paid for it at Walmart.
5,Great movie for kids,"Veggie Tales: Little Drummer Boy was just as fantastic as I had imagined. It has a fun holiday film with a great message. Veggie Tales does a great job of teaching children meaningful lessons in a way that they can understand and enjoy. My favorite feature on this DVD is the Sing-Along Songs. Watching kids sing along, having a good time puts a big smile on my face. Plus, it includes instructions on how to make your own drum which is a great activity for children and parents to do together."
4,good for children,I purchased this as gift for my grandchild as requested by my daughter. My grandchild has several Veggie Tales DVDs. Each Veggie Tale has a lesson to learn.
5,Excellent for young children,I love the way the Veggie tales tell the stories of the bible. My grandkids have a get understanding of the bible because of the DVD they have.
2,Extremely disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was very disappointed in this movie! It was not nearly the quality that Veggie Tales has come to represent. It seemed as if they wanted to put out a movie this year, hurried and copied a story, then put it out to the public. Since there is no ""official"" Little Drummer Boy story (that I could find) I had hoped the producers would come up with something unique, biblical, and of course funny. I was hoping for something along the lines of the parable of the Widow's Mite, giving our heart to Jesus especially at Christmas, etc. This movie is almost word for word, (same characters, same plot, same scenery)as the clay animation story from the late 60's early 70's.Nothing unique there!"
2,Oversized,Would work great if a little lighter. Need one smaller for an easier flip had to use both hands to turn a steak. That hand is reserved for my beer or my drink.
5,Ground Force DVD,"if you were a fan of the show Ground Force on BBCAmerica, you'll LOVE this DVD. I purchased the DVD on Amazon."
2,NOT WHAT I WANTED,"I loved Ground Force when it came on BBC America, so I wanted some episodes, but this is just the highlights-no gardening going on!!!Not what I wanted."
3,ONLY because I Love the GF,If I wasn't such a GF fan I would have given it 2 stars. If all I wanted were clips of before/after shots I would have bought books. The pleasure of this show was the interaction of everyone and the change of the space. It was watching the process not 2 second soundbites.Why can't we have complete episodes!!??
5,Great book!,"I am currently studying under one of many Chitrabhanu's students and this is how I was introduced to his teachings and Jain meditation. I absolutely love this book. It is very practical and can be used by both experienced and new meditation practitioners. There is no extra ""fluffy"" page filling material, just what you need to start meditating. One of the best books on the subject I have ever read."
3,Usable but not the best,"I was hoping to find a replacement for an insulated mug with a wide, flat bottom that Alladin used to make. This was the best replacement I could find. It does not hold heat or cold as well as it should and it is not as stable as I would like. For the price it's passable"
3,savvy deskmate,"I enjoy this product, but it does sweat with cold liquids. It fits in my cup holder and shows the level of the drink. For short term drinks, it keeps them cold and has a nice wide mouth for adding ice cubes. The lid is comfortable to use when drinking."
2,NOT AS PICTURED!,In the second picture it clearly shows that you are able to unzip a compartment and flip it open to access your laptop. This is not the case. You have to pull your laptop out to use it. Other than that the case is fine but that is the main reason I purchased it.
2,Just a way to steal your money,"This album is just a way for corporate interests to steal more of your money by turning the hype about Daisuke into a profit for them. Please, please, don't waste your money on this extremely short, extremely pointless album."
1,some how okay,"Suppose to be okay with with hair, but for some unknown reason did not work this time.I did apply and wait even a little more time that he normal time and after the shower all the root and edges still light brown, complete different to the other part of the head hair. I have the same product from Walmart before and work very good to be the first time and then the second time excellent, but his one that I got from amazon, complete nothing.As I said from some unknown reason this product fail his job, unfortunate we can not return once that I put it on; may was an old merchandise or something similar."
5,good,"deliver so fast!I have not used this so far, but at least it smell good (since free of Ammonia?)much better than the Japan product I used before in which I think stimulating-smell and harmful Ammonia included.The Japan one is gel, this one is liquid, I don't know yet which one is more easy to use. I will try this tomorrow."
2,Just for Men: lots of problems,"I usually use Clairol's Men's Choice but it's becoming hard to find and when I do find, it's very expensive. So I decided to give Just for Men a try since it's much cheaper and easier to find. Well, now I know why it's cheaper. It only lasts 2-3 weeks TOPS as opposed to 5-6 weeks of Men's Choice. Not only that, I use dark brown but Just for Men dark brown makes my hair look more like black than dark brown (leaving it on for 5 minutes as specified). Lastly, every time I shower the towel goes brown when I dry my hair (the wife is not happy about it!). So, if you manage to find Men's Choice, go with it. Even though you'll pay more, the fact that it lasts almost double the period will put you ahead in the end."
4,Good product,"I like this, works good. I tend to leave it in a little less time that recommended, to leave in a hint of grey.Warning, be careful about splashing it. Since it takes a while to change color, you can leave the bathroom thinking you clean up good, and when you come back a few hours later, the clear splashes have darkened and dried and can be tough to remove."
3,"SOUNDS GOOD IN THE GAME, SOUNDS GOOD ON THIS","FIRST OFF, RESIDENT EVIL 4 IS IN MY TOP FIVE FAVORITES LIST. THE GAME IS SO MUCH FUN TO PLAY, AND THE CREEPY LANGUAGE WILL HAVE YOU RESTLESS IN YOUR SLEEP FOR DAYS. AND TO TOP ALL THAT OFF, THIS GAME HAS VERY FRIGHTENING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC. I MUST SAY THAT IT REALLY DOES A GOOD JOB OF LETTING YOU KNOW WHEN AN ENEMY OR ENEMIES ARE NEARBY. BUT, THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF MUSIC THAT I COULD LISTEN TO ANYTIME OF THE DAY. I AM NOT ONE OF THE SELECT FEW THAT FIND ORCHESTRAL MUSIC TO BE A THING TO DANCE TO. I AM INTO THE NEW KIND OF MUSIC, LIKE R/B, HIP HOP, HEAVY METAL, AND HARD ROCK. SO TO TOP THIS REVIEW OFF, THIS IS DEFINATELY FOR WORSHIPPERS OF RESIDENT EVIL 4 ONLY, OR PEOPLE WHO LOVE BEETHOVEN'S GROOVY BEATS. BY THE WAY, IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED RESIDENT EVIL 4 YET, YOU ARE AN IDIOT."
5,Historical account of pre-state Israel,"Shmuel Katz was there. First he was an Israeli newspaper reporter. Then, the personal assistant to pioneering zionist Ze'ev Jabotinsky. Next a leader of the Irgun alongside David Raziel and Menachem Begin. An account of all that went down with Britain's hope of crushing Israel, David Ben-Gurion's traitorous Haganah, what happened at Dir Yassin, the King David hotel bombing. I take great pride in having read this book as a truth seeking Israeli Jew and all others like me should clamor to have this amazing predecessor to Katz' ""Battleground"" republished. It's Israeli history at its best (and worst). Plus, its easy to read. 5 Magens!!"
4,The rise and fall of the Packard Motor Car Company,"In this book, Mr. Scott recounts with resounding clearness the history of the Packard Motor Car Company from its creation in 1899 to its final disappearance in 1959. He spells out the company's successes, and (most importantly) its failures. The book includes many beautiful pictures, and a number of reproductions of documents.On the down side, the author begins the book with an attack on the internal combustion engine, something that seems strikingly out of place in such a book. Secondly, at times the author seems to lose focus, with the final chapters of the book meandering between a defense of his restored 1940 car, reminisces about Packards, and one final attack on fossil fuels. And my final complaint is that this book does not contain even one color photo.Overall, though, this is a very good book. If you are interested in Packards, you should read this book."
4,Great replacement Mirror,"Purchased two of these to replace broken mirrors. Looks just like the original and is easy to install once you figure out how to remove the interior door panel. Just three bolts holding it on and it comes with a new styrofoam gasket. Save the bolt nuts from the old mirror as new ones are not supplied. As someone noted, there is a slight low whistle at certain speeds due to aerodynamics, but its not that bad."
5,Ultra is hot!!,"I have always loved her voice and the music. Not a big house music fan, but she does a bit more by showing she can sing. I saw her at a free gig she did in LA for Virgin mega store (when it was open) she sound great live. My farvorite songs on this set is Feel Love & Lethal Shot. I like her slower more r & B type music, but she holds it down for House music as well. She beend doing it for many years, and she is the master at House music. For anyone wanting to know what a house music Diva sonds like pick this up. Beyonce my try to step into house music, but if you are not true to who you are, it shows...Love Ultra!"
5,Awesome,"Ultra Nate is back and better than ever! I'm lovin' the look, the feel of this album and the positive lyrical vibe she'giving. What else can I say? Good soulful dance club music. She's grown so much. She needs broader exposure in the states."
2,Fair Family Drama,"Better than mediocre, but not exciting or spell-binding as others have made it sound. The book felt more like acts in a play than a continuous storyline. Character development is very good in some, lacking in others. For half the book, I kept having to go back to earlier pages and see who was who; I should have made a family tree to start with. The plot is drama between members of a family, basically each had some deep dark secret that had to be revealed and dealt with. Not a suspense/mystery novel.Spoiler Alert: one of the issues dealt with in detail is homophobia, or rather a family's efforts at coming to grips with homosexuality. Mostly I felt it was handled quite well, but some people may appreciate being warned."
2,Drama after Drama,In every family gathering described in the book drama happens and secrets are revealed. The character development is mostly poor. The emotional and psychological impact the secret or drama has on the rest of the family is dealt with relatively superficial. From my perspective nothing is really dealt with in depth. This together with quite a number of editorial oversights make it feel like the book was written in a rush.
2,Legends Of 3,"the musical content was good ,and the quality.It was like the rest of the sets,that I have. But the problem that I have is that it won't play in DVD players.It only plays on computer. The rest of the sets I have play in dvd players."
5,ENCROSS (WAVEXDIGITAL) SR-M620 IS THE BEST MP3 PLAYER.,"I've had and tried several mp3 players in the past and nothing beats the features that this mp3 player has and at the price. The built-in speaker itself makes this player stand out from the others. When I recieved this player, from jr.com through amazon $119.99, I had to spend a bit of time reading the manual, (...), because of the many features and I just couldn't simply get to all the functions just by playing around with it alone.The good:BUILT-IN SPEAKER!easy mp3 playingLine-in, built-in microphone, direct FM recording to mp3192, 128, 64, 32, 8 bitrates on mp3 direct encodingstandard 1/8th earphone jackplaylistsjoystick like cursor navigation through menusbuilt-in AAA rechargerbunch of surprise featuresit's sliikthe bad(eh not that bad)lacks faster playback speed optiondoesn't come with a jog/armbandno rech.lith.ion battery.If mp3 players had a standard then the SR-M620 should be it.By far the best."
2,Rechargeable battery not sold in US,"One reason I chose this player is because it claims to be rechargeable through USB. But to do so, you need a recahrgeable battery, aaa/r03/um-4, which seems not to be sold in the US. I tried the other type of recahrgeable battery that is sold in US, but didn't work.If I knew this, I would have bought other player from established brand."
2,Disintegrating Pad,"Pad may be replaceable, but it shouldn't need replacement in ninety days, after modest use. Brush it replaced lasted more than a year."
4,Good and Different,"What I liked best about this album were the arrangements and orchestrations of some of my favorite themes. It's also a 2 CD album with 30 themes. A few I have never heard, but most were favorites.Lost In Space, Buck Rogers In The 25th Century, Knight Rider and Seaquest are some of my favorites. Techincally very well done as well. The mixes with the orchestrations are really incredible. And fun!Even the original Star Trek theme has a soprano vocalist that sounds exactly like it did in 1966. Even the Thnderball theme was a great hoot listening to a fairly accurate soloist singing it.This is a collectors album for those who like different versions of their favorite themes and they at 3:00 minutes or more in length. Very cool!"
3,More BSG,I love SoundTracks. It was great to get the sountracks from various Television series. Very reminicing. But I found them Enjoying and very relaxing.
4,Worth the wait!,"Ever since I saw a preview for this game in Nintendo Power, I knew I had to have it. I even e-mailed Agetec, Inc. once to know when it would be released. When I saw [it], I instantly got it. It wasn't exactly as I thought it would be, but it is still a great game. The graphics are very detalied(and cute!), and it involves a good deal of strategy. I'm sure glad I got it!"
4,Good value.,"This is a decent middle of the road gaffers tape. Unlike Permacel, which is a stiffer, denser tape, this tape is more light weight. This often makes handling large lengths difficult. Still, for the price it is decent, thought I don't know that it would have the overall strength of some of the heavier tapes. I'd buy again."
2,Narrower than advertised,"The tape was less than 1.75"", not 2"".But the most annoying aspect of the tape was the weak adhesive. I used to work in A/V. Good gaffers tape is absolutely necessary if you want to do a good job, and want the tape to stick for more than 2 minutes. Good gaffers tape sticks to just about anything, but doesn't take much effort to remove, and doesn't leave residue. This tape actually doesn't leave residue because it doesn't stick.I took a chance on this tape instead of the tape I know is good, but more expensive. The adhesive is so weak on this tape it won't stick to plastic, metal, or even the back of itself. I returned it immediately, and fortunately got a full credit, since it is misrepresented."
5,time for tape,I needed some gaf tape I was out this was least expensive and by a dependable mfg it worked for my need and im pleased
5,Tape!,"This tape is so much cheaper then the stuff they sell at the local camera place, it just makes me wonder...Anyhow, this has all the tack, and durability you want from gaff tape. Don 't hesitate to purchase this!"
1,I does the opposite of what it is supposed to do,"If I pay 3 to 5 times more than regular tape because i don't want sticky residues after removing it I expect it to work as promised.It does exactly the opposite. I tried it on a glossy surface and removed it immediately and all went well. Then, i actually use it on that surface and left it there for several days. When I removed it it left the stickiest glue on the surface and luckily the material allowed the use of warm water and a cloth to patiently remove it. It was much worse than regular duct tape.So now I know that it works as long as you remove it as soon as possible. Not exactly what I needed and paid for."
1,Get what you pay for,"Not sure what tape the other reviewers received, but I won't be buying this again.Bought to supplement my 'usual brand,' for a low budget event, that was going to need a couple of rolls, and maybe could become my preferred supplier and save my clients money.4 rolls purchased - two different colors/kinds of tape received. One was the color and texture that I expected, the other three were more 'cloth like,' than any gaffers tape I've seen or used since I started using gaffers tape in 1983.The four rolls are all different diameters and as promised they didn't leave tape residue. The residue problem is that they don't really stick to anything either."
2,Not the gaffers tape I'm used to,"I just received this in the mail. I've been using gaffers tape for years. With my stash running out it was time to get some new stuff. This tape does do the most important functions of gaffers tape, it does not leave residue and you can tear it by hand. The fabric inside the tape, however, is far weaker than what I'm used to and the tape does not stick as much as I had hoped. Overall, this tape is not of the high quality that I expected from gaffers tape and I certainly do not think it deserves the rating it has gotten from other reviewers. In my experience gaffers tape should outperform ordinary duct tape in all aspects. These aren't the gaffers I was looking for, I'll go about my business and order some elsewhere."
2,Pay more for better quality,"I ended up buying Apollo tape because this stuff...sucks. It barely sticks to surfaces and is really easy to get off the roll, which gaff tape normally isn't. Also, gaff tape normally doesn't come apart if it sticks to itself and this one does. If the adhesive was better, it would be a good deal."
2,Not the g-tape tape I am used to.,"Being a video professional I have used gaffer's tape for over 25 years. This ain't the stuff I used to buy. Its half as thick as the old Permacel tape. Also, and this is the part that really cheeses me off, hidden in the description is that the actual width of the tape is 48mm. Well my ruler says it's more like 45mm or 1 3/4"".In fairness, the adhesive layer seems to perform OK in short term testing. It does stick well and release cleanly, even sticking to itself and releasing. Still, its too thin and too narrow (for 2"" tape).I guess I shouldn't have been so cheap and spent the extra five bucks for a higher quality product. Live and learn."
3,good for the price !,So far it's working like a 40$ 3m i had before ! but again just good for the price you pay!
5,Better than duct tape for all around use!,"I had been given a roll of gaffer's tape and once gone, needed to get more immediately! Duct tape has it's uses, but if not on duct work I recommend gaffer's tape. It is more flexible, easier to handle, greater self-fastening strength (taping to itself), and does not reflect, so virtually unnoticeable. These rolls are plenty big and a great value. Arrived fast and I've been putting it to use daily."
1,This stuff sucks.,This gaffers tape is horrible. I can't get it to stick to any surface for more than 6 hours. I'm dumbfounded as to why it has good reviews. Worst gaffers tape I've ever used. I feel like I got burned on this purchase.
2,forgot that batteries aren't sent ready to use,"I should have realized this, but you can't sent a functional battery (with acid) in the mail, so then it was a pain to get it up and running. Motorcycle shops will have this, but it's a pain and at that point, I might as well have gotten one at the shop."
5,"Great Gloves, Great Price!","These gloves were exactly what I was looking for, some reviews say to small but I take a large normally and so I ordered a large and they were right on. A bit of advice, right when you get them wash them in warm water and let them dry before using made a huge difference."
3,Too Small,"I am a 55 year old man and have worn medium gloves since I was a teen. I didn't think twice about ordering medium this time, but it wasn't even close. Perhaps these were mislabeled, but they were so small I could not get them on even half way. The return process was fairly painless and, other than size, they seemed to be good quality gloves."
3,Nice gloves,"I returned them and bought another type, but they were great quality gloves, just not a fit for my oddsized hands. I went with another Damascus model and they really do make fantastic gloves. I highly suggest them."
1,cheap !,"Cheap material, cheap production, awfully bleed on your hands... honestly, I can't believe that any professional could use these as ""tactical gloves"".doesn't worth the price of shipping."
1,terrible design,"wearing this glove felt like i was wearing a balloon. i thought i'd be safe by ordering a size larger. but this terrible design was both too small and too large. the cuff came up too much and the width was too much and felt baggy. even though it was too large, it was still exteremely restricting and felt thick"
5,"the real deal, and the seller is great","the seller has a really slick deal: you get the gloves in a reversible envelope. If they are the wrong size, you just reverse the envelope, fill out a simple form that comes with it, and drop it back in the mail, all included in the price.They also have the best selection and prices for leather gloves I've seen on line, and you get to buy through amazon.These gloves are the real mcCoy. Cops all over the US use these gloves and it's easy to see why. The short wrist leaves your range of motion completely uninhibited, and the leather is just the right thickness. You can hold a pen, work with a tool, even deal with your wallet while wearing these gloves. They are very well made. They should last me 5-10 years, at least."
3,Driving Gloves tight,The quality of the leather is good. I just found the gloves to be pretty tight on my hands. The thumbs and index finger were tight and the elastic in the gloves was too tight to make the gloves comfortable. I've tried stretching the wrist opening and 'oiling' the leather to make the leather give a little more. I would not purchase another pair because of how uncomfortable they were to wear.
2,Poor quality,"Was expecting soft thin leather but turned out to be a little stiff. also the stitching was VERY poor quality, some fingers were not evenly round or the stitching lines were uneven. Very cheap gloves. On the other hand the seller was SUPERB. VERY fast shipping and includes free return shipping in the event you want to exchange for another pair of gloves (for wrong size or whatever reason) or if you just want to return them. Refund was quick and easy. I'm sure the seller has other higher quality gloves but these weren't it."
2,"not really thin, quite stiff feeling",i got these gloves because of the name (dyna-thin) thinking these are going to be really thin. these turned out to be the thickest leather gloves that i have tried on. they were also quite stiff feeling. would not recommend.
3,3 stars,"They fit nicely, although the quality is disappointing. The gloves were worn only three or four times and the cuff stitching came loose already. They are a little thicker than the wearer had hoped, but they are comfortable."
3,"Poor stitching and dimensions, great qaulity leather.","These would have been great if the stitching was actually finished, and the fingers were proper lengths.The finger stitching on the pair I received wasn't locked and the fingers just peeled open like a banana. Also the middle finger was too short and the ring and pinky fingers were way too long for me.Returned for a refund with no problems."
4,Overwrought With Ambivelence,"I find these gloves to be a good deal for the money. They are snug...perhaps a size bigger would have been better? I wear them around the house, just in case. Initially I was overwrought with ambivelence about them, but duty calls."
1,bad quality,"These gloves were very bad quality..., did not match... looked like they were sewn by a drunk. The Rothco - Black Police Tactical Duty Search Gloves 3450 were much, much better."
4,Use with a Highlighter,"Get out your highlighter because Kreamer's book has some powerful ""keeper"" statements! The one that particularly impressed me was her definition of clutter as unmade decisions. As a decisive person, that statement became my challenge.I read and re-read this book because it is straightforward with immediately useful strategies to simplify your life, home, or office. If you live in any type of physical or emotional clutter and chaos (or know someone who does) get this book!~ Brenda Nixon, parenting speaker/writer/educatorThe Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the Start"
5,Great Advice; Simply Put!,"After reading ""The Power of Simplicity"" along with Patty's other book ""But I Might Need It Someday..."", I have really started to put my life in order. I am more organized and feel more at ease after heeding her advice. The book is an ""easy read"" so you won't spend so much time reading before you can start using her tips. I wanted to share this great advice with others so much that I bought extras to give to friends and family. Thank you Patty!!"
5,A Spectacular Surprise!,"I had never heard of Heather Gevry, but I took a chance based on the book summary and I was not disappointed! Inside These Walls was fantastic. It was one of those books that you start reading and then continue with until you have finished it. The characters were so believable and well described and the storyline so addicting and unpredictable. Man it was SO good! I am passing it on to all my friends! It is definitley a must read!"
4,Great for small business use,"We are a dental office and this printer is our main work horse. Very nice print quality. It takes a few seconds to warm up but once it gets going, it will print pretty fast and quietly. Small and compact size fits well in a small office. We have it now for several months and loves it. I can't report on the longevity of it yet."
1,A dissapointment,The sound on this recording is very poor! The orchestra and singing sound tiny and definitely do not do Handel any justice.
1,needs better directions,"We bought this game and gameboy for our 8 year old. He was fustrated for the first couple of days. The directions for this game don't say now to select a game. (It only says, turn gameboy off, insert game, turn gameboy on.) It says that checkers can be 1 or 2 players, put doesn't tell you how (do you link 2 gameboys together or can the 2 player version be played on a single gameboy?). It doesn't tell you how to double jump in checkers. It doesn't tell you how to play the peg games, just that 1 or 2 peg holes are empty and doesn't say how to move a peg."
1,Baby game,"this game is not fun at all. maybe it is fun for children 6 and down. i think that little animal charicters telling you if you won or lost is very dumb.the 4 types of games are peg,board,paper,and puzzle. if i were you i would save my money and buy a differnt game"
4,A very thorough review of Italian politics since unification,"In this book, I got exactly what I wanted: an understanding of the actors, events, and movements in Italian political history starting with unification in the mid-19th century. Cavour, Mazzini, Garibaldi, Crispi, Giolitti, Mussolini, De Gasperi. The author does a wonderful job of constructing these characters (and others) while conveying the changing political and societal backdrop in which they labored. A lack of tempocentrism and equal emphasis on the earlier periods were very positive in my view. Detailed explanations of the causes, mechanisms, and failures of Mussolini and fascism were especially well done."
2,Anti-Italian Sentiments,"In Modern Italy Denis Mack Smith has fallen into the error of most British historians of Italy. They see the complex and diverse history of the Italian people as a joke and this book is written in that spirit. Smith misses few opportunities to ridicule the Risorgimento and the Italians that were able to throw off 3 centuries of foreign occupation and re-establish the independence of the peninsula that hadn't been seen since the Renaissance that ended with the brutal Sack of Rome in 1527. Smith covers the era in enough detail (the book's sole saving grace), but the air of superiority he assumes and his general attitude toward the era is unfortunate. I don't recommend this book."
5,5 Stars Is Not Enough...,"This is a great CD. So many great songs. Some of my favorites are Suga Duga, Feelin' Myself, Getting By, and Get This Money. Definitely s CD worth buying.Some of the others that I like include Anniversary, Gladiators, and It's Over Pt. IIDefinitely check this one out.Highly recommended."
5,Very well done,"This is a must have for anyone who enjoys Southern Gospel music and the classic songs recorded by Grafted In on this album. The sound is crisp and clear, and the vocals are outstanding. A very worthwhile purchase."
1,Big disappointment,"The music is lovely as is the ballerina, but the construction of the music box itself is shoddy at best. It is very lightweight and within just a short period of time the lid of the music box fell off and the type of metal hinge used is not attached to any part of the lid so once it pops apart it is pretty much a lost cause. And my little girl was always careful when she played with it so if the child is in the least bit rough the music box will probably last even a shorter period of time. The mirrored panels also came off constantly but they at least popped back on easily. All in all it was hugely overpriced, and a waste of money."
1,Useless,"This has to be the stupidest book I have read in a long time. I thought it might be a colorful look into the world of whites who immersed themselves into the black jazz scene in the 1940s and 50s. What I got was Norman Mailer doing some very weird and typically Jewish projecting psychoanalysis of these whites. Everything revolves around sex, tearing down society, criminal behaviour and psychopathology to these people in Mailers mind. While more often than not the white Jazz hipsters were complete misfits or just engaging in misguided rebellion Mailers reflections are so bizarre and perverse its almost humorous. The White Negro is totally uselss mental masterbation."
4,An Engaging Read--Ignore the Cranky Reviewers,"While Captain X certainly has a healthy ego, he's nowhere near the self-absorbed jerk you find described by some of the cranky reviewers here. I found this book totally engrossing from the get go. It maintains a loose, informal tone that is disarming and entertaining. Capt. X and his co-writer not only do a nice job of storytelling, they also effectively explain the ins-and-outs of the industry, taking you behind the scenes and inside the nerve centers of airports and control functions. It's a colorful but credible account, and I don't see why some revieweres here are so totally disparaging. Check it out--you likely won't be disappointed."
2,no pasa nada,"me dió risa cuando syntek mencionó que "" Por volverte a ver "" era una de las pocas baladas de los 80 que no era cursi. Pués escuche este cd y si es cursi su versión de la balada. Cuando los artistas ""fusilan"" o ""queman"" las baladas de los 70 y 80 es porque no hay creatividad y quieren aprovechar que la gente conoce las letras para hacer comercial su cd. No hay creatividad aunque syntek es un buen artista. Como se sentirán Dyango, Sesto, Raphael, Perales, José José etc? R: Preocupados por que maltraten sus canciones."
5,Oldies music,Husbands favorite composers.. He listens to it when we are going here and there in our car. It is great.
1,Too Hickish to be Creed,"The melodies might have a resemblence but it's not Creed by any means. Don't take me wrong, the guys who did this are talented but when you take Creed and say it's a tribute and don't hint what genre this might be, it can be misleading.Acoustic is fine, cuz I personally like a lot of acoustic pieces but the stuff on this cd sounds too much like it belongs on a documentary on cowboys (just listen to My Own Prison) and behind the scene shots of rodeos.It lacked the energy...okay...that's fine...but it wasn't really peaceful to me either. The twang just didn't sit well with me."
1,Hahahah! Funny Funny Funny,"I don't think anyone would actually buy this CD, and your probably just like me, wanting to see how bad people rip on this. Well first of all, there is no singing. Second of all no drums. Third of all It sounds nothing like them. You can kind of pick up the melody, but it's hard to know what song they are doing. This is absolutlely worthless. I might buy this CD if it was, like two dollars. And that's just so I can show all my friends how pathetic this is..."
5,outstanding reference about square-hewn appalachian-style,"After stumbling upon a tattered copy of the earlier version of this book (now out of print) in the local library, I can only say that I called Mcraven several times LD from Germany in 1993 to check on the publish date of the revised edition. Really an excellent book- essential for the shelf of anyone with an interest in the authentic square-hewn type of cabin."
2,very small magnifier,This product was way too expensive and way too small. I sent it back to the company.
2,bad buy,"Too small, barely see the lights. I wanted to return them but with the shipping i would barely get anything back. Not worth it."
2,Lights were dead on arrival,"Opened up the package, plugged them in, and ""nothing...nada...zilch""...they didn't work. The lights themselves were very cute so I was really disappointed that they were dead on arrival. Amazon, however, was very good about working with me to return the lights for a refund even though I had exceeded the 30-day return limit (since I had been out of town)."
3,Cute but little,"From the picture, I thought the ""flipflops"" would be bigger. They are quite small and not to bright. But they were cute."
1,returnnn,too small...the sandals don't look as cute in person. Plus theyre so fragile they will easily wear out in the snow harsh winds rain etc..
2,Looks better in the picture,Very disappointed in the low quality this product turned out to be. It is a gift and I wish I had more time to return it and get something better.
1,Don't even bother,"I purchased this as a silly, jokester kind of stocking stuffer for a beach loving relative and it was too cheap and embarrassing even for that so I returned it. Half the sandals were bashed in and the others had significant creases in them. But aside from that it might have brought 25 cents, maybe, in a Dollar Store. The only thing I can see it as being useful for is as a decoration for a ""Anti Made in China"" party."
3,NOT for outdoor use!,"Darn, I must not have read the fine print somewhere. I bought these for a friend to light up her backyard for parties, etc. but they say ""Not for Outdoor Use"". Disappointing. They're also a bit hokey looking. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Cheap Crap,"Basic light set with small flip-flops that slide over the top of the bulb. Plugged them in and the lights didn't last 12 hours before going dark. Checked connection and bulbs and finally just replaced the light set. Don't waste your money, just not worth it."
3,:/,"I have other party lights and I was so excited to get these lights so I could attach them together for my dorm room so I wouldn't have to have my light on all the time. The shipping took way to long (even though it was free) and the box came all dented up and opened. The lights are cute but they were dented and somewhat broken...I thought about returning them and getting new ones but I know that any cheep lights such as these are going to bend easy, especially in the mail...If you want to buy string lights I would go out and buy them if possible because they are just to delicate to be shipped."
4,Cute for something different,"We bought these for when we go camping. I ordered 2 strings of lights but it was still a little short, so we are going to order 1 more set. Real cute hanging on the camper. Our grandson really likes them."
1,Broke down after 1 year and one month.,"Expensive and disposable. I use this product every other day so its lifespan was really 6 months. When I contacted the seller I got the usual reply ""Sorry, but your warranty just ran out."" Save your money, don't buy this product."
4,Great workout!,"This is a great workout DVD! I exercise regularly (5 - 6/week) and found this to be challenging, but completely customizable. The 10 min segments are perfect - just when you think you can't go on, you are done and move to another target area/body part. I have seen inches come off pretty quickly as well!Would recommend for anyone who really wants to work out and feel it the next day!"
3,Be Careful,"This DVD had such good reviews I decided to give it a whirl. I like it for the most part for toning BUT be careful. Some of the moves can be really hard on your lower back, and neck if you have any weaknesses in those areas. I hurt my lower back doing some of the glute exercises. I still do the DVD but am very careful and don't do anything that starts to feel too uncomfortable."
4,"Excellent workout, but....","This is such a great workout if you do all the exercises correctly and with the timing of the video. I think it gets a little winded at times though. When they talk about stretching, the muscles, breathing, etc, it takes away from time I want to be working out. I usually have the remote next to me so I can fast forward through that part. Other than that, GREAT workout! You'll be sore for sure. It's great that it's divided into 10-minute increments, too."
2,Boring with too much wasted time,"It seems I am in the minority here, but I don't like this video and there are a number of reasons why. The set is dark and uninspiring. There is A LOT of wasted time here. I don't like the voice-over cuing. The thigh and glute segments are effective, but the video is so off-putting I can't bring myself to do them. I felt the arm section was a complete waste of time. Didn't care for the abs either. I tried Pilates Plus and found it to be EVEN WORSE than this one. I don't think either are a good use of time. I would MUCH rather do Squeeze Stronger or Pure Barre for this type of workout. I would NOT recommend this product."
2,This one is going to be a dust collector,"A little background on me first. I do weight training (ie P90X and etc), dance, and yoga. So what I like is pretty varied. I really didnt overly like this video at all. The best pro about this one was the set, which was absolutely beautiful. The second pro was the stretch sequence, it was a pretty good sequence. The rest of it, was very slow and dull. My mind drifted a lot during the DVD. And if you are drifting you are not concentrating on the muscles being used, so it kind of becomes pointless. Also, the narration didnt match the exercises. They would stop moving and then the voiceover would say to stop. This video is not going to be my go to video."
5,Mix and Match for great results,"This is a great method for quick results. I've done a single 10 minute segment, or add additional segments depending on your available time. The Warm Up/Upper Body segment is great, and boy your triceps will be getting your attention for the next few days! I definitely see less ""wing span"" since using this segment. And the Thigh segment - whoa! Nice way to lean out, as I've always had ""power thighs"" and this is strengthing but, not ""bulking"" up an already too large area; Great way to keep your body guessing, and works great on it's own, or by using these segments mixed in with other Cardio, and weight/resistance training!"
3,Eh.......,I really wanted to LOVE this workout. I rented it on VOD.....and thank goodness I RENTED it first before making a full purchase. While the concept and the instructors are excellent. It's clear they are experienced and have something to provide - if you are an advanced exerciser or an athlete looking for something to push you this is NOT it. I was going to buy it to keep it as a lite rest day workout...but it is PACED TOO SLOW. I read that in a few other reviews and did not believe it. They were right. It was not only irritating but it took away from the effect and flow of the workout. Thank you but no thank you.
5,WOW!,"I've been lifting heavy and working large muscles and doing lots of cardio for 6 months. I've lost 45 lbs. When I saw that this uses small weights, I was sceptical. This worked all the supportive smaller muscles as well as the larger ones, I was aching in a good way for two days! I love it. I came back two days later and did more. I can tell that it's going to do more for my quads and glutes than squats and lunges, because the burn is so much more intense. My butt would recover quickly from standard exercises, but for 24 hours my muscles are tight after these workouts. If you're a fitness model, do these before a shoot. Brilliant. The arm exercises are awesome and very challenging. I highly recommend this DVD for body building, you won't get big, but you'll get strong. Combined with cardio, you'll get ripped! I would really like that butt on the cover, can I have it please?"
5,Core Fusion will kick your Butt,"I have takes classes at Exhale and use the dvd for wheN I have no time to go to the gym. I love it.It's split into five 10 minute sections-Upper bodythighs,glutes,core andstretch (and also a the bonus sections).So you can use whatever you feel like or all of them.I do feel as much of a workout as when I go to the studio class.It's a great DVD with precise instruction.I throw in some cardio and I have a complete workout."
2,Not challenging,I was surprised when I got to the stretch portion of the DVD. It was basic with good cueing but not challenging at all. Perhaps if each section was longer and/or there were additional sets it might have been a decent workout. I was annoyed that I wasted 50 minutes of my day and did not get a good workout. The only section that was excellent was the gluteal work. I expected more.
5,Great Workout!!,"I was looking for a workout that wasn't so hard on my knees, joints, etc but still delivered good results. I usually run, do the elliptical, et other workout tapes through the week. These workouts usually leave me sore and I don't look forward to working out. I not only LOOK FORWARD to this workout but also am seeing and feeling great results in only 2 weeks.My husband even commented that he has noticed a difference! I have put all other methods of exercise on hold to see what this workout will do alone and so far I am very impressed! I am 41 and really need something that shapes and sculpts without injury. This workout, so far, is delivering the goods. I want to purchase Pilates Plus and use with this video. I hope I continue to see results in order to leave some of that 'bone jarring' exercise behind.I love this workout and think you will too!!"
4,Great mini core workout for home,"I take the Core fusion class at Exhale spa- unfortunately my schedule does not always allow me to go to a class more than once a week. This is a really great way to get a quick core workout in- its not as great as the actual class, but kind of a ""mini"" version of it. My muscles were hurting and quivering almost as much as during the class.I usually dont like workout dvds but this was very easy to follow."
4,Too tough for my old body,"This seems to be a great video for getting into shape, however, it was a little tough for me. I am 49 years old and I do Pilates on a reformer and other strength exercises regularly, but this one killed my butt. I should give it another try -- going on vacation soon. If I was guaranteed that I could look like the woman on the video, I would definately start using it again."
4,Very good!,"My fiance loves it! She is one of the blessed who doesn't gain weight, so I was looking for something that isn't for ""fat burning"" like most workout videos are. This one is great for strength training. She really feels like it's helping her tone up. However, my only criticism is that the video itself acts as if the workouts are good for men and women alike. I doubt many men would find the workout all that satisfying."
1,Be Careful!,"Granted, I had some VERY slight knee issues when starting this series, but had practiced Pilates for years so I wasn't too concerned. However, after using this video I ended up with a torn meniscus. Buyer beware."
3,left much to be desired,"i did not particularly like the sequences. i thought that they were a bit choppy for my preference. i prefer yoga flow to sculpting, and this didn't really flow at all. it's hard to get into a sequence when there doesn't seem to be a flow. i think if i did get inspired by it and do it regularly then i would have experienced results."
2,Pretty basic,"I like that the workout is broken up into 5 sections, but each section has one basic exercise with a few variations. While it did give me a workout, it wasn't any more interesting or challenging than one I could have created my self by spending a few minutes search the internet for basic toning exercises."
5,Great DVD,You can really feel it working...you will be sore. But it is a very calm work out...not one is yelling at you...peaceful but effective.
2,Boring,"I know that people Looooove this workout, but I just don't. It's the longest-feeling workout dvd I know of. Additionally, the butt on the cover is definitely not the same butt as the person who leads the workout. I realize it rarely is, but this is a total bait and switch."
4,Ouch and Ahhh!,"I am the type of person that might as well open a library with all the workout DVDs I have. This one makes it to the top of the list. There are several selling points:1) time - there are 5 ten minute sections that do not feel like an eternity nor is there time wasted with talk.2) form - these two are very careful about form and ensuring that you are able to visualize exactly how you should be doing what they instruct.3) effectiveness - you feel it afterwards. The next day after doing about three out of the five workouts, I was feeling my muscles.4) palatable - these two are not annoying, don't yell, have nice music (or not) behind them and are all about the work itself."
3,OK,"This is a video that's okay to have in the mix, but the exercises do not target enough different muscle groups to make this workout a part of your core training. They are very isolated to a few movements for each part of the body. It's good for an occasional change, but it wouldn't be the best for your steady, regular core strengthening workout."
4,Scored!!!!!,"I loooooooove it! I'd never done any of the core fusion classes before...really impressed with everything about the workout...simple, (but not easy)and the narration is pleasing to the ear and easy to follow along with! Recommend it!!!"
1,"Horrible, slow, boring DVD","I bought this DVD based on reviews and was very disappointed! I think the title is misleading as it's not a body sculpting DVD, it's more of a stretching DVD with very few toning exercises. The pace was really slow and boring. I could not even make it through the entire DVD. I am going to give it to my Mother who is 71."
4,core fusion body sculpt,"This product seems to be pretty good. I've only done 1 of the 10-minute workouts and it's not a full ten minutes, but I can definitely feel the burn. I've taken core fusion classes at Exhale spas before, and I feel like this video is a good substitute for a one time fee as opposed to paying for a bunch of $15 classes"
5,The most entertaining game I've played in my life,"I've played the vast majority of Paradox games, and many of them are honestly a mixed bag even after all of the patches. While Europa Universalis II eventually became an extraordinary game, the Hearts of Iron series is simply not a good fit with the engine. Victoria, on the other hand, is exactly the ridiculously complex and open-ended strategy game I've been waiting for my whole life.Two notes for consumers not used to Paradox:1. Always get the latest patch before playing2. There is a vast fan community that has constructed sites explaining any question you could possibly have with these games. The best of these are the relatively recent wikis that have been set up (linked from the paradox forums). Read them."
2,"Crashed on me twice, won't play again","The game crashed on me when I hit the spacebar to skip the Paradox Interactive opening credit, not a good sign. Tried to find any patch information on the game on the Paradox Forum site, all patch information leads to Victoria 2, could not find one word on whether my Victoria 1.0 needed a patch at all. Plunging on ahead, I spent 6 minutes happily telling various territories to build factories or expand production, when Victoria experienced an error and crashed.I will be generous and give this game an extra star, as I am uninstalling it before braving another crash. I have no idea if the crash was because I was running XP, or because Victoria 1.0 needed a patch that I couldn't find. A specific link to a game-specific patch webpage would have been helpful. As a final insult, the game requires a complete computer reboot after uninstalling. Thanks!"
4,Good,i was surpised how fast the game came actually very glad about that i have alot of fun with it and i would recommend it too all history buffs but the two bad things is it crashes about every time i play it over a hour and a half and it creates too many saved files and doesnt let you overide them but i still like the game
2,Far less realism than one expects from Paradox,"As other reviewers have remarked, the emphasis here is on economic development, not military conflict. But neither the economic nor the military aspects of this game have anything like the historically realistic details that one finds in Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron. As a result, this feels less like an historical simulation game than a game in which history is caricatured. I lost interest in it quickly."
4,I love strategy games!,"I really liked this game, the interface is easy to use and you get used to it after a few games. I wasn't expecting so many historicla details so I was very pleased. The only downturn is that unless you're UK, USA or France, there's noy much way of winning a scenario."
2,"Like Work, Not Play","I love Paradox' Europa Universalis series, but Victoria requires far too much micromanagement to be fun. The lack of any tutorial or halfway decent manual makes the learning curve far too steep for such a small payoff.Great concept, poor execution. Try Europa Universalis II instead!"
5,EXCELLENT,"I read this book in 1 day and I just couldn't close the book. First chapter just blew me a way, so I had to see what was going to happen. This book has a lot of truth on what infidelity can do to a beautiful marriage and destroy a friendship. But, if you are strong and have beliefs then as you can see you can get through anything.Rhonda hurry up with your next book!"
1,The reviews fooled me....,"I read the reviews for this book and I had to have it. I thought it was going to be a page turner, well I was wrong. This book was horrible. The characters were dull, it was full of pointless information and the ending led to nothing....It really left much to be desired. The only reason I finshed reading it was because I WASTED my money buying it. If you want a long drawn out afternoon, this is the book for you."
1,hair music ...,"most people don't know, but pantera started back in 1980 as a hair band. they didn't get popular until 1989 with coyboys from hell, which even that was a little to hairish for me.i guess what i'm saying is that no one knows about pantera's first 3 albums for a reason: they weren't up to par."
3,Bill Haley Is Great!,"Yes folks there are like 4 Good Songs on this CD BUT th e rest of them sound like someone recorded songs in their basement and were drunk, Just to make a cdThe Joey Welz songs are terrible and make you think why did I spend this $$??? They are done very badly and I will need to take the Good Bill haley songs and make my own cd from thatVery,VERY hard to listen to the whole cd. It is terrible. BUT The haley songs are TOP NOTCH!Very hard haley fans can appreciate the songs BUT the other songs are VERY HORRIBLE!I do not know what was the idea here OUCH!"
3,Good product not stocked,Sure wish I'd known BEFORE ordering that shipping this product would be delayed. This is going to set my project back and that is unacceptable.
5,Great book on how to TEACH the game of basketball,"Coach Jerry Krause is the editor of this book. Coach Krause may not be a household name to basketball fans, but to coaches who are committed to teaching players fundamentals skills correctly, Coach Krause is known as one of the foremost experts on basketball fundamentals AND how to teach them.Coach Krause has assembled teaching drills from some of the best collegiate coaches in the United States and assembled them into one book for coaches who want to learn more about this neglected aspect of teaching the game of basketball.A great resource for coaches who want to make their individual players better by teaching them skills and how to use them to play the great game of basketball.Kevin Sivils - author of Game Strategy and Tactics for BasketballGame Strategies and Tactics for Basketball: Bench Coaching for Success"
3,you've got to wonder about 50% discounts,"The maps may be glorious (although continuing them across a page split is a serious no-no for a putatively ""high-end"" atlas), but the binding is from hunger. I can scarcely believe that the publisher would see fit to package such a heavy-duty work in flimsy cardboard with cheap contact paper fittings. No, I'm not asking for tooled morocco, but pay a little respect to your content by packing it with due professionalism! I expect this to be reduced to flinders in short order--not necessarily requiring terribly much rough handling! I am profoundly disappointed."

5,such a great surprise~~~,"i ve got this cd occasionally. why i picked it up is that it comes from one my favorite japanese band MONO's Human Highway Records. it is a collection of works of 6 groups of the native japanese artists who work on post rock/experimental rock, even something about ambient music. i strongly recommend it to people who likes MONO,GYBE!, EITS, etc. may be it will give you a brand new look about japanese neo-style music."
2,"A VALIANT EFFORT, BUT OVER ALL DISAPPOINTING...","I had anticipated this CD keenly, with Mr. Hvorostovsky away from the tender ministrations of Philips International I had expected his superb musciality to shine. But alas my hopes were dashed by the poor production of this recording. The orchestral sound is produced over the vocals so at times it sounds as if Dmitri Hvorostovsky is running for lead in a race he is destined to lose. What can be heard of his vocals is their usual brilliant quality, lovely tone, and perfect Italian pronunciation and diction. You would swear he hails from Naples, but with the Orchestra so overwhelming it seems a tepid effort at best.I would only recommend this to a die-hard Hvorostovsky lover, of which there are legion, or to completest CD collector, otherwise save your money for his forthcoming efforts."
5,Great CD,This CD is great for instrumentals. It is easy listening. I am a Hawaiian music enthusiast and this one is worth buying.
3,a mixed bag,"I like this album but some of it baffles me.1st the production was mixed by a crackhead, some songs sound better than others and some songs sound like they were recorded in a van. Listen to the first song and then the last song...there is a huge difference. Although this album is good for a few listens, it ends up sounding like a b-sides and rarities. I highly reccommend giving this a listen before you buy, even for hardcore strife fans."
3,had to make some adjustments,"Received this shipment in a fairly timely manner. First thing I noticed is that there were a few gouges on the outside railing - I put that side up against the wall. A few of the slats did not fit perfectly flat - ended up screwing those in. Actually is it was pretty easy to put together. Once I made the adjustments and laid the mattress on it I really had to work it in there to fit - the width was fine, but the length of the side rails were too short by about a 1/2 inch. With some finagling and adjustments I made it work - not the way it should have, but, it works. Beautiful wood, beautiful finish ... just not the perfect fit without adding your own creativity."
3,Bed Frame,"I am reasonably pleased with the product so far although it did show up damaged. The funny thing was, it was not damaged in shipping so I have some concern that the quality control at the manufacturing facility was poor. The product is made of beautiful Oak and there are areas where drilled holes are placed so it can be pieced together by the consumer after receiving. I noticed that there was a significant crack where one of the holes was drilled.If it was inspected before shipment, this flaw would have been noticed.However, the price for the product was very reasonable so sometimes you just get what you pay for. Product positives include: Made in the USA out of sustainably harvested wood which is biodegradable. The product does seem to be durable and I believe the crack, while aesthetically unpleasing to the eye, will not get worse."
4,Good Solid Oak Frame Made in the USA,"I've been sleeping on this simple all wood frame for a year. It doesn't creak or shift much at all compared to the standard steel bed frames made in China. The queen frame could use a center support which is not included but sag is minimal. You might want to get a headboard to go along with this frame. My pillows often sneak off the mattress down the extra 4"" of space created by the end frame and legs. Go for the danish oil finish. Good night."
4,"Simple, Oak, Inexpensive","Looked around for decent bed frames and found alot of junk. Most out there was veneered garbage that will look beaten up in no time. Not only that, I have concerns about the longevity of alot of that Ikea stuff. Who wants that? On the other hand, most of the oak stuff was either too expensive or too ornate/pretentious (at least for my taste).This bed, although not perfect, is great for me. It took about 20 minutes to setup and really looks great in my room. My biggest complaint would be the fact that the mattress doesnt seat deep enough inside of the rails. It basically sits in about a 1/2 inch. Because of this, I can see the slats when I approach my bed.All in all a good buy and I look forward to having this for many years."
2,Not Quite Good Enough From Fox,"Strategy guides have always seemed to have a interesting effect to help people with video games. Nevertheless, third-party companies that make those guides for video games don't actually make them very well at all. For Star Fox Adventures, it has been one of the most surprising video games ever developed for the Nintendo Gamecube. However, the strategy guide Brady Games developed does have a lot of problems. The maps and details are really not detailed enough and quite misleading on certain courses. Another problem is that it doesn't display how to defeat the Star Fox menace, Andross. For so many, they are just better off passing this guide up, for the real deal by Nintendo.Overall: D-"
4,"A good guide, still some missing info though..","I strive to finish a game and THEN buy the guide. This guide has pretty much everything you need to know. One major thing it's missing is strategy for the ""final battle"".I didn't need that much help with this game, but I'm sure this guide could help someone."
3,Not exactly as expected,"Well, you get 14 tracks and this includes a few 'remixes'.I found the cd to be a disappointment in the fact that the songs on here were not like previously heard (and better) versions.na na na sounds washed out and the backgrounds sound really unprofessional. Almost like your kid sister recorded it and layered it over the existing track. I was expecting something like the version I heard on Cardcaptors (kiddified american version of Cardcaptor Sakura) and this just doesn't have the zing the other recordings of this track have.Discolocomove is annoying as well in this sense. Not as expected/previously heard. The main vocal breaks into something that suffers from the same syndrome ""na na na""'s background's do... and to top it off, the lyrics are different in the chorus. It's okay overall... but not what you will think if you order this one. I wouldn't buy this on a whim and I wish I hadn't gotten this one just yet."
3,weird cd,Really not the best cd. But the only good song i found was No nagging. Mainly you'll know this song from the toonami tracks. But i really dont reccomend this cd unless you really really love no nagging
5,Ancient One,"This CD, FroggyMix, No Nagging (Nanana-na)is one of the best ""Urban Musics"" out there!I really like all of the tracks on the CD,especially Track #3 No Nagging (Nanana-na)and Track #12 No Nagging (Zen Club Mix)This is similar to the Toonami Trax,(CardCaptors).I give this one 10 stars.Blessed be"

1,Waste,"I've bought 3 cartridges already, one from Amazon and 2 from the store and 2 of them were dry. What a waste. These cartridges are so crappy."
1,lacking in black ink,I purchased the refurbished Lexmark black cartridge 17G0050. Wasn't pleased with the quality of color of the ink. The black ink was more of a grayish color. I have purchased better quality refurbish cartridges.
2,COMPATIBILITY,"The current descriptions are fine IF you are in need of Lexmark or Epson JetInk Cartridges only. I would be delighted to see a chart made available to allow those of us with say, Canon or H/P Printers, to select the proper cartridge without the larger margin of error."
2,Really does run out too fast,"The quality is fine, but if you're someone who prints out lots of monochrome documents, you'd be better off looking elsewhere. Lexmark does sell a 'high capacity' cartridge, but it obviously costs more too. Here's a tip I found out - whenever you're not printing, turn the power off! I don't mean pull the plug or flip the switch on your surge protector. If you don't manually turn off the printer with the power button, the cartridge won't go back to its holding position, and it'll just dry out during the night. BUT even so, I found this cartridge ran out after, oh, 200-300 monochrome pages. For the amount of stuff I print out, I'd like a cartridge that can handle at least 1,000!"
2,Runs out too fast!,"After printing very few documents, this cartrige ran out of ink. Before I even bought this printer the salesperson warned me that it would run out quickly. I didn't think it could be that bad, but it IS!!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"it runs out of ink way too fast, its a waste of money.....too expensive for how long it DOESN'T last!"
2,Runs out too fast! - Lexmark 17G0050 Black Inkjet Cartridge,This cartridge runs out too fast! Look for another printer.
2,in betweeners,"definitely one-time use if you plan to wear them outside the house. theyre not comfortable enough to be a good slipper and not sturdy enough to be worn around. I wore them with a costume and they got pretty trashed at the party. were definitely better than heels, but i wouldn't choose this as my around-the-house comfy slippers"
4,"Comfy, cool and lightweight","I can't wear terrycloth slippers or fuzzy slippers because my feet get sweaty, so I do love Isotoner's satin ballerina slippers. They are comfortable with a nice stretch, and pretty durable as well. Finding them in my color and in XL definitely made my day!The elastic around the opening keeps these slippers on snugly, but doesn't cut into my feet too much on most days. I notice on days when I'm having swelling (due to circulatory issues) that I do get an indentation into my foot where the elastic sits, but it doesn't feel too binding, and doesn't leave a mark behind.The soles are a supple suede-like material which doesn't give a lot of ""grip,"" but I've never really felt myself slipping in them when I walk around in my home, on carpeted and linoleum floors. I would not wear these slippers to go outside, as I don't think the soles would stand up for very long to concrete or asphalt."
5,Nice!!!,The shipment arrived in an extremely timely manner and was in good condition when it arrived.
5,Isotoner ballet slippers,The slippers are lovely. I've worn these slippers in the past and obviously like them enough to buy them again. My feet have a tendency to swell. These slippers have just enough stretch to be comfortable and can even be worn outside.
5,NICE!,"I bought this as a gift, it was received very quickly. The quality was very nice, overall very please with service."
2,Isotoner Slipper,"I ordered tese as a girt for my mom in size large. When she opened them, although it said ""large"" on the attached packaging, the actual slippers were ""medium"" and therefore did not fit. :("
2,Not comfortable for me,"Purchased these hoping they would be cute and comfortable. Someone in my family has worn these every day for years. Unfortunately, for me they are not true to size. They fit small and dig into my heels. For this reason, I do not wear them. But, service from Amazon was great as always."
5,Great Item - VERY COMFY,"I bought these slippers for my wedding - and I'll use them for way more than that. A hint though - I'd buy the next size larger than the suggested size ratio.. I wear a 10 1/2 and bought an XXL just to be sure, and they fit perfectly! Very comfortable and they'll look great on my wedding day! Thanks!"
5,Only Slipper I Wear,"These Isotoner slippers have long been my and my daughter's favorite. Only wish they made a cool mesh fabric for summer wear. These were reasonably priced, saved me from going to an outlet mall several hours away to get a comparable price."
5,None better. Seriously.,"I've worn this brand and style of slipper for years and years, and highly recommend them. Actually, I'm on Amazon's site right now to buy another pair for myself and for a friend. They are durable and comfortable, good for around the house, dance or exercise classes, and I always bring a pair or two when I visit Las Vegas. I also have a pair at work. If you're unsure on size, I recommend choosing the larger one. Say your shoe size is 7 1/2 or 8, buy size large. Seriously, you can't go wrong with these."
4,Very comfortable,"The fit is great (I wear a size 9 and ordered XL), very comfy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are a little grandma-ish looking (I am late 30's), but other than that, I really like them."
5,Love these,"These are the perfect slippers. Lightly padded, washable. They replace an identical pair I bought 15 years ago that finally had a couple of holes appear in the suede soles."
4,Isotoner slippers,"I like the way they feel,the way they fit,comfortable,great for outside too ! I like the nice cushion for the bottom of your feet ! I would purchase these again !"
5,I look forward to wearing these slippers after getting home from work,"They look great after washing, the sole allows me to go outside while wearing them, no harm done. They are dressy enough that I've worn them during wedding receptions."
1,Ballerina Satin Isotoner Slippers,Product as ordered and received in excellent condition and arrived in very timely manner. In fact before date as stated. Very PLEASED.
5,Wonderful!,I absolutely love my shoes! I am going to be wearing them in my wedding. They are so comfortable and matched the item description perfectly!
5,Mommy's Favorite,"These are my mother in laws favorite slippers, I order her the same pair every year at Christmas. They are not as durable as most slippers, but well wort the price for one year of wear."
2,isotoner slippers,"Unlike previous pairs of isotoner slippers I have had, this pair is driving me nuts because the strings won't stay tied. My guess is that they were inferiorily made, I would not recommend this product."
2,bad slippers,"My wife has been wearing Isotoners for years, never a problem. But this time they are bad. They just don't fit like the ones we have always bought at JC Pennys. Just not as good, seems like they may be seconds or something. Anyway, not as good as before...."
3,They dig!,The satin and fabric and cushioning are all very nice. They keep my feet nice and warm but the elastic in the bag DIGS into my heel! I wear a size 8 - I bought a large which is supposed to fit between a 8 - 9 and there is plenty of room for my foot but the elastic in the back is just too constricting! If they eliminated this it would be the perfect slipper!
3,Seam in back of ankle/heel rubs on the skin....ouch!,"Aside from the folded seam on the backside of the ankle/heel area causing soarness, they are an atractive and comfy pair of slippers. But the agrivation of the skin is very uncomfortable."
3,ok...,They look exactly as pictured... fit a little small to size... about a whole shoe size smaller and their is cushion inside the slipper. Nothing amazing. More of an indoor shoe.
5,perfect fit and comfortable!!,lightweight and you don't have to worry about your slipper falling off. they are great to were around the house.
3,Ballet slippers run large,"I ordered up a size as suggested by many reviewers. Wish I had not.The slippers are about 2 sizes too large for me. Since they are slippers, I will not return them, but I would not order them again."
3,narrow fit,"I had these before but Does not seem to be made as wide, yet they are still better than most"
1,size chart for Isotoner ballerina slipper,"it didn't fit, will be returning this item. plus, the photo shows the bottom of the shoe as black but it is white"
2,Not the same! Elastic around heel doesn't adjust and is too tight,"I just bought these to replace an old pair that was worn out. The elastic around the heel is too tight! On the old pair, the elastic wrapped all the way around and came out at the front where you could adjust the tightness and then tie it into a bow, similar to ballet slippers. On these, the bow is just decorative and the elastic is too tight and uncomfortable. I'm sending them back!"
5,Isotoner slippers,"I've been buying these slippers for years. They are consistantly well made, comfortable, and don't slip off my feet going up and down stairs. I love them."
5,Isotoner ballet slippers,The slippers are extremely comfortable and the price was better than what I could find in any store. I am very pleased!
3,Isotoner slippers,I love the ballerina slippers as they are very comfortable to wear. Its difficult to find a small size in the stores which is why I purchased it online. Quality is lacking as the bows on top of the slipper came off after less than 1 week of wearing. Overall just OK.
5,perfect!,I bought these to wear for my wedding reception! So so so comfy :-) I decorated them with beautiful rhinestones and they were fabulous! I also bought matching ones in black for all my bridesmaids! They loved them! BEST slippers ever!!!
5,Isotoner Women's Ballerina Shoes,"My Australian friend is addicted to the shoes and so whenever I go to visit her, my entrance fee is several pairs of the shoes."
1,isotoner,i do not find the quality of the new isotoner to be of the high quality that we could previously expect---my experiences in ordering through amazon have been most satisfactory
4,Soft and pretty slippers,"I've been buying this type of slippers for years. They are soft and comfortable. Washable. 2 important points:-- the sizes run a little small. I wear a 7.5-8 size shoe, but I buy these slippers in L and they fit perfectly-- They do wear out pretty fast. I'd say they last about a year then the lining gets torn. And never wear these outside, the soles are very thin!"
1,Disappointed,"Purchased the white satin slippers and after 2 days of wear, there was a hole in the toe. Guess I'll stick with cheaper slippers that can be replaced easier. :("
3,Cute Cheetah Print,"I got these as house slippers. I do not know what happened, but I appear to have to left foot slippers. This could just be the rounded toe of the slipper, but both slippers seem to fit my left foot better. For the price point, I'm not complaining. The print is really cute and the soles are padded to make a comfy cushion to stand on. These are great on the cold hardwood floors at my house. I've worn these for a few mornings in a row and they seem to be conforming to my feet so I can visually see the difference between the slipper for my left foot and my right foot."
3,Nice but run small,"These are nice but I think they run small...I wear a size 7 shoe & ordered a medium. Wish I ordered a large, they are small & hurt the back of my heel because they are so tight. I keep waiting for them to stretch out like the other reviewers report but it doesn't seem to be happening. I like how these are machine washable though..."
4,Slipper,"I've had these kind of slippers before, I really like them. easy to put on and comfy enough. Better for summer wear then in the winter."
5,Love the slippers,I really love these slippers and they fit true to size. The slippers came in record time and it sure saved me for a very long gala I had to work. Thanks for a well made product and for always being so dependable on deliveries.
5,A beautiful gift from my husband,My husband gave me this watch as a gift after I gave birth to our first child. It is a very beautiful watch.
3,Not The Best....,"The past five Release Yourself mixes are much better than this one. The party mix is more electro-minimalist in sound, overall lacking the warmth and uplifting feel of the past Release Yourself mixes. Roger Sanchez is a great DJ, and 5 consistent mixes are more than anyone can expect from any House compilation series. Unfortunately, this one feels more like his After Dark mixes which suffer from the static sameness of sound which have marred so many House compilations lately. Minimalism makes fine listening music, but not dance music. If you like all the minimal dark electro sound that seems to be popular at the moment then you will probably love this mix - it is good for what it is. If you are looking for a great party mix like the Release Yourself mixes of the past then you will be probably be disappointed."
4,Fun verse for those who enjot tobacco!,"Pipe and Pouch is a great book for people who love poetry and an occassional smoke. In an age when tobacco users are a group of almost outcasts, this book gives pleasure and comfort to the stalwart smoker. Light that pipe or cigar and join Daniel Webster, William Cowper, Lord Byron and others as they sing odes and sonnets to the joys of tobacco."
2,Cuts not cutting it,"I'm an avid Richard Laymon fan but have to confess to being very disappointed with this one.Sure, the bad guy is bad and you don't like him but he's lame as well. Richard Laymon doesn't draw out of the reader the level of fear and anger that his bad guy's usually do.The interweaving of the plot and how it meets up at the end is clever as usual but with this one you sense it coming and you are able to guess before even reaching mid-way through the book who will dispatch the bad guy.There is a plot error as well which is a first with a Laymon tale for me. One of the character's has to fly by plane to reach her daughter, however, the bad guy, in the reverse trip from daughter to mother just happens to be able to pop in his car and drive over in a matter of minutes.The character's and personalities of the anchoring character's are not strong enough or detailed enough to hook the reader into feeling sympathy or suspense for them.Overall, very weak I thought.Cuts"
1,cuts richard laymon,This is probably the worst book I have ever read. It is childish and predicatble not to metion very poorly written. I have read several Richard Laymon books before this one and have found them to be ok.I can not believe that Stephen King has read this book or he would not have allowed his name to be used in the reviews. It is absolue rubbish. I am glad that I purchased this book as an e book and only paid $6.41 for it. Do not waste your money on this one.
1,Dated,"Maybe I'm too old for this stuff. But I wanted to take a shower after reading. I picked it up because of the author's entry in ""Triage"". I was disappointed. The killer was a freak, but I could have cared less for all the others. And that's not how it's supposed to be."
4,For serial killer lovers,Easy read but I got somewhat confused on some of the characters. Plenty of suspense and gore.
3,could use some major improvements,"Ok so they have made some improvements, I have the older version, it is minus the cup holder, and the canopy is a bit different. that being said this stroller still needs imporvements. My biggest complaint is that the front wheel doesn't move (yes I knew that before I bought it) but untill you push this stroller with 55lbs of kid in it you have no Idea how difficult it is to push down on the handle to lift the front wheel and turn. my other problem is that my kids shoulders overlap (which causes fights and pushing). overall this is a good choice if you only run/walk on a straight path but where I live the paths have twists and turns. On the plus side I do like the basket and the front wheel is easy to take on and off (for storage)."
1,Extremely Dangerous!!,"I bought this jogger and five months later the seat belts actually broke! My second child hadn't even been born yet. My son, only a year old pulled on the shoulder straps and they tore in half! Then I inspected the lap belt and found it nearly severed as well. He would have FALLEN OUT!! When I tried to return it to Babies R Us they said they couldn't resell it so they wouldn't take it back- not even for store credit. Well of course they couldn't resell it. I expected better from Babies R Us. Someone could get seriously hurt. I was lucky I noticed the tear in the lap belt (it was under the harness buckle). There were other problems as well, it never did keep air in the tires, it didn't track well, and it was quite rickety. I just bought the Dreamer Design Ditto (not sold at Babies R Us) and got rid of the Expedition. What a waste of money and time!"
3,Not a must have!,"I am a mother of two (2 1/2years and 4 months) and thought that a double jogging stroller would be great to be out and about with. It is a very easy stroller to use. The kids enjoy being in it. It seems rather comfortable for them. My 2 1/2year old climbs in it without being asked or putting up a fight. My only complaint is the front wheel. It is not a swivel wheel, therefore, it is VERY annoying to try and turn the stroller. You have to push down on the bar to get the front wheel off the ground. That is fine if it is once in a while, but it gets a little hard when you need to turn many different times."
1,straps made overeas wear and unreplaceable,"Per a discussion with the company trying to replace the very worn straps. This product is made overseas, they can't sell you just the straps, and only keep parts for 4-5 years. I feel this product costs too much for it to be unrepairable in 8 years."
1,worst stroller ever,"This is the worst product I have ever spent money on. The quick release mechanism has never worked properly. I returned it and Baby Trend claimed to have fixed it. However, the issue was not resolved and it is not safe. The seats fold toward each other and my kids lay on each other when riding. It is not a good product and the company is not helpful at all."
4,GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY! GOOD BUY,"This jogger was not my first choice but the price was a big factor. I have a 3 month old and a 3 year old. Putting it together was very easy. You only need to assemble the tires, parent tray and foot rest. Very easy. I jog with it and it is very smooth. Both my kids are comfortable. I do put a blanket under my three month old for comfort and added stability. The seats rests area little flimsy but hey for the price they work and my three year old has not complained. The sun protector work pretty well although I will buy a UVA blocker that goes over the entire stroller. I recommend this stroller. Not top of the line but for the money it's great. Oh, and it folds up very easily. A big plus."
3,Double Jogger,It was faily easy to put together and seem'to ride fine. I just wish it was not so heavy and takes up a lot of space.
2,"Nice ride, not convenient at all","I bought this stroller for my infant and preschool aged daughters since it was the only one I could find in the store that would accomodate my 3 year old's long legs. We took it to a theme park and although the ride was comfortable, and it was pretty easy to push, I also found that the kids seemed to ""tip"" into eachother and that the seats just didnt sit straight no matter how we adjusted them.We also found to my extreme disappointment that it would not fit into my trunk without removing the front wheel. I have a pretty big car, so that surpised me. Needless to say, this was returned to the store."
5,Great for the money!,"I bought this stroller about 2 years ago and I absolutely love it. It folds up so easy that Grandparents can do it without a sweat. It takes some time getting used to the front wheel not turning to the sides, but the big wheels are great and ride over any and everything without a sweat, even in dirt. The seats recline for younger kids and seatbelts adjust really easily. Has lots of storage area. With other strollers I found it uncomfortable to push because the handle was so low, I'm only 5'7, but this was perfect.My babies love this and always want to go for rides in it."
4,great stroller,"We have twin girls, 3 months old, and this stroller has been great. It is perfect for walks outside and is very easy to manuever. There is no struggling around bumps, sticks or sand. The stroller rolls over any terrain easily (believe me, my husband has tested it out!)The babies have had no problems with staying in place, and the seats adjust so that they lean back comfortably.The stroller is a little wide for tight shopping in malls, etc., but is fine for wide-aisled places.I do have to take the wheels off to fit it in my car trunk, but they are easy to remove and replace, so it is not a big deal.The biggest problem that I have is that I cannot find a rain canopy for the double stroller. They make one for the single, but I don't think they have one for the double. I am going to try another brand of rain cover and I hope it fits."
2,One seriously PAINFUL mistake!,"This is an affordable stroller, but not even worth the $180.00. I have a 2 and 3 year old who have both gotten pinched at the folding mechanism while riding in the stroller. This is due to the fact that you have to lift the front end up to turn any sized corner. Last weekend my three year old got her entire pinky finger stuck in the joint (the folding joint is right at the kids' arm rest/elbow area). I had to unfold the stroller to get her finger out! This stroller is by far NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY! I just hope we can get our money back!We have a Subaru Forester, and even when folded, the stroller does not fit in the back without having 1/4 of the stroller hanging over the kid's heads in the backseat...horrible design."
2,Not worth it,When I bought the stroller the front wheel was bent and the the stroller is very hard to steer. If it wasn't so hard to return it I would have sent it back.
1,So bad I returned it,"I had a double jogger-- a no-name brand- that I bought on Ebay a few years ago. If was fine, a bit big. When it was time for a new one, I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I really only use this to go around our neighborhood and the occasional outing. For every day use, I use a MacLaren stroller. I used this one for about a week. At first is seemed heavier to push and navigate, but I liked the cup holder/snack holder. This one reclined better than my old one so I kept at it. I tried inflating the tires more thinking that would help. I think the problem is the handle bar is lower than my old one so the leverage to lug around a 4 year old and 20 month old was just too much for this stroller. I found it heavy though, even with just the baby riding alone. So, I dismantled it and returned it. Thankfully I had the recipt and Babies r us has a good return policy. I think I am going to get the Instep TT with the front swivel wheel."
1,Beware. Not as pictured.,"Warning... this is not the ""Adjust-a-Gate"" sold by Hoover Fence, but instead the one sold by Jewett-Cameron elsewhere on the site. It's also not black as pictured, but instead a putty gray. When shipping, the gates were damaged due to inappropriate packaging (they were shipped in their ""shelf"" box and had to be returned. See pix in customer pix section."
4,Good product,Good product if your making your own gate and want it to last i got two for a double swing driveway gate for my RV
1,Crap,"This product was not as described. It is not a 36-60 inch gate, in actuality it was more like 36 with the extensions all the way out. I had to go to home depot and purchase longer braces and another adjuster cable (new cable because the one you sent me was broken) just to make it work. I also had to order wheels because the gate is already starting to sag due to the poor quality. Do not trust this seller, the product is crap.Also, when I received the boxes they had holes punched in the front and back then patched with clear tape, great job seller. I hope you lose sales over this post."
1,"Dated, so many better options available--","At its best, this is a period piece. But for the beginning boat builder it is not one I would recommend. As one who has built a boat and am building a second, there are a number of other titles that deliver a more satisfying and beneficial read. The information though authentic is dated. Browse Woodenboat Magazine's Bookstore site and examine their numerous titles there before purchasing this option. For a title from the same time period, I heartily recommend: How to Build Wooden Boats: With 16 Small-Boat Designs (Paperback)available here at Amazon."
2,too many testimonials,"I kept the leonard rossiter and kenneth williams discs, and threw out the others, and I kept these as I always found these two actors particularly funny, but all the discs share the same defect of having too many other people talking about the actors and not enough actual footage of the wondeful work they were capable of."
3,The not worth the money waffle book,"Very small book for the price, no recipies for basic waffles, way too much money for this so-so book."
3,Cut short,"The movie is pretty well done and explores Darwin's early insights and thinking on evolution. It follows the Beagle voyage through it's early stages but then abruptly ends just as he is heading for the Galapogos islands. The movie almost completely ignores ""the rest of the story"" - his return to England, his refinement of the theory, his hesitation in publishing, and so on. It provides some basic concepts of evolutionary theory but fails to provide a comprehensive story."
2,Great idea with a design flaw,"I have the Safari TT Dbl jogger from In Step and I bought this shade because the shade on the stroller is non-existent.I have seen this product work well on single strollers, but it keeps blowing up and back from my canopy with the slighest of breezes, so it is not doing such a great job of keeping the sun off my kid's faces.I've used a binder clip to keep it in place, but it still blows back more than I think it should..."
1,Flips easily,"Although it provides WONDERFUL coverage, it flips back (hitting me) during fast walks or with a slight breeze. You can forget jogging with it."
2,Double Stroller Shade,"I ordered the shade for my twin stroller. I had to sew on a velcro strap onto the Kiddopotamus tag at the top of the shade to add some weight to the shade, because it flies up constantly. I then can velcro the top of the shade to the tray of the stroller to provide shade while the babies are sleeping. Also helps hold the front of the shade onto the stroller, otherwise the shade doesn't provide shade if babies are in a flat position in the stroller, with the front of the shade flying up constantly. Sewing on the velcro strap has helped make the shade useable, otherwise I don't think it would be useable due to it flying up constantly, and the babies like to pull it down as well."
2,A Nuisance,"We got this cover for our double stroller because the visor is short. Well this just didn't work. Very flimsy. To keep it on the stroller we had to attach it real low, thus making it so our children couldn't see. We just put sunscreen and hats on our children instead."
2,Not as good as expected,I bought this for my twin stroller. It had no instructions and the pictures was to small to see if i was putting it on right. It does cover my chidren from the sunlight but doesnt work well if there is a breeze. It blows backwards too easily but i may not have it fastened correctly. I thought i needed this as soon as i received my stroller but now i wish i would have saved my money and found something else.
3,Flimsy - works ok though,"Like all the other reviews, this really is a very flimsy sun shade. It does the trick for us though for the most part. It obviously would be better if the shade did not blow back at the slightest hint of a breeze."
4,Pretty Good Universal thingy,"The shade works well for out twins 2 strollers, but it is a bit flippy in the wind. It is very universal though which is nice, we can use it for both of out strollers."
4,pretty good product,"I ordered this product so that my twins would be covered while we are walking/strolling around Disney. The shade was great for the sun, but it wasn't good for the rain at all. I do recommend this product since my children didn't get burned at all."
3,"Good, but...",This shade does indeed cover almost everything. But it is extremely susceptible to blowing back in the slightest wind. I've honestly had to adjust my walking route depending on which way the wind is blowing.
4,Great product,This is a great product; it provides so much more sunshade for my kids - it's nice when they fall asleep becuase you can pull it down really far!
4,A must have for us!,This product has turned out to be one of my favorite purchases. I use it for my twin stroller (Graco duorider) and it works great! We live where it is windy and unless your walking directly into the wind it works just fine. I use a clothespin to clip it down if I happen to be walking into the wind and that helps. This is rarely a problem though. It covers my twins and keeps the sun off of them and that's the important thing. Without it my Graco Duorider shade is not nearly enough to cover them.
4,Worth the money,"I love this shade. It doesn't stand up to the wind, but if you pull it far enough down towards the bar of the stroller it usually stays put. I have my toddler hold it on those windy days if we're having a problem with it blowing back at me. The shade serves its purpose, it keeps the harmful rays away from my beautiful little ones."
3,Definitely not 5 stars,"I bought this sun shade because the stroller we have has a short shade and doesn't cover the kids. The problem that I have with this is that with any breath of wind it blows back against the stroller. I've tried putting a book clip on the end hoping to weight it down a bit, and it's helped somewhat. It's still a pain when it doesn't stay out."
5,Great product!,I always get asked where I bought this by other parents. Works great and it has held up with all four of my kids. I have had it for about five years now and it has lasted and stays clean. Love the light fabric.
2,Blessing or Curse?,"In theory, this product seems like a great idea, however, the SLIGHTEST breeze sends the Rayshade everywhere but where you want it to be. I don't exactly find it enjoyable to have to adjust this product every block or so during my walks and jogs."
3,Lots of Cover but...,"THis shade provides alot of cover. It was perfect...until a SLIGHT breeze started going. I was really bummed. I haven't tried to use it down at the beach yet. But over all, I wouldn't return it."
2,Use a crib sheet instead=),I live in Northern CA on the coast and where I tried to use this the wind even on a light day would blow it backwards. The sun kept getting in the kids eyes so I started using a crib sheet and it worked like a charm! I can see if you lived somewhere with no breeze that it may work.
3,"Does the trick, unless there is wind","This shade does work, but in a wind it blows around a lot. In a strong wind it will blow back and the kids will not be shaded. I bring clamps with me and clamp the shade down on the sides of the stroller, and this keeps it from blowing up."
4,Does it's Job,"I bought this to block out the sun, and it does just that. I also like that it's very flexible and stretches very far forward when the sun is right in my girls' faces, and that I can fold it in with the stroller. What I don't like about it is that I cannot use it in the wind-it just won't stay put. It has also gotten caught on things and snags easily. But it was worth the purchase."
2,Shade is not good in the wind,"I purchased this shade for our double jogging stroller which has a tiny shade in order to provide better coverage. What we found is that the shade is so flimsy that the slightest bit of wind (either actual wind or just air when you are running) causes the shade to flop all over, folding in on the kids or over the stroller, and just basically becoming useless. It's really good when there is not any wind and we're just walking, but needs to be stiffened up to use all the time. Mostly it just becomes an annoyance."
2,Sun shade serves purpose with clamps,"This sun shade definitely extends the coverage of the shade that most strollers come equipped with but, in order for it to stay in place (especially on a slightly windy day), you have to clamp it down."
4,Worth it,"This product is better than I thought it would be, after reading other reviews. I took a chance and love it. The wind does bend it back, but you can tighten it by streching it out. It has long velcro straps that allow you to attach it almost anywhere on the stroller. I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 7 month old. I have my baby covered more than my older child. This product allows you to do that. I think this product is a must when buying the double stroller. It is a shame that the stroller itself doesn't have a better one on it to begin with."
2,"Arrangement, Editing and Mixing","This is a disappointing CD. The mixing sometimes drowns out Hvorostovsky's voice. I enjoyed his voice when it wasn't ruined by the arrangement and mixing. You would think that this music, ""Passion di Napoli"" would be gentle and pleasing to hear. But that idea is ruined by the excessive ""banging"" on drums."
2,Great Hayek essay,"This is the only source I know for F.A. Hayek's essay ""The Creative Powers of a Free Civilization."" Most of the remaining essays are indifferent, but the Hayek one is very important."
3,Decent Case but Overpriced and Not Ideal,"This is a decent ipod case, but I am not 100% thrilled with it. The best feature is the plastic cover that protects the video screen. It also has a nice texture. However, I had to cut a hole in the top of it in order to use the ""hold"" button (which is an extremely important ipod feature). Also, it collects a lot of dirt and it's impossible to keep the case clean. All in all, I think that it's good protection for the ipod, but I would not pay the $35 retail price for it."
3,Very good protection but too many flaws,"I take extremely good care of my stuff so I decided to spend 30$ on this case for me new iPod. The case is very good looking and sits very well on the iPod. It also supplies very good protection for it (including protection from liquid spills). However it has a few flaws:1. It is harder to control the ipod because all the buttons aren't easy to reach/press/roll at all. The hold button is hard to reach, the roller doesn't it's sharpness, etc.2. The silicon leaves some sort of residue on the iPod. When I take off the case, every few weeks, the iPod is covered in some sort of thin gue. Whipes off easy but not nice at all.3. Although it's silicon thus being thin and everything, the iPod is twice as thick it's normal size. Too bad...My recommendation: If you want really good protection it's for you, however if you take good care of your things like I do, buy some sort of scratch protection stickers and you'll be fine."
4,Great protection!,"So far the best covering/protector for the iPod video i've owned. I previously had some ""hard case"" type protectors, which were OK, but increased the size of the unit considerably--I suppose that's the tradeoff you make. The EVO also increases the overall size, but a little less than others.In addition, it's nice to see a rubberized case that doesn't REALLY collect lint/dust so rapidly. Truthfully, all of these rubbery/silicone cases are going to pick up dirt/hair/dust eventually, but so far, this one has picked it up a little less.My only gripes are 1) it's a bit of a production to put it on/take it off (so you may want to leave it on for a while). 2) This product--as with many iPod products--is a bit overpriced. Other than that, not a bad little purchase!"
3,Good but not enough,This is a very good cover but it has a major issue: when I use it the Ipod does not fit anymore in my IM3c audio system. I have to remove it at each time!
5,SIMPLY THE BEST!!!,"Pros:Very good build quailityGives perfect protectionVery good looking and stylish, well designed to go with ipod's lookCons:Adds a little volume to the sleek ipod which is a natural resultDoes not go with the Belkin battery pack that I boughtOverall very happy with this skin! Well worth the 20 bucks."
2,"decent product (though expensive), bad service","the iSkin is the best ipod cover i found for the new ipod videos, but it's a bit overpriced. service however was horrible. they waited for like three weeks before they even decided to ship it."
4,Important Supplement for Students of Greek.,"The Greek New Testament is recorded on 22 CD's. Mr. Zodhiates reads each verse in a slow deliberate manner, quite useful for the student of Greek.Mr. Zodhiates uses the Modern Greek pronunciation, which does diverge from the Koine Greek. I didn't find this to be a problem. My goal as a student is to pronounce the words so that they may be understood, and Zodhiates makes a strong case for using Modern Greek in reading the New Testament.At less than $70, this is a very good addition to your Greek Library."
4,Greek NT Audio,"It's so nice to have the modern pronunciation for the Gree NT. I hope the pronunciation used in school's starts doing this. The reading speed is just right, not too fast or slow. Only drawback is I have to manually input the text references in iTunes; the publisher should already have this all done."
4,Koine Greek CDs,"I enjoy listening to the CDs and following along in my Interlinear Greek New Testament. However, it's awfully hard to find a certain passage.I would like to find these CDs in a form where I could type in the book and chapter and have it come up without spending so much time trying to locate it."
4,Brown Roots Watches City,"Roots Watches City - BrownThis was a gift sent directly to the out-of-state recipient. She was delighted, said it was even better than the picture looked on-line!"
5,this stuff is great!,This product was worth every penny. It tans SO nicely & with the SPF there's no burn. Would definitely buy again
1,"Terrible, Pretentious Pontifications","A truly terrible read... This book is written like some sort of hiphop, dada, coffee shoppe manifesto.The texts can fit into one of three categories: Self-referential boastings, references of others accomplishments (Spooky's M.O.) or some sort of patchwork rambling about technology sprinkled with fifty-cent phrases and urbanisms like ""check the flow"" and ""flip the script.""Sigh...Spooky tries to defend this garbage in the acknowledgements section by saying ""try to make people think and they'll hate you.""Spare me."
3,Depends on the Reader,"Rhythm Science is definitely one of those books that can be viewed in extreme opposite lights depending on the sort of mindset the reader is. This book is not for those that aren't already interested in DJ Spooky/Miller or the DJ culture. I read it for a class, and it was tough to get through. Upon reflection and reading through it again, I was able to appreciate it more.As a previous review has already stated, as you read this book, it is essential to give your thought patterns to Miller, to submerge your mind into the text in order to really get into the flow of the book and fully understand what Miller is saying.I completely agree with others, though. The CD that serves as the book's audio companion is far better than the book itself.Overall, it is an interesting read, but unless you have the time and willingness to dive into the book and not surface until you're finished, I wouldn't bother."
1,Nicely illustrated but uninformative,"A ghoulish item for the coffee table with lots of pictures but little in information. Of no use to the scholar of this subject or of history in general.Overall, not very good."
3,Buster Crabbe 11-item box set,Buster Crabbe CollectionThis 11-disc box set is of very good quality even though some material is available elsewhere. The price is exceptional for the quality and I have no objections to having this set in my collection
3,Predictable pattern,"I have read many of JAK novels ... and it is a readable novel, however it is at times so chauvinist that you wonder that how is written by a woman. It becomes annoying at times...The female characters initially rejects the male dominant and pushy behavior and does not want to have a permanent relationship him. However... there is a change in the male character that makes her accept him and things take a turn. Also the pattern makes it a bit predictable."
5,No CD-Key,"I only rated this game 5 out of 5 because I don't want to give a bad rating when I'm not actually reviewing the game.I made the stupid mistake of not fully checking the description of the product. I got the game. But no CD-Key! I can never play it. I am not a hacker, and so I am mad at myself. But just make sure you know what your buying before you buy it. If it does not include a game manual, there is no CD-Key! Just a warning."
3,I guess no complaints,"over all I have to say they are about what I expected. A high quality router bit they are not. but for the number of bits and the price, I think they are worth it. I have only used a few of them so far, but so far so good. It would have been nice though if they would have included more practical, common bits. I doubt I will ever use half of them."
2,rate a router bit by bit,"recently purchased this product because i recently bought a house and i wanted to do all the EZ stuff they show on TV, BIG MISTAKE to buy tools or tool accessories online without the help of a pro. these bits chewed more wood then my old dog . FYI on DIY ask a pro at the big box store first"
2,Low End junk,"I haven't used these at all, but since that doesn't seem to be a requirement for giving the world your opinion I thought I'd jump right in here. The last quarter-round bit I bought at BigHomeBox cost me $43 - 15 years ago, so no way are you getting anything like quality here.Like the Indian drill bit set I bought and that ""bargain"" open/box-end wrench set I got from Taiwan, this would be more worthless ADD/OCD eye-candy cluttering up my workshop. If you needed something in a pinch to finish a weekend project, then I could see buying junk instead of going without, but if you are in a pinch what are you doing ordering online? This is an item that makes zero sense to me anyway I look at it."
1,Disappointed,It's pretty disappointing when you think you are going to get 2 radios and only get one. It would be nice if it said exactly how many you would recieve. What point is it to only have one radio anyway.
5,the cheapest radio and is the best,"when i was looking for a radio i found this one but i think ,the price is too cheap ots going to be very bad but today i get it and is the best radio and very cheap ernesto"
3,A so-so performance of Wagner -- You can do better,"This CD was a disappointment, maybe because the recording technology is rather dated and the excitement and presence of the music does not come through. Birgit Nilsson is, of course, spectacular.A better selection can be found in the Panorama edition of ""der ring des nibelungen"" with von Karajan conducting. Karajan's interpretation is great, and Janowitz is the best Sieglinde ever recorded. Tracks 14 - 16 of the 2 CD Panorama set will take your breath away."
4,It doesn't sound that good as I expected,"Though it doesn't sound like a tin can like its bare aluminum siblings, it still sounds a little bit like a metal can. A lot of times, it doesn't sound natural at all. The best is the wood covered one."
1,Hate-mongering,"I'm not Baha'i- I'm Christian. And this work is a disgrace to Christiandom. It is mostly ravenous falsehood and terrible fallacy. The Baha'i may not be right, but fighting incorrectness with lies and hate is rediculous. I recommend this book for studies in foolishness."
2,Not even close to her Greatest,"Although there are a few good cuts on this collection, despite the generally terrible arrangements, almost any other collection of Billie's is better. If you want a single disc Greatest Hits album, try an obscure Brit import called ""Fine and Mellow."" The only thing the DECCA CD has going for it is better sound quality, because it was recorded much later than most of her good recordings."
5,Like Billie Hoiliday?,The recording is well done. Billie Holiday was a great vocalist in the swingband era.The collection of songs are a reflection of her musical talent.
5,Couldn't Be Better,Good collection of Ms. Holiday's favorites. Clear sound as well. Enjoy it very much! Great serivce from the vendor also.
3,"Somewhat funny, but rather repetetive","If you like adult-oriented techno, then this could be something for you. But, 7 versions on the same theme can be too much..."
3,nice but.....,but knockouts happen everyday. nothing too special about any of the knockouts here either. unless you have a favourite fighter who knocked someone out or someone got knocked out that you don't like. don't waste your money
3,Too sweet for me,"I think that folk music should sound true to the voice and the heart of the person(s) who perform it. Burl Ives' music shows nothing of the man. Burl was no Captain Kangaroo! All these songs are like Audio Treacle, listening to them is like swallowing a mouth full of syrup. ""Polly Wolly Doodle!"" ""Blue Tail Fly!"" There's no edge to this music!That said, I will agree that this is highly suitable for children, assuming their parents can tolerate it. And I love Burl's rendition of ""Lavender Blue, (Dilly Dilly)"" even though it is a silly song. I guess I have a soft spot. I'll probably listen to this once a year, while I'm gorging on a big carton of ice cream."
4,Raw vocal beauty,"Galina Gorchakova has always been a controversial singer. People either love her raw, untamed sound or hate it. I have always been in the former category and I still am, despite a few technical problems which never seem to go away. Some of her high notes on this album are so flat and weak that I'm surprised they didn't do another take. I've heard her do Leonora's aria better on two other recordings. And she's not exactly a master of subtlety, particularly in her high register. But the beauty of her enormous voice and the way she completely throws herself into her characters, in my opinion, more than makes up for technical flaws. Verismo doesn't have to be sung perfectly anyway. I much prefer the raw emotion of this disc to the bland interpretations in Jane Eaglen's new album of much the same repertoire. In particular, the three death scenes (Butterfly, Manon, and Liu) are very powerful."
3,Is it new?,"I got the item, no plastic around, no box, no paper. Now I just have to hope that it is really new and not used!!"
4,Good replacement battery,"Battery fit right into my old ups, and was a perfect match for the old one. Replacement was a snap."
5,good coffee but..,"This is my favorite starbucks roast, but why dont you just go to your local starbucks to purchase this, its the same price if you just go there and you dont have to pay for shipping and handeling and all that stuff, plus they will grind it for you there."
1,This is a rip off!,"The ad states 128/roll, 20/carton, therefore it appears you are buying 20 rolls, this is NOT TRUE my shipment came today and it was ONE roll! This is a lie and completely misleading!I am EXTREMELY disappointed in amazon.com for advertising this, I have never had any problems with them before and will think twice before I EVER order from them again!"
1,BE WARNED--FALSE ADVERTISING!!,This is absolutely false advertising. Amazon should intervene. About a dozen military families (including myself) ordered this thinking it was for 20 rolls- it says 20 rolls/carton and 18.6 pounds shipping weight. THIS IS ACTUALLY ONLY FOR ONE ROLL OF PAPER TOWELS!!!!! This company ripped off military families and when they were made aware of the error they still left the listing up! They should really be ashamed.
