4,Does An Anti-Science Faction Seem Familiar,"H. G. Wells, a bona fide genius. He predicted the near-term: World War II (and beyond) bombing of cities, and he predicted further and no doubt further than now. Who can imagine a future society in which a good fraction of the ""leaders"" are anti-science? H. G. Wells could."
3,Not 120 minutes version as advertised on back of box...,This is a landmark science fiction movie from H.G. Wells but it is not the 120 minutes that his advertised on the back of the box. It is only 95 minutes which is on the tape itself. Just a warning for future perspective buyers. It's not a bad transfer and appears to be the original aspect ratio but not what is advertised.
2,Disapointed,"Had seen this movie years ago when I was a kid. This movie is very poorly restored, and the colorized version is no help."
3,Things To Come,"We had to do a film review of this movie inour Senior High film lit class. We sort oflaughed about it then, but then I ordered itfrom amazon and watched it again and it wasgreat. Im so glad that many of the films Ienjoyed in my youth are now on dvd and canorder them from amazon."
4,"Visually, a stunning movie","Before post-apocolyptic war movies became common and overdone, Things to Come was a stunning cinematic masterpiece that had breath-taking special effects for the 1930's.A technique using mirrors at different angles to project the actor's image onto a miniature model, the sets for the future are quite impressive. The special effects really are great. The montages of the advanced technology in the future, and the scene of thousands of people swarming around the rocket are mind boggling when you think about the year this movie was done.Raymond Massey is excellent, as always. If you don't want to watch it for the special effects, just watch it for him. This is a must for a Raymond Massey fan."
3,Not as tasty as Cake... or Pie,"I heard about this slight repacking of Cake and Pie and was intrigued. Heard it today at a store and must say it was a mistake to do this. First the Hello Lisa 'thing' simply doesn't do anything for anyone, especially Lisa. To not lead off with ""The Way it Really Is"", is mistake number 2. Mistake 3 is in kicking off Kickstart (WOW what a mistake!). Lastly, it seems a bit underhanded to make fans buy 2 discs for 3 new songs. Yeah, I know all about the record company change, and yeah thats rough, but why not just include these songs on the next cd?If you only have THIS disc I reccommend Cake and Pie... which has Kickstart and also Too Fast Driving is really cool too.Oh, and how is the packaging of Cake and Pie not more desireable than the Hello Kitty one...? Am I missing something?"
1,Buyer Beware!,"I must have missed the fine print. I didn't realize this album was just a rehash of the last one. What a rip-off! Do not waste your money on this CD if you have the last one. The back of the CD states that unauthorized duplication is a violation. Read the fine print, Lisa."
2,Sorry Lisa,"I went looking for Lisa Loeb's first CD 'Tails'. Instead of 'Tails' they had this, and I had to buy it... well because of the cute cover. At first listen I didn't really care for this CD but the more you listen to it, the more it grows on you. Sort of, anyway. My favorite song on this album is 'Someone You Should Know'. I don't know why but I think the chorus sounds like a choir singing in the background. Other average-okay songs include: 'What Am I Supposed To Say' (the accoustic version) and 'The Way It Really Is'. But pretty much the rest of the album isn't that great. It isn't exactly bad, just kinda...blah. I wouldn't reccomend this album to anyone unless you're a Lisa Loeb fanatic. Her debut cd 'Tails' is a little better, but not that much. I don't think I'll be buying anymore Lisa Loeb CDs in the future."
5,AJ's Real #1 FAN!,"Ring was fairly easy to put together. The 6 posts were a little hard to push in but, not bad. I bought this for my nephew for Christmas after showing him my ""Best of AJ STYLES VOL. 1"". He's just about to turn 7 and was not really into wrestling until seeing AJ's magic on DVD! He asked if I could get him some AJ Styles stuff for Christmas and I bought the only 1 left on Amazon.com at the time. He's constantly playing with it and it seems to be very durable. Definitely recommend this and the TNA brand to anyone looking."
4,pretty good,"the ring is fun.but,putting in the turn post was really getting me angry.for people that are gonna buy it,wen u put the turn posts in,apply some pressure.because if u don't,it keeps falling.and putting to much can break the post.i like how they gave u the aj styles figure.unlike the wwe figures,on the bak of the figure,there's a thing where wen u push it down,the arms moves.so i'd sey this was a good deal for 16.99"
2,God is a Secret,"Boo! Thumbs down! What a disappointment! I listen to their other cd's all the time but this one is not worth listening to. The lyrics are very shallow. They must have given in to the guy in, ""God is Not a Secret - Take me to Your Leader"", who said ""drop the god and emphasize the beat"". It's been boiled down to show biz."
5,The Newsboys rule the christian world,"I just got back from seeing these guys in the Love,Liberty,Disco tour and I have to say it was one of the best shows I have ever seen.These five guys will leave you in such high spirits like you wouldn't belive,but by the end of the show you will belive like never before!"
2,newsboys are ok,i got the new cd i used to like it but after my friend told me she went to one of there tours and they where mean to her i dont listen to it much you got to care about your fans i know it must be hard being a great band but treat your people alittle better and mabe they will give there lives to the lord you got to care for thouse non christians and show them the love of god these guys are really great its just the thing with my friend why i rated so low
5,love liberty disco,Newsboys new album is fantastic from song #1 to song #10. They have a winner in this album. The songs get you going. I recommed this CD to everybody who likes the Newsboys and even to those that are not familiar with the Newsboys.
3,Old-school Newsboys,"I bought this CD simply because I have liked the Newsboys CDs in the past, but was very suspicious of their disco-theme. Nonetheless this CD is full of great songs with a very groovy beat and sound lyrics."
4,Newsboys are changing,"Don't expect the same sound you heard from Take Me To Your Leader. They have continued in the same direction they headed with Step Up To The Microphone. After listening through it a couple of times, I have become addicted. If you're willing to deal with change, get this one. (Number 9 is the best!)"
4,I Still Don't Understand Why They Say it's Bad,"I don't care what all those album reviewers say, this album is a piece of art. In order to fully appreciate the beauty of the songs on this album, you must try to understand. Probably the two greatest songs ever written, Beautiful Sound and Forever Man, are on this album. Do very many see them that way? No. Why? Because people don't appreciate the precious faith in God these songs show. Just listen to me, buy this CD, but don't expect all disco, but buy it because it has words in it that define life in a whole new perspective. The best songs other than Beautiful Sound and Forever Man are Love Liberty Disco, Good Stuff, Say You Need Love, Break, Fall On You. Why that's almost all of them! Who says this is bad?"
2,NO NO NO NO NO!,"I bought this CD and I was really disapointed. Newsboys are my fav. band and when I bought this cd I thought it was pretty much a waste of money. I have all there albums and I am most likely one of there biggest fans. and I say Excluding ""read all about it"" this is the biggest disappointment. I liked 1 song, and that was ""break"" if it didn't have that awesome song I would rate this album one star!"
2,Maybe just not my style,"I really enjoyed their other cds, but this cd just didn't appeal to me at all. I went to a couple of their concerts, and I didn't enjoy their 'disco' one very much. It just seems like they are re-inventing the wheel in this CD. Though I like the band itself and their Christian stance is commendable, I was thoroughly disappointed in this CD."
4,GREAT CD!,"The Newsboys is a great cd. And is one of the Best of all the Newsboys CD's. I especially like Number 1, and Love Liberty Disco. You will find yourself listening to this cd over and over again. Its really easy to catch onto the words and has a great tune to it. It has Slow and Fast Songs and all of them are good. THis is a must for everyone!"
3,Bummer,I really expected more out of Newsboys after Step Up. This just wasn't was what I was looking for. The title cut is probably the best song as well as track 9
1,Save your money - skip this CD... What's the big secret?,"First off, big Newsboys fan here, so this is a review from someone who likes their tunes. But...If I had it to do over again, I would have skipped this CD. It's nothing special. From the weak tunes (where's the big sound we heard on previous Newsboys CD's?), to the completely unreadable lyrics in the CD sleeve, to the muffled spiritual overtures in the songs, I have to say about this CD: ""what's the secret?"". This one does not compare to previous Newsboys efforts...a real disappointment.One could hardly tell that from the music on this CD that its a Christian album, especially compared to the very vocal faith in previous Newsboys CD's.However, I'll go see them in concert - hopefully the stage show can make up for this very weak CD!"
3,"I dunno, strange","I was really, really suprised with this album and I have aboslutely loved the band since Going Public, and they seem they have gone through another Going Public Phase. But worse... The Going Public Phase is when they're audidnce didn't really buy what they are going for. I didn't catch it here in this album, but it is a very good album but not as good Step up to the Microphone, if you're a diehard Newsboys fan I'd think about it before buying it. It is a little to mellow for me, PLEASE NEWSBOYS, SOME A LITTLE MORE ROCKING! But the lyrics are cool in LLD they are feel good and simple"
2,"Bring back Steve Taylor, Please!","Sadly, this albumn is not up to the standard of ""Take me to your leader"" or ""Going Public."" The instrumentation is fine, and there's an infectious vibe, but the lyrics don't hit the same mark as some of their older stuff. There's not one track on here that's as good as ""Lost the Plot"" ""When you called my Name"" or ""Be Still."" I know the 'boys' want to have success on their own, but their lyrics were alot better when Steve Taylor was helping them out.If you like the Newsboys, you'll probably be ok with this albumn, but if you're looking for a first albumn to try, stick with ""Take me to your leader."""
1,Not today!,"For a band with as much talent as the Newsboys I was expecting more than a funky disco beat and wierdly mixed tunes. The direction the Newsboys have gone with this CD stinks. I can apreciate good effort but this music does not turn me on. I've just discovered the Newsboys a while ago and got hooked on Step Up To The Microphone, but this was a flop. If any of the Newsboys read this GO BACK TO THE GOOD STUFF YOU WERE WRITING BEFORE!"
1,don't bother,"why buy this cd when i'd be happy to give you the one i have. don't get me wrong, i like the newsboys; but this is nasty!"
4,Worth checking out,"Love Liberty Disco is viewed by many people as a disappointment, and by the Newsboys standards, it is. However, by normal standards, it still stands as an above-average CD. The main weakness with LLD is its glut of slow songs, many of which seem to run together. The upbeat tracks, songs like ""Good Stuff"", ""Say You Need Love"", and the title song, fare much better. Also, the opener, ""Beautiful Sound"", is indeed a beautful sound. Overall, an album worth checking out."
2,Sorry but no.,"I am really disappointed with this cd.I bought step up to the Microphone and loved it,so naturally thought i would like this one,but they got too mellow and I just can't get into the songs.granted it does have some good songs(i.e. the title song,Beautiful sound,and good stuff) but it really is not worth buying unless you do not mind buying a cd for 3 songs."
2,"A quick, ""Okay"" read.","While I may get tired of Rebus' drinking and angst, Skinner is so perfect as to be annoying. He is tall, lean, attractive, smart, an excellent shot and at hand-to-hand combat, well liked by his superior and subordinates, and has a perfect wife and baby. He easily gets the cooperation of other police agencies and bad guys tell him everything. It all gets to be a bit much. So why do I keep reading the series? Because under all that is a decent procedural with just enough suspense to keep me going. It's a quick, okay read."
5,The Cathedrals saved the best for last,"The Cathedrals once again give a fantastic performance. Most of the songs on ""A Farewell Celebration"" will be well know to Cathedral fans,but what stunning renditions they are! The passion and energy from this live performance is incredible but the one factor that as always set the Cathedrals apart from most other groups is that they are real. They truly love the Lord whom they sing about. Farewell Cathedrals. We will miss you very, very much."
5,Music from Heaven,Feel Good Music! Awe Inspriring! Heaven's Music! Best Gospel Album Ever! I have just placed an order for two addtional CD's for Christmas!! Purchasing this CD will NOT be a mistake.
5,It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This!,"What can I say more than that? George and Glen got better every year! Now that the Cathedrals no longer are a Quartet (since the death of Glen), You will really want this one! My only regret about this CD, is it has some folks singing on it that I would rather it didn't. Such as the Oak Ridge Boys, Sandi Patty, and Guy Pinrod. Personally these are not some of my favorite people, and I could have done without them being on it. The great thing is though... You can just skip through their songs, and get to the good ones. The best, ""Wonderful Grace Of Jesus."""
4,A Truly Lonely Soul,"volume 1 of Kikaider introduces you to a humanoid android named Jiro. Who is the only robot to have been blessed and cursed with a Gemini circuit. which allows him to be the only machine capable of emotion, as well as a conscience. Soon after his activation Jiro is struggling with the effects of the Gemini circuit, as well as fending off attacks from an unknown source. By the last episode in Vol. 1 of this heartfelt series, you begin to realize Jiro isn't suffering from a malfunction in his Gemini circuit.But that he's truly just a child seeing the harsh realities of this world, for the first time.

Alone and scared he's forced to find a way to survive in this strange new world."
5,"Meet Kikaider, an android built to not take orders!","I watch this show on adult swim and Inuyasha, but they took both off, in the replacements of Big O and FLCL and Blue Gender, But Kikaider is art, Dr. Komiyoji was inside his lab creating Jiro, the only android he has with a concience circuit to make him like a human, which is his ultimate goal when he meets Mitzko and Masaru, poor kikaider runs and being called a monster, but he fights in his kikaider form, he goes on adventures with everyone to find out what it is like to be human. But then at the last episode Jiro fights Gill and then finds out, that no matter how hard he tries, Jiro can never be human, so he runs away leaving Mitzko and Masaru leaving them his guitar!"
5,Great,Great product. Works exactly as advertized. This is a high quality device an every kitchen should have one. Search no further.
1,Three of us could NOT figure it out,"OK, so maybe it's broken, but we had 3 generations of very smart people trying to get a reading on this thing, to no avail. Couldn't get it to program the meat to the desired temperature, couldn't make it stop flashing crazy numbers once the probe was inserted. Trash."
3,The jury is still out...,"We definitely like the ability to choose what kind of meat you are cooking... Much easier than guessing what temperature is needed. That being said, we were disappointed at our first attempt using it as it gave us a wrong reading. We removed it and ended up using the clock instead. We'll give it another try..."
4,Polder instruments,"All of the Polder products have been of good quality and have functioned without a hitch. Nice that this has 2 probes, more useful than I thought it was going to be. The only issue that I have with this unit is the beeper or tone. It's not that I find it annoying or anything, but the beep that comes out of it is exactly the same beep as my dogs invisible fence collar. So whenever I set it, or it goes off, the dog goes nutty because she thinks that she's about to get shocked. It was kind of funny the first two times, but after that I can't help but feel sorry for the poor thing. Good product though."
1,"Don't buy this, you'll be sorry","I can't say I wasn't warned, but decided to ignore the reviews. Mine didn't work correctly out of the box. With both probes placed into the same glass of ice water I read 39 degrees on one probe and 59 degrees on the other. Switching the probes reviles that the same readings for the same inputs so the problem seems to be in the main unit and not the probes.I experienced the same kind of readings when in actual use (which is what made me do the ice water test). A pork roast in the oven for 10 minutes registered as done with a reading of 180 degrees internal, this of course is absurd.Don't buy one of these things."
1,Poor quality - broke the second time used,"It looked interesting in the ability of monitor two things at once, but the probes are very low quality. The first broke the second time I used and the second one is already behaving erratically. Very thin wire, not durable, not appropriate for such use. Look for one with a nice probe with a wire mesh shield on the wires - one like that lasted 8 yrs. This one didn't make 8 weeks. Never Polder again."
3,Polder,Tried it for the first time Thanksgiving 2011. One probe died shortly after plugging it in (Code HH displayed). Luckily the other probe worked (for now). Used it only once so far so cannot comment on longevity of probes.
2,Faulty Probe right out of the box,"I used the THM-360 for the perfect pork tenderloin and then a beef rib roast. However, one of the probes did not work right out of the package. It read HH. I have contacted Polder and NO REPLY. The warranty states probes are not covered. There you go. Buy the THM-360 and you have half the device works well and the other not at all. Amazon helped me with a new replacement. One of the probes on the second one stopped working on the first cooking as well. Frustrating! You make the judgement."
3,"Indispensable tool, fragile probes","If you cook meat, you need a thermometer like this one. Turn off the barbeque and/or smoker. Buy one.I've tried the wireless models, and they're great but unreliable in our setting - some RF source appears to mess them up from time to time. I bough this one to have a failsafe.My only complaint with this particular model is that the probes are a bit fragile. One probe failed almost immediately due to heat damage at the point where the cable enters the sheath, and there's no stress relief to avoid the obvious threat of damage due to flexing.I added a heat shrink sleeve to protect the cable/sheath transition, and the second probe is doing well after a year of steady use."
1,Read the fine print,"This probe cannot be used with an outdoor smoker or grill. It's in the fine print at the end of the instructions. Didn't see it in the description of the product and some how I missed it in the reviews. I must do a better job at my due diligence to avoid wastes of money like this was. Pass on it if you are into BBQ it will not ""meat"" your needs."
5,Excellent Meat Cooking Thermometer,"Cooked my pork tenderloin loaf to perfection using both probes, one in each side of the tied-together tenderloin strips. At first I was a little apprehensive about closing the oven door on the wires, but it worked as advertised, no problem (just keep the temp at 392F or below as per the instructions). This device surely beats the heck out of those stick-in instant temperature probes that require opening the oven door and dragging the meat out. With the Polder THM-360, you open the oven door when the dish is done (and/or for basting of course)."
2,"Good thermometer, bad probes",I've bought two of these thermometers now. I've never had a problem with the thermometer itself but the probes fail pretty easily. They either cause the display to read HH or they display the incorrect temp. Maybe Polder should sell replacement probes.
1,Terrible Product,Does not work well with the grill. Gave very accurate readings until the stainless steel probe heats up and now it does not work. Not happy with the product.
5,Polder Probe Thermometer Review,Ordered this product from Amazon & pleased with purchase. Item arrived on time as always & works very good. Can be used as an instant probe or used constantly while in over. Item still works after a year & is accurate.
4,Great Product,Two probes makes cooking two items a snap. Easily programmable. Received great reviews in well known review magazine. Glad I finally found it and purchased it
1,Junk,This item was junk. I followed the directions precisely and it would not work. I got so pissed off I threw it in the trash.I suggest it be deleted from your inventory
2,Don't get it hot,I just have trouble believing that you can't use a meat thermometer in the grill or get it hot
2,Hmmmm.....,"When I got THM 360 one of the probes didn't work..I emailed the supplier and they gave me a full refund and told me to keep it. I used it for thanksgiving on the turkey and it seemed to work ok..although I got a error mssg. some of the time. It seems as though the probes are subject to failure. I want to get the maverick upgrade with shielded cables.Also on the directions it makes note not to use this product on a bbq, which is why I got it in the first place!"
2,Broken within a year,"--Updated Review--Maybe I was just being greedy for the price. . . my initial review of this thermometer was good, but since my last review the unit has stopped working. First one side would give back odd readings, then the other stopped working all together, and soon the whole thing was a mess.If you want something you can throw away after a few months, the price is ok for this. If you want to buy the best thermometer you've ever had, and are willing to pay for it, I would skip this and get a Splash-Proof Super-Fast Thermapen - Instant Read Thermometer.It's the only thing I use these days, and still works months later."
3,Two Cool,"My children bought this for my husband for his birthday. I was of thinking two ovens two thermometers. It is great, I do not like that it will not just tell you the temperature of the meat it tells you rare, medium or well done based on the meat. Oh well still does what he wants it to do.Revision: D"
1,No Warranty on probes,"CAUTION: My unit had been used about six times when the first probe failed. The second probe failed the next time I used it.What's more, the probe(s) ARE NOT covered by Polders warranty, and cost $17+ EACH by UPS ground (USPS postage would be 60 cents).Even worse, Polder didn't even respond to my email."
3,"Good, for a while","Noticed Amazon said I purchased three years ago as I was here looking for replacement probes. Great idea and worked fine for a while but then one probe failed and now the other with light use (and proper care). I think I'll just go with the top instant read recommended by the pros instead of investing any more into this.You'll notice a common thread in most of the reviews about the probes failing. Perhaps this is a common problem among all wire probes (not exclusive to Polder) and that is why stick probes do better, I don't know. Though I never did test the accuracy with it on ice water or boiling so I can't rate it's accuracy but the features and the large display were nice."
2,Polder dual probe failures,This thermometer worked well for a couple of months then the probes started failing. The cost of replacement probes with shipping makes it not economical. I don't know if the silicon leads is the weak point or not. I don't recommend. I will look for another manufacturer than Polder. I do like the dual probes and not having preset cooking temps.
1,Problem Probe,"I feel cheated. The probe did not work even on its first use. I placed the probe in the middle of a brisket I was grilling and within a few minutes the probe read HH. I changed probes and within a few minutes it again read HH. Nowhere in the instruction manuel did it explain what HH means, but it obviously means it doesn't work, because the probe doesn't. I will be requesting a refund."
3,Temp Probes...,"Did not realize the temp probes are not really designed for use inside my smoker... had I realized this, I would not have purchased this item. Don't know how it will work, but I am going to use the probes and see what happens."
2,Meat thermometer,Thermometer came with two probes. One was defective. Device works well & very accurate. Apprehensive about the defective probe so I ordered a back up from Amazon & paid for it to avoid refund hassle.
1,Failed on first use with a grill,"Not much too say. The unit was working but both probes failed, probably from heat, the first time I used it. Apparently the probes cannot take the heat of a grill. I notice that Polder replacement probes are metal sheathed, while these appear to be a high temp plastic, but not teflon. Unfortunately, this unit is not compatible with the replacement probes. Dissappointing at best. It may have worked okay with an oven at lower temperatures."
4,Still has it.,She can still still give the listener the chills with her gravelly voice and romantic and often sad lyrics.Would love to see (hear) her in person.
5,misternick-awesome!,"At last I have obtained a copy. It's taken years but is well worth the wait! I keep playing it over and over and it continues to grow on me! Surely one of her very best! I have all her albums from St Vincent's Court to View From The House and after this long absence of new material I did not know what to expect.I was astounded! As I said, probably her best one yet."
4,A good old fashioned horror story!,"Although The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward is one of the few old-fashioned horror books I have read, I found it quite interesting. The plot isn't as far-fetched as so many plots of modern-day horror stories are, but it's still fiction. The horror/action doesn't unfold too early in the story, but when it does you won't stop reading. The descriptions, in the book, of different regions are so clear and imaginable you will be able to draw pictures and design maps. The ending is unique, almost predictable, that's what makes you want to hurry-up and finish the book. Another thing I like about the book is the use of language. I think it goes perfect with the setting even though I had to read some lines over in order to understand them. To write this book in modern-day language would set it apart from other horror stories in that it wouldn't be as good."
2,"It's not a horror novel, it's a horrible novel!","Although Lovecraft's book is interesting when read as a psychyatrical case study, it lacks even the most basic elements of the horror genre. The fact that there is no central character with which one can associate and sympathise is one of the worst features of The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward for it prevents the reader from being involved in the story (something that the horror novel needs to do to captivate the reader).Still, I believe that this book is worth reading (127 quick pages). But it's a shame that Lovecraft did not have a litterary skill that matched his spectacular imagination."
2,Needs Editing,"This looked like a great book when I grabbed it off the shelf at the store, but the solutions are full of errors. Problems 1,2 and 45 have errors that I made notes of, and I know there were others as well. I got so frustrated with the amount of errors that I stopped reading it. It would be a great book if someone would go back and edit it."
4,"BlackBerry Lambskin Leather Swivel Holster for BlackBerry 8100, 8110, 8120, 8130","My old swivel Holster broke after 2 years of use. I looked high and low in stores for a replacement that would work with my blackberry. Not all holsters will put the blackberry to sleep when you holster it. Thanks to Amazon.com I found this one and it works well. The onle thing that the metal name bracket (Blackberry) fell off of it, still does not look bad but works as it should. I would buy another one if this one wears out in two years."
5,Perfect for my Nokia,"My company has provided a Nokia 6030 for several years. This holster is ideal for three reasons. Well, okay, FOUR if you include the fact that it fits perfectly. It holds it securely regardless of the activity I'm engaged in. It doesn't break the first time I squeeze into a tight place. And the magnetic flap allows for an easy one-handed quick draw while holding on to, say, a ladder with the other hand. It's perfect for my needs."
3,Pearl Holster,"It was between this and one of those non-clip on sleeves. I chose this because I've already got enough things in my pockets and am used to being one of those geeks who wears his phone on his belt anyway. I picked real RIM/Blackberry brand for the sleep mode function. Maybe other after market cases do that too, I dunno. Anyhow, I like the functionality of the case. Side opening allows charging phone while in case. The only problem I have is the back of the clip is kinda high and needs adjustment sometimes when I'm sitting to avoid digging into my side. The Amazon price was good tho."
4,great while it lasted,"It kept my Motorola Krave out of my pocket where it couldn't be scratched by stray change and/or tools. The leather was supple and the felt-like lining protected the clear screen.And then one day, I struck my hip against a handrail and the clip broke off. :["
1,Still waiting,Still waiting on this product since I ordered it on January 1 2010 (3-5 days shipping)
4,"Worked great, while it lasted","For the price RadioShack wanted to charge me for an adapter, I got this, an automobile adapter and an AC adapter for my BlackBerry Pearl 8100, and a couple of other odds and ends from Amazon. Not to mention, everything is official BlackBerry branded.The holster worked great, and the BlackBerry somehow knows when it is in there and shuts off the screen and changes ringtones if they are set to do so. I set them to be louder so I can still hear them when the phone is stuffed away.The only problem I had with it is I kept catching on things when I sit down or walk by. Eventually, the plastic belt clip broke off. There is a pin that holds the two pieces together, and the rings that hold it together eventually gave in and snapped. I would definitely buy another one of the same, and try to be more mindful of it, but I'll be upgrading my phone soon."
5,I love these cases,This is the 3rd one I've owned. They are great. Works with the phone for auto shut-off. good quality.
2,loved it for 3 weeks,i loved the holster for three weeks then the rivets snapped off of it getting into a friends car. other than the fact it lasted three weeks i liked it
4,case,it's a good deal. It broke the second day I had it. it got caught while sitting down and the swivel piece snapped right off. Kinda Lame.
4,Decent Customer Service,They replaced a holster that broke right after I opened it. They would have gotten a 5 star and raving reviews but it took much longer than it should have.
3,I just ordered a 2nd one.,"This holster does what it's supposed to do. Although, I wish there was a non-swivel model that features a slimmer belt clip. This one is just bulky enough to be a bit uncomfortable. Anyway, I'm purchasing the second one because after about a year, the clip on the first one finally broke off. Not a huge deal. Sometimes I spend more on a cup of coffee."
1,Fails to keep the phone off,"The holster is supposed to demagnetize the keyboard so the phone stays off. Does not happen.Instead, if the phone is on before inserted, it stays on and if it is off, it is turned on by the holster, and stays on inside. It might be a design problem with Pearl as well, since the power key is very sensitive. ATT sells a similar holster (no Blackberry logo) that works great, but costs about $30 !!!"
1,I would not trust this company,"I ordered this product, but never got to try it because it was not sent to me. Instead, without permission or explanation, Amaranth FLOUR was sent to me, which months and months later I still have not used. I never ordered flour. I contacted the company by email, phone, and through Amazon customer service, but not once did they so much as reply. I would advise anyone to be very wary of ordering products from Nu World - it is questionable that you will get what you want, and they do not return customer correspondence."
1,FAKE NINJA GARBAGE,"This book is disgustingly bad and a good way to get yourself killed or arrested. This book was written during the ninja boom of the 80's by a karatedoka(note his use of the word ""koga"" people from the region of Shiga which is the modern name for that area use a different pronunciation, the ""koga"" spelling is used by people who know nothing about the area or its inhabitants) donning a fake Japenese name and black pajamas to jump on the band wagon. Not only is 99% of the info in this book inaccurate, but making weapons is a very specific skill that takes decades of training. This book exists for geographically disadvataged or lazy children who don't want to find a real ninja related school(bujinkan, genbukan,jinenkan) to live out fantasies. Save your money don't buy this book and maybe save up for a real martial arts class"
4,A Greater Understanding,"This book is very good if you want to understand what goes on in your body when you dive. It takes the form of comparative physiology; what are the adaptations that diving mammals have, which humans do not. The book is well written (not too heavy in the sciences)so that the non-science minded individual can understand it. It also has good diagrams. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a greater understanding of the effects of increasing pressure (with depth) on the various organ systems within the body."
2,Disappointing,"Poorly organized content as well as scarce and bland illustrations make this book not worth its money. In addition to following a totally unintuitive and strange organization, the information presented is superficial and, if I had to guess, 20 years outdated in many places. Also, the authors completely dropped the ball on providing references in the text, an oversight that is inexcusable in such a dynamic and ever-changing field as dive medicine. The only reason I gave two instead of one stars is that the chapters do include real-world examples of the material covered, mostly in the form of diving incidents and accidents. However, when I wanted to learn the latest and greatest about nitrogen narcosis, for example, the entry on wikipedia turned out to far outperform the chapter in this book. Personally, I would not buy this book again and don't recommend it."
5,Transition to Adult Life,"I have been a work study coordinator in Ohio for 19 years. This book outlined fresh new ideas for transition plans and gave specific guidelines for certain disabilities. I have retired and am now working again with transition in public high schools. This is similar to a college textbook. It is thorough and gives sample transition plans to examine. It does cover autism in one chapter. I highly recommend this book for special education teachers and transition specialists.Elaine Krieg Amherst, Ohio"
4,Great information,"This book is a great resource for teachers who deal with high school transition of those with special needs. It provides scenarios and lots of reference information. Even though it is very lengthy and sometimes difficult to follow (side boxes of information on page), it is useful."
2,for completists only,"Nothing here you haven't read in half a dozen other Sinatra bios. The text manages to be flat and puffy at the same time, and the font is overly large, in order to pad out what is obviously a cut-and-paste homage. Some nice pictures, mostly B&W. Still, not worth it unless you want every book ever published about FAS. I'd save my money and go buy his albums if I were you. For completists only."
3,Expected more from this one,This book was ok could have been better! You will might regret getting it at the least. Could pass on this one for sure. I didnt really like Jade in the book
5,Guardian Angel is great!,Guardian Angel / The GiftAnother fantastic read. Couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this read.
4,A pleasent read,"I can't say that this is one of Garwood's better novels, but I did enjoy it. It took me awhile to get into it, but once I did, I couldn't put it down until I was finished.I rather liked Caine and Jade. I did notice however that Jade was similar in temperment to Christina in the first book Lyon's Lady. While not exactly a bad thing, I felt that Jade couldn't have been written a little differently.Guardian Angel CAN be read on it's own, though characters introduced in Lyon's Lady are revisited in this one. I always recommend one read the books in order to see what happened BEFORE the other characters met."
5,Loved it,"This is one of my favorite books, it has mystery and romance, it instantly drew me in, I thought the charachters were well-deceloped - along with the plot.I was just interested in this book since the begining of the story, I'm easily distracted so during exams I was reading instead of studying.."
5,Guardian angel,My first Julie Garwood book and I loved it she tells a great story I could not put it down. I also love series an the next is even better.
2,Not her best book,"I LOVED Ransom, the Prize and the Gift. I never even finished this one. My bookmark is still on page 235 (out of 375) and I don't foresee myself getting to it any time soon. In fact, I have read three other books since I started this one. It just couldn't hold my attention."
2,Guarian Angel was disappointing.,I am big fan of Julie Garwwod but found this book just didn't meet up to my expectations of this author.It needed to give more background information on Jade and her fears especially of being left. I also found that Caine fell in love with Jade a little to easily as well as being fooled by her. I just expected a little better out Ms. Garwood.I will continue to read her books though because one of my all time favorites is The Wedding!
1,"Blah Blah Blah,","I couldn't even finish this novel and I love Julie Garwood books, but this one was the worst book, worst then come the spring and that's a tough act to follow."
2,"I'm a big Garwood fan, but","I found this story - and the related ""Lion's Lady"" -disappointing. And I rate them 2 stars because other Garwood books - The Wedding, Saving Grace, Gentle Warrior - are so much better than this. Part of the problem - Garwood tends to write in a very modern voice, with characters saying things that you and I would say today. Somehow, this works just fine with Scottish clans in 1100 - but it just doesn't ""click"" with Regency characters. Another problem - the non-romance plot gets muddied and rushed here, with characters thrown in to ""solve"" the mystery. The pirate plot could have been so much more successful. Both Lion's Lady and this book are very rushed at the end, trying to wrap things up. My recommendation - skip this and read Saving Grace instead!"
3,Good but not Garwood's best,"I had a difficult time getting into this book. I suppose I have been spoiled like many other JG fans by THE SECRET, RANSOM, and THE WEDDING to name a few of her 5+ star books. I have read some of her other Regency books and have not enjoyed them as much as her Medieveal books. For some reason, these books don't ""feel"" like Regency books if that makes any sense. And I have to agree with some of the other reviewers in that if you read these particular Regency books close together it is difficult to tell the characters apart (freckles across the nose, etc.). However, as I got into the story I did enjoy it. I liked Caine and Jade very much, but call me a prude, but I do get turned off a story when the characters are sleeping together before they are married. Overall, I think this is a good read, just not Ms. Garwood's best."
5,Goth music rules!,This album is the best The 69 Eyes album.Melancholic and romantic album is really goth-and-roll!Don't miss it!
2,Glow-peak Pro,"This charger worked well for about two weeks. Looks good on the outside, JUNK on the inside. The glow charger connector broke and there's no way to repair it. Save your money and buy two Ofna Glow Chargers for the same price as one of these."
4,A Great Help,"If you find yourself skipping words and phrases in articles and books that you sense everyone but you understands this is an excellent addition to your dictionary collection. After checking a number of similar reference books at the library I chose this one because it tells a little history of word/phrase usage in addition to just a translation, this allows you to put it into better context."
3,525 Playback issues,"I have mixed feelings after having purchased this DVD Combo this summer. Some DVDs play flawlessly, but others skip so badly they aren't viewable. Also, sometimes it's impossible to shut off subtitles. Even when going through the DVD menu, the subtitles will still play. You must click options on the player remote and shut it off that way. Several cases...the movie Spygame with Redford and Pitt. Skips and jumps through the hole flick, subtitles cannot be shut off at all. You can actually hear the DVD player head or something internal buzzing trying to do error correction. Transformers..first viewing was flawless. Now it skips towards the end of the movie. Last night wathced Talladega Nights, first 3/4 movie was fine. Got to last 30 minutes or so and and it started skipping. May wind up sending it in for repair. Spygame played flawlessly on my previous DVD only Panasonic."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I received this as a gift, it WILL NOT RECORD ANYTHING from my satellite receiver, says ""copy protected"" I planned on using this to record programs I could not watch becaude I was working. A dvd PLAYER would do all this product can do for a LOT less $$$."
1,a piece of junk,"I have just gotten this dvd player to replace an other of mine. Guess what???? I am taking it back. It will not play other DVD's that I have recorded on my other recorder, and oh yes they have been finalized and they will play with no problem on other dvd players. On the Sony, they will not play. One may play for a moment and then the picture will hang up and sound will stop a few seconds later. Just can't get any of the DVD's recorded to play."
1,Worst piece of junk i have ever owned,"This thing has never worked right. should have taken it back but thought maybe i wasn't doing something correctly. it only records sometimes. sometimes with a decent picture sometimes like i use rabbit ears. it tries to record on its own when i turn it on then won't respond to the remote.wont shut off until i pull the plug , just a complete piece of junk and i have lots of other sony items but i despise this waste of money and time."
1,Doesn't work as advertised,"My first test run of this item was copying an old VHS movie (out-of-print and unavailable on DVD) to DVD. I went through the process twice. Both times everything seemed to go well as far as there being no error messages displayed during the process, and everything going according to instructions. But both DVDs were blank or unreadable afterward (I tried on several DVD players, and on computers). It's going back."
1,This Machine Gives SONY a bad name!,"This is my second player with this model and it still freezes during DVD playback. Very frustrating for a machine that costs $217. As I can now see with most other customer reviews, I am not alone with this problem. Sony should at least provide for replacement of this unit with a better model since this is the second model RDR-VX525 that I've had this problem with over a 1 year period."
1,Definitely not worth the money,"I would not recommend this product. Neither of the two features I need most from this Sony -- DVD player and DVD recorder -- work.The DVD player freezes all the time and there's no way to get past that point (FF, REW, etc. nothing works). Plus, with some DVDs all of a sudden there will be this extremely loud squeal or static sound and, well, that's the end of being able to watch that DVD. I've cleaned the DVD player several times but that hasn't helped.We have been able to copy one VHS tape. Other than that we've made a lot of coasters. The instructions are terrible, but even when you finally make some sense of them the end result is more DVDs that won't play. I've tried three DVD formats (+R, -R, R/W) and have wasted many hours trying to get this thing to work.So I gave up on trying to record but the aforementioned DVD player problems keep me from using it at all. At the end of the day all I've managed to do is buy a $200 VCR."
3,Good Combo Unit for Migrating Home Movies to DVD!,"I bought this to migrate old VHS home movies to DVD. Know that the unit defaults to format Sony DVDs as video versus the DVD-RW. The one-touch record feature is nice, but you will spend multiple hours figuring out the GUI to do your projects."
1,Poor quality,"Perhaps it was just the pair I received, but the strap broke the second time I wore the shoes! Definitely disappointed."
4,Very Good!,I believe Jilly Cooper is continung to make her mark on the publishing world. If you have no understanding of the British rural landscape and the way they think then this book like her others will not make much sense. If you do then I highly recommend this book and all her others!
3,Not her best....,"Don't get me wrong...I've loved every book by Jilly Cooper set in Rutshire. This book is definately good, but it is lacking when compared to her other works (Riders, Rivals, Polo, Appasionatta). Whereas those books were exceptionally witty, had very engrossing characters, and fun plots this book frankly does not. The main character, Lysander, is just not very likeable, and the plot gets tedious.In a nutshell, if you're a fan this book is a must. If you're not, read her other books first...but then you'll want it anyway so you might as well just buy it."
3,"If you are a Jilly virgin, don't read this one first...","I agree with the reader from Minnesota - this is pretty good, and you can definitely read it without falling asleep. But it is by no means a fair reflection of Cooper's Rutminster collection...Riders, Rivals, Polo, Appassionata and Score! are all far, far superior with much more intriguing heroines, heroes and principal characters.Read the books in this order: Riders, Rivals, Polo, Appash, Score! and THEN the Man Who...Otherwise, you may not bother with another Jilly...and that's like a child being deprived of Roald Dahl!"
2,painful to read,I may try again with this book but right now I cannot do it. It is so stilted and really corny. Just not the thinking woman's book. I removed it from my kindle carousel. I will read when desperate. Sorry. Should have read sample but reviews seemed good. (Richards wife)
4,Simply fascinating,"I have read several books before regarding NDEs and the subject is always truly astounding. Moody gives examples from many different people who have experienced NDEs. This book makes a believer out of me that there is life after life on earth. Moody doesn't try to sell his viewpoint - he simply presents the facts as they were presented to him. He doesn't try to sell the phenomena as brains deprived of oxygen; he doesn't try to sell any scientific reasons as to what really happens. He lets the peoples stories speak for themselves. If you know someone who is a non-believer in the hereafter (and may be dying), this book should make them less afraid of death."
3,"Old News, Maybe?","This seemed a bit bland or maybe my expectations were set too high. Today we hear so much of this same information that maybe it is just ""old news"". Yes, there are some good points within the reading, but yet, wouldn't recommend as a purchase. Can't even really make conversation regarding the contents after this read."
3,Life after life,"I found this book good, but it was not what I expected. What I disliked was the short excerpts of the accounts. I was hoping for more full length detailed accounts, and this book only tells about a paragraph of each experience. I think it needs more elaboration, it was much too brief. The other thing I disliked was the writing style. The author often uses the same words repeating, for instince: had had, etc. This book is neither exceptional or bad in my opinion."
5,Important and captivating,"No matter what your personal views are on religion, spirituality, or death, Life After Life is an important book because it is the first of its kind--no one had given the near death experience, or NDE, the scientific time of day until Moody came along. He stays grounded throughout the book, simply describing actual NDEs and tying together the common elements between them without making too much of a statement of opinion. (Incidentally, the follow up book The Light Beyond sees Moody start to go off the deep end and explore pseudoscientific topics such as ""mirror gazing,"" something that is clearly explained by other scientific phenomena, though it also has more legit NDE information.)I am a person who is fascinated by the very real experience of NDE whether it's indicative of an afterlife or the complexities of our own brain. If you share that interest (or think you might), this is the definitive book to start with. Overall an easy, enjoyable read that is highly recommended."
4,Life After Life,"Great Book! Lots of good information on an interesting subject. This book not only answers inportant questions about life, but it made me formulate new questions? This book really helped me see the world in a new light. It's quite thought provoking."
4,A entertaining view on afterlife,"This book Life After Life was about peoples experiences of dieing and entering the afterlife. This book i would suggest you read it if you are intrested in the afterlife or have any fears or doubts about dieing. it really helps you realize that dieing is not the worst part of death. It is the anticipation of dieing that is the worst. This book sucked me in from the beggining but lost me every once and a while. So if you think you can stick through this story without geting to lost like i did, i really suggest you read this book. It is not to long and not to hard to read. hank you for reading my review and taking my advice on the book titled Life After Life"
3,Nothing Near About A Near Death Experience,"I read quite a few books about NDEs before I bought this one. No doubt it was very controversial when it was originally published. Dr. Moody does a very good job of compiling and comparing data from interviews with the people who had these experiences to capture the ""essence"" of dying and how it changed their perspective on life. This is definitely what he does best. The part to support NDEs through sources like the Tibetan Book of the Dead and the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg was lacking. But in his defense, it had to be put in there or the book would have been classifed under fiction."
4,Good Transaction...!,"The book was delivered on time. The book was in the shape I expected, which was ""used but in good shape"". The only thing was that the book didn't have the same cover design that was shown in the picture. It was the same book, but it must be a different edition?"
3,An in-depth look into death and dying...,"I find the book somewhat interesting...Very scientific and interesting--especially since he used to be a skeptic of these experiences!The rules of the universe are based on spiritual rules--which explains why the rules of the universe can be unpredictable!Proof?Science has come up with a very interesting proposition--that the earth has FOUR dimensions, not just three! Of course, Science can't prove this because you can't prove this unpredictable fourth dimension by Science--only by proving a higher set of rules exists!And you can't prove that a higher set of rules exists, because science is predictable!Anyways...overall, it's an interesting read!"
1,Agitating,"I found this book to be an ignorant one-sided look at the near-death experience phenomena. I have no argument with the fact that it happens, or that many people have this take on the issue. However, the author shot down every other possible logical explanation with hearsay, exaggeration, and tried to cover up his lack of knowledge on the scientific aspect with sequipedalianism."
4,"this book started ""near Death"" awareness",I first read the original book in 1975 and found to open my eyes about what life is all about. I just re-read the bookto review what I learned in 1975 and to reinforce my personal faith.
4,life after life book,book came as described. This is an interesting book. Gives new perspectives on death.
4,Good content,Gives accounts from persons that have had a near death experience and also discusses the notion of life after death. Helpful if you have recently lost someone or just interested in the topic. I would recommend to others.
3,Life After Life,"Interesting but could be more involved in each experience. The experiences should be more in depth and thought provoking. I couldn't get ""into"" reading it because I wanted more information about each story being shared."
1,Hallucination-the word of the day,As someone who had an NDE I wish Moody would have interviewed me. I was racing on my motorcycle and flew over the handlebars and landed on my head to which I was unaware of my surroundings and a fellow rider picked me up and got me to stagger home. I do not remember anything for the estimated 20 minutes after the crash except waking up. To think you had an experience otherwise is a hallucination or the mind being deprived of a sufficient level of oxygen.
3,"Informational, but defensive.","This book is considered by many to be the authority on the topic of Near Death Experiences. It is very scientific in nature, but I found it to be monotonous because of its droning defense of the author's work. It doesn't so much focus on the NDE itself as much as the author's scientific approach to the topic. It has case studies that are highly susceptible to outside influences and hazy memories (as most stories are being told many years after the event happened), but at the time it was the only book on the market. It is still hard to find much literature on this subject, so it is a valuable read, but it would be quite easy for an author in today's world to write a current and more accurate work if someone had the opportunity."
4,An interesting study,"I read the original version a long time ago. My life has gone a very different direction due to the content. I have learned the content is true, and there is much more. The updated version reconfirmed that which I have learned. A very good read."
5,Life After Life.,"I enjoy this book. I definitely believe there is life After this life in the world as we know it. I would recommend this book if you have an open mind about Life after your Life here on earth. Or even if you think there might be a life after your earthly life. I like this book so much that I sent my sister -in-Law the book too. She called me several weeks ago and said she was thrilled with the book. I have read the whole book. But, I often get it out and read it again. Thank-You so much for an uplifting thoughtful written book. I congratulate the author Raymond A. Moody, JR, M.D. for his well written book."
2,Not the Renassance I was looking for,"Despite being listed on Amazon under ""Annie Haslam"", this album does not feature her at all, and although most of the songs are perfectly adequate covers of Renaissance songs, it was just not the same without Annie Haslam's range of lyrical expression and phenomenal ability to hold a sustained note."
2,There are better choices,"I found out that it doesn't create SVCDs. Also, the video editing is quite limiting, not even as good as the free Windows MovieMaker 2, or Ulead VideoStudio. Finally, the text on the product tour dialog doesn't show on my Windows XP machine. So my advice is: Look somewhere else for video editing software. This one is not worth it."
2,Resource HOG! Very Tempermental Software,This thing eats up resources like you cannot imagine. You MUST have at least 512mb of RAM in your system and at least an 833 mhz processor to even think about successfully running this software. The software is buggy--which is probably why Roxio has an upgrade available on its website. Make sure you download the upgrade before you try to run with this.Having said all that--once you figure out how to work with it...it does make some nice movies. But...you won't get any movies without frustration first.One more note: documentation is thin and tech support is virtually nonexistent. Roxio charges for phone tech support and provides only limited email tech support. They take forever to respond to emails. There is some useful information from other users available on their website bulletin board area.Still--not bad software if you can get it for free after rebate.
2,A lot of time with little to show for it,I was very disappointed with this software after reading other reviews. First it is limited to story line editing only. There is no real movie time line editing in the package. You can do individual segments but not the movie. Very little capabilities in audio tracks plus it often generates errors here using audio tracks over the entire movie instead of just a section of time specified. The worst part-it would not create a DVD unless I upgraded (separate purchase) my easy CD creater software (this came from technical assistance). Technical assistance is a joke from website to phone system. The only real saving grace is the ability to strip audio from an individual clip.
4,Not bad for beginners,"Was in an hurry to get some software to put a video presentation together for a rehearsal dinner...Roxio Videowave has worked pretty well so far. Most of my media is still digital photos, but I incorporated both stills and video into the presentation. Saved it pretty easily into an MPEG file, and it's worked well so far. User's manual could be a little better, Help menu is okay for beginners. Overall, a good product. It has met my expectations, but just whetted my apetite to do more! There's a rebate available - use it to make this quite affordable."
4,Easy to use and supports a lot of formats,"Not as good as Ulead Studio6 but there is not much left you can ask to this easy, not very expensive and polyfunctional program. It allows you to rip your existents DVDs, convert them into .avi extension, and viceversa, so... you can imagen what you can build if you add to all this the capablity of reading and writing .dvix format as well. support all kind of mediums, DVD, SVCD, VCD, DVD-R and plus etc.Only thing a beginer like me is missig is the wizard, but if you know a little about video editing you wont need it"
1,Roxio Videowave movie creator,"It has a nice user interface - too bad it doesn't work! It crashed several times on installation. I called tech support and they gave me a couple of suggestions. Those didn't work either. The technician said he would send me email with more suggestions. So far I have not received the email. Called tech support a second time. A different tech discovered that there is a Microsoft .DLL file that is buggy. He told me where to get a fixed .DLL off the web from Microsoft. This time it did install successfully. Everything went fine until I got to the part where it burns a CD. The program crashed there. I tried is several more times using different CD write speeds from 2X to 12X. They ALL crashed. I suppose it really doesn't matter, but this is the slowest writing CD software I have ever seen. (Doesn't matter because it didn't finish anyway.)"
2,Hard to install,"Bought the software in 1-9-03 and submitted rebate. Guess what, no rebate check yet. Think twice before you purchase.Tried to install into my PC twice but couldn't."
1,Terrible Product for Beginner OR Advanced Users,"what can I say...this product does not work, comes with lousy directions, and customer support makes you PAY to answer your questions. I can't believe they released this junk. Please stay as far away as possible, and don't say I didn't warn you."
1,Don't Buy. Poor.,"Received this program as part of a Dell package. Software worked adequately for simple music videos. I also made several ""slide shows"" using pictures and audio. Unfortunately after a few weeks the program quit working completely. Uninstalling and reinstalling did not help and customer support is non-existant. Don't buy."
1,Poor Choice - Pure and Simple,"Too many limitations and a confusing interface make for a poor choice. Thankfuly, it was a ""freebie"" for me with Roxio Media Creator.I'm investing $50 in Wondershare Movie Story - I tried it our for a 30 day free trial and LOVE it. Absolutely wonderful and gives so many creative options, transitions, etc. Don't fool with the (now) dinosaur Videowave."
3,Has problems editting captures,"I bought this product to edit my captured TV shows and remove the commercials. It appears to work fine and is easy to learn but when I played the final product, I found a problem.After I edit something in the capture, the sound will be off by a half second or so. Researching the problem it has been around for many versions of this product with still no solution. I have tried recommended changes to my system and settings but still no luck.Your mileage my vary, but if you plan on using this to edit TV captures, look for another product. Or at least, see if you can try a demo of this first."
3,Good one for Beginners,"First time using a Software like this. Easy to use interface. And easily create movies using automatic wizard. Also available manual creation of movies for advanced users who would like to design how their mopvies should look. Good collection of transitions and other stuff. Had some initial trouble during setup. But reinstallation helped.Cannot award 5 stars as this is not ideal. The software does not detect already encoded video and tries to encode it again. Good software for beginners and not so advanced for professionals. Got this free after rebate , so no complains."
1,Does not work with new Sony camcorders,I bought this software with the hopes of editing some software using my Sony DCR-IP5. Sofware cannot capture video. Called the company for support . . but you will be listening to a looped recording for 5 minutes.. . nothing in their website of much value. . . and if you must talk to a person . . you have to pay $20. It may be nice software . . . but I suggest looking around for comparable products with BETTER SUPPORT.
1,VideoWave Movie Creator - A Major Disappointment,"I purchased this product with the intent of converting old VHS family movies to DVD. I found this product to be very difficukt to work with even tho I have an excellent computer. Specifically this product runs very slow, caused my home network to crash repeatedly, does not allow you to insert chapters, instead requiring the making of individual movies. It required three DVD disks ($$) to copy one full VHS tape of 2hrs and 15 min.Avoid this product even if it comes with rebates and discounts."
1,Beware,"If you think you're going to get the original hits of the Tremeloes from the 1960s, think again. This CD is a 1988 re-recording of their greatest hits, in every way inferior to the music you heard on the radio decades ago. Unless you're a completist, you'd best avoid this one. You'll be disappointed."
5,Nice Driver!,"I played golf constantly as a young man, and had a single digit handicap. Then I quit playing and didn't pick up a club for 30 years. I recently took up the game again, and have found some amazing improvements in equipment. This is one of them. Easy to play and consistent, this club chopped strokes off my score. It's hard not to like! I am playing the whole set of Perfect Clubs."
5,He loves it!!,My boyfriend loves his new driver. He really likes the shots he's able to make with it and loves the weight and feel.
3,Zemsky collecter,"I am not an artist, just a collecter of Jessica Zemsky's paintings. I bought the book to have on the coffee table, several of my paintings are in her illustrations. It is a fine book for my purpose."
2,Need Garter belt!!!,"The stockings were very nice but there was no way to keep them up, and they were too short . I looked EVERYWHERE for garter belt ot girdle, so if you don't have one already you will need to order one on-line (good luck), or choose stockings with the elastic band to keep them up."
4,Good bag,"The bag is large enough for all my tools, plus my cordless drill. Only one zippered pocket though. I would like to see more zippered pockets, and deeper outside pockets. It's large, tough and durable. I've had it for about 6 months now."
4,TOOLBAG,I just needed a large enough toolbag to accomodate the hammer that I have. It also helps that I can now close it.
5,bomb proof,"The Stanley 12-inch tool bag is my grab-and-go favorite for quick home repairs; so I looked to Stanley for a big bomb-proof bag to serve as an all-purpose bugout bag, shooting bag, roadside emergency bag, gear bag -- whatever its use, its waterproof bottom, tough fabric, strong zippers, and well-organized pockets make this bag the perfect choice for bigger loads. Plus it is an excellent value!"
3,Just OK,"This bag does not appear to be very sturdy. The canvas is fairly thin, and it doesn't look like something that's built to last. The biggest negative, however, is how the bag falls over on itself. It is too flimsy to stay open unless you're holding it open, which makes digging around inside for the right tool more difficult than it should be. I didn't find the pockets or their location particularly useful. More pockets would have been a plus."
4,It's great!,Well Carlos has had some better albums but Shamon is probablybetter than his 1970 album Abraxes.I really like the song America with P.O.D.I think it should have a couple nominees for the grammy's.I also think he should make a new album.I think that if any song made it to the grammy's it would beGame of love with Michelle Branch.
5,Consistently Carlos!,"Combine Carlos Santana's integrity, history, style, and virtuosity with the energy and ideas of new, young artists, and the result is magical and downright heartwarming. As with Supernatural, myriad rhythms and styles are represented here, all lovingly blanketed in Santana's familiar brilliance. But don't expect to hear ""Supernatural II."" Each track is unlike anything you've heard before. Carlos generously marries his musical vision with that of folks like Placido Domingo and Chad Kroeger, and we get to share in that vision. Lock yourself away, slap on some headphones, and listen to the whole thing 3 or 4 times in a row. You'll get it."
5,Santana Does It Again,"Ok, i know that Santana's turn to a more pop sound hasnt sat wellwith a lot of his die hard fans but it has brought him new ones..myself included. whatever you musical taste is, it is covered on this cd.....and whats interesting is that Santana does well with all his musical guest.....its doesnt matter if he is chillin with Musiq or rockin with POD....ALL THE SONGS ARE GOOD. and eventhough i hate to say it, i even like the Macy Gray song.so if you are a music fan who's taste knows no bounds, this is the cd for you......ONELOVE!"
2,"A dissapointment after ""Supernatural""","I bought this album solely on hearing the Michelle Branch contribution. Other than that song, and track #6 and #10, this album is largely a walk-through for Carlos Santana.And what's up with Placido Domingo?? I can't help but get the feeling that Santana's ego is starting to get the better of him. If I hear one more contributor to a Santana album sing ""Caaarloooos SaaaaanTANA,"" I'm going to cut the disk in half. Lyrics shouldn't be about the performer allowing others to idolize him, should they? Maybe I'm just senstive that way.I've tried hard to like it. I just can't. It's not horrible. But it's close."
3,Carlos hits it again....,"Well all I can say is that if you are a fan of Santana you will like this album, its lone shortcoming is that theres not enough Carlos on this album, but more of guests. All in all, you WONT regret buying this CD."
5,"Fantastic, make this one for the cd collection","This CD is brilliant, the first song the game of love is excellent, and the rest of the tracks are the same, this CD is on repeat in my cd player, crank it up loud and listen to the master of guitar. The vocals are excellent to, Michelle Branch and dido are just awesome."
2,What a Sham?,"It's sad that a wonderful guitarist / songwriter like Carlos Santana could put out ANOTHER one of these recordings. I was bored by the third song and had to look at the top of the CD to make sure that I didn't mistakenly put Supernatural in the player. Carlos jumped the shark with that last one and now it has turned into a monster that won't die. Please go back to the way it was, Carlos, PLEASE! Those who liked Supernatural will probably like this one and it will enjoy commercial success. As far as I can tell, the band is gearing up for retirement!"
2,worst santana,"Don't bother buying this cd. Spend your money on some real Santana cd's like Barboletta, Caravanserai, Oneness and anything with Gregg Rolie. Carlos has been recording since 69' he should now what his audience likes. Personally I dont want to hear one of my favorite ""rock"" guitar players playing with a bunch of rappers who probably never even heard of Santana before Supernatural...only two highlights ""the victory is won"" and ""Sideways"""
4,"""Victory is Won"".worth the price","This CD is not even close to the phenominal ""Supernatural"", however, ""Victory is Won"" is worth buying this one. It really helps to illustrate the brillance of Santana. Like an earlier review stated, this CD could have been a lot better if Carlos had focused on who ""he"" really is and not on what others think he should be. Also, while there are some talented artist included in this CD, it does fall short of ""Supernatural"". However, this CD still has it's bright spot and won't be a waste of your money."
2,"Santana , the band and Man, too talented for Shaman","The Shaman must understand the oneness of the mundane and spiritual. Santana has understood and passed this understanding to us with partners such as John Mclaughlin and Alice Coltrane and maintained the integrity of his art. His more popular music efforts have still shown this understanding, just check out his first three albums and many others.Santana, both the band and the Man are just too great musicians to give us this watered down pop. There are thousands of musicians who can do this pop, but only one Santana. It is time Santana listens to his art and not the music business.Viva Santana!"
2,Low Point,"Santana is one of the greatest living guitarists and this is one of his worst albums. Santana's great talent is completely lost in a limp mix of forgettable pop tunes. I can appreciate the desire to reach a larger audience and continue his well deserved success but playing background guitar licks over a cattle call of second rate pop stars will not further his artistic vision or win him any long term fans. I think after two pop albums, Santana's diehard fans deserve a great album in the spirit of Abraxis. Sorry Carlos."
2,Has anybody seen or heard from Santana?,"I'm sorry but Sanatana's lost his way. I guess his record company dictates what songs he records and who records with him. Concerning his collaborations on these songs, it seems more like he's trying to mix water with oil and it just ain't happen'n folks. Better luck next time, maybe this great talent will get back on track. I sure hope so, otherwise he'll just fade away. Come on man, play from the heart.Pancho Rodriguez"
2,No Supernatural,"Unfortunately, Supernatual is easily one the best CDs ever made it is so good that Shaman is merely mediocre. Adouma starts offpromisingly then the cd deteriorates into drivel. Musiq, Macy Gray and Seal could have been thrown all on one track and dispensed with they were severely underutilized. The other collaborations had absolutely no edge and were not distinctive orcontemporary. Santana uses the acoustic guitar a great deal throughout the cd which is not a bad thing, but I DO see a Santana Unplugged in our future. Sideways with Citizen Cope, One of These Days with Ozomatli and Novus with Placido Domingo are the highlights of a rather disappointing set."
3,Shaman,"This album is good. What I don't like about it, is that here is a bunch of guest musicians. But, some places are good. But not all. And he doesn't play a lot of songs, which are performed without any guest musicians.Carlos Santana is a great guitarist. My favorite Santana album is Abraxas. After like a maybe sixth album, his songwriting got worse and worse. And he went a little pop. That's why he didn't get the commercial success in the 80's or something."
2,Tarnished by mediocre guests,"I always found Santana's work to be moving and was pleasantly surprised by the guest-heavy, ""Supernatural"". However, twice wasn't a charm with, ""Shaman"". Carlos' guitar work is SOLID, don't get me wrong. The downfall of this record was the guest lineup. The songs featuring Michelle Branch, Musiq, and Seal were pleasant to listen to. The rest were either poor singers OR decent singers taking part in a poor song. Macy Gray hurts my ears and Citizen Cope isn't the best there is. Chad Kroeger is a mediocre singer singing a bad song. POD's track didn't fit this forum at all. Most disappointing was Dido's contribution. She has a soothing voice, but this was an example of a singer singing a poor song. In retrospect, it may have been better for Santana to release a more traditional album, but I'm sure the label wanted to try to cash in more on ""Supernatural"". I still like you Carlos, and I look forward to your next one. I hope it's better."
1,sellout,"I can't believe Carlos Santana has to do this sort of stuff. This is a pure record company marketing ploy to sell him to a younger audience. There is nothing Shamanistic for starters about this album (listen to Soul Sacrifice and know what shamanistic is). And he has all these kids who were in Pampers when he was lighting up the stage, singing with him....I mean come ON!! Musically it is terrible. Carlos Santana you do NOT have to do this, your legacy is assured! I listen to everything, including pop and hiphop, but sorry, the few moments of decent redeeming Santana moments and maybe passable vocals on this album still do not make it worth it. It does NOT work. I live in Bangkok, Thailand. Santana is playing here on Nov 3 to promote Shaman. I would ordinarily have bought a ticket for a Santana concert without the hint of a second thought. But I am NOT going to this concert. Carlos you are selling out and you are losing the faithful. Supernatural was tolerable, but this is awful!!"
1,"Too Much Filler, Too Many Guests...","I was soooo sick of the ""Supernatural"" phenomenon that I swore I would avoid further ""New Millenium"" Santana releases, and I should have kept my word. While instrumental tracks like ""Foo Foo"" and ""Aye Aye"" are somewhat adventurous and the lead-off single ""The Game Of Love""(sung by Michelle Branch)is a sunny, sweet pop confection that deserves to be a hit, the remainder of ""Shaman"" sounds too overcrowded, manufactured and trite. While his previous LP wasn't a true Santana LP by any stretch of the imagination, this release simply tries too hard to replicate it's formula and in turn, saps all the passion and fervor out of the music. Other than an old guy in a funny hat backing up a host of new-jacks, I don't know who the real Carlos Santana is anymore. This is a very disappointing release from a legend who is just barely going throught the motions now. With regret, I must say pass on this one."
3,Why don't you and I,The CD I got featured Chad Kroeger. I was hoping for the radio version with Alex Band. Feels like Fire with Dido is really good.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This cd started with a catchy single. And that is the only decent song on the cd. i wouldn't even burn this cd for a friend. it is one of the worst choices i have made on purchasing a cd. i should have listened to the critics on this one. if you think they are being to harsh on him, they aren't its horrible. he colaborates with other artists and that takes some guts but it didn't come out like i thought it was. but when he colaborated with Michelle Branch it came out great. you may think i only like that single because there is a decent looking female in the video, that is not why. It has powerful guitar and lyrical content. all the other ones just sound plain nothing that kept me interested. i don't think it will ever be put back into my cd player, except to listen to ""The Game Of Love."""
1,Crapola! Shaman and Supernatural Are a Joke!,"Santana sold his soul. He is a complete sellout. Santana even admitted that he didn't even know who the guest vocalists were going to be or which parts they were going to sing. This is a paint by numbers CD with nothing to offer except crappy corporate pop rock. I used to be the biggest fan until these 2 sellout CDs hit the market. Santana, you are famous now. Go back to writing CDs like Milagro or Blues for Salvador."
2,Shaman is a shame,"I'm a long-time Carlos fan of 30 years and have bought everything he's released. I find myself very disappointed in this record......he sounds like a guest on his own album. It doesn't sound like he's driving the car, just riding along. Supernatural was a fine record and had it's moments, but here, it seems like they're trying to capture lightning in a bottle. Am I the only one who hears Carlos just playing these uninspired blues cliches over and over again? His playing doesn't flow as it once did, rather the notes come in spurts, and I find myself being able to predict where he's going next......hate that feeling. Here's hoping that Carlos makes another album from his heart and leaves all the guests in the Green Room."
1,"Know where the term ""sham"" came from? yep: Shaman","Could this recording title have been a clever inside joke? They're laughing all the way to the bank.Back in the 60s, visionary musicians like Hendrix, Davis and Santana transcended the established musical boundaries of their time to courageously explore new directions for jazz and rock. They ignored the business side of the recording industry to focus their energies on the music.Today, Santana seems to have completely reversed his goals. I don't hear an ounce of creative breakthrough in his new work. I hear the recording business money makers calling the shots, marketing Santana like a new pair of Nikes. And it works, he's more popular than ever, playing the least inspired work of his long career. What a sham, and a shame. Could Carlos, the guy who brought us Abraxas, Love Devotion and Surrender, and Caravanserai actually like this stuff?"
2,what a commercial album santana!,"Shaman is, unfortunatly, a commercial album that has just 3 goods tracks:The game of love, victory is won and sideways.If you want the ""real"" santana, buy the following albuns: SantanaAbraxassantana IIcaravanseraiwelcomelotusinner secretsmarathonzepobshangoblues for salvadorspirits dancing on the flash"
2,What a bunch of pretentious [baloney]!,"So, Santana is proclaiming himself a Shaman? Some kind of holy man or something? Don't be so pretentious Carlos please! I guess that those ten or so grammy awards for his last album went to his head. The only reason I give this album two stars instead of one is that Carlos is a great musician and great guitarist and he had an amazing performance at woodstock. But, this is total [baloney]! Why does he feel that he has to bring in these other artists who can only hurt his music? Supernatural was good because he chose other musicians thoughtfully, but Placido Domingo and P.O.D. on the same CD? Come on! Carlos needs to go back to writing good music with his own band instead of doing a bunch of collaborations with artists that don't deserve to collaborate with him. There is no need to make another Supernatural. And there is no need for Santana to become pop. I know Carlos could do better than this with his own band. So avoid this one."
2,Pity...,"Supernatural had an over-abundance of guest stars, and I suppose it was one of those universal unifier albums. Nobody knows how it blew up as big as it did: did it deserve a record nine Grammies? Who cares, .... Was it a good album? Not any more than any other released in 1999. So when Santana has the spotlight on him and is able to release another album in the Abraxas vein to turn people on to the wonderful music he's made in the past, he goes and released a watered-down Supernatural 2. Who's gonna respect that? I know I won't. Sorry Carlos, go back to your roots while people still know you."
3,Its ok...,"I like the POD, Michelle Branch, and Chad Kroeger songs. WHy though did Alex Band from The Calling re-sing the song for the radio? I am wondering that. The Chad version is better! Michelle Branch song is good, shes just hot too! POD is good. I just dont get the alex band singing on the radio version."
3,"Answer to who sings ""Why don't you and I""","For some reason on the radio Alex Band From ""The Calling"" sings on the track, however, On the album Chad Kroeger from ""Nickleback"" sings the track. Not sure why this is but I like the radio version better with Alex Band."
2,Save your money,"A good pop song ""game of love"" with Branch who sings with enough feeling to provide a good counter balance to Santana's guitar. None of the other collaborations are remotely memorable."
4,He did it Again!,"Its been three years since ""Supernatural"" and once agian Carlos Santana doesn't fail to astonish us. He's colaborated with todays chart-topping stars such as Michelle Branch, POD, Nickelback, and more. I especially like the track ""Amore(Sexo)"" w/ Macy Gray. Pick it up today!"
3,You can't please all the people all the time,"Good album, good tunes, but Carlos' desperation to reach out to fans of every conceivable genre (P.O.D. on the same album with Michelle Branch and Placido Domingo?) makes this CD little more than ""Now That's What I Call Music 47!"" with all tracks happening to feature Carlos Santana on guitar. The P.O.D. and Michelle Branch songs are excellent, the Chad Kroeger song is little more than a rewrite of his own band's ""How You Remind Me"", the other collaborations are interesting, but the one track that almost grinds everything to a halt is ""Foo Foo"", which points out that there are plenty of ANNOYING things about Latin music as well. This song sounds like you've been transported to the poolside dance lessons on the Lido Deck of a 65-and-over-only Carnival Cruise. I hit the skip button on my CD player every time without fail on this one."
3,Needs to do what he does best,"Although there are a few good songs on this album, for example the one with Michelle Branch, and the instrumentals, Carlos' amazing talent is being wasted. Needs more of Carlos and his incredible guitar playing, and less rap and [stuff]. Good album if you like a mixture of music, but not if you are a true Santana fan. Like the other reviewer said, go for the first three albums where Carlos uses his magic fingers."
1,Don't Plan on Making an MP3 or listening to it on a Mac,"Nothing against the CD. A few good songs. I just think if they are going to put software on a CD to interfere with ""ripping"" songs,this should be clearly disclosed. It isn't. The software to allow you to play the CD on your computer doesn't work on a Mac. On a PC it is cumbersome, and you might as well forget listening to the few good tracks on an MP3 player.This CD goes back. My vote against heavy handed copy protection"
1,Shaman is a big joke! Don't Purchase,"During Carlos's last albums he's had too many calaberations. none of them are even famous artists. I liked he way it used to be when the good ol' hits were around like...o Ye Como Va, and Blues for Salvodor. I've owned this cd for 2 years now, and i had thought it would grow on me but....It DIDN'T. This album is a really big joke that should have never been released from the studio. 1 star i give it."
2,SuperUnnatural,"I bought Shaman with much anticipation because I loved Supernatural immediately. I've been a fan of Carlos from way back (my favorite album is Abraxas), but this CD has disappointed me. Perhaps it will grow on me."
1,5 Stars ? You Got To Be Kidding...,"I heard 'Victory is Won' on the radio and so I bought the CD. That piece reminds me of something called 'Son Becomes Father' from the Hellecasters, whom I love. I love Santana, especially the first album (the one with the lion). By the way they were records back then. Anyway, Supernatural was very good. The synergy with Dave Matthews was very good. However, this CD is 95% pure crap (except for Victory Is Won). The Amazon reviewer was right on on that score. Carlos, we want more Soul Sacrifice, Jingo and Samba Pa Ti type songs. Forget this hip-hop, rap stuff. If any of you really think alot of Santana and gave this 5 stars, listen to Abraxas and Santana I. You will quickly realize that this is not at the same level. If you listen closely to Shaman, you can hear Santana playing background acid-rock to pop and hip-hop music. It is a bizarre combination; it just doesn't work."
1,Not a big fan,"Not only do I hate Chad Kroger... but I despise him. And not only do I despise Chad Kroger, but I also hate Alex Band and even the man... Santana.The fact is simple... that ""Why don't you and I?"" song has two different verions. Not only is this a blatent rip off (who wants to hear Chad Kroger sing when they could just as easily bang their head against a wall?), but no where is this explained to anyone.Not only did I think that somehow Chad Kroger grew some talent on this album (he didn't), but I also lost an $800 bet in the process. On EVERY SINGLE radio station (but one), this is announced as Chad Kroger singing. IT'S NOT!!Who ever heard of Alex Band anyway??? I hate them all and I wish nothing but stubbed toes, baldness and impotence to anyone that had anything to do with the production of this album."
1,Santana ripping off Silver,"The Game Of Love (Featuring Michelle Branch) is a complete ripoff of Wham Bam Shang-a-Lang by the 70s group ""Silver"". In fact, the song may even be in the same key...check out Have a Nice Day Super Hits of the 70s on CD Vol 19 and listen to that track...Influence is one thing, but this song is a complete ripoff musically...Grammy winner my a**"
1,It sucks...,"Let's face it, Carlos Santana can't play guitar..With that in mind I hope you all buy records with GOOD guitarists instead, like Kevin Eubanks or Michael Angelo!"
2,Supernatual II,"I'm a huge Santana fan, I've been to over 15 shows and own nearly every LP, but I'm very disappointed by Shaman, which could easily have been called Supernatural II.This LP sounds and feels EXACTLY like Supernatural. Heck, even the video for ""Game of Love"" looks exactly like ""Smooth"". Supernatural was a great LP, and I'm very happy Carlos received the acolades he deserved from it, but I was hoping for a more Santana-like album this time around.The only songs that remotely sound like classic Carlos are ""Victory is Won,"" which was an instrumental mainstay of the last tour (you might remember it as the intro to ""Smooth"" at the 2000 Grammy Awards), and ""America,"" which really highlight's his mastery of the guitar.It's a shame Carlos seems to have gone pop.One good thing about Shaman: It should spark sales for Santana's classic albums, because that's what you'll want to hear after listening to Shaman."
4,Guest tracks from Santana,"""Shaman,"" Santana's follow up to ""Supernatural,"" is unfairly maligned by Santana traditionalists. Musically, it's a lot better than much of the stuff he recorded in the 80's and 90's. It's really a collection of guest tracks that should have been on someone else's album.Santana left his roots with ""Caravanserai"" and ""Welcome,"" both of which are fine albums. There's more quality music in Santana's back catalog than most other musicians could ever hope to produce in a lifetime."
5,Gracias Carlos,"Still got that fire; that passion. Although I have not heard of most of them, the back-up artists were pretty good and have provided you some really nice songs as well, no doubt elated at having had the opportunity to play with a master.Jose Carreras was a nice touch too, although I personally would have preferred to have heard him sing in either Spanish or Italian; the accented English lacked credibility.I really don't like comparisons, but would say that I'm listening to ""Shaman"" more than I did ""Supernateral""."
5,One of Santanas best,Great music. This has to be one of his best albums. I really like the song with Michelle Branch. Seal is awesome. Just a great mix of talent.
2,disappointing,"This is an awful album.. I hope Carlos will come back to play the music we like. Carlos... why don't you collaborate with Ry Cooder and the Cuban musicians, instead of all these pop stars? I heard you declaring you have a great consideration for the music of Riky Martin..I cannot believe to it!"
3,"""Why Don't You & I"" doesn't feature Chad Kroeger","The version of Why Don't You & I that is on the radio features Chad Kroeger from Nickleback. The version on the CD features Alex from the Calling. That disapointed me, but the CD was good anyway."
1,Supernatural Leftovers,"I have been a Santana fan since 1970. Shaman definitely is not a Santana album. Sounds like a bunch of songs that did not make it in Supernatural. On top of that, Carlos presence in the album is just as a sideman or worst, a studio musician. Also,¿whatever happened to the Santana Band? The band is relegated only to ""Santana musicians"" and the whole package and music is overloaded of the image of Carlos Santana.Come on Santana (the whole band), just play the truly Santana music. The only song that deserves some attention is ""Victory is won"" and by the way the live version of this song on the Supernatural Evening DVD is by far superior than this studio version (the drum play is horrible compared to Rodney Holmes and even the guitar solo is much more intense)In the meantime, I will hear Caravanserai,Welcome and Borboletta to try to forget this is happening."
2,Same old Santana,"Does Santana know how to play anything other than the same old licks and the Santana "" note"".? This album is just a bunch of people with completely different styles with Carlos dribbling out the same old lines. Does he not have different guitars?Has he never playes with different tunings? How can you be such an accomplished artist and not change after so,so many years?If you want safe, secure and middle aged then buy it. And spare me the garbage about being tied to his record company.This is a man who claims his spirit is soooo important to him. Really.You wouldn't know it..."
3,Only Santana Fans,"My sister highly recommended this CD, so I tried it. What a disappointment! I like the songs I hear on the radio from him, but seeing how I'm not a hard core Santana fan I now have a dust collector for an auction site."
3,Santanas new formula,"It's great to see Carlos in the limelight and he uses his new formula to continue his legacy. The music is overall great...But, as a older fan of his, I do not get into the addition of the latest and greatest Pop singers that have added thier flare to this record. Though, the writing by Rob Thomas stands out as the best of them & The Game of Love is a sure Jem. It would have been nicer to have Carlos write more of his own tunes like the awesome Victory is Won. All in all...good stuff. Foo Foo is the only track I would have left to pasture."
2,Not Supernatural,"I bought this CD based on the awesomeness of Supernatural and was hugely disappointed. The Michelle Branch song is good, but the rest of the songs are pretty blah, including the Seal song which surprised me since I also love Seal. Plus, the songs are have the Latin feel I would normally expect from a Santana album."
4,Eloise!,"This video was adorable! I remember Eloise from when I was a child, and I'm happy to be able to share the stories with my daughter. This is a perfect little video for those long car rides, or waiting in the doctors office, or just cuddling in the coudh. I just love Eloise, so this one was a big hit!"
5,Excellent and Cheap Flash for Nikon DSLR,It's a excellent flash for Nikon DSLR. I tested it in a Nikon D50 and it works great. And the best it is cheaper compare with Nikon flash. I recommend it.
1,"If you want the cheapest , this is it","I ordered it and I was pretty dissapointed in it. It was very diffucult to get the batteries to go in and I had to re-load them 10 times before I could it to work. Maybe the one I got was defective, hard to say. But it was very fustrating to get it work right out of the box. I took a few pics with it it seemed to work ok, But I had a bad 1st impression and it did feel very cheap and decided to return it immediately and exchange it for an SB-400. Not trying to switch ya to the Nikon flash but it much much more sturdier. For someone who will not use it a whole lot and is looking price as thier main buying influence this is it."
3,some good,"it is a good flash, makes good quality pictures, but when you turn it on it will have very HI sound. it is little annoying when i do photography and operate sound."
3,Head in a Jar Prop,"The Laboratory Head in a Jar Prop was ok. I thought it would be bigger, closer to the size of a real head. I worked out fine in my haunted house."
1,Ted Doing What Ted Does Best,"Ted doing what Ted does best-- blow his own horn. If you're looking for good information about bowhunting, look elsewhere."
5,Great Watch,"My wife bought this watch for my birthday and I'm very happy with it. I like everything about it, design, features, interface, weight.Greate value for the price!!!"
5,Masculine time piece,The styling is very masculine. The buttons on the right side get bumped too easily inadvertently. It is very comfortable to wear. Changing between time zones is an easy adjustment.
2,"Watch is fancy but,","You can only set times in 1-hour differences from UTC. This fact has not been included (conveniently glossed over) in the product description. This means that being an Indian, I can use this watch only if I pretend to be a parisian, or if I have to add/subtract half an hour to the time on my watch every freaking time. What use is a watch if you cannot set even the local time right when you are traveling internationally? It has not been published on the site that this watch cannot be set for time-zones of Canada, Mid-australia, India, Newzealand."
2,Hard to see,Be careful what you wish for. My wife bought me this watch for Christmas. She and I thought the watch had everything I wanted in a watch. But when I opened it up on Christmas morning. I realized that with all of the features I desired I could not read the watch. Everything is too small to read. All of a sudden I now feel very old because I had to use reading glasses just to tell the time. I also found that the watch does not have a back light. I really need a back light. My wife was upset when I asked her to return it. But I figured at $300.00 I should be able to use the watch. Fortunately she enjoyed her gift.
4,good everyday sport watch,"The watch is accurate, easy to use, low maintenance. Good night visibility, not very heavy compared to my other titanium chronographs. The wrist band is of good quality and the titanium feels very comfortable. I wear this watch 7x24 and has no problem with it so far.Just took this watch to snowboarding and the watch survived all my beginner-level falls and bumps."
4,Nice Looker!,"Got the watch for Christmas. Great looking watch. The features are nice. I was surprised that there is no backlight, but I will keep it nonetheless. I recommend!"
4,Great Watch,I bought this watch as a present from Amazon. It was obviously a used watch because the box was banged up and the band was scratched in multiple places. All in all my husband loves the look of the watch. He is always commenting how light the titanium is and how he can look at all the different time zones. I would recommend this watch to all flyers.
1,I was robbed!,"I purchased this item thinking it was a good deal for $280 free shipping. When I received it, the face was VERY scratched. I paid $7 to mail it back and requested a full refund. However, I was charged $56 for a reshelfing fee!! BE CAREFUL WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE. IT'S NON-EXISTANT. Items advertised as new are obviously not always so!"
4,UTC a great feature,"This watch was originally intended as a pilots watch and I think it fills this role wonderfully. The comments in the other review are valid, except I'd say UTC is a 'must have' feature in a pilots watch (all air traffic control is done in UTC time)."
5,Great watch,"I am a watch nut, and I owned many many watches over the year. This is the best watch I have ever owned. I have the titanium model which is especially nice because it is so light.This is the perfect every day watch."
1,Not worth the money,Looks attractive and worked well initially. However after 3 years it just quit. Won't run and won't recharge just lies there dead.
1,never again,"when the eco drive watch had a cloud of moisture on the inside of the crystal,i sent it back to citizen for warranty repair.they supposedly repaired it and returned it. some 8-10 months later,it did it again,so i returned it still under warranty.they claimed i had unscrewed the crown and would not repair it without payment.i never knew the crown could be removed and never touched it.they are the only ones who ever serviced the watch. never again.was going to sue,but they aren't worth the time."
3,i guess a good review,"cool watch, superlight, a little trciky when it comes to programind times and stuff in, but overall it is well worth the money"
4,great light watch,"pros:-great looking-light. compared to seiko SNA, this watch is really light.-never need a battery.-the crown is protected so it does not rub against your skin, like on my seiko sna which causes skin irritation.cons:-no light. hands are luminous though not all night long.-The time zone is used for both date and time, i wish i could set the other timezone to paris, but still have the date local.-The timezone setting is too easy to change so my tz is sfo but when i date mode i need to make sure it's in a different time zone.-some features are night though i never use them: GMT time and 24 hours clocks; slide rule. the slide rule is a little difficult to rotate. The instructions could include a few pages to explain how to use it instead of letting us search the internet for instructions on a circular slide rule.-the alarm is not very loud.Bottom line:great watch. i have many watches but use this one most of the time."
4,Problem with metallic band,"The watch is great looking but I had problem with the wrist band, a pin came out and had to be fixed by watch repair person. I wish they make a strong, supportive wrist band, and given some more extra links."
2,Defective watch,"I just purchased Citizen Men's Skyhawk Eco-Drive Watch #JR3060-59F online from Amazon.com, but one of the pushdown buttons on the righthand side of the watch gets stuck and is not working properly, I have to return it. The watch does not even give me a chance to use it, too bad."
5,Citizen Skyhawk Titanium,Fantastic Watch. Do not let previous reviews about the titanium version being scratch prone prevent you from buying the titanium Skyhawk. First of all I am very hard on watches. I have had my Titanium Skyhawk around six months and have no scratches to speak of. I have hit it several times and have been suprised by the watch and watch band strength and their scratch resistance.Overall this is a great watch and I highly recommend it.
2,How can you make a sports watch you can't read in dim light?,"Before I reveal its critical flaw, let me say I love the way the watch looks.That said, the watch has no backlight!!! I cannot see the analog time at night and the digital display is completely unreadable even in dim light (have you ever seen an LCD display on a watch that didn't have a backlight?). Not having a backlight is an inexcusable flaw on a watch this price. And the phosporescent watch hands fade in about an hour, so that doesn't help much. Of course, you could just carry a flashlight with you.Because of this flaw, I rarely wear the watch. I wear a cheaper Casio with a backlight that I do not like anywhere near as much.If considering this watch against any other, just make sure you also consider how important it is to you to be able to read the time in the dark and to be able to read the digital LCD display when you don't have optimal light. If it is important, find a different watch."
3,mixed bag,"I've gotten several compliments about how the watch looks. Having several digital watch functions built into a nice-looking watch is quite an accomplishment. However, there are two important flaws. First, this watch is hard to read in the dark. The hands have very little luminescent paint, with only the tips glowing at all and they fade pretty quickly once removed from the light. Second, the alarm is really quiet, at least to my ears. It won't wake me up unless I take it off and set it by the bed... a blanket totally smothers it. If I set the countdown timer, for instance to remember to take something off the stove, background noises often drown it out and I won't hear that, either. It might be too much to ask one watch to do everything and look great while doing it. If you really need to tell time in the dark or hear an alarm, go ahead and get a true digital watch."
1,Damaged CD,"A wonderful story, though short. But the CD was damaged upon arrival and won't play on any of my CD players except my DVD player. Go figure. I've got to return it."
3,Not her best,"Disappointed that these were short stories, and not Agatha's best. I love her work, but these were a bit too pat."
5,Buts,"For the Amazing Blondel lovers this cd is the next cd after england, so 25 years later the true follow up is made. The first song is oke but number 2 and 9 Fabulous. A real fine piece of music for the easy listerners. A must have for the Blondellers who liked the medieval sound."
1,Blondel reunites - they shouldn't have bothered,"First of all, the review above from Dirty Linen doesn't refer to this album. This is a new studio album recorded in 1997 - the band's first album with John Gladwin in about 22 years. Anyway, it's absolutely awful. The songs are meandering and unfocused, nothing like the marvelous stuff they were doing 25 years ago. If you're a fan of their vintage music, stay away from this one!"
5,"Wonderfully warm, wickedly witty recounting","If you change the labels, the story is still the same. For many of us, McNair Wilson has painted (with great accuracy) our spiritual heritage (the good, the bad, the ugly, the ridiculous) with his vivid recollections of ""life in captivity."" It is, indeed, an irony that, while we were supposed to be learning the tenets of spiritual ""freedom,"" many of us were acquiring emotional straighjackets in which to live out our spiritual ""liberty."" McNair Wilson shines his hilarious spotlight on this dark corner of our faith. It was of infinite value to me that he did not throw out the babies of grace and honor with the skewering bathwater. This book is a MUST READ for those who grew up in a culture of faith which did not celebrate creativity or non-conformity. You will see yourself/family/church on every page and be thankful for the freedom to recall,learn from and laugh at the past."
4,a walk down memory lane,"This book offers a funny way to remember growing up in church. McNair's family dealt with the frustrations that come with an active-church life with humor, a method we could all use a little more! My only complaint was that McNair painted himself and his family as the heros at first, and everybody else was always in the wrong. Eventually though, he admitted to his family's mistakes, which made them seem very real and personal. I think this book would be great for anyone who is carrying around bad memories from a childhood spent in church, especially those who have left. It is also a very encouraging book for artists of all kinds. I found it a little pricey, but still worth the extra dollars."
2,misleading,"A word of caution to this anthology of gay themed comics:the content is only in part explicitly sexual so it will disappoint the ones who were looking for this kind of fun; the same thing, reversed, means that people looking just for funny gay themed comics might be disturbed by the porn strips.I happen to like both good porn and funny strips but I was disappointed nonetheless: most comics inside are just average, with the obvious exception of Tom of Finland and the possible exception of ""Meatman"". There is a lot of bad or indifferent drawing as well as bad or indifferent storylines.One could say that an anthology anthologizes the extant and that if gay comics of the past (most from the '70sand '80s) are average then the anthology must perforce be average. Fine, but then I would have appreciated a thicker volume, giving more material for the rather outrageous price."
3,Gay,This was easily the gayest thing I have ever purchased. Too much penis and needed more vagina. WTF is wrong with people.
5,Great Book On Leadership,"There are many management ""aha's"" in this book. Kaplan and Kaiser draw on extensive formal research to give down-to-earth, practical advice to people leading organizations of all sizes. A key insight is that strengths and weaknesses are two sides of the same coin -- the core capabilities and behaviors of a leader. Another insight is the notion of using ""the right amount"" of a managment attribute and avoiding ""overdoing"" and ""underdoing."" I'm buying copies for the top 30 leaders of my company.Randy Battat, President and CEO, Airvana, Inc."
4,Mastering Men's Gymnastics,"I like this video, I think it is very useful for gymnastics purposes, though I would have like it to present more specific exercises, but the video is good."
1,disappointed,"I thought that I already sumbitted a comment on my expereince with this item. I received it in poor condition. The base was not connected to one of the main pieced of the humidifier, nor would it properly fasten. I sent it back & Amazon refunded my money in a timely manner."
3,Simply too loud.,"I have had this unit for one week. I am returning it tomorrow because it is ridiculously loud. Forget sleeping--I can barely hear the TV over it! If noise is not an issue, then this item might still be a good deal for you. I paid $24.99, which I thought was a good price for it. The positives are that it holds 2.5 gallons, instead of the usual 2 gallons in this price range, and it has a built-in moniter to let you know when it's time to change the filter. It says it can run for 24 hours without having to refill the water. I did not test this aspect, as I only run it while I sleep (or at least that's my goal). Another negative is that it has a sticker attached that says to call an 800 number before using. Thinking it might be a safety issue, I called. It automatically records the number--with registered name--and address you call from and gives you a voice response sales pitch. That ticked me off. I just bought a Honeywell warm mist unit today. Hopefully that will be better for me!"
3,Too Noisy,"I bought this humidifier because I was having trouble with my asthma this winter in the hot dry air of my home. I was desperate to try and add a little moisture to the air. I chose a ""cool-air"" product because the assumption was that I did not want to add any more ""hot-air"" than I already had, however, i have only used this product 2 or 3 times. It is way too noisy. The fan component of the humidifier makes it very difficult to sleep with it on, and my husband absolutely refuses to have it on when he is in the room. So whether or not the product can relieve the dryness in my bedroom is moot, since I can't use it!"
3,If looks could kill,"This little bugger does the job very well but two things I must add, if you are in heated room; it will make the temperature go down fast since it is a cool mist humidifier...... 2nd on full speed it is too noisy to keep in bedroom.It does look nice and I am using it without any powers because of above listed issues hence it is keeping my 14x13 room at 50% humidity, how? I just filled it up with tap water and I can see water level dropping day by day without turning it on, also I have a digital humidity monitor in my room and I can watch the humidity level with or without HM1230 in the room."
2,Way Too Loud,"I wish I read the other reviews before I bought this. After a long night of dealing with a croupy kid, I went out and bought the first humidifier I found to replace the one that died last year. Even on the low setting, this unit is incredibly loud. My kids room is across the hall from mine and the noise kept ME awake. The turbo fans we use in the summer are less noisy. I'm taking it back today."
4,Wii-Stored,"When it comes to video game systems today, the Nintendo Wii has absolutely delivered this past year. However, a lot of us love the virtual console and the classic games like Super Mario 64, but we need the memory. This Switch N' Carry memory card can hold as much as 1 GB worth of memory for all your Wii needs. You can store all your data securely on Wii games like The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. You can also store games and data from games you've downloaded for the Wii's virtual console as a backup copy, if you bring your memory to your friends' house, or if you need to backup information in the even your Wii was damaged. I really recommend this memory card, Nintendo has made for all your Wii needs.Price: B 1/2-Quality: B+Overall: B"
5,"Twisted City is well, twisted","The mark of a great writer is to move the reader. The emotion can be positive of negative. This story of a financial writer drawn into the dark underbelly of New York and into schemes that out of his league kept me up at night.Jason Starr shows he is an outstanding writer with this gripping, terrifying ride into an odd and uncomfortable place. He makes you care about the poor guy whose luck goes from bad to worse.I highly recommend this and any other book by Jason Starr."
3,"Pretty Good, but...","Jason' Starr's writing is taunt and compelling and he weaves a twisted little plot well enough to keep me reading. The only real let-down for me is that this book seems to ""stop"" rather than end. After working his way through all of the twisted turns, Starr brings everything to an abrupt and unsatisfying halt. If the ending was supposed to be a surprise, it wasn't. An average reader will figure out (or at least strongly suspect) David's past history from the get-go. ""Twisted City"" is a good noir tale, but ultimately unsatisfying."
4,short review,This book tells us some application on Wavelet in a brand-new way.But is is not go deep into.
4,"It's Not Schubert, but facinating in its own write!","'Lieder, Piano Works Melodrama' by Friedrich Nietzsche is remarkable in that it is the second case of major German religio-philosophical thinkers, who also happened to compose music. The first was Martin Luther, and the two could not have been more different, aside from their Teutonic culture, which has produced well over half of the most important composers of European culture. The style lies somewhere between Schubert and Weill, with stronger affinities to the former. They are not GREAT, but they are really pretty good, but then anything Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau sings will sound pretty good, event the ingredients off a Wheaties box. Very interesting little corner of musical history!"
1,did not work in the USA,I bought this DVD for my little one and they said it would work in all regions unfortunately it did not and now I'm left with an unusable disk!
4,Peppa Pig,This has to be one of my son's favorite DVDs. He watches it so often I will be buying more peppa pig dvds. Happy to recommend. Cheerful and light entertainment for the little ones.
5,peppa pig dvd,"My 16 month old granddaughter LOVES this dvd. She watches it all day if you let her. Wonderful, funny stories. First saw it on Nick Jr. and had to see if I could get a dvd. Was thrilled to find one. But looks like only one is available for us format. Hope more will be available some day."
5,Really Great Customer Service from the United Kingdom,"I take full responsibility for purchasing an item that was not able to be viewed in the United States. As I look back at the product on the Amazon site, it is plainly written in RED that the item is not viewable in the USA, it is a Region 2 only product. I was so excited to see Peppa Pig available that I overlooked the warning that was in plain site. I have been in contact with the company who sent it and they have been so very cooperative in getting the 2 DVD's returned and they have been more than helpful and extremely kind. Just make sure when ordering that you are in Region 2 for viewing. We still love Peppa Pig, in fact it is one of our very favorites!!! And if Chalky's offers any products for the USA I would have no hesitation in ordering from them. They are a great company and you can order from them with confidence!!"
1,Disappointing.,"I was so excite to see Peppa Pig on DVD!!!! Unfortunately, I am very disappointed in the product. The sound quality is horrible. I adjusted every setting on my TV to try and improve to no avail. Also, the credits run after every single episode, so half of the DVD is credits!!! Hard to hold a young one's attention with credits!! Thankfully, Peppa is now availible on iTunes. Much easier to watch.I am a huge fan of Amazon. I buy whatever I can here. The product is not a reflection of Amazon's excellent customer service and wide selection of products. I'll be back!!!"
1,USA warning,Pay attention to the region friends...if you live in the USA and dont have a region 2 or British DVD player n odice...they don't work on USA region equipment.My Hubby made target practice of them...
1,not the same peppa!,"I was so excited that I had finally found peppa the pig for my 3 year old. Big dispappointment thats its different from nick jr, my daughter was not too thrilled either"
1,Who would be crazy enough to purchase at $350 for 1 DVD?,"Who would be dumb enough to purchase this DVD for $350, surely no one actually purchased this DVD for $350, can somebody please tell me why somebody would buy this for $350."
5,Bought for 2 yr old granddaughter,Bought this for my two year old granddaughter. The language in the dialogs are kept simple for understandability yet upbeat and fun. She has not grown tired of it yet and says the dialog along with the episodes.
5,peppa pig dvd,"I love this dvd, my kids can't get enough of peppa pig. They watch it everyday, it's a great dvd."
2,Not full episodes..,"My girls love Peppa Pig so I thought this would entertain them, which they did love it at first. But then my 6 yr old tells me that they are not the whole episodes. Then when I looked on the back the total minutes do not at up to 10 episodes. I know that on NickJr. they play 2 shows in a 1/2 hour, so I figured these are just 'shorts' of the episodes."
1,Read whole description when ordering,"I ordered this DVD for my daughter, put in the player and there was an error. I didn't read the whole description when ordering. This is a region 2 dvd. Which means it does not play in the US. So I have not been able to view it. :("
1,Did not Work!,"The movie arrived in a timely manner, but the DVD did not work! An error code appeared on every DVD player I tried."
2,Not for me,It was too expensive and a waste of my hard earned money. I wish it would have had bigger holes for the ta ta's. And it's not comfortable the way my chest and stomach rests on it. I will never use it. But that is just me. I had a nice pillow for the ta ta's years ago but my puppy chewed it up. Darn it! It had big holes and didn't fit but under the chest. So comfortable. But i can't find it out there anywhere.It looks to be well made and would last years and years if this is what you are looking for.
2,more garwood drivel,"Usually i love Julie Garwood's work, but this book is the last straw. after reading The Bride, The Wedding, Ransom, and many others, i have had enough of the same huge-but-gentle-scottish Laird-warrier-who thinks his new little-english-with a shadow in her past-wife is weak. this is probably a great read if you havent read above mentioned books, but more of the same if you have.MacBain marries Johanna for the her land-which fell to her when her previous husband fell off a cliff... but the body was never found. the marriage is NOT in name only, and johanna learns to love and deal with her highlander through their time together, etc. and so on and so forth.see The Bride, The Wedding, and Ransom for the same thing written better."
5,ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!,"This was the first JG book I have ever read. The author was recommended by a very good friend of mine in Atlanta, GA. This was one of those books you wish would never end. I loved the chemistry between Lady Johanna and Gabriel,(the Archangel). Many books have the couple fighting and bickering throughout until all is resolved in the end. Not so with this one. It was so outstanding. I wish Julie Garwood would write a book about Nicholas (Lady Johanna's brother) and Clare. I love it when the men are big, brave and ruthless and also possess huge and loving hearts!"
3,A familiar story,"Just like anyone else who has read more that one of Julie Garwood's books this story was immediately familiar to me. It runs along the same lines as The Bride and The Wedding just to name a couple. I much preferred those stories to this one. I agree with a previous review that if I read the words you need to rest one more time I was going to throw the book at the wall. Another thing that really bothered me was the amount of nodding going on in the story. It seemed that after every statement the character would nod to get their point across. It really irritated me, people usually don't constantly nod as they are talking. But in the scheme of things I suppose that is a minor complaint. Even though the author's books are a bit formulaic I still enjoy them. The secondary characters were entertaining, adding a lot to the story. This was a pleasant read, but it definitely will not be going on my keeper shelf."
3,Too chatty for my tastes,"I've given up on Julie Garwood - all of her books seem to read the same. They're not descriptive enough either - too chatty. She's a very verbal writer, with very little action. I felt like I was eavesdropping on a conversation instead of reading a novel! With that said, I must say it was well-written, even if a touch cliché - the beautiful little heiress with the ""my man's gonna save me"" mentality, which gets old real quick. The characters were likable and the storyline flowed well, I just couldn't get past how talkie this book was! I'm selling my Garwoods; any takers?"
3,Scottish Romance Lite,"This is without a doubt historical/romance fiction, LITE It lacks the weight and feel of books by the wonderful Kathleen Givens or exceptionally talented Susanna Kearsley who have written books with similar themes. This isn't a bad read by any means, it is, as I said, light, fun, and yes, romantic with plenty of 'all that' if that is what you are looking for in a book. Johanna and Gabriel have fairly nice chemistry albeit a little forced in feeling. They come together quickly but love doesn't come into play until later in the story. Johanna and Gabriel's histories are tragic but the author does not dwell too heavily on their pain. Supporting characters are fun but lack depth. But like I said, this is not a serious, heart wrenching tale by any means so it shouldn't be taken in any other way. Fun and romantic, 'Saving Grace' is a nice light , weekend read."
5,A Charming Story,"I almost didn't read this book as I have disliked almost every historical romances I've read where the heroin is a widower, however I'm immensely grateful that I didn't put this book aside!This is a charming story, the characters are delightful and refreshingly honest, and the story is simple and enjoyable!I have had mixed feelings bout Garwood's Historical romances but this one is defiantly one that is going on the keep shelf!"
2,Same old Garwood,"OK so this is a novel published in 1993, and they keep on publishing it because it has got a lot of fans. Millions of readers must love this novel.I found it boring. IMHO, the humour was very silly. The characters only talk and talk, but they say nothing interesting. Certainly, it was not -for me- one of those novels you cannot stop reading. I had to make the effort to end it.If you like highlanders the Garwood's way (this is - very brigadoonish) then you will love this book, because it's more or less the same as 'The Bride', 'Honor's Splendor' or 'The Secret'. A beautiful Englishwoman, a powerful and sexy Scottish warrior... Nothing new or surprising, I'm afraid. Perhaps it was refreshing in 1993, I honestly don't know.I will not read it again."
1,"trust me, not worth your time","I have read A LOT of historical fiction books... I got this one, trusting the raving reviews on it. I couldn't even finish it. The plot was dreadfully boring. The writing was choppy, and blunt, and it really bugged the heck out of me. It didn't flow. It makes me really not want to read another one of her books if its written like this one. The premise was good... I just wish I wasn't so bored! Gabriel, the male lead, was just downright mean! He wasn't likeable at all to me... and the female lead... she was just too accepting. There are much better books out there... please, don't waste your money on this one! Selling my copy!"
2,"Buy the book Not, I repeat, Not the tape!","I want to make it clear that I am giving the audio version two stars but the book receives 4 stars. I will not go into the story because others have done it and made a good job of it too. However, I had to write this review concerning the audio tape. I have read the book but got the tape because I do a lot of traveling and I wanted to listen to some of JG's books to break the monotony of driving. I was very disappointed because the audio version did not do justice to the book version. The tape missed out on critical scenes that makes it so fun to read (does that rhyme?). Anyway, the listener will not gain any of the humor and poignancy that the book reveals. I'm just saying if you got to have the tape get if from your local library first, they give you three weeks on loan, then listen and make your decision. But my advise is to just buy the book!"
3,personally have little time for Garwood,"This is a typical Garwood book--young, sweet miss gets married to a hulking beast...fall in love, etc. The portrayl of the Scots were so stereotypical from books that I wanted to kill the book (unfortunately it was the library's). I still can't get over the age difference... Still, the depiction of the battered wife was pretty good--which is why i gave a three. Other than that, the characters are pretty unrealistic. a sixteen year old miss going up against two clans? Yeah right!"
2,"Same story, different title","I've been reading other Julie Garwood books recently and this one is almost like an exact clone of The Secret... Tough man...small, weak woman... Boring!!! I really like Garwood's recent books but ones with the Highlander plots I have to force myself to finish."
2,Not her best...,"I'm not sure what everyone else is jumping for joy about regarding this book. Yes, the setting is romantic -- it always is. Yes, the dialogue between the two characters can be funny, entertaining, tender and emotive. However, I don't think that either Johanna or Gabriel were well drawn, full characters. Half the time Gabriel's thoughts and speech indicated that he should be smiling or grinning, yet Johanna would turn to look at him and he'd have a ""feroucious frown"" on his face. Nothing Garwood writes lets us know why these contradictions between his thoughts and demeanor occur. Johanna is even more of a shell. We are never allowed into her head long enough to see if she has a complicated though, and I doubt that she does. Garwood relies compleely on dialogue to move the plot, and it just doesn't. To empathize with these characters, we need to feel like we understand them. Half of what they do is ""out of the blue,"" a bad, bad sign for us dear readers."
5,standing ovation,"My first Julie Garwood book was The Wedding and I thoroughly enjoyed it. After that, I seemed to have gotten hooked on JG's medieval novels. Saving Grace is undeniably another one of Jule's best. I have never been disappionted in any of her books. She is truly a talented writer. In this crazy world that we live in we need a break every now and then and Julie unquestionably gives you just that with her novels. Her heroines are witty, and spunky. While the heroes are handsome and caring. Definitely a great read! Applause for Julie, keep 'em coming!"
5,You must read! it's a woderful captavating story!,I loved this book! You will not be disapointed. I love Julie Garwood and must say that this one was her best. You'll love all the characters. The heroine and the hero are lovable. This is well worth the money and you'll want to read it over agian. I defenitly have!
3,Not the best of her stories,"I was disappointed because from the reviews I read here, I thought it might be similar, if not better than ""Ransom"". Well, in my opinion it did not even come close to ""Ransom"". I did not connect to any of the characters in the story. Lady Johanna did not have any endearing qualities about her that I found to my liking or that convinced me as to why Gabriel would fall in love with her or have his men and people worship her. To me she seemed like any ordinary woman. I thought the story choppy and did not flow as easily as ""Ransom"". If I don't end this review now, it just might end up being another review of ""Ransom""."
1,Saving Grace,"I thought that this book was poorly written. The main character, Johanna, is just not interesting. She is a weak, timid mess. And her displays of ""strength"" in the book are a joke. The hero, Gabriel, also dull. Also, the constant harping by the author on the hierarchy in heaven and earth was tiresome. This is the first book by Julie Garwood that I have read and will probably be the last. The author just didn't capture my interest. If you feel you must read this book, I would check the library first for it and save my money for a better book by a better author."
1,SAME OLD THING!!!,I don't know why most of you are jumping for joy because this books it the best. IT'S THE SAME OLD THING. Julie Garwood always write beautiful women that seems so innocent but actually dumb. I don't like the way she potrays that everyone hots for the leading lady. The guy didn't really fell in love with her! He fell in love with her beauty and body. What if she was ugly? Would he still love her? Gabriel seems so amused and fascinated. By what? By a girl who'se so beautiful and innocent at the same time. Saving Grace is the same old thing. There is no love at all. There is only lust. :( I'm dissapointed at this book and I wish Mrs. Garwood would at least write one love story that the girl isn't that perfect.
1,uhhh ..... no,"i had read rave reviews for this book and thought that it would be on par with all the other amazing books i have read over the past few years. however i found this book to be poorly written and the characters had very little chemistry. the best parts of the whole book were the humourous ones and there were very few at that. i much rather prefer authors like lisa kleypas or gaelen foley whose stories have sizzling characters, heart-wrenching stories and also a believable by-plot. however i will say that the protectiveness that gabriel feels over johanna is slightly cute."
5,Utterly Charming!,"This is one of my favorite books by Julie Garwood. A love story so charming and tender it took my breath away. I rejoiced with their triumphs and I cried with their pain. This book belongs on my ""hands off"" shelf."
2,Size is not exact or...,"The product doesn't fit exactly as it should. It is either slightly too small or the sucking power of the A/C is bending the product so that there are gaps between the edge of it and the A/C vent. The filtering material seems good, but it just doesn't fit snug."
4,It does the job,This air filter works. It was handy to find filters in odd sizes to fit our odd-sized system. We like it.
5,Air Cond Filters,The item was as advertised and was a perfect fit for my unit. I reorder this item every three months and have for a couple of years. Recommended.
2,sj,I believe that medium of a book form has certain limitations when it comes to explaining moving actions such as chin na techniques. I bought this book prior to buying the dvd of YMAA production on chin na. i would say that it is better to get a dvd than a book if one is more keen to understand the techniques than the related informations.
5,Comprehensive and very clear,"This is an excellent volume. The explanations and content are very clear and thorough, and the photographs are also very clear. Anyone who is prepared to pay attention should be able to see what is going on throughout. There's good coverage of basic training for strength and speed, as well as the various types (finger, wrist, muscle-grabbing, etc.) of Chin Na."
5,"Great information, be prepared for experimentation","This book is highly informative and I feel the author has done a superb job of trying to translate what is an inherently complex topic into written form. Be prepared to have to experiment for a while with several of the techniques to get the correct feel. I like how the author catagorizes the techniques by finger, wrist. elbow, etc. As a former Aikido practioner, I will tell you, IMHO this book shows the depth and complexity of the Chinese arts. All in all, a great effort!"
5,Helps me in ALL of my training,"I am a teacher of Yoshinkan Aikido with 30 years of training in various martial arts, including Taichi and now Chin Na. I have been familiar with Dr Yang's works but never owned any of his books until last year. I finally had an opportunity to attend one of his seminars and now study with some of his students. I am also trying to collect as much of his works as I can.I found this book to be an excellent resource in my Chin Na studies and to help learn the techniques I am learning from the students of Chin Na and on the YMAA DVDs that I own.But, as the title suggests, this is for ALL styles.I am always looking at how martial arts are inter-related and share common techniques and principles. I also look for variations on techniques in my style and try to work them into my training and teaching.This book is not only helping me to learn Chin Na but has brought more depth to my Aikido."
2,Thought-provoking but inconsistent,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this book offers an interesting description of the spiritual experience of having ""no-self"" but isn't a particularly inspiring read. What was confusing though is that in the introduction we're asked to transcend viewing Suzanne's experiences pathologically, but in the epilogue she herself sees that she has been dissociated due to childhood sexual abuse. Why ask us to suspend a pathological interpretation only to invite us back to that interpretation at the end?"
4,The terror of the absolute,"Collision With the Infinite is a fascinating addition to the small but growing body of literature dealing with the Western experience of self-realization. Segal's narrative provides a compelling and disturbing account of her sudden, unsolicited and irreversible recognition of the utter emptiness of the Self nature, a realization that, because she lacked any guidance at the time it occurred, left her in the grip of overpowering terror. Even her acceptance and ultimate enjoyment of that condition was unstable and began to slip away as her health failed.Most accounts of enlightenment deal with it from the perspective of the blissful, exalted state it represents. Segal has given us a roadmap of the potential suffering that can arise when such transformations occur outside the traditional student teacher relationship."

1,Do Not Buy This Club,"I purchased this club. The very first time I hit it, the crown wrinkled like a cheap accordian. Not worth the money."
4,Another stop in my quest for all the early R&B vocal groups.,"Good cd. I bought this one after hearing 'Good Luck Darling' and being totally blown away! I was suprised to hear another absolute scorcher called 'Ooh wee baby'. Another feel-good nasty R&B song! There are more good songs on this one than bad ones, so I say grab it. By the way, there's also some good vocal harmony in the love ballads on this one."
1,Again no Closed Captiioning,"This is not a review of th oontent, but many will need to know that this series has no closed captioning and so is useless to so many who are hard of hearing and unable to hear slang, thick accents, mumbles and scenes with background noise drowning out the audio. My husband and I were unable to hear much in the first few scenes so gave up on a series that looks just like our cup of tea. Frustrating and sad."
4,Excellant British acting,"Well,crafted and multi-layered conspiracy thriller .No ""Disney"" conclusion here . Very thought provoking and believable. Will possibly leave you angry , yet motivate you to becoming an informed activist.....and at the very least be aware .People are the power , know your history and rebellions .Rudy-Paul"
4,Is this possible?,"Good movie, BBC style all over it, a little freaky, considering this could very much be possible, a little depressing too ...Very scary and shocking ending ...I recomend it."
3,"Okay show, not great.",With Benedict Cumberbatch from Sherlock in the major role had high hopes. This had so much potential with a great plot and story line. Only wish the writing was much better for the roles of the characters.
2,SNORE,This book may be well written but it is boring and bogged down with unnecessary difficult wording. This is a difficult read or maybe I'm just a doc student that needs the author to get to the point.
4,"Good, but...","Even though the classics will always be the classics, and Mr. ""Blue-Eyes"" can't be compared with anyone, it's a bit of shame that the sound in the record was not remasterized properly to give it its full glory. A nice buy, still"
3,these are sinatra's songs,"i'm a huge fan of ol' blue eyes, and i can't say i dislike this cd .. these are only some of his classic songs, and it's very enjoyable to listen to frank sinatra sing with some modern artists .. but some of the tracks are butchered by the other half of the duet .. they try to make it their own song, when the truth is, it's FRANK SINATRA's song .. it's his own genre, and some of the artists on the cd like gloria estefan, luther vandross, and julio iglesias, who are all in different music genres than sinatra, try too hard to make it sound different .. i guess they're trying to make the song unique, but it definitely doesn't work for me .. the highlights of the whole cd are ""they can't take that away from me"" & ""new york, new york"" and others"
2,Not so great!,"I'm a die hard Sinatra fan, but it seems like Capitol is trying to wring every penny from him and just slap anything together. I was very disappointed in this CD. Considering it was put out by Capitol, I thought the audio quality would be much better than it was. As it is, the transfer of sound from TV to CD is very poor; in some cases the artist voices were pretty undistinguishable. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one."
2,sound quality poor,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. I though a lot more effort could have been done to try to clean up static, background noise, et cetera. Sound quality seems poor and you really have to turn the stereo up to hear the CD."
3,"Good content, bad sound","The music is great but it really is a shame that the audio quality is so poor.I realise there really is nothing that can be done about it, as the material came from old television videotapes. But the buyer should beware and go into this purchase knowing that they are not getting nicely recorded material. Its just above bootleg quality."
2,Duets III is a Disappointment,"Although I loved ""Duets"" and ""Duets II"", ""Duets III"" simply does not make the grade. With 21 tracks, perhaps the producer thought that he'd make up for in quantity what the album lacks in quality. Quality is what is lacking in this album. The tracks are of poor acoustical quality compared to Duets 1 and 2. It sounds as though most of the tracks were lifted from TV and radio recordings - the sound quality truly suffers in the process. Oh, there are some brief rays of sunshine, but overall, the album only appeals to those who have to have every song Sinatra ever recorded.I do not recommend this album. If you can get it used or at a discounted price it might be worth it, but even then, it is an album that disappoints.Jim Konedog Koenig"
2,"Good story, poor writing.","True, this is a good story. It is a factual and interesting history of the local area. However, the writing techniques of the author leave much to be desired. This book is filled with rambling sentences, and paragraphs of facts. The timeline jumps around, and it's hard to follow. It's obvious that the writer doesn't have much experience. The story deserves a better account. Still, if all you're looking for is newspaper and court accounts, you may like this book as much as the other readers who rated it."
2,"For Crimson Die-Hards, Presenting the Weakest of 69-74 LPs","Islands can be a tough first listen, or a tough tenth listen. I myself am probably only up to about listen number twelve (to paraphrase author Eric Tamm). Of all the Crimson albums released from 1969 to 1974, it is by far the strangest and weakest (excluding live albums, which at least have versions of ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" going for them!) Of course Islands has its moments; ""Ladies of the Road"" is good bluesy fun, and Fripp beats the bejezus out of his Les Paul on the extended solo to ""A Sailor's Tale,"" but guess what? These two bright spots can be found on Frame By Frame, one of the greatest boxed sets of all time."
2,One gem among a pile of rubbish.,"Ladies of the Road is a brilliant rock tune, but that's it, the rest of this is a wasted effort. The musicianship is not particularly inspiring. Following this studio effort Crimson recorded the brilliant Lark's Tongue in Aspic, Starless and Bible Black and Red. Stick with them as they are testimony to what Crimson was capable of at their best. Give this one a skip...Simon"
3,Broken brilliance,"3 1/2It is hard to get past Islands hit-or-miss presentation, even if the hits are glaring, underappreciated, and outweigh the misses."
4,Underrated,"This Crimso line-up gets dissed a lot, and yes Boz Burrell was a beginner bassist(taught by Fripp because they couldn't find someone who would stick around)and Ian Wallace lacks the grace of a Giles or Bruford (or Andy McCulloch even). Even so there are great moments here(as well as on the live material from this era which I collect more than any other period).There is the light ""Formentara Lady"", the blistering instrumental ""Sailor's Tale"", the rocking, even bluesey (for Crimson) ""Ladies Of The Road"". Mel Collins blows a mean sax throughout this release."
3,Only for true fans,"Everyone says this album has one great song, but no one agrees which song it is. Crimson fans will probably like at least 3/4 of them -- if they like the Mellotron. Here's my review, song by song.Formentera Lady: Terrible lyrics, terrible singing, good playing of a terrible melody. Echh.Sailor's Tale: A wonderful instrumental.The Letters: Terrible lyrics, terrible playing of a terrible melody. It hurts to listen to it.Ladies of the Road: Sinfeld's wet dream. Junk.Song of the Gulls: Slow and perfect.Islands: Dorky lyrics, perfect musicianship.Summary: What a wierd arrangement of musicians for an album aimed at the rock and roll crowd (string bass, oboe, coronet); BUT IT WORKS! Oh, and Fripp was correct in firing Sinfeld."
1,A blot on a noble discography,"Crim-loving friends of mine assure me that this album is a misunderstood masterpiece. I understand it perfectly well, and it's an embarrassment, quite the worst Crimson album ever and only not a trial to sit through because it's so boring. The lyrics are among the drivellingest Peter Sinfield ever committed to paper, the musicianship is no more than competent (Fripp's much-praised solo on Sailor's Tale sounds to me like uninspired thrashing fed through a reverb to make it sound more tortured) and the vague gestures towards classicism are frankly amateurish. In fact the only pleasure to be regularly received from Islands is the comforting delusion that one could have done better oneself. Strange that, two years later, this band was one of the best in the world."
1,ugh! Udder I mean utter nonsense!,"Oh sure yeah right people look at a white wall with red dots and scream ""THAT IS ART!!!!!"" yeah whatever ok sure. This is not music it is not even rap it is just noise, some guy plinking and doodling on two guitar strings and some other bloke banging a bell in the background and playing some nature music to try and mix things up. Really not good just noise, not even a jam session so just pass on this and say see you later alligator."
5,My favourite King Crimson!,"The first time I heard this album I was blown away!! I was in Frank's house with him and dad, and they just put it on nice and loud!!! It tripped me out and hit me hard!!I think it was ""The Letters"" that really got me hooked. Dad made sure I payed special attention to it, and when it started roaring my mouth literally dropped! And yeah...Well this is my favourite KC album so I'd advise people to get it regardless of their tastes!"
3,worth checking out for Crimson freaks..,"Islands fills in the gap between Lark's Tongues and Lizard. One of its downfalls is definitely having a singer who is scarcely suited to the group, who sings in a pestering Micheal Crawford manner (I prefer the wheezy Jon Whetton variety for Crimson, personally). Highpoints are the sinister sounding 'Sailor's Tale' and 'Ladies of the Road', one of the King's rare and amusing attempts at misogyny."
3,S.S. Crimson runs out of steam island-hopping.,"Considered the weakest of the first four King Crimson albums, Islands really has to be heard in the right context. A mind-set of warm gulf breezes, palm trees, still-water bays, sea gulls and the solitude of the ocean sets the stage for this understated, yet affecting set of songs. The colorful dayglow island art on the U.S. album cover is far more in keeping with the ""ambience"" of the music than the inappropriate star nebula photo that adorned the British cover (and the CD). Don't confuse Islands with anything Jimmy Buffett might come up with - this is a very strange, gentle, mysterious and ultimately haunting cruise that only guitarist Robert Fripp could captain. The title cut is a near-classic, but it was the rollicking Ladies Of The Road that garnered the most airplay. Islands tends to grow on you slowly, like the tide..."
5,Clean clear and wholesome entertainment for entire family,"I recently bought this CD and was quite surprised that the lyrics were more about good family values and morals along with concerns about our world rather than wasting their time worrying about things that are not as important, and can do very little about. I reccomend this highly to those who are looking for someone with a good voice that brings a better outlook on things into their lives."
2,Who are you?,"This book is a very interesting look in to one mans mind about the social problems plaugeing today's society. I am a christian, and I don't agree with most of the things that Mr. Johnston talks about. I think he has no basis for any argument of most of the subjects covered in his book. I give this book a 2 because it is written from a personal opinion standpoint and not based on strong fact."
5,Richard's Review,"The book arrived in very good order with only minor ""dog ears"". That being said, the book is easy to read and understand, and well put together."
5,"A ""parent friendly"" psychological guide","Signals From The Child: Learn To Read The Secrets In Drawings And Refrigerator Art by forensic handwriting expert Jean Coles is a ""parent friendly"" psychological guide to interpreting how a child feels from the drawings and artworks he or she creates. A tool for learning to what to expect and what to extrapolate, Signals From The Child is very highly recommended reading for parents, grandparents, teachers, and counselors seeking to facilitate better communication and understanding between themselves and a child."
1,Down in the Garden Book by Anne Geddes,The book was never described as a little tiny book. Here I thought I was getting a coffee table book size and this is almost like a wallet size. Very disappointing not knowing what you were getting when ordering
1,High Kitsch,"Geddes' manages to degrade and isolate her subjects. Her prehistoric ""cutsie"" images, though appealing to a kitsch market, do not allow for a social comment to transcend the visual confines of her exploitive commercial ""photography"". In some senses, she could be seen as a radical post-modernist artist, as she abstracts the subject from social normality and removes any dignity from the development of the child, if that was her so calling in contemporary art. Yet it is frightening to be in an age where people will grasp such superficially degrading images. Geddes has made a personal fortune off photographing babies, subjects usually positioned in inhumane circumstances (ie: babies in flowerpots or dipped in custard), which removes human dignity and allows us to question Geddes moral intent."
2,creepy,"My 2 year old loves another blackboard bear book, so I got this one thinking she might like it. The story takes a creepy turn, though, with the bear eating the older kids who wouldn't include the main character in their playing. It's not explicit, but strongly suggested. I think this one might be going to the used bookstore."
5,Tonyea's evaluation,I liked this book because it has woolly mammoths in that book. My favorite part was when the Indians had set a trap for the mammoths and the mammoths got killed. Other kids would like this book because it has saber-toothed cats in the book.
4,"Understanding Writing, Bradrick","Love it. I've used this in homeschooling two of my children. Follows them for several years of writing. Incorporates _Elements of Style_, etc. Great method for teaching Christian worldview in writing."
4,Adorable!,"It was a bit of a pain to put up, but it looks fantastic! We both love the way it looks in the nursery. I'm very happy with this purchase. It would have received 5 stars if it was a bit easier to apply to the wall. It takes at least 2 people to put this up."
4,very cute,"This wallpaper border was the perfect touch to finish off our nursery. We had bought coordinating paint (a pale yellow) at an affiliated site. It was easy to apply - my spouse was surprised. You just have to dip it in water and then paste it onto the wall, smoothing it down with a brush. It's important to measure your wall segments first. We only used it on one wall because we didn't have enough in one roll to cover the entire room. For medium-sized to large rooms, buy two rolls. But it does make that wall look like an accent wall. It's definitely a great addition to a Nojo Jungle Babies decor."
5,Gorgeous.,"I am still amazed that Missing Persons and Dale Bozzio never got the world wide recognition that they deserved. Dale could have easily been the next Madonna. They should have hit UK by storm. Maybe they did as I was too young to remember. However as an 80's mega fan I am always discovering new 80's records and bands like this one. In this album Dale slightly changes her style as she's signed to Prince's Paisley Park record label, however still fantastic songs and beats none the less. And Dale is just Gorgeous to look at, she was such a hottie and the cute squeaks make me go crazy, not to mention her outfits. You can tell where Lady Gaga got her style from,I love her."
3,Reasonably Happy,The frying pan was not as deep as the original one I was replacing. Other than that it works well.
2,This is NOT nonstick!,"I was so glad to get such a good deal pan + a glass lid, but the pan is a really bad quality, i clean it in dishwasher and often fat sticks to the surface. Plus the pan is not entirely flat so while frying something oil doesn't distribute evenly on the surface.The lid is very good on the other hand and I use it even for other pans."
2,Poor quality,"This pan came with its bottom screwed up...did not turn it back cause I am lazy to do so.I notice that on the heat, the teflon cover started to have small bubbles and after few times using it, the teflon started to come out...as I know, teflon could cause cancer. I throw it away. Hope to find a better pan."
2,"Decent massager, but not for the price.","I've purchased other products from Interactive Health, including the iJoy (which is AMAZING compared to other massage chairs I've tried), and their Ottoman 2.0 (which hits the spot on the calves wonderfully).I bought this in hopes to get the same quality and effect as I have from their other products, but have been disappointed. The two massaging handles on either side of the pillow massage the sides of my neck well, but doesn't hit the back of my neck at all--and that's where my sore spot always tends to be at! The ""pillow"" itself is hard and can be uncomfortable, so you have to position your head carefully in order to really relax.I wouldn't recommend purchasing this massager at its expensive price. However, should you find this massager on sale, it's a decent product. I'm still in the pursuit of a more effective neck massager, though..."
5,Remarkable,"How a colorless, odorless and tasteless liquid does so much, I don't know. Without it, I die. Thank goodness I can buy it here. ""Air Juice"", as we call it in Georgia, falls from the sky but never in convenient plastic storage containers as described above. I drank several bottles of this with few ill effects - and none of the congestion that I got from the Bovine Nectar I had previously purchased."
4,Great toy but propellers prone to break,"I have had 3 or 4 of these for my boys over the years. They love them. You pull them back, let go and they shoot forward and the propellor spins. While the plane is quite sturdy, little fingers will break the propellor eventually. My kids still liked them once broken but not as well. I am sure I let my kids play with them at a younger age then you are suppose to, but that is when they are most facinated. They used them heavily from age 2-6. If you don't want to deal with the propellor, look for the Jet Blue or AirForce One pull backs. They won't break (but aren't quite as cool)."
1,Critic,"This is by far the worst Gisselle cd. She rose as a merengue star, and is now falling as a mediocre ""pop wanna-be""."
3,anthony kuuselas review,Well this book was a really good book because it was an action packed book and the story is always changing. One minute Alex is on an island and the next minute he is in a city. That is one reason I liked this book it was action packed with tons of places that I can sort of connect with and I would recommend this book to any one who like a action filled novel. This is a book that I like so much that when ever I read a passage I didn't want to stop reading. The other reasons I book is because it has a very good way of making you visualize what is happening in the book. You can see in your head what is going on. I also liked the fact of how it gave an accent to the characters this is also not a hard book to read it is well based and very descriptive. That is most of the reasons I like this book there are a ton of other reasons but I can't think of them right now so hope my review lets you know this a very good book
3,Skeleton Key Anthony,"It is exciting, amazing and surprising.It makes you think that you're in the book.exposition:In this book Alex is working for the MI6 and he almost got killed.Rising action:He flew to the United States and started working for the CIA.When he got there, he found out that he had to be in another mission.climax:The mission was called Skeleton Key.Falling action:Before Alex goes to Skeleton Key two guys were killed by and German general that is living on the island. resolution:Alex is going to see what happened to the two spies."
5,Give Me More,"Yet another great Alex Rider book. I read this book in seriously one day. I think that it took me about four hours because this book has such a strong flow that you will not want to stop. In this story Alex Rider discovers that not all dreams come out the way that you expect them. This book is yet another great book from Anthony Horowitz, and he is definitely become one of the best young adult writers out there. I just picked up Eagle Strike the next book in the series so I will come out with another review for that book soon.READ THIS SERIES!"
4,Great,"I was moved, it was an amazing book and I hope to enjoy the next book just as much as the first through the third"
4,This is a really good series for adolescent boys.,"I am an English teacher reviewing this series for student consumption. I think it is an excellent series, especially for adolescent boys. The girls, however, enjoy it too."
4,skeleton Key,"The world saving teen Alex Rider. The book skeleton Key is about a teenager spy that saves the world. He went with the C.I.A to spy on sarov on the island called skeleton Key. Sarov capures him and holds him at his house. The two C.I.A agent he went with where never seen again. The theme of the book is when alex saved Russia from getting blown up. The reason why Anthony Horowitz might have wrote the book is for intertainment. The book was exiting and intence always because he was trying to escape from Sarov to save the world. In part of the book it said, The grind stones were getting closer with every second that passed. He could feel the vibration trensmited down the conveyor belt.This part was important because Alex Rider could have ben killed right their. I recomend all ages to reead this because it is intence, exiting, and all around fun to read."
4,Danger on the Island,"I would definitely recommend this book to my friends. One of the awesome parts of the book is that you can feel the suspense and tension the main character goes through as the exciting plot unfolds. Each chapter is a page-turner because of the action in the story, and the fact that you can relate to the way Alex feels and acts, if you are about 14 years old. The dramatic ending leaves you ready to open up the next Alex Rider book in the series."
4,Evil Ruskie and Frankenstein,"Reading the Alex Ryder series with my son enables short and brief discussions of the books.This 4th of the series is the best and getting better.With a Russian General, Private Jets,conspiracy, Carribean adventure and reconstructed hit men, what's not to like?"
4,Skeleton Key,Skeleton Key was a very good action or mystery book. Alex Rider a junior secret agent really made it like a young James Bond book. It provided excitement and non-stop action. It was in my opinion the best book out of the first two of this series of Alex Rider novels. This book was a good book and i would recomend it.
5,"""Boy saves world from Nuclear Bomb""","Skeleton KeyAlex Rider is a fourteen year old boy who has been asked to work for the MI6, again. The MI6 have used Alex twice before and this time would be the last mission the MI6 would use him for. They told Alex that this time would only be a surveillance operation (that's what they said).Alex was going to be sent to Cuba with fake I.d.and fake parents. His parents disappeared in the book but the question is where...If you want to know what happens in the book check it out at a library near you.I loved this book because it kept me guessing on what would happen next in the book. I have read the other books in the series but this book still kept me guessing at what would happen next.If you like books that deal with things like James Bond or the CIA this is a book that you would want to check out. If you like books that deal with people taking over the world this book is for you. If you want to read the series the first book is Stormbreaker."
4,Alex Rider vs Young James Bond vs Jason Steed vs Cherub,"This is a great story, again Anthony Horowitz has us on the egde of our seats.The story has a very similair theme to the Young James bond book Hurricane Gold. In Skeleton Key Alex Rider and Hurricane Gold Young James Bond, both teen hereos are on a hot tropical island owned by a villian, both villians want to adopt the young teen heros, despite the youngsters trying to spoil there plans. Both villians let the boys go. However both are fast paced and good reading. Its a shame they have followed the same pathm but if you are into Alex Rider, Jason Steed, Cherub and Young James Bond this is still a great book."
3,Skeleton Key by Alex Rider Book,The book was in excellent condition but the shipping took over three times the length stated on the order.
2,Not as good as the first two!,"in this book, alex had a pretty exciting mission but horowitz did not make it exciting. all his adventures were dull. there wasn't any action at all. i suggest you read the first two-which were much better because alex was smarter. the reader will feel that in stormbreaker and point blanc there was more action and cool parts. also, in skeleton key, alex gets a girlfriend and she is an unimportant character who doesn't do anything but distracts alex."
5,Even Better Then The Others,I read this book as soon as I could get it from the Library. It was awesome. Alex got into even more trouble then before. Skeleton Key was much better than the first 2. I first started the series when the 2nd one came in through book orders. More boys went for the book than girls. I was the only girl. That's surprising to me. I will read more of the Alex Rider books as they come out.
4,Skeleton Key,"Without reading this book you have not read one of the greatest mysteries ever! Who would have thought that a being a ballboy at Wimbleton could end up with you going on a holiday on which your guardians get killed, and you get kept captive by a mad Russian, General Alexei Sarov?Alex Rider has his life threatened many times and every time I held my breath sure that this was going to be it!This has been said many times, but I couldn't put this book down!"
4,Somewhat complex good plot and great action,"As usual, great action and suspense. Better plot that makes more sense. And it makes more sense for them using Alex Rider this time. The ending is somewhat unsatisfying, but I'll tell you this much. Alex might have found romance. Alex kind of seems like he's corrupted in the end, in a way...a mild mild way. And you also learn to hate Alan Blunt if you haven't already. What lesson does it contain? NEVER JOIN CIA OR ANY OTHER SECRET SERVICE! Lolzers. Jk jk. But this book is probably the best of them all!"
2,Skeleton Key,"I read the first two Alex Rider books and enjoyed them very much. However, in my opinion, the quality of these books has decreased as the series progresses. I have not read the fourth or fifth book, but after my disappointing experience with the third I'm not sure I will.The first book is, by far, in my opinion, the best in the series. It was creative, induvidual, and engaging. The second book was a good enough book, but it lacked some of the creativity of the first- for example, 'Dr. Grief' is not the most imaginative name.The third book was most disappointing. It was not particularly engaging, and the plot was typical of other adventure stories. I hope Mr. Horowitz does Alex Rider his alloted justice in the further books of the series."
4,Lots of fun--different from other Austen-centered works,"""The Friendly Jane Austen"" was well-written and, most of all, great fun. I chose not to give it 5 stars because some of the analysis of Austen's work is rather silly (i.e. reading 20th-century mindsets into 18th-19th century literature--claiming Emma has homosexual feelings for Harriet Smith). Also, because Jeremy Northam deserves at least 4 ""E""s on the ""Elton Vulgarity Scale"" for his uncouth comment about Emma! He may be right about her, but was the obscenity really necessary! While I thought some of the sexual analysis was ridiculous, it was interesting to learn that some people actually interpret Austen in this way."
4,A fun and educational read,This book has given me a greater appreciation for Jane Austen and her novels. It is a fun and educational read. I especially love the quizzes. I highly recommend this book to all Jane Austen fans.
2,Eye of the beholder,This film had some good ideas completely ruined by jumpy editing - which was done to make it 'arty'.It involves a vampire and two women; Lucy and Mina (how odd!). The vampire however looks like an old man affected by the plague with a series of red blotches around both eyes that makes one wonder why people would invite this sickly being to dinner - like calling upon Typhoid Mary to attend your party.But back to the 'arty' editing - this only leads to confusion as scences from different stages of the story may actually appear before the event has happened!A muddled mess
4,Shhh! Mustn't talk about this topic!,"Examines the history of the growth of racism in Islamic culture, from near zero around the the time of Muhmmad, to much much higher levels later."
5,Axel's Boogie Woogie,"If you enjoy Boogie Woogie, this album is a must. Axel plays a representative range of classical titles and has a lightness of touch which is rare. His variations on a theme are a delight, especially his 10 minute masterpiece version of 'Roll 'Em Pete'.Buy this CD while it is still available, or forever regret not doing so!"
2,Editor and proofreaders badly needed,"This book is informative and it would have been a good book if it were not for the innumerable mistakes of all types and degrees of seriousness, not to mention the writing style. I do not understand how a professional can publish a book in a language other than their own and not have it proofread and edited by a professional LINGUIST. A **professional linguist**, --(an English language native working in the Chinese>English pair)-- would have charged, at most, 7 to 10 cents per word. Is that too much to get a good book out to the public? The help from a husband has certainly been far from enough. The book is written using very short sentences and the style is, in general, linguistically childish. It is also full of unnecessary repetitions. I think an 8 year old can write better than this. I returned the book. Fortunately Amazon allows 7 days to return an ebook for the Kindle."
4,"I like Wen Mei Yu's book ls slightly better, but this is a fine intro to Lian Gong","One of the strengths of Lian Gong Shr Ba Fa is that it is the sort of exercise system that actually can be learned from the printed page if you are reasonably well coordinated and are good at learning from books. Even without a teacher, you can get major benefits from practice on your own.This book is a clear, well done presentation of the exercises. Anyone interested in learning the system would get a good start from this book. I would only recommend Wen Mei Yu's version over this one because a) WMY's book explicitly announces that it is a Lian Gong with its title on the cover, and B) the layouts, photographs and book design are somewhat more effective and pleasing to my eye, and c) the accompnaying instructional text is a bit clearer and more helpful to the beginner.But if you want to get started, and you see this book on the stands, don't hesitate to get it and get started."
4,Great product but was too much for my scalp,This is a great product but ended up being too heavy for my scalp which made my scalp itch and flake up.
4,BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL...,"I recently bought this book at a science fiction convention in Tornonto, Canada. Because it was a sequel to Hugo Gernsback's Ralph 124 C41+, I almost didn't read it (since I did not like the original). Boy am I glad I changed my mind! This book was really great. It was full of surprises. It's a book that I'm sure I'll read again and again!"
3,Collection of Sondheim Songs,"I bought this CD for one song only, ""Losing my Mind"" the sound is not the best as it appears to be a ""live"" recording."
3,A collector's item,"If you've ever wanted to hear ""Send in the Clowns"" sung in 4/4, Cleo Laine's rendition is your lucky day. Stephen Collins' affecting ""Sorry-Grateful"" is well worth hearing, as Julie Andrews' tender ""Like it Was,"" but George Hearn's strained ""Too Many Mornings"" should have gone into the 'discard' pile."
2,Hunk of Junk,"This thing didn't have the sucking power I thought it would. I only bought it cause it was safer than using the vacuum. Better to use canned air than this silly thing. I think its in my closet, and that was right after I bought it."
1,Worthless,"This product gives a bad name to Metro, who has some very capable electronics ""vacuums"" (some of them only blow). my work ordered 2 of these by accident instead of better models and these arent much better than the novelty USB vacuums you can find for $5"
1,"Doesn't suck, or blow.","Wasn't exactly what we'd hoped for... not often we get to say this, but we didn't like it because it doesn't really suck. *grins*We tried both battery and plugged in, and couldn't get it to pick up ANYTHING at all. Couldn't get it to blow very much, either. It sits in our closet, worthless, while we continue to use compressed air cans."
2,Not powerful enough,"Neither the vacuum or the blower is powerful enough to dust a computer. When I tried it on my keyboard, no crumbs were picked up. The vacuum had essentially no power. I recommend using a CO2 cartridge based blower instead."
1,The little vacuum that can't,"I was hoping to buy a small handheld vacuum for my office and computer hardware (keyboads, air inlets, and what have you). However, the DataVac has so little power, even after a full charge, that it's next to useless. I can't recommend it."
1,Look Elsewhere,"Look elsewhere for your computer-vacuuming needs. While a great concept, this vacuum falls short in the sucking-factor."
1,computer vacuum,"The metro vacuum DVR-1 is very nice looking. As a toy, it is very attractive. However, I found its functionality to be very desirable. Its vacuum part is very weak and one can barely feel it has any power at all. The air blower is proportinally stronger but still not that great. It is certainly much less powerful that the regular cans. I bought three of them I am sorry I did."
1,Walmart Bowls Outlasted,"I received these as a wedding present and was very excited because I've always had good luck with Kitchenaid brand kitchen products. These bowls, however, are one product you shouldn't waste your money on! I had a similar set at the time by Walmart (which I still have). After less than 6 months of having and using these (at least 3x/wk), I found one cracked, one chipped on the pour spout, and the other one is becoming discolored. I'm super disappointed with this particular product and would encourage you not to waste your money, and go with a Walmart or Target brand equivalent instead. More for you money and it outlasts--my Walmart brand ones (which I get FOUR of for less than this price) have outlasted my Kitchenaid bowls (and I've had my Walmart ones for over 6 years now--only one has become slightly discolored). Good luck--hope this helps save you some money!"
2,bad for kitchen aide brand,"I absolutely LOVE Kitchen Aid products, but this one honestly disappoints me. I have the red set. When mixing a batter, I noticed little pieces of red in the batter. The plastic chips off when mixing with an electric mixer. Not a big deal if you don't mind eating plastic or having bits of plastic visible to those eating it. If buying these bowls, I recommend getting a mixer with silicone guards on the spatulas or just not buying these bowls period. Come on Kitchen Aid!!!"
3,A little too small,"I really don't get the point of small mixing bowls- especially when you're offering two sizes, one should be smallish and the other should be quite a bit substantially bigger. I bought this to presoftend butter in the microwave o make cake batter mixing a one-bowl operation but frankly the large bowl is too small to make vigorous hand mixing (yes, I still hand mix) of a full batch of batter not very clean or fun."
2,Great Concept But Too Flimsy & Pricey,"I bought one to see if I liked it. I agree this is a great idea, but the relatively thin plastic will surely crack if used much for travel. Even if used only at home, it is a pricey item if you have lots of ties as I do. I'd purchase dozens more if the price came down a bit (maybe $3.60 or so), or they made a travel version that will withstand constant packing and unpacking in tightly stuffed suitcases. I'd pay more for that."
2,Keeps ties wrinkle-free ... before it cracks open,Your ties do arrive wrinkle-free but the plastic is too thin and chintzy so the roller cracks after enough use. This is particularly true since ties have been thicker for the past few years.What they need to do is (1) make this thing with a higher quality plastic and (2) maybe a larger circumference. I'm giving this one a 2 but it could easily be a 5.
5,"I liked it so much, I became a promoter!","This CD is incredible! With that 50's & 60's feel, you can't help but snap your fingers to this music. The only way to describe the feeling of the album is FUN! The song, ""Wedding Day"" is sure to be a hit with DJ's nation-wide. It's a must have for every DJ collection. Buy it!"
5,"Love it, can dance and sing along with the Del Souls!","Just heard the CD and love it. It's the 60's again! Finally, fun music that I can dance to and sing along with The DEL SOULS. My favorites: PAINT THE MOON and I'LL BE GOOD TO YOU. Hope to see them at our State Fair!"
1,I don't like the movie .,"I already send the movie back. so I rented ""The Departed"" from Netflix so it was very volience,"
4,"Great Movie, But...","Is it too much to ask people not to give away the ending in their reviews. I happen to have seen the movie prior to reading the previous review by Donna, but she would have spoiled it if I had not. Use a little common sense."
3,Not Scorsese's Best,"The first third was poor, then things began to pick up a little, and the acting of DeCaprio, Damon and Nicholson was very good - yes Nicholson actually was able to step out of his own ""Jackness"" and enmesh himself in the roll - but the tacked on, silly ending should have been changed.****Spoiler Alert****I didn't read the book (if there was one), but the way the DeCaprio character was killed off was stupid, and the film should have just ended with him arresting Matt Damon. It's not that I needed to have a ""happy ending"" to the film, its that the other crooked cop on Costello's payroll seemed like a throw-in to the film to add an emotional jolt to moviegoers who had not engaged the first 2 1/2 hours of the movie.****Spoiler End****I have been watching Martin's fllm's for over 3 decades, and Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Casino, etc. tower over this one. But then again, the MPAA did nominate Babel for best picture, so maybe tastes are dumbing down these days..."
2,NOT Oscar worthy,"I can't believe this film won as best picture over FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS and BABEL. I gave it two stars for superb acting. Although the story line was good, all the cussing and killing got aggravating after awhile. I WAS glad Whalberg killed Damon in the end. I hate it when the bad guy wins."
3,Three oscars too much,"This was a good mob movie. Very intense and edgy. Good acting by most of the cast (though Jack Nicholson was a bit too over). But I have been more impressed by other Scorcese movies. The plot has some flaws, the film is long (and has some boring moments) and all the violence starts to become banal. Conclusion : Oscar for best director OK, but best movie, best adapted screenplay and best editing is too much flattery. There were better candidates."
2,"Great Movie, Lousy DVD",I am a big fan of this movie. Great story. Great acting. Great dialogue. Not much to say about this movie that hasn't been said. What does need to say is that the quality of the DVD during the first twenty minutes is inexcusable. The scene early on in the movie in which Leonardo DiCaprio talks with Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg looks as if it's a VHS copy of a VHS copy. I don't know if this was intended or not but it does look horrible. You've been warned.
5,The Departed,"Excellent movie! There are so many twists and turns, this movie will keep you in your seat, even viewing it at home. The ending was awesome--you never see it coming."
5,An instant classic,"The Departed was a classic Scorsese film. It conatains undercover, violence, language, excellent lighting, and fantastic cinematography. Scorsese proves once again that he is director who deserves an oscar. He has never won and this could be the one. Best movie of all time!!!!!"
2,Overated Movie,"I can not see why Scorsese won an Oscar for this movie. I mean I like Scorsese's other movies especially ""Goodfellas"", but this movie was not very good. The whole plot of the movie is interesting but the way the movie was made really did not work very well. The weird background music and the unnecessary cursing and tension between Mark Wahlberg's and Leonardo DiCaprio's character really made this movie hard to watch. I also dislike the fact that these Irish mafia guys are never really established as mafia guys. You don't see any really interesting stuff going on with these Irish mob guys. If you are the type of person that likes cool gangster movies you will be disappointed when you see this film. I really tried to like this movie but,I found myself waiting for it to be over. This has been the worst recent movie I have seen."
4,Memorable movie,"The Departed is definitely worth your time. The acting is well done and the plot is interesting and suspenseful. The ending of this movie is shocking and and leaves the you with the same shocked feeling as movie endings such as ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Mystic River"". You will not be disappointed."
3,Crooked Cops,"A long movie. Pretty good until the last half hour. Then it's like, ""How do we end this thing?""Ending seems too twisty and contrived. Could have been a four star with a more logical ending."
3,The Departed (Widescreen Edition) DVD,"A watchable film, which--in my opinion--doesn't even come close to the outstanding Donnie Brascoe. The widescreen DVD is very good."
5,great movie buy this 1,a movie than stands out and should be at a 5star standing its a good movie plain and simple go out and get this one today its enjoyable!!!
4,When Jack Nicholson rules the hood...,"All I can say is... wow.Martin Scorsese's The Departed is an action movie that builds in intensity right through to the end. Two men, both products of the underbelly of Boston, end up going to police academy. One, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), flourishes, but remains beholden to crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The other, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), goes deep undercover to get the goods on Costello.Their lives weave around each other, until eventually they find themselves actively searching for one another, with fatal consequences.Jack Nicholson makes for a mean gangster, and transitions between a friendly ""uncle-type"" and an emotionless killer without missing a beat.This is a movie that will have you wishing you owned stock in one of those fake blood companies prior to production. Be warned."
2,Departed,"Why was everybody so hyped about this movie? My wife and I borrowed it from a neighbor who raved about it and we were both very disappointed. I was bored during most of the movie. I can't believe people thought it was so great. My Mom bought it and has watched it 5+ times. I could hardly sit through one viewing, wondering when it was going to end. Over-rated!"
4,It's That Good,"Wow! I had forgotten how fun a movie can be. This is Scorsese's best since Goodfellas. There, I said it. And it's true. It's a guy's flick that the ladies can enjoy, namely because of Matt Damon and Leo DiCaprio. The performances are great all around - Alec Baldwin, Nicholson and Wahlberg deserve much props. The dialogue is macho, hilarious, smart, filthy. The storyline twists and turns. Good cops, bad cops, undercover cops, gangsters and thieves. Oh, my! The film takes the whole cop movie genre to all new heights. Forget all the CSI and NYPD Blue piffle - it's boring; we've seen it all before. The Departed! If you've forgotten how fun an experience at the movies can be, run out and see The Departed. Nuff said."
2,Too Violent for Me,"Because this is a movie about violent people, the violence depicted is hardly gratuitous, but it made the movie unwatchable for me. ""The Departed"" promises a satisfyingly intricate story, and I regret that I could not give the movie its due."
2,Very Disappointing,"This won Best Picture?! Did no one see The Queen, Dream Girls, or even Little Miss Sunshine? This movie was filled with cliches and retreads of every other mobster film. The only thing saving this is Leonardo's and Matt's performance."
2,The Confused,"Fine acting aside, the story is confusing as anything. Adding to the confusion is casting three similar characters (Damon, DiCaprio, Wahlberg) with three hunk leading men blondes and you try keeping track of who is who. Overrated and clearly merited only as a lifetime achievement award for Martin Scorsese."
2,The Farted,"I wasn't feeling this film. The plot was a bit confusing, and it just seemed like a typical cop movie with all the same gangsters and police coruption scandals we've all seen in hundreds of law and order and csi tv shows. Martin Scorcese has done better films like ""After Hours"", ""Casino"" and ""The Aviator"". At least those films were original and quirky. ""The Departed"" was ORDINARY!! Get it out of here!"
5,Scorsese at his best....,"I don't care what anyone says. This is one of his best films. The fact that it is his highest grossing film is equally deserving for him.Just the way it was shot, edited, scored (with some good pop tunes, especially from the Dropkick Murphy's) and the brilliant performances from Nicholson (Has he ever given a bad one? I think not) to Dicaprio ( I think he is a pretty good actor)Yes the picture is a little slow in the middle, but that is narrative transition for you, and yes it is violent and full of bad language, but thats normal for Marty's work.I've seen this movie twice in the theater and I already ordered the two disc DVD, and come oscar night, if it doesn't win for director and picture, I am going to scream."
3,"Entertaining, but overrated","I was very excited to see this movie and had to wait a week before renting it because the video store was sold out. After seeing it I was dissapointed with it. The movie keeps your interest with a great cast and a story about an investigation into an Irish mobster in Boston.Performances by Nicholson, Sheen and DiCaprio are great. However Wahlberg did not deserve an Oscar nomination and the female lead generates no chemistry with Damon or DiCaprio. The storyline keeps the movie moving well enough, but there are too many cliches in it. And seriously, how could Nicholson's character not figure out who the rat in his crew is when the police investigation doesn't seem to gain any ground until after DiCaprio starts working for him? Even The Simpsons made fun of that.Overall the movie is entertaining to see once or twice, but did not deserve Best Picture."
4,Why are they always picking on the Southies?,"I don't write spoilers. There are some real believability problems w/the way they play out the plot. To be honest, I don't feel Leo brought his A game to this one. His interpretation of a Southie needs work. Despite the flaws, It's an enjoyable film. You can pick it up cheap. You'll be glad you did. Not a bad film by any stretch."
4,Liked it,I think it is stupid I have to write 18 words to rate a movie. I think the stars should be enough.
4,"Review of the movie, ""The Departed""",The forces of good and evil are at again. The end of the movie leaves you wondering who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Crime doesn't pay and in the end they find you out.
5,action flick!!!,"Incredible tale of ""protect and serve"" gone mad and the choices made that result in way too much carnage of which the director is well known."
3,Who's Who,"It was very confusing to distinguish between adult characters as to whator to whom the leads were attached, i.e. who really were the good guys and the bad guys."
5,Good movie with twist!,Awsome movie bunch of great actors if you love action this movie has got it has crazy twist but great movie!
1,The Departed,"This movie??? Well there is no other way to say it other than it sucks, and that is with a capital S. Everyone is making a big deal about beacuse Scorsese has his name pinned to it. (BIG DEAL). Leonard DiCaprio could not play a good bad guy if his life depended on it, Stick to sinking ships Leo. Do not waste an evening of your life watching this garbage, But hey this is just one mans opion LOL."
3,"OK movie, but not best picture in my opinion","This was a pretty good movie but I wasn't wowed by it or anything. Especially since the story is not original and The Departed is actually a remake of a Hong Kong film that came out first.Also the Boston accents were annoying. Since we know these actors don't normally speak with an accent, having them twalk like thwat seemed very contrived.I bought this DVD thinking it was going to be great but was disappointed. I don't feel like I want to own it, I should have rented it instead."
2,More Ugliness from Scorsese,"""Could it have been any nastier?"" Those were my words upon walking out of the theater after seeing this raunchy, bloody mess of a movie that could just as well have been called ""Gangs of Boston."" The killings got so absurd toward the end that many in the audience broke out laughing. Scorsese decides all the main characters have to die a grisly death and ends with a nihilistic image that I suppose perfectly ties together the nihilism of this film. Jack Nicholson's performance aside, there's very little of anything to recommend in this excessive, overdone, failed attempt at a thriller. The plot twists get preposterous, and the relentless nastiness gets insufferable after about an hour."
1,trash,"I think you would have to be deranged to like this kind of movie ( by current count there is only about 500 of you in the whole world so that's a relief maybe ) .Scorcese's movies have always been ultra-violent but this one takes the cake . I think 15 years ago , this would have been shocking . Brains are blown out left and right and blood is splattering like cans of red paint ala Tarantino . Totally nuts .Was this actually a comedy spoof of mob movies ? It would explain a lot .The dialogue , plot and acting is awful . F this and F that , ""... i gave you the wrong address but you showed up at the right one ... tell me why I didn't say anything ?"" He dies . Give me a break . And its all for nothing because the ending is garbage anyway ."
1,Skip it....see the original,"The good: Jack Nicholson/Martin ScorceseThe bad: Everything elseListen, don't waste your time seeing this movie. The original ""Infernal Affairs"" is the masterpiece. This is another trumped up, ""over-hollywooded"" remake of a great Asian flick. Let's face it, DiCaprio trying to pull it off as a tough guy? Yeah right. He's still a weenie. And all of the extremely fake Boston accents made me want to pour cement in my ears.I'm a movie fan. I watch movies for the entertainment, and comparing the original to this version is like comparing apples to dog s**t.Remember, see Infernal Affairs, not this lame remake."
3,id gotta say this film looks pretty good,now i havent seen this film yet because it didnt come out but it looks pretty good martin scorses is using jack nicholson for the first time and i have to say im looking forward to seeing it
2,Best Picture Nod? Good grief!,"A convoluted, unnecessarily foul-mouthed (Wahlberg, a usually likable performer, is nominated for a one dimensional sewer-mouthed twit?), and bloated, unengaging film (until the final hour) is sloppy seconds compared to Scorcese's earlier work. Accents come and go (hello, Jack? Martin?), the love interest is pointless/underdeveloped, and the Shakespearean ending, while jolting, is ultimately ridiculous. Just in case you miss the heavy-handed message, watch for the rodent in the final scene.... Trim the run time, axe a few characters, focus the conflict, develop character (no, profanity doesn't develop character) and then release a director's cut."
2,Pedestrian,"The parallel story of a police informant within a Boston gang and a gang informant within the police. Well filmed and generally acted well, this film is nonetheless over-rated. The plot is excessively complex with realism sacrificed in the interest of making the stories of the 2 informants parallel. This allows a lot of well done cross-cutting between plot lines but strains credulity. Some of the dialogue verges on self-parody. Most of the principals and supporting cast do well but Jack Nicholson's performance as an evil Nietzschean egoist is rank scenery chewing. The French Connection this isn't."
2,The Overrated. The Mediocre. The Not Worth Spending Money On To Actually Buy The DVD.,"Leonardo Dicaprio... scarey? Believable as a gangster? Come on. This film is an overrated farce. Jack Nicholson doesn't even come close to the horror inflicted by Whitey Bulger. And yes I know that this is based on a Japanese film and only ""loosely"" based on Whitey. Mass-holes like Marky Mark, Matt Damon, etc. can't even remember how to speak Southy anymore. But beyond my nitpicking this film is just ok. If you think it's better than Pan's Labyrnth or Babel you need to get your head checked. This should not be in the same category as The Godfather."
1,The Departed,"Hi jsut wanted to let everyone know as l love in australai the format of the dvd does not work in australia format or the overseas format, as it is dissapointing to see that this was the case when l placed the dvd in the revcorder, l went to borrow it and thought it was good to the point of being crime thriller suspense, btu overall the story of loyalty and friendship !"
5,The Departed,The Departed is a great movie. I definitely recommend buying this. I bought my fiance the two disc series for Valentine's Day and he loved it.
5,Stunning work by Scorcese,"The Departed may initially look like your typical cops and robbers suspense, but Scorcese knocks it out of Fenway Park this time round with Boston as its interminably seedy backdrop. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon skillfully hold fast to their southie accents, lending real authenticity to the plot, yet it is Jack Nicholson who steals the performance du jour as the villian extraordinaire. My only criticism is regarding the weak(er) ending, leading me to believe they weren't sure how to do it or pull it off any other way. A Beautifully woven story of two guys trying to make it in the police force; two separate worlds that eventually collide - such brilliant writing makes this so much more than a gansta film. A must see."
4,violence du jour,"It's brutal, it's honest, it's inventive, it's intriguing. The cast is incredible from Leonardo DiCaprio to Jack Nicholson to Matt Damon to Mark Wahlberg. I'm still convinced Leo did a better job in Blood Diamond, but here his acting is equally superb. The directing is great - Martin Scorsese at his bloodiest and best."
3,"Just good, not great","I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Let me first say that I didn't dislike this movie, but I didn't LOVE it either. I think Mark Wahlberg was outstanding in this movie and hands down my favorite character. The problem that I did have was the fact that certain parts of the plot were not believable. Specifically the fact that Jack Nicholson's character couldn't figure out who the mole was AND the fact that there were numerous moles. I didn't buy it, hence my disappointment. But, if you have some time, I'd say watch it anyway."
2,They should have gone quicker,I was very disappointed with this movie. The sound could have been a lot better. The action was very pridictable and slow. Give it a miss.
5,Really nice metal case and Bonus Features.,"The case on this two disc set is really nice. It is bluish great metal. I really enjoyed the special features and love the widescreen format. The only negative thing I can see is that inside it has a booklet but it has no information about the movie. It is just picture cards with Leonardo Dicaprio,Matt Damon and so on."
5,"Masterful, suspenseful, and just plain amazing.","I loved this movie! It has a great story, and the acting is top-notch. You can really feel the tension. This movie is just plain amazing and if you don't like it there is something wrong with you."
5,AMAZING!!!!,I loved this film! Absolutely fabulous! Great cast! Edge of your seat suspense! Very highly recommended!
1,"What a disappointment, what a waste!!!! :(","My wife and I purchased this movie with the expectation that it would be a great movie, a fun couple of hours. It was not. It was simply boring and tiresome. We have all come to expect a great deal from Scorsese. While these expectations are high and maybe unfair, they are fairly earned as Scorsese has provided great movie after great movie. With that in mind, one can safely say this was a letdown of epic proportions. It was a just a rehash of Scorsese's previous movies with a helping of ""southie"" accent thrown on top. It was slow and boring. Skip this one, unless you have a few hours and a couple of bucks to kill. Sorry, but it was this bad. Honest!!!!"
3,"Great acting, but the story falters...","Without giving too much away, I found the ending to be needlessly depressing. I know Scorsese likes to make his movies realistic so you're never gonna get the ""happy Hollywood ending"" with him. But this ending went out of it's way to be as unhappy as possible - so much so that it became unrealistic. Think of the ""Goodfellas"" or ""Blow"" endings only with more dead people. It almost seems as though there is no message at the end other than ""everyone dies on both sides of the law."" Great, glad I spent 2 1/2 hours to learn that."
1,NOW I KNOW HOW TO SAY F... WITH PHONY BOSTON ACCENT!,"I CAN'T BELIEVE I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE....UNFORTUNATELY IT CONFIRMS MY BELIEFS OF HOLLYWOOD... THE ACADEMY VOTES FOR REASONS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH QUALITY. OH WELL....IT WAS STRANGE TO LAUGH AT MOMENTS THAT ARE SUPPOSE TO BE HORRIFYING.....BUT AFTER EVERYONE GETS THEIR BRAINS BLOWN OUT CONSTANTLY, IT BECOMES SO CORNY!! SEEING JACK NICHOLSON WITH HIS WONDERFUL FACIAL CONTORTIONS IS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING AND LEONARDO DICAPRIO IS TERRIFIC....."
1,eyesore,"The best that can be said of this eyesore is that it features an all-star cast committed to violence and is one step up from the 2005 academy winner ""Crash."" One viewing is more than enough."
1,Disapointing....,"for such a great cast, nicholson, Dicaprio & Damon this movie sucked the ending sucked the whole thing sucked. and i like all these actors. i don't know why jack signed up for this crappy movie. Leonardo i can see why for not making any nmovies for a long while. and matt who knows. But all in all it was boriing confusing and bad."
1,Don't bother,I started watching this with high hopes but very quickly felt let down and was pressing stop half way through. If you want to see this story done properly then get the original (Infernal Affairs) rather than this pile of trash. Why do English language directors feel they have to dumb down Asian movies when they remake them. To me this goes in the same bin as The Grudge or The ring or just about every remake of a good Foreign language film. I can only hope there isn't an American director out there hoping to remake Pan's Labyrinth.
5,My First HD-DVD,"This is the first movie I watched on my HD-DVD player and I think it was a good choice. I was disappointed in the first couple of minutes with the video as it didn't look that much better than regular DVD. Once they went outside that changed. They skies were clear blue and it looked awesome! The sound was great, gun shots sounded very real. As for the movie, I thought it was very good, but not quiet in the class of Goodfellas."
5,Great Must see OSCAR WINING MOVE OF THE YEAR!,"This is a movie about an inside investigation into the mob in Boston. In the process involving corrupt cops along the way. This is an all star cast that you should not miss.This is a R rated movie and I would say a HARD R movie. Extreme blood, violence and language. Also stay with the movie leaving the room or looking away for any length of time you may loose what is going on from moment to moment. This is action packed from start to finish."
4,One of the better films of 2006.,"The writing, character development and plot were excellent. Leo and cast were absolutely believable in their roles. Although, I must admit I would have liked to have seen Robert DeNiro play the crime boss' role. Him and Scorsese have always made a great combination. I have never really cared for Nicholson's acting and I felt that in some points of the film he was hammin' it up a little too much. Other than that and an unexpected ending this is a good movie to add to you collection when it released on DVD."
4,Uneven but good,"This film confounds me. How can it be so chaotic and uneven and yet still force me to watch again and again.The DiCaprio storyline is pretty flawless, but the Damon storyline fall flat. The idea of this two mirroring each other fails because the tension in Damon's life never reaches the level of DiCaprio's.DiCaprio getting caught means death. Damon getting caught means... maybe jail. Bad yes, but not devastating."
4,What are you going to do?,"I received the dvd promptly but the dvd metal casing was bent and won't close properly because it was damaged during the mailing process. Can't blame the shipper as it was sent in secure packaging, but it appears that the mail forced the dvd packaging into the mailbox in a hurried manner. Dvd itself was in excellent condition, but the point of steelboxes is the casing, so what are you going to do. se la vi."
5,ONE GREAT MOVIE,"I first saw part of this movie on TV. As I said....""saw part"".After seeing about 1/2 hour (the middle of the movie) I knew that I must see all of it. Now that I have seen it in whole, IT IS A MUST FOR ALL THRILLER ENTHUSIESTS. It is one of Leo's finest.Fully receommended to keep you on yhe edge of your seat.John GriffithsSpringfield, OR"
2,Scorsese made this?,"First, Scorsese is a genius. He really is. Watch five minutes of Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Goodfellas and you know it. The Departed is not even close to what he has done before. It's a TV show. Of course, there's Jack Nicholson being JACK. I have to admit that DiCaprio is a great actor, but this isn't really worth the time to watch. It falls short in both narrative and acting."
3,Not everything it's cracked up to be,"I gave this movie 3 stars merely for the acting, which was handled effortlessly. The problems here though exist on many levels:(SPOILERS AHEAD)1. How many cell phone calls does it take until someone notices they are being made? Probably much less than depicted here.2. Why does everyone have to die? Very ridiculous, there were many other ways to finish this movie that would have satisfied many more people. Too many ""Pay It Forward"" endings in a lifetime can really make a person bitter, you know?3. Very hard to follow. Heck, I didn't know they were moles until I read the back of the DVD case halfway through the movie, then I had to explain it to my wife, and we are people who understood Memento the first time through.Should not have won all the awards it got.DUD!"
1,You call that an ending?,"Well, I finally got around to watching this movie; had it sitting on the shelf for years.OK, the plot had some holes and the movie really leaned on cell-phones as an important plot device.But several times I muttered to myself ""what a good movie."" Some really over the top acting by an all-star cast. Lots of tricky movie fun.Then, what, in the last 15 minutes the movie crashed and burned into arch silliness. I mean really dumb. What? Did the scriptwriters run out of paper, or something?Was this really Martin Scorsese? Of ""Goodfellas"" fame? I expected more; much more.Bang, bang, bang, bang. The sound of a painfully bad ending. It really does ruin the movie."
5,Brilliant,"This is one film where Jack Nicholson makes Al Pacino look elusive to be a Mafia Leader, it's very realistic and diferrent than other mafia films where all the killings take place in the end."
4,I liked it a lot!,"Some of the stuff @ the end you just never saw it coming. It kind of reminds me of the ending to Lucky Number Slevin, JUST NOT AS GOOD. Lots of twists. I didn't mind the love triangle between the cops & their psychiatrist lady but it kind of made it distasteful. The ending would have been just as good without Dicaprio's character & the psych chic having a relationship. Anyway - beside all that I was quites surprised I liked the movie that much. Some parts of the storylines we've seen before but oh well. If the script writers were gonna remake a Japanese movie they might as well do a good job."
1,Full of unnecessary vulgar profanity,"Great cast of characters, possibly a good story, wasted with nonstop unnecessary vulgar profanity.Why these great actors would lend their names and reputations to such stuff is beyond me."
1,still waiting,I'm hoping it got mailed out to me - still waiting for it. This is the longest I've waited for anything from Amazon.
1,Foul language spoiled this movie,I got this movie for free when I bought my DVD player and finally sat down to watch it. My husband and I turned it off after about 20 minutes because the language was so horrible. I am not kidding when I say that every other word in this movie is the f word. I have watched so many movies without foul language and they can be just as powerful and entertaining to watch as the the movies with foul language. So why ruin a good story with this language? I wish Hollywood would realize that not everyone speaks this way and that it is offensive.
1,NOT a feel-good movie,"I think my title about sums it up. Do not watch this movie thinking that, despite all the unhappy plot twists in the middle, you'll finish this movie with a smile on your face. You won't."
1,possibly the worst of 2006,I had high hopes for this film. This film is fantastic up until the last 10-15 minutes. It is so anti-climactic that I trully regret paying anything to see it. It's almost as if there were 10 different very interesting ways to end this movie and they picked the worst one possible. Truth be told..if you really MUST see this movie..don't pay money to do it.
4,good not great scorsese. ending and jack almost ruin movie,"the ending to this movie is silly and ridiculous. it's totally implausable. so is jack nicholson's performance. to be believeable his charactor would have to be both frightening and brilliant. as jack plays him he's neither. he's just over the top jack. as usual. nicholson has got to be the most overrated actor in resent memory. he almost ruins this movie. the script has other problems besides the ending as well. a fool would have known leo was the rat but nicholson's charactor can't figure it out. anyway, this is a long movie that's very entertaining (for the most part) until the ridiculous ending. leo has developed into a very good actor and damon ain't bad either. so, if you can put up with jack and the ending it's worth the 15 bucks."
4,Watched this one grinning ear to ear ...,"... at how Scorcese essentially makes a ""Boston Irish"" version of Goodfellas. If you or your parents are from Beantown (or all your cousins, in our case) you will be amazed at how the actors capture the accents and feel of Boston.And if you like films about the Mob with dense plotting and double (maybe triple?) crosses, ""The Departed"" will definitely provide nearly three hours of lively entertainment. Sure there are a fair number of improbable plot twists but that is to be expected with a Hong Kong action flick remake.Watch this one on a Saturday night when you have time to enjoy it and hold on for the ride."
2,The Departed,"Amazon's service was 5 star, but the product itself, ""The Departed"" was a disappointment because the continual use of the ""F"" word. Was unnecessary and ruined the film."
5,Stellar performances,"Not for the squeamish, but the everyone in The Departed put in such a stellar performance...several were up for Academy Awards...that it was worth cringing a bit at times. Surprise ending. Loved this movie!"
2,problems,I just got back my x-a-2 Toshiba from being repaired and it will not play this movie on the hi def. side.It throws out an error code about half way through the movie.I have had this happen before and using some lite rubbing compound seems to help on all the other ones with this defect but not this one.Yes the movie is brand new.It will play on the regular side.There is no sense calling Toshiba they are no help.Then again what can i expect for 9.00 dollars.Can anyone explain the end to me? The guy was shot in the head.How did he live?
1,"What a stupid, stupid movie!","I only give it a single star because I can't go any lower! What is wrong with Hollywood? I can't believe they couldn't find something else to vote for. I can't believe I sat there for that long only to watch something that unworthy. Oh, if you like seeing brains flying, blood spraying, cussing every other second, then by all means rent or buy this movie. You will be thrilled. If you are looking for a good movie keep looking!"
1,Pure Garbage,"What a waste of time, money, and talent. If its Murder you want well this one has plenty of blood and guts to fill the bill. Sorry I wasted my time viewing such trash!"
3,Cartooning on a big budget,"The Departed has some great performances and interesting twists in the story. It is also self-indulgent and overblown.For most of the film the story and characters pull you along and keep you interested. There are individual scenes of absolute brilliance, but I had a nagging feeling that I had been fed this stuff before by Scorcese - ad nauseum.The last 1/8 of the film is so utterly ridiculous and cartoonish that I found the whole thing to be unsatisfying. I think that Scorcese has gone as far as he can in trying to be the tough guy by making films about tough guys.Goodfellas and Raging Bull will always serve as a pretty fair legacy,no?"
2,"How did this get ""Best Picture""?","Great story, excellent acting, but....what ruined this movie for me was the excessive use of profanity and vulgarity; I think I heard enough of the ""F"" word enough to last me a lifetime (two and three times in a sentence is a little too much for me). I should have walked out of the movie, but the intrigue and suspense kept me there. It this REALLY how the Boston police speak?? This is a very dark movie."
1,Poorest Quality DVD Ever Purchased,"This seller sent me two defective products. The first DVD froze and would not play. I returned it and the seller provided me with another copy free of charge. The second copy was equally as defective as the first, freezing after 45 minutes. Very poor quality DVD and I would not make any other DVD purchases from this seller."
5,Wonderful Movie,Awesome is all I can say. This movie keeps you plastered to your seat. The ending is absolutely unexpected.
1,As I have gotten older I find myself liking this kind of movie less and less,"The acting in this movie was great! Especially Alec Baldwin and Leonardo Dicaprio! I do think Jack Nicholson has gone to the well one too many times with the whole loose cannon thing. I like him better in quieter roles where he actually gets to act, such as ""The Pledge"", and ""As Good As It Gets"". He was TERRIFIC in both of those movies.Back to ""The Departed"". This isn't a badly done movie but after it was over all I could think of was ""Why did I just watch this?"" Was I entertained? With that much violence, I sure hope not. Did the movie make me think of anything new or feel anything new? NAH. It was just violence. It seems like a lot more movies are just that; violence!I am not against violence in a movie when it does something or moves the story or even makes a point about something, but this was just violence.This is just my opinion but it is something I have been thinking a lot about lately."
3,"good acting , so so script.","For sure only the cast and famous director made this movie somehow successful, otherwise the script was not original and reminded me of one of the old western in which heroes & villains all end up dead.acting of jack nicoulson was over exaggerated and for sure was notone his best.I was just waiting for the movie to end asap."
3,pretty Good Film,"Martin Scorsese should get his long overdue Oscar,but this Fim isn't on par with His best overall works,but he is overdue. the Acting&overall pacing was Good in this film. the story was pretty easy to pick up on. it ran a bit too long&the Music didn't really run with the film as have past Scorsese films.very watchable film&has some interesting moments."
3,great acting but its not an original film,"Yes the acting is really good but this movie is nearly a complete copy of the 2002 Chinese film Infernal Affairs,I didnt even know this until i started wathing it,that was really disapointing to me,they are both really,really great movies but this one is still a copy of a great film in Infernal Affairs.I would have givin The Departed atleast 4 stars if it wouldnt have been a copy though,so still check it out,but check out Infernal Affairs first since it is the original."
2,Not that good,"Based upon the Hong Kong film, MoGanDou/WuJianDao/Infernal Affairs, I have to say that if you've seen the HK version, this version is not as good. No where near as good. A lot of scenes got skipped over or fastforwarded through and as such the build up wasn't as good. The ended was padded to become softer too and as such made the movie end on a much, tackier note. Not worth it. Infernal Affairs was much better."
1,Does Plagarism Count when American Movies Copy Foreign Films?,"How is it that an American film director, who's wins a ""Best Director"" Oscar for a film that he Plagarized from a Hong Kong film get so much credit as being ""Great"" and a ""Master"" ???? I'm sure that when he won the Oscar, he wanted to make it sound like this film was an original piece of work. He didn't even mention that he COPIED THE ENTIRE IDEA from ""Infernal Affairs"" during his acceptance speech.I guess that American critics would call this as a ""remake"", but the entire idea of the movie was from Hong Kong. However, if a foreign film company were to copy an American film idea, there would be law suits that the foreign company has plagarized an American idea. Where's the justice? What ever happened to the rights of others? Is there some kind of double standard?"
3,Stars everywhere you look.,"Granted the movie was tense. Dennis Hopper was in his classic weirdness mode. That in itself does not make the whole movie. The movie itself, seemed to me, just another version of the 'Bourne' series, or one of the 'Law & Order' TV episodes. It is a great rental movie, but not a 'keeper'."
4,Great Movie,"Love this movie, it looks great in HD. If you are looking for a great movie to watch make it this one."
4,Thumbs up,"Great Story, Great Acting. One of the few good movies Hollywood has put out. Would recommend this movie Highly to anybody."
5,It's very real,"I doubt I would watch this film more than once, but it's one of the best acted films I've seen. The cuts between scenes are rough and didn't play well at all on my MacIntosh. At points, I had to use the menu and just play scene-by-scene. The documentary portion of the set is very interesting, but I do not believe that any of the deleted scenes would have made a better film."
2,Big let-down.,"I heard so many good things about this movie so I figured it had to be good, so I bought it. Then the problem came when I was watching it, monotony. For a movie labeled as suspense it didn't have very much. Aside from top-rate acting, this movie suffers from a number of issues regarding the speed at which the story moves, such as: slow, slow, and slow. On top of the story running slow, the ending was the most pitiful attempt I've seen in ages. Anyways, I watch a lot of movies, and this one does not show up on must-watch radar in my opinion.2/5 stars for Jack Nicholson only."
2,Disappointed,"How Scorsese won for this and not Goodfellas is beyond me. Unless it was a ""make-up"" Oscar. This movie tries too hard to be like other movies. From the beginning long shot with Nicholson voice-over to the Joker-esque facial musings, Matt Damon sounding like he just stepped off the Good Will Hunting set, it was just kind of sad. There's some spirited acting but that didn't help the story. There was nothing scary or disturbing about this picture. Maybe I'm just desensitized but Marty should have stopped at Casino."
2,I'm weighing the pros and cons. Cons are winning big time!,"What's good about the movie: the acting (except for poor old Leo who is playing poor old Leo, AGAIN!) and Boston sceneryWhat's bad about the movie: pretty much everything else, especially the plot but also the characters,Why did it win? Was it because they wanted to give it to Scorsese?"
2,Meh ... didn't satisfy in the end,"I just spent 2.5 hrs of my life getting cursed at, for a movie that, in the end, was just ""meh"". Slow to get started, picked up in the middle, but fizzled in the end. Nothing all that exciting, only a few small ""reveals"", and pretty unsatisfying. Skip it."
5,The Departed HD-DVD,Great Movie with positive reviews on its picture and audio quality. Great price. 'Nuff said.
2,Sucky Script!,"I am not a fan of DiCaprio, but I have to admit he was good in this movie; Matt Damon was great as well, Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg not so much.I agree with the comment that there are some disturbing anti-black nuances at the start of the movie.The script has so many holes that I do not know where to start.The ending of the movie is pointless and begs a question; did Scorsese see this movie before he unleashed against the world?Can someone please tell me why Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) kill Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) in the end? It can't be vengeance since he is apparently a mole. What happened to the yellow envelope given by Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) to the psychologist? How did the third mole know that Billy Costigan was the mole inside the mob and why didn't he tell Costello?I agree that Scorsese made a couple of good movies, but it's been downhill since then.I gave it two stars because I think that someone else may give it a single star and we can added it up."
1,Boring,We found this movie boring and confusing. It was difficult to tell who was what and frankly my dear I did not give a damn. The best part was the end when everybody got shot. It would have been a better movie if those scenes had taken place in the begining and I didn't have to watch the rest of it.
1,Waste of time and money,"This film is supposed to be about 120 minutes long, but seems to be several hours. I have tried many times to watch it, but can't get past the 3 hour mark. It's like a bad dream that keeps starting up again, after you thought it was over. It is cheap manipulation of what we paid for."
3,Infernal Affairs Hollywood-ized,Although this movie remains more or less true to the original I still found it was not as goodas Infernal Affairs especially during the last 20 min or so where I felt it paled in comparison to itspredecessor. In spite of that I did find that I enjoyed it and would recommend it.The movie runs for 2 1/2 hours but the starring cast does make that time go by quickly.
1,Great movie - ghastly DVD transfer.,"I ordered this the night of the Oscars. I will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy. There wasn't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging. It looks like a bad VHS transfer. I should have returned it, but it would've been more trouble than it was worth.I thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be - but unfortunately, in my case, I have to add: buyer beware."
5,Must see!,This movie is amazing and even better the second time around. Great action and possibility of a sequel. Definitely Oscar worthy!
2,Is that it?,"So much excitement waiting for the dvd to arrive, hands sweaty ripping open the packet. Oh joy! 2 and a bit hours of cinematic pleasure. Er no. Wahlberg acts like wood, Jack like prime ham. Story and direction flow like a river of swearing mud. Oh dear - 75 minutes in and nobody wants to carry on watching.Raging Bull, Casino, Good Fellas, Kings of Comedy - a strain of gold and those were the Oscars not this and ""the Gangs of New York"". I can only assume your other reviewers have been watching a different film"
4,Worth the purchase,"Great movie, NOT one of Scorsche's best but it is still really good. Dont belive all the awards hype, this movie is good, possibly really good, but not great. Espcially not best picture great. But if you like Scorsche and you are into his style of movie making check this movie out, its really entertaining and worth the money"
4,The Departed,"There was a lot of violence in this movie, but that wasn't a surprise because of the background on the story. The acting was superb for all the major characters, and it won an Oscar for best picture and best director. I wanted to see it anyway because of the cast, but all of the Oscar nominations it got added to that, and it was not a disappointment."
2,COULD NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE,"This movie was one of the worse that I have tried to watch. The f word seemed to be the key focus of the script. I was hoping that this would stop and the plot would soon take over. If the f word was left out this would have been a silent movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has any morals. No, after about 1/2 hour of this DVD I pushed the stop button and turned on a basketball game on my set. If this is what the academy considers the best picture of the year they need to rethink and consider that hollywood should clean up the dialogue of the film industry."
2,Is that all Scorsese could do?,"I don't know why Marty wanted to do a re-make of the Infernal Affair.The first half of the movie was actually pretty decent. Unfortunately, the second half was a complete copy of IA part 1 with a bit of the IA part 3 injected in, down to a lot of the direct translation of the original dialogue. The ending for Matt Damon was a complete joke.Get the original part 1 and 2, but forget about part 3."
1,Great Film But The Blu-Ray Disc Is A Rip-Off,my rating is specifically for the blu-ray disc not the film. when the 2disc regular dvd set came out March 2007 the film was on disc#1 and all theextras were on disc#2. when the HD-DVD came out one of the extras wasmissing- the 90min. career spanning doc. about Scorsese from his first filmWHO'S THAT KNOCKING AT MY DOOR? thru THE AVIATOR. i hoped that the doc. wouldbe on the blu-ray disc but its missing as well. what gives if the 90min.doc. was on the dvd why not on the blu-ray or for that matter the originalHD-DVD?
4,Very good movie,"Excellent movie. What would you expect with Matt Damon, Norton, Decaprio, Wahlberg and Nickolson. Great action, good story line and suspense. The love scenes could have been more believeable but other than that pretty entertaining."
4,Great movie!,This is a great movie made even better with a 2-disc special edition. The extras are surprisingly interesting for this intense cop drama/thriller.
3,Academy Hands Out Award,"The Award for best movie 2007 went to Scorsese for The Departed . Although I enjoyed some of the performances, lead by Leo...Jack...Marky Mark et cetera...., I felt the movie lacked that Scorsese flare that we are all so used to.Being from BOSTON myself, I'm quite aware of the Bulger case, and this is NOT it. The DVD would have you think so, but The Departed is really based off of the 1st film in the trilogy, ""Infernal Affairs."" This is why I am forced to give this Scorsese film a 3."
2,Blah!!!,"This movie had the potential to be really, really good.. but the director failed to deliver. Whoever wrote the script needs to kick themselves in the nuts. Honestly. I think people like this just because of the big names associated with it, but I really feel like this was a big flop. For one thing, *spoilers* I feel as though the ending was ridiculous. Nearly everyone dies within a 5 minute period. It felt like they kind of just went, ""well.. this movie is getting too long so lets just kill everyone off to wrap it up"". This is the first movie I have ever walked out on. Awful! I hated it."
4,Nice movie,"it's a very nice movie, Di Caprio is a very good actor and it's one of it's best movies. Blu-ray quality it's perfect."
5,The Departed,I am glad I purchased this online. I saved money. It was a good price and came quick. All around good experience!
4,Good but not as good,Not as good as the original Infernal Affairs but it still delivers. The story is pretty much the same with a few differences! The acting is grade A and the blu ray delivers spectacular sound and detail!!! Fans of the film will be pleased. Matt Damon gives and excellent performance. Martin won the Oscar for this film but it's nowhere close to being as good as some of his earlier work.
3,Please read this if you've seen it.,"I wanted to like this film. Before bashing me for having bad taste, keep in mind that Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films. This movie was fantastic up until the end. Every character (which are mostly unlikable) SOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!! was killed off needlessly at the end. Could someone please write a comment as to why it was necessary, then I may edit my review to 4 stars."
3,"For me, not a re-watch","I bought this as a gift, hoping it would fall into the category of movies that one can watch over and over again and enjoy (see, e.g., Harry Met Sally, Ronin, even The Italian Job). For me, it's not. It's more akin to Memento, or even The Sopranos--it holds your interest, a perfectly fine movie, but not likely to be watched repeatedly with pleasure.The acting--great. Jack Nicholson can be whomever he wants, and grown-up Mark Wahlberg and Leonardo DiCaprio earn some respect."
3,We've seen this movie before,"Jack Nicholson is a Boston crime boss, Matt Damon is part of his organizatin but is also a cop. DiCaprio is a cop working undercover as a member of Nicholson's gang. DiCaprio gains Nicholson's trust and is instructed to look for a rat in the gang which happens to be himself. The cops know someone among them is working for Nicholson, so Damon is tapped to find him which again happens to be himself. Along the way, they both fall in love with the same woman. And in the end I didn't care about any of it.We've seen this movie before, done better, and by the same director. How many mob movies are too many? If you're going to do one, there has to be something special about it and The Departed is ordinary. I enjoyed it, but I never need to see it again. Nicholson is just playing himself, the movie is at least a half hour too long and was actually dull in spots."
3,The Departed,"Bought it because of the ""big name"" actors in it and the awards it received...however, too much foul language in it to enjoy the acting. Just my opinion."
2,No Raging Bull,"Another typical hollywood shoot em up ending where everybody dies. Scorsese had a great movie going until the end, but instead of coming up with a realistic or thought provoking ending he sold out for the easy box office cash cow and killed everybody off. Obviously his academy award win was more of a life time achievement award than it was for this movie. If you want to see a really good gangter cop movie rent Donnie Brasco. But I must give you fair warning; the ending may be boring if you're male and between the ages of 15 and 25."
3,AN OK FILM BUT WAY TOO MUCH PROFANITY,"It seems to me that the script could have called for less profanity and still got the point across. Definitely NOT a film that the ""whole family"" can enjoy. Be that as it may, the movie itself was good, and very intense. I would just have liked to have seen less profanity used."
3,Want to see how the plot turns out?,"Buy Infernal Affairs the trilogy box set. The Departed is an adaptation of this Hong Kong film. Watch the original film, Infernal Affairs before Hollywood butches it!"
2,"Lengthy, filled with profanity","I love Jack Nicholson, which is the only reason I picked up this film.The Departed takes much too long to get started. The first 45 minutes could be clipped down to 20 to improve pacing. The profanity was stunning. I'm not a prude, but after the first 20 minutes I thought about just turning it off.That's a shame, because the final 20 minutes of the film are fantastic - a bloody conclusion worthy of crime film fans. The camera work is good, and so is the acting. There were some plot holes that could have been filled had they focused on that, rather than winning the Guinness Book's record for using the ""f"" bomb.Jack Nicholson's character had the BEST lines, though. I got a good laugh out of several of them."
1,Plot Holes Galore,The constant use of the foulest language was a real turnoff. I stayed with it to the end hoping it would have a satisfactory conclusion. It didn't. The film left me with so many questions I spent hours reading message boards hoping to find clarity. There are so many theories and contradictory explanations that I'm giving up. Some even suggest Martin Sheen's and/or Mark Wahlberg's characters were in league with the mobsters. I didn't get that impression at all. That people came away with different perceptions illustrates how poorly the plot was executed. I wish there was a director's cut with additional footage that would clearly define the characters and tie up all the loose ends.
1,STINKER,"A relative with an interest in organized crime wanted me to watch this.1). You know, even the real crooks and police do not talk that way. For example, they are able to put together three words without one of them being an obscenity.2). Big name actors who are also, in their private lives, individuals with whom I would want no contact and it shows in this picture.3). Contrived plot.To call this production a film noir or police procedural is truly an insult to the ones of that type made in the forties and fifties which are worth watching.Another reviewer stuck it out for twenty minutes. I lasted fifteen."
4,Most Violent Mob movie I ever saw....,"If you like seriously Violent gangster Movies this is your kind of Flick. I've got Goodfellas, The Replacement Killers, Casino in my collection but the heads shots, the blood and brains flying, the Cop being thrown off the roof and other kilings are definitely not for the kids. Good movie making, but you better have a strong stomach!"
4,The Departed in HD,"Can't really tell the difference between the HD and SD versions. The movie is full of stars and each one performs to their maximum ability. Good twist to the story line. I'm not a prude but would have been better if the ""F"" word had been significantly reduced in the dialog. Not real anxious to view a 2nd time."
5,Great Movie!!!,"I really enjoyed this movie, the acting was great and for a moment you forget they are actors and felt you are watching real lives. Di caprio and Nicholson performances were flawless, I don't like Matt Damon that much, because the only role that fits him is Bourne,he is so inexpressive that kinda get boring after a while.I would give the movie 5 starts but we watched in a group of 10 people, and only 4 of them were delighted, the rest was like 'Its OK'The HDDVD version is beautiful but there's ot much in the FX department to really tak advantage of the HD goodies.Its a worth buying Mafia film!!"
5,great film! you WILL enjoy it.,"ladies and gentlemen, this movie was directed excellently. there are many layers to the story and its definitely something that'll keep you guessing. i definitely recommend it."
5,Excellent Guide,"Steve Omera book ""Deep-Sky Companions"" is an excellent read and night time companion. I used to look at the night sky. Steve Omera's book has opened my brain to the sights. His descriptions use the same artistic language as a professional wine tester. In addition, his book uses quality paper and I have them while I observe. Dew does not seem to affect the paper, photographs or text in any fashion. All of Steve Omera's books are now on my short list for purchase."
5,Really liked this book.,"Book shows many styles of chip carving by different people that are all students of Wayne Barton. I would have liked more patterns, but the book is excellent for ideas."
3,A Voice That Often Goes Unheard,"As a psychotherapist, I found this book an invaluable source of practical wisdom. The author has articulated something that often goes unheard in a extraverted, ""more is more, and more is better"" culture. HSP's have difficulty making a relationship to their healthy creative selves; they have often learned to pathologize their gifts of intuition and introspection, depth and empathy. Separated from self, it should be no surprise that they also often become alienated from their partners, but when they are in sync with themselves, they can be warm, compassionate, spontaneous and profoundly present in love relationships. It is gratifying to find a resource that offers concrete suggestions and a wealth of support to HSP's. They are among the more gifted among us, and they need and deserve to be encouraged."
1,This book was lame!!,"If you're looking for actual pertinent, insightful and useful information you will be disappointed (especially if you are an introspective, educated person with any degree of insight into your own functioning and disposition)."
4,Affirming and Enlightening,"This book offered so much insight into my own interpretations of love, relationships (successful ones and not so successful ones) and the spiritual all from the highly sensitive person's unique perspective. It both affirmed and enlightened and gave me sense of joyous empowerment. I also felt recognized in this book. It was amazing how deep the author went to describe how and what a Highly Sensitive Person feels and interprets about all the various realms of love and relationship. Her compassion for the overwhelmed ""HSP"" in love was astounding. So often we are told that our sensitivity is a burden but Aron reminds us that it is our greatest gift to offer another. One of the most helpful and affirming books of my lifetime."
5,a timeless classic,i always get a kick out of this movie whenever i watch it. im more of a horror movie fan myself but my girlfriend made me watch the movie and i loved it. it really is a great movie that you WILL remember. with a colorful cast and a funny story-line that is such a great mix that you might never forget the movie even if you just rent it for a night and rip it off. if you only get one movie in your life make it this one
5,Still great after all these years...,"In all the teen comedies that came out, this has always been a very favorite of mine, and unlike so many 80's movies that get stale and are no longer funny, this one holds up very well.I have seen this movie countless times. It was nice to see a DVD version.The movie is funny, well written and directed by comedy god Carl Reiner. Plus unlike teen comedies today this one has heart and a good message, not just filled with D*&k; jokes.The cast is amaizing, Mark Harmon is perfect in the role of Shoop, and it was nice to reflect on an era when Kristie Alley was hot.I wish the DVD had more, but I understand that this movie never got the attention that a Say Anything, Breakfast Club or a Sixteen Candles ever received.I am just glad to have this in my collection on DVD.AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, tension breaker...had to be done.-Chainsaw-Mark"
2,Cute movie,"Well it was really odd to see Mark Harmon in this role. Thought it would be fun to show my son that Mark Harmon did something besides NCIS. He just kept saying, ""THAT'S Mark Harmon????"" ha ha ha ha The movie is kinda cute but oh my goodness....kinda hard to watch all the way through without getting bored. Nice to see Kirstie Alley in this too!"
4,Mark Harmon,"I LOVE Mark Harmon. I first discovered him in ""Reasonable Doubt"" with Marlee Matlin. I thought he was hilarious in this movie. His comedic timing was GREAT, especially in scenes with Robin Thomas. He did have chemistry with Kirstie Alley. I thought the last scene in the movie with his character's dog was/is a GREAT example of why women find Mark Harmon sexy.I like the fact the DVD came in good condition. It looked as if it were new. It came wrapped in protective plastic covering. This is what I always look for in any product I buy. I like for all products to look new or with very little wear. It also arrived earlier than expected. I look for the product to be the way it was advertised. The DVD exceeded my expectations."
4,The perfect 80's movie,"This is an excellent 80's comedy. Mark Harmon's zany humor and Kirstie Alley's more sarcastic humor compliment each other perfectly. When you combine the humor of these main characters with that of the school ""rejects,"" this movie is a load of fun. This movie's purpose isn't to really make you think or to tug at your emotions. It's purpose isn't that elevated. It's there to make you LAUGH......and it does just that! It not only makes you laugh, but it takes you back in time to that wonderful decade known as the 80's. I love Mark Harmon, and I love this movie. It can be enjoyed by both ""children"" of the 80's and 90's as well as older adults. I highly recommend it!"
2,very average,this film is two films in one.the classroom antics that make up Summer School and the CHemistry of Kirstie Alley&Mark Harmon.but the problem with this film is the typical cliches of School films in the 80's.
5,REALLY COOL !!!,"I've been lookind around for a copy of this film on DVD, i haven't found, unfortunally!!THIS IS THE BEST! People here in Brazil, LOVE this film. PEople around my age ( 18 - 30 ) grown up watching this film! It's very famous here, everybody knows this film! Summer School walks by Ferris Bueller side!"
2,previews I saw at the time were misleading,I was disappointed in this movie. I bought it because I like Mark Harmon and thought it would be 'decent' but it was littered with vulgarity and swearing. Previews were misleading and I feel it should be rated 'R'. Taught me not to buy a movie without renting first.
4,"Summer Fun, 80s Style","I hadn't seen this movie in years (decades?) and forgot just how stupid-funny it is.It is a welcome addition to my small collection of DVDs.If you're looking for a great storyline, Mark Harmon's best acting, and cinema at its best, stay away.This flick is not to be taken seriously and should be viewed ONLY by those who have that fun, warped sense of humor."
4,Simple but compelling,Gallico's tale of a little Italian orphan and his donkey is a simple little fable but told with such conviction that it touches the heart and mind.A wonderful little story with a message of faith for the reader.
2,I felt it wasn;t that great do to not enough details.,"I disliked the book because it wasn't all that interesting;it kept on dragging on about the boy trying to get help for the donkey. He would always be begging the priest to let him go to this town so he could get helpfor his donkey. The book could have had more charactors and talked about them a little more and they could have had more about the boy besides the fact that he was an orphan,they could have written where his parents were and how he became an orphane. They could of told us more about the boy and his past life."
5,My 2 year old can't get out of her seat any more,"I bought this because my 2 year old wouldn't stay in her car seat and we figured if she had an extra harness she would be stuck and hopefully safe. Well it worked beautifully, she can't even get an arm out anymore! If you have a baby that has great finger dexterity or is really interested in undoing things I might pass on this product because it is easy to open ( luckily my little one has no interest in undoing it, just working around it) but if you need to replace your harness on your infant seat or you think this would work to keep your little one in their seat then it's a great product"
1,Good replacement Clip. No good for added restraint.,We bought this clip as read somewhere it oferred extra restraint protection. We have a 3 year old mid-functioning autistic. Our little Houdinni debunked the clip in seconds and went free-ranging about our van. Wouldn't recommend unless you need a replacement clip for your existing seat and couldn't get one from it's original manufacturer.
4,"Just like it says, no problems","It fits the harness strap, easy to install, good quality plastic, and solves my problem. My toddler CAN'T unclip it herself. (The original one she'd just push the button and Houdini herself out of the bottom straps, then toddle up behind me and say ""Hi Mamma!"" as we're barreling down the freeway.Now she screams the whole ride because she can't get out, but hey, she won't die.... Oh yeah, good price, free shipping, happy with my purchase.I'd love if there was a black option, it would match the car seat."
4,Great replacement,For my particular madel of car seat it wasn't te right one but over all it's an original Graco product and it does the job it's just a little small for mine. I suggest to double check your model number and year of car seat
3,Focus is the Bloodguard not Covenant.,"A series of chapters, removed from the Illearth War book (it was already too large a volume and required editing) These chapters remove Covenant as the narrator, and focus on the Bloodguard, including rituals, origin and why THEY chose to protect the Lords. Their history and involvement is clarified with this text. I agree it has no place within the chronicles as the viewpoint is that of a third party, however, as a separate book it makes interesting reading when positioned as originally written in the middle of the Illearth War, although the tome was released as an afterthought following the end of the second chronicles. Is this an attempt by Donaldson to sell more books? Or is he genuinely concerned that the reader understands more about the Bloodguard? Read it and make your own decision."
1,wrong item received twice.,"I first received a new mom mug, sent that back for the correct item and then I received a sisters mug. At that point I said forget it."
4,Slight letdown,"While this is a good blues record, it hardly compares to Bell's previous effort, Kiss of Sweet Blues. That album sparkled thanks to Bell's sublime guitarwork. But that, unfortunately, is not the centerpiece it should be this time around. Instead what we have is solid blues, fine standards, and, overall, a weaker album. Another change, this time for the positive, is Bell's increased vocal prowess. But what I miss is that sweet guitar. A nice bonus is the addition of the final four tracks, all solo Lurrie Bell, practicing in the studio. They provide an interesting insight on Bell's raw talent, which, as he proved on his previous album and occasionally on this one, is tremendous."
2,Talk about Your Slow Moving Trains,"I actually didn't finish one of the three stories it was so boring! If you are in to injustices and blind ignorance, then maybe ""love [does] defy time and space,"" but this anthology was not for me.""Mountain Bride"" made me angry... there's no strong heroine here - she runs from her home when the townsfolk stub her over a stupid rumor, settles again, and plans to fly again once her ""family"" in the new town find out about the rumor. It's just plan dumb.I did not finish ""Apache Valentine""... enough said.""The Secret Heart"" is the best of the three, but obvious where it's going and how it will end.Not much to keep me awake wondering..."
1,I agree with Valentine Blunder,"I borrowed several books from my best friend and Affairs of the Heart was one of them. This was by far the worst anthology I've read. This was the first time I did not finish reading the complete stories. (All three of them) It was as if all three authors rushed to complete the story. Readers are becoming more and more picky. I know I am. I've enjoyed other books by Stobie Piel but I'm sorry to say, this did not meet the usual expectations. I've never heard of Laurel Collins. She is probably a new author and this was her first try."
1,No Value for this Valentine Anthology,"Sorry, I've read every anthology that I can get my hands on, but, unfortunately, this was my least favorite. Unlike some of the other readers, I will finish every book I start to give the stories half a chance and with each story I read, I was more and more disappointed. The plots were flimsy and s l o w moving."
2,Valentine Blunder,"Of the three, Collins spins the best story, however, that's not saying much. Predictable plot. No surprises, here. A shame because the character had such possibilities."
4,Hmmm... well...,"I bought this cause I have a Miraclesuit swimming suit and it works wonders.BUT I hate how this this has a SUPER pad on the breast and although u look slim and love-handles free, you end up with a pair of papayas in front of you....I found it a little soo short for tall women... Maybe I should try the plus size one... I don't know...Overall it is a great product. I am still studying what to do with it, maybe remove the bra and sew in another..."
2,shaper review,"I did not like this product. It was not long enough for my body length, so i was trying to pull up the top for the bra the whole time I was wearing it. The under wire for the bra went halfway down my rib cage. Eventually I just had to undo the bottom and let it slide up my torso so the bra would fit right. In the future I will chose a different style shaper that is made for a normal length torso."
1,terrible,The second i got this in the mail i tore open the package and tried it on. Took a while to pull it up to try to reach my breasts. The item could be a bit longer in the torso. it seams to pull my breasts down. Hugs the rest of my body nice for my current body shape but gives me granny boobies. I wanted to get this item simply because I wanted a strapless firmer. I am heavier in my upper body than in my lower and hard to find a firmer for the upper body that doesnt flatten the breasts (small breasts sadly). I am going to try to return this but like a dumby i took the tag off.
2,Where is the bonus materials?,No behind the scenes :( I was looking for something different. Want to see more bonus materials. . . .
5,Quite possibly the best season of The Amazing Race,"The Amazing Race 3, the season that started the series' Emmy domination, is quite possibly the best all-round season of the franchise. An excellent, diverse cast of teams, an interesting and exotic Race course, and some of the most memorable tasks ever on The Amazing Race; having the season finally on DVD is long overdue. Hilarious and fun moments, quotable quotes, beautiful locations, a flood of emotions, and the infamous ""Dieselgate,"" The Amazing Race 3 has it all. For fans that have been there from the beginning to fans that have just discovered TAR, this is a must have DVD set."
3,"Great show, poor quality discs","This is my favorite season of my favorite TV show, and I've been looking forward to getting it on DVD for a long time. Unfortunately, this DVD-R set suffers from poor quality control. Two of the three discs that I received have heavy circular scratches/scuffs that appear to have been caused during the production process. I returned the set for a replacement, but it has the same problem, and one of the discs is completely unreadable."
1,Major Quality Problems,"Episode #1 was good & #2 was pretty fun too until the DVD froze up. I pulled it out of the player & found it was terribly scratched, both across the disk from the center to the edge & major scoring around the disk tracks.Checking the other two unplayed disks, I discovered they were also deeply scratched/scored.Since I'd also purchased Amazing Race Season #4, I opened that one up and found all three of those disks were damaged right out of the box too.It appears the disk burner they're using is gobbling up the disks as it's producing them, and no one is noticing that they're sending out defective products. Hey, nice quality control!!!! A guy with a $100 DVR, making bootleg copies in his garage, would have a tough time making worse junk than what I received.Amazon is sending replacement copies, so I've got my fingers crossed that the 2nd time is the charm."
3,Meh!,"It was pretty good. We were set up for a control freak, and she just turned out to have mommy issues. Jake seems hot, but... Not my type. I'm from DFW and I just didn't connect well."
3,Cute,"This book was cute. Not the best I've ever read, but definitely not the worst. The characters were enjoyable, but nothing memorable either. A cute weekend read."
3,Weakest book of the triology,"I read the 'Sexy' books out of order, and this was one last for me. It's a good thing I didn't read this book first, because I wasn't that drawn in by the characters or thieir story. Basically, childhood friends Katherine Bloom and Jesse Chapman discover love when he returns home. Katherine was a fun and lively character, who provided humor and heart throughout the book, but Jesse... he was a cad, a player, a loverboy, etc. I really didn't see him as a fit with Katherine, and his reformed character just wasn't believable. The book was ok, but I'd skip it in favor of the other two in this series; the books stand individually and do not need to be read in order."
3,Just Okay,"This is another story where the heroine is in love with a man-ho.The good girl loves a man from her childhood who has too many notches on his bedpost and then finds out he has a child with another woman. Of course, none of this matters to her. If you like this type of story, then you'll like the book."
1,Terrible terrible terrible.,"I don't even know why anyone in the world would want to buy this movie. I don't even know why this is available on DVD. People say this is a ""fun, B-movie"", but trust me, I've never seen a B-movie as bad as this crap, and that's saying a whole lot."
3,Zombie Fun!!!,"I am a Diehard Zombie fan and pretty much own just about all zombie movies, even though this film is low budget the zombies looked decent and for some reason some scenes even reminded me of Lucio Fulci's Zombie which is as far as I am concered the best zombie movie ever made. So sit back grab a plate of Spagetti and Watch the meatballs fly in this low budget zombie flick!!!!"
1,zero stars,"This movie is awful! Here are just SOME of the reasons why:Styrofoam props.Cheap make-up effects.The most unattractive women you've ever seen. So bad you'll fast forward through the lesbian scene, TRUST ME!!Terrible cinematography.Virtually no plot.Gore is no more than puddles of mushed up sausage and raw chicken drumsticks.Sloppy/homely vampire women acting like men.Not to mention it's boring as all Hell.I cannot imagine what 2 and 3 have in store for me. I'm sure I'll have my DVD remote handy for the skip option. I'd rank the cheapness and stupidity up there with zombigeddon and splatter farm.Not even laughable, just DUMB!!"
3,repackaging of old classics,"Ok, especially if reader is not already familiar with the story. Old artwork form god knows when in the distant past.(maybe 1950's?) I was hoping for a new art version."
5,Brilliant!,"Precise, Great Advise. A true Bipolar Recovery book. I have never seen a self help book I couldn't put down. A great book for all those who suffer from Bipolar. Especially those who were victims of abuse. Speaks to those in commons language. Doesn't preach. Speaks of the importance of medication. A must own."
4,A humane look at bipolar disorder,"This is a very good memoir about the author's struggle with and recovery from bipolar disorder. It reminded me a little of ""Manic by Midnight"" in that an important message of the story is how to rebuild your life in the wake of the disorder, particularly in the wake of mania. The quality of writing is pretty good, as the author writes well enough to bring the story vividly to life. Not being too religious myself, I nonetheless didn't mind the juxtaposition of religion with the story, and if anything this contributed to the story. Overall, an interesting read. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
5,"Charming, brilliant, and sadly overlooked masterpiece","This is a post-apocalyptic tale for lovers of the poetic and surreal. The unnamed narrator lives in iDeath, a commune of sorts, still recovering from the time of the tigers. (In which the narrator was orphaned.)It's filled with lovely lyrical passages, snatches of humor, and a sadness that is guaranteed to, if not haunt you, at least stick with you for a while."
5,A real mind trip without the drugs,"I fell in love with the characters who live in Watermelon Sugar. The descriptions of their homes and lives is so 70's and off the wall. Forget normal thinking. Forget drugs. Doors opening into other dimentions, going to the mill, seeing the fish. It's been over 20 years since I read this book. I'm going to get it out and read it again. Then I'm going to encourage my kids to read it. Next comes Trout Fishing..."
4,"""In Watermelon Sugar"" a delightful story of life and death.","Richard uses a poem to tell us that just because or our customs may be different it doesnt mean that we are different. Watermelon Sugar is a place of simplicities where even the dead are cherrished. There is also levity in the way we realize how sometimes we really cant see the forest for the trees. If you are ready for a break from the conventional read, try this Book."
5,Short and Sweet...,"It's been 20 years since I've read this book, yet I still recall the opening line. Find the time to read ""In Watermelon Sugar"" - you won't be able to forget it."
4,Good live album,"Aside from Vaden's dying voice, this live album is really good. A nice mixture of songs from both studio albums. I never got a chance to see Toadies live, so I can't say how the live show is. Well not yet, they are reuniting on March 11th for a show in Dallas. I have seen Burden Brothers multiple times, and I know that Vaden's voice is much more powerful then what comes across on this album. All and all still a very good live album and a must have for Toadies fans."
5,New Toadies Lover,"This CD is great. ""Possum Kingdom"" is my all-time favorite song. The radio station I would hear it on never gave the song name or who sang it...until recently. I went right to my computer and bought ""Live From Paradise"". It is non-stop and energetic. Amazingly I only knew the one song but after hearing all 18 of them on this CD I also bought all of the Toadies other CD's. IF you like ""Possum Kingdom"" you will like this whole CD."
5,uncomplicated,"You've been to Italy,you've 'done 'Tuscany,now read the book.Isabella Dusi has crept into the heart of a mountain village/town,call it what you like, and made a place for herself in the bosom of Montalcino. I have travelled to Italy numerous times over the past twenty years and fallen in love with the people,the lifestyle the food and of course the wine so I can claim to have some little insight into this glorious country.However,Isabella Dusi has captured in her book everything that I have spent 20 years experiencing.Italians are a complex people,they live uncomplicated lifestyles for the most part and it is very difficult to get really close to a community such as Montalcino. What Isabella Has done is just that. To experience that alone is worth the purchase of this book."
2,"Decent, but slow paced","I bought this book prior to our honeymoon in Italy. I had high hopes for it, but unfortunately it was very slow paced. I was not able to finish it, so perhaps it picked up later on in the book. The author spent a lot of time describing things in too much detail, and it lacked a little of that something special that makes you wish you lived in Italy."
1,Vanilla Beans and Brodo,The delivery was very fast. The paperback was written on recycled paper and appeared dark. The print was small and that combined with the dark paper made it difficult to read.
4,"If you go to Montalcino, this is THE book to read.","I found this book enchanting and fascinating, although the author stereotypes the Montalcinesi and the Italians throughout the book.I read this book since I'm going to Montalcino in May.This book is full of interesting stories about Montalcino and its people. Much better than most guide books. If someone is going to visit Montalcino or any other hilltop towns of Tuscany, this is a must read."
2,A Poor Imitation,"Ms. Dusi may have been a talented businesswoman in Australia and she may have been in a dire need of an income while living her dream in Tuscany, but she is not a writer and I did not need another half-read bore on my bookshelf. A senseless rambling. In fact, the only intriguing thing about this book is its title and this is what lead me to click the 'buy' tab. This book cannot compare to the expat classics, such as A Year in Provence and/or Under the Tuscan Sun. Have no idea what all the gushing reviews are about."
5,Vanilla Beans and Brodo,"Having bought this book on a whim because it seemed to have something to do with Italy, I became utterly absorbed in it by the end of the first chapter.The book tells of a year in the life of an Italian hilltop village.By the end of the year the reader knows of many of the colourful characters who live in the town today, as well as the cultural traditions and festivals which are celebrated much as they were several centuries ago.The competitiveness between the four quarters of the town in the archery and the football competitions is riveting, but the most delightful part of the book for me was the descriptions of the food, and the pleasure with which the Montalcinese people prepare their food which really gave me the most pleasure.An unexpectedly wonderful read, and one which I would recommend to anyone who loves Italy, travelling, food, or all three."
1,Nice watch- while it lasted,"I owned this model for about six years. I found the watch easy to use, and functional. It was my first titanium watch, and I found the strap held up fine relative to scratches. The reason I give this watch one star, is that it leaked. I recently noted condensation under the glass. I sent it back to Citizen and they indicated the case tube leaked. Now out of warranty, I can change the CASE and MOVEMENT to repair. So- basically I need a whole new watch.So, while I enjoyed the watch I am disappointed that it failed in this manner.I have bought several Eco-Drives for friends and family as gifts, but will no longer buy Citizen products."
4,Citizen Titanium Blue Angels Skyhawk,"The question is whether this watch is a better choice than the Seiko, which costs less? It is lighter, because it is Titanium, but is that important? The Seiko is stainless steel, weighs more, and that means your arm will become stronger! Seiko has a better reputation as a higher quality watch, in my opinion and experience. The numbers on the bezel of the Citizen wear out, I have read! -- is that cool for a watch that costs as much as the Citizen? NOT! But, at least you will not have a battery that will wear out when you are on a flight and need the watch to function, so I guess it makes sense afterall -- emphasis on the word ""guess.""[...]."
2,It's a crap! Got burnt display!,"I'm really disappointed with this watch. Less than a year after buy it, got a display malfunction and shows a blank space instead the first carachter of the cities box. So, now I got "" EN"" instead ""DEN"" (Denver), "" HI"" instead ""CHI"" (Chicago), "" ON"" instead ""LON"" (London), and so on.Frustrating. Citizen should change its name to Itizen... Never more!"
4,Excellent watch BUT two annoying problems,"I have had this watch now for 6 years and its fantastic save two annoying problems.PROS:Works great and still looks as new as when I purchased it. No fading, no corrosion, no scratches on the crystal glass despite rough handling.CONS:* It does not support 30 min timezones. So for example, you cannot set India time(GMT + 5:30) in the world clock. Instead you have to choose Karachi time (GMT +5:00) or Dhaka time (GMT + 6:00). So when I travel to india, my watch is always 30 min slow or fast depending on what i choose* Daylight savings time needs to be set manually and for each time zone. So come summer or winter time, I have to manually switch it on or off in my watch. Secondly, If I switch on DST for US Pacific Time and I check the time in New York (US Eastern Time), the time will be incorrect unless I manually switch on DST for the US Eastern timezone too"
4,Love this watch,"I love this watch. Not sure how to use the slide rule, but sure it won't be hard to learn. No light and no glow in the dark hands suck.Tons of options make this watch great, but it is not easy to operate. You need to read the owns manual prior to operating anything. I have the titanium band. This band lessens the weight some, but it does pull hair. Wrist will be bald in a week."
5,Curt's Review,I fly international flight and love the time zones. Also since it is titanium it is lighter than comparible watches. Looks great too.
5,"Great product, great present!",Bought this watch as a present to my husband and he is absolutely in love with it! It looks beautiful and has all the cool features that gadget men would appreciate!
2,Not worth the money,"I bought the Cal King 4 inch 100% Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Pad because my mattress was firmer than what I wanted. I was dissapointed with the pad from the time I received it. The pad is long enough, but it is definitely not wide enough. It is about 4 inches short of the edge of my mattress. Also, I thought 4 inches was going to be thick, but within an hour of laying on the pad it is completely flat and does not offer any support. I've had the pad just over a month and I am considering throwing it away. The company put a ""restocking"" fee on the return of this product. They obviously did this so they are not as likely to have them returned. By the time you lose the shipping the first time, the restocking fee and shipping to return you have quite a bit of money into a product you don't have any longer. I am a very dissastified customer."
4,Good topper,Plenty comfortable. Was not quite 4 inches thick. More like 3 3/4. Was nice that it was full-length and completely covered the extra long twin mattress. Definitely slept better with this topper.
3,get the audio CD instead,"We had bought the audio CD & listened to it in the car over & over again. While it's very cheesy, it does provide good reinforcement of math facts & the kids enjoy it a lot (ages 5 & 10). I thought buying the DVD would be another good reinforcement- but it was a mistake to think so. The DVD is awful. Even MORE cheesy than just listening to the CD, and the kids who are supposed to be lip synching just look bored instead- I don't blame them! Get the CD instead & let your kids use their imaginations to create much more lively interactions than you will find on this DVD!"
2,My daughter wouldn't even watch it in its entirety once,"I wanted my daughter to like this and she was agreeable and excited to watch it. But, she did not like it, was unwilling to finish it, and hasn't gotten it out again. Since she is an auditory learning I was hopeful that this would be helpful to her but I was wrong.My daughter was 9 at the time I got this for her and was (and still is) struggling to learn multiplication.If the price isn't too high, you might want to give it a try. Based on reviews it does seem like some children like it. I think if your child likes it and watches it over and over, they can't help but learn."
4,great book deal,The book was a great price and in pretty good condition. Amazon is a great place to buy books. If you like to read and don't like paying full prices for books. This is an economical and dependable way to read.
2,I found this movie to be a bit confusing .,"I felt there should have been more action,understandible for younger children it was to serious like for an adult picture it did not live up to the hipe,I also felt that the child that drew the bug should get the funds for it.Children are going to be taking over as we age and we have enough angry teens in this world already they don't trust us adults and seem to be getting the bad end of the stick so to speak."
5,THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!,I WENT TO SEE THIS MOVIE FIVE TIMES IN THE THEATERS AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST EVER! DAVE FOLEY GIVES A STAND OUT VOICE FOR fLICK (OUR HERO IN THE MOVIE). THIS MOVIE IS GREAT FOR ANY AGE!
3,a movie for dreamers,"in this one,a would be inventor is sent on a suicide mission by the other bugs in an attempt to save the team.it is not expected to work obviously.to make matters worse,when he gets to the big city,he finds actors not actual warriors.the actors think hes a talent scout and he thinks they are warriors.they head home for the big confrontation with the bad guy bugs.the kids like it but theres better pixar films out there.its better than that cheap rip off antz.thats real good guys mispell ants on a childrens movie!dennis leary does the voice of a lady bug with some sort of gender identification issue.the real deal here is that dreamers make things happen.the movement of all history crawls along slowly until a dreamer comes along.someone who dares to achieve that which is said to be impossible.then and only then oppurtunities arise.convenience comes and ultimately books are written about the noble dreamer who dared to change the normal humdrum way things are going."
2,"Hmm, pleasing to the eye I suppose, but for the rest ...","Yes, it's pretty, but that's all I can say about this one. The storyline is rather dull, everything is very sweet (well, what do you expect from Disney, I suppose), and the soundtrack reminds me too much of the Toy Story one. The funniest thing in the film are the 'outtakes' at the end (definitely worth watching the credits for!)."
1,Get Monster Inc and Toy Story instead of this!,"... This movie is about bugs that don't to what they say. I rather would have watched Lilo & Stitch. ...As the movie opens, Flik (Dave Foley) and all the other ants are slaves of Hopper (Kevin Spacey) and his grasshoppers. So the ants want to be free from Hopper and his gang, and since Flike keeps messing them up, they sent him out to find stronger bugs. Flik does find bugs but not warriors instead the bugs he found are circus bugs. But he doesn't know that. Flik was sent out by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfuss). Phyliis Diller voices Atta's mother the Queen. The Movie should have been rated PG for the one swear word that I caught... This movie also came out in the same year as Antz. But if you want better movies from Pixar Toy Story, and Monsters Inc are the two for dvd or video..."
4,GREAT MOVIE I HAVE IT.,"Some obvouse democrats are saYING That this movie is politically incorect! It's all together icorreect its fiction its supposed to be DUh. Magda get real!!!!! ""The blades cut down t yap yap yap blah."" he can plant more. AND its just a television show. Ants cant make those. ants arent being taken over by grasshopper. But no the thing that gets YOU PEOPLE IS THE BLADES ARE CUTTING DOWN THE GRASS. ITS FRIGIN' FICTION!!~111! Dont anyone say that ya dont have lawn mowers!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im sure ya dont have little pluckers that pull it out of the ground. DER!!!!!!!! Oh and also the thing that gets ME is how does the dandeilion stay up and what stops the bird from gettin' 'em in the air. a BUG civilization. OH Why cant they team up and stop the bird w/ a rifal or something. they cant be that smart eh? ok im done"
1,Poor and bad film,"I have never seen in my short life a more artificial disney. It was very poor, boring and so on... I would better advise you to run into bed instead of wasting precious time watching this commercial product."
5,Childhood back again!,This is a must have for any Pixar fans. The film is breath taking from the cgi generated visuals and incredible voice acting. It brought back my childhood while watching this. And Kevin Spacey hands down stole the show as Hopper!
3,Bug's Life Special Edition,"I purchased this DVD with the expectation of quality info on the production and methodology behind Bug's Life. This was to some extent provided but only via rigorous navigation through CD2. The quality of the film leaves much to be desiged and is visibly of a poorer quality and clarity than the normal edition of Bug's Life. This is probs because they squeezed both widescreen and normal onto 1 side of a disc. If you're after more insight into the making of Bug's Life, this will give it, just.(6/10). If you want it for the film, get the other version!"
5,Quick service,Ordered as a last second Christmas present. Received it in plenty of time for wrapping. Thanks again for the quick work.
4,Very Good But lacks support for wide screen TVs,"Although this movie is one of the best I have seen in years, this version of the DVD does not have ""Enhanced Support for Widescreen TVs"" like most other DVDs have. There is a big difference between having a wide screen version, and the wide screen version supporting wide screen TVs. This is a serious omission for the serious video family."
4,Voice of Jonathan Harris a welcome treat,"It was great to hear Mr. Perfect Diction, Jonathan Harris, a.k.a. Dr. Zachary Smith, in the role of the preying mantis."
4,Something for everyone in the family.,"I thoroughly engoyed ""a bug's life"". I found that the movie can be appealing to all generations. An upbeat fatasy adventure for kids wile the character known as Francis has a cruel comiedic edge for teenagers. Most of the jokes can have parents laughing. Wile the movie is funny the viewer seams to have seen the story before (I can't seem to pinpoint an exact movie with the storieline). But there is no real problem with that because it works so well in the movie. I definatly recommend this movie."
5,"A hit with kids, and for the kid in you!","Having seen Toy Story, I looked forward to taking my son to this movie and was not disappointed. Disney keeps true to form, giving kids what they want and slipping in a message as well - you can do anything if you put your mind to it and with the support of friends anything is possible. Yes, the outakes were more geared to the adults, but my six year old was just as amused as I was. I have seen ""Antz"" and feel that this movie was geared more to adults than to kids. Disney has another winner with this one. I intend to buy a copy of this movie!"
5,"Sweet movie, yeh, yeh, yeh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I loved the show mate. It was not cheesy at all. I think everybody should see it. Just sit down and eat alot of popcorn, mate."
5,You will actually forget that it's computer animated.,"This is a movie that employs a medium to convey a story, it doesn't rely upon a medium to serve an agenda. Thank God, a story that my kids can watch without my having to sit around and explain why it's sick. It employs wierd, archaic devices like plot and character development and miserably fails to obsess on special effects. You will forget that this was done with a computer, and find yourself enjoying a movie with your kids instead. This must be stopped!!! Every once in a while someone manages to prove by excellent example that Hollywood is really as bankrupt in creativity as you don't want to believe. Buy this movie. Flush ANTZ, Woody Allen, Woopie Goldberg, Steven Spielberg, and Michael Eisner with them. The cultural hegemony enjoyed by Hollywood hasn't yet bought the last vestiges of sanity. Enjoy it while you can before they buy Pixar too."
3,ok to good,This dvd Kept our 3 yr old's attention. I liked it too. But there have been no requests to see see this again.
2,IT WASNT ALL THAT GOOD.,"I DIDNT LIKE IT VERY MUCH,I MEAN IT WAS CUTE AND ALL JUST NOT MY KIND OF MOVIE.ID MUCH RATHER WATCH A MYSTERY MOVIE LIKE SCOOBY DOO.BYE, JESSICA."
1,A Bugs Life,"When I my DVD FINALLY came in the mail, the DVD was not in its original case, it was in a store bought case with a picture cut out of paper and taped on, the DVD itself was cracked. I will never...NEVER buy from them again."
1,Way too scary for my kids,"I unwisely bought this DVD for my 4 year old daughter's birthday. Then I made the second mistake of letting her watch it without previewing it myself. I'll never do that again! She was terrified! We turned the movie off and have never finished watching it. It might be a good movie for older kids, but mine won't be watching it for at least a few more years."
1,Big mistake to buy this film,"I was earning over $20.00 dollars in cash to buy something nice for my brother, who by the way is 4 years old.My first mistake was to buy it at all.My second mistake was to letting my brother watching it without watching with him first.It is way to scary for kids under 10 years old, and also little kids might learn words like if you don't do this or if you don't do that ""I'll Kill You""Really, people, save your money for something useful.Not this worthless piece of junk that Disney calls ""a movie"" and that Disney rates it ""G""It should really be rated ""PG-13"""
2,Not for toddlers,"I'm a first time mom and bought this for my toddler. Beware and prescreen all movies. This is way too scary for kids under 7-8+. It was even creepy to me. I guess older kids may like it.******************************************************************************************************************************ok, let me clarify. 7-8+ was probably too high of an age to start watching this movie. My son was 1-2 years old when we first started watching it and he was scared. He's a little bit better with it now but is still afraid. We recently tried to watch Antz too and he was scared of it. This is why the title of my review was ""not for toddlers"" I think by the age of 4, he could really enjoy this movie without being afraid and telling me to turn it off."
2,Small as a bug itself......,"Crap. Boring. Stupid. A Bug's Life deserve's no praise. Apart from it's excllent cast (Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus) the whole film is pointless and silly.There is this bug called Flik who goes out looking for more bugs to help him save the colony from giant grasshoppers. And what has he got around him?A Bug's Life is no good, trust me. It isn't ""marvellous"" , ""wonderful"" or ""lovely"" - it is just STUPID!Antz isn't any better either."
2,rent option?,It says this film is available to rent but when I click on it the only option is to buy. A lot of these movies are doing the same thing. any idea why? Help will be most appreciated.
4,Another Disney/Pixar classic!,"If you liked Finding Nemo, you can't go wrong with A Bug's Life. Kevin Spacey is (not surprisingly) brilliant as the villain Hopper, but there's also some great voice work by folks who are no longer with us (Jonathan Harris, Madeline Kahn, Joe Ranft), adding a note of poignancy to the story. A wonderful DVD to own, whether or not you have kids."
5,great offer,i will make another purchase the movie was like newi got my moneys worth really happy with the product
3,OK Movie,"My daughter liked it a lot, but I found it average. It did not have the benefit of being one of those movies that kids like, but adults can also enjoy."
4,Like this movie,Not one of our all time favorites but we do watch it on occasion. Nice to have all the outtakes that crack us up! He he he.
5,Warm and Fuzzy,"This film is warm and fuzzy without being gross. The cuteness was kept in check by the voice casting. (Denis Leary is an adorable ladybug!) See this movie. It's gentle and warm, a nice change."
5,Animation brings long-awaited splendor to the screen!!,This was the best movie that I have EVER seen. It had something for everyone. The animation never fails to place one in awe. I cannot wait for this momentous movie to come out on video!!
4,What a DVD should be,"Okay, so i preffered AntZ, and i keep expecting to hear Woody Allen every time the hero speaks. But this is a lovable film. I don't think it is that suitable for very young children as a friend of mines kids will attest. The DVD is full of stuff and the quality is perfection. Hope they keep up high standard they have set when it come to reslease there other works."
5,Love Your Bugs,"I find the movie ""A Bug's Life"" very amusing. Its computer graphics are amazing and its characters are charming. It presents the ant's colony in a different, enjoyable point of view. It's thrilling and will keep all the family entertained. In its clever way, the movie visualizes a world that can not be seen with special effects. Though the main idee is the same, ""A Bug's Life"" is even funnier then Antz."
5,Pixar Pixar Pixar!!!,"As a 3d modeler myself, I can only dream to create that which Pixar has done. The characters move so seamlessly, so realistically (for ants!). I was absolutely amazed. The story is also a work of art. The humor is constant and yet, subtly dramatic. It was a fantastic film not simply for the young ones either. I am 23 and I loved it!!!"
5,Funny HA-HA!!,"Even for a grown person, I laughed at so many scenes in the movie. It was just too funny. I had to watch it over and over. A must have film even if you don't have kids."
5,This movie is so cute.,I loved it when I saw it at the movie theater. I knew that when it came out on video I would buy it instantly. The characters are funny and the voices go great with each character. The graphics are great. One of the best kids movies of all time.
3,i think it's fun!!!!,"I haven't seen it yet. I wanted to but the video thru Amazon Shopping but, i'm afraid that i'm not able to watch it in Holland co'z it'says (NTSC and can only be use in the USA and Canada) Is this true? pls.reply to this letter co'z i don't know where or whom to inform. Greeting from Holland, Ruthie:-)"
3,"The movie was corny, sappy at times but it was a good movie.",I think kids and adults alike would enjoy this movie. It's not great but it's fun to watch with anyone in your family.
3,effects are very good but the story is a little bit simple,"It's about the bugs life. The story is more of an ant story on how they live. And at the end, the story reveals that there is nothing impossible to achieve when they are as one. As the saying goes united we stand divided we fall."
3,Excelent DVD But the description of the product is not very explicit,"The DVD and the movie are both excelent! the quality of the pictures and sounds are great. The box is so beatiful and I didn't found any damage in the package.I was disapointed because I thought the movie came with Spanish trak and it only comes with english and french. The description and especifications of the product just mention the english, never talked about the whole audio languages it has...--------------------------------------La pelicula y el DVD como tal son excelentes, la calidad de los dibujos y sonidos es muy buena y no encontre ningun dano en el DVD.Pero me desepcione porque pense que el producto traia espanol como audio alterno y solo traia el ingles y frances. Pero ni la descripcion del producto ni las especificaciones nombraban a ninguno de los otros idiomas, solo hablaban del ingles...Buen producto, mala descripcion del producto en la pagina"
4,Hayden's Bugs Life Review,I thought it was better than Ants. Flick was a great character. Suitable for kids of all ages. I would recommend this movie highly
3,Awesome Movie - Terrible Extras,"I bought this DVD because I love Pixar's animated films. After seeing both Toy Storys and Finding Nemo I have become a huge fan of their work. A selling point for me was the second DVD supposedly filled with great extras. I was disappointed to find that when I watched this second DVD I saw the Pixar crew doing these dumb little paradoies which they must have thought were funny, but which I found to be a total waste of DVD space.I wanted to see how they made the film, in-depth views on the making of the characters, the story, and how the people behind the film developed their ideas. Instead I got The Three Stooges telling terrible jokes along with a muppet flea.After seeing this ""special edition"" I would recommend you save your money and just buy the movie itself, which is far superior to the antics of its creators."
3,"If I Was A Bug, I'd Like This Sort Of Life","A little less sophisticated than its 1998 contemporary, Antz, Pixar's A Bug's Life still has charm as it takes us along on one ant's (Flik, voiced by Kids in the Hall Alum Dave Foley) personal quest to fend off strong-arm grasshopper extortionists (think Seven Samurai here) by hiring a private army of circus performers to hold the menacing horde at bay. Got that? There's little violence but the de rigueur implied death of a villain at the end is redeemingly satisfying. Adding to the film's charm are the voice talents of some '90's A-listers, including Kevin Spacey (jeez, has he vanished or what?), David Hyde Pierce, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Denis Leary, as well as stars of more classic cinematic eras, such as Rodney McDowell, Phyllis Diller, and Madeline Khan. If you've grown up some since seeing this movie---and who among us can maintain otherwise---see it again from a new perspective. It works for young and post-young alike."
3,An Okay Film,"But you would be much better off some of Pixars other animation masterpieces, such as Toy Story, Monsters Inc, and the new and my favriote of the bunch; Finding Nemo. A bugs life's plot is not interesting at all, and the only reason it was worth some of my money was Pixars great animation."
3,Complete set,"It includes two of the three versions I like in a set BLU, and a Digital Copy, but is lacking a DVD version."
2,Too scary for my 3 year old,I bought this for my 3-year-old because it was rated G but when we sat down and watched it she asked to turn it off because she was afraid of the big angry grasshoppers.
3,Not as good as it could have been.,"My Grandma taped this movie for our family a while ago, and I was excited to see it because I had heard so much about it. Needless to say, I was a little disappointed but not much. And I'll tell you why.The animation is great, but Finding Nemo is so much better. The story line is good, but not as good as it could have been, I thought. The dialogue is wonderful in some parts, but in other parts its not so great, especially when a bit of dirty humor came into play (for pity's sake, this is a kids movie!) . However, if you can get past these flaws, you will find a movie that is funny, interesting, and will keep your kids mesmerized for the entire film."
1,Horrible,I do not recommend this movie for 5-6 year old kids. I have a younger sister that is 6 and she thought it was scary. I did not it was funny one bit.
5,"It's great,something to see again and again","lately I haven't been very happy with recent Disney movies, but this movie was outstanding!Even though I loved the whole movie, I have to say my favorite part was the bloopers.If you haven't seen it, you need to."
3,let down,"I loved that I found a bugs life on blu ray, but once it arrived there was a huge chuck of flicks face riper off of the paper cover"
4,A Familiar Story from an Unusual Perspective,"A fairly run-of-the-mill story, peppered with enough unusual perspective and little bits of pure Pixar genius to somehow become something much more. Although the animation hasn't aged particularly well, an ambitious scale and a knack for breathtaking compositions provides ample compensation. Great voice acting from an all-star cast, a few good jokes for every age range and a plot that's simple enough to draw anybody in, but deep enough to snag them for the duration. It doesn't hold up against Monsters, Inc. or The Incredibles, but it certainly makes for good company."
5,That D. Afton guy (below) is crazy. It's an awesome movie!!!!!,"I LOVED IT! I'd give it 10 stars if I could! My kids mimic the friendly, cute diaglogue, not the bad dialogue like that D. Afton's kids."
4,Cute Movie. Great for young children,"Overall the DVD was good and very much appropriate for young children. However, after a couple of weeks it had fallen to the back of his preference list. We've not watched it in over a year now. I guess this isn't so different from any other DVD we have.I would recommend this for young children. It does have a few concepts that are not appropriate, but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent. The movie is mostly an original concept but there are striking similarities to Antz."
5,Classic tale made available to children,"Since well before I was blessed with children or the release of ""A Bug's Life"" I have been a great fan of this story. The Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven tale has always been classic around the world and I was very pleased when it was finally made available to a younger audience. My three year old son enjoys this tale immensely and is already grasping some of the basic morals presented."
2,Too nice...,"Only a short comment from me. The film was too colorful and too ""nice"". I was almost feeling sick by all the brightness and coloring. I must say that Antz was 100 times better. Both in the estetics and the plot."
4,Alnas review,Its a pretty classy film with lots of humour and crazy ideas. Most bits are classy but some are not quite to my understanding. This film is a spiffing film but bits I inply that they are not to my knowledge. 8/10
3,Cute movie,It is not as good as the other Pixar movies and do not keep my son's attention like Toy Story and cars.
3,a real kids' film,"unlike some of the other animated films put out by pixar, this one really is for kids. it's a bit too cute and there's not much humor for adults. compare 'bug's life' with 'antz' - another film about bugs - which is really an adult film thanks to humor courtesy of woody allen. watch it (bug's life) with your kids, but don't bother if you're looking for something for yourself. try 'antz' instead."
2,I am very dissapointment,"In the information appear Dolby Digital in Spanish and French, but only Traks is in English. My languaje is in Spanish.The movie is wonderfull and the audio too. My only dissapointment is the Traks."
2,ANTZ is better,"thius movie's story is unoriginal and boring. Other than some funny gags and some great animation, there is nothing for me to recommend this movie. TOY STORY 1 & 2 are much better and I recommend getting the DVD box with those movies."
1,WAY too scary and inappropriate for young children,"I just rented this movie for my 3 1/2 year old. He seemed fine during the movie, and even though I was uncomfortable with the language and the bad behavior of the characters I let him watch it. BIG mistake in parenting on my part. The grasshoppers were really scary to him and the abrasive language affected him as well. He fell asleep crying, and only an hour after I tucked him into bed and he already has woken up with a nightmare. We know a lot of kids his age and a little older who walk around calling people ""stupid"" and saying things like ""I will kill you"", and we always talk with our son about how that behavior is not ok. To have a disney/pixar movie reinforcing that type of behavior is sickening. And we wonder why kids these days are becoming less and less respectful, we are training them to be so. I will never let my kids watch another one of these so called family movies unless I have screened it first. SOOO DISAPPOINTED IN DISNEY/PIXAR!!!!!!"
4,It is like ANTZ,My sister just told me about the movie. It is great! Even if I haven't heard the whole story! So I rate this video 4 stars
4,one of the best disney film for childrens and why not adults,"was great, especial if you got children, great sound effect, if you got 5.1 surround,after toy story i rated this one top 5"
5,A pixar classic,"Though Bugs Life wasn't quite as popular as its predeccesor and succesors, i think that bugs life is still one of the best films that pixar has created. the picture and audio quality are, as always, stellar! This is a must have for all who enjoy pixar, and just a good film for the whole family"
4,It's anything a kid could want,This movie is great. The best part is the bloppers. The best is when hemlich pulls the grass but it doesn't come out of the ground. Did you know I'm GAY
5,Best Disney Film EVER!!,"This Disney film has a positive message. In most Disney films, that I have seen, there is always a dark side. This film is always upbeat and fun to watch!! A Bug's Life spends more time having fun than bugging you down!"
4,Good movie,This is a great movie that is suitable for all the people in the family. If you are 1 or 1000 this movie would be great for you.
5,Excellent Movie!!!,"Very well done! Excellent story, voices, and graphics. I applaud Pixar for their quality production. The Chess Match short is very funny as an added bonus to A Bug's Life. It was funny to hear Jonathan Harris, Dr. Smith of Lost in Space fame!"
4,Stays Funny After Dozens of Viewings,"There aren't many children's videos I can sit through dozens of times (and many I can't stomach even once). But this one is a spectacular exception. The story is good (Seven Samurai, The Magnificent Seven, The Three Amigos). The scripting is clever and funny. The voices are good and the animation is really top-notch. My 3-year old son loves it (he has practically memorized it) and I have no problem joining him and enjoying every minute. The DVD also includes a short animation which alone is almost worth the price."
3,Cute movie but expected better from Disney and Pixar,"A Bug's Life was a cute movie but I expected more from the collaboration efforts of Disney and Pixar. It lacked the musical majesty of previous Disney movies such as The Little Mermaid and Beauty and The Beast. My children, ages 3 and 4 enjoyed it but it was to simplistic for the adult viewer."
3,Ripoff of the three amigos,"This movie rips off the three amigo's. In the three amigo's Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short perform on screen as heroes. A small village hires them to help them fight el Guapo, a man who has terrorized their village for years.The movie does have it's good points though and if you have a kid, he'll probably enjoy this film"
3,"Fantastic Animation, But Okay Plot","""A Bug's Life"" was not a disappointment. The graphics and animation were great no doubt. The plot sort of reminded me of the plot of ""Three Amigos,"" in that the circus insects come to the anthill thinking that they're just there to act and entertain. The plot could have been better I think. But other than that this is not a bad movie. The outtakes in the end credits are pretty funny."
3,"Stunning picture quality, stunning animation, mediocre movie","The animation is incredible. The quality of the DVD transfer is incredible. No problems there. However, beneath the gloss it just isn't that good a movie. The story is weak and often makes little sense, the characters are 'flat', the music is unmemorable, and it just isn't that funny. Also, the Disney saccharine combined with the violence of the storyline leaves a disagreeable taste, in my view. In short, ""Antz"" is a much better and funnier movie. Watch this one just to appreciate the animation."
4,Home Gardening on a micro scale,The product is perfect for starting seedlings in a small area. I put it together from start to finish in ten minutes. Where I live there isn't much of a growing season and the light provides a jump start on the season. Indoor herbs can be grown year around using this light.
4,Assembly was a problem,"The unit is sleek and operates as described. However, a connector piece broke during assembly and the fix involved a piece of dowling and super glue. It was simple to fix. Be careful when you are putting this together."
5,Works great,This product is great to use along with Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat or just for 2-3 small to medium house plants that need extra grow light.
5,Yes!,"I was a little nervous about ordering this because of quality issues on some of the reviews. They must have fixed the issues because this was the easiest thing I have ever put together. It's sturdy, attractive enough actually (I just did not want to drill holes in the ceiling and have those sort of um, ugly lights hang down from the ceiling, even in the garage. So, very happy with the set up and appearance. Now let's see if I can grow some stuff. Excellent. Good job.p.s. I bought this along with the hydrofarm germination station that someone had suggested in a review. Thanks for that. It is a perfect fit."
4,Works Great,"I was a little afraid to order this because of previous reviews, but found this item to be perfect for what I wanted to use it for. Set up is easy, fast and works just great. Maybe not the most high quality product for the price, but other ones out there are much more expensive and are basically the same. This is just a simple way to get light to your seedlings for a couple months before planting outside. The light raises and lowers just as advertised. Works Great. Would buy it again."
4,10 months later and I'm writing a review.,"First off the bulbs are not a standard length and cannot be purchased at a home improvement store and must be bought from Hydrofarm. I have my plants near a window so I haven't used this all summer because the sunlight is more than enough to keep my plants alive. But as winter set in again and the days grow shorter, my plants became droopy. I put the light back up and the plants are up and well again. Also works great as a lamp, if you want to really brighten up your space. Also, its T5 so its really energy efficient!"
5,Easy setup,Easy out of the box setup. i have mine on a timer now for the past week and it seems to be working just fine so far.
4,Start Seeds Inside with Grow Light System,"This was a little difficult to put together for me with my disabilities. But I did it! I wish it had two lights. I tried to start seeds with it, but they do better in my Aero Garden . I'm hopingIt will be enough to keep my pepper and tomato plants going until spring. The replacement bulbs are not all the same, so be careful that you get at least what you got with it. I'm still trying to find some that are affordable and will do the job."
1,Poor product,"I ordered this lighting fixture from Amazon having been misled by the large number of satisfied customers . The package arrived promptly and the parts look well-made and sturdy. However, I failed at my first attempt to assemble the stand. The vertical bars do not fit into the base stand even after pounding with a soft mallet as suggested in the manual. In addition, the provided screws for holding the parts together are way too short. After nearly half an hour of trying, I had to give up and return the product. Then I went back to the Amazon website again and found several very negative reviews about this product as having "" poor design"" , "" impossible to attach the light"", ""poor quality light"" and so on. This has taught me a lesson: one should never only look at the positive reviews."
1,light bulb won't work,"I read ALL reviews and decided to buy it anyways, to add extra light to my orchids. The instructions are SUPER easy to follow.The structure is strong enough to perform its job: hold the light fixture. It's sturdy, slim, even cute. I loved it!The only problem is that the light bulb wasn't working. There was something loose inside of the light bulb that came with the fixture. I went to Home Depot and local hardware stores but none of them had the same T5 bulb size. I did notice that none of their light bulbs were making the same loose sound my was making.Amazon replaced my item but the problem persisted. Even though I loved the item, I had to return it. Have I received a 3rd light fixture, it would probably have the same light bulb problem.I gave it 1 start because if the light bulb doesn't work, then the whole system serves no purpose."
1,DOA,The item's quality is not so great. It's not very stable and it was not built to last. The worst part is that mine was DOA.
2,"Good, solid product - rotten packaging!","The product is fine -- it did not take more than half an hour to set it up and get the plants under the light.However, the package was left outside my door, in the pouring rain. It had no external wrapping, just the very colorful box that held everything without any packing whatsoever. So the box literally melted on my doorstep.Although the product inside was OK, this was a very shabby way to mail it to me. It is only pure luck that everything inside was not shattered."
5,Just plain excellent,Great value for the money. My plants are doing so well after using the light for a few weeks. Full spectrum light provides strong solar-type growing power.
3,not as good as I thought it would be...,"This grow light and rig is good for seed starting. Not great. My 72 count seed starting kit is too wide so I've had to move the seed start tray daily to make sure each plant gets enough light. Even moving the tray around has not kept some tyes from becoming leggy. For seed starting with an average size tray, get a broader lightsource. For plants that will be kept directly under the light- almost touching the lamp- this set up will be fine. I wish I had spent the money for a better table-top grow light rig."
4,PLANTS LIKE IT,GREAT FOR GIVING ALL YOUR PLANTS A SHOT WHEN THEY NEED IT. BEGONIAS LOVE IT. ONLY ABOUT 18 INCHES CLEARANCE
4,Nice first grow light,"Works great for my aquaponics grow beds, and I like that the light's height is so quick to adjust as the plants start growing. The cord sometimes comes loose from the light, but that's my only quibble. Very easy to assemble."
3,Not enough light to start seeds,"I purchased this to start one flat of seedlings. It came quickly, assembled easily, and fits a standard flat perfectly. The pully system makes it easy to keep the light right above the new plants. Unfortunately, the light is only strong enough for the center rows of seedlings - the ones in the outer rows bent towards the light and got leggy. Coverage is exceptionally bad when the light is close to the flat. Prior reviewers had mentioned the weak light but I thought the newest version of the product had corrected the problem with a larger reflector and brighter bulb. Not so. My plants have not done well at all. The stand is nice and the light might be adequate for other purposes, but I don't recommend it for starting more than a few seeds."
4,Might have found the answer,"I was hesitant to buy this after reading some of the negative reviews about not being able to put it together, but took the leap anyway. Sure enough, I couldn't clip the light to the fixture.... because they had provided TWO sets of clips for mounting under the counter and NO sets of clips for mounting it to the fixture (instead of one of each as the enclosed instructions indicated). However, a quick e-mail to their web site with an explanation of the problem resulted in the proper clips arriving within two days. Whole thing works like a champ now. I'd give it five stars if it weren't for the added hassle."
5,Jump Start Grow system,Unit ships with a single t5 lamp that will start seeds to a couple of leaves but is not enough light to take palants to bloom.Unit is strong well made. With the addition of a four bulb t5 light assembly it is just wonderful.
2,"Works ok, but ...","I'm generally happy with it, but I'm using it for a single flat of seedlings, and the seedlings on the edge of the flat are bowing inwards toward the light and not growing nearly as fast as those in the center. I'd recommend a four-light system to provide better coverage of the entire flat."
2,Can't find working bulbs for this,"The unit is pretty flimsy and came with a burned out bulb. Can anyone tell me where to find replacement bulbs for this? Everywhere I look online all I can find is 24"" bulbs and the one that fits this unit is 22"" and about half as wide as the standard 24"" ones. I'd really like to get my lights going! Thanks."
2,no better than my window,"First of all, if you're checking out this 2-foot system, make sure you think about investing in a 4-foot one for just a few dollars more. Wish I had noticed before I bought. However, I'd probably be returning that one anyway, because the light is just too wimpy for even a standard-size flat of seedlings. The seedlings in the very center rows of my flat look okay but all the ones on both sides, i.e. half of my seedlings, are stretching in toward the center to the weak ONE BULB florescent light. So I wasn't very happy with it in any case for both of those reasons, and then the light inexplicably stopped turning on and would flicker off by itself. I could tap on the end where the bulb went into the light unit and it would turn on again, but then awhile later I'd notice it just turned itself off or shorted out or whatever it was doing. I definitely won't be getting a replacement, I'd rather invest in something stronger and larger."
5,Just the right light!,"This light is just right - the right size, the right height and the right width, allowing all my small plants that won't fit on the windowsill to flourish. It works great for my terrariums, too."
3,Grow light,This grow light is a good buy for the money Invested and works very well. I would recommend it for an inexpensiveway to start seedlings indoors for home and school settings.
4,"Just put it together, went just fine, very easy, no more s hooks also","some peope were complaining this thing didn't fit together very well, it looks like they fixed the problems all i had to do was five minutes worth of work and its all set up, does not has S hooks like the picture it has an inexpensive yet functional rope pulley system. Also someone was complaining it wasnt shipped well, well they more than fixed that.. I got mine in an amazon box in another amazon box then I got to the box with what i ordered and within are a separate box for the light and box for the stand so I got it with five boxes... Im giving the item four stars till I see if it puts out the results im looking for, until then it seems to be good quality and its pretty darn bright..."
4,Get a start on growing seedlings,"The system includes the light frame, the light bulb and hanging light fixture. You are responsible for setting up the plant trays which are not included. Get the light frame first then decide what kind of planting materials you want to work with. It has worked well and most of the seeds planted 3 weeks ago are up and growing. Might work better in a warmer room to keep a more constant temperature for the seeds to sprout. Inexpensive way to see if you really want to start seeds yourself or go buy plants at your local nursery."
3,Good system; light difficult to replace,"This is a nice compact system that works well. However, when the light burned out, within a couple of weeks, I found that it is difficult and expensive to find replacement bulbs since it is not a standard size."
5,Easy to Assemble and Pleasant to Use,The Burpee Hydrofarm Grow Light System is a true 5 star gem. It works like advertised and is easily assembled in less than 10 minutes. Mine is starting plants for the summer which I've never fast started. Anyone having trouble with this item should let their 8 year old neighbor put it together and demonstrate its use.
4,"Product photo misleading, but good for seedlings and windows.","You will not get thriving blooming plants from this fairly modest, low-cost, grow light system. If you place it in a window which gets a southern exposure, you might achieve the results shown in the photo.The system works well for seedlings when you lower the light, per the directions, to close proximity with the soil. The system is easy to put together, pretty steady and well built.Overall, I highly recommend it as a grow light system in a box. You do not need to go find components, as they are all there. All that is missing is the grow box, potting mix and the seeds."
5,Jump Start for Bonsai,I purchased this because I am just starting with Bonsai and I received a deciduous Bonsai tree for Christmas. I need the extra light because of my window arrangement. I read the writeup online and decided this had the right kind of bulb to boost my trees.This device is wonderful. It is very high quality. All the parts are heavy duty and they fit together perfectly. It is very easy to assemble and it works great. The cord and switch is heavy duty. The height of the light is adjustable and even the paint looks great! It was very well packed. I highly recommend this grow light. I have seen it in a local store for a great deal more.I was having trouble with one of my trees and this light was instrumental in helping me recover it this winter. I only use it in the day time to give my trees a boost.So now I bought some starter trees online and I'm going to order another one of these lights today.
3,Starting seeds under lights,"this kit does what it says it will, but I had to buy a heat mat to go under it, and wish that I had looked for one that had two, side-by-side lights for a wider grow area. But it works well in terms of height adjustment and ease of set up. With the heat mat I have had great success. Even tho I was late getting started, my sets will be ready for outside planting at the right time."
3,"Bad bulb, easy instructions","I was very excited to get my first plant light setup but my shipment was somewhat disappointing. It arrived on time and was easy to put together and appeared to be all in one piece and functional, until I checked the bulb. It seems to have broken internally as it makes a jingling noise when lightly shaken and does not light up with the switch flipped either direction. So now I've had to order a replacement bulb and with luck that will fix my problem."
1,no help instructions,"Bought it last winter, or spring, and just now went to put it together. The ""instructions"" don't have pictures or step by step instructions. A necessary part is""(not included), and there is not even a picture on the box of how it is supposed to look once put together. The instructions are so vague that I am convinced that whoever wrote them is not a person for whom english is a first language."
1,couldn't contact company to return,"the product was fine, except for the horrible assembly instructions. When I realized I needed a different product and wanted to exchange it, this ""warehousestore"" was no where to be found. I followed the proper channels through amazon, but no one contacted me, and I couldn't find a company website. So, if you plan on never having to return or exchange something, warehousestore is for you, cause i was stuck with my purchase."
2,Agree with previous postings....,Poor quality and hard to put together. Spend more money on a different product. Light should be better packaged to avoid damage (although mine was fine).
1,"A $5 light, for $50","Bulb is small and, while I will give it a try, in my estimation that's a $5 fixture which is being sold for $50. The adjustable"" string slips much too easily and does not hold the light up correctly. The wire is too thick and interferes with setting of the light height."
5,Great Book!,My daughter loves this book series! We cannot wait for the next one to come out. Great Transaction!
2,No joy.,For some reason the story just falls flat. The characters should be engaging but they're not. My 4-year-old granddaughter had me read it twice but both times lost interest half-way through. I bought it because she has a thing for possums but apparently not this one. Disappointing.
1,Humor value but not useful for serious arguments,"The transparent ideological bias of the author and the intellectual laziness displayed by using straw men and streching the truth in places greatly limits the effectiveness of the author's agenda. I believe there is a real argument to be made that ideology (on both sides) plays too great a role in the intellectual discourse among academics, who should know better. This is not the best place to find such an argument, however. The book's appeal will be limited to those few inclined to ""fall for stupid ideas"" themselves. The irony in the authors' lack of self-reflection does offer the reader some humor value, perhaps. But the thoughtful conservative reader looking for reasoned arguments to make among serious people might want to look elsewhere. (Sadly, however, Gresham's Law seems to apply to current political writing)."
2,Please revise that title!,"When I saw the title of this book, I thought, finally a non-partisan book that exposes the lunacy of the thinking both sides of the political spectrum. I myself know of extremely intellegent people who let ideology twist their thinking and make them utter stupid comments. I thought, this was THE book that I had been dying to get my hands on - until I read the excerpts and found out how extremely partisan Flynn really is.He honestly believes that only left-wingers are engaged in the shallow-thinking trap while ignoring the fact that right-wingers can be accused of the same thing. Letting ideology dictate your beliefs without engaging in critical thinking is bad no matter what side you're on. Flynn is an extreme hypocrit and should offer equal criticisim to his own party as well as those of liberal ideology.Flynn should be more frank and just title the book ""How Left-Wing Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas""."
3,I'm buyin' this one,"Haven't read it yet - just reviews. I will pick it up and review it as soon as possible, because it sounds fascinating. I just couldn't resist responding to the first review (rant). Millie tries to portray Ted Kascinski as some kind of right winger. Come now, Millie. The man was a radical environmentalist. He had Al Gore's book, Earth in the Balance prominently displayed and marked up with favorable notes and scrawls. This man was a radical leftist and communist. For you to try to portray him otherwise is simply laughable. And if Tim McVeigh was an intellectual, then I'm the King of France."
3,Millie's Obsession with Screed,"I have not read the book either, but given MillitheCat's stellar review, I will be giving it in quantity for Christmas presents. I note that Millie's review was (as of this writing) found to be helpful by exactly 7 out of 90 people. Her/its reviews of Flynn's other books have been found helpful by . . . no one."
1,Too much deception,"This is probably the most biased book I ever purchased. Shortly into the chapter on environmentalism, I began researching each of the author's points. I discovered he picks and chooses whatever pieces will get his own moronic ideology across, no matter how much of the truth he has to leave out.I threw this book in the trash. I consider my time too valuable to waste on a hyped-up barroom pundit's half-truths."
1,"A new ""Worst"" book in my library","Who better to write a book about morons than Flynn? An abyssmally miserable book with so little substance I was surprised it didn't float out of my hands. It's a great resource for those looking for a plethora of examples of pitifully poor logic; Two wrongs don't make a right, non-sequiturs galore, red herrings - they're all there.It seems apparent the goal was to scoop up the easy money from the thin thinkers in our world. It certainly wasn't to write a scholarly treatise where the reader came away enlightened in the slightest way.I guess I have fallen into the category of ""moron"" by spending money on it and worse yet, reading it to completion. I'm embarrassed. Flynn should be too."
1,"At first thought this was a serious book, not made-up nonsense","I picked up this book from the library without noticing the endorsement from G. Gordon Liddy on the back. That should give you a clue about how ""right on"" this book is."
2,Biased,"Well written, but I thought this was going to be a critique of all ideologies, instead its just an extreme right winger complaining about left wing ideologies without being able to turn his gaze upon himself. Unable to acknowledge his own blind faith, the author is a hypocrite.The book should have been titled ""How left wing ideologies make people fall for stupid ideas""The book arrived quickly and was in very good condition."
3,Getting Real: Great concept; disingenuously illustrated.,"This book is useful for those who already ""get it"" that ideology is always a mixture of truth and nonsense, especially those who are onto the idea, but haven't yet articulated it well. Mr. Flynn provides in this book the tools and language to more fully develop this understanding.The author explores a valuable concept: We can avoid believing the lies ideology mixes with its truths by using our intellectual curiosity to question and examine all claims. Flynn teaches the method fairly well, but uses this platform to promote his own ideological agenda: bashing ""liberal"" thinking. Nearly all his illustrations target liberal causes. His only reference to a conservative ideological error is so obscure it's irrelevant. He ignores a treasure trove of conservative and neo-conservative ideological errors publicly paraded from the current White House administration. Adding this material for balance this could have made it a great book."
1,Buyer Beware,"I sent this book back after reading the chapter on Leo Strauss, which repeats the left-wing canard that America's policy in Iraq is the result of ""neocons"" ""hijacking"" the Bush adminstration to pursue the ""noble lie"" that deposing Saddam was necessary for U.S. security, when they really wanted to create some sort of Platonic empire. This chapter could have come right out of a hit piece by Pat Buchanan or Michael Moore. This is what Flynn thinks is debunking misguided ideologies? Vilifying the men trying to defend our country? I'll ask Abu Musab al Zarqawi to give him a call."
5,Must reading for anyone in a technology startup,"This books is a must read for anyone involved in a hi tech startup. I am with my second private technology company, and it provided some great insight into where we are, and what we need to do. For someone planning to start their own company or join someone elses, you should actively answer all of the questions put forth in the book. It will help you understand what the real chances for success are in a world full of great ideas without markets!"
5,less mess for mommy!,"The Wupzey food catcher is great!! Not only does it look good, it actually catches the food and toys that my little one drops off the highchair tray. It sure is nice to have a clean floor again!! I would recommend this product to anyone with a new eater in the family. I am also ordering several for shower gifts."
3,nice,"its nice Color , but the chair i have more big so i could not use this black cloth for it ,,,so no meaning i buy it , just lost money ,with international delivery ....so sad for it , i want to find other deali need chair with cloth together hope i can find cheap one i mean chair not this only cloth"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!,I'm glad I've got it on sale!!!!! It just doesn't make any sense and doesn't serve any purpose!!!!!!!!! Horrible design not thought through I WILL NEVER EVER RECOMMEND IT!!!!
5,1995 jimmy,"brand new, works great. this saved me a lot of money by ordering the part on here and doing it myself"
3,The info seems outdated,"When reading the book it seems that there was very little teamwork with blizzard and the writers of this book.Everything relates to WC3 and TFT during its release date but any new info after that time isnt in the book and sometimes disprooves what the book has to say. the only reason i bought this book is for WC lore. Luckily half the book has history on many of the places in Azeroth, hopefully Blizzards history and this books history match up."
3,Insufficient Information,"There was no indication that this bra came with 4 clasps. If you're short-waisted, like I am, you can't wear it. I've returned it to Spinatrix for an exchange over 6 weeks ago and haven't heard from them yet. They don't even have a valid phone number to call. I think I've been had!"
5,Cross Your heart Bra's,My wife has been using this product for 40 years and find's them to be terrific. As far as the experience of ordering the Bra'a thru Amazon we found the price to be exceptional as well as the great delivery time and service provided. My wife will definately continue to use the product as well as use Amazon for ordering in the future.
5,hard to find,I have been wearing this bra for years. It is the only one that fits right and comfortably........so why cant I find it in a 40B.I have worn others that i absolutely hate because I havent been able to find this style. Now that i have found it....you dont have my style....PLEASE HELP !!!
3,Only improved with 2.4,"This is really just ZoneAlarm's firewall combined with CA's personal anti-virus software. Installation was terrible (I had ZoneAlarm previously installed, and it conflicted). The 2.3 version was actually an ancient version of ZoneAlarm. It was recently updated to 2.4 which includes the curent ZoneAlarm."
3,I like Nod32/Kerio better,Nod32 and Kerio are better programs and secure you computer better. If M$ themselves use Nod32 and Kerio don't you think you should as well?
4,"Good, although does have a drawback","The anti-virus software, I think, is pretty much flawless, and absolutely terrific in terms of user-friendliness.However, the firewall is clunky and frustrating. There's no telling when or how it's going to react, and I wouldn't use it over better and cheaper spyware protection. I would say that the firewall really slows performance, but the anti-virus saves is lightning fast, so it's a give and take.Overall it's worth giving a try, but I recommend just getting the free subscription for a year off CA's website...you might be pleasantly surprised."
3,"Average, About Same As Norton","I was told by a friend that this product was way better than the norton one, but after trying both this one slows down your computer just as much. In fact, it is pretty much worthless active protection feature for internet browsing because it slows it down to a crawl (and I have a nice pentium 4 machine)."
5,If You Liked Requiem... You Will Love This :o),Requiem For A Dream is the most enticing film I have ever seen. This movie has literally changed my life. The movie is brilliant as so is the original score of the movie. Some listeners feel that this remixed release was a waste of time. I feel otherwise. I can't get enough of this movie and by releasing a remix of the original soundtrack just made it even better! The remixed soundtrack features some of the best of electronic artists and the soundtrack has a dancier feel to it- it is much more upbeat. Track 2 by Plant and track 10 by Josh Wink and probably the best tracks- in my opinion.If you loved this movie-- you gotta own this CD and the original as well.
1,Disappointing.,"It's horrible. I cannot believe I actually paid for it! I'm a big fan of the movie Requiem for a Dream and an even bigger fan of Clint Mansell's score, so the album of remixes caught my attention. After listening to the first two tracks I knew it would not meet my expectations. There are however a few exceptions, they are ""Ghosts in the Machine"" by Psilonaut and ""Aeternal"" by Paul Oakenfold. Those are the only DJ's on this album who, in my opinion, know what they're doing.This album is filled with mediocre mixing from substandard ""DJ's"" (also known as anyone with a drum machine and a computer). It's the equivalent to scribbling on Leonardo da Vinci`s artwork. I do not recommend this to anyone who really liked the original score."
1,Nope,"I'd agree with the reviewers who gave this album 1 or 2 stars. It's NOT an homage to Mansell or Aronofsky's brilliant film. It's a bunch of club producers doing club remixes. You may hear it thumping over the loudspeakers at your local dance club, played by some well-intentioned DJ who think he's digging deep, but it's doubtful the fans of the film will find as much depth in this album as in the original soundtrack.As a footnote, I got hooked on Mansell from Aronofsky's first film, ""Pi"". Definitely a must-own album and a must-see film."
2,Better Left Untouched,"If you're at all curious about this CD, then check it out before you buy it. I found it kind of boring.Some tracks seem only slightly altered (bits of dialogue thrown in, pulsing dance floor beats in the background, etc) while others are almost completely unrecognizable. And the tracks that are taken directly from the film (""Seacost Towers,"" ""112,"" ""Sara,"" etc) are just outtakes from the first, superior, original soundtrack. They're incidental, at best.So my whole problem is this: why take the stellar Requiem CD & mess with it? Mansell's haunting score is practically perfect! Why ruin a good thing? If it ain't broke, don't fix it!If you're a fan of the film's score then do yourself a favor & just buy the original soundtrack. I think this CD is only for die hard fans of these DJs (Paul Oakenfold, A Guy Called Gerald, Josh Wink)."
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"Well where can I begin? I did love the original soundtrack, and I've always been a fan of trance, but this CD still came to me as a bit of a disappointment. I'd say of the 12 original tracks on the album, I enjoyed only four or five. When listening to the CD, several of the new tracks give me that 'cheap, slapped on' feeling. Not really what I was expecting, but if you can get a good deal on it like I did, it's still probably worth the money. The Oakenfold and Delirium tracks were probably the tracks I enjoyed most. I wouldn't say it's a bad CD, but I feel that there was a lot of room for improvement. From such an awesome soundtrack, I expected much more in the remix...."
4,This Is Good,"I had been looking for this cd for quite some time when I finally found it, so when I listened to it, I put some thought into how good it was. This is a cross somewhere between a dance compilation and a normal soundtrack, and boy did they hit a good combination. I actually found this cd very 'chill' and relaxing, my favourite track being Body and Fear, by A Guy Called Gerald. If you like electronic music, or the atmostphere from the film, this cd wont disapoint you."
4,A powerful story of how modernization kills a civilization,"In many ways, this is Farley Mowat's most enduring book. It tells the true story of a Native American people killed by modernization--a brutal story that should make us think when we preach human rights and respect for others' cultures--not that our failings preempt us from speaking out, but as an injection of humility. I first read this book 20 years ago and it has stuck with me since them. I'm really sorry that it's out of print because it makes a great gift."
1,wrongful life,It is clear that the author has only money in mind to live the life he did-he never offered to help those people from starving.
4,One of the Best books on the subject!,"After being with my husband for a total of 5 years and having our first child, i found out he was having an affair with a girl from work. He eventually realized his mistake and came home, but we still struggled with this. we went to counseling, and this was the book our counselor suggested. it really helps you deal with what happened and why. If you are in love with your spouse who has been unfaithful, it gives perspective into both sides and makes you look deep into yourself to decide whether you can forgive or not. we have since had our second daughter and are looking forward to many happy years together with our family and without the ""affair"" hanging over our marriage. this book is a great one for anyone going through the feelings of mistrust, hurt, anger or anything with infidelity!"
1,Don't waste your money,I found this book to be of no help at all. Seemed to blame the woman for husbands affair. Gave the impression that they didn't work hard enough on their marriage to begin with. What a crock.
3,Scififile,"I have yet to be able to forgive much less forget. I have been in counseling and he has said he is sorry a few times but there is more I need to hear from him. He seems clueless as to what I need to hear from him. Can it be he so that dumb? He not only cheated, he told her about my personal self. These were things I told only him. I trusted him and now I am suppose to forgive and forget. ??"
4,Cute but overpriced.,"This is one of the sturdier princess headbands I've seen, but already pieces need hot glue touch ups. If it were for my kids, I'd stick with the dollar store for how quickly kids tear through things."
3,Winter Count,"The mood in Lopez's collection of short stories leaves one with this lingering feeling...one which I cant quite put my finger on. The mood set in his writing is calm, but the vivid descriptions of his words force vibrant, elaborate pictures to be sketched into the mind...so much so, that, although my body fell into a cozy, drowsy, PEACEFUL serenity as I read, my brain was still trying to cope with the force of colorful images invading it. A truly magnificent writer, one who incorporates the views of those from all around the globe, those of different backgrounds and lifestyles, and snugly wraps their individual stories together to form one great one through nature."
1,What Apple has Learned From Microsoft,"I purchasd an Apple from Amazon last month. That is an importnt number but more later on. My puchase has turned out to be a wonderfully attractive but quite expensive battery charger for my ipod. I have a case number with Apple that begins the day after I bought this computer. For the first two weeks the techies said I just had to read more or go to this site etc. Then I finnally got to tier 2. After spending the next few weeks doing this utility and this reinstall etc, the proble persisted. Okay I thougth, send me a new computer. Oh but wait, they said yu boufght it from Amazon, talk to them about the computer. By the way it is a smallproblem - it freezes when I try to open programs. Wonderful huh. her's where the story really gets good and teh 30 days becomes a magical number. Ever try to return something to Amazon after 30 days. Don't the transaction has been cyberspaced and you are left holding the bag"
2,rip off for pc users,"We bought the ibook to use with our Dell PC based on Apple claims about the ease of switch. Wrong! Several phone calls (which is what we wanted to avoid in the first place) to Apple to get set up with wireless network- Internet worked fine but file swapping has still been troublesome and still cannot simply share files. Local dealer said no problem to share printer on network.Wrong, in fact Apple support said they do not support that configuration! My Canon i960 is not listed on Mac drivers although I have downloaded a Mac Driver from Canon and installed it to some unkown place. So after a week and hours of struggle my wife's files are trapped in the ibook with no place to go. The computer is fine but don't go for it if you plan to share with your PC."
4,"Great computer, lousy speakers",I've had this computer for less than a week and must already return it for repairs or replacement because of constant grating intolerable feedback from the right speaker. Turning down the volume or muting does nothing to make it go away. The only way to get rid of it is to plug in a headset. Checked online forums and this is common. Apple should be ashamed to put such substandard equipment in a thousand-dollar machine.Otherwise it's great. I love the OS and the design. My first non-PC computer. But who can afford to spend the time setting up a new machine and then have to return it for such a stupid reason after so little time?P.S. Apple replaced it in short order and the new one works great.
5,Great Hardcore,"While I gave it 5 stars, I'll only recommend this to fans of real hardcore. I find every song enjoyable, while alot of my freinds like the first 2 tracks and say the rest all sounds the same. I also recommend atleast downloading ""Mailer, Meet Jim"" to any fans of the film ""28 Days Later"" (that's what the song is about)."
4,Interesting,"This book is very odd. It secretly builds up in the suspense. Some people would think it is way too detailed, but it is an interesting read. It is also very relaxing."
2,Classic melodrama,"I loved Wilkie Collins ""Women in White"" and ""The Moonstone,"" so was expecting good things with ""Basil"" but it was a bit too overly dramatic for my taste. If anything, its probably showing its age -- it was published in 1852. Today, we don't expect our men -- or women for that matter -- to fall into a swoon at the drop of the hat. I think the subject matter is still very current -- I think too many people fall in love with love, or lust, and marry people that they haven't really gotten to know and all too soon they feel trapped in a marriage that is not what they envisioned it would it (and which rarely is achievable). Can I recommend it? Not really, unless you enjoy reading books from that era."
3,A Great Baseball Book,"This read is terrific at giving an insider's account of a baseball season. Klapisch and Harper show not only what it is like to work as sports writers but also what it is like to cover a huge franchise in a big city where the media coverage is mighty. The stories about the 1992 Mets are interesting and many of the issues (money, teamwork, injuries, poor management) probably resonate to sports teams even today. This is one of the better sports books around."
3,How Hall of Fame talent made for a Hall of Infamy team,"Money isn't everything - and the money paid to the star talent the Mets had in Bobby Bonilla, Eddie Murray, Vince Coleman, etc., proves it. Especially when the money certain players earn is being spent on partying - one way to help your team finish last. Worth reading just for what Ron Darling said about Frank Viola's cross-country flight activities."
3,NOT like Starbuck's,"While this syrup, in and of itself, is tasty, if you are looking to duplicate Starbuck's White Choc. Mocha, you will be disappointed. This syrup is extremely sweet and, although we've tried various amounts in the drink and piled on the whipped creme, it is not a match...However, the drinks we make are not bad.. just not what we're used to."
5,Former Barista says...,I was a barista at a nice little non-franchise coffee shop for a year and a half and we used all Torani syrups and sauces. I LOVE the white chocolate sauce! It makes a very smooth white mocha that is just sweet enough without being overly sweet. My husband and I can't wait to make our own at home with this delicious sauce!
2,TOO SWEET! IT WAS GOOD BUT TOO SWEET,EASILY MIXES INTO ANYTHING...I ADDED THE RECOMMENDED BUT IT WAS NOT AS TASTY BUT THEN ADDING ANYMORE MAKES IT TOO SWEET
5,Great syrup; poor price,"Needed to replenish my stock and found the price is now $33.00 for a six-pack; up 46% from when I placed my last order December 17, 2010 ($22.50). This is ludicrous!"
1,Great sauce but...,"Well the sauce is great...I can make my ""Starbuck's"" style coffee white mocha for a fraction of price....except the sauce I bought expired 60 days after I bought it....I love mochas but come on....It should have been at least 6 months."
3,fair,"good, but not as good as the older version of the syrup (white chocolate) they had in the glass bottle; smaller size, less flavorful. Nice to have it in a multipack though."
1,Worst white chocolate ever,"I have had a venti white chocolate mocha (skim milk, no whipped cream) every morning at Starbucks for the last six years. After I bought a espresso machine, three weeks ago, I thought about making my own white chocolate mocha at home; so I decided to buy this product.This morning I read the instructions on the bottle and put two table-spoons of that chocolate in my cup of coffee... Then, three, four and, finally, some sugar to add some flavor. I put over 250 calories in my coffee for nothing. I never got white chocolate flavor at all.I am, to say the least, disappointed and, definitely, I will never buy (or recommend) this product again."
3,Sweetness,"Wanted to replicate Starbucks White Chocolate Mocha, but failed miserably. Product asks to be stored in refrigerator after opening, but becomes very difficult to take out after being refrigerated. Just order the $5.00 drink at Bucks and save the heartache! If you like sweet, this if for you!"
2,Nothing close ....,"While to some the cost of this item may be appealing the taste is less than desirable. It tastes nothing like the white mocha drinks that I have had in ""any"" coffee shops. And, I see several mentions of Starbucks ..... it is not even close. This is very artificial in taste and very runny. We spent a lot on our espresso machine so we are not going to skimp on flavors, beans etc. We use Fontana White Chocolate and while it does cost more it is what Starbucks uses per upper management from several locations - different label as Buck$ has their own labels. Fontana is what was in Starbucks years ago - same container - same label. A little more but also you use less syrup and the taste is spot on."
2,Not to Good,"I had actually bought this at a supermarket store and went home to make a white mocha, I usually drink starbucks so thats what i was going for. To me this prduct is gross and not that good. I really reccomend the FONTANA sauces and syrups ,that is the best product in my opinion and it is the same stuff starbucks uses."
5,Great White Chocoate Sauce !!,"This is not only some of the best White Chocolate sauce around, it is an excellent deal with the SUPER SAVING SHIPPING !! There was a mix up with my order and subscription, but AMAZON was great about correcting the problem. They had me reorder this item, ship it overnight and they would reimburse me for the shipping !! I then placed another order, AMAZON put the money for the Shipping back on my credit card within an hour. Excellent CUSTOMER SERVICE !! I will always check AMAZON for my needs before buying from anyone else cause they have great prices and they have the GREATEST Customer Service."
1,"Tank cracked open, replacement did, too! This time, bad deal.","Everyday I used two Holmes humidifiers, smaller ones than this model. I've used them for two or three winters, storing them in the summer, and I've had great results. That's why I usually buy a Holmes product, when the choice is to be made.This time, though...hmmm. Bad luck. At first, the unit seemed to run perfectly. Though, I did think that I heard a 'crack' when I was filling the tank, the first time. Anyway, after a week or so, all of a sudden I noticed that the humidifier had gone to 'reset' and the tank had cracked all over like broken glass -- a bit of water had leaked out, too.I ordered a replacement tank. That cracked after the first use.I'd been convinced that the problem was the tank -- not the main 'engine.' But, perhaps I got a bad unit and any tank would crack on it. There was nothing to indicate that, though -- it seemed to be running fine, until it cracked."
2,Not effective.,"Unit is brand new.Good features: Larger water tank, warm mist, water filter, water tank handle, 2 speeds, easier to clean, price.Problems: Too many instructions to complete minimal tasks; not good humidity coverage; noisy even at low speeds; won't reset; poor website support.Other cheaper units have been better (Vicks, Reli-On, etc)"
1,auto shut off function was for nothing,"i used holmes HM5305 warm mist humidifier which has mostly the same features as HM5601. we filled the tank full before going to bed, turned it on and set the humidistat in the middle setting. when we woke up, the water tank was melted and it was still halfway empty. what was the automatic shut off for? could have been a fire hazard."
5,Love it! Cleans easy with Holmes Humidifier Water Treatment,"After returning several warm mist humidifiers i got this one. usually I complain about the noise or not enough moisture, but this one is good with both. Cleaning isn't a problem. I use ""Holmes Humidifier Water Treatment"" in every tank. Got that at walmart 32 FL. OZ for like 3 bucks, only uses like one teaspoon per tank. Helps make clean up easy.***Edit update*** as of feb 2010 it is dead. need to send it in for repair."
1,What a disappointment!,"I made the error of ignoring some of the previous reviews that said this machine doesn't work. I had bought Holmes products before with a lot of luck, so I took my chances. The result? I got a piece of junk. It rarely ever works, and when it does, it generally stops well before the tank is even close to empty. We usually have to let it sit for hours to get it to work again. We finally decided to just return it."
4,SO FAR SO GOOD,"I HAVE ONLY USED THE HUMIDIFIERS (I HAVE TWO OF THEM) FOR TWO WEEKS, AND HAVE PUT THEM AWAY FOR THE SUMMER. I AM HAPPY WITH WHEM THEY ARE NOT DIFFICULT TO CLEAN, BUT AS WITH MOST HOT AIR UNITS WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHERE WE PLACE THEM BECAUSE OF THE GRANDCHILDREN."
3,Good for the price,"I bought this humidifier even though the reviews were pretty bad, however, I thought I would get it and see for myself. I have not had a problem with it and have used it for the entire weekend. It is easy to fill and to take care of so far no problems. I live in an apartment so this size works great for me."
1,The filters listed with this product don't fit,"The humidifier does a reasonable job set on high, but the tank only lasts about six hours in that case. If you set it to low it will last 24 hours, but don't expect it to service more than a small room in that case.Cleaning isn't bad. Get a little CLR and an old tooth brush to make your life easy.The filters Amazon listed for this product won't fit. If I had known that I would have purchased a different humidifier, but it isn't enough to make me want to send this one back....it is just an annoyance that I bought the filter, waited 10 days for it to arrive on a two day shipping charge, and when I got it it was all a waste of money.Peter"
2,not reliable,Works fine until it doesn't.First one died immediately. Replacement died when after two seasons.
1,WORST HUMIDIFIER,Getting the reset light to go off is harder than it should be. It is such a hassle to get the light off and get the thing started. It's an awful waste of time. This is a horrible product. I wouldn't give it to my worst enemy. Bionaire makes a much better humidifier.
3,It Does Seem To Actually Work,"I purchased this model for twice the Amazon price after seeing it available in a local store and obviously, before seeing it listed on Amazon. I needed to get some kind of humdifier quickly this winter for my apartment and so far, after three days, this model actually does seems to be doing the job.However, the instructions are extremely unclear (figured out much through trial and error), there is a setting (RESET) on the power knob with no explanation for its use nor of the differences between the LOW and HIGH settings. Finally, the humidity regulator (HUMIDSTAT) has no numerical indications on the dial to indicate ""statistically"" exactly what the setting is or should be as suggested by the instructions.Everything else is as advertised: easy cleaning, quiet, water filtering, etc.All and all, if you're willing to experiment a little with the settings and if this model has any life, it's worth the money."
2,Thorougly nonplussed,"This string tribute to Duran Duran is rather lackluster. It's not that the musicians aren't talented; it's just that Duran Duran's music - or at least most of the songs chosen for this release - doesn't translate well to the string-quartet format. A collection featuring all Duran ballads (Midnight Sun, Michael, Pop Trash Movie, Land, Winter Marches On, Matter of Feeling, etc.) would have worked better. If you're one of those fans who feels the need to own every release related to Duran Duran, it's not a terrible purchase to make, but for the casual fan, it's not worth it."
5,Best book ever,"wow this author must be a genius, this was mindboggeling. everyone buy 3000 coppies and make it a best seller."
2,"ugh, don't bother","The first book, ""Starfish"" was amazing, just a great read. This last book is horrible! Confusing, pointless, and extremely degrading, I wish I had never read it. I agree whole heartedly with ""aisian film c"" above! The rape and torture of one of the more sympathetic characters is what really pushed this book into the crapper for me."
3,Nice Remote but Burping/Churping Noise,"I've had this humidifier for about a week and use it at night in my bedroom. The remote is a very nice feature and will maintain the pre-set humidity level but there have been nights were it could not reach the setpoint and therefore stayed on all night. The only other drawback is that it makes this burping, churping noise while it boils the water. This can take some getting use to especially if you're use to sleeping dead quiet nights."
1,Stay Away,"Otherwise trustworthy Bionaire has produced a defective model. I've been through two of them now, both with similar problems. They tend to shut off despite enough water being in the tank, and no other visible problem. First one never worked right, the second lasted for two months before it continually flashed the reset light. Customer service could offer no solutions. Stay away!"
2,hard to clean,"In my opinion the reset problem and occasional burbling are not problems. My main beef is it's too hard to clean. A few weeks after replacing the filter the deposits start adding up. It has to be cleaned basically every time you refill the tank. Soaking in vinegar doesn't do much and requires a lot of vinegar as the entire bottom reservoir must be filled. The (phosporic-acid based) cleaner sold on the website is slightly better but in the final analysis you have to resort to hand scrubbing. And there's the hitch! You can't reach parts of the element, not even with a toothbrush. Why they couldn't center it just a little further away from the edge of the ""wall"" is beyond my comprehension. I spent more time last winter with the thing taken apart & trying various methods of cleaning than with it running. I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Not a good first impression...,"This ""nifty"" piece of machinery was the one choice at my local store and so, I got it. I really wanted to get the Air-O-Swiss one but alas, it cannot be found or shipped to Canada... weirdly.So far, I am less than impressed. Took me forever to even get it working. The constant resetting is tiring. I did find a solution (initial anyway) - you fill the tank but also fill the inside reservoir (where the round filter is) and then it works.The noise it makes is NOT easy to get used to, no matter how tired you are.I am trying it for one night, then if I can't sleep I will return it. It's not worth the money. My advice? Save up and get the Air-O-Swiss."
1,How does the firm get away with marketing this product?,"Several buyers/reviewers have complained about the tendency for this humidifier to switch to reset mode without any particular reason, requiring a manual restart. I incautiously ignored those warnings, purchased this model, and find it nearly useless. I have since purchased another brand of warm mist humidifier with a similar adjustible humidistat. (My more recent purchase lacks the relatively unimportant remote available on the Bionaire, but I'll take reliability any day over an added gadget on a machine with unacceptable and time-consuming random resets.) DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE."
1,Too puffy,I didn't like this shirt. Sent it back. Too puffy - like puffy paint - really rubbery and not attractive
4,A great resource for counseling pre-marital couples!,"I have used this resource as a pastoral counselor. The Four Gifts of Love are practical and beneficial to all couples, not just those preparing for marriage. The book is also an attractive one for gift giving!"
1,Bad Deal,"What make it a ""do not purchase item"":1. Shape of the badminton is slightly deformed, none of them is in perfect shape...so if you care about it, its a big let down.2. No grips...u wouldn't like the idea of playing it w/o grip.3. Shuttle that came along are poor quality...unfit to play."
1,crappy kindle format,"I bought this book on the kindle, and was extremely dissappointed t find that the format was mucked up. The translations and the original french in the hard copy of the book lie on opposite pages; in the kindle format, the french and the english are interspersed and the poems are completely unreadable."
1,bad quality edition,"this is a bilingual edition but the lines in French and in English are all entangled in a way that is impossible to read with a minimum of fluidity. Remember, this is a poetry book, so rythm is most important, which is completely lost in this lousy format!"
2,Rimbaud the Great in a Poor Translation,"Rimbaud's crackling poetic prose and gorgeous poetry is full of inventive energy in French: in this translator's English, it is flat, stilted, awkward and energyless. If you read French, the book's OK, because you have the original on facing pages. But if you read French, why buy this?"
4,now that's entertainment,"yep, that's what I'm talking about. Manhattan Transfer, classic xmas songs, ahhhh, now that's good stuff Maynard. Buy it you like it."
4,"Terrific, if not too much acapella...","These are astoundingly brilliant arrangements and the group sounds amazing here. For me, however, a little acapella goes a long way. Most of these tracks here are doubled, some even tripled, and the effect is that of a large group of people singing, which sounds beautiful, but I'd rather hear just the four voices backed up by a trio when it comes to these tunes. And sometimes it's better to execute a tune by just singing it straight ahead with no funky surprise key changes, but that's me being picky. On the other hand, the production is warm, personal and joyous. It's a great companion to their previous Christmas album."
4,Great Christmas CD,"This CD is *MUCH* better than their earlier ""The Christmas Album"". That album was way too ""normal""... This one swings a lot more, but is still kinda bland. The last couple of CDs have been a little less ""experimental"" than some of their earlier works. ""Vocalese"" is still kind of the standard I judge them by. This one does not rise to that level.I love Christmas music and if you do, too, this one is a good addition to your library of Christmas CDs."
5,A great Christmas album from MT!,"The Manhattan Transfer has done something I swore could not be done...they bettered their 1992 Christmas album!The album features the usual close, lush harmonies, and the beauty of the song ""Toyland"" will have to be experienced to be believed. While the work is not strictly ""a capella"" (in the style of the chapel; singing without instruments) the instrumental accompaniment heard throughout is understated and quietly supports the singers.Be warned ...""Good King Wenceslas"" features children's voices, which, while pleasant, are by no means professional (though there is one lovely young women's voice heard at one point...she has a definite gift)."
5,A winner at any price!,"This recording will enthrall you from the first swinging sounds of ""Jingle Bells"".The Manhattan Transfer has done something I swore could not be done...they bettered their 1992 Christmas album!The album features the usual close, lush harmonies, and the beauty of the song ""Toyland"" will have to be experienced to be believed. While the work is not strictly ""a capella"" (in the style of the chapel; singing without instruments) the instrumental accompaniment heard throughout is understated and quietly supports the singers.Be warned ...""Good King Wenceslas"" features children's voices, which, while pleasant, are by no means professional (though there is one lovely young women's voice heard at one point...she has a definite gift).I hope MT chooses to release this in America soon, rather than keeping it as in import only. But it does not matter...An Acapella Christmas is worth the the additional expense!"
3,Just OK.,"Nice creative twist on Jingle Bells. Otherwise, I was thinking, ""Is that all there is?"" (Apologies to Peggy Lee.) Still, if you like The Transfer and accappella as well, there are some delicious moments."
1,disappointment,I was extremely disappointed with this cd. I way overpaid for it ($37). Their pitch is really bad. I just expected so much better.
5,Very Effective!,"I have used this brand of Gaba for several years and find it to be the best! The product is fast-acting and effective. I have taken one in the am and one in the pm, as needed. I highly recommend Enzymatic Therapy!"
4,Deserves to be Read More Widely,"This collection contains all the work of the fine American poet Robert Hayden. An African-American raised in Detroit, Hayden's work includes, but is hardly restricted to, a number of fine to outstanding poems inspired by African-American history. His superb memorial poem for Frederick Douglass is a good example of work in this vein. There are also a number of fine poems drawn from his life experience and his Bahai faith. Overall, I prefer his earlier work, but Hayden was a consistently powerful and interesting poet throughout his career. Like many excellent American poets, his work deserves to be read more widely."
2,Less than optimal remixes of EBTG work,"This album consists of a couple of good remixes of work by Everything But The Girl, and the rest is made up of less than optimal remixes that don't do justice to the UK duo's work and even take away from the original magic they were able to create throughout the nineties when they were at the peak of their popularity. If you own the original albums (most of which come with an extra remix or two of the songs on it), you're fine. No need to bother with this one..."
4,EBTG Remixed,"This is a really cool laidback remix project from Everything But The Girl. I, unlike a lot of reviewers, did not own any previous albums of theirs. I basically knew EBTG from the song 'Missing' which is an absolutely beautiful classic song.That said, the rest of the album is somewhere in the middle of downbeat/ dance/ house music. It showcases the lead singer's great sexy smooth voice - she's better than Dido!The songs don't sound as if they've been done over a 10 year period - they all sound pretty modern. They definitely don't sound too dated.Overall, this is great stuff even if you're not familiar with original CD's. Good late-night listening."
4,A good investment for video fans (rookies also),"I am a complete ignorant in video edition and mastering. I was looking for a program that would help me edit and mix my home videos.Premiere helped me out a lot with it and it was easy to grab the basics. It is not complicated to start using it and in no time you'll be adding effects or transitions to those videos of yours.You do not need a super PC with lots of RAM to use it (128 is enough for starting) although it's advisable with these kind of programs to have many Megs of RAM backing you up.You can import from digital cameras, VHS, and almost every known format (AVI, MOV, MPG, etc) and export your projects to almost every format too. You can add extra images or sounds to enhance your own ""pieces of art"".I can never forget that huge big smile on my face after editing a home video and watching it on TV with transitions, still images, and recorded comments on it! It felt so good!"
4,Mini Final Cut.,"Oh man, was I relieved when I found Premier 6.5 (after using Crapinnacle Studio 8). You'll find almost all of Final Cut's and after effects's pros here. The whole package, the great effects, includig Adobe's well known and fabulous color distortion and everything. I reccommend this. Totally."
3,"Define ""anticlimax""","The book started out great -- it didn't even lag through the middle! I eagerly flipped the pages until I got to the ending, and when I was done reading that... I threw the book against a wall. This isn't a spoiler, but man! That ending was weak and amateurish. I just hope he uh... comes up with a sequel... because there needs to be some closure to this whole thing..."
1,"Very, VERY disappointed","I had great hopes for this book. I usually really enjoy anything dealing with a new twist on the battle between good and evil, angels and demons. I thought this book was terribly unoriginal (demons with horns, bat wings, hooves and ""brick red"" skin? ....) with moments of inspiration. The shadowdance was interesting in that the author compares it to martial arts kata ....The angel Zoel and demon Asdeon, creatures who should be capable of vast unimaginable powers, are reduced to a bickering sidenote to the story. Asdeon, especially, was disappointing, a second-rate dandy spouting unfunny quips at the stoic and beautiful Zoel. .... The two battling ""Grand Dukes of Hell"" were nothing more than giant thugs, clawing at each other like Godzilla vs. King Kong. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. ...."
3,"Well, if you want a quick read that isn't too bad","I like horror novels, I like fantasy novels and so I figured I'd give ""Hell on Earth"" a try. I read this book in a few hours, it's not complex or hard to understand and the print is large. It's a good day at the beach book. ""The Stand"" it's not.This isn't a bad book at all, it's entertaining and scary and suspenseful even. The writing is pretty good and I think that a few books down the line could be really good.The book takes us through the lives of several characters - Colin the mysterious demon hunter, Liz the former tabloid writer who is being stalked by a serial killer and Terry, the bodyguard with a hidden past. Each of their lives becomes connected as they move toward a demonic convergence with apocalyptic proportions.Amusing, entertaining and an easy read."
1,Not worth my time,"When I read the title and jacket I was very interested. After the shocking first chapter which was pretty gross I was very disappointed. The book was filled with ""demonology"" terms and was very fustrating. I keep flipping back pages looking for the explainations to terms that were constantly thrown out as if the readers had a B.S in the history of spells and magic. With the exception of the opening chapter and a suprise near the end, the book was very disappointing. To sum it all up. This was the first book about Colin( the main character) but I felt like I was reading a sequel and was totally out of the loop. Too many questions and not enough answers is how I felt when I finished. The door was left open for a sequel but I won't be reading it."
2,*yawn*,"Michael Reaves just tries too hard. The premise of the book and the first chapter certainly intrigued me, but the rest of the book is just poorly executed. The plot's okay, but always left me with a sense of ""Why?"". Although multi-character story lines can be very rewarding, here they are just convoluted and muddy the waters. The (merciful) ending of the book was such a amaturish let-down I, truly, drove straight to Good-Will and dropped my copy of the book into the donation bin. If you want books on a very similar theme (I'm sure Reaves was attempting a knock-off), please try the novels of Neil Gaiman. Gaiman is a brilliant writter who pulls off multi-arc biblically-obsessed stories without effort. Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from Hell on Earth as humanly possible."
4,Very good story!!,"Reaves has created an outstanding character in Colin, a modern day sorcerer with a mysterious purpose and an interesting past. The author weaves the fantasy story quite well into our current time period. I'll leave the story synopsis to others, but if you like fantasy or demonology or sorcery, you'll enjoy this book! It moves right along, after a bang up beginning, and comes to a somewhat satisfying conclusion. Leaves you wondering about the circumstances, past and future, of some of the characters, particularly Colin and his interesting past, but that's a good thing. A sequel is a sure thing, and that's a good thing also!!"
4,A good book that could have been better,"After reading the jacket of this book I wondered why I wasn't in the horror section. Once I had read the book I realized why. The amount of quasi-ceremonial magick references in this book was staggering. It wasn't entirely necessary neither were some of over used mentioning of GREAT COSMIC POWER. This book would have profited from it's writer taking a tip from the content in the book and making more Lovecraftian and less like something Neil Gaiman would have written in High School. It was a good book, don't get me wrong. I just would have hoped the author could have taken some time and made it a GREAT BOOK!"
5,Roy Orbison's Best CD!!!,"I bought this because it had ""My Prayer"" on it. If you have never heard this song, you are really missing the most beautiful, magical voice ever! I get chills every time I hear it. There are a lot of other songs on this CD that give me the chills too but My Prayer is my all time favorite. Roy Orbison was the best singer ever (sorry Elvis). You won't be sorry you bought this one.I pay for Syrius radio (spelling?) but it is a waste because now that I have this CD, it is all I want to listen to."
4,Roy Orbison Hits,"There were many hits on these CD's, but half of the songs I'd never heard of before. I burnt my own CD with just the hits and they all fit on one disc. Having said that Roys voice was so great that even the songs I'd never heard were very good. What a talent to be gone so young. The slow sad songs can make you get misty, anyone who can listen to ""Mama"" and not feel his pain is missing something."
5,Husband Loved it....,"Husband Loved it....oder it for him.....like there is only one Bee Gee's for me, there is only one R.O....enjoy..."
3,Not enough hits,"I was a youngster when most of these song came out, I don't remember Roy releasing any song on the first disk. They are all re-makes. And the one song I wanted wasn't there. I had it on 8 track in 69 and would listen to it repeatedly speeding up I5. Nothing. He sang about his 'big motor turning'. That's what I had in my 69 Camaro. Still have the car, the engines even bigger and I still have the 8 track in the car,,,,,but no song."
3,Roy Orbinson - 50 all time greatest hits,I am very disappointed in this product as only about half of the first CD are Roys original songs. The balance are remakes of other songs and frankly alot did not even sound very good. I grew up listening to his music in thesixties and what was on the first Cd I loved but the second CD leaves a lot to be desired. I am a big fan of his but only about a third of this is worth listening to.
4,Memories of Roy,The CD was good. Great selection but also had a few forgetable songs that didn't make it.
3,WHERE'S THE ACTION!!!,"This was a disappointment to me. The Carrier series has been action packed and militarily intense up until ""Alpha Strike."" Most of the book is about diplomacy between the U.S., China, and Vietnam with not a lot of air or sea battles taking place. Another problem I found was the editing. There is one point in the book where it is July 3 and 1800 hours local time then a few pages later the date is the same and the times earlier. What happened? Speaking of what happened, where is Willis E. Grant, a.k.a ""Coyote."" Hopefully, the next book in this series, ""Arctic Fire"" is a whole lot better."
5,For My Collection,"There are 28 of these in the collection. I purchased this to help fill my collection. Arrived quickly, exactly as advertised."
2,A disappointment,"This book was a big disappointment, Just too much diplomacy and no action at until the last 3 chapter in the book."
5,Excellent Guitar Work,"I totally agree with Mott. Peter plays his [REAR END] off (pun intended) on this one. Wide variety of flavors-jazz,funk,rock,ambient. It's all great!"
4,OK but not amazing,"If this were your only maze toy, it would be fine, but as we already have one, this adds nothing more. We are big fans of Educo in general and already have their amazing Down on the Farm Discovery Box maze, which I highly recommend. We decided to purchase another maze toy since our 7 month old daughter likes the Farm Discovery Box so much, and we didn't want to have to lug it up and down the stairs. For some reason, I expected this toy to have additional features (like some kind of propelling mechanism) but perhaps that was my misreading into the name ""countdown"" and the rocket theme. In actuality, it is a simple maze with no additional features, and none of the interesting add-ons that the mazes that sit on top of a box offer. Also, some of the pieces are a material (rubber?) other than wood. We will probably keep it, but if I were to do it again, I would choose one that sits on a box and offers some games on the box faces along with the maze."
5,An Entertaining Read,"Society has changed much since Penrod was written, but it is still a humorous and whimsical tale of the adventures of a young boy. Some parts of the story reflect the different culture of the day, but not in an offensive way. Those who remember and enjoyed ""Calvin and Hobbes"" and ""Dennis the Menace"" should read this short book. It was satisfying to read a book without violence, politics, sexual overtones or a hidden agenda, just a boy being himself."
5,wish I could give it a 7,"This is an awesome book, written by a master of our language. Tarkington ended this very funny book in the best possible way. Read this book."
1,Poor Copying,this is not a paperback but rather a lousy job of photocopying a poorly typed manuscript of Tarkington's classic. Just a pile of letter size sheets with print so washed out it was difficult to read. My first Amazzon disappointment. Very pleased with the ease and fairness of the return handling.
4,It is what it is...and it's also unforgettable.,"The reviewers who point out Tarkington's racism are certainly correct, and even as a schoolboy 50+ years ago it made me very uncomfortable. But his ability to penetrate the mind of an adolescent is remarkable, and the ""Great Tar Fight"" sequence has to be one of the funniest episodes in all of literature."
5,"90% accurate and a 3 hour charger, Well worth it....","When Roomba is getting low it WILL seek out its home base. You do however need to place the base in the middle of the cleaning area with plenty of visiblity. If this is done, Roomba will find its way home. This feature is also nice because it will charge the Red in 3 hours instead of 7.If you have an L shape floor, well that is what the virtual wall is for. For example, you clean one area (living room, Dining room) and then you do the other area (Family room, Kitchen). Not to tough to figure out."
3,"Nice, but not as useful as I thought","The base works just fine, but wihtout the scheduler, your Roomba will not resume cleaning once it is finished charging, making the self-charger useful only if you want to come home and find it charged to put in another room."
1,Roomba Self-Charging Drive-On Home Base,"Does not work at all. I purchased a Roomba vacuum not long after they first appeared on the market. This Roomba does not seek out the home base and further, does not charge the Roomba when I physically place it on the home base. Take care in ordering. It does not work and Amazon does not allow a return if 30 days have passed."
3,Home base for litttle red robot,"I think the home base is important to have with the litttle red robot, but it seems to want to go back to the base than do the complete cycle. Maybe those two should't plaly togeather so much, bad infulence......"
3,It could work better,"This dock came with my new Roomba (which has a swivel front wheel). It's not a great design. The Roomba can move it around when undocking or docking. I've managed to get it to work well with a non-slip placemat and using double-side tape to stick the dock to the mat (with the back to the edge)... the Roomba now has the drive wheels on the mat and can't slide the dock that's now fixed to the mat.I've also had the problem with the Roomba not being able to find the dock... when watching I get the impression it just does it's random cleaning movements until either the battery dies or it accidently finds the dock.Lastly, I wish they sold just the dock without the power block as a less expensive upgrade for the basic Roomba."
2,"too much money, and not that great","I had bought this thinking that I wouldn't ever have to plug roomba in to charge. That didn't happen. If Roomba is in another room when the battery is running low, he won't make it to the charger. So you still have to pick it up and carry it to the charger, so what is the point? (I have an ""L"" shaped living area, and it isn't even that big)You have to ""babysit"" roomba anyway. Sometimes his back cover falls off and you have to put it back on (very annoying, why won't it stay on?) Roomba can also get stuck in places or pick up something you forgot to get out of the way and run until the motor burns out (at least they gave me a replacement)So it just isn't worth the money. I just bend over and plug it in myself and saved the 50 bucks."
1,Bad,"You could read my review on this writers book, Leaving Jeremiah, but he can't write. He just has no talent at it. For both books, he paid people to write good reviews. He's a nice kid, and my review is entitled ""Know This Kid"" because I've met him, and he's nice and good at music, but he can't write. I'm a kid who's actually wiriting a book, but isn't finished yet, and I'm careful to avoid sucking at writing like him."
1,You people crack me up,What do you people bother reading this book seeing how badly its rated? You people are so funny!
2,not commercial grade,"It is a fan, it moves air, it is reasonably quiet. There is nothing commercial grade about it. It is also not worth the $70.00 price I paid. This fan makes me feel like a sucker. It is my fault for not reading the the reviews. I assumed 5 stars meant everything was perfect. When something isn't as advertised, it shouldn't be given 5 stars. this fan is 90% plastic. Hopefully it is the motor that is what I paid for. This fan appears to be more of a $20-$30 fan.I would pick a different fan for less money. It works, but it's not commercial grade. I'm going to try it for a few days, but I will probably return it for a fan of the same quality, but for $40 dollars less."
3,Industrial grade it's not,Unfortunately I ordered this fan before going to Lowe's and purchasing the same exact fan which is LASKO brand and owner of Air King for less than $30 sales tax included. This is not a commercial grade fan. I like it but wouldn't buy it again at over twice the cost from Air King.
1,cheaply made,Had 2 of these go on me now. They're cheaply made. One had an electrical problem. The other had the plastic piece break that turns the fans sideways. The price is some of the highest that I have seen out of all oscillating fans. I thought I was paying for quality. I was wrong. I'm tempted to just throw my 3rd one in the garbage before it goes too.
1,"Mush, water, and not processed?","No doubt this is a poor product. When you are done draining out the water to make your sandwich, the chicken amounts to about half this small can. Also, it is a very milky white in color, even for white meat, which makes me wonder if it is not processed. There is nothing on the can that states it is not processed, or all natural, which allows Hormel, if this is the case, to use processed parts of the chicken. Just the mush and too much water is enough to say goodbye to this rip-off."
1,calling this chicken is too generous,"This should be called mush in a can. Why is the low sodium version so unrecognizable, grainy and mushy without the chunk qualities you expect when opening canned chicken. I need low sodium fast lunch solutions and was hoping this would help. What a rip off, it looks like they canned the leftover dredges from their premium breast of chicken and slapped a low sodium label on it. Shame on you Hormel!!"
1,Awful! Do not buy!,"I like to use canned chicken to make chicken salad sandwiches for lunch now and then. I was very disappointed in this canned chicken. It tasted horrible, which is surprising in just white meat. I do not know how they could have so thoroughly removed all flavor from the chicken and am not sure I want to know. I realize it's salt free but that usually doesn't seem to matter with other brands as I flavor it when making the salad. I usually like Hormel products so it was very disappointing. I will not be buying it again. Yuck!"
2,Different,Being that this is just an accelerator it is just white so no bronzers. Its not a very smooth lotion and the smell is kind of weird like chemicals but not very strong at all which is nice so after you tan its still not strong. And I was just looking for something to give me a good base tan becase im not very dark so I could work my way up to bronzers without looking orange. But I dont really feel like this did anything.
4,works well,It does inhance your tan more than no lotion at all. It doesn't have an odor and it does not stain your hands or leave them slimey.
2,"I guess it's good, by other reviews","Got this as it doesn't have bronzers, but it smelled a bit off, so not sure of quality/age. Not impressed with performance moisturising-wise. The smell is why I wouldn't buy it again, for sure!"
1,Stinks!!!!,"This stuff smells sooo gross! I am definitely disappointed. I only used it once and it might as well be thrown away. When you smell it in the bottle it isn't great, kind of coconut mixed with something. But once it is on your body it smells NASTY. I kept thinking I smelled puke, and it was me!! Not sure about how it works as an accelerator because I can't get past the smell. The one time I used it, it wasn't noticeable and definitely not worth the price you pay by stinking. I would not recommend to anyone. Guess that's what you get for buying a product like this online. Yuck."
4,classic cd a must have,this is a great cd ! My favorites are betty blue and grey . Grey can also be heard on cky4 . This is a good band . If you like this try H.i.m. you'll love them also try weeping willows.
5,the very darkness we want,"everyone who has already listened the album doesn't need further explanation that the 69 eyes is the one of the best gothic bands in the world. you can feel the power and love behind their darkness and sadness(maybe not necessarily sadness)they desire the best reward, but their not being exposure makes them more beautiful!"
5,Fave 69 Album,"Old school 69 Eyes is great. After all, who doesn't love 'Mr. Pain'? The band's more recent stuff is ok, but nothing that I've listened to twice lately. For the most part they've sort of fallen off my radar.This older album however, Paris Kills, is in my humble opinion, their best album to date and a personal favorite. I suppose this is merely for the fact that I lean more towards the ways of Type O Negative, so yeah the bias is there.This album is, as advertised, goth n' roll. A little smokier and slower too. The copy I have now has scratches from so much play, so I'll be getting another.Go sample a few tracks, and see if this is the kind of 69 Eyes you prefer.(I'm not going to slice and dice the songs apart with my imaterial opions.) Decide for yourself. It's all just a matter of personal taste."
5,it kills to be this good,"this album is excellent. the vocals are carried over from blessed be but a bit more developed. the opennings of each track is very tragically intense. this album is a great way of showing the bands trek as musicians. my favorite songs on here at ""dance d'amour,"" ""crashing high,"" ""radical,"" and ""still waters run deep."" ""crashing high"" has a very beautiful openning that leads into jyrki's first words. the chorus is melodically bent to perfection. ""dance d'amour"" is a song to be played on a moonlight dinner, preferably a gothic marriage reception. this album greatly captures the essence of vampyric romane and gothic love. the helsinki vampires are the truest (LoL Christian...TROO) gothic/glam rock metal band."
5,Well made - good price,This tool fulfilled my expectations. I used it to drag 6 yards of concrete into a footing form. No problems.
3,Noit bad at all,"Its a cheap low budget flick, Yes, the actors suck, Yes. But lets keep things in there proper prospective. Your watching this for the Martial Arts/fighting, and the action. The fighting was pretty good. What blows me away is, this is the 5TH different movie the same story and fighting scenes. Bloodfist 1 with Don Wilson, Angel Fist with Cat Sassoon, Full Contact with Jerry Trimble, Dragon Fire with Dominic La Banca,and Now Bloodfist 2050 with Matt Mullins. All the same story, all the same movie almost word for word.. Its unbelievable."
1,Also never shipped .,"I agree with ""Phil Man"" of Ohio. I ordered despite bad reviews and had the same problem. My credit card was billed the day I ordered but a month later my battery still was not shipped due to ""manufacturer delay"". The claim on Amazon's site still says that it usually ships in 2 days. I cancelled my order even though my Roomba still has a dead battery."
2,Roomba 4905 Battery,"Works great when you first get it. But, only lasts about a year. Should be of higher quality."
1,Not An iRobot Battery!,"This battery didn't work. I charged it for the initial 16 hours, and tried to run my Roomba. It worked for about 10 minutes, and then it acted sporadically giving me many different error messages. After contacting iRobot customer service, they informed me that the battery was not made by them and that this battery could potentially have messed up by Roomba. Very frustrating!"
4,battery does what it does!,Cheaper than irobot sight but they need to improve battery life...mine last about 10 months using my roomba 2/day 7days/week. I know it's meant to go one hour for 3-5 years but that's just how I use mine.
5,Made the old Rumba new again,"My Rumba began to malfunction after one year. After trying everything, doing a ""super charge"" leaving it plugged in for 3 days, and taking it apart for a detailed cleaning, etc., it continued to malfunction. Finally, I purchased the new battery and now it's like new again."
5,Roomba take over vacuuming job,Roomba is wonderful--it vacuums while I am doing other chores--such as reading or fixing dinner.
4,My roomba runs again!,"My original roomba battery lasted for about two years. The performance of the battery really degraded over the past six months, to the point where it would only run for a minute before dying. Very frustrating! I found a review posted here about ""renewing"" the battery and tried it, but the battery was dead.The new battery is great! My roomba is back to running for 1.5 hours (on a mix of hardwood, tile and carpet). It is also running faster. The battery was exactly what I wanted and arrived when promised."
1,Hit or Miss,"Bought a pair of these batteries for two robots that i own. One battery has been working like a charm. The second battery would not hold a charge. I sent it back and it was replaced very quickly. However the replacement didn't hold a charge either. I sent that one back also. They would not send me a third replacement, so I had to get a refund. I am now in the process of ordering a battery from another supplier. Hopefully that one will work.The price is right on this site, but not if the batteries are not going to work."
1,"Nice price, but very, very short life span","I have ordered replacement roomba batteries from these guys twice and both times the batteries barely lasted more than 6 months;. The first time I figured it was a fluke, the second time I contacted them and was told their warranty is only for 6 months (hmmm, coincidence?). ALthough the price is a bit cheaper than buying direct from iRobot, iRobot has a 1 year warranty and every battery I've bought from them has lasted well beyond that period. All in all, I ended up spending more money buying from these guys since it died so quickly."
1,"no no no, do not buy this product!!!","The seller, Allergy Be Gone, is not shipping the item that is being advertised here, they are substituting a cheaper knock off battery. Amazon has been made aware of this. Amazon?? Are you going to act on this????"
2,Roomba Battery,"The battery died after 3 wks. I think it may have been defective, but not willing to go through all the inconvenience of returning it, etc."
5,better than original battery,"It worked as I had hoped it would. Long run time, now it remains to be seen how long the battery will survive use."
5,Replacement battery got the Roomba running again,"This battery got the Roomba running again. I didn't get many run times from the first battery so I had to buy a replacement. I know I will get more time from this one beause I will only let it run for 30 min instead or tun till it is dead. I get almost the same cleaning any way, and I know battery will last for many more cycles. It is not good for any battery to be run dead before charging each time. You will get many more cycles if each cycle is only a partial cycle, and not a complete discharge."
3,I wish I didn't have to find out how good it is,"Buying a new battery brought my dead Roomba back to life. So for that, it earns five stars. But I have to pull my review down to three stars because of the fact that I even needed a battery. The original apparently identical battery that came with our robot was dead in less than a year of operating the Roomba two or three times a week. That was pretty disappointing performance for a product that costs $50 to replace. I guess I need to budget $50 every nine or ten months! But it is good to once again have my little circular friend back on the prowl for dust bunnies. . . ."
5,Works as Described,"Bought a refurbished roomba for 50 bucks, only thing wrong was a dead battery, bought one of these babies and it works like charm, definitely recommend."
3,High cost of convenience,"I think these are expensive enough to last twice as long, but they dont.....works well until it dies....."
2,I Got A $50 Lemon!,"I bought an extra battery as spare. Unlike the original one that came with my Roomba, this one doesn't always charge in 3 hours. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't, it doesn't matter how long it is connected to the charger, it remains in a barely charged (orange light) state. I have to take it off the charger, run the vacuum once to the end song, plug it in the charger again and pray that it will work this time.Too bad I didn't test it when I received it from Amazon. I put it on the shelf and waited a year after my original battery died before I used this one. Moral of the story - test the battery as soon as you get it. Don't assume it will work because it might not. I paid $50 for this lesson.Roomba should either address this production issue or allow second sources to make this battery."
5,"It's a battery, what else would you expect?","After 3 years, and oddly enough three different replacement robots, the battery finally lost its ability to charge. Being a product that has one model made by one manufacturer, I was very surprised to find the battery at a significantly lower price at Amazon. The product works as one would expect, it charged right up and it runs my Roomba, as long as it doesn't blow up like a laptop battery, I will continue to enjoy a product that makes my life a little easier. Now if they could come up with a robot that washes and folds laundry, now that would be a ""must have"" product."
1,This is a defective product,"Bought this battery and most of the cells in the battery died within a month and a half. The original battery lasted almost two years (running at least 5 times a week. This one was a bit less expensive, but clearly is MUCH lower in quality. I would definitely avoid it."
5,Old Roomba revived from the dead,"I wasn't quite sure why my generation 2(?) Roomba would just shut down right after starting, but I suspected the rechargable battery. This battery works almost twice as good as the original one. 49.99< 279.99.... You know a brand new Roomba!"
1,Held it's charge for 2 months...,"I bought this to replace an original dead batter for the Roomba. I followed the charging procedures and then let it do it's thing. The battery lasted for about two months. After that, the roomba would dock and charge full, then when I told it to clean, it'd start cleaning for 15 secs, then it'd start beeping and die. Now my Roomba just sits on the ground collecting dust."
5,Easy to install and much more power,This battery pops right in to the Roomba--no tools or disassembly required to install it. The improvement in charge life is noteworthy over the battery that came with the Roomba at the time of purchase. I can now use the Roomba to clean 3 rooms on a charge instead of one. Totally pleased with my purchase!
1,What went wrong,"The APS 4905 I purchased worked for about two weeks. After that, nothing. The charger blinks continuously when this battery is placed in it, but the stead light that indicates that it's charged never comes on. (The recharger works fine with two other batteries.) We also have an older recharger that recharges the battery while it's in the Roomba. That doesn't work, either.How can I return or exchange this?"
3,Batteries for a Roomba,Delivery was good. After several uses the batteries still did not last quite an hour. I thought they were supposed to last up to 2 hours.
2,Robot Roomba,"That was a long time ago. It fit in my machine, but the battery did not last as long as the original battery, so, it is in the closet and not used."
1,Did not last,"The battery did not hold a charge past a few months. As a result, my Roomba sits in a corner as a paper weight."
3,Did the Job,I have had my roomba since 2005 and it finally bit the dust I think. This battery lasted about a year before it started noticeably having a shorter life. Now it only lasts minutes. The original battery lasted 4 years. I may try to buy another battery to see if the roomba still lives.
1,Not iRobot as advertised/product photo - overpriced aftermarket knock-off,"IT IS NOT THE OEM iRobot BATTERY advertised! I purchased this specific battery because it was the least expensive OEM battery I found (Listed as iRobot plus iRobot battery photo). It is an aftermarket knock-off. Amazon sent a Chinese off brand ""DucGreen"". Similar aftermarket batteries can be purchased elsewhere for $10-$15 less. It provided 45 minutes operation with my 400 series Discovery after a full charge. I will return it. Check this one if you don't mind an inexpensive, aftermarket replicaCard Tenergy Replacement Battery (Grey Color) for iRobot Roomba 4905 400 series Vacuum CleanerAt least you will get what you paid for."
1,Dead Battery,I received a dead battery! I used the roomba first-time charging instructions since no instructions came with the battery. The battery will not charge with either of two roomba units that I have. I e-mailed Alfaoutlet using the Amazon link and have not heard anything from either one on this issue. I do not recommend buying this product. You are better off purchasing from iRobot.
4,IRobot replacement battery,"This is the second 4905 battery I have ordered. The first didn't hold a charge very long. The latest one will do the entire downstairs(4 rooms) and return to the home base. I did follow the charging instructions to the ""T"" and I think that has helped."
4,"So far, so good..","Like several others who reviewed this battery before me, I was a bit disappointed in the short life of the original Roombas battery (9 months). However, the price for a replacement on Amazon was significantly less than on Roomba's site. It arrived timely and so far (3 weeks into it) is working well. I just hope that I don't have to buy a new battery every 9 months."
5,Genuine iRobot battery at a good price,"This is a genuine iRobot APS battery for the Roomba. You can buy it here for about what you can expect to pay for an ""after-market"" battery elsewhere. Good deal."
4,Vacuum,Nice not having to push a vacuum around. Has had battery issues but vacuum was refurbished replaced the battery with new and seems great so far.
4,Fast delivery.,"Fast delivery. For some reason, the battery did not last as long as the original comes with Roomba"
2,It is an expensive toy,"I have two Roomba's, after one year of good operation they have been having battery problems. One Roomba was returned for refurbishment. They have good customer service, if you pursue them. The newly returned Roomba still has battery problems. The housekeeper which was very excited when I bought the Roomba now uses the vacuum cleaner."
1,Don't buy a roomba,"My $200 roomba which I loved to use daily for picking up dog hair stopped charging after 8 months. I was appalled to find that a new battery was $50+ and delayed buying one for a long time. I finally caved, got the new battery, charged it and used it once for 20 minutes, and it hasn't charged since. What a disappointment and waste of money."
1,Roomba is not worth repairing,"The Roomba products are not much more than short term gadgets. Initially I was very happy with mine and even convinced 3 of my friends to purchase as well. One by one, theirs started to fail and a repair shop could not be located. Mine failed in just under 3 years of light usage. Based on the ""symptoms"", I purchased a battery which seemed like the most likely solution. What a waste of money! Now I am finding information saying that they are trying to sell some sort of chip or module to repair the problem ..... no thanks!"
4,Fine Roomba battery replacement,"I ordered this replacement battery through Amazon.com recently. The shipment arrived in a timely manner. The shipping sleeve that it came in was slightly roughed up, but there's no damage whatsover to the batttery itself. There is no installation instruction with the battery, however it really is one of the simpleist battery change-outs going, so no problem there.It came with some battery charge. As expected it did not run too long on that charge. A full charge (I do not have a Roomba quick-charger) the Roomba ran a bit longer. I must admit that the short run concerned me a little. However, I've gone through two more charging cycles and the battery life extends noticeably. All in all I'm please with the purchase and delivery service.I wouldn't mind if the battery were somewhat less expensive though.I have an earlier model (gray) Roomba which does a very good job."
1,"2 months, not 2 days. Amazon is maliciously misleading!!!!!!!!!!","I ordered this on Nov 9th. The advertisement said it would be available in 2-3 days. So 8 days later I check on my order. It turns out it is not available until Jan. 19th!!! I pointed this out to Amazon but they have still not updated the web site to reflect the long wait. They know it is not available but are still advertising ""Availability: Usually ships within 2 to 3 days"" I think this is maliciously misleading. Amazon knows it is a problem, they need to fix the advertisement now!!!"
5,Adds new life to a tired roomba!,"I was getting concerned because our roomba was hardly able to clean a room anymore because the battery was starting to get old. I got the new battery, and WOW, the battery lasts longer than I think the original one did when I bought it."
5,iRobot Roomba APS 4905 Battery,My Roomba was acting a littly goofy lately. The runtime was sometimes only 10 seconds and other times it would run for a normal amount of time so I decided to replace the battery. The new battery fixed all my runtime problems so I am happy with it. The previous battery only lasted about 1 year so I hope this one lasts a little longer since they are expensive.
5,iRobot Roomba replacement battery,"Our Roomba had become sluggish, and re-charging was becoming an adventure in trying to guess how long the next charge would last. The replacement battery pack made a world of difference. Our Roomba is back to its original self."
4,What can you say? It's just a replacement battery.,"Anyone who has a Roomba already knows what this battery does. For me, my old one finally stopped holding a charge after years of use, so it's nice to have a Roomba that runs for hours again."
1,misrepresented product,"Amazon's sub-contractor sent me the knock off Chinese Roomba battery and not the APS battery which I paid more for. When I complained, this contractor told me to return it but I didn't want to pay for the extra freight. The cheap replacement battery had free shipping but the reviews showed it didn't last long so I bought the real battery replacement instead which cost more to ship. I didn't fee like I should have to pay freight twice when it was their fault in sending me the wrong battery but they took this stance. It was not worth the effort and mental energy to fight them so I kept this battery instead. I know Amazon would have handled this better directly but I don't know how to contact Amazon as the website keeps directing me back to this contractor."
5,"Roomba came quickly, worked great","The iRobot Roomba APS 4905 battery we ordered was a good price, was delivered quickly (especially for the Christmas season) and worked great! We were very happy with our purchase."
3,Longevity Lacking,"Battery doesn't last very long on a full charge. I'd estimate about 75% power of a battery from the manufacturer. I'll pay full price next time, and go to Roomba to purchase."
2,Battery freshness questionable,"I received my Roomba battery from go-vacuum. I followed the standard battery reset and charge procedure only to have the robot run for two minutes and die. After calling iRobot, the determination was that the battery had been sitting in inventory for too long. I paid the shipping to return the battery. iRobot shipped a battery to me for free."
5,"Ahh, what a voice:)","Dev Singh is a close family friend, a wonderful optomistic fun person, and a very talented performer.Heartscape is a very earthy and powerful album, Dev's voice brings new meaning to the word ""magnatude"", he sings from deep within himself and brings you along for the ride:)I highly recomend this album, not just as a friend but as an appreciator of fine music!"
2,Miserable technical work,"I was quite disappointed at the quality of this VHS print. It looked as though it were a copy of a copy! It is a pity that such a masterpiece should have such a third rate presentation. I have seen a much, much better showing on a TV channel. I will keep my eye on the AMC and make a copy for myself from the television presentation."
1,Good movie...Horrible film quality,"Why is it that at least 4 of Edward G. Robinson's high qualitymovies have been ""preserved,"" both in video and DVD, in horrid condition. Scarlet Street is probably the worst of the lot, but The Red House, Woman in the Window, and even The Stranger with Orson Welles are all available only in very bad condition. I would imagine there are many TV stations that own much better prints that could be used. Whether in the public domain or not, all of the above films except The Red House could be considered classics (Fritz Lang directing or original scripts and performances) and should have by now gotten a preservation treatment."
1,Unwatchable Transfer,"We stopped after fifteen minutes because the quality of the transfer (and perhaps the print from which it was taken) was so poor as to be unwatchable. Dark, smudged, occasionally pixallated images make Eddie Robinson and Joan Fontaine almost unrecognizable."
2,POOR SOUND QUALITY,Good movie but very annoying to sit and listen to(Poor sound Quality). Kino Video seems to have this problem in quite a few of their movies. I have over 250 1940's in my collection and rarely run into this problem.
4,Lang's second best American film.,"Scarlet Street twists and turns all over the place and is a superb story about evil cons and their unknowing dupe. It has a lot of poignancy about the self-imposed prison that people situate themselves in, how unscrupulous people can prey on the weak and insecure. It is a thoroughly pitch-black film noir about the depths of humanity.I have to knock of one star though for a couple of reasons. First, the film sacrifices a modicum of reality for yet another plot twist, and Robinson's gullibility is just a little too played out; it gets redundant. Dan Duryea is not particularly good in his role either; too affected. And the ending was a bit trite.For me, Fury is the best film Lang made in Hollywood, for the clarity of its incredibly harsh message and its riveting drama. Scarlet Street is a wicked little film but doesn't quite scale the same teutonic heights."
5,Film Noir Surprise,"I don't know if anyone else would agree, but this film seems like a precursor to David Lynch movies especially in the characterizations. It's an incredible film noir. Like Richard Widmark, Dan Duryea could play a weasel very effectively in one movie and then appear as equally effective in another as the good guy. Fritz Lang gives a very quirky edge to all the familiar character types appearing in this film. I saw a faded copy and was still blown away by it. I'm going to order the restored Kino print for my library dvd collection. Even if you don't care for film noir, but like old movies, please see this. Give it a chance to unfold and draw you into it. Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennet, Charles Kemper everyone is excellent."
1,Very Poor Copy,"This is a great film but this so-called remastered version is extremely poor. It's actually impossible to watch,the picture is blurred, full of artifacts and lines. There's a big white vertical line running though it. It looks like a copy of a copy of a VHS tape. Even the sound track is out of synch. with the actors. Horrible. Maybe I have a bad DVD, but I'm returning it and trying one from a different supplier because this a film worth having."
5,Classic movie undone by inferior print qualit y.,"Scarlet Street succeeds in spite of the extremely poor quality of the video transfer to DVD. First rate screenplay, acting and direction defer this reviewer's condemnation of the picture. I haven't seen the VHS of this film, so I don't know what the comparison is between the two. The film's quality reminds me of the VHS release of another classic, The Red House, sadly, again starring Edward G. Robinson. Not worth the low price."
3,Better Then Nothing,If you love this film as I do then don't be discouraged by the reveiws critical of the quality of the print and the transfer. It is no worse then the version shown on cable and not that bad in my opinion. Until Image or Kino picks it up and does a restoration this is better then no DVD at all.EDIT; Kino Video has remastered the film and done a fine job. You can find it on Amazon.[...]
5,"fabulous, in-depth, comprehensive and yet fun book!",I came to order La Capital as a gift as I found the book to be the single BEST book to help someone understand México's grand history. Too bad for my friend that the publisher hasn't reprinted this classic. It's a page-turner that keeps you locked in it's grip for days. Detailed and yet fun - what a book to be out of print! Get the message publisher?
4,A delightful read,"La Capital tells an absorbing story by following the twists and turns of the history of Mexico City. The writing style is clear yet the author also gives a comprehensive history of the Mexican capital. Of special note are the many anecdotes which provide much of the human interest for the reader. My favourite was the story of Irma Serrena ""La Tigresa"", a presidential mistress."
3,Not a Good Revision of a Classic Book,"The 1st edition by Adrian Melissinos is a classic reference book with a wealth of practical information and data. That book was published in 1966; yet much of the theoretical treatments and methods are still applicable today. This 2nd edition either deleted or replaced some important original material. The 2nd edition did not do a good job in discussing new developments since the publication of the last edition. For instance, in the discussion of the Fabry-Perot method for high resolution spectroscopy, there was no mention of using a piezoelectric actuator which is commonly used at present and a significant development since the publication of the 1st edition. Useful data in nuclear experiments were deleted. A chapter of useful techniques in the 1st edition that deals with useful procedures such as pulse height analysis and basic vacuum technique was deleted."
3,Closer to Vonnegut than Heinlein,"Light on character, heavy on philosophy and ideas, Godwin throws some big stones at evangelical Christianity without taking on any of the really tough questions. The plot revolves around energy beings from another galaxy who foster intelligent life on Earth... only to discover that humans are flawed (ala Brin's Uplift series). Superficial and cartoonish in places, clearly heartfelt and deeply moving in others, never as funny as Godwin seems to think, the story ultimately collapses on Godwin's inability to provide a character about whom the reader really cares. Hence reminiscent of the absurdities of Vonnegut."
5,Available again!,Great news! I found this book at Dreams Unlimited and it's now available again. Snake Oil Wars is being reissued also at www.dreams-unlimited.com next month and I can't wait to get a copy of that! These books are definite keepers!
4,Not Free SF Reader,"This pair of books is a satire, and it is fairly obvious of what type. A couple of really advanced aliens decide to monkey with life on earth. This leads to humanity developing rather quickly, but it turns out 'dem people are rather immature and like to hit things, kill people, and blow stuff up.This results in a lot of dead people stuff for the aliens to play with, becoming confused for the god guy and the devil guy. Fairly amusing.3.5 out of 5"
3,"A letdown compared with ""Dreams of My Russian Summers""","Unfortunately, I cannot report that Andrei Makine's ""Requiem for a Lost Empire"" is anything close to as good as his ""Dreams of My Russian Summers"". Read the book summary for the overall plot, but, basically the novel portrays the lives of three generations of the same family, as each generation literally has to escape for their lives--during the Russian Revolution, during World War II, and during the Cold War. The chases during the first two generations were gripping, but the narrative in second half of the novel just seemed to lose focus. I had a hard time putting the book together at the end.Even more of a let down, and it is hard to put this in words, was that this novel did not contain the unbelievably beautiful writing found throughout ""Dreams of My Russian Summers"". The book wasn't lengthy, though I wouldn't have reread it knowing what I do now."
1,Knives fall out,"This holds long shallow blades (like a serrated, bread knife) ok, but a standard 8 inch Western chef's knife, or a Japanese Santoku, flops over in the slot and falls out because the blade slots are too wide and too shallow. Obviously, knives falling out of the holder and banging around in the drawer is not the best solution.It looks nice, and I expect that it would last a long time, but since this item fails at the one thing it's intended to do, I can't rate it higher than one star."
4,The Life and Adventures of Santa Clause,I give all my grandchildren Christmas books each year. This was a wonderful choice for my teen-age grandsons who are more into the fantasy stories than traditional Christmas stories. I even got kind of caught up in it. The pictures are great especially for the teens who want to go into graphic arts.
4,Santa Claus is back in Town!,"In author L. Frank Baum's book, nymph Necile finds a tiny babe in the forest of Buzee and raises him along with the help of the great spirits, elves, nymphs, knooks and ryls under the wisdom and guidance of the great Ak (Leader of all the great Spirits). She names him Claus who later grows up asking what is his purpose in life, and then decides to make toys to deliver to all boys and girls on one special night out of the year. But as time passes he soon he discovers that he is growing old. . .A great book by L. Frank Baum that explores the fantastical life of Santa Claus-a real joy and gem to read, especially when you come to realize how many years ago this book was written. Baum's work here is so imaginative that many of today's stories of Santa Claus in my opinion pale in comparison."
2,ordinary video,It is just a ordinary video. It is not worthy to purchase for $2. It should be free. It is little long boring and poorly edited video.
3,Not quite a sailing thriller,I was mildly disappointed in this book. While I love the Sharpe series I thought that this would be an interesting spy thriller. A few times the main character didn't seem like the intelligence agent he was supposed to be. The plot was a little hard to believe at times. There wasn't much sailing.
4,Scoundrel by Bernard Cornwell,This is Cornwell at his best a good yarn a good plot what more can you ask for
5,Something different for Cornwell,"I bought this because I have enjoyed Cornwell's Sharpe series. However, seeing that it had been published in the early 90's, I didn't have great hopes for it. I assumed it was one of Cornwell's lesser efforts that hadn't gotten wide distribution.The story takes place during the Gulf War and concerns an American born (sometime) IRA member who is asked to transport gold to the US by boat so that the IRA can buy Stinger missles. However, there are some inconsistencies and seeming Arab connections that don't seem to fit into this story. The protagonist tries to figure out the true motives of all involved, plus he would like to double cross his employers and keep the gold.This story reminded me of one of Jack Higgins' better stories. The characters are fairly well drawn and the story is an exciting one. Sure, there are a couple of parts in the story that one may question, but this is not meant to be great art. It is a darn good yarn, however."
5,Great read,The story line kept me in suspence all the way through.I wonder how this man keeps on finding scenarios to write these most interesting slant on the problems of Northen Ireland. His understanding of sailing a yacht and all of the research requiredastound me
4,A different breed of cat,"I have read a dozen or more of Bernard Cornwell's books,but Scoundrel is totally different from the norm.Modern day setting with a nautical theme.Many plot twists."
3,Good but not first choice,"This was my first Arabic cookbook I bought while dating a Lebanese man. I found it very helpful and a great introduction into Arabic food. I have since married the Lebanese man and have now lived in the Middle East for 8 years and I still have my favorite recipes in this book. However, I have found From the Land of Figs and Olives (Habeeb Salloum & James P)eters) to have many more recipes I love to cook and serve proudly to our Lebanese friends. Another book that was great to understand the history of Lebanon/Syria and find some truely unique old-fashion foods is Recipes and Remembrances by Sonia Uvezian.I don't regret buying this book but I think it is my second choice as I reach for The Land of Figs & Olives much more for not only Lebanese recipes but for Moroccan and Iraqi receipes."
4,"Covers Broad Range of Areas, LOTS of Recipes","This is a good cookbook and one I feel comfortable using for years to come. It's much more complete and has many more recipes than I anticipated. I like that it is broken up by country, although this is slightly confusing for the countries whose cuisines I know little about.These are not recipes that you'll make quickly and for every night dinners (at least if you're like me, you won't), but it's an excellent resource for those more special dinners. It's a fun book to play around with when you want to do something different.My husband and I love the flavors of the Middle East this book provides. After living in Central Asia for a few years, I've been trying for the past two years to recreate some of their dishes based on vague recipes friends gave me. This cookbook spelled out the recipes for me and enabled me to make some things taste ""right"" for the first time in years.This is an excellent resource. It's well worth your money."
5,Must Have.,"I highly recommend this cook book. I liked the diversity, the accuracy and the thought of representing recipes of each Country. In some of the recipes Mrs. Mallos had the same dishes prepared diff. and I thought that was interesting.Grear Dishes.Worth the money.I would liked to have seen more of the Jordanian and Palestinian dishes...but I cant complain."
5,MIDDLE EASTEN LIKE MUM USED TO MAKE,"Tess Mallos has writtern a cookbook wich inspires people to try a new dish with true confidence Her recepies are true to taste,just as mum would cook at home. It is rare to find such a dedicated author in staying as true to the recepie as she does. I would like to congratulate her on a great and interesting book to read and experiment in making mouthwatering dishes from the Middle East."
4,Great book !,This is a fantastic cookbook with great recipes and beautiful pictures. I would recommend to all.
4,Middle East Cookbook,"Recently bought this cookbook and love the variety of ethnic dishes. Made my first afghan dish and it was, from what I was told, authentic and delicious."
2,I guess Israel isn't in the middle east,"I was hoping for the focus to be on food, not on politics. I'd return it but I bought it used. Get one of the other books listed."
5,Loved it!!,"I purchased this novel based on other Amazon reviews and I just loved it!! It's clever, engaging, and definitely a page turner. Get it!"
5,Great book for lovers of classics,"Wilkie Collins was the first, I believe, to write what we now know as the classic mystery. His wonderful novel, ""The Moonstone"" introduces many of those elements we have come to expect in a good mystery such as the clever detective who sees clues that no one else does, characters with dark secrets, and exotic bloodthirsty villains.It is deservedly a classic and needs to be read in that light. The characters and setting are from another epoch with no trace of the revolting moral decay found in many modern-day mysteries. Persons who prefer blood, gore and vulgarity on a monstrous scale can look to mystery writers such as Elizabeth George. For those who appreciate Dickens and Austen, I believe they will be pleasantly surprised to read this gem."
2,None,"My goodness, what a longwinded book! I love reading but this one was very boring. I only finished it to see what happened to the diamond."
3,The Moonstone,Tawdry. The story conjurred up those old nightmares of the required reading books way back in high school. I'm sure Mr. Collins wrote something outstanding but I have not found it yet. For now I'll stick to Mark Twain who is at least entertaining.
2,"Go ahead and yawn, you won't miss anything.","I understood that The Moonstone is a classic so I decided to read this to be culturally literate. Well the story line may be interesting but the writing is atrocious. It is curricular, bloated, and seemingly pointless. The characters just keep rattling. A lot of writers fill in the story with descriptions of time and place to give an atmosphere to the story. This writer (Wilkie Collins) just fills it with unrelated trivia. Every once in a while I would go back a few pages to see what I must have missed. When I read again there was nothing there to miss. Ether Wilkie is extremely monotonous or other writing from this period is and I am just now lucky enough to find out. I talked to others about this and they said; ""Now you know why Sherlock Holmes is so popular"""
4,Collins; not T.S. Elliot,"Some people seem determined to prove T.S. Elliot wrong. That's not the point here. The Moonstone is a well written book which continues to be a good early example of the detective novel. Poe did it better; but Collins was on the right path.Yes, A.C. Doyle borrowed ideas from W. Collins. He borrowed even more from E.A. Poe. Doyle actively denied getting ideas from Poe on several occasions, but the proff is in his writings."
5,Wonderful,"The character development in this book is amazing, you almost feel you could pick them out of a line up! It is definitely a well written and enjoyable old mystery and well worth reading."
5,Wilkie Collins is a Genius,Fun story and my book club had fun reading and discussing it. The plot and characters are so fun. I'm surprised how many people aren't familiar with one of the first detective novels ever written!
2,I received the wrong edition,"Thank You, but I received the wrong edition. I needed Penguine series book for child school reading. I don't know what to do! To Send it back, or talk to a teacher."
4,Good old-fashioned mystery writing,"My sister had this book when we were kids and I never got around to reading it. She had recommended it, so when I saw it in the Kindle version I decided to have a go. I'm glad I did."
1,The Moonstone,"In reading over 70 mystery novels on Kindle , I find this document the most boring of the entire lot.Sorry!!!!"
1,"Go ahead and yawn, you won't miss anything","I understood that The Moonstone is a classic so I decided to read this to be culturally literate.

2,Moonstone disappointment,Not sure about this one. Really enjoyed the Woman in White.I found this one a little tedious and slow quite despite thevery high esteem in which it is held by Wilkie fans.
4,Not Quite First; But Great,The Moonstone is not the first ever detective novel. That was penned by Edgar Allan Poe. It set the formulas all others have followed ever since. Collins follows in The Mater's footsteps with skill. The Moonstone is well worth reading.
1,Warning: Kindle edition notes don't work,"I bought this edition instead of downloading one of the free ones because Oxford World Classics has copious notes. Unfortunately, they don't work in this book, i.e. when you place the cursor on one it doesn't recognize it as a note. Notes in the other OWC Kindle book I own work just fine but not here. I have requested a refund and will buy the book again when Kindle or Oxford tells me it's fixed."
1,the worst book in the world,"I had to read this for an English class and found it to be the most boring thing I have ever written. The author babbles endlessly about inane subjects; the plot is boring and the ending disapointing. The entertainment value is non existent and there is nothing in this so called ""classic"" even remotely interesting. I beg of you, spare yourself and get another book."
5,Edge of your seat suspense,"This was one of the best books I have ever read. Collins is a master of creating, building, and holding suspense. Where most detective novels end abruptly, with a short synopsis of what happened by the detective, The Moonstone unravels slowly and intriguingly as question upon question arises in the mind of the reader. A must-read."
5,The Moonstone,"The Moonstone is a classic, and although is a great mystery, the writing is most creative. The story is told as though one of the characters decided to write about the events over the past year. To help him, he asks other characters to take up a chapter from their own point of view. Therefore the story is ""written"" by several authors - all characters in the story. Because of the various writers, the style of writing changes to reflect the characters' personalities. This is a very creative method of defining each character and gives a better perspective of the events of the mystery."
5,A Favorite Many Times Over,This is a book worth reading many times. I pick it up every couple of years and enjoy it more and more every time. Collins mocks and sympathizes with his characters at the same time. The mystery is fun. The plot is a bit slow. The characters make the book well worth the time. They are like old friends with all of the forgivable faults and quirks that mark the best of friends.
2,The Moonstone- old writing,"I was not able to get into this book at all- I found the writing old fashioned and it often required a translation in my head to figure out what was said. It starts out with a nice mystery but then twists into something even Sherlock Holmes couldn't figure out because of details left out that no one could have guessed the twists and turns of the book. I value it because it is one of the first dective books written that spawned many more writings, writings that were better in my opinon."
2,don't bother,I read the first few chapters and didn't care for this book at all. The wording was not something I cared for. I took a chance for $.99!
5,fabulous,"I have to say that I'm not usually one for detective stories. I didn't know this was one, I just bought it because it was in English and it was cheap. I wasn't able to detect whodunnit. Usually it becomes fairly obvious. I did suspect the criminal, as I suspected everyone else in turn. And it was so superbly written, I had it read in one night. You don't have to be a fan of detective novels to read this. I highly recommend it and I hope to find some more of Collins' works in Germany. Otherwise I will buy some when I go home at Christmas"
1,Get the Oxford edition,"My review is about the Penguin edition, not the novel, which is fantastic. In order to save space, Penguin editions are printed with type size so tiny that it is unnecessarily difficult to read to read the novels. I recently discovered this fact to my chagrin when I began reading my copy of the Penguin Moonstone this morning. I ordered it not realizing there was an Oxford edition that is 50 pages longer. The Oxford editions are priced just as inexpensively as are the Penguins but have far more pages and a normal, very readable type size.The Moonstone (Oxford World's Classics)I will now order the Oxford edition of The Moonstone; ditto for the Oxford edition of any other work of literature in future. (Just checked and see that the Oxford edition of Trollope's The Way We Live Now, which I just read, is about 200 pages longer than the Penguin edition.)"
3,Interesting book,"Apparently this is the first detective novel in the English language. This is a free edition.Easy to read, not as much action as I expected from the wild plot premise -- a cursed Indian diamond.Mostly it is of historical interest -- I did not find it gripping, and the humorous writing style is a little dated, but the prose is quite acceptable.A worthy addition to one's Kindle library, though not something I would read over and over again."
4,The First and Only Detective Novel,"I am not usually a big fan of detective novels. I find that the Sherlock Holmes stories, while entertaining, do not give the reader enough of a hint as to what is going on. The Moonstone on the other hand, on which the Sherlock Holmes stories are based, is entertaining to the end, and the reader is let in on what is happening most of the time. When this is not the case, the mystery just gets better. Towards the middle the book does get slow, but that is made up for by the excelent beginning and finish. The language also tends to get a bit tedious, but the captivating storyline makes up for it all. It is a smart, and at times very funny detective novel that I am very happy to have read"
3,Lost me at the end,"I enjoyed this book for about the first two-thirds and then it became remarkably tedious. For the last third I really just wanted it to be over. Some of the characters are fantastic and funny and interesting and some are just plain dull. I think ""The Woman in White"" is a much better book and would recommend it over this long-winded mystery."
2,Rather laborious to get through,"I had a hard time getting through this. In fact, I couldn't finish it. I can't say there was anything specifically wrong with the book, it just didn't appeal to me."
4,"Long, but I stuck with it.","This story is so old and I found it very dated. But, if you keep in mind when it was written, it had some interesting twists."
3,A minor let-down...,"After a stunning debut, a stellar follow-up, and a bold and tasty EP, we get interference... ""Penetration Point"" was rife with internal conflict, lack of focus, and lack of cohesiveness. Lost was the nastiness and savage rendering of the material, songs about wrestling, moving into a new neighborhood, and the drummer's family just don't stack up to ""Dungeon of Pleasure"" and ""Incursion Dimentia"". By this time Savage was a band just trying to hang in there. They didn't make it much past Penetration Point, as the frequent line-up shifts and inner-band problems were too much of a distraction for them to continue to focus on being Nasty Savage. Once Ronnie dropped the blood and guts and adopted the WWF gimmick, they had lost their core audience, and subsequently, lost their way! Truly a band to be missed!"
1,Got PHD?,Unless you have:1. C++ adv2. combinatorics math3. calc math4. discrete / finite math5. basic overview of topics in data structures.you have to be a phd in this subject to understand this bookand weiss's book. this is better than weiss's book in regards to laungaugebut I have decided to buy DSA in 24 hours by Lofore his name? great bookto get me to the level of these books like Weiss..
2,Thumbs down,Readable code?! Most of it is inline and comments are sparse. Don't buy it if you're looking for clear examples to build from in C++.
4,Another great performance from Dumas and his Musketeers,"The Vicomte De Bragelonne is another masterpiece by Dumas. Although not as captivating as the first two books in his series (The Three Musketerrs and Twenty Years After), VDB certainly has its moments. VDB is followed by Louise de la Valliere and finally the series ends with the story of the Man in the Iron Mask. This book starts of rather slowly compared to the others and certainly is not as captivating albeit it is a good read. The ending is a little weak too. The middle is simply a page turner. Adventure after adventure. This book sets up the plot for the last two in the series (all three were really one book entitled Ten Years Later). The Musketeers (d'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis) could not be more different in this book. They are taking diffent sides of the governmental rift as Louis XIV finally makes his rise to power. I recommend this book. END"
1,BUYER BEWARE -- THIS BOOK IS NOT IN ENGLISH,"I ordered this book for my husband for Christmas after carefully reading and double checking the product details, which clearly showed the language as ENGLISH. When the book arrived it had no shipping or account statement enclosed. The book is written in FRENCH."
1,"Beware, this is a FRENCH language version, NOT ENGLISH!","What a disappointment! I am deep into this series and out of the country. Imagine my suprise and dismay to find that this version is written entirely in French. Now I must wait five weeks to order an English language version. That being said, it only cost 99 cents. I guess you really do get what you pay for."
5,Braying All the Way!,"I had the joy of writing the foreword for this book and can say with all my heart, ""You gotta read this one!"" As a woman who never learns anything the easy way, I very much identified with the various scenarios Virelle Kidder describes in Donkeys Still Talk. How often have I whined about problems, challenges, and difficult people, when they were God-sent ""donkeys"" meant to get my attention?! This book offers the two things we can never get enough of in this world--truth and hope--penned by a writer who has plenty of both to share."
3,Some good insight,"Although this book is no literary masterpiece, it offers some good insight as to how character is built into our lives by difficult circumstances and people. It's easy reading and ""folksy"" in its approach. A good light read, but nothing earth shattering."
2,"Good philosophy content, but the author is biased","Although this book has much good information about the origins and reasons that philosophy came about, the author chose to use this college textbook as a springboard for his bias towards some of the great philosophers. Yes, maybe in today's society some of the views of the great philosophers may not be PC. This book is not the place to express your own views."
4,Beautiful,"I'm only 17 but do to the recent activities in Yugoslavia, I've been thrown into its path. Arsenijevic is a writer who beautifully entwines comedy and tragedy. You are often laughing and crying because of the ambivalence. If you have been paying attention to the horrors going on in Kosovo right now, you somehow can understand, through reading, how those people fighting to remain normal feel right now. A must read. You'll never put it down."
4,Good trailer lug nuts - but wish they came 12 to a pack instead of 10,"Replaced all 24 worn out two piece lug nuts on my Airstream trailer with these. Seem to be high quality and a big improvement. Reason they get four stars instead of five is I needed 24 of them (four wheels times six nuts per wheel) - they should package these as 12 per box instead of 10, or make a box of four or five available. My guess they are trying to encourage you to buy a pack of four locking lug nuts, which costs more than a 10 pack of these and I really didn't need for the stock wheels on the Airstream..."
1,good strategy - bad tactics,"The one star is for the good idea of reissuingrare and hard to find books.Unfortunately, the result here is a minor disaster.The print is unbelievably small and looks ridiculousbordered by acres of unused margin space.Perhaps more disappointing, though, are the low qualityreproductions - the few that are offered, anyway.Apparently, they just did not care enough about thisproject to do even a halfway decent job. Too bad."
2,"not as bad, but ain't that good either.........","this was a disappointment. i thought their debut was one of the best albums in a long time. i was soooooooo looking forward to this one to see if the absence of nikki would be a difference maker. it was.... but not in a good way. things sound lost in the mix, the writing ain't to great, and london is all over the place. traci plays pretty good, and scott's drumming is great. but there just ain't enough hair on them balls like the last album. it's a shame corabi left before the band 1st album came out, and it's a shame ginger left the band before the second album came out. both of them could have helped the band overcome the absence of sixx. maybe next time london le grand won't be such a prima donna, and get help sharing the spot light."
2,"Not terrible, just boring.","Tracii Guns is a good musician but he has not written good material since Vicious Circle during his time in LA Guns. The songs on this album don't seem to have any real thought behind them. Tracii can play and London can sing but this band needs Nikki Sixx back because he can write. There are no hooks to be found.Also, the production on this cd is bad. It sounds like an average garage band rented time in a local small town studio. Save your money and buy 'Here Come The Brides'."
4,classic A-HA,"i mistook this for their previously released ""HEADLINES AND DEADLINES-the best of a-ha"". the singles lp is more or less like the album earlier mentioned. i just wished that this time, they had included the song ""october"" from their scoundrel days lp. it's one very good song and so hard to find now. will somebody out there share me a copy of a-has' OCTOBER pleeeeeeeease....."
5,A-Ha is amazing,"It's a shame that A-ha is known as ""one hit wonder"" here in America, but I have to say that they are one of the best bands ever... I went to many music stores to buy their CDs, but none seemed to carry their recent albums. However, thanks to Amazon.com, I was able to buy some of their recent albums. If you want to know what they sound like these days, this album is perfect one for you."
3,"Great band, but songs are all redone","I guess I need to learn how to burn my own greatest hits CD, because I had no idea that hardly any of these songs are the versions from the original albums. In fact, many of the songs on this CD are cut shorter. I guess people don't realize the difference, because everyone seems to give such high ratings. I think that The Living Daylights is a HOT song, but this version, which was in the movie, sucks compared to the version that's on their Stay On These Roads CD. I can't imagine why they couldn't use THAT version in the movie, and why they couldn't put the same version in this CD. When I buy a ""greatest hits"" CD, I usually get the original recordings, and if they're different versions, it is mentioned on the cover. I don't know if Headlines and Deadlines is the same, but I heard it is."
5,Comprehensive but compelling,"For a native of the flood-prone Sacramento Valley, Battling The Inland Sea is the bible. Nowhere else is the history of a fitful battle against the annual floodwaters unleashed on the Sacramento Valley by the powerful Sierra Nevada watersheds captured so comprehensively. Kelley, however, informs us in a style that is relevant and entertaining. The valley resident treasures it for its history of the Big Fight. Political scientists enjoy it for its history and the lively way Kelley uses the fight over flooding in Northern California as a study in California and national politics."
2,"Essentially the same book as ""Gold v. Grain""","I am a big California rivers environmental history buff, and I found this book to be too similar to his publication ""Gold v. Grain"" which debuted over 40 years ago. This book is essentially an extension of ""Gold v. Grain"" that covers the 1960s-1980s. Much of the earlier chapters are virtually cut and pasted verbatim from his previous book. Despite these criticisms, it remains (to my knowledge) the most comprehensive book written about the Sacramento River to date. Until a better book on the Sac comes along, this is probably the one to read for factual information, and for more conceptual/abstract stimulation, I recommend ""Organic Machine"" by Richard White."
3,quite good,"Not excellent, I like Medtner very much but these are not his best works, for surebla bla bla bla bla blaMartin"
3,wagner Ex673 Brake pad set,"i always use Wagner products for my car. not a bad product, but got around 35000KM. I used a similar Wagner product (QC673) before and able get close to 50000km. still very quiet and smooth braking."
2,Stay away there are much better books,"I debated whether or not to give this book one or two stars. I guess I'm just a nice guy.This book is full of errors and has examples that are way too long to prove their point. It spends most of it's time demonstrating slick little features of VC++ 2005 express and not enough time teaching basics of programming. It's the type of book that DeVry or the University of Phoenix would pick for one of their classes to con you into thinking you're learning programming. I've gone to both, I know what I'm talking about.Also, vc++ 2005 express has a few bugs and lousy debugging. I could go into more detail about what's wrong with the book but the editors at Course should've done their job and I'm not going to do it for them.Even the quote from a reviewer for the Dr. Dobb's Journal on the front cover is deceptive. It praises the book series and not the book itself. That should've been a red flag for me but I wasn't paying attention.This book is a waist of time."
4,Good book for begginers !!!!,I would recommend the book for begginners and people interested to learn from zero how to program in Visual C++. It should be the first programming language book to someone starting to study Visaul C++
1,Dont even think about it,Iam going to refrain from using certain words but this is the worse book i have every read. This is not for beginners. Doesn't really explain anything clearly. It just tells you to input the code and some of it doesn't even work. get another book
2,Not what I was expecting...,"This book deals more with using MVC++E 2005 Express and not the basics of programing in MVC++E. For learning how to use MVC++E this is the book, learning how to produce good C++ code it is not. Example, knowing how to and when to use Union's, Struct's and class's is a plus, I currently don't see this from this book."
1,"In my opinion, it is a VERY bad book!","I think this book is very badly organised, AND IT LACKS MOST OF THE BASICS ON HOW TO WRITE YOUR FIRST VISUAL C++ PROGRAM! THE AUTHORS SHOULD TAKE LESSONS FROM GREG PERRY'S ""AN ABSOLUTE BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO C"" WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF HOW TO TEACH ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS!I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND BUYING THIS BOOK, UNLESS YOU REALY WANT, BUY BUYING THIS BOOK, TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHORS TO DO BETTER IN THE FUTURE.What's worse, it actually LACKS the basics to get you started. I think that, to an absolute beginner, this book is not a good textbook at all ! If you buy and try to read this book, you will probably hate programming for the rest of your life!Very, very, very bad book in my opinion."
1,typing Pal,I dont hate Garfields Typing Pal. I have had it before and really liked it I just do not have it now. I want to get it to practise my typing.
1,No serial #,"No serial number. That is awful. And no customer support. Thanks to the other customers who supplied me with a working serial #, but Amazon should not be selling this. The number I used was RTR5MB9NE7TFQRYZ."
1,Garfield Typing Pal Deluxe,I ordered..this..you go to install it..asks for serial number on the box...no serial number on t he box...called 800 number..given a recording for the serial number..w.rong serial number...called back again...The recording is in French.
2,loud and disk dependent,The disk spins making a loud sound and the software does not load to my harddrive. I am dissapointed in the product. Product code was not available on my disk so I used the posted registation number. It appears to me that there is little interest from the company in their product.
3,MISSING SERIAL NUMBER AGAIN!,"I bought this for my 12-year old son who has to learn the keyboard because he now will use a laptop in school. Thanks to the Amazon customer that provided the serial number RTR5MB9NE7TFQRYZ. I was getting ready to return this product after calling the 800 number on the box and hearing a very long message in French. Merci to the Amazon reviewer, no Merci to the manufacturer ""DeMarque"" I hope using the software is better than the install."
4,Serial Number: second CONFIRM. It isn't there!,"I purchased the program based on the other good reviews, knowing ahead of time that there was an issue with the serial number. I received the product with NO SERIAL NUMBER ANYWHERE. I searched high and low on the box it arrived in, on the jewel case (which had no paper on/in it), and the CD itself. I tried the serial number that the previous reviewer used and it worked. That number is: RTR5MB9NE7TFQRYZ. I have tried the program briefly for myself and it is fun. My son couldn't wait to give it a try. In fact, he didn't want to stop when I told him his time was up. The program is entertaining, but also educational."
4,Excellent Typing Tutor for children,"My daughter is 10 years old and uses the program daily for 1/2 hour a day. Although she considers it a chore, once she gets started she gets into it. I would recommend this program to other young children who want to learn to touch-type."
1,Garfield's Typing Pal is STUPID!! Do not buy it!!,"I totally agree with Mr. Goldman. The program came with no serial number or key. In the installation it asks for the serial on the ""CD-Rom box"". The only identification I found on the box was the barcode on the bottom of the box(which does not work). This is the second copy of the game I bought because I lost the box. I am very disapointed with the producers who released this game without a serial number."
3,"Thanks, reviewers","Haven't used this program yet, though I have successfully installed it thanks to you reviewers who provided the code. My jewel case came from Amazon in a sealed package with nothing on it at all--no stickers, no writing. It would have been a real hassle had I not known what to do because of all you previous writers.Thanks again!"
4,Give it a chance,"Admitly I wanted to fling this book against the wall more than once as I began reading it - the first 100-150 pages are less than typical SEP writing. It was one of her earlier books so she had not crafted her writing style as we know it in today's books; however, once you get past the first 100 pages of ""Old World"" fluff - they could be cut down to 10 pages and had more effect - the book takes off! When it does, fasten your seat belt and hang on. It's SEP at her finest! The last couple of chapters - not to mention the epoulge - more than makes up for the first 100 or so pages! I would give it a 5 star rating but in all fairness I had to deduct 1/2 a star for the 100 or so pages in the beginning. All in all, well worth the read."
4,Fancy Pants,"SEP again writes of human transformation, this time in the form of a spoiled European beauty and the rough-around-the-edges golfer who challenges her beliefs. Although the characters didn't quite hit home the way other of her characters have, SEP's writing shines throughout. Engaging."
3,Good but not great book!,I haven't read many of Susan's books but I enjoyed most of the ones I have and would enjoy them more if her characters were more moralistic and not so free with their favors. I loved how this book portrayed the heroine with much backbone after realising her potential. I loved the plot (spoiled to independent).
2,So disapointed...,"I had read 2 books by Susan that I loved (Match me If You can , and It Had to be You) and was really looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it is very disappointing. The story goes back and forth, and not in a very clear way. The plot has some holes and I kept jumping whole pages, which is always very frustrating to me. I thought I wasn't going to finish it. The beginning of the book- actually the first half- takes forever. The book starts to come together on the second half but by then I was bored to death. Sorry about this one but I can not recomend it."
3,A Different Taste From SEP,"I decided to buy Fancy Pants because the character, Dallie and Francie, appeared on her book ""Lady Be Good"". I enjoyed all of SEP's books I owned and so I wanted to try this one also. This one was rather different than those I had. It had lots of flashbacks, very complicated characters, and of course the taste of the 80's. I can't say that this was one of her best, but I don't think it was a disappointment for me also. I did managed to finish it :0). But if you don't consider yourself a truly SEP fan, I think you should try her newer books, like Dream a Little Dream or It Had to be You. If you are SEP big fans like me, I think you should give this book a try to taste some different experience."
4,"I expected to hate it, but I didn't!","Based upon the reviews I read here, I thought I'd hate this book, but I really didn't. I didn't misunderstand any of it, and though I could have done without Francie's mother's lineage, it still wasn't as bad as Glitter Baby, which is the only book I've ever had to discard without finishing."
2,A bit of a disappointment...,"After having read 'This Heart of Mine' by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, I decided to read Fancy Pants next. I was disappointed. The book is very dated in the 80's. I lived through shoulder pads as fashion once already! The characters are rather easy to dislike. By the end I could have cared less if they got together or fell off a cliff. If you are trying to decide on buying a book, choose something else of Susan Elizabeth Phillips."
1,Her Worst,"Hated the characters, especially our hero(?). In real life he and his friend would have spent many years in prison for kidnapping. All SEP's other books are great."
1,Not memorable,"If you really have nothing better to do and can borrow this book from the library, read it. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
3,Okay,"I loved all the books in the Chicago Stars/Bonner family series so I thought I would feel the same about this one. While a bit drawn out, I did like Francesca's transformation from spoiled brat to a woman supporting her child on her own. I had a particular fondness for parts of this book that took place in Lake Charles because it's near where I was born and where my own parents grew up."
3,Almost didn't finish,The story starts out too slow and takes up too much of a time frame. (10 years) It is dated and I had to use my imaginiation to picture different clothing than described. Though all in all I liked the story and the ending it took too long to get there and I thought about not finishing it several times. Not her best book.
3,Not For Me,"I might've liked this book more if I'd read it when it was first published, but I didn't pick it up until long after I'd become a fan of Susan Elizabeth Phillips and she'd had time to cement her writing skills and character development talent. Fancy Pants is worth the read, if only to get to know some characters who appear in her most recent book, but I'd never recommend it to anyone who's never read Susan Elizabeth Phillips before."
2,Not her best..,"I've read about 6 of SEP's books and this was my least favorite. I liked the main characters, but only in the last 100 pages. It took a long time to get to Francie and Dallie's character development and I felt like SEP fast forwarded through the best parts of the story and lingered on the worst. I'm glad I read this book but don't start with this one! SEP is a great writer, very funny and imaginative. It didn't shine through in this work as it has in others."
2,"Warning - a very ""80's"" book...","Everyone knows SEP is a good writer, able to come up with interesting characters from wildly disparate backgrounds who somehow get together, but this book is not one of her greats. First off, it suffers what I consider an ""80's disease"" - a Sidney Sheldon/Judith Krentz - like obsession with designer names, foreign princes, descriptions of yachts, and lots of pre-AIDS catting around. Secondly, its characters are not all that endearing: our heroine is obsessed with looks, money, and success, and our hero is obsessed with bimbos and failure. He neglects to tell her he's married; she neglects to tell him she had his son. I had a hard time liking these people, wondering if it was worth the effort to sort through several relationships and lots of confusing flashbacks. I don't feel I'm giving away too much here--if you like SEP, you'll struggle through it anyway--I just wish someone had warned me what I was in for."
5,"Not your normal romance, but still delivers the goods","Huge SEP fan here. I found Fancy Pants to be out of the norm of the regular ""boy meets girl"" romance formula, but loved it anyway. I liked the fact that both Francesca and Dallie were not very likeable characters in the beginning, and though most characters grow and change, no two characters needed to more than these two. I liked that details of their lives (like Danny's death) popped up throughout the story, surprising us. The only thing that seemed a bit ""much"" was the large amount of time spent on some secondary characters (did Naomi, Chloe, Black Jack and Miranda need so much time in the story?) I did almost wish Francesca had bumped into Nicky, or someone from her old life at the end so they could have seen how much she had changed.In any case, this was a bit different, but the payoff at the end was great (as usual)."
4,"A little dated, but enjoyable read","I think this the only SEP romance that I hadn't read before. It's one of her first books and is longer and more detailed than some of her more recent works. It's a riches to rags back to riches story. The heroine, Francesca, is spoiled and annoying in the first part of the book. Several awful things happen to her, but instead of giving up, she rises to the challenge and really grows in character. The hero is Dallie, a laid-back golfer who has a strange relationship with his best friend/ex-wife. As always, the secondary characters are well developed and likable. This is the first story where we meet Teddy, the hero in the book she's writing now. The story is dated (similar to Glitter Baby), but I really enjoyed it. It is a good book to read or re-read in preparation for her new book which may be out in 2010."
5,The best i have read in a long time,"This book is was my fist sep. I loved it, it was so heart renching,the issues in the book were issues that i identified with. I totally love s.e.P now and i want to read all her books.i recomend this book to anyone who loves s.e.p and romance novels."
1,horrible electronic edition,"I've read this before in paperback, and with SEP's new book,Call Me Irresistible: A Novelwhich is the story of the son of the main characters from this book, coming out I thought I'd go back and read this book again. What an absolutely HORRIBLE electronic edition. It's VERY obvious that the publishers ran an old paper copy of this book through an OCR scanner and couldn't even be bothered to proofread it. I've seen fan fiction written by 6th graders with fewer typos. There were numerous typos on EVERY FREAKING page! Unless you're dying to read it somewhere where there's no bookstore available, do yourself a favor and buy the paperback. Whatever happened to having pride in your work? If I were the publishers or SEP, I would be incredibly embarrassed by this edition."
2,"Unlikeable ""heroine""","The protagonist does not have enough redeeming qualities. She is a one-dimensional, unlikeable character. She is rich, selfish, and beautiful--that's about it. Seeing her punished for being that way was not enough to keep me reading. The hero is more complex, and his job as a golf pro is an original one for a romantic hero. Some minor characters add interest, but not enough. This novel is not funny or entertaining."
2,Nearly put this down,"The background story was too long and a tad too boring for this book. I nearly put it down after reading the first 100 or so pages and they haven't met each other yet. If I didn't peak at the ending of the book, I wouldn't have finished this book at all. The relationship of the couple is a little hard to understand, mainly because it seems that they're not together a lot. I think SEP could have done much better w/ this book, considering her writing skills in the other books."
3,not SEP's best,"SEP's books normally are winners to me but unfortunately not this one. I agree with a previous reviewer who wrote that this book has too much back information. While I understand the need for an author to fill in her readers with some background info about the main characters, SEP certainly went overboard with this book. I kept skipping pages & pages of useless (to me) information about Francesca's grandmother, mother, etc.. and remember thinking ""Just get to the point & give me more of Dallie and Francesca already..!""But then again, that's ok.. since this was written quite a long time ago, and by comparing this book with her more recent ones I can see the amazing growth SEP has gone through as an author.If you're a first time SEP reader, I would suggest you pick up her more recent ones: Match Me If You Can, Ain't She Sweet, etc."
3,Not her best - just too long!,"Having come to this book after reading ""IT had to Be You"" and most other SEP books I have to say I was disappointed with this work. The first half -establishing the background of the main character -was way too long. The most interesting part of the story was the character transformation of the heroine but this was lost amongst all the other sub-plots!! Still love Ms Phillips' work but Dream A Little Dream and Heaven Texas are much better than this."
1,Disappointed,"After devouring all of SEP's other books, I had this one on order for over a month. I finally received it, settled down and was thoroughly disappointed. Icouldn't get into it, it was very slow moving, the story unbelievable and the cat fight where everyone stood around watching was uncalled for. I was really disappointed. Sorry."
1,Slow starter and hard to get into characters,"This is the third Susan Elizabeth Phillips' books I've read. This was not the usual ""stay up all night and read"" kind of book. I found it slow getting into and hard to get interested in the characters. The book was complicated as far as characters go...Francie and her European ties/Dallie with ties to golfing and Holly Grace having been married to Dallie at one time and now Francie's best friend. It captured my interest midway in the book; however, after that I really thought it was good. If you are a devoted Susan Elizabeth Phillips fan, this is not her typical book. Her other works are great. This book is mediocre in my eyes."
1,Fancy Pants,"Don't buy this book! It was sooooo boring and I couldn't get into it. A real let down after SEP's other books - try First Lady, Nobody's Baby But Mine or Dream A Little Dream instead. At least they have some zap and keep you interested...Fancy Pants on the other hand sent me to sleep zzzzzzzzzz! SORRY!"
1,Don't waste your time or your money,"The novel was interesting enough to find out what the over-the-edge characters would do next. However, the women, except Desiree, were mean, stupid, and/or unrealistic. We all know women that exhibit negative traits, but that's because no one is perfect. What's more, no one seemed able have a decent relationship with a Black man (unless the Black man was with a White woman). Instead the only positive relationships were made up of interracial couples. In fact the only Black male relationship explored was with a Black gay male who was involved with a man of mixed heritage. Not even he could have a relationship with an African American person, male or female. In my opinion, the author has major issues with Black women, and she may be a little color struck as well."
1,SUPREME DISAPPOINTMENT,"I am guilty of judging a book by it's cover. How I regret going that. This book was one of the most disappointing I have ever read. I realize Delorys Welch-Tyson is new to creating literature. However, I never imagined being quite so disappointed upon completing this book. Most of her characters remained underdeveloped. The book should have simply focused on the two main characters, Althea and Desiree. There was not enough dialogue and Althea was portrayed as an unbelievably immature 40ish year old woman. I wish Ms. Welch-Tyson better luck on her next novel. Maybe that novel will be more than just an attractive cover."
5,"Good book, with a different perspective on black women","Unlike many books about black women this book doesnt suggest their main problem is black men. Rather it suggests black women should take ownership of their own happiness and be responsible about achieving this. Although the issue of dating across racial lines is promiently featured in this book, that isn't what this book is about. Rather it suggests the beauty of black women can be enhanced with a letting go of anger about men and a commitment to one's own happiness.I did not see the dialouge as sterotypical I think many people, in a mass culture speak in generalities, but underneath the surface the real issues become apparent, as we get to know each other. As I got futher into the book I found many comments that were similar to those I often hear from women, I've known. A good read, a different perspective, I strongly recommend this book."
1,Why Me!,"I tried several times to complete this book and I found it a waste of time, I wouldn't suggest this book. Snap one!, Snap two!, Snap this book in two!"
1,Belongs on Jerry Springer!,"This book is just plain tacky. I have never seen so many women so colorstruck before! Black women are not like this! We are not this insecure! The book had an interesting plot, but some of the chapters portrayed Black women as evil, petty and immature. The cover of the book really attracts your attention because it has you thinking that this book is about intelligent divas, but it's really about a bunch of psychos!"
1,Three thumbs down!,"This book was recommended to me by one of my girlfriends. I'm glad that I bought it in paperback because I would have been mad if I bought it in hardcover( a waste of money).They were to many characters D.W.T. tried to elaborate on; the book should have been written about Aletha & Desiree because they were the main characters. I would have liked if the author wrote more about Veronica. Her story line was good but there was not enough information. Since this her first novel, I give her an A for effort. I hope her second novel will be worth reading & buying."
1,Don't waste your cash or your time!!!,"I was terribly disappointed in this book. The author's portrayal of black men was typical, while white men were shown as kind, understanding, etc., etc., etc. And who was she trying to convince that Jewish people are not white? The objective of this book seemed to be to push Black women in the arms of any man who isn't Black. Shame on you!!!"
4,An interesting New York Story of Powerfreak Sistahs!,"I just finished reading Gingersnaps after reading Welch-Tyson's second novel, Ladyfingers. I really enjoyed the humor in both stories, and found Gingersnaps in particular to be extremely thought provoking and glamorous. My favorite character was Aletha Brown and I felt disappointed that Aletha was not in the sequel. Please bring back Aletha Brown. Let us know what happened with her and her Japanese boyfriend!!!"
2,hunh????????,"I am an avid reader, often buying books I feel will be worth it in hardback..Well this book was definitely not worth it. I finished it because whenever I read I feel the need to know what happened to the characters, I guess I get involved with their lives. Well Miss Welch did give me that satisfaction but it seems that in the end she said ""oh my it's too long"", and therefore skipped to the ending without popular develpment. Oh well I guess next time her book will have to be a paperback!!!"
1,JUMBLED,"I heard how great this book was. A friend passed it on to me. How happy I am I DID NOT spent the money on it. Snap One, Snap Two etc, reminds me of going to the bakery, buying a box cookies, but only to discover they were all broken and different flavors. It is obvious the writer believes she is the next great female author, as the she flung BIG words throughout the book. Is she REALLY trying to write a book or vent about HER life."
2,Disappointing!,I have the same opinion voiced by so many others here. This book was a big disappointment for me. I was so excited about reading it too! I just didn't get the point.
3,Too many controversial subjects for one book,"Writing a book is one way of expressing your feelings particularly about things that gripe you. Author Welch-Tyson seems to have a gripe about almost everything and plays out her feelings in the personalities of her characters, most notably Aletha (a very uncomplementary composite of an Oprah Winfrey-like character). Unfortunately, all of the African-American women (except for Desiree who is married to a Jew), seem to be unrealistic and emotionally unstable. Ms. Welch-Tyson will undoubtedly offend many readers with her overly decriptive references to skin-color, hair texture, social position, and illegitimacy. I feel this book tried to cover too many controversial subjects. Christmas at the Brown's was somewhat ridiculous, but still amusing. The murder on the talk show was just plain ridiculous and very unnecssary."
3,I was disappointed,"This was a book that I looked forward to reading, but after reading it I was disappointed and confused. It just seemed like something was missing, like the thread that tied everything together. I could not understand why Debra and Veronica were major characters. Those 2 characters were not well developed and did not really contribute to the novel. I have to admit although, Christmas at the Browns made the book worth the time it took to read!"
