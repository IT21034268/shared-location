5,Jazz Fan,"I used to listen to Jerri Adams in the '50s but hadn't heard much from her since. I was listening to ""Music Choice"" last week, and they played one of her songs, which reminded me of her, and I was glad they did. I then purchased the CD, and I think it is a great one. Ms. Adams is excellent on every song. The quality of her voice and phrasing are outstanding. A real pro, yet she was only in her 20s when she made the recordings. There are actually two records in the one CD, ""It's Cool Inside"", which was originally released in 1956, and ""Play For Keeps"", which was originally released in 1959. I can't say that one is better than the other. I liked them both a lot. I wish there were more Jerri Adams CDs around so I could buy them."
5,K2 = A1,"If you are a cliber or interested in climbing adventures this is a gem of a book, will hold you from cover to cover. If you simply enjoy adventures it will also work the same. Can really recommend this for those wich such a heart, an interest in climbing/adventure, and it is also a nice read if you are keen to catch a glimpse of such an area (if you are not a climber or keen on mt. adventures).Would make a great gift for those interested interested in these areas/topics."
5,Loved it,This was a great book and i enjoyed all the photographs as well. I really enjoyed this read. Highly recommend!
3,!!!,"Very interesting book but hard to follow. If I'm confused at the BOttleneck section, I'm sure it was even worse being there."
3,K-2 and Everest --what a deadly combo!,K-2 is truly a deadly mountain---charles writes a compelling story of the true event that shaped many lives!Murder on Everest (A Summit Murder Mystery)
5,Must have.,Ubuntu is by far the best Linux distro now a days. With this OS there's really nor reason to be sticking with windows operating system.However if you have a cd burner on your pc don't waste your money here download it for free (legally) and Ubuntu website and burn it to a CD it's exactly the same thing and will cost you nothing.
1,What a waste of a book!,"The Beginners series is overall a good thing, with many excellent introductory level editions on thinkers. Most, like the ones on Satre, Kierkegaard and Heidegger are excellent (especially since reading those authors primary works is difficult if not impossible). Thats why I am so saddened by this terrible introduction on old Fred. First of all, the art is pretty bad. Second of all, it makes no real attempt to explain what Nietzche said and wrote. Instead it is full of out of context qoutes with little or no analysis and/or explanation. Very poorly done."
2,Disappointing compred with Sartre For Beginners,"Nietzcsche for Beginners, compared with Sartre for Beginners is highly disjointed, contains distracting grammatical errors, and does not give the beginning reader a solid sense of Nietzche's ideas. Terms are poorly explained, pictures are often apparently irrelevant or tangential to accompanying text, and ideas do not appear to logically build upon each other. I am a graduate doctoral student in clinical psychology and I found this book marginally useful and ill suited for true beginners."
2,"Bad translation, editing.","One thing that continually goes through my mind while reading the ""Beginners"" Series is that these books must have been originally written in another language (French? Spanish) and translated to English. A translator is listed in the credits. Anyway, the translation is HORRIBLE. The sentence structure is all messed up -- and I continually find myself re-reading the same sentences over and over just trying to get the gist of it. The book is horribly disorganized. Just got the book two nights ago -- and gave up on it. I'll buy another Nietzsche book and toss this one. ALSO: Philosphy for Beginners sucks just as bad -- with the added bonus that it is riddled with misspellings and typos."
1,A disgrace to Nietzsch,"This book doesn't attempt to try to explain Nietzsche's philosophy. Furthermore you're left confuse since there is a lot of ideas, people and event that are not fully explain but instead it just throws these thinks at you and also tries a lame attempt in being funny and all you're left with is disappointment of ever buying this book."
2,Not a good introduction to Nietzsche...,"This is a prime example of where everything is so disjointed that a coherent picture cannot be formed. Nietzsche's thought is not systematically approached, and the reader will (perhaps) find themselves lost."
2,Disappointing compared with Sartre For Beginners,"Nietzcsche for Beginners, compared with Sartre for Beginners is highly disjointed, contains distracting grammatical errors, and does not give the beginning reader a solid sense of Nietzche's ideas. Terms are poorly explained, pictures are often apparently irrelevant or tangential to accompanying text, and ideas do not appear to logically build upon each other. I am a graduate doctoral student in clinical psychology and I found this book marginally useful and ill suited for true beginners."
2,"Great subject, tedious writing","Capital Group is a phenomenal organization and I was very much looking forward to reading the book. Unfortunately, the book is very poorly written and is just plain dull. The footnotes (half of the book!) are silly at times in their excruciating level of irrelevant detail. Very little tangible information, in my opinion, on the actual subject of investing at Capital."
2,didn't work,"Recieved item with box being in decent condition. Removed packaging, followed instructions, turned on the product and watched as it was inable to completely inflate. Not sure whether it was defective or just cheap, either way i attempted to reach the seller by Email and phone , but with no success. No one wrote back nor responded to my message left on their answering machine. In conclusion i ended up throwing the product away."
4,Pretty good Spanish grammar book,"I bought this book for a once a week Spanish class that I'm taking. The class is kind of upper/beginning level and the text works rather well for what's being taught in class--a good amount of written grammar and vocabulary exercises that provide preparation for the oral grilling that we get in class. The material is well organized and each chapter introduces a lot of new material, with a strong focus on grammar. The explanations of verb conjugations, variations etc. are clear and the book could be used in a self-learning situation.Overall, not a bad textural foundation for studying Spanish."
2,NO ME GUSTA QUE PORQUERIA........ESO ES FOLKLOR COLOMBIANO,"sOLO tIENE 2 cANCIONES bUENAS pARA MI nO qUE sON FIESTA DE TAMBORES Y MI BOMBOM Y SUS 4 REMIXES QUE VIENEN EN EL CD, AH Y COLOMBIA TIERRA QUERIDA, AH Y TU BOCA , NO VALE LA PENA COMPRAR ESTE CD POR TRES CANCIONES O 4."
2,So Dissapointed,I was thrilled to find this product only to open itand find that the cups were plastic and had to begreased a bit. Such a nice quality pan and coverto use plastic cups - ugh! I returned it.
1,Plastic Egg Cups = Bad Idea,The plastic egg cups insulate the eggs from cooking. This means the eggs cook a little from the top due to steam. My dad had to boil so long the pan went dry and the cups caught on fire!!!
1,Not as advertised,The details said the poacher was nonstick inside and out. That was not the case. The inserts were plastic and stuck more than anything. The merchant was good about returning my money when I returned the poacher.
3,Poaching made easy,"This is a very well made product, but I wish the individual egg containers were non-stick. If I forget to spray the containers with Pam, the eggs stick and it's pretty tough to clean."
3,Misleading Egg Poacher Description,"While the Farberware egg poacher works well enough, I was stunned to discover that the egg cups are not made of a non-stick material (they are plastic). Only the piece that holds the four cups is non-stick, and who cares if that part is non-stick. This is false advertisement and fairly outrageous."
3,"works, but eggs stick!","This does poach the eggs, but even with lots of cooking spray they do stick. I even tried spray and butter, and they still stuck. The handles to each egg section get very hot, and they are difficult to grasp with a hotpad."
5,Egg Poacher,This is exactly what I wanted. I purchased a novelty one for my wife (It's plastic and looks like a chicken) but it really didn't work too well.This one works perfectly and was priced right.
3,Where is the key!,"I'm sure that this product is as great as other people have said, but it is ridiculous that the key is sold separately! What a joke!"
3,Tot Locs,I did not realize you need to buy a separate key to operate these magnetic locs and will likely be returning the items.
1,tot loks work,"I installed the totlocks on the bottom cupboards in my daycare area. They are not visible from the room and do a great job of making the cupboards notaccessible to the little ones. I keep the magnet on a top shelf that is easy for me to see and reach. Having used a combination of drawer/shelf protectors in the past, I love that these are unseen and do not make anymarks on the front of the wood."
1,Locks you can't install DON'T KEEP BABY SAFE!,"I lock you can not put on the cabniet, unless you have unlimited time, patience, and cabinet doors, will not keep little hands out. We have owned these locks for over a year and have yet to master installation. They are furstrating to install and damaging to cabinet doors.Go for simple and affective. Five minutes to install is far safer than not installed at all."
2,Only for Solid Doors,"After we finally figured out the instructions for installation (the pictures were so tiny), we installed one correctly. Then, when we tried to install the second one, we found out that our doors aren't solid. The small magnet part fell all the way to the bottom. After 30 minutes of trying to extract the magnet from the door, we finally installed that, but the parts just didn't fit well together. This was more trouble than it was worth, and we purchased the old-fashioned ones. It was also much more expensive than the old-fashioned ones. Oh well, we probably would have lost the magnetic key in a few months anyway."
2,Too frustrating to install!,"I had heard that these locks were supposed to be so good and childproof, and bought them despite the cost. When I tried to install them I just got really frustrated with how many holes you have to drill per lock, the tedious measuring you have to do, and I accidentally drilled all the way through the door in one spot... My own fault, I know, but the huge drill bit size and the multiple holes per lock makes this too possible... I got so annoyed I gave up, and quickly and easily installed some ""regular"" white plastic locks instead, and will return the magnetic ones. My son is only 1 so he may still figure out how to open the white locks as he gets older, but until then I will spare myslef the frustration of trying to install the magnetic locks on 13 doors...! If you do buy these locks, make sure a very patient and precise person can install them...! Good luck!"
4,The best cabinet locks. The worst installation instructions.,"These cabinet locks really are wonderful. Once installed, there is no sign of them. My 1 year old tugs on the drawers like crazy and they won't budge. We were even able to use this lock under our kitchen sink that has a very strange cabinet shape.On the flip side, the installation instructions are terrible! Watch the following video for a great installation overview: [...]The installation stickers that are provided do work very well."
5,Safety 1st Tot-Lok,"Great product! I found I didn't need this set after all, at least not yet. I bought it to keep my new cat out of the cabinets, but she lost interest before I could install them. I do already have some install though from the previous owners."
3,OK lock but I have problems with it,"Like everyone else said, the instructions are terrible and it is really hard to install. I managed to install it to a perfect fit and it works ok but if you pull hard enough the door will still open. My son is pretty strong for a 16 month old and if he really tried, I think he would be able to open it with a little elbow grease. It is an OK product but I wonder if others have the same problem I have with pulling it with a little strength and having the cabinet doors still be able to open? I would love to hear from others and their comments on my problem."
4,Good locks for occasionally used cabinets,"We have several different type of locks we use to baby proof. These magnetic locks are very good about protecting little fingers and really keeping the kids out. However, we chose not to install them on all the cabinets because of the little magnetic opener. Our preschooler thinks its fun to take off with it, and if we store it somewhere out of reach, it takes way too long to open the cabinet to just get out toothpaste or whatnot. In the kitchen, you can store the opener high on the refrigerator, but again, you must retrieve it every time you want to open something.We use these locks on some of the high-risk, low-use cabinets we have. These include cabinets that store chemicals or sharp items like knives. Overall, a good product for the right place."
2,"Work well, but installation is horrible","These latches work well enough, and it's nice that they are invisible once installed. But installation was a painful process, involving copious use of profanity on my part. Some notable issues:- The microsized instruction sheet is nearly useless.- The screws are way too small. I had to use a #0 Phillips to tighten them: most people probably don't _have_ a screwdriver this small. You can try to use a #1 Phillips, but you'll instantly strip the screws. It's very difficult to get the screws tight.- So, you think, I'll just go to the hardware store and get bigger screws. But no: for anything larger you'd have to enlarge the holes in the lock, and there's just not much margin to drill them out bigger.This would be a fine product if the manufacturer had put a bit more (or any?) thought into installation."
5,Region 1 DVD Please!,Studios!Please consider KAFKA for your Region 1 DVD and BR plans. Made-on-demand is fine.I LOVE this movie!-- Jay
2,Misfire,Inspired by German expressionism and film-noir this film fails to be genuinely paranoid as a running Jeremy Irons through film-noir nighttime streets of this Eastern European city fail to convince. The conceit is a brilliant one as individualism and hope is crushed in a totalitarium state where conformity is demanded. I hoped for a disturbing ending similar to what Terry Gilliam did to his protoganist at the end of BRAZIL. That ending was truly organic to the storytelling. The ending to KAFKA with Jeremy Irons did not have the chill factor I expected in this film. This is one of Soderbegh's early films and it shows. It needed to be deleriously paranoid and over-the-top. Apart from some startling visuals the film plays it extremely safe within the context of this genre. Soderbegh would go on and direct THE GOOD GERMAN and improve as a director from the soft movie that is KAFKA.
3,great opportunity to nap,"If you are having trouble sleeping, pop this into the VCR for a natural sleep-enhancer. The movie does have some appeal: Jeremy Irons; the idea of Kafka, the great author, coming to grips with day-to-day benality and the realization that he is part of that world; some great photography and music. Otherwise, I am still trying to figure out why I just did not buy a pizza."
3,"Solid, Tasteful Professional Chillout Tracks","All very nice - solidly professional, slick, calming, soothing and tasteful chillout tracks guaranteed to offend no one or raise too much notice ... perfect for an upscale hotel bar lounge.Not very adventuresome musically but if you just want background music that's slightly hip but nothing that would drive anyone away ... this is the CD for you."
4,shocking,"White isn't very shocking. If you put a rubber boot on it it is less shocking, but still shocking. Yahoo..."
1,Wrong name,This product is sold as a shock on this website. Im sure the product performance level is every bit what you pay for. But i bought this item thinking they were shocks themselves not absorbers & think its amazons falt for the bad promotion.
3,Outdated,"I bought this book eagerly because I could find nothing else similar. Sure enough, there is a great introduction to buses in Mexico and a well organized book of schedules, stations, fares and so forth. And, the book comes with a CD labeled ""2004 Updates."" The problem is that the CD requires a password. You are told to email bengi@yahoo.com for a password and request Password Number 18. I did. No response after several weeks. The author also provided his email address. I wrote him. No response after several weeks. The book is outdated and apparently the author figured out the importance of updates yet there is no way to open the CD. So, the book is helpful in providing an overview, but limited in its use due to lack of updating."
2,for most of Mexico this book is ok,"I purchased this book, in the hopes to expand my knowledge of the bus traveling experience for the Yucatan areas. This book is not designed to assist you with real adventure travel in the Yucatan / Quinta Roo area, and I wondered if the author had much experience traveling in the area. From personal experience in traveling extensively on the bus line for those areas- this book failed to deliver. I do not recommend this book unless you are traveling out of Mexico City."
1,Acting - Poor/ Script - Poor/Filming - Poor/ Effects - Poor,"This movie was fairly bad example of a bad horror movie. I found myself skipping over large sections to reach the good parts..... and not finding any. The fairly professional cover on the box was probably the best part of this movie, since it had no dialog."
1,"Save your money, or go blow it on Britney Spears instead...","What is this garbage? I made the mistake of buying this c.d. after hearing the song 'Anymore' which to my liking wasn't a bad song. They could have released a c.d. with just that song on it and I would have been just as happy as with the whole c.d. All of the songs are weak. Weak Vocals. Weak guitar riffs. If you're looking for some better nu-metal go buy a c.d. from Ill Nino, Dope, or Spineshank. I hope Switched doesn't decide to put out anymore c.d.'s in the future unless they change the way the songs sound on this album, they'd be doing us all a huge favor."
5,Amazing.,"I have searched for this cd for at least a year, and had no luck finding it, until I saw that it was on here for fairly cheap, so I ordered it, and I was very happy with it! Switched was one of the best Nu-metal bands of their time in my opinion, and shortly before I bought this one I found a single copy of their ""Ghosts In The Machine"" album at a local FYE and had to get it! Switched needs to get back together and continue making awesome music like this!"
4,"Catchy, heavy songs with a wide range of vocals","At one time, I was pretty much a sucker for all nu metal that was kinda underground and wasn't out for the money. Now, I find myself listening to few bands, such as Fear Factory, Type O Negative, and Machine Head. I've pretty much abandoned all the other guys. So why does switched fit in? Because they pull off emotion in great variety and it's not simply sounds battering your ears. Along with these guys I definitely recommend From Zero, who can be compared to these guys except more on the melodic side."
5,Blown away,"I first heard of Switched through their song ""10 Dead Fingers"" on the Music Channel. I liked it a lot but I didn't think too much of the band itself at the time till I heard ""Spread"" (which by the the way is a non-track album, its on their EP, now out of print). So I decided what the hell, I'll make the cd. I was definitely pleased with this cd, it rocks all the way through. The only ""soft"" song, if anything, is ""Walk Away,"" but it gets heavier towards the end, and thats the Switched we all (now) know and love. Besides the songs I mentioned there is also ""Four Walls,"" which has an amazing metal riff (so does ""Last Chance"" by the way) and their single w/ video ""Inside."" All of the songs on here rule, and if you have horrible taste in music then you won't like this band, period. They are nu-metal, but they add a different sort of element to the genre, and where nu-metal is concerned, that is needed many times."
5,Finally,"After a decade of waiting for this book, I am certainly not disappointed. As an avid mushroom hunter, I have to say that this is the best field guide I have found."
3,Its better than expected,"I found this used for under $5 so I gave it a shot. I'm not too familiar with the Rave genre but this set seems to sound good to me. It is, however, typical mid-2000 techno where there was very little to no creativity and every DJ was using the same equipment so minus two stars there. If you need a little bit of background noise for gaming I'm giving this album a big thumbs up."
5,great gift for the guy who has everything,I gave this as a gift to my cousin who was turning 40. Everyone loved it including him. Really is a good giftfor the guy who you never know what to get.
3,interesting,It wasnt what i thought it was going to be like but it was good all the same...thought it was going to be like those uncle john books.
5,The Original Bathroom Book,"Great addition to any library in or outside of the bathroom! Every single Book is edited down to a 1 page summary- in pain english. Such classics as Great Expectations whittled down to a 10 minute read, ""cliff note style"" without missing any pertinent information! LOVE IT!!"
1,Could be better,"I agree with the reviewer who commented on the editing and content. The editing is appalling, and I found a number of inaccuracies in some summaries (for example, Beethoven's first two symphonies contain the Sonata in c-minor and the Moonlight Sonata!) It makes me wonder where there are other inaccuracies I didn't catch because I don't know enough about the subject matter.Some of the content is interesting."
2,font too small,"Nice idea to put many great pieces together. Unfortunately the fonts are so small. I can hardly read it at this age of 50. Why the publishers always print so small fonts? If you agree, join my Facebook group ""I hate small fonts - Big Word Movement"" [...]"
3,Book ok Seller not at all,"The book was ok, but I orderd 2 books ans only one came. Also the shipping took a very long time."
3,Will is be Raven or Abby...,"Raven Stevenson needed a break to get her life together. What better place than Lakeview, Virginia. She wants to reconcile with her brother and come to terms with great hurts from her past. She didn't expect to find friends or a long ago unsolved Lakeview mystery. She also didn't count on meeting up with handsome writer Shane Montgomery or his old Aunt Abby who is suffering from dementia. Abby thinks Raven is a girl from her past that she knew and begins to talk in riddles revealing little tid-bits of secrets long ago. What does it all mean? It must mean something because someone is out to silence the past? Who is it? and are they after Raven or Abby? Will Raven come to terms with her past in time to have a future with the Shane?"
4,Great Joe Bender Fun,"As a hockey fan with an office this toy is prefect for me. It pretty much sits on my window sill looking cool all day. I don't really play with it much, just posed it to look like he is taking a shot and set it down. If you really like magnetic fun I'd suggest the Monkey Bender's with pop-up building. The description and picture are pretty much spot-on, so if you like what you see then get this product!"
5,"As advertised, a postage saver.","Perfect for many different items, as well as postage savers. Anyone who does any shipping should have these on hand."
3,gravy boat,"item was returned, and credit promptly returned, was received with saucer shattered. was not packed well.return was handled swiftly and item was returned at no cost to me"
3,For Mehldau enthusiasts only,"A good disc, but not alot of unique moments. This highlights alot of songs that show off Brad's talent for repeating patterns while letting drummer Rossy taking artistic license with the beat, it truly is a tribute to Rossy. ""Boomer"", ""Backyard"", and ""Happy Tune"", and ""August Ending"" all are great examples of this. There's some solid melodies, but after repeated listens I still have yet to find a track that resonates with me.That being said, the songs begin to meld together because of this similarity, which is a step back in my opinion from some of his work which is more dynamic (Art of the Trio 4 & 5, Places), experimental (the odd ""Largo"" experiment), or accessible (""Art of the trio 2"", ""Day Is Done""), or purely emotional (the solo ""Live at Tokyo"")."
2,Vacant view,"2 1/2While a solid average is still something in Mehldau's world, by all means hold out on buying this house until all other more valuable properties have been consumed. The disc starts well enough, but asides for a few invigorating themes the album lapses into muted dawdling."
5,An Absolutely Super Inspirational Book,"What a life Anita Bloom Ornoff has lived! She writes with a vivid clarity; her descriptions of all the events that are relevant to her life make you feel that you're right there. Parts of the book will just absolutely make you cry. Beyond Dancing is a wonderfully true story of inspiration, trials, failures, triumphs, courage, family difficulties and romance. Anita definitely has courage, courage, courage, and determination in an equivalent amount. This is one book you'll never forget!There are pictures in the middle of the book; these sure add alot to the story. I'm glad the decision was made to include them.The 300+ page book is divided into several chapters; I couldn't put the book down once I began reading it."
5,Keds,"Orignal purchase did not fit, returned item, received replacement item timely and without any probems. Would buy from this vendor without any hesitation."
1,Too Narrow,"I got a 9 Medium, and I don't know how anyone could fit their foot in that thing. I have average width feet, and this is the first time I have bought a show that said medium but was too narrow. Sad because I think otherwise they would have been comfortable.."
1,Shoebuy's Customer service is NO service at all,"I was given a pair of Keds from my daughter when we visited her for Christmas. She lives in CA and I live in DE. I was unable to pack the box the shoes came in for the flight home. When I returned home to Delaware, I tried the shoes on to discover that they are too narrow. It wasn't until I tried to exchange them that I learned that I needed the original box or they wouldn't accept them. Now my daughter is out $35.00 and I have a pair of shoes that I can't wear! I will NEVER purchase anything from this company EVER! They don't care about customer service at all!"
2,Keds,"Great service for delivery! I had to return the shoes because they were too wide. I am still awaiting my refund. The return process is more complicated because the shoes are considered a drop-ship item. There was no return label, so I had to call to find out where to return them. My only suggestion would be button up that part of the process and make it a little more customer-friendly.Keds Women's Champion Basic Slip-on"
2,Sole fell apart,"Not sure whether we simply got a bad pair or what...within 2 weeks, the sole was separating from the shoe, causing my daughter to flop down the hallway."
2,Not my sieze,i sent back the shoes because they were the wrong size and thought that I could get another pair sent back to me. No such luck. I have to buy them all over again. Why not an even exchange?Keds Women's Champion Basic Canvas Slip-On
4,Keds,"This is a shoe I bought a few years ago, and wore out so I needed to buy a replacement. This shoe has pleased me for comfort and ease of stepping into. The sole isn't quite as thick as my old pair, but that is the only negative I give them. I'm enjoying them."
5,Awesome.,"The Ked's i ordered were just perfect. They sent the right size, right color everything. I have had past expriences where I received 2 shoes different sizes or different color. I am very satisfied."
1,Alert--KEDS has changed the design of this shoe!,"Just an alert--KEDS has just changed the design of this shoe, and it no longer resembles the KEDS Champion we all knew and loved. The thick, 3-part sole is gone, as is the terry lining and insole. The arch support is non-existent, and the semi-circular heel pad (the part that touches your Achilles tendon) is not there. The fabric is thin and cheap. KEDS has altered the shoe so it now resembles a $5- slip-on from Wal-Mart.Looks like its going to be Vans for me."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Having grown up wearing Keds sneakers, I was pleased to find that they had re emerged on the market. However, these slip ons are the worst sneakers ever. They are very narrow and have ZERO support in the soles. Poor quality, in my opinion..don't waste your money on these!"
1,"Awful fit, irregular/defect?","I have worn keds slip-ons like this for years and never had this problem before.I don't know the technical names, but the height between the insole and the upper is so short I can't even get my foot in the thing! If you look at the picture where the ""tongue"" part is raised, this pair is flat. I even tried putting powder in the shoe to force slip it on and I can't get my foot in at all.Very disappointed and I feel like this may be a ""second"" or ""irregular"", not an actual Keds for retail, which would explain the lower cost as well.Very disappointed."
1,These are no longer the great shoes they used to be,"December 2009I have been wearing these slip-on Keds around the house for years. The fit well and have a decent arch support. Have tried other slip-ons and always come back to these because of the fit. When I can find them in the stores they usually only carry white. Was very pleased to get a chance to choose other colors. The navy color, however, is very dark and at first glance I thought they sent black by mistake.07/07/2011I just purchased another pair of Keds, ignoring the recent review that these shoes are no longer the same. I hoped there was some explanation for that buyer's experience and was willing to take a chance on having to return them. But, sadly, the reviewer was 100% correct on every point - these are not the same Keds slip-ons I used to buy.I am shipping them back for a refund, but please note that ShoeMall does not reimburse shipping costs."
3,Keds canvas slip ons,"I was happy that Keds offered a canvas slip-on shoe in wide widths and in the color that I wanted. When I purchased the shoes, I was looking for an inexpensive shoe to wear around the house rather than a shoe for serious walking. However, I quickly realized that the shoe did not provide the foot support that I needed. Also, because I have a high instep, that particular style was not suitable for me. Consequently, I would not recommend this style shoe for those with a high instep or for those who need strong arch support for walking even for short distances."
1,Not the Keds that I've known,"I have been an annual purchaser of these shoes. They are NOT the quality of Champion Basic Canvas shoes I've purchased in the past. I was disappointed in the product I received. Gone is the quality fabric. Gone is the thick sole. Gone is the lining. Gone is the arch support. In fact, there is no arch support. The new fabric is thin and cheap. They will not provide the comfort of past Keds slip-on shoes. They are not worth the $25 when I can find similar shoes at Walmart for $8. FORTUNATELY, I also ordered the Grasshoppers brand of canvas slip-on shoes thanks to reading a previous review on the Keds. They are fabulous. Same price and just like the ""old"" Keds quality....great fabric and comfort. NYC school field trip here I come with comfortable shoes!! Thanks Grasshopper! Better option: Grasshoppers Women's Tamra Slip-On Fashion Sneaker. I paid $25."
5,I like them. Very comfortable,My first Keds. Very comfortable for walking in. I wear 11W and they dont look too clunky. The quality of the material is very good. It has not frayed or anything.
3,Too narrow for me,"Even though I liked these tennis shoes and bought them in a wide size, I was surprised to see that they were still too narrow for me to wear so I wound up donating to charity. Good shoes just not right for me."
1,This world has no room for Wide-ees.,"Shoe sellers should have a unit of measurement for width. Inches and centimeters are only charted for length. I really, really don't think the average consumer knows whether they wear a 4A, M, C, 5E, etc. Most shoes in this world do not come with width labels! So, even though a slip on canvas was exactly what I wanted, I could only gamble at the limited selection of colors and sizes. I lost."
1,Way too narrow,"I've worn a 7M (in Keds) since my feet stopped growing (30 years ago) and suddenly they're way too narrow. First time for everything, I guess... Maybe Keds just mismarked the shoes--or they've changed how they've made a product that have fit me for 30 years.Stupid me, I didn't look at the return policy and Peltz Shoes doesn't do exchanges."
2,disappointing,"This one didn't have anything new, and I got much better instructions for sculpting from any of Pamela Gurney's books. (My favorite is Punchneedle Creations.)"
2,Errata,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. The online errata page falls miles short of pointing out all the errors and typos in this book. The last thing I want to do while trying to learn PHP is figure out why the code from the book doesn't work. And when I got it to work, it was always because of code errors. At first I started marking my book so I wouldn't waste my time again but it got rediculous. Now, all I want to do is sell this book but it's all scribbled over. Nonetheless, I'm NOT keeping this book on my library."
1,This book is a reference manual at best...,"If you are new to PHP, DO NOT buy this book. I can't believe all the good reviews here. There are no practical examples, and very little useful information. It is, at best, a reference manual. If you're new to PHP, check out David Powers' books."
5,Excellent resource,"This book was an excellent introduction to PHP 5. Coming from a J2EE background, Gilmore's precise and detailed explanations helped me understand what PHP 5 had to offer, engineer to engineer. Gilmore's book assumes that you're intelligent, and that you're interested in the details. He then explains those details in depths. All in all, an excellent book."
3,Meh,"It was a decent book. I've been reading this in my spare time during my High School classes... It offers an easy to read guide to beginning PHP. I must admit that there were some parts that were difficult to follow (mostly around the introduction to object oriented programming, as this was my first leap into OOP), but other than that, it was an easy read. Some of the examples in the book have typos, which added to my confusion. I was able to fumble the way through the typos thanks to php.net's online reference. All in all, this book offers a good introduction to the language, but it is by no means a desktop reference that you would want to consult after you get the basics of the language down. I believe that honor goes to php.net."
4,Well written and concepts clearly explained.,Liked the book very much.What I liked best about it was the simple and well-thought-outexplainations of some of the underlying technology that gohand-in-hand with PHP such as web services and web templates.Like all good authors Mr. Glimore goes a long way to demystifythe potential complexities of the technology and show us justhow easy it is to do something really useful in PHP.
1,Not for PHP beginners!,"Maybe beginners with PHP 5.0, but you definately need some prior PHP scripting experience for this book to be useful.Gilmore does not have any real life examples for you to try and build your knowledge on in this book. Only a couple of lines are for each different sub-topic. None of them are connected to previous lessons. Some of the ""examples"" is not complete code. Just how that particular function or command would look on a single line. Very poor for a beginners guide.I would have liked to see the book walk me through building some applications then tie them all together at the end before moving on to MySQL.I recommed PHP & MySQL Programming (3rd Edition) PRIOR to reading this book.After you can write your own simple PHP applications should you then move on to this book."
4,Great coming from a Perl background,"Having Perl knowledge, you can cover the first 200 pages in no time. If you haven't done any programming before, you might need to reference another book for more indepth examples. The bulk of the book is installing and configuring Apache/PHP/MySQL. I found myself skipping alot of it since I rent a server that already has it. I would give 3 stars for his review of PHP (should have provided more examples), and 5 stars for MySQL (feel completely confident exploring it now)."
5,Excellent learning tool,"I have a background in Visual Basic which definitely helped. The Chapter about setting up the Linux server I just skipped over but the rest of the book has been very good so far. I would recommend this book to anyone who has some programming experience (any, really) and would like to get into web database programming.It will also be valuable as a reference later on."
4,A great learning guide,"Within weeks of buying this book, I found that my copy rapidly become well worn from use. To me, that's a great indication of how useful and well-written a technical book is. The author's explantions are clear and to the point and the plentiful examples and code snippets really help illustrate the various concepts throughout the book. For me, I like getting my hands 'dirty' by playing with the example code because I find that I learn better that way. When I ran into a problem on an example that I was working on, I emailed the author with a few questions and he responded very quickly and was extremely helpful with suggestions and advice with which I was able to resolve my problem. I highly recommend this book for anyone trying to learn PHP and MySQL."
2,BCA Bearings Taper Bearing Cup,"I ordered two BCA 26822 bearing cups (outer races) to match the BCA tappered rolling elements. I received one 26822 made by Bower. The other was made by NTN. Both bearings came in bearing boxes, but the Bower cup was not wrapped, which is customary on all bearings for preservation purposes and to prevent contamination. All told, I was disappointed in what was sent to me, so I will probably never use Amazon again to by bearings and other mechanical items."
3,Honeymoon in Vegas,"This movie has a decent story line and some exciting moments, but nothing over the top. One of the things I liked most about this movie was seeing all the old scenes of Vegas back then, and how things have changed so much. All in all, its an ok movie that is interesting enough to watch, but not exactly something that you are dying to see."
3,"Pretty funny when it came out, not so much now","A young Nicolas Cage and an even younger Sarah Jessica Parker play for laughs in this romantic caper that seemed pretty funny about 18 years ago when it debuted. Time has eroded some of the yucks, though, but it's still worth a watch as a borrow or rental. Lightweight, and James Caan continues his reptilian schtick that he's played ever since Sonny Corleone."
4,Target Exclusive,"Gave it a 5 for finally coming out but a 3 for being a one store exclusive. Anyone who is wanting this, it's a Target store exclusive. $9.99 + tax"
5,Hilarious if you're in the right frame of mind!,"Many friends of mine didn't like this movie until I got them to notice its little quirky intricacies. Cage is fantastic as the melodramatic undercover cop; Parker and Caan do great supporting jobs in this special comedy. Some might feel Cage is overacting throughout the film, but that is what gives the movie its real special ""character."" Give it a shot."
1,No widescreen and no Dolby Digital 5.1 ???????????,WHY WHY WHY ? This is one of my all-time favorites movies! I thought the DVD would have it all....boy what a disappointment. Come on MGM! Smell the damn coffee!
4,The flying Elvises just crack me up!,"Although the DVD picture and sound quality are horrible, the movie is still hilarious. James Caan acting is so real, he was made for this movie, and I couldn't see anyone else besides maybe Robert De Niro in this role. Thumbs up for Mr. Caan.But for me, the show was stolen by the flying Elvises, I just crack up in that scene where the parachuting leader says ""We are the flying Elvises, Utah chapter!""Sarah Jessica Parker and Nicolas Cage make a fantastic couple in this movie, and Cage is just funny, he doesn't need to try hard to make you laugh.Pat Morita's (Remember Mr. Miyagi?) appearance also puts some additional fun in this already wacky comedy.Highly recommended for a lot of laughs! I took out one star for the low DVD quality, though."
2,Cliche,"The villain said one phrase that I hadn't predicted. The whole rest of the movie I had top to bottom. I even guessed the cloths the heroine was going to be wearing in the final scene.A couple goes to Vegas to get married; the guy gets in debt; the villain clears the debt on condition he can be with the guy's fiancee for a weekend. Of course, the villain claims nothing romantic; and of course, he starts romancing her the moment their out of sight; then of course, she falls for him; then of course, she falls back for the hero; and the end is happy.If you want that. I'll say this: for what they had to work with, the story was rather charming."
1,where's my movie?,I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY MOVIE I ORDERED FROM YOU ON MARCH 30TH. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT IS ACTUALLY TAKING OVER A MONTH FOR IT TO ARRIVE. I'M NOT SURE I'LL BE ORDERING FROM YOU AGAIN UNLESS I CAN GET MY ORDER SOON.
1,Honeymoon in Vegas,I received the movie and it wouldn't even play in my brand new blue-ray player. Very disappointed. It's one of my favorite movies. Don't sell something you know doesn't work
3,Okay,"this movie didnt have a real cover, it was in a cardboard insert, but what can you expect for it being so cheap! lol... overall the movie was great!"
3,Brilliantly Three Starred,"I was shocked and appalled by the amazingness of the neutrality in which I viewed this video. I could find nothing wrong or funny with it. It was completely and utterly even. I think, that this in and of itself, should deserve an award. Never have I seen such unbiased representation of life."
2,CD Case Issue,"So disappointed that this CD arrived in a clear plastic case rather than its original packaging. Had I known, I would not have ordered it."
3,DECENT LIGHT,"I initially bought this to be used as a key chain light. When I received it I found it to be a bit to big for a key chain flashlight. The only problem with the design of this light is that you have to leave the head loose and tighten it to turn on the light unlike to Mini Maglights that you leave tight and loosen to turn on the light. I do not know if this would be a problem carrying it in your pocket like that but I will not be finding out. It is fairly bright for a small light and I love that it runs on AA batteries. All in all it is a decent light but I find it to be to big for a ""key chain"" light."
3,"Narrow beam, I like Fenix E01 better","I have bought and reviewed 3 inexpensive compact LED flashlights.Fenix E01 Compact LED Flashlight- $12.73Streamlight 72101 KeyMate with White LED, Titanium- $9.78Garrity LED Aluminum Keychain Flashlight Nichia A100G- $9.99My top choice is the Fenix E01. I think it is worth the extra $3.Garrity A100GBattery: AAA (included, but mine was weak).Battery life: 12 hr.Brightness: Fair. Narrow beam. Brightness is good within the narrow beam. At 2' away, the beam is only about 7"" in diameter. Brightness will drop off as battery drains.Accessories: Key ring with ring clip.Switch: Twist can be done with 1 hand.Construction: Sturdy.Size: About the size of 2 AA batteries.Warranty: LifetimeComments: Okay if you want a narrow beam and you do not mind the relatively large size."
3,Bright and big too big,The Light is bright enough but this light is a little to big to have on the keys. I recommend a smaller streamlight nano which is almost as bright and less than half the size.
1,totally boring,The only redeeming quality was Elias Koteas. And the review is requiring 13 more words to describe this awfulness....just bad and not worth the 2 hours
5,An Absolute Pipterina!,"I say old thing, I didn't even know about this series until I happened upon it here on Amazon. Once I read all the other great reviews I had to have it. Now that I've seen it, I have to review it because it's a jolly good classic. I must say, 6/7 of the episodes are ""the tree upon which the fruit of my love hangs."" (however, the Minna Nordstrom episode fails to qualify) Before receiving this series, I had already collected all the Jeeves and Wooster DVD sets. I hadn't expected this one to be quite as good, but I actually find that I watch it even more often. As a matter of fact, I probably watch this one the most of all the DVD's I own! John Alderton and Pauline Collins are excellent actors and play the different characters swimmingly. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves British comedy. There are also 2 other seasons out on DVD that I'm looking forward to getting. (hint, hint) If they're anywhere near as good as this season, I know I will love them. Toodle-pip!"
2,Funny?,"Really unusual people must have written the other reviews. Funny? Did they say funny? This isn't funny . . . in any tradition, and those introductions by poor old Wodehouse are unbearable and barely decipherable. The absence of coarseness and vulgarity is appreciated, but for humour these productions are a vast wasteland with only an occasional oasis."
4,"However, I'd rather do my own laughing.","These stories are hilarious, & the actors perform them well. I shall try to find a volume of Mulliner stories to read.After enjoying the Jeeves & Wooster series, however, I was appalled by the canned laughter in Wodehouse Playhouse. I wonder if Wodehouse, who introduces them, objected."
4,from the master of British humor,"This series is classic British comedy with an introduction by the old fellow himself.I've read some of the JeevesThe Inimitable Jeeves (The Collector's Wodehouse)stories and this has the same quality of creeping up on your comedy boneand taking it by surprise.The stammerer who can't say he loves his girl and taking the doctor's orderstries to talk to three strangers. When he offers tea to the third stranger aftershe was told a madman was loose, he gets chased over the English countrysideand shot at, but the fear cures him...Similar episodes where the improbable becomes typical Britishmake us laugh."
4,"Silly, often funny, sometimes brilliant.",Wodehouse afficianados will want to add this series to their collection. A mixed bag with some hilarious characterizations from Pauline Collins and John Alderton.
2,Farberware skillet,"I bought this and some other pans in the set. Very disappointed. I have a glass cooktop, and when the pans heat up, they warp. Then return to their normal shape when they cool down. Guess I got what I paid for."
5,targets a very diverse audience,"I listened to the album all day yesterday the quality of the songs is amazing.There is something on this album for everyone from the catchy up beat tracks such as Aint that something to the ballads such as So loved and What loves about.There is a message about life in every song and the albulm is a credit to Ace.Get the album now ,I did and now i cant turn it off.Its the best albulm Ive bought in a long time.Congradulations Ace you are truly a star."
2,Good blue lights but finish is not as good as I had expected,"I bought this product because I needed a USB keyboard. I really like the blue lights since I like working in the dark but the other components are of poor quality. By that I mean the keys and rest pad, the stuff you 'touch'. They don't feel all that rigid nor do they feel a punch. The rest pad is all plastic no soft cushions or surface finishing.Great looking keyboard but the touching aspect is a bit lacking.Sorry, was expecting too much for $34 bucks."
2,"keys starting to ""blur""","I have been using this keyboard for about 2.5 months, and a number of the most commonly used keys are starting to ""blur"". It seems as though something is happening to the grey covering that's allowing more of the blue light to shine through so that the letters appeared blurred.I can't think of anything that I could be doing to cause this: My hands are clean and I don't drop/spill things on the keyboard.I just wrote Saitek and I'm sure that they'll replace the keyboard, but that means my expense in sending it to them, and I have no reason not to think it'll happen again.I note that one of the reviewers of the Eclipse II posted a photo of exactly the same thing happening to him."
2,Not as great as it looks,"After a few months the paint on the spacebar, c, v, n, m keys wore off leaving me with blue glowing splotches rather than letters on the keys. Also, the backlight really isn't as bright as the pictures make it seem. Some keys click louder than others when you type as well. If you can see past these issues it's a fairly solidly built keyboard."
1,Keyboard Keys Stick,After a few months the some of the keys stopped working. The Saitek Web Site is a joke. No one returned my email. A large waste of money.
1,Don't Buy It,"I have two firefly borealis lighted boards and thought that the saitek would take me to the next level. However, the keys are not uniformly lit and the keystroke is very annoying tactily. I disconnected the saitek after 5 minutes of use and reconnected the firefly which is 100% better than this junk. A. Palmer"
2,Erratic behavior,"Always desired this keyboard and finally purchased it. Everything worked great, loved the lighted keyboard and soft touch keys. Unfortunately after awhile my system started responding erratically, after troubleshooting, I found that when I used another keyboard all of the problems went away! Requested a replacement and recieved it very fast, still not sure if all issues have been resolved, but will see. Extremely impressed with how fast I recieved the replacement and how simple returning the original was, most impressive!"
2,Saitek Eclipse Paint Problem,"Pros: Everything I was looking for in a keyboard. It's backlit, which is a fantastic feature in a dark room. The key response is very nice. Not too soft and not too hard.Cons: I use it quit a bit for gaming, with the home keys receiving most of the use. The paint has worn off badly on the A,S,and D keys and is starting to wear on the X key. The problem with this is that if you're not an excellent typist and need to look at the keys in a dark room the characters are gone on these keys and all you see is light shining through.The company said they can't replace the keys, but I had to ship the keyboard back to them and they would look into the problem. Not the answer I was looking for. Had they backpainted the keys instead, you wouldn't be able to wear the paint off the keytops and obliterate the characters.I wouldn't purchase another one."
4,great keyboard,this keyboard is good...you have to get used to it..the board has 2 light brininess levels high and low and it looks great when you stand up and look at it...i wish it would be BRIGHTER its great for night gaming you can see all the keys in the dark i have no problem and if your woundering the little hand rest is plastic not some cushion to nor soft its a great buy for 30$ buy it..
4,pleased and slightly disappointed,"Out of the box I loved this keyboard, the key feel is great, the back lighting (with high/low and off settings) is just the thing I was looking for. One month into use, and not hard use by any means, I can't get settings button to work. I hate to see it remain lit all the time so I unplug the USB, kinda a drag, if I hadn't tossed the box I'd send it back for a replacement...I am hoping for YOUR sake that is an isolated case because it is really a nice keyboard for the price. I even thought of buying one for my parents as a gift until I had trouble."
3,"Not too durable, but great for games!","I have had my Saitek Eclipse Keyboard for about 6 months now. It is used daily for about 2-3 hours which includes internet surfing, word processing, and gaming. Very recently (after 6 months of use) it has begun to act up. The lights are flickering and occasionaly certain keys stop working. This is very annoying when you are in the heat of an online game (BF 2142). I am very careful with my electronics and nothing is abused.I am sad that it is acting up as I really enjoyed this KB! It types very well and the keys are tactile and springy with good key press travel distance. Keyboards generally last a year or two, this however is on its last legs at 6 months."
5,Glowing Keyboard,"This works and feels the same as any great standard keyboard. The keys press easy and they don't create much noise. Most of the time I just want to look at it rather than use it. I can type well without looking at the keyboard so it's kind of distracting considering. On the other hand when I'm not using the keyboard it sort of pulls you in to use it. Odd feeling when theres nothing to use it for at those times.I read some people say the light isn't bright enough, but I think it's well lit and works awesome. It's nice to be able to see the keys this way. So far everyone around me who has seen it wants one for themselves. It's worth buying. It looks like it cost more than advertised."
1,not worth the money,"[[ASIN:B000WKXP32 ECLIPSE KEYBOARD]I didn't have this keyboard for 2 weeks and the letters on the keyboard smeared that you could not tell what they were,the main reason that I had gotten this keyboard was for my husband to see the keys but he cannot see them with the lights on in the room due to the keys being smeared.Was a waste of money and very dissapointed,will never buy another one,what a rip off."
2,Backlight not near bright enough,"While I really like the key action on this keyboard, and the fact that it feels solidly built, the blue backlighting is not anywhere near the brightness it needs to be, even on the highest brightness setting...there are 2 brightness levels. I see all these fantastic reviews...hmmm...maybe mine's a dud."
5,Great Item,I really love this keyboard. I love the light and it is so easy to use. The keys are so easy type on that I actually am typing with fewer mistakes. Love this!
1,Does not work with KVM switch,"The keyboard is probably great if you can plug it directly into your PC, but I use a KVM switch to go back and forth between two PCs, and the keyboard does not work at all with the switch. After purchasing it, I found an article on the Internet saying that a person called the company to ask about swtich compatibility and they said it's not compatible and they have no plans to make it work. They also could not say why it didn't work. I'm sad that I had to return it. Here's a link to the article... http://www.virtual-hideout.net/reviews/saitek_eclipse/index3.shtml"
5,After almost four years still going strong!,"I purchased this wonderful keyboard in 2005 and as of this product review, all is good. I use my Saitek mostly for emails and essays. When I decide to take a break for game time, I mostly use a mouse. I can understand that should a serious gamer use the Saitek Eclipse, specific gaming keys will certainly show signs of wear. Sweaty, Doritos encrusted fingers will in time destroy the silver finish on the Saitek keyboard. LOL. However, for the rest of us who simply want a nice, comfortable typing experience - I say buy this without hesitation. The beautiful blue back lit keys are a wonderful bonus when typing in low light conditions. Try it, you'll like it. Peace."
1,Poor support,"I purchased this keyboard in January, and at first liked it quite a bit. The backlighting is accomplished by painting the keys silver, and leaving the letters bare so it shines through each letter. Unfortunately, within about a month one of the keys (A) had the paint so worn off as to be unreadable. This has since spread to 5 other keys, making it a mess to look at, and making the backlight worthless.Contacted the parent company (Saitek in the UK), who referred me to their US counterpart, Madkatz. I've contacted them three times for either replacement keys or a replacement keyboard, to no avail. They claim everything from ""we don't have keys"" to ""we will send replacements right out"", and they never do.Do not buy. You will regret the expenditure as soon as the keys begin to wear, and they will not back up their product. Very dissatisfied."
5,A First Rate Keyboard in addition to looking good,"While it would be nice to have multi-media keys other than volume and mute, this keyboard is first rate. It has a great feel while typing and looks great. Unlike other lit keyboards the letters are translucent while the keys themselves are opaque. This reduces glare in low light and makes the keys easy to read. The keyboard lies absolutely flat on the desk, which I do not like. But I found that the supplied plastic wrist rest, when placed under the back of the keyboard, sets it at a nice angle. I have a gel wrist rest so I didn't need the plastic one. Also the keyboard and wrist rest have nice traction on the desk so they don't slide around. A great product, and when I purchased Amazon had the best price."
2,Keyboard,"After only one month, the lighting on the keyboard is failing. many keys do not light at all. Lighting is very uneven.One good feature is the sound control keys on the keyboard,but Iwould not buy this keyboard again as I wanted a keyboard to use in the dark. I leave the light on the keyboard turned on all the time. It might be better to turn the light on only whenneeded."
1,Definitely NOT a good keyboard for heavy gaming use,"I bought this keyboard to complement a custom-built gaming PC, and we've used it almost daily for 2+ years. This includes typing a LOT as well as using it to play games on the PC.It has not held up well at all. After 2 years, the space bar doesn't work properly anymore, and 8 of the keys have started to lose their gray coating (unlike most keyboards, they keys are actually clear plastic with a gray coating, so that light can shine through the letters).I don't have incredibly high standards for something as simple as a keyboard, so I've been surprised at how disappointing this has been. Look elsewhere if you're planning on investing in a long-term piece of equipment or you're a heavy PC user--this product is mostly flash with little substance to back it up."
5,Amazing,"Key strokes are perfect not too long and not too short. Though a little louder then say your average run of the mill default keyboard its got a nice sound that lets you know you have hit the key. The build quality is excellent and feels as though i could throw it and it wouldn't break. Though there are only 3 media buttons (sound up/down and mute) thats all any real computer needs. And the back light is perfect. in pitch black conditions its more then bright enough to see every key crystal clear. Even in fully lit conditions the back light is bright enough to make the keys seen. My friend has a G15, which i use all the time, and i prefer this keyboard. Better key feel, smaller more convinient and 1/2 the cost. Its perfect."
2,decent keyboard with cool but ineffective lighting,"I like the feel of this keyboard even though the tilt needs to be higher. Trouble is, the backlighting shines up through the keys in such a way that it's very hard to see, especially at the lower angle. I'm sure this would be fine if you were a touch typist but since I'm not it's a waste of money for me. If you just want it to look cool, this might be for you. If you really need to see the keys in low light, look elsewhere."
3,Great idea but didn't help my eyes,I like the idea but the built in light still is not sufficient to help my eyes. I still need an overhead light.
2,Warning: Glitches on really fast typing.,"If you type really quickly (over 110 wpm) you will find that this keyboard sometimes switches the characters you type around so that the leftmost character is registered first. Example: if I type ""would have"" quickly, I often get ""woudl ahve"" instead. Note that this is a reproducible glitch and has to do with poor hardware design of the keyboard itself, not with my style of typing--these glitches don't happen on my laptop's keyboard when I use it.This keyboard also does not allow you to press 3 keys simultaneously for some combination of keys (for example, the keys r y u cannot be pressed at the same time. This also affects a few other keys that are used in FPSes, etc.)I would not recommend this keyboard to anyone who is serious about gaming or speed typing."
1,Forget the good reviews here!!!!!!!!,No matter how this keyboard looks or feels there is just no excuse for the paint coming off the keys. I have it for about eight months now and about five keys are starting to go. I only use the keyboard moderately so I can't even imagine what it would be like for someone who would use it heavily. If I could give it no stars I would!
1,Do Not Buy,"LOVED this keyboard for the first few months - great touch - love the backlighting - very cool plus I work in low light often. But then it stopped working - keys don't respond - rebooting helps for a while. I let it sit for a couple menths then plugged it back in and it worked fine for about a month then went bad again. Based on what I have read this is not a fluke but how these keyboards ""work"" or don't work - all glowing reviews are from people in their first few months of use. Great keyboard if you want to spend $35 for 6 months... still looking for a dependable illuminated keyboard..."
5,Beautiful and Handy,"Purchased for parents, kept, sent them my old keyboard.Pro:Full size keyboardBacklit keys w/ high/low/off settingsVolume hot keysFully adjustable w/ wrist restSolid quality constructionCon:Numlock, caplock and scrollock are too brightI fixed the brightness of the lock keys with one swipe of black permanent marker."
2,no good,i have had this keyboard for over a year i noticed my wasde buttons are all worned out both the paint and the rubber underneath the key. when i hold 2 or more buttons the keyboard starts to have trouble maintaining its function and it gives the gamer a hard time whilst he is gaming i would not recommend it
3,OK Keyboard,Purchased this product for it's lighted keyboard effect. That works great. The keyboard itself is average in it's functionality and appearance.
4,"Great Product, Great Price","One of my coworkers had purchased this cool keyboard, with backlighting and quiet keys, for herself and another worker. This price for the exact product was considerably less than what she paid."
1,Illuminated keyboard,This keyboard was a dissapointment. I am somewhat viaually challanged. The backlighting is done in such a way that it make the keys more difficult to see. A plain white keyboard with black lettering would be much better. The blue light would possibly appeal for some one wanting a fancy board.
3,I like the backlit keys,"It's light and compact too. Just a basic keyboard, no extra function keys or frills, and the palm rest is a little flimsy, just a piece of plastic that comes off when you move the keyboard around. It's a little pricey for what you get, but I'm happy with it."
5,Great Gift for Gamers,Bought this keyboard as a Christams gift and he seems to really like it. Looks cool in the dark too. Glad to have spent the money on something he wanted.
5,AWESOME Keyboard!!!!!!!!!!,"My keyboard was shipped and here in no time. The packing was professionally done, no way that the keyboard would have been damaged during shipment. I purposely waited before submitting my review so I could test drive the keyboard. If anyone does late night/darkness typing, as I do, THIS is the item you should purchase. The keys are lit enough to see properly, but has an on/off switch so you can turn the backlight off during lighted computer use. It is totally awesome!!! I hope this never breaks down, but should it, I hope I can order another. Thank you for whoever invented this. It has improved my productivity on the pc more than you know. I also kept the plastic that it came in on the keyboard, and taped it with clear tape. That way it stays clean and no crumbs/ashes will spill into the keys. This keyboard is worth typing on plastic. :-)"
3,Good keyboard marred by poor materials,"I've had mine for 5 months now and initially was an excellent keyboard no problem with it, but after time keys with frequent use began sticking. The problem is the rubber dome switch pad under the keys is not up to standard of gaming use (i.e. constant fast and hard repetitive pushing and holding down for long periods of time) and eventually tears the dome causing keys to stay down and engaged. It's a good keyboard for basic users but calling it a gaming keyboard is a joke."
1,Not really for gamers,"I'm very sad to report that I had to return this otherwise excellent keyboard, because on certain combination of key strokes it stops detecting subsequent keys strokes.For example if I press up arrow, left arrow and Ins key. They keyboard will ignore Ins key.I had to go back to my old crappy, bulky, $19 dollar, and uncool Microsoft keyboard.The people at Saitek told me they know of this problem and they can't do nothing about it. I just wished I had looked in the Saitek forums before purchasing this item, because a lot of people have posted the same problem.To bad because everything form this keyboard is excellent, aside from the most basic thing, well for a gamer anyways."
2,Keys Wear Out Quickly and Often,"When the keys started to blur on my Saitek 2 and I had replaced them twice, I thought that I'd go down a notch and get this keyboard. I DO like the idea of a backlit keyboard. However, I've had the same problem with this Saitek: see photo in gallery, and you'll see that the B, C, and U are becoming unreadable. Yes, I used the same photo for both keyboards: the only difference was that the N, G, O, and five others blurred on the other keyboard.Saitek has told me that they are aware of the problem, but when they sent another set of keys for a full board, they wore out in less than a month. Since they do guarantee their product, perhaps it's worth a chance for you. For me, I'm going back to the old tried and true board that I got from Logitech.P.S. the backlighting - at least in blue - doesn't give off enough light to really ""define"" the keys. Since I'm not a touch typist, this is even more critical than keys wearing out."
2,Slow Key Action,"While this keyboard looks good and is nicely weighted to keep it in place, it's performance is so-so. The key action is soft, resulting in the keys responding slowly when tapping one key rapidly. I sometimes play old games online using the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to shoot. The keys would not respond quickly enough. Eventually the right arrow key started sticking in the on position, resulting in my frequent death. I returned the keyboard."
2,Saitek Eclipse (blue),"Illumination so dim as to be entirely useless, which was the reason I got the keyboard. Otherwise, the keyboard functions fine, but is no better than my stock Dell keyboard, and therefore not worth the price. I took it apart to replace the LEDs with brighter ones, and discovered that there are only FIVE tiny surface-mount LEDS on a strand lighting the entire keyboard. There should be at least twice that number. Decided not to bother and ordered a Firefly Borealis instead."
2,"Smudging keys, hard see keys unless it is dark","My keys are pretty smudged, at the moment, the A,S,D,E,C,V,B,N,L,LEFT SHIFT,and space bar are barely readable. Also unless you are in a very dark room, the keys are easier to read with the LED turned off. As for operations, it works fine, no bad keys, no erratic behavior. This is why it pains me to get a new keyboard, but I can't take it anymore. I will probably keep it as a backup keyboard."
2,Love the feel of it but the keys wore off in 3 weeks,"As others have said, the keys wear down on this way too fast. I've only had mine a few weeks, and the E is already one big blob of blue... and the T isn't far behind. I'm terribly disappointed because other than that I absolutely LOVE this keyboard. The touch is super smooth - and the blue lights make working in the dark downright fun.Thankfully I don't have to look at the keyboard much ;)"
5,Still Going Bright,"I've owned my Eclipse for four years as of Christmas 2010. It has survived four moves, two computer systems, lots of dust, sweat and debris. The lights are still as bright as the first power on. The keys have a distinct click as I type which I enjoy fully. Only a small patch of paint on the space bar has worn off, but after four years of gaming and general use, it's quite alright in my eyes.All in all, a wonderful keyboard which I will be sad to replace if and when it decides to die."
4,Great keyboard,I have used this keyboard for 2 years and am only now thinking of replacing it. The blue light on it looks really cool but is rather useless for typing in the dark. It seems to be there for mostly cosmetic reasons. As a gaming key board it rock solid. And performs well as a general keyboard. but lacks some media keys the big reason i want to replace it. It lacks some media keys such as the pause/ play key and skip next track keys. overall A very good value that i would easily recommend.
2,"It's OK, I guess......","Firstly, it doesn't have long enough rear pegs to make it stand up properly.Secondly, it has this blue glow that actually makes it much more difficult to read the keyboard in the dark(ness). It should have been white light, but that wouldn't have been cool, yes?Thirdly, this ""cool"" blue light comes on with every boot. It must be turned off every time. Charge me another buck and give me a switch.The pros that I am able to offer for this product is the fact that the keyboard has soft-touch keys that feel pretty good.I have gome back to my US$9 OEM keyboard and am much happier."
2,A cool keyboard while it lasted.,"I had this keyboard for about a year and I loved it. It is as cool looking as they say.Then about a month ago I had to throw it away. I am a college student and I was working on a research paper when it started typing keys I wasn't touching and then certain keys quit working at all. I had to use an old keyboard that the keys stick until I could get a new one.If you don't have $50 to throw away then I wouldn't recomend this keyboard. I am now using at $15 dell keyboard that is a little less cool looking, but does all the same things this one does at 1/3 the price."
4,Great Keyboard!,"I really like this keyboard. Good feel. Great looks. The blue backlight is great for late at nite with all the lights out. Would like the keyboard to be shorter - don't need a numeric keypad built in. Otherwise, this keyboard exceeded my high expectations."
5,Eclipse Keyboard,This keyboard is very easy to use. The light is a very good addition to this product. I can type in the dark and not disturb anyone in the house. Typing on the keyboard is effortless and the best I have used since starting school.
4,Well Built,This product is well built and works exactly how a nice keyboard should. It stays in the spot where you put it. It will take a ton of abuse. I haven;t spilled anything on it yet so I can't say how it handles that. The lighted keyboard is neat but the blue is too bright and at a strange angle to see in pitch black. It is hard for your eyes to focus on it but if you know your keys on the keyboard this will allow you to find them in the dark. The lack of ability to read the brgith blue is the only reason I give this product 4 rather than 5 stars.
5,Best Keyboard Ever!!!!,Hands down the best keyboard ever. Action on the keys is very smooth and solid. Back lighting on keys is easy to identify. It even has a mute button for your sound.
5,For the Late Night Gamer!,"This keyboard is awesome! The three settings of High, Low, and Off are perfect for any lighting situation. Now when the lights are off, either cause my wife and kids are sleeping or I'm playing F.E.A.R., there's no fumbling with the wrong keys. I have noticed that I keep the keyboard turned off most of the time. The contrast of black/non-lit characters on the silver keys is perfect for almost any light. But when I need it, man the blue lights are great."
2,Saitek keyboard,"Very disappointed, while it is lit the bluelight of the keys is darker than the background which is also lighted blue blue. This is used on a pull out desk tray--I can actually see the keys better with the backlight off."
2,Some weakness,"That is an old item for the saitek brand and I hope that they can correct some weakness of the product. I purchased this version because was a bargain price. The build quality is ok and the Backlight is amazingly well done, but the Keyboard lack some proper driver to work with my windows Xp. It kept finding New hardware over and over until I downloaded a driver for another Saitek keyboard. Then I had to workaround with the registry to make all the 4 added buttons work properly. Not really a plug and play device. And for a keyboard that's not acceptable"
2,Not The Real-Deal,I've used this keyboard for over a year and a half. I bought it for the backlighting and have been disappointed. They're just not bright enough in the dark. I find my self really having to squint when looking down from my bright monitor to find the keys I need.
1,Do not buy this keyboard,After only a few weeks the letters wear off the keys. There is no litature included with the keyboard. Customer service is practically non existant. Stay away.
2,Poor contrast due to reflections,"I was not happy with this keyboard for one reason...reflective paint on the keys. If the keyboard was used in a completely dark room, it would work great, but the light from my monitor reflects off of the keys, resulting in a very low contrast between the keys and the illuminated letters on the keys. The tops of the keys should have been painted with a matte, non-reflective black, so that the blue light shining through the letters would be more in contrast. In real life use, the visual ergonomics are very poor.I think this keyboard is a great concept, but it was poorly realized. The light from a monitor reflects off of the keys, creating almost a silver look which is very low contrast to the illumination color.I also purchased a small Zippy Illuminated keyboard which is much easier to read. However, the Zippy is only slightly larger than a laptop keyboard and I wanted a full size, so I ordered the Eclipse."
2,Could have been good..,"Well I bought this based on: it had a good layout, nice feel, and cool backlight.A few months later I discover that there is a fundamental flaw, however:Eventually, if you do not strike the keys precisely on-center, they have a tendency to ""get stuck"" on the mechanism underneath. This is quite frustrating, to be typing along, and suddenly come to a halt because you just bashed your finger on a key that isn't moving down.So, unfortunately, I am on the search for another keyboard already."
5,Accessory box,Had one for twenty years. I was surprised to find a new one after this amount of time. The longevity speaks for itself.
3,Very Good and worth buying.,"This book by William W. Johnstone is a very good one and was worth buying if u r a big fan of Smoke Jensen and all the books about him. The only complaint i have about the book is only because i have read all of his other books and i have a problem with the fact that in this book its talks about Smoke fighting in the Civil War which if u have read his first book ""The Last Mountain Man"" u would know that Smoke was to young to fight and his father and brother had gone to fight and he stayed home with his mother and sister. Other than that i would recomend this book to all fans of Smoke Jensen and William W. Johnstone."
1,"Trite, trite, trite","Alice Adams obviously labored to include all the 'hot' themes here -abortion, the homeless, revolting sex and drug use. All the themes are poorly and shallowly expressed. And, of course, there is the gay daughter and all the gay friends. If only Adams had written the story we were promised on the flyleaf."
2,Despicable Characters,"This is a very disappointing book. I'm sorry to have to say that because I am a fan of Alice Adams' writing.The most unsympathetic characters are despicable and the most endearing characters are self-involved ""trendy benevolents"" of ""privileged conscience"". I hope that Adams' true values are not the ones in this book.The novel has tinges of Gilchrist's contents while trying to aspire to be ""one of us"" or a ""good old gal"". Adam's 'one of us' is 'oh so not caring' and 'so not right'."
2,I would never recommend this book to anyone,"I bought this book at a Salvation army store for 50 cents under the pretense that it was a quality read that had no home. Well, I've learned that you truly get what you pay for!I, literally, had to put the book down at least 10 times before I could summon up the willpower to complete the reading. Not only were the characters 1-dimensional and underdeveloped, but they had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I found it hard to empathize with such self-righteous, self-indulgent characters. What eventually brought me back to the novel every time were the intense love triangles and sordid entanglement between the main characters. Even then, I was not pulling for any of the characters to succeed, really. I would even go so far as to say that I felt much contempt for many of the characters, including Caroline herself.If you do decide to read this book, prepare to feel nauseated and disappointed."
1,A truly dull novel,"A boring novel about boring waspy women in San Francisco who have no morals and no concern for anyone else besides themselves. These characters were predictable and dull. I hoped for something memorable to take away from this book, but I was left with nothing. I just hope that these characters are truly fictional and not based on real people. People like these characters are sad examples of humanity."
1,wrong item,They sent me a 1988 topps. WRONG PRODUCT. It would cost me more than the product is worth to ship it back. Guess I will just keep it.
2,"book lost my intrest, will lose yours too","I read the book in 4 months. A total boring story. It was really terrible, and shocking because LIZ IS SUPPOSE TO BE GOOD!! She turned out to be as naughty, let me refrain that NAUGHTIER then her sis. I am never, ever, again going to read the diaries. (Trust me this is a part of her life you don't want to know.) The regular books are fine. I read those in a day, I can't put them down. But this was a major DISAPOINTMENT."
3,not a good book,It was a stupid book I mean Liz is supposed to be nice and never cheat on todd but in all her diaries she cheats on Todd in the first one with ken matthews and in the third with sam woodruff
4,Instant Cappuccino in an Instant,"This instant cappuccino is terrific when you are in a hurry. I personally can use a little more coffee and less milk in the mix. I usually add a little more regular instant coffee to my cup. The hazelnut is very tasty. However, I have found out that it is great mixed with vanilla icecream and added to seltzer water. Ummm, good!."
1,not coffee,"I bought this stuff after Tasters Choice hazelnut coffee was taken off the market in the canister. This stuff is a can mostly of sugar ,three kinds, and coconut oils and a bunch of other unhappy things. At the end of a long list of ingredients coffee was last, just before natural and artifical flavor. But to add insult to insult the flavor is neither of hazelnut or coffee. I'd return it if the postage was not so high. I tried to contact the company from the phone number on the can and never recieved the promised call back so politely offered. It would have been helpfull to have had the ingredients posted with the offering."
4,Good value,I bought this for my 91 year old mother. She had been drinking International Hazelnut which costs much more. This is the only Hazelnut flavor I could find in a larger more economical package.
2,Too Sweet,"Someone had mentioned this tasted like gas station cappuccino. Now, I know what he/she means. It is sweet! The sweetness was the only thing that was bad about it. The powder mixed well. Tasted like hazelnut, etc.If you don't know about this product, DO NOT ORDER IT FROM AMAZON because you won't be able to return it. It is a food product and therefore cannot be returned. I love Amazon but I won't order unknown food items from it again. By the way, if anyone wants to buy this from me, look on Craigslist in Dallas."
1,Red Sox 3D logo cup review,"This product was a real disappointment. Upon arrival, there was nothing particularly 3D about it, only a black line on one side of the socks. Then we found that the sox logo was just an ordinary decal which started pealing off with the second washing. When I called the seller's customer service number, all I go was a machine. My request for a return call was never answered."
5,Mom who needed first reader books for her K.,"I ordered these books for my 5 year old daughter as a way to help her put the words she was learning into sentences. They were great. Each book in the series builds on the one before with a few new challenges. These remind me of the Dick and Jane books when I was a kid. It has helped her build her confidience and she is now trying to sound out things where before she would get too frustrated to even try. They work on some memorization and picture help, which is also part of beginning to read. I highly recommend these books to any child who is having trouble starting to read. They were great for my kindergartner."
5,Something I didn't know I needed. GREAT BOOKS!!!!,"I saw these books and figured they were too easy, but I was running into a problem. I could not get my little girl to read books. She was reading all of her lessons with little if any trouble, but when I would try to get her to read the same words in a book she wanted nothing to do with it. I set these books in front of her and she read all 12. They didn't help her to learn to read, but they were a great help in getting her to read and to enjoy reading.Update: I am now teaching my second child to read. I LOVE THESE BOOKS!!!! They are really helping her figure out how to read."
5,Bob books rock!,"This series of books has taught my 5 year old daughter to read! They are short ""books"", typically based on 3 or less new sounds. The sounds are introduced with pictures at the beginning of each book, then all words in the book contain only those sounds. Sound odd? Think... Mat sat. Dog sat. Dog sat on Mat. Basic, and so rewarding to the kids when they read! Each book builds on the previous, with plenty of practice built in, not just one new sound after another.I tried using these from the library, didn't work. They need to be returned too quickly, one series of these books may easily take a month or more to get through, depending on your child's rediness, retention, and desire to tackle reading."
4,Bob books are fun...,"The great thing about Bob Books is that my 4-year-old daughter is sounding out all of the words and is very proud of herself for reading a whole book all by herself. The only thing that I was a little disappointed about was that the books are small and paperback. It was neat, though, that a little finger-puppet theater was included inside the set of 12 books. We are having fun with that, too."
5,Our Son Loves These!!,"We got these for our son's fifth birthday. He had been working with some phonics cards for a while and knew most of the sounds. What we couldn't find, though, were books that were simple enough for him to practice the real reading. Most of the books just had too many different types of sounds and see-and-say words to allow him to practice.The Bob Books have taken all of that away! These books have one, at most two, short sentences on each page. Most of the sounds in the sentences fall within one or two vowel sounds. This has really taken away the overwhelm that he felt before looking at whole paragraphs in other children's books. Now that he feels confident that he can read, he is progressing quickly into more and more difficult material.Buy the Bob Books. I don't know ANYONE who has gotten them and been disappointed."
4,Yep! These are good ones.,"Once a child knows the basic letter sounds, he or she is ready for Bob books! I have 6 kids, and we homeschool. I used other books for my 2 oldest, but my son Alex began reading with Bob Books. He loves them!They are written at a perfect gradient, beginning with 3-letter, short vowel sound words. They are written just as I would have written them!I do wish the books were larger in size (not more pages, just bigger pages) and the pictures are just drawings - no color. An improvement of better, more colorful pictures and larger pages would get a 5-star vote from me.These are great tools, and I recommend them for every beginning reader."
5,Great for Beginning Readers,"We have been using this series for several months. My son loves the stories, they are appealing to little ones and I have been pleased with the gradual progression of the series. He is still in kindergarten and is moving rapidly through the last of the series. I recommend these books highly."
5,Wall's best yet,"This is a fine, complex novel by an outstandingly good writer. He deals with a whole variety of ideas including Western materialism, the collecting instinct and the function of the artist. I read this twice and will read it again soon."
4,vivid and poignant tale...............,"Robert Morgan recreates the tough life of the 1920's in the Carolina mountains. This is a tale of two brothers searching for the meaning and purpose in their lives. One brother Muir tries many different things, from preaching, to hunting, to building. Moody the older brother appears to be a callous, uncaring young man with a penchant for alcohol and trouble. Their mother attempts to let them lead their own lives but the clashes that are the result are heartbreaking for her. This is a great story of family and faith. Robert Morgan delivers the unique dialogue that breathes life into this tale of a poor mountain family. A delightful surprise is the appearance the main characters from his novel Gap Creek, which brings the feeling of familiarity to the story for those who have had the pleasure of reading that novel. Robert Morgan is a gifted Southern writer who spins a vivid and poignant narration of life for Ginny and her sons, Moody and Muir."
3,religious abyss overtakes story line,"I read _The Truest Pleasure_ knowing this was the sequel. It has usually been my experience that a sequel enhances the experience of most novels and feeling fondness for the characters of _The Truest Pleasure_, I wanted to know more about them.Unfortunately, I just felt the book slid into a religious abyss, sinking deeper into religious overtones that dominated the theme of the novel instead of enhancing the experience of the characters. I began to dread reading that a church gathering was happening as I had to read pages and pages of religious sermonizing that I felt had little to add to the story.The book could have been wonderful, as any child of Ginny and Tom would be worthy of carrying a major story line. Unfortunately, the fall out to monotonous sermonizing capitalized the novel and negatively impacted the tone of the book."
1,Major Rip Off,For the cost of a hard drive you can buy a SCSI jumper? These are available everywhere on dead drives. You would have to be really stupid to buy these. Not work even $1.
3,Ok series,"This is not earth shattering. The animation is OK. A bit of fan service but it's not to the point where you want to turn off the show. The premisses is interesting: main character is cursed by the cat God. To lift the curse, he must help cats or he will himself be turned into a cat (he is allergic to them). This show is a romantic comedy. The characters are mostly one dimensional (too many girls are introduced but the shortness of the show excludes any kind of character development).This could have been executed better. Packaging is cheap considering the cost of the item. The special features are non existent (a few previews and that's that). If Amazon starts streaming it, I would recommend watching it that way rather than purchasing it."
4,"Great little story, funny as all get out.","Again a bit of harem comedy with a great story. The main character, very allergic to cats, accidentally damages a cat god shrine in a moment of carelessness. Suddenly, he can understand every thing that cats say. The shrine 'cat' tells him he must help 100 cats or he will turn into one, and with his allergies, it would be a death sentence, so while his friends don't understand his new strange behavior, he diligently tries to fulfill his obligation. It is very funny."
3,Funny,"The series is pretty generic all in all. The protanganist is allergic to cats and somehow contracts a cat curse after beheading a cat shrine on accident. He suddenly has the ability to talk to cats and must do 100 good deeds to end the curse or become a cat himself. Being allergic to cats it will obviously kill him. If you are into the whole Harem type anime series and like a good laugh, this one is for you. His interaction with his love interest is probably the funniest in the series. I guess I really don't care much for him spitting every time he gets excited but I can live with that."
5,meditative and relaxing,The preludes are often reflective. On the whole this music sounds very much like Rachmaninoff and Scriabin. Some of it may also be patterned after Szymanowski's famous fellow countryman Chopin. Variation 7 is familiar-sounding and 12 is a wondrous classic. The Marzurkas are of a different genre sounding Bartokian or folk-song derived. The latter stuff on this disc is banal.
4,Loved It!,"This book was great! Although it didn't grab me as early as most of Warren's other books I have read, once it got going it was really great! She does such a great job of describing the ranch and life in Montana that it made me feel both like I was there and like I want to go there. And I especially liked that the main character isn't the typical perfect guy/night in shining armor that makes you look at your own husband afterwards and wonder why he can't be that great. Despite the realism of Nick, you can't help but love him and root for him. I definitely recommend it!"
4,Wonderful heart wrenching story of a hot cowboy meeting girl!,"This book engaged me from the first page to the end.Though the descriptions were not well developed and the life on west was not so much described in more details, the story was good and believable. The characters were real.By reading this story, you could fall for the hero.It is a heart pumping story at times with a few scenes that are heartbreaking. The growing love is wonderful.It is about hope, redemption, restitution, faith, and forgiveness. It is a great pick to warm your heart!I gave only four stars because after reading this book I did not learn much of anything. It did not uplift me spiritually. Also, the writer did not dig deep into the souls of her characters."
4,Great Story,This was a wonderful story with believable characters you truly were routing for. I enjoyed the character development.It is obvious that the author researches her topics and this makes the storyline that much more believable.Looking for to the next story in this series.
5,Perfect pump,These shoes are awesome! they look great with everything. you will not be sorry you bought them.
3,good teapot until it cracked,"I recieved this teapot for Christmas and have had it for about 10 months. The design is cute and the capacity was plenty for myself and my two daughters. I used the teapot at least one a week if not more. It was always hand washed and never put in the dishwasher. I was pleased with the teapot until today when I pouring hot water in it and heard a ""pop."" The teapot cracked from the bottom to about half way up! Needless to say I was very disappointed."
5,Thank you Amazon,bought this for my sister who chose this pattern before realizing how difficult it was to find. Thank you amazon for having so many products in this pattern.
5,Pretty and perfect size for tea,"When I opened the box yesterday I discovered a pretty tea pot, with a delicate ivy pattern, and beautiful swirls gracing the lower pot. The tea pot looks much prettier than pictured at Amazon.This morning I brought some water to a boil, addedCelestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Raspberry Zinger, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)tea bags to the pot, then poured in the boiling water. I covered the pot with its lid and waited. I was rewarded with a delightful cup of hot tea that poured nicely from the teapot spout.The teapot managed to keep the tea warm for sometime, especially after I wrapped the teapot with a clean tea towel, and I was reward with several cups of hot tea.I highly recommend this teapot based on its beauty and practicality."
5,Very Pretty! Matches my other Callaway pieces,"I only use this teapot as a decorative item but, I'm sure it would be very functional for brewing a great pot of tea because it's made of stoneware. You won't be disappointed with this sweet little teapot!"
1,don't waste your money on it,"The inner pot is not ""non-stick."" Everytime I used this rice cooker, I was sure that at least half of the rice were sticking on the buttom."
3,great book at ripoff prices,"Pose books are good quick desktop references but I recomend that you work from video, real war or war movies.You'll be able to develope more dynamic poses yourself.There's ton's of refereces on the web these day's.If you still want to buy this book get it [...]"
5,Great Biographical and Literary Study,"Zen master Eihei Dogen (1200-1253)has been widely acclaimed as Japan's finest religious writer. This is a major biographical study, cutting through the traditional hagiography that has clouded standard accounts of Dogen's life and writings. Heine does much to illuminate the rich and sometimes subtle contours of Dogen's intellectual and social context and the evolution of his mind. He also brings English-speaking readers up to date on the complexities of recent Japanese historical-critical scholarship on this pivotal figure in the Zen tradition. Dogen was a brilliant bridge builder who adapted the Chinese Ch'an Buddhist traditions to Japan to create what we now know as Zen. Heine highlights Dogen's many-sided literary genius, as well as the many-sided ways Dogen appealed to China as a way to craft his unique vision of Buddhist life. Lucid and insightful at a variety of levels."
5,Another gem from Steven Heine,"If you want to know about the life and Zen teachings of Eihei Dogen, all of Steven Heine's books are a must. Did Dogen go to China? Of course he did, but there is more to the story--much more.Steven Heine has once again dipped into the his massive reservoir of knowledge and come up with some very refreshing, insightful, and often surprising information on the life and teachings of Eihei Dogen.Did Dogen Go To China? Get this book and resolve this and many more important questions.Besides, just the pictures are worth the price of the book!"
5,Awesome Atlas!,"This is absolutely the most comprehensive atlas for Colorado that I have seen yet. If you aren't planning on leaving Denver or seeing what's off of the main highways, get a highway map from 7-11. Roads' details are excellent, showing topo info as well as ownership and management, with clear definitions of roadway maintainence (paved, gravel, dirt, ranch roads, trails, two-track, and highway). This atlas makes the DeLorme Gazetteer look like print-offs from mapquest.com. I tossed the Gazetteer when I found The Roads of Colorado. The DeLorme drops the detail for the entire eastern part of the state, which looses sightseeing and recreation opportunities in the southeastern section. The scale is fairly large, 1"" eqalling 2.5 miles, and is comparable to BLM maps in acuracy. A MUST for the adventure touring or dualsport motorcyclist, and will assist four wheel drive enthusiasts planning trips in Colorado. I, too, wish Shearer would do the same with their New Mexico atlas."
3,"This is the old version of ""Japanese, the Spoken Language""","This book was first published in 1962 and has been completely updated in the same author's ""Japanese, the Spoken Language"". I highly recommend that book and can't quite understand why this book is still in print."
2,God I hated this book.,"I was issued this and Reading Japanese for a college course in 1983. They use a contrived pronunciation system which only makes learning harder. Japanese has a standard way to Romanize syllables and it isn't possible to duplicate the system they use on a computer. I have met people who have had success with the book, but you need to have an instructor to really make any progress. I recommend Easy Japanese by Jack Stewart as a first book if you want to be self-taught. The companion book, Reading Japanese, is much more useful.When I went to Japan, I was often corrected on my vocabulary used in this book for it being archaic. ""Dictionary"" was one of the words they said was not current. That's kind of a glaring error! There is an odd obsession with ""furoshikis,"" which are not really used anymore.This is not a fun way to learn a language."
3,"Brilliant idea, but...","This is the most brilliant ""teach yourself Japanese"" book I've ever seen. A perfect read for all lazy people. Unfortunately, the author choosed to make up his own spelling of Japanese words and letters. Instead of official spelling of letters like ""chi"" and ""tsu"", the author writes ""ti"" and ""tu""! The book author would write ""tunami"" instead of ""tsunami"" and ""patinko"" instead of ""pachinko"". The book is very efficient if you are aware of these incredible mistakes."
1,What the?!?,"Why is this ancient artifact still on the market? I dropped a Japanese class after using this book for a couple weeks. No kanji or hiragana, this book consists of words, words, and more words crammed into each page with weird accents and intonation markers(not even a small picture). The method of transliteration in this book is inaccurate. How in the hell can anyone learn Japanese from this? Please look inside this book and see how lousy it is."
4,very cute,"Great little picture book. I read this to my class of adults with developmental disabilities, as part of a Psychology class on understanding themselves, their birth order, and sibling rivalry. They really enjoyed it."
3,Ok book for onlies,"Nice book that doesn't put too much emphasis on how only children are ""different"". The analogy is pretty weak though; ""do you want another dessert"" the mama bear asks the full only-child bear who answers ""no""! ""Why not, isn't more better"", ""no, one is enough"" , ""see, sometimes one is just enough"" to paraphrase."
1,Probably the Worst Work of This Genre I Have Ever Read,"This is not a great book although it can be used as a great illustration as to ""you should always write about what you know best."" In this case, I find it difficult to believe the author knows a thing of combat, World War II, history in general, making love or story telling. The story line is weak. The dialog is corny and the book is quite poorly researched. Even the ""cussing"" is forced and complete gratuitous - I doubt if the author ever listened to a GI talk. The book reads much like a Harlequin, a poorly written one at that. I would suggest the author stick to his empty Westerns. I cannot actually make enough negative comments to show my complete dislike and distain for this work. Jacket and in-book synopsis are quite misleading. I do wish I could give this one a less than one star rating."
1,Publisher's Weekly pretty much nailed this book,"It reads at about an 8th grade level. The characters are weak; the dialogue weak; the color and tone even weaker. Historical details are not even very good.If you want good historical fiction on the era, pick up Herman Wouk instead."
2,"Nice to have a kid book about Crohn's, but bad quality","It is exciting that there is a children's book about Crohn's. The author is a doctor with Crohn's, so the information in the book is factual and there are great notes preceding and following the story. However, the quality of this book is pretty poor. It is unrealistic. The whole subject of Crohn's get brought up because the mother serves her daughter a different snack than she does her daughter's friend. No child is going to believe that a mother would do that. Also, the way the children talk to each other isn't credible. The pictures are also not very well done, but I guess they get the job done. It is nice that children will have a book available to them about Crohn's but it is poor literature. I was disappointed. Children with Crohn's deserve a well written, well illustrated book, and I am still waiting for it."
3,pleasant background music with a Greek flavor,"Glykeria has a beautiful voice. I heard her for the first time on a compilation sing ""Piga se magisses."" That motivated me to get this album. This music is pretty, but it's not what I was after. If you like conventional Euro-American gentle pop sound this should appeal to you. I like a more Oriental sound in the Greek music so it wasn't quite what I sought."
3,"Good exposure for greyhound adoption, but not well-written","I appreciate that books like this exist since greyhound welfare is a cause close to my heart. But I just think it could have been done better. The story is very short and does not unfold smoothly. Buddi the greyhound wants to be adopted but his pride makes him desire more to race against a tough competitor. His new owner gives him up pretty easily to let him finish his racing career, only for him to realize that he would rather retire to a home. There is also a substory that interferes with the main plot, especially since the story is so short. Young kids probably won't notice that the story is lacking, so I guess it's okay as a starting point."
5,Fe,"This Cd is simply wonderful to listen to. I grew up listening to Roberto Carlos singing in Portuguese when my family and I would visit Portugal, and was delightfully suprized by him singing in Spanish. Fe, La Primera Vez, Lady Laura and Por Fin Manana are favourites."
5,WOW,"Wow, what a difference to stand on this mat to cook and wash dishes. It is soooo much easier on the knees and back."
2,Lasted a few months,These lasted a few months. Granted we're heavy users. But after one month these looked like rags. Not heavy duty at all. Would not buy again.
2,Not as good as the alternative,"I bought one of these and one Sublime Imprint mat. The only advantage of this one is that it's cheaper. In every other way, it's much worse, not as much padding, not enough to keep my feet comfortable through a whole day of work. I would not buy one these again."
3,Serves the purpose,"The pros: It seems to work; that is, it cushions underfoot, as it is supposed to.The cons: It has a rather industrial appearance, and I am not sure that it's 3/8"" thick as described. I thought of sending it back, but since I'd be out shipping costs both ways if I do that, I will probably end up keeping it."
3,battery,"received batteries, where packaged well,charged batteries as instrusted on proper time , batteries worked fine,thank you,grandson was very happy to have in toy"
4,Shadow of the Pomegranate,"Plaidy creates an incredible tale of deceit and trust. Katharine of Aragon meets and weds Henry the VIII of England and the two have what seems to be a marriage made in heaven. However, all is not as it seems. Will Katharine only be a pawn in the relations between her husband and her father who is the King of Spain? All of England and especially the King desperately await the birth of a healthy son from Katharine. As luck would have it Katharine suffers a series of miscarriages. Will she ever give birth to a son for her husband? Plaidy does an excellent job of keeping her readers in suspense. The character development is well done. Plaidy expertly displays both good and bad characteristics in all of her characters which allows the reader to relate. Well worth the read."
5,Incredible!,"After reading this book, I find it almost impossible to wait while I search for the out of print ones that came before it and after it. She really weaved this plot ingeniously and brought out the personality of Katharine of Aragon."
2,Please save me from Having to Finish this Book!,"I generally like Jean Plaidy's books. However, The Shadow of the Pomegranate, has become really tiresome and I can only make it about half the way through. This is the story of King Henry VIII and his first wife, Katharine of Aragon. It demonstrates the shallowness and self-centeredness of both Henry and Katharine. These small-minded individuals would not have made an impact on the world except for the families they were born into. Reading this book emphasizes why the divine right of kings is not a good thing. I recently read Katharine, The Virgin Widow by Plaidy. Therefore, I thought I would like this book. How wrong I was!"
5,Sirens,"Very scholarly work with an expansive bibliography. More info on sirens than mermaids, but covers both subjects thoroughly. Lots of illustrations. Very happy with purchase"
5,Perfect for Backyard,Item came very quickly and was easy to set up & take down. Net adjusts to volleyball or badminton height. Kids love it.
4,Keyboard & mouse product.,Terrific product so far. Set up and installation very simple and quick. Computer recognized hardware and I was using it immediately following loading cd. Mouse seems to require charging often. Not a big problem however with recharging dock that comes with product. Just have to remember to place mouse in dock. Seems to charge fairly fast. Satisfied with this purchase overall and price/quality=SATISFACTION=VALUE.
4,Worked well for me,"I got this product as a gift at my baby shower. It's not very attractive, but I didn't have a problem with the adhesive. My advice is to apply the padding well before your baby is old enough to pull up. My daughter never pulled the pads off, probably because they were always there and weren't something new. WARNING: Although I didn't have a problem with my child pulling it off, the cat that I got several months later did. If your cat likes to chew on foam rubber BEWARE."
1,"adhesive doesn't stick to edge, sticks to furniture","This fell off in about a day, it sticks so well to the furniture i can't get the adhesives off my entertainment center but it didn't stick to the guards at all. WHat a waste of money."
3,Mine stuck too well,"I had the opposite problem of so many other reviewers. I can't get the double-sided tape off the brick (maybe it's the kind of brick). Now I have a line of goo along the entire edge of the hearth. I think the product is the same as the jumbo corner guards, but this includes straight pieces, too. It worked great to keep my little one bump-free, but then she was the type that never really fell into anything anyway."
1,A piece of poop.,"I would rate this product with ZERO stars if I could. This product has got to be THE worst item I have bought since my baby was born. I followed the directions of installation to the tee, and it didn't last on my hearth a month. My 10-month-old has already pulled it off. Basically, anything that goes on with adhesive tape will be pulled off by the average baby. Lesson learned. If it worked well, I wouldn't mind the fact that it is a real eyesore on my living room. Unfortunately, it is an eyesore that has no practical function, and I have wasted my money."
1,don't waste your money,I bought this for our fireplace -- gee fireplace on the picture. I cleaned the surface and then lo and behold these pads have tape on them to hold them to BRICK??? I used books to help the tape stick and the foam fell off in a couple of weeks. Even before the twins learned to crawl over and pull it off. Oh and by the way I wouldn't stick this on my furniture either. It is going in the trash.
2,Not Safe Enough,"I like the concept of this product. It is very cushiony and easy to install. BUT, my toddler pulled it off the same day. We finally used a super glue like material to get it to stick. Now we only have to re-apply it once a week instead of several times each day."
2,Pretty much sucks.,"We ended up giving this away. The stickers it comes with is a joke. We went with another brand (just one long piece) and it worked out much better since our brick fireplace is rounded. If you do go with this one, make sure to get the removable caulk as the stickers don't work AT ALL."
1,Don't buy there's no point,"An expensive product that doesn't even work. Like many other reviewers I felt the adhesive does a poor job of staying onto a brick fireplace. My 18 month old is constantly pulling off and I have to put back on, so there's no real point for this product. Also there isn't enough cushion provided to cover the edges of my fireplace. I had to buy two boxes, an expensive investment that I'll end up replacing"
1,Not strong enough,"While I loved how thick and cushioned this product was, the double backing tape was not strong enough to adhere to my brick fireplace and stand up to my daughter pulling on it. I ended up using another product that uses double backing velcro which she thus far has not been able to remove."
2,Fuctional ?,"Well, if my 10 mth old baby couldn't rip these off the brick hearth, I'd be much more pleased with this product. They look good and blend in with my brick so much so that most guests don't even notice them. The concept is great but functionality is very questionable. Maybe the manufacturer should consider stronger adhesive."
1,point of purchase being...???,"We put the guard on...following directions, cleaning and all, and what happened? Half of it fell of, and the rest of it was pulled off by my daughter! If its supposed to keep my baby safe, then how come she pulled it right off? This product was a complete waste of money, and I couldn't return it or get my money back because it says ""may not stick to all surfaces"". What kind of customer service is that?"
2,Busy Baby's Mom,"The concept is great, but the product isn't. The pads have a lot of cushioning, but they don't stay on the hearth (we have a brick hearth). My son constantly pulls them off - the adhesive needs to be improved greatly."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"I wish I read the reviews on this product before I bought it. My 11 month old daughter also loves to pull off the foam. Not only did I waste money but I wasted a lot of time purchasing, installing and running over to my daughter hoping she doesn't pull a piece off and choke on it.If I could rate this product with 0 stars, I would.Update 12/07 - my son who is now almost 3 had the same issues with this product. The glue has left such a mess on our fireplace and I'm still trying to get the glue off. HORRIBLE PRODUCT."
3,Not Perfect But Does Help,"I got this when our daughter started walking. The crawling never concerned me too much as she never seemed to be an ""unstable"" crawler. Once she was on her feet I was a bit concerned about our hearth which is slate not brick. This does stick to the slate pretty well and stays adheared until she rips it off. Once it has been taken off once it does not stick back on very well, you have to use another adhesive strip. After a while she was pulling them off more than leaving them on so we just gave up. But by that point she was beyond the ""crash into everything stage"". My sister in-law had less luck with hers but she has a brick hearth and had a 2 year old and twin babies so the three of them pulling at it was a losing battle. It did help us for the few months that we needed it and I am sure well use it again with our baby who is due next month."
1,They might help if they would actually stick!,"We got these becasue our new house has a brick fireplace with an elevated ledge. Our daughter was just learning to walk when we moved in and as part of our baby-proofing we decided we needed something for the fireplace. This was about the only option BRU had and it was a waste of money. It didn't fit together right and then the adhesive didn't stick to the brick. Plus when it was on our daughter seemed to be drawn to it! It never failed she wanted to go right to it and try to get it up. So we just took it up and she's been fine without anything on it. In fact, she's pretty much left it alone since we took this off."
4,Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard,"I think it's worth the purchase. Target had these for much more money. So far, it's stayed on and where it is attached is made out of cement. I didn't have to use extra adhesive and my son already pulled one piece off, it went back on and stayed there (2 months now). When you cut them to size, I suggest scissors. The directions say use a serated knife but it just made a mess. Good luck."
2,"Wouldnt stay stuck, made a huge mess and looked horrable","This is worth it for the safety but Im going to warn that it dose NOT work on rock fire places. They only way I could get it to stick to the fire place was with gorilla glue and then still, it would fall off. Now its off completley it it was hard to get most of that glue off, my fire place looked like it had dung clung to it.Too bad it didnt work for me."
4,"Functional, but not pretty","I also purchased the bumper for my table, made by the same company. The only difference is width of the bumpers. The Fireplace bumper is a lot wider, but same thickness. The bumpers stick very well and don't fall off. My son likes to stand up and sit down a lot near the brick base of the fireplace and he is constantly bumping hi knees against it. It works great and cushions his knee every time. I give it a 4 instead of 5 stars because it would be nice if there was an option for other colors. Other than that, great product."
1,Not worth the price!,"I find that this item is terrible. Yeah it may protect them from their precious heads, but they have more fun pulling it off! They aren't sticky at all, so they don't hold good. I just don't think it worth the money or the hassles and trouble."
1,This product does not work!,"This product was not only expensive, it does not work! My son constantly pulls off the pieces. The pieces are too short in the kit and he is able to get a grip on them and rip them right off.They should make the strips longer and provide a better adhesive. I plan to write a letter and complain to the company. Don't waste your money please!"
1,Please Don't Buy It!,I wish this product would work. It doesn't. The pieces are easily pulled off by my twins. I ended up buying a kidco gate to go around the fireplace...I should have used this money to go toward that option in the first place. I really think it is the only thing that would work with most kids (maybe some kids aren't interested in pulling/playing with everything but mine are).
1,Doesn't Work,"This doesn't work with any fireplace except for brick. I have a stone fireplace and it was awful, the worst! I had to return it! It should say on the box that it only works for brick, so I'm assuming since I don't have a brick fireplace."
4,Like it.,Easy to cut to custom fit your fireplace. They do not stick very well to the brick so my husband attached the pieces with double stick tape.
1,Doesn't play nice with real brick,"It is cushiony, but it really doesn't stick to a real brick fireplace. It's extremely easy to pull off (i.e. bad for crawling babies), and looks uneven when applied, since it sticks to all of the bricks differently. Not a fantastic product, since the goal is to stick to the edges well."
2,Pricey for what you get.,"These guards are a bit pricey for what you're getting. The adhesive that comes with it is a joke. With a surface as porous as brick, there's simply no way it will work (the box it comes in even shows a ceramic hearth so maybe that's what it's intended for). My husband bought some heavy-traffic carpet adhesive and that has worked pretty well. Our little one can still pull the foam guards off if he wants too, but the carpet adhesive is so sticky that they reapply with no problem. Also, we were disappointed that the pieces don't fit together better. There are obvious seams across the front so it's not the most attractive look. However, they do serve their purpose."
1,Useless!,I'd give this zero stars if it were an option. Not only did this guard not adhere well to the edge of my brick fireplace - but my baby became fascinated with pulling at it. The little guy managed to get it loose with little effort and once loose - it never adhered again!
4,It works,"Does what it's supposed to do. It actually does stick to the bricks, which I was skeptical about. We have very long fireplace so we were short by just one piece. Rather than buying a whole other kit, we contacted the company directly and were able to purchase just one piece for $6 including shipping."
4,Better than others.,I first got this brand and I felt it stuck well but was quite expensive. I have a large fireplace and I needed aditional cushions so I got the Parents Magazine Safety One and it was horrible compared to this one. I Haven't tried to remove it from my brick fireplace yet but my daughter has pulled the other brand off but this one is still in place. It's worth the extra money.
2,Destiny to its Highest,"This book is about a sixteen year old boy who wants to become a Native American. He would wear moccasins to school, had a Dakota pipe, would grow his hair long and die it black, he would also try to make his skin darker. Charley Black Crow was his Native American name and would sometimes sign his papers with that name. Floyd believed it was his destiny to become a Dakota Native American. He had a dream which showed him as a warrior. Floyd put it to heart after his dream to become a Native American.Dakota Dream was not an exciting book. There were no parts where you just couldn't set the book down. It was very boring. The same tone was used throughout the whole story. Native American ways were used throughout the book, and I did learn a little. You also learn how life was in a foster home.If you know your destiny this is a book for you. It will help you on the way to find your destiny. This book shows what one boy did for his. Now what will you do for yours?"
4,"good, but weak points also","Dakota Dream by James Bennett held my interest throughout the book. That is not to say that I agreed with all the characterization or plot movement thought the book, however. The main character, Floyd Rayfield, is sometimes too weird to be believeable. And the adult supporting characters all seem to be portrayed in a negative light. Despite these critical points, the book had many redeeming areas."
3,how can he say that?,"I believe that this book was written just to put people like me off, I mean, really, what was this guy thinking? He must have been off on another planet when he was writing this one. But for a good laugh, I'd say it's all right!"
5,And I've just seen the cover!,"Seeing the cover of this book during the time I've started my first bargello quilted jacket has captured my imagination. Bargello quilting is amazingly easy, and SO MUCH FUN! It gets the creative juices flowing! I've yet to find this particular volume, but the cover shows a beautiful story to draw me completely in."
2,Same Old Thing,"This is another fast paced police win in the end book that proves a sledgehammer is mightier then a good pen when it comes to having a story one needs to think about. This is an overall entertaining book that moves fast and does not weight the reader down with things like messy sub plots or details like character development. It is fast and has action, there is just not a lot of thinking required past a fourth grade reading level to get through this book."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The first bed was delivered and was missing components and had chipped paint, so I returned it and another one was ordered. When the second bed arrived (well-used and scuffed up from obvious previous use), the frame would not assembly correctly no matter what I tried. I have a doctorate in mechanical/structural engineering, so let me assure you that I know what I'm talking about when I say that this bed is ridiculously constructed. Amazon has been great about returns and their customer service has been extraordinary, but DON'T BUY THIS BED!!!"
2,bed frame only,I just bought this bed frame and it just arrived. I am not to happy that the posting was so misleading. I was thinking it came with a mattress when it didnt. I think i am going to send it back. Change your posting title so no one else gets this idea as well.
4,Linden Queen Bed with Frame,"This is a great bed- simple, elegant and very sturdy. It is also a great value. The bed arrived earlier than promised, had all the parts, and was very simple to assemble. It looks great in my bedroom. The style works well with a wide variety of decors. I am very happy with the bed, the look, and most especially, the quick service from Amazon."
1,I'll never know if this was a good bed...,"Frame was missing the center bar and five other small parts. amazon required both packages be returned and would not negotiate to just get a new frame to me. Frame manufacturer also would not work with me because it was not directly purchased from them. amazon says they will pay for return postage, but they made me pay it upfront and it was a couple hundred dollars. Not a fun experience this time."
5,An inspiring compilation of amazing thinkers in aciton!,"This will inspire you to create more, aim higher, get together with others who want to get things done, and go do it! This DVD is a well-crafted window into the world of high-energy collaboration of some of the world's most successful people. I have already given away a half dozen copies to my friends and colleagues."
2,No Thinking Required,"We will encounter some of the brightest minds and freshest thinking and reduce them to 30 second sound bites and fill the bulk of the movie with meaningless, self promoting drivel from the current TED director and the adventures of the host as she gets coffee and goes to the beach.Save your money and watch the presentations for free from the TED website."
5,Inspirational!,"This is the most inspirational movie I have seen in a long time. It impacts you both intellectually and emotionally. Five stars, absolutely, worth every penn for the education and fun!"
2,I am a huge TED fan--BUT this movie is very dated---not worth it,I am a huge TED fan--BUT this movie is very dated---I believe it is a 2006 TED conference.Product not worth it
3,All about scientific names,This is a great book---if you are looking for a listing of scientific names...I didn't know this when I bought it..and was surprised to find out that there was no way to really identify birds....it all about the scientific names.Nicely made book however.........and I do suggested this book to those looking for that list of scientific names !
3,Uneven outing for Faith,"This twofer, with over 70 minutes of music, provides a showcase for Faith-penned tunes and some lesser known hits from Hollywood. The Love Goddess finds the Faith arrangements full of his trademark strings, but several hits are distinctive in that Faith employs the brassiness of a big band sound, especially on Cheesecake. Keystone Kapers, with whistles and bells, is forgetful, but other selections are an easy listen. Hollywood's Great Themes contains selections that certainly would not make anyone's list of great themes from Hollywood. Would you pick the love theme from Ben Hur, or the theme from Light in the Piazza, or how about Over and Over Again from Jumbo? The only real Hollywood classic here is Moon River, though Faith does add a smattering of Richard Rodgers, with Hart and Hammerstein."
4,One More Great Percy Faith Twofer by Collectables,"Two big qualities distinguish the late Percy Faith.First of all he was an original arranger with all those strings combined as if in a brass section in a unique sound. Second of all, he was a staff arranger for Columbia Records what gave him the opportunity to work on memorable albums by Johnny Mathis and other singers.This twofer shows two different approaches: the first 12 takes came from his splendid album 'The Love Godessess' full of Mr. Faith's own compositions for films and TV series like 'The Virginian'. They're such inspired songs like the title song and 'Celia's Waltz'.The second 12 takes came from another album with a miscellaneous movie soundtrack repertoire. They're such great songs by great composers but Mr. Faith's arrangements do not add any special flavor to the originals.A special note on Collectables Records regarding its extraordinary series of twofers which have finally issued virtually all Percy Faith material."
2,An Okay Read,"I thought the book was okay. I live in the town where this all took place, and the details that were incorrect -- completely verifiable details like the name of our newspaper -- leaves me a bit credulous as to the rest of it. Overall, it is generally a good book in terms of covering what happened, but when the little details that can be tracked down are wrong (store names as another example), it makes me wonder how much else is conjecture and not verified."
2,Not worth the time...,"I didn't like this book at all. It was incredibly boring and didn't give much detail about the killer. I wanted to know about his family, his childhood and HIM.This book was more about the prostitutes and their drug habits than it was about the actual crime itself. I don't reccomend at all."
3,Memorable but Forgettable at times!,"I read this book a long time ago. I remember about a man in upstate New YOrk who was a killer. This book is memorable but mostly forgettable because they become blended into the true crime genre of literature of time. I have read hundreds of true crime books and sometimes they are just too alike. While crime particularly murder is never identical twice, this book is like so many others. It's vague and doesn't hold or have the same punch in the stomach. It's not that shocking anymore."
5,One of the most likeable books I've read in years!,"Inventive, insightful, instructive, inspiring and funny. Filling the Glass is a surprisingly effective and effecting book. One minute you're laughing out loud, the next you're nodding your head in agreement, the next you just have to pause to let a powerful point sink in. As the author acknowledges, many of the strategies are novel and few are familiar, things we know to be true but which we probably haven't really made part of our lives yet. As promised, he provides great new insights even into the familiar strategies and, more importantly, practical tips for incorporating them into your career and/or your life."
3,VERY compact dish rack,"My only real complaint about this dishrack (which is mostly my fault for not checking out the measurements) is that it is SO small. it really is only good for plates and some silverware. there is no good place to put glasses or mugs, or even bowls... if it had been maybe only an inch or two wider, that would have helped. On the good side, it does look good and doesn't show any signs of rust or wear. i guess it would be good if you already have a dishwasher, and just want something portable for in-between washings."
2,Cup Rack?,"Although it fits nicely in the area I had planned and it's trim in appearance, it does seem flimsy. In everyday use I get the distinct impression that a misplaced plate would tip the thing end-over.The big problem I have with it -- although my own fault because it's obvious from the picture -- drinkware doesn't have a place on the drying rack. Glasses and mugs either hang unsteadily over the sides and drain water onto the counter or they take up virtually all the room on the rack. Who washes dishes and silverware, but not drinkware?Again, my own fault, but if you drink beverages like we do at our house, heads up."
3,stainless dish rack,I am enjoying this product...I don't have a double sink and I hate dishes on the counter (no dishwasher either)..it fits perfectly in the sink next to a plastic bin..so my sink is more functional and when I get a dishwasher it will be handy for just those few items you don't want to put in the dishwasher..looks nice too!
2,Really small,"I had a very large dish drainer and wanted a smaller one made out of stainless steel. This one is called ""compact"" and when I got it I knew why. Much too small for even a medium size counter. And kind of ""tinny"", the stainless steel is very thin. There is really no room for things other than plates; glasses, cups and bowls won't fit unless they are drained alone.Again, it is very small and functions only as a plate drainer."
2,Poor craftsmanship,"Overall, I was not impressed with this dish rack. I liked the look and the size of it, but it did not appear to be stainless steel, which is how it was described in the listing, and the craftsmanship of the utensil basket in particular was really poor. I ended up returning it for a refund."
1,Not suitable for use in water,"As noted in other reviews, the basket doesn't appear to be stainless steel. It rusts! Entire tray and basket poorly made. Cheap Chinese crap."
1,Too Compact,The item on line appears to be larger than what was received. There is no place for glasses or coffee cups.
1,trash,"This is item is really small. it only fits small dishes, a couple of cup and so on. I was going to get a refund , but thats ok, im getting something bigger soon."
2,Great if you only need it for a short while or don't get it wet,"The is a great compact dish rack that holds more than you would think, as others have noted. The big problem is that the utensil basket will begin to rust rather quickly and will be unusable within several months. We use the dishwasher for most items, but even with limited use, we've had to stop using this rack because the rust was so bad.So if you only need to use it for a couple months, or if you can somehow keep the utensil basket dry (kind of defeats the purpose), then this is a good item for you. Otherwise, keep looking."
1,Useless,"This item is completely useless. Sure you can put some plates in it, but if you want to put a regular drinking glass, coffee cup, or bowl in it, forget it. It is so narrow that you cannot stand a glass in it. Also, it feels like it's going to topple over if you only have 1 or 2 plates in it unless you position them toward the center."
2,Doesn't look as good as the picture,"My product clear had not had the soldering painted over, and had a bunch of burn marks. Even so, it still doesn't look as nice and shiny as the picture does. I think it's a perfect size, but I wasn't impressed."
1,Not Satisfied,"I have this Stainless Steel Dish Rack with utensil holder, and it is ""rusting"" all over. Please advise what I can do about this.Thank youMadeline Futerer"
4,Mini Dish Drainer,"Great little product. Would have preferred it if the tray that it sits on was designed for the water to drain off into the sink, if used on drain board. I am using inside my sink, so that is NOT an issue, however, I found rubber suction cups helpful to stabilize rack and prevent any rust forming on my stainless steel sink. I think they should have been included. Plate slats should have been made deeper . . . you must place them exactly right, or they too, will topple. Rack is not quite as heavy as I was expecting . . . utensil rack is a bit flimsy. A tall spoon can make it top-heavy and it will topple over."
1,Polder Compact Stainless Steel Dish Rack,"Terrible product. Rusted within weeks. Not meant to be used with water. More suited for use at a cook out; e.g., to hold silverware and plates."
3,"Looks like a nice product, but check your plate size","I chose this item from its appearance and compact size, and did not think that its grills would not accommodate my larger size plates with lips for which I intended to use it. It doesn't. I will be returning the product with regret because it otherwise was exactly what I was looking for. Consider your plate size before choosing this otherwise pleasant appearing and practical item."
4,Space saver,"This dish rack is a perfect in a kitchen where a dishwasher is used for most things, and is short on counter space. I run the dishwasher every 2 or 3 days, and handwash a few items that I use daily. My counter space is small, and this dish rack leaves enough room for me to use for food prep. The only drawback is that it's a little tipsy because it's so narrow."
4,quite decent..,"i have only had it for a week or so but i am happy with it. i live in sf, and my apt is small so i needed something small to hold my dishes. this did the trick..you can fit a few mugs on it or cups if you don't have a ton of bowls plates to wash. not ideal for a 'family' but for a single person i don't know why one might need more space unless you are cooking for a group or something...anyway, i have not had it long enough to comment on the 'rust' aspects of it -- but if it does i will update this review. so far, very pleased with it."
3,Polder Dish Rack,"Item does not rust as stated, I had another brand that did not last a year due to rusting. However, everthing seems to dump over when you use the dish rack side. For that reason I would not recommend it."
3,Not great for the Money I spend,It is fitting into the space I have. But it is getting rusted pretty quickly.
3,Only strainer I could find to fit my asymmetrical sink,"Bought this rack with the hopes that it would fit in the small side of my asymmetrical sink. Well it does, but it IS pretty small. I can make it work by tilting the dishes half on the rack and half on the bottom of the sink/wall of sink. First started by using the metal base, as the rack slides about a bit on the bottom of my sink, but it quickly started to rust when water was sitting in it. Have thought about buying a rubber mat to place under it but so far the strainer is adequate without it. The silverware holder works well, although, occasionally it tips sideways if heavy utensils are placed in it- just need to counterbalance it with another piece of silverware."
3,good SMALL dish drain,"this is a small dish drain. I bought it to sit in the sink, but it seems to take up too much room for that purpose. It is so small that sitting it next to the sink isn't a big deal. It does hold a few dishes, and the stainless steel design is modern appearing."
4,Compact dish rack,"We purchased a curved black swanstone kitchen sink. One of the bowls are overlarge, the other small. We found this item and fits perfectly in the small side of the sink. A well made drainer that holds quite a bit considering it's small size. We may still need to purchase a protective mat for the bottom of the sink since the metal legs sit on the sink base and are not wanting scratches."
3,"Didn't work for me, but it might for you",Pros: attractive and compact sizeCons: the divider pieces did not hold my large dinner platesI ended up returning it because of the one con. Consider what you need it for and how small it is - might be fine for you.
3,Nice product - a little steep though,"I like the look of this dish rack. I chose it because it's narrow and doesn't take up the whole counter-top. Also, I like that it's metal rather than plastic. The dish rack holds a surprising number of plates and utensils for its size. As others noted, it doesn't work for heavy pots and pans and it's not ideal for for cups and mugs... but it COULD be. You can actually fit two rows of cups on each side of the rack snugly. Place a drying pad underneath the tray - voila! It's good for cups.This product is fine for a single person and that's about it. On the 4th week or so it got a tiny rust spot, which I wiped off. It also collects a light calcium stain from my 'city water'. Therefore, I wipe it dry every couple of days. It's holding up pretty well but I would feel better if I'd bought it in Downtown for $16.00. All in all, a-ok."
3,functional,"I guess that I should have measured my very small counter space,,,this is nice looking , but does'nt hold many dishes at all. Plates it could hold a good amount , but not enough space for cups or bowls,it will only hold one coffee mug and one tall glass at a time,,it is better for plates and saucers only ,,and a few pieces of silverware."
2,Rust,"I am on my second rack and in the process of sending this one back. The rack rusts at all the welds. I called the manufacturer who said the rack is rust-resistant, not rust-proof. I wish I could find the same design in plastic. So disappointed!"
4,Great Product!,"This tub is really nice. The contoured area for the baby is just right, and it seems really safe. My baby hated baths until I bought this tub, and now he is much happier. I like this tub, but I agree with other reviewers that the drain is slow. Also, the hard plastic is unpleasant for the baby, so I also bought the Safer Bather cushion. I realize now, though, that I really didn't need that...a soft washcloth or cloth diaper would be enough. I recommend this tub to anyone who wants to have good control of the bathing situation. I feel much more at ease using this than I did using the sink because I know that my son is not going to slip into the water."
4,Everything you could ask for...except for the size...,"I bought this tub based on all the reviews I read about it. I purchased it when my son was already a year old because he was getting to big for his smaller tub. My son loves to play in it and I feel that he is safe while bathing. The only drawback to it is that it is enormous. It is hard to store away without taking up too much space. Otherwise, the bath tub does its job and it is easy to clean."
4,So far so good...,"We've used this to good success, starting when our baby was 4 weeks. We have yet to try the other side for toddlers. It puts him at a comfortable angle and while it doesn't seem like he enjoys the bath, he's content and doesn't fuss, and never feels scared or uncomfortable. It's a little tricky to get his backside; use a towel on the bottom of the tub to keep the him from sliding around.Tub is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to drain. Unfortunately you can't use it on the counter so you have to bend over the bath tub ledge. Unrelated to this product, I recommend installing a detachable hand held shower head for easy rinsing of baby and tub.Be careful not to set anything on the ledge that might knock onto baby's head (like a tall shampoo bottle).It's a big tub; I imagine storage will be inconvenient if we save it for another baby."
5,AWESOME TUB,"This is the best tub, definitely worth the money. I have a three year old that has probblems keeping his balance when sitting. This tub is perfect, it came a little bit more than half way up his back and it has a triangle in the middle that keeps him from sliding forward, but its not too close that it crushes him. Also he has about eight inches from his feet to the other end of the tub. Tons of room to grow. He is 38"" tall. I would recomend this item for every parent it is awesome."
5,WONDERFUL TUB!!!,"We searched everywhere for a safe tub once our son outgrew his infant tub (at 3 mos). This tub is FANTASTIC, he fit right in the little landscaped grooves and was very secure. He is 13 mos old now and still sits inside the grooved part of the tub. He is so secure in there that both of my hands are free to wash his hair, splash and play with him. This is a fabulous product,and although it is a bit large, I can't recommend it highly enough!!!"
5,THE BEST OUT THERE,"The best tub ever. Our daughter loves taking a bath. She laughs, giggles, splashes and kicks when taking a bath. I never knew that babies can enjoy bathtime so much. She does not even mind when I wash her hair or her face. The tub is like a little baby spa. Seriously, the most comfortable thing out there. It is also very safe, the baby is cradled just right. The size might be a problem for a small apartment, but if you tie an elastic or string in the hole, you can hang it on the door. It's worth every penny, I would pay even more money for this tub."
5,Baby Bath,"Great bath tub, very versatile. Goes from baby to toddler. We have had it since she was born and we still use the ""baby"" side to wash her hair and then switch her over to the ""child"" side so she can play and have fun. It's big and takes up room in the tub but it doesn't really matter and I wouldn't want any other tub. It's perfect!"
4,excellent product,"I read reviews before I bought it. It has very good reviews. After I bought it, I agree with all of them. Excellent bath tub, only problem I have is that this is so big it cannot fit on small sinks. I don't think it is a huge problem."
5,Worth every penny!,"This is by far the best purchase we've made for our son - at 2 months old he was 16 lbs, and too big for most tubs. This one is perfect. He absolutely LOVES it - he kicks and splashes and has so much fun in the bath! It's very supportive, but at the same time, he has a lot of freedom to play. Our 7 month old nephew took a bath in it the other night, and he loved it as well. He sat up where my son lies, and also had support and freedom at the same time. It's too large for our kitchen cabinet, but it works well inside a bathtub. I would absolutely recommend it to any and every parent and/or grandparent. Just be ready with your video camera the first time you put your child in it!"
5,Best tub I've seen!,My son loved this tub! I bought it based on reviews I read and now I recommend it to all my friends. The contoured design really supported him when he was little but the plastic gave him the freedom to move his arms and legs. He kicked and splashed and had all kinds of fun! A definite must have!
5,LOVE IT!,This is a great tub. It keeps the baby in place so you can use two hands to bath him. My son has a wonderful time kicking and splashing in this tub. It is a bit big for a new born so I got a small tub for the first two months. I will be able to use this tub for a while. It is a must have in my book.
5,Can't be without it,"This is the best tub -- a must have. We were recently on vacation and had to buy a cheap very plain and simple tub and our 4 month old was so unhappy. The Eurobath really allows him to feel secure with the ""cradle"" features. It is wonderful the fact that he can splash with his arms and kick with his feet all while he is nestled between the side barriers and the barrier under his bum. Yes-- we still have to watch him continuously but he is not going anywhere. He is simply out of control with all of the splashing he does in the tub. We have had him in it since he was 2 weeks old and he has loved every bath. I can not say enough good things about this tub. It is a big tub, so I guess we just get to grow into it and love every bath that we get to take."
2,Too large for a newborn,"After reading oodles of positive reviews I was excited to use this tub for my newborns but they are just now able to fit into it at 3 months (11 lbs). The center divide was much too wide for their little legs to surround(my boy cried because it was crushing his boy parts) and their arms could not fall over the arm rests. As it is, it's so slick, I have to use a hand to hold them in place or they'll slide around and fall out of position. I don't like this tub at all and wish I had bought something smaller. I thought I was being frugal by buying something that would be usable for 2 years. I've used it twice and I'm ready to chuck it!"
5,A+ Tub all the way!,"I am not one to write reviews but I just had too for this tub. We had the 4 stage tub first and the baby didn't fit in it anymore at 2 1/2 mo. besides that we needed two people to bath her, one to hold her and one to bath her. This tub is perfect, it cradles the baby so you don't have to hold them and keeps both hands free to do the washing."
5,The one and only,"This is the best bath you could find!!! It is very safe and comfortable bath for your child and you! I love how it holds your child in place! All I have been doing is putting a towel in the bath so my son lies on a soft surface while takin a bath. I feel very comfortable bathing Paul, without any help from my husband. It is bigger and takes up more space then this other baths you could find, however this one by fare deserves you attention and space! The price is very reasonable for something you could use for a while!"
2,Too Large,"I love the tub; however, it's HUGE! We had no where to store it. It barely fit in our bath tub when we were not using it. It's as big as a laundry basket. I would have rather gotten a smaller one because once my son was sitting up, he bathed in the sink and our tub. So after 6 months we didn't use it any longer."
3,Great Tub BUT BEWARE,"This is a great bath tub, I don't think their is another tub that compares to it. The only draw back is that it is hard to store because of the size, but the size is one of my favorite things about this tub. I gave it only 3 stars because you need to be aware that the shipping and handeling charge on this item is as much as the tub itself, so it ends up being very costly. There is also no Customer Service phone number only an e-mail address, so i feel the Customer Service could be much better. BEWARE!"
5,perfect for infant,"We started using it when my daughter was newly born. at first we put a sponge foam on top to give her the soft support. not sure if it's necessary though, it's just my idea. when she reached 2 month, we removed sponge foam. now my daughter is 7 month, we're stil using it. the size fits her very well throughout the 7 months. she seems very comfy sitting in there and always has a wonderful time at bathing time. it's also very durable, easy to clean. after 7 month's use, it still looks like new! my daughter is at 97% height. from what it looks, we can continue using this one until she can sit in the big real tub by herself! definitly a good buy!"
3,It's okay,"I like this tub, but it's huge and it's hard to keep a newborn in place when washing. I might use this more when my son gets a little older."
5,You gotta have one!,"My daughter is almost 8 mos old and i bought the Euro tub this week. At 20 lbs and 27 inches tall I thought we would need to use the side for older babies, but the infant side of the tub fits her just fine. She lounged in there immediately becoming happy and content to kick and splash while comfortably lying back! She was able to stay nice and warm because of the depth of this tub, without any fear that she would slip, so i didn't have to rush to get the bath done. When I was ready to take her out, i just switched her to the older child side and washed her back, rinsed her off and we were done! What a difference from the Snug Tub i tried first. She was always tipping over to one side and i was afraid she would slide under the water if I let go of her for a second. I highly recommend this tub - it's worth every penny for the security it gives you and your child!"
5,MOST AMAZING BABY/TODDLER TUB EVER!,"This tub is amazing because it goes from newborn to toddler and saves you from having to keep your bathtub super clean for bathtime! This tub fits perfectly in our bathtub and has a lot of play space for our son, yet keeps him from slipping with the molding between his legs. Such a time saver to not have to worry about keeping the tub ready for bathtime, too!"
5,The Absolutely best bathtub!,"After trying six or seven other bathtubs, I am absolutely convinced that this is the best. It lets the parent easily bathe an infant without holding him or her with one hand - it is equipped to hold it for you!!! It is durable and accommodates infants and toddlers. It is light and large enough at the same time. This is the only bathtub you need for your baby (well, except for the large one)!"
2,Tub is too big,"I chose this tub based on the reviews I read here. Granted that I had a preemie, but she is 5 months old and 12 pounds and the tub is still way too big for her. The molded plastic seat doesn't hold her right and she doesn't feel secure. I used my friend's tub last week and my daughter loved that one. I don't know the brand, but it had a mash sling to hold smaller babies that you remove when the child gets bigger.Also, this tub is very large overall and is hard to store."
1,Waste of Money,"After reading all the reveiw on this, I believed I HAD to have this tub. It is bulky and a pain to use. Our daughter never liked it. Buy the sponge - it is a couple of bucks and really all you need, in my opinion.We just sold it in our garage sale - I think we probably used it about 3-4 times before we gave up because of the hassle."
1,TOO BIG!!,"I ordered this tub based on the positive reviews. However, the tub is WAY TOO BIG!. You might as well use your own bathtub because the euro bath is the same size. By the time you fill it, clean it and find a place to store it (if you can) you wont ever want to bathe your kid again."
3,just one question.,"I am in the process of registering a bath tub for my baby due in 2 months. I have a double kitchen sink, and I want to know if this one will fit a double sink.Anyone out there help me out?thx"
1,Outrageous shipping charges!,I won't buy this tub because they are trying to charge $21 for shipping. The item itself is only $24.99. You can order larger and heavier items with less shipping charges. Did all of you actual pay that ridiculous amount???
5,The perfect baby bathtub,"No frills, sheer elegance in design! Love this bathtub. I was looking for a simple plastic design so that the tub would be easy to clean/sanitize with no mold issues. The closest highly rated blue whale tubFisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub(like most others), while really cute, has a tendency to develop mold in hidden crevices. The PRIEuro has no crevices. I have been using this since LO was 2 weeks old. She is 4 months now and still loves it. It is quite big in size but we have ample counter space on the vanity so it works well for us. Looking forward to using this until LO is a toddler!"
4,it looks good,"I like how the product got here on time and its exactly like the picture, I thought it would be nice for it to have a mattress or cushin material and its lacking that,,,I guess I have to get that separately to make it comfortable for the baby."
5,A must have tub!,I bought this tub after reading all the positive reviews. I have been bathing my baby in it since she was 4 weeks old. She loves the water and this tub allows her to kick and splash while safely keeping her head out of the water. The other end of the tub will be used when she is able to sit on her own. The con about this tub is it is large but I have found that it fits nicely under the baby's crib and is obscured by the crib skirt.
4,great tub,"My twin girls were born 4 weeks early and they weighed 4.5 lbs each, and so I used a smaller tub (some other brand) until they were about 6 months old, when they began splashing the water about so much and wetting up the walls and bathroom floor. I pulled out the Euro tub that my friend gave me, and I never looked back. My girls loved sitting in this spacious tub and they still used their hands and splashed water, until I gave them some plastic animals to play with. They would fuss when I take them out -- they enjoyed their baths so much. Anyway, I found this bathtub especially useful when one of my girls developed a touch of eczema and I would sprinkle some Aveeno Oatmeal bath powder in the bathwater and let her sit for 10 min. It is much easier to clean a plastic tub than the real bathtub in the bathroom. My girls are 22 months old now, and I have retired this tub, but I think the time that I used it, I found it an essential item."
4,Great Tub!,"Regardless of the larger tub that I would have chosen for my registry, my experienced mother friends all told me, no matter what baby tub you select for your registry, purchase the ""new infant lawnchair style sling"" that you place into a kitchen sink for baby's first bathes anyway (found at Kmart or Walmart). I read the reviews on this site and chose this tub for later on because they were so much better than the reviews for any other tub. Anyway, I finally received the Eurobath at my shower and it was a lot bigger than I expected! When my baby got turned 2 mos., I finally moved her into the Eurobath to see how she would fit. I must admit, I'm now very happy with this purchase! This is a great bath for her now and one for her to have in many coming months. She gets very serious about her bathtime and will just kick those little legs as fast as she can!!!"
4,Great Tub!,"This tub is huge. Only gripe is that my baby was so little (5.5lbs and 18"") that I think this tub is still too big for her. Bigger than any tub I've seen at any store. My cousin that has a big 8 month old is jealous and can't find a tub as big either. Hopefully this helps!"
5,The pond of them all,"Hello, this is a must have tub. Who cares about how big it is. Your baby will love this tub forever and have loads of fun in it. There is only 1 small detail i have about it. That is the middle part seems to hurt my son down in between his legs. But, other then that i can't seem to get my froggy (our son) out of his pond. He just loves bath time. He has tons of fun in it and by the look of our bathroom floor and mommy you can see. It looks like i took the tubby more them him. LOL. I wish this tub was made 6 years ago those other tubs don't beat out this one.To all the new and old parents this is a MUST HAVE product. My froggy loves his pond."
5,Happy Bathing Baby,My baby is 3 mo old and likes to kick and squirm when in the tub. The PRIMO bath tub is fantastic with it's moldings. He can kick and splash and I can bathe him without fear of him slipping under the water. With this tub you are able to fill water a little fuller than regular tubs so your baby stays warm. It is the best bath tub for babies.
4,We enjoy this tub!,"We chose this tub because of the molded infant side and the big toddler side. We started using this tub when our son was three weeks old, and he just seemed so small in the tub. A few weeks later, he flipped out of my husband's hands and landed face down in the tub, so we discontinued use of the tub until he was about 4 months old.Now that he's older, he loves it! While lying in the infant side, he had the freedom to splash around, and I never have had a problem with him rolling over or anything- the sides help keep him from doing that.He's now 7 months old, and we've switched him to the other side of the tub. He loves it, and the middle core keeps him from sliding around too much.The biggest setback with this tub is it is huge. We keep it in the tub of our spare bathroom, and it takes up most of the tub. The drain is also inadequate- it is much easier to just pick it up and dump all the water out."
5,Best Baby Bathtub,"This tub is worth every penny! It is large, but I keep it under the crib where it's out of the way and easily accessed. The best thing about this tub is how it holds a small baby in place while you bathe him or her. My baby is 4 weeks old but I'm sure I'll continue to like it as he grows."
1,Way too big!,Registered for this for our baby and when it came I was shocked at how VERY LARGE it was. Certainly it would be a pain to store when not in use. Sent it back.
1,Size Matters...,"I bought this bath tub for my baby because it said it could be used for older babies, which is just what I needed, as the home where I live doesn't have a tub or shower, and I didn't want to just sponge bathe my baby when he got older (I want him to enjoy an actual bath).This tub is TOO big.It's too big to fit in a sink.It's too big to fit on a bathroom counter.It's too big to fit on a kitchen counter.It takes up too much room on the floor-- and then lifting it to drain it is too much work.I couldn't use this tub.It is only made for someone with a huge home."
2,Tub is too bulky - takes up half of the bathroom!,"I bought this tub because it received really good reviews - but it is gigantic and really takes up half of my bathroom.Also, because of it's size you don't transport it and end up keeping it in the bathtub anyway!I found it's just easier for my daughter to take a bath with me!"
2,waste of money,"Even though it is supposed to be designed to grow with your child, this tub is just too big for a newborn and unnecessary for a toddler. There is no mechanism to secure a newborn in the tub. My daughter just slips and slides around. Also, it is just an enormous tub that doesn't store well. You might as well pad an adult tub. I wish I had gotten another tub."
2,Seems to be very good but it was useless for us,"We always thought a baby needs a big space during the bath to relax. When my nephew;s parents registered, they found this one and got it. It seems to be the biggest one out there and it works for every stage in your child's development.When he was born, his mom decided that he was too small for this tub and decided to use the kitchen sink. We expected he would be able to use it when he grew a bit.At three months he outgrew the sink and they tried the tub. That was the only time it was used. They prefferd to hold the baby with one arm so he could moved however he wanted, without being limited by the tub. It just wasn't comfortable.They have a big, spacious bathtub in their bathroom and, at 5 months, my nephew loves to lay there by himself splashing and ""swimming"".But we still hope to use this one when he gets a bit older and can sits well by himself... so we don't need to use that much water :)."
3,huge and no space to store it,"We bought this because of all the positive reviews, but clearly we should have spent more time looking at the less than stellar reviews. I just opened this and it's a behemoth. On what planet can you hang this on the back of a door? If you have ANY STORAGE space issues at all, this is not the tub for you. You couldn't hang this anywhere in your living space without it being on the way somehow. It's very deep so I just can't see how you could put it behind a door (except perhaps a door to a basement). We've to return it because there is just no room in our condo to store it."
2,Too hard!,"My husband registered for, and we recieved this bath when our daughter was born. From day one, I absolutely hated it. My daughter was born 7lbs 15oz and 20"" long - She constantly was sliding around in this thing, or when she would kick and splash her legs would go around the ""post"" that was supposed to separate her legs and it would hit her privates hard. She just could not relax enough to enjoy her bath, and she LOVES to be in warm water.Even with a sponge support she cried every second she was in the water. A towel, sponge support, anything at all that might help A) make her not slip around so much and B)make it not so hard. Once we switched to a softer material tub by Summer Infant (I might also add that the tub is MUCH smaller!) my daughter loves bath time again. She will kick and splash, play with toys, etc.I would not recommend this bath tub. It's a good idea, but the material is just too dang hard and it's not comfortable for little babies."
5,Best Tub Ever!!!!!!!,"We read the previous reviews before purchasing this tub, they were very helpful. This is the best tub ever! We first thought it might be too big, but it's size has not been a problem at all! We have used it since the day we brought our daughter home and she is now 9 months and sitting nicely in the seat area. The reclining feature is perfect and very safe. I can use 2 hands to wash my daughter and not worry about her going under. We put it right into the bathtub to use it, very handy. This tub stores great under our baby's crib! One minor drawback - this tub does not travel well to grandma's house."
4,Works well for our special needs daughter,We bought this bath tub after a recommendation from another special needs mommy. Our daughter can sit but in the bath tub she likes to slide down all the way. With this tub we have stopped that from happening as it has a stopper between the legs to prevent her from sliding. Our daughter loves bath time and i'm so glad we'll be able to use this for a couple of years before having to buy expensive special needs bath chairs.
5,Finally - A happy bather!,"This is my first Amazon product review, but I wanted to share my joy now that my little one finally enjoys bath time. Before getting this tub, bath time was not a happy time in our house. Now that we have the EuroBath, our three month old smiles and even chuckles while we bathe her. She has room to splash and play, but we feel confident that she is safe and secure (obviously we wouldn't leave her alone though). The molded shape of the tub is perfect for a baby that cannot hold her head up for extended periods of time and it looks like there is plenty of growing room. I really like the fact that there are no parts or hidden crevices where mold can grow."
5,Very good tub!,"I bought this tub after reviewing almost all the other comparable tubs on here! My son was 5 months old when I bought it, and he is now 14 months... it works great for us! He is just starting to outgrow the small side (and he is very long for his age), so we just switch him to the other side or put him in the big bathtub if we wish. I love that this tub is BPA free, and it cleans/dries very well. It is large, but has plenty of room for your child as he/she grows. One of my most useful buys!"
3,It really is gigantic,"Despite the fact that this tub gets great reviews, my husband and I had to return it simply because we had no where to keep it in our small home that has limited closet space. It is nearly the size of a standard bath tub and would have taken up a giant portion of floor space in our closet when not in use. I can see why so many parents love it - it does look like a baby spa and has great ""nooks and crannies"" for baby - but, for us, we did feel that the inconvenient size was not worth the potential benefits that many reviewers have stated. Everyone knows how much baby gear your house starts getting loaded up with - we felt this was one of those things that our baby could live without."
2,BABY SLIPS!,"I bought this because of all of the great reviews, but no one addressed the issue that the baby slips down when they are using the angled infant side of the tub. Most baby tubs have some sort of padding or rubber mat on the infant part to prevent any slippage, but this one is just slippery plastic. So I was having to hold her and wash her at the same time. I do like the other aspects of this tub, so I have not replaced it yet. Currently I just use a towel underneath her and that seems to be working well."
2,It's too big,"This bath tub is humongous. It needs its own bath room. Too big to put it on top of a kitchen sink. Since the only place I found for it near water source is inside our bath tub, which places it practically at ground level, my back is killing me.Unless your are planning to remodel your bathroom to fit this monster, go for something else. Definitely not for a 700 Sqr Foot apartment in the city."
5,Absolutely the safest and the best!!!!,"The Eurobath is excellent!! I have to say, it is a little large and difficult to negotiate when travelling, but it is definitely well worth it...it is sturdy, and the baby fits so securely that it makes bathtime more enjoyable for both you and the baby! Since my daughter is very petite, I was actually able to use this almost right up until the manufacturer's suggested age of 2. And the most important thing besides the safety of the product is how sanitary it is...you can empty it and wipe it dry in 2 minutes! The shape and size make it easier for transition into the adult bathrub when baby is ready. I am looking forward to using this again for my next baby, due in 3 1/2 months! It's so sturdy it's in the same condition as when we first used it. Excellent product!"
4,"A safe, water-saving tub","One end of this tub, designed for infants, was only OK for use with our baby as he tended to slip down into and around the crotch-stopper too much, so we used a smaller tub instead. The other end of the tub, designed for older kids, is great, and will see continued use. The tub is easy to clean, safer than a hard adult tub, and saves water VS filling an adult tub.Two downsides:1) Filling it may be a problem for some people with a bath spout too close to the wall, as ours is, as you need to lift the edge of the tub up to reach it, and then back down when heavy with water.2) Finding space to store it may be a problem in tight spaces."
4,My daughter has LOVED this since her first bath!!!,"I highly recommend this bath. Although it is a bit larger than other baths out there, the big size ensures the baby is comfortable and there is enough water in the tub to keep them warm. My daughter has felt secure in the bath and enjoys it, I'm sure it's in part due to the tub. I would suggest that if you buy the tub, you add a towel or soft sponge to the reclining section of the tub, we use the bear-shaped sponges that sell @ BabiesRUs for $5."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this tub!",This is perhaps the BEST purchase that we made for our son and is the one item that I attribute to him truly enjoying his baths. I love that the shape of the tub holds a child securely while still providing a lot of room for playing and wiggling.My son is 19 months old and is still using this tub.
5,Love my tub!,I love this tub...and so does my baby. We have been using since the first real bath and I love that it keeps my baby nice and safe and that I can use both my hands to wash her or to splash around with her (she is now 12 weeks). No matter how exited she gets she does not slip and we can all enjoy bath time without worry. Right now we keep it up on the bathroom sink so that mom does not have to bend over the tub; and it fits perfectly on the double vanity.
5,Easy to Use; Easy to Clean,"This tub is perfect for use in a bathtub for babies and toddlers.It is a solid plastic piece, so it wipes clean and can be easily bleached.It has a plug in the bottom that even after 6 months use with 2 children it still seals well.The infant side seems to be a bit uncomfy as my baby kept trying to roll out, but it could have been his age at the time (4 months).Now at 10 months(24lbs) he is very happy sitting and playing in the other side.It is also a good size for when my small(26lbs) 4 year old wants to take a bath.I was disappointed that it arrived kind of beaten up. Had we not just moved I would have asked for an exchange. It was almost $40 when I bought it and dented in many places and the box was busted open on arrival. However it does still work despite the damages."
4,Nice roomy tub.,"I don't use the drain feature, so that doesn't bother me (other people have said it's hard to drain.) I love that it's roomy and has a couple different options for seating. I lay my kiddo down to bathe him but allow him to sit up to play. Actually, he can switch himself between the different seating options now (he's 8 months), which worries me a little, that he's that mobile in the tub, but hey, I'm right there watching, so I guess it doesn't matter much, and it entertains him to move around and chase toys around the tub."
5,Great Baby Tub!,"This tub has worked since day one for my little Olympic swimmer. It holds her right in place. It's large, but light and can be hung on the wall. I searched long for this and even returned a cheesy cutsie one cause it was not thought out well and full of synthetics (not in my babies bath!) I wouldn't recommend any other bath to my friends..."
5,Loved it,My baby and I loved this tub. It held him up perfectly so that he could enjoy the bath. I used this item for both of my baby boys.
1,"had a crack, many dents and too many stains.","Looked very bad. Very poor quality plastic. Felt bad to see the sticker ""Made in USA"". There was a crack in the product, doesn't look like damaged while shipping. Felt like sellers are using amazon to clear of defective product."
1,waste of money!,"We used this tub twice before it started leaking! water flooded out the plug hole and all over the kitchen counter. We thought maybe the plug wasn't secured so we tried it again next bath time, same thing!It's now going in the trash (try shipping this huge monstrosity back!) where it belongs.Shame, because I really like the concept. My son also slips around in there, and the middle part meant to secure him just makes him uncomfortable."
3,beware that it's real new or not.!!,"product is good, but it look like already been used..., so better watch out it's real new or not....so PS"
1,gets dirty real easy and quickly!,"It does get dirty very easy. after a week of use, you will find that the tub has black streaks on it and it's extrememly difficult to remove them. We've decided to ditch it and buy another brand instead.Also, it is just too huge....too many extra stuff in the tub. After using it, we figured out we just want something simple...just need a tub, no need to have anything inside!"
5,Highly recommend this tub.,"I bought this tub...I am so glad I did. I believe our son loves the bath because it offers him the chance to really be covered in water. Also, because of contouring, I am not in fear of him drowning. It is near impossible for him to go under. I can't wait for him to graduate to the ""deep end.""Oh, a hint--I use it on the bathroom counter next to the sink. It takes about 5 water pitchers to fill it up enough."
5,Euro bathtub by Primo,"The tub came so fast and the shipping was only $5.00, I was planning to buy this same tub from Babies R Us but it was going to cost me $50.00. The tub was $24.00 and shipping was $26.00. That was craziness. This bathtub came within 2 days in great condition and it has been well used. Thanks!As for the tub, I love that it is so deep. I can give my baby a bath without getting water all over the floor (unless she is splashing) it has two sides to it, one for infants and the other for toddlers, She'll be able to use this tub until she is two. Also there is a Safer Bather pillow that can be used on the infant side that keeps them from laying on the hard cold plastic, it is sold separately but I would say definitely buy it. I've used other bath tubs when visiting family and friends and I'm so glad I have this one. I bought one for a friend as a baby shower gift and she equally loves as much as I."
5,Aweome product!!,This tub is wonderful!! I tried other tubs and they were such a hasle. This one is wonderful as I don't have to support my daughters back and head like with the other tubs. She loves it also!!!
4,Good to buy,"It's good and safe if you always put water under the maximum level, but not perfect. 'cause the surface is hard, You have to put some towel to comfort your baby. In addition, you have to also use a temperature tester to make sure the water temperature are just right for you baby. Anyway, in a short word, it's good to buy."
3,"Good for bigger baby, but not newborn","This is in my baby shower list due to the high rating of this product. I agree with most of the reviewers that this is a good product BUT not for newborn baby. Since the size is pretty large, for a newborn, especially in the winter, if you just put little water and with the large surface area, water cold up pretty quickly! So, we ended up bought a smaller size one for our newborn and only use this product after my kid reaches around 6 months."
4,Love it but it's NOT for newborns,"My husband and I love this tub. So roomy and it's very clean/sleek looking! Our son was very cramped in his smaller tub at just 4 months of age! His toes would reach the end of the tub! My son is in the 90 percentile for his height & 60 percentile in weight.Now the reason why I gave it 4 stars: It is not ideal for newborns because it doesn't come with a hammock. From 0-4 months, the smaller tub was great for our son. It also allowed us to bathe our son standing up because the smaller tub fits on top of the kitchen sink. This tub does not. If you have a smaller baby, I don't recommend this for your newborn! In my opinion this is more ideal for babies who are 14lbs and up!"
5,It was very safe and comfortable,"I saw a lot of reviews about this product on amazon and decided to get it. My baby is now 14 months old, I have used it since day one I brought her home from hospital. I feel so safe when I put her in and hold on to one of her arm when I turned to side to get her toy or shampoo. I know she won't slip because of the design, just never leave your baby in the bath tub alone. I am glad I bought it and since it is big enough, I don't have to worry her out grow it."
4,Great tub (with only one suggestion),"This is a wonderful bathtub for baby! I have been using it with the Safer Bather since my son was first able to have baths. The only suggestion that I have for this tub is that they should put a rubber or sponge padding in it. When I put my son in it for the first time without the Safer Bather, he slipped all over the place and didn't like it (he was 3 months old at the time). There's just no traction in it once you put the water in it. So I ""downsized"" from the Safer Bather and bought a sponge pad. that I now use in it and he doesn't slide around anymore and can enjoy splashing around a bit (which he couldn't do with the Safer Bather). He has always enjoyed his bathtime, but I know I would enjoy it more too if I didn't have to worry that he was going to slide around in it so much!"
5,the best baby tub,"my 4 month old son has been in this tub since he was 1 month old and LOVES it! he yells when I take him out. it is safe and cozy too. he loves to kick and splash, and when he gets a little older, he can switch to the other side of the tub. i highly recommend this tub!!!"
5,Don't know of a better tub out there!,"I truly don't believe that there is another tub out there that is as safe, versatile, and functional. The raised sections that fit under the baby's arms make it so easy to bathe them when they can't sit up. So many other tubs are just too small. This one allows the baby to be immersed as little or as much as you want which helps keep him or her warm and makes it easy to rinse him or her off. The design also allows them to have fun splashing and kicking around within the first couple months! It's plenty big enough to bathe a two year old in and uses so much less water than filling up your regular bathtub which saves you money. The one down part is that in order to be so versatile, it is rather big and depending on your place, can be difficult to put away. But, I still think it's worth it. Don't waste your money on any other tub!"
5,Great for larger babies!,"Our son had outgrown his infant tub. He was arching his back and kicking his feet, and basically did not fit. At 4 months he was already 17 pounds. I finally bought this when he was 5 months old, and he LOVES taking baths in it. I wish I had bought it earlier! He can kick at will, and he fits v. nicely. He is now 8 months old, and still fits v. well. It doesnt take too long to fill if you just use the tub faucet (not shower head). We also bought a hook, and it stores nicely on wall in shower. Highly recommend this for next step tub!!"
5,I wish I had bought this sooner,"This tub is the best- I wish I had bought it sooner. We had a 4 stage tub for our son, but he got really big and it didn't fit any more. I saw this tub listed in Baby Bargains (great book!) and decided to try it. I never used it for my son when he was an infant, but you can put the baby in one way and they recline, then face them the other way once they can sit up.This thing is fabulous! My son has a ton of room to splash around and play. In fact, now he hates to get out of the tub since has so much fun in there. The tub also has a spot to hold shampoo and bath wash bottles."
5,"huge, but wildly useful!","Make no mistake, this is a BIG tub and not something you can store under the sink when not in use. However, we are super happy with it!! My son is 2 years 9 months (and a tall kid!) and STILL likes bathing in it! It definitely saves water (versus filling up the big tub) and if he's happy, who am I to complain? Highly recommended--just be sure to clean the tube that runs from the top to the tub. I wasn't careful at first and it got mildew/mold! Yuck!"
5,LOVE IT!,"This was one of the best purchases we've made! Our 9 week old loves baths in this tub. He's very comfortable in it since it cradles him & I love the idea that it can be used for so long. We purchased it directly at the store which I see was wise since shipping can be so expensive.It is very big compared to the other tubs out there, but we just store it in our bathtub when it's not in use."
4,Looks durable,"Looks good and seems like my baby is going to be comfortable in it. However, I should have checked the measurements well as it's rather too bulky to fit in my regular sized kitchen sink. But overall I'm happy with the product."
3,This thing is GIANT!,"It ended up being more of a hassle to use this then just jump in the bath with her. Plus I had more control over her in the bath versus struggling with this giant thing. She kept sliding down, even when we used a towel under her. I used it a couple times, now a year later it sits in our closet."
3,What's the hype?,"Dunno, I had this tub, and it was monstrous. I hated it for my newborn, probably used it twice, then put it away till she was around a year and could use the situp side. I could see getting excited about it for older infant/toddler. I felt secure turning my back on her because she was well supported. There is no easy storage solution for this behemoth; the thing basically lived in one of our bathtubs. It didnt't survive for my second, not that I would have really used it if it had. I think it fell from a shelf and the bottom cracked. So not that durable in the end either. There are better ways to bathe an infant. I loved the leachco safer batherLeachco Safer Bather - Infant Bath Pad - Blue Fish. Euro tub was not for me."
2,Does not work as well for us - read to know why !,I had high hopes for this product after reading all the glowing reviews.This is why it does not work for us -1) Our tall (86 percentile) 7 month old fits rather uncomfortably on the side for babies 6 month and older. The protrusion to keep the baby slipping is real close to her body and she has to sit really upright and in no other position. A bit more recline is needed and the protrusion needs to be less wide.2) Our baby is always trying to stand up - and the shiny and highly slippery surface means she falls down hard. A well designed product would have a non-slip surface!3) The drain hole is tiny - takes a long time for water to drain out.Cheap - and highly over-rated. I'm looking for alternatives.
3,Too Slippery,We bought the Eurobath after reading all the great reviews and knowing our son could still use it as her grew bigger. What we found was that our son is so squimy and active in the tub that he doesn't stay in the moulded recline. The base of the tub is too slippery for an active baby like ours. We end up holding him throughout bathtime. So think twice if you have an active child who won't sit still!
4,Great Bathtub... but valve leaks,"This is the best infant bathtub. We had a different tub that we used when our baby was smaller-- but we outgrew it within 4 months. This tub works great, plenty of room (allowing baby to stretch out and still be ""in"" the water, unlike the other tub we used) and has support now that our baby can sit up. The only problem we encountered was the valve leaked the 1st times we used it. This was a problem since we were using the tub on a counter. After using it several times the valve does not leak anymore?? Overall I would highly recommend this product."
4,Primo,"Great product, little bulky to store. I use a towel to lay down the baby. It is a little slippery when you are trying to wash the babies back. Buy some rubber stickies to put down at the bottom, that may help."
5,I LOVE this tub!!!!!,"This tub is fabulous! You MUST get this!!! I just purchased this for my 6-month old daughter, who was getting too big for the 4-in-one tub in the reclined position. Also, for the entire time I used the 4-in-one tub, my daughter would keep slipping down and I would have to readjust her. She did not look comfortable. With the primo tub, all that is avoided. I don't have to constantly readjust her and can wash her much easier. She is definitely more comfortable now and can splash and move around safely. I can't speak to how a newborn does in this tub, but she fits great. And my 2-year old loves using the tub too. This is really such a great value because you will get so much use out of it. Highly recommended. I wish I had this earlier."
5,Will be able to use for a long time,"This bath is great. It is safe for infants and toddlers, although an infant needs some help, because their heads are still floppy. The built in drain is very convenient and you can hang it on a towel bar."
5,Buy it...... Worth it!!!,"I had received another tub for a shower gift that i hated!! So i went online to read reviews on some tubs and thought that i would give this one a try. I absolutely love it. It works great when they are small so they wont slip at ALL! Then you can still use it when they can sit up because it has a side for that too! It is large like everyone said it would be but it fits in my tub and mine is small, then i just store it in there too. Worth the money! Buy it... you will love it."
2,Not For Active Infants,"My 7 months gets too active during bathtime so I bought this to replace myFisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub. It is bigger which is great but it is also very slippery for an active infant. My infant would crawl or tried to stand up causing her to slipped hitting her body and head into the safety supports which are hard plastic mounds. Bathing became difficult and painful for her so I stopped using it and got something with a flat even surface like aHoppop Bato Bath Tub, Limewhich worked out quite nicely. I would only used this if my infant just lay during bath like a newborn but she doesn't. I would also recommend getting some anti slip stickers if you're still going to get this. Will give it another try once she can stand on her own."
4,Great tub!,"I love this tub! My one month old loves it too. I purchased this tub based on several reviews about babies loving it. I think my baby loves his bath time because he is able to sit in a good portion of water, so he doesn't get cold. The only thing I don't like about it is that there is no cushion/padding for him. He's so small that he somewhat falls to the side, but I have been putting a towel down first for him to sit on, which helps a great deal. Regardless, it is a great tub, and worth it."
5,Taken back at first but I LOVE IT,I registered for this tub on line and when I received it I was put off by it's size. I was set on returning it till I realized that it fit perfectly on the bottom shelf of the changing table. Then I gave it a shot and I LOVE IT! The bottom support that rests between my son's legs works perfectly and is very comfortable for him. The side supports hold his upper body in place. I lay a hand towel underneath him for cushion and leave a little to hang over the crotch support and fold it back over him so he doesn't go pee and spray us both. Despite how secure he is I do not take my eyes off of him even for a minute and I make sure I have everything I need in hands reach including the cordless phone before our bathtime adventure begins! WE love bath time!
5,Eurobath,"My baby is one month old and we love the eurobath! It's spacious and comfortable, he likes being in the water, other bathtubs have a seat out of the water. It also has a plug on the bottom which makes it easy to empty. I love that it holds an older baby too."
4,Love this baby tub!!,This tub does the job but it is BIG and hard to store. Baby is now 14 months and still loves it. Worth the $
5,A versatile tub,"We got this tub soon after our son was born.We begun on the ""lay down"" side. Soon after birth, the plastic shape was a bit too large, and our son was slipping around. We fixed that by putting a towel in to secure him better. When he was about 3-4 months old, we got rid of the towel.Today, he is almost 11 months old, and we put him on the sitting end. We end up filling the tub beyond the recommended water level, but that does not seem to cause any problem.Pros: the tub is spacious, and it works for at least 2 years. You can put two babies in there, which has been useful when our son's cousin visits.Cons: the tub is rather big, and may not be suitable for very small spaces."
5,holds my infant in place!,"I like that it holds my infant in place. He can't hold his head up and with my old bathtub, his head kept falling to the side. With this plastic material, I like to run warm water on it to warm it up for my baby before putting him in there. Otherwise he will fuss because it's too cold. He is 2 months old now and his arms barely fit over the infant walls that hold his body in place. I use one of those rubbery shelf liners to put under the baby tub to hold it in place in the regular bath tub, but I think it will be fine on a regular bath mat. Overall I like the tub very much."
5,Best tub for baby/toddler,"I had read several reviews on baby gear, and knew I wanted this tub. It's a bit long (probably 4 ft long), but it's worth it. It's setup for a newborn baby on one side and a baby that can sit up on the other end of the tub. It's great. As soon as his umbilical cord fell off, we had my newborn in it, and he loves it. I would recommend a non-skid pad underneath (like the rubber shelf liner that you can get anywhere). Love this tub - it's light, easy to carry, has storage spots, and is easy to drain. We use it right on the counter top.."
4,Good But Buy Used,"This is a great product. Easy to clean, safe, comfortable. My 15-month old still uses it happily. The only problem I see is that it is a huge piece of plastic and it would be better for the planet if more people bought them second-hand."
5,This tub is the BEST!,We switched to this tub when our daughter was four months old and wish we would have done it sooner. She stays in position and is very comfortable and kicks and plays while getting her bath. There is a lot of room so we should get plenty of use out of this tub. BUY this tub and you will be glad you did.
5,Great to grow on!!!!,"With my little (big now) one 10 yrs ago, I remember all of the slippin and slidin and chasing them around the tub! Well, this one puts the little darlin' right in her place, so there's more time for fun! This tub is wonderful, it makes the baby secure so that bathtime is so much more pleasurable! It's really worth every penny!"
5,Great tub!,I received this as a gift. I didn't use it until my daughter was 5 months. It's wonderful! While you would never leave a child unattended - it does provide a great deal of support. I have a hard time getting my daughter out of the bath - she just loves being in there! I highly recommend this item!
5,Grows with your baby!,"My baby is 15 months old and we still use this tub. It uses much less water than the regular tub, and she still has plenty of room to sit and splash around. It totally saves my back being able to put the bath on the counter. It worked well when she was a newborn too. No worries about not being able to keep a slippery newborn upright. The only thing is, it IS rather large. This may be a problem for those with smaller bathrooms/counters."
5,The Best!!!,"This bath tub was the best purchase. We originally had a smaller tub which was great while my son was young, but once he hit 6 months and could somewhat sit up it was time for something else...This tub is great because he can lean back and splash his feet, and he's supported all the way around. Also, when they can sit up really well, you position them on the other end and the bottom support get them from the other side. My son just loves this and really like to splash around in it. I would buy this and nothing else.About the only thing I would do is add a small hand towel, for under their back and bottom, just for added non-slipping."
2,"Too big, bulky, and slippery...........","I bought this tub for my daughter (now 1). She is a small, petite girl and I always felt like she was too small for this tub, even now. I stopped using it. It is very big and bulky and the hard plastic is slippery and there is no cushioning for her head. I did like the soap holder and the fact that the tub can be used with older babies as well. But it just did not work for us."
2,Not so great.,Its huge. It doesnt fit on my bath. Its even a tight squeeze inside the tub. When I bathe my baby in the tub it kills my back so I have to put the tub on the floor which is a tight squeeze because my bathroom is so small.The bath does have 2 sides. One end is for smaller babies. They can lay down and cant slip down due to the mid section. The other side is a lttle small.I dont use this bath much because of the size of it. My daughter prefers to beable to swim in the main bathtub or shower with me.
3,OK for the first 7 months.,"I bought the Eurobath becouse all the reviews stated how good it was. It was great for 7 1/2 months! My daughter is really active, and she did not want to lay down while I was bathing her. So I tried the sitting postion but she just slipped and slided all over the place. It actually became quite dangerous! I now have the Safty 1st seat that attaches to the bath tub. I will have to see how long this will last."
5,Great Support for Your Little One,"My husband and I love this tub. It is definitely a must have! Our daughter is two months old and a wiggle worm in the bath, but we don't have to worry about her sliding around in this tub. Although it is a little bulky, she has plenty of room to swing her arms and kick her legs. The best part is that you have two free hands to bath your baby with because the tub supports them on its own. I highly recomend the EuroBath!"
5,well thought desing,easy to use and store. make all bath experience comfortable for both: mom and baby.
5,Very secure and pleasant for the child,"We bought this tub for our first child and have been very happy with it. It is very safe, while also spacious, and allows (especially first-time) parents to hold and bathe the child without risking to have him slip. Also, as an object, it is more aesthetic than other blue or green bathtubs. It fits easily in our own bathtub, and therefore does not eat much space. We strongly recommend it!"
5,Awesome bath tub!!,"My son (now 5 months old) hated taking baths since he was an infant. He would just scream as soon as I put him in the water until I was finished. Needless to say, I was always rushing through the bathing process and felt very stressed and upset.I read all the wonderful reviews about the Eurobath and was sold. I tried it out on my son and the moment I put him in, no screaming! He loved that he could be remain completely still and not slip down into the water. He also loved that he could kick his feet and move his arms to his little heart's content without banging them into anything. Yes, this tub is huge! But I found a way to hang it up high on the bathtub wall, so it's out of the way when my 1 1/2 year old daughter takes her bath.I can now look forward to giving my son a bath and know he will be happy. Bathing time is such an important bonding time for baby and parent and should always be an enjoyable experience.This is such a wonderful product and well worth the money!"
3,Better for bigger babies,"After reading reviews of the Eurobath, I was anxious to get one before my baby was born. When he was ready for his first real bath (3 wks old), we found that the surface of this tub was too hard for him,he felt uncomfortable, and too large (he was about 8 pounds and 21 inches at the time). A good feature is the ""infant seat"" which keeps him well positioned so both your hands are free to wash baby. But this is probably going to be better for our baby when he's a little bigger."
1,This tub is too big for infants,"I bought this tub because I felt my 8 month-old had outgrown his old tub (First Years Infant to Toddler Tub), but THE PRIMO TUB IS TOO BIG. My son moves around a lot in the tub, and everytime he moved he slipped, nearly going under each time. It was scary and I couldn't wait to get him out, and back into his slightly smaller, but much safer, First Year's tub.My son is now 10 mos, and I just tried the Primo tub again, this time with non-slip, suction cup circles that I bought specifically to use with this tub. He did fine as long as he just sat and didn't try to move....that lasted maybe 5 minutes! As soon as he tried to turn around or stand up, he slipped and went under. I was right there, and caught him immediately, but it was scary.I actually still think this could be a good tub, but it's just not for little ones. I'm going to guess and say maybe for 1 year-olds and up. Needless to say, I'm sticking to my trusty blue First Years tub."
2,what a huge tub this is,"I didn't know any better - first time mom - I registered for this huge thing. It's slippery when you put a newborn in it & they don't fit in the seat properly, my son was very uncomfortable and cried. I used a smaller tub now, but will keep this for when he is older and can use the other side of it. For now, I have to figure out where to store the huge thing."
2,Too big,"I really wanted to love this bath, but I don't.It is just too big even in my rather big bathroom.My baby wasn't really into this tub either.I'm still keeping it in case if we have another baby.If you are having a first baby, I would recommend using Infant Bath Seat from primo.It is easy to use, clean and store. My baby liked it better."
5,Love this tub!,"We've used this tub since my son was a few weeks old. He's 6 months old now, and we couldn't be happier with it. He is still sitting on the newborn side, since he isn't completely sitting unsupported yet. It definitely keeps him in a safe position, which is a MUST with a wet, wiggly baby! Storage is the only downside to this tub. We keep ours upside down inside the regular bathtub. Upside down so that it dries after his bath, and cause our cat loves to climb in it for some reason. Luckily we have a second bathroom that we don't use for showering, otherwise I don't have a clue where I would keep it everyday."
1,Didn't work for us,"After reading such great reviews I registered for this tub. It never worked for my daughter. Everytime I put her in it, she wiggled right out of the holding seat. She was a big baby, so it's not like she was too small for it. I just used the safer bather mat in the regular tub and she loved it. When she was old enough to sit up I tried again, but by this time she preferred splashing in the big tub so I gave mine away."
1,pretty useless,"A lot of people recommended this to us, and we coughtit, but next time we definitely won't. when your baby isn't sitting yet, you are better off with a smaller tub that has a better surface for the baby to lie on. When you kid is sitting, all the shaping of this tub is in the way of his legs and his toys! Better to use big tub or ikea baby tub. Very bulky too :(("
5,Makes bathing fun and easy!,"This is the BEST bath tub! We put our newborn in this tub and were amazed at how well she stayed in the contour grooves. She did not slide around at all. This tub also makes washing your baby's hair a breeze. The angle of the headrest allows the water to drip backwards and not in the baby's face. This tub is large and probably won't fit in your kitchen sink but it is well worth it for CAREFREE bathing. Plus, you can get really great ""1st bath"" photos..smile and enjoy!"
5,Great Tub!,"After reading all the reviews for this tub, we bought it first and have never been sorry. Our 4 month old has been safe and comfortable in it since she was 2 weeks old. True, there is no padding, but we just set a towel into the inserts, then set her on it. She never slips, and we can use 2 hands to wash her. It is a big tub, but that's what makes it great. After she gets to big for the baby side of the tub (where the inserts are), she can move to the deeper side. It saves us the cost of a new bathtub when she gets bigger!"
2,Cute but VERY LOUD,"I really like the look of the clock, but it ticks louder than any other clock I have ever heard. I have it in the nursery and can hear it in the living room. My husband is going to try to insulate the back to see if it will muffle the noise. I hope he can otherwise we may be sending it back."
3,Not for engineers,"Well, I did not read the whole book yet but so far there's nothing new there for me. I do recommend the book for people with no technical background. Those of us that have good background in physics and electricity will not benefit much."
3,Good Intro solar Text,This is a great starting manual for introducing solar installation. The worksheets could be better and updated. The use of nominal voltage and other parameters could be done better.
5,Renuable Energy Education for a Sustainable Future,"Great book, easy to understand for everyone. We all need to work toward this kind of lifestyle. Including supporting our communities, making them more levable, and buying local."
4,Solar Book,Have interest in the solar industry and happy for this book that details installation of the various PV systems
3,PV Reviews,I have been doing quite a lot of research on the subject as of recently. There have been some new develoments as it relates to green tax credits and the cost of Photovoltaic systems. The book does a good job of laying out the basics for PV systems and designs. It is worth the money but if you would like a quick glance. Check out this site.[....]
3,Comprehensive it's not!,Given all the raves this book got I was pretty disappointed. I was expecting a comprehensive design and install manual. What I got was PV 101.It's not bad if you have no background in the field and want a basic intro but this manual sorely lacks in depth material on the subject. I am a contractor looking to expand into PV installations. This book barely got my feet wet.
2,Basic and padded and pretty useless,The first half of this book provides useful basic information on solar systems but it quite out of date. The second half of the book is missing in that it is padded with solar insulation tables and other things much easier to find on the internet.Skip this book.
3,Good overview but dated,"This book is used currently by the Solar International as a text book but is long in the tooth for this field, having been published in 2004. This field is fast growing and changing so while this book covers the topic well you should look for a newer manual for up to date information."
5,Photovoltaics Design and Installation Manual,"This is a low-cost and easy to read and understand book for designing and installing PV systems. I highly recommend it for interested students, engineers and contractors."
2,Good,Cover was in OK shape but I am happy with it for what it will be used for.Price was good and book has a lot of information in it.
5,Outstanding book,The book covers the basics very well in clear easy to understand text and illistrations. Also has problems to work out in each section. This is an outstanding book
4,Great Reference,After the first few pages I knew that this was a good reference. Being a DIY person I found that this book did an excellent job expaining the theory and gave examples of practical application. Things were explained in laymans terms and all aspects of materials to use and the installation process were covered. At the end of every chapter there are questions to test your understanding of the material. These questions can be easily adopted to designing your own system. If you are considering installing a system yourself make this the first book you buy.
3,So So Solar,"Not a bad book, but it gives itself way too much credit by billing itself as a ""Design and Installation Manual"". This 315 page book could be condensed into a 50 page useful book entitled ""A Basic Introduction to Considerations in Photovoltaic Design and Installation"". It's choppy to read, and it has a lot of filler, generalities, and truisms. Expect a lot of this: ""The major aspects of installing the photovoltaic array are choosing the most applicable mounting systems and making a proper installation"". Some of the electrical theory is questionable. Still, it's the best book I've found, which means there is a great opportunity for a knowledgable PV systems integrator who can write well and put together a comprehensive, well-written text on the subject."
3,Could be better,"It is a nice overview of the subject, however it lacks specifics. Ie it would be nice if it coverd more about installation and supplies."
3,Average book on subject,"This book was a required text for a photovoltaic design class. The book is an adequate introduction to photovoltaics but lacks technical depth as a reference. A large portion of the book is ""irradiation tables"" which are available from many free sources."
3,Essentials Are There,"""Photovoltaics: Design and Installation Manual"" has all the essential basics for disigning and building a system.It covers serial and parallel circuitry and other electrical aspects necessary to the construction of a photovoltaic system.The reading is a little dry, but that is the nature of the subject,isn't it?"
5,Yay!,I first watched JSA in language school and have loved it ever since. I watch it once every 2-3 months.
4,Truth is dangerous,"This is an interesting mystery set in the DMZ-between North and South Korea. Two South Korean soldiers begin visiting two North Korean soldiers and a friendship develops between them--but things go terribly wrong and two North Koreans wind up dead--including one of the friends. Due to the circumstances--""enemy"" soldiers making friends in contravention to their orders--all involved are reluctant to tell the truth. The daughter of a North Korean expatriate is assigned the investigation-and though she uncovers the truth--it is a truth she cannot fully reveal.The movie is interesting on it's own--but the message is clear--it's not soldiers who make war--it's politicians and governments!Well worth watching!"
4,By a Mom,"I confess that I found this book absorbing. I hated to put it down, because I wanted to see what happened next. I love books with endings that are not necessarily predictable. It portrayed a very realistic slice of life for a young girl amidst the turmoil of middle school. Many of the issues dealt with in this book will be recognizable,not only to the young adults who will read this book and want to share it with their friends,but to adults who dealt with their own pubescent transitions. I read a lot of young adult literature,as I have nieces and daughters who love to read:I will be sending a copy of this book to those nieces,and saving my copy for my children. I will also look forward to more books from this fine author."
4,"Expensive, but it does work.","I used two of these to hang two bikes horizontally. They were a bit expensive and it would be very tight to fit four as advertised as two was a bit snug, but it did work and meet my needs"
3,I returned this product,"I returned this item, not for any flaws.....I bought it for my husbands surprise garage makeover and he didn't like the design."
5,Wonderful!,I have found my favorite tea! This is the best I have had in my 62 years. I will order more from this company. The order was processed quickly and I received the order in a short time. They have found in me a very happy consumer. I will continue ordering this yummy cinnamon tea.
1,Not worth it! However.... recieved outstanding costumer service!,"Don't buy this! 2 items broke within minutes of opening the package! The orange gun and handcuffs, the most essential police tools! I returned item through amazon prime and was imediately refunded! Within 3 hours! Thanks Amazon!"
3,Very flimsy,"The belt served its purpose for halloween. However, the belt itself is very weak and tears very easy. Would not hold up for everday play use too long."
3,Decent product for the price.,"Purchased as accessories for our daughter's police officer costume for Halloween. Flashlight worked for about 10 mins and then stopped working, even with brand new batteries. We didn't use the gun or holster, but she really enjoyed the other items on the belt and continues to play with them now. Overall, decent item for the price."
3,Better than nothing,"I searched hard to find a good quality police belt to go with my 6 year old grandson's police costume and this is the only choice I came up with. It is better than nothing, but the belt is very poor quality. I would pay more to have a police belt that would last, but I guess no one has decided to make one. I had to sew the holster loop back on the third day of it being used. However, my grandson didn't take this off except to sleep for days following his birthday. He is happy with it even though the metal hole covers on the belt have all come off."
3,Police set,"The belt didn't really work well, and the night stick got broke before halloween, but my son loved this set."
4,fun but not durable enough...,"fun but not durable enough...For my little guy! He absolutely loved this belt to go with his S.W.A.T. costume, but he had already broken the handcuffs and another feature of the belt by the time he wore it with his costume."
4,My son loves his policeman belt!,My son loves everything 'policeman' so this belt was just theperfect gift! He especially loves the flashlight and handcuffs!
3,good,"The product was valuable for my child but poor in quality. The flash light wasant working,I understand its just $15 but atleast the things should work.Kids love it and play with it constantly."
2,Police Man Accessories Belt,"Good selection of toys included, but not very durable. One of the handcuffs broke the very first day my son started playing with this item. On the other hand, the belt is way too soft to hold all those accessories and does not look like it's going to last for a very long time. Expected much better quality for the price."
2,not worth the price,"The quality of this toy is something I would expect to find at the dollar store, cheap material, cheap plastic. Too expensive for the quality."
2,Belt didn't hold up one day to a 6 year old!,"My grandson wants to be a police officer for Halloween. He asked to play with this since it came before his costume and the cheapness and bad quality of this belt did not hold up to a 6 year old for 5 hours. Within that time, it started coming apart. The gromets pulled out and the tabs that held the walkie talkie and flashlight broke. This was not worth the price if your child is going to play with it all the time."
1,Police Belt,"We purchased this police belt for my son for Christmas - I have to say he loves it, But it is so poorly made. The actual belt is the thinnest fabric. The belt holes have now broken off. The part where you hang the flashlight and truncheon have come apart. All in all it was a complete waste of money. I have now made a new belt for him"
5,It's a Sandman collection...,Someone had stolen this volume from me and I'd had to replace it. I've learned to buy multiples of his novels. Those never come back either.
5,Work in the Reader's Head,"This collection contains two of Gaiman's best short stories. ""Dream of a Thousand Cats,"" with its gorgeous artwork by Kelley Jones and Malcolm Jones III, is one of the great ironic cat stories. And ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" which actually won a World Fantasy Award. The Award committee was so chagrined by the notion of a comic book winning the prize that they changed the rules to prevent such an abomination from ever happening again. Ah, what fools these mortals be. The collection also includes, as a bonus, a copy of Gaiman's script for another story, ""Calliope,"" in which the magician shows us how the illusion is created. In one of his panel descriptions we see the key to his method: ""NOW I WANT TO GET ACROSS THE RAPE, AND THE HORROR AND THE DOMINANCE, FAIRLY SUBTLY, DOING ALL THE WORK IN THE READER'S HEAD."" Yes, indeed. That's where Gaiman always does his best work. In the reader's head"
3,Double filler,"Others have written enough about the story content, so I just want to add an additional annoyance with this volume: the last 40 pages (out of 160) are just for the script of 'Calliope'. All text. No pictures... The book was already short enough compared to the others. And that script took even more away from it..."
5,Dream Country,"Excellent book, it is a few seperate stories but there is some background of the main characters not to be missed."
3,(Sands of) Time Filler,A decent addition to the Sandman books - but they were very much a series of apparently unrelated short stories touching upon the tales of Morpheus without furthering the juicy storyline developed in Volumes 1 & 2 and then later picked up again in Volume 4. Interesting but ultimately unthrilling.
4,Nice collection of stories,"This book breaks away from the main story of Sandman, and is not a full arc in itself, but rather a collection of short stories spanning different periods of time. Some people don't like short story collections, but I happened to like this book, the stories in here are really interesting, we get a cool one about cats, and also one about Callisto (yes, the Muse) a former lover of Morpheus."
4,Vol. 3: Contains one of my favourite stories of the Sandman series,"There are four stories in this collection: Calliope, A Dream of a Thousand Cats, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Faade. I totally `get' A Midsummer Night's Dream - it is amazing. The way Neil Gaiman has combined fact and fantasy into his world is amazing and original. William Shakespeare's son really died at around the age depicted in the story. I can see why it won all the awards. The story about the cats is also fascinating. However, it was beaten as my favourite by some stories in Vol 6 of the Sandman Series, especially ""The Hunt"". The other stories were so-so in my view. I am not one for disturbing dreams, or for reading about them. This was a treat overall, though."
4,Terrific Reading,"At first, I didn't know what Gaiman was trying to do in the this collection. It seemed so different from the previous two works. However, after reading his thoughts at the end of the collection, I had a greater appreciation and enjoyed the fact that he had focused on these smaller stories. These stories are haunting and made me anticipate the rest of the series."
4,Operation Crowbar,"I have a predisposition to love the books of Frederick Forsyth as he wrote one of my favorite books of all time:The Day of the Jackal. I would've given this story five stars as well, except for a VERY convenient coincidence that happens in about the middle of the book. I won't spoil it, but it really shocked me how out of place it felt, not to mention unnecessary. It just seemed so stunningly unrealistic compared to the authenticity of the rest of the book, but I got over it.Forsyth is a master at spitting out details in a suspenseful way that really grabs me. It feels real, like a good Michael Mann movie. I like being in the hands of competent authors, and he is certainly that. Definitely recommended."
2,Don't bother,"If comic-book heroes, a fanciful plot, implausible dialogue and long, rambling explanatory passages are your thing, then Frederick's your (man's) man."
3,Got me hooked from the start,"The plot and characters are cleverly woven from start to finish. The suspense build up and maintenance keep the pages flying by.It ends with a little anticlimax though. Overall, good title."
1,very bad literature,"a ton of boring and distracting technical details as if coming from an army recruiting office, a plot that in the end does not make much sense, boring narrative, in short it's not a day of the jackal. too bad, used to be my favorite thriller writer."
1,Not very good.,Ive read more than half the novel and I am ready to put it down for good. The intro is so long and boring. For me this novel is a waste of time.
4,Great book - Sad Technical Error,"I enjoyed the book particularly his insight into the minds and actions of terrorists. I realize that the technical information in a novel is not expected to be accurate or even true. However, on page 325 there is a statement relating to ""southern great circle route"". There is no such thing in the northern hemisphere, its basic spherical geometry, not a technical term appropriate for fictionalizing in a novel. Take a southern route for the warm weather but pay for the extra time and fuel."
3,Next read the real story that is more shocking than fiction,You will be amazed when you learn what really happened in Afghanistan and how this whole mess came about when you read the real story in Charlie Wilson's War by George Crile. It becomes more fantastic the farther you read.
1,He wasn't trying with this one...,"I've enjoyed most of his other books but about 80% into the book I'm fed up and have decided to give up. It was mediocre up til them but it was enough to keep me going. The last straw was when **SPOILER** the bad guy, housed in a in high security camp in the middle of nowhere escapes because a fighter jet that was flying overhead catches a wrench in the engine, the jet blows apart, the engine falls, rips through the camp, kills the guards and opens a hole in the cell for the bad guy to walk out. Give me a break! I'm going to throw this one in the bin and re-read Day of the Jackal."
4,Factual to todays world,Sometimes a little difficult to follow with all the mid-eastern names and towns it continued to draw us forward. Following the British operative moving through the radicals and becoming in their eyes one of them. The last hundred pages brings everything together with a surprising ending. I thoughly enjoyed the novel and feel it was up to date with the world at this point in time.
2,Very Disappointing,"I have been a avid reader of this author since I firsat read ""The Day of the Jackal"". Unfortunately since ""The Fist of God"" his writing skills seem to have diminished. His books are shorter and show considerably less skill in plot development. ""The Afghan"" spends and unreaasonable amount of time re-acquainting the reader with Major Martin, wholly wasted. The ending is not one that I would expect from an author of Mr. Forsyth's reputation.Alas, Mr Forsyth is not alone in showing diminishing talents. W.E.B. Griffin's latest book,""The Saboteurs"" was similarly flawed. Maybe the authors are just getting older, and their older readership, myself included, is not as forgiving."
3,Commercial,Literate as we have come to expect from Forsyth. Somewhat suspensful but certainly not among Forsyth's best. Probably disappointing because we dot not see results such as this in the war on terror.
4,"Excellent, Detailed, Compelling Thriller","Forsyth is the venerable master when it comes to writing tales of international intrigue and this is no exception. In this book you will be heartened by the incredible detail of how the western world conducts its war on terror. I have no reason to believe that the tools and weapons employed by western governments are not accurately described and I am more optimistic than ever that we are winning this war in the back alleys and seaports of the world. On top of this amazing infrastructure of global terror and the war against it, we have a book that is rich with suspense and plot turns. However, you can't have everything and I would say that the characters are weakly drawn and the plot gets a little confusing in spots. But all in all, it's a good yarn -- well worth the time you will spend with it."
1,Forsyth's poorest effort.,"Frederick Forsyth has been one of my favorite authors and expected this book to be an update to The Fist Of God. I found the plot to be very scattered and that events that took place to be so far out without contributing to the book. Very little of the book centered on who I thought was the central character, but based on the jumping around, there was no real central character. After so many excellent books, one dud can be forgiven."
1,Forsyth on the Slide,"John Forsyth has been one of my favorite fiction writers. However, this novel is a severe disappointment that I would recommend to no one.His research was poor. The plot was awkward and choppy. The whole thing seemed thrown together and a one star rating is more than it deserves."
1,Flaccid Prose,"This book has all the excitement of a Wikipedia entry. I suspect most of the factual information (about 40% of the narrative) was taken from Wikipedia.The plot is pathetically thin. The characters are cartoonish beyond belief:The evil and fanatical Jihadist and the ""good"" British agent matching (all-too slow) wits.The Brit speaks no Pashto, but travels thru' Afghanistan and half around world impersonating Afghan war-lord! No one discovers he speaks no native Afghan language!Next installment: Black CIA agent who speaks no Russian tricks Russian FSB by impersonating a defected Russian spy. With this author all is possible."
2,Big letdown for Forsyth fans...very average book by Forsyth Standards,"Being a great fan of Frederick Forsyth, I was eagerly waiting for the next installment of intrigue and drama from the great one.The Afghan was big disappointment for me. The book falls short on a number of accounts when compared to his previous offerings. Detailed information and complex plot are Forsyth hallmarks. This novel fails in both aspects. Also the story lacks the drive and engrossing quality of his other novels. If you add an ending which peters out rather than reaching the climax then you have a very oridinary novel by Forsyth standards.But then again, the novel is ordinary only by his own standards. If you have not read a Forsyth novel before then it can be a good read. Also the media hype surrounding Al-qaeda and taliban and easy availibility of information about them may have taken out some intrigue from the book."
4,A highly unusual ending for a book written by Forsyth !,"The rapid fire narratives are still there. As do the meticulous research and intricate plot twists. The theme relating to current events is the basis of some of the greatest stories Forsyth has ever written (Jackal, Icon, Jackal, Dogs of War, Fourth Protocol), and is one of the reasons that attract people to keep buying his books. It is also a welcome return to form after the ""small stories"" contained in his last several outtings.However, what really differentiates his books from the work of others are the surprise endings that propel readers to keep going to the end with the goal to discover what they are. Sadly, this book contains no such ""surprise ending"" - the first Forsyth story ever to end like this."
2,FF Sold Himself Short,"I am a long-time fan of FF and have read a good number of his writings. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with this installment. The idea is a spin-off of ""The Fist of God"" (the reuse of the Martin brothers), but the characters are not developed any further. The story is borderline ludicrous, but worst of all, the pace is slow and not much happens until the last 60 pages, and even that isn't great.I wouldn't write FF off for this faux pas, but I wouldn't recommend it."
5,The Afghan gets to all your senses!,"By the time you have finished the first disc of this audio book, which I might add is beautifully narrated by Robert Powell, you can't wait to get through the following eight unabridged CDs. The characters pull you in!Fredrick Forsyth, as usual, has so well researched the facts and background to his story that when you are finished you feel you have completed a short but intensive course in geography, history, language, weapons use, spy technology, maritime lore and the best types of WMD. Don't feel ashamed to take out your National Geographic maps to follow the ever twisting plot. You will have all your senses involved!Other reviewers have explained the story line....so all I can add is that if you like reading (listening) to a story that has a major dose of in-your-face current affairs with a nail-biting edge,the Afgan wins hands down. Now I can only wish somebody buys the rights to make the movie."
1,Another exhausted source,"This book is clearly ""made to sell"" and this is its major flaw. The plot is interesting, albeit not new (planting a mole behind the enemy lines is spycraft standard business). But the way the idea has been taken into words is definitely disappointing. A relevant part of the book seems to be written just to satisfy the publisher, buy forcing the reader through hundred of pages of boring memoirs. The research (one of Mr. Forsyth strongest merit) is definitely not meeting the usual standard. To put it short: this book could have been written in less than a half of its actual page numbers."
1,Stupid book,"Plot is entirely built on preposterous coincidences: the lazy way to write a novel. Read ""Acts of Faith"" by Phil Caputo if you want an intelligent, well researched novel about Arab terrorism."
2,Below his best,"This is way below the author's best. It starts off well but about 2/3 way through the story loses all credibility due to a ridiculously unlikely incident, which has been referred to in earlier reviews. Whilst Forsyth inevitably fills his novels with absorbing details which are not missing here, readers who enjoyed Day of the Jackal, The Odessa File, The Negotiator or The Avenger will be disappointed. I know I was!"
2,The Afgan,This book was a disappointment. If one had read The Fist of God as I have done then half of the book is a repeat of that book and to be quite frank some of it isn't an exact copy of what had previously occurred. I re-read the Fist of God just to make sure. For a writer that produces many and well read best sellers this is simply not up to the mark.The Afghan
3,Rocky Read,"My favorite thriller is Forsyth's ""Day of the Jackal"" - which ""The Afghan"" attempts to equal or exceed; but the bar has been set too high. Although the book has patches of excellence, an equal number are deficient. A fussy reader will find many distractions; however, there is enough Forsyth to carry the day, at least to three stars."
2,Disappointing,"Generally, I like Forsyth's work a lot: The Day of the Jackal and The Odessa File are among the greatest thrillers of all time. But I'm afraid I didn't care much for this one. The story isn't very tightly plotted, and so with the lack of character development that has always been a weakness of Forsyth's, the narrative drags along intolerably at times. There is too much coincidence for the plot to be credible, and the wealth of technical details overwhelms rather the educates the reader. Even with all of these weaknesses, this novel is serviceable enough as beach or airplane reading. Still, The Afghan is disappointing when you realize what brilliant books Forsyth turned out in the past."
2,Narrator not clear,"I would have liked listening to this new Frederick Forsyth novel, however the narrator seems to just whisper the last words of the sentence. He would start out good narrating the sentence and then at the end would 'murmur' his last words. I would have to actually turn up and down the volume just to listen to him.I thought I could listen to the whole CD and probably then get used to him, but I gave up after the first CD and decided to just read the book instead of listening to the audio CD.I wish there would be a more distinct narrator that would be fun to listen to."
2,Worst Forsyth ever.,"This book, for me, a major FF fan was a big letdown. Sure the heavy duty tech. stuff is all there but I thought the pace was too leasurely.There is also a sequence of events in the latter part which brings the words ludicrous and ridiculous to mind, almost as if he were being paid by the word.Still, he has written some great stories and one clunker does not a career break."
3,"Not bad, not great, good info and scary....","anytime you read a book about terriorism, it is scary....there are so many ways......this book moves fast, but is just missing something, not sure what. not a bad read...."
3,Not His Best,"This is a well researched novel with the usual amount of detail that one has come to expect in the work of this witer. The problem that I experienced was that the plot had numerous characters and, at times, did not have the smooth flow which usually has been found to exist in his writings. It is a good story, although it is a page turner. Much of what takes place is carefully scripted and is frequently predictable. The characters lack depth and are somewhat cartoonish in nature. This is not anywhere near the quality that was found to exist in Day of the Jackal, The Odessa File or even his more recent book, The Avenger. It is an average book and a step back for Forsyth, a man who once was in the category of John LeCarre."
3,History Lesson,"I just finished reading Forsyth's latest, and although the book was heavy in coincidences & light on action, I found the background on AQ interesting. The blending of historical fact and character fiction, is as always in his books, the reason I've enjoyed his writing for the last 30 years.Like many readers I had problems with the ""Afghan's"" role on the ship, the floating G8 summit, and especially, the fighter engine dropping onto the remote cabin. Why was someone with Khan's background needed to steer a ship; why, with all of the focus on preventing a disaster at sea would the QM2 be allowed to venture out into the Atlantic (how did AQ find out about this); while the chase of Khan was dramatic, it did little to forward the plot.These things said, I still enjoyed the 1st & last qtrs of the book and unlike other readers, found the ending, although not very explicit, somewhat satisfying."
3,The Afghan,"Started with a Bang. Ended with barely a whimper. Very disappointing. Time to put away the ""quill"" Frederick!!!"
3,Good summer escape,"I enjoyed this book. It keeps you interested with the level of ""insider"" details. I intended to wait and read this at the beach later this summer, but once I started to read it, I got hooked. It is not Forsyth's best effort. (The Day of the Jackal was so great, I doubt he'll ever match it.) That said, for a great escape that does fit with today's reality, I recommend this book."
1,Awful,I have always been a big fan of Frederick Forsyth and have enjoyed his previous books immensely. He must have lost his writing ability or his mind because this book is unreadable. It does appear to reflect some amount of research but reads more like a report than a novel. It has no plot that you can get involved in and the character development is minimal. It reads like the first book written by a recent college graduate who failed all of his writing classes. It is downright awful. Don't waste your time or money on this waste of paper.
4,Classic Forsyth,"With The Afghan, Forsyth is back with a political thriller that plays to his strength. Like many of the novels published in the post-9/11 era, Forsyth's story follows an al-Qaeda storyline. Unlike some of the others, Forsyth can at least claim that he had addressed the Middle East terrorist genre well before 9/11 with his very good effort, Fist of God. In The Afghan, he spins a very interesting tale about the efforts of American and British intelligence and governmental organizations to thwart what is believed to be a future attack on the West.Forsyth is able to effectively weave cultural and political facts and actual events into the story to provide a realistic backdrop for the action - and there IS action. The Afghan was very difficult to put down. The story moves forward with pace - full of suspense and plot twists that the reader has come to expect from Forsyth. For anyone interested in the political thriller genre, the Afghan is a ""must read."""
1,Riding prior fame to write a steaming pile,"I have enjoyed many of Forsyth's prior books, but this one was terrible. The finale is worse than I could have imagined, making me wonder why I wasted time reading the book at all. It's not even really clear what the finale is, except that it's over in a flash. If fact it becomes entirely clear that the author must have envisioned a type of terrorist attack and then scrambled to come up with an explanation how that attact might be thwarted and why his hero was there at the right place and the right time; although there is no explanation why the terrorists themselves actually need the hero (in disguise) on their team at all, except that Bin Laden wants him on the team. Um okay, for what? He add NOTHING to the cadre of criminals leading this attack. C'mon, Forsyth, are you kidding me?"
1,Forsythe Drops the ball,"""Col Mike Martin"" raised in Iraq, speaks fluent arabic.........The Taliban are Pashtoon, they are not arabs, they don't speak arabic, they don't even like arabs very much. They are a totaly closed tribal society. I spent a year living and working with the Pashtoon in 2005 in Helmand Province. There are no members of the Taliban who are not Pashtoon. The other ethnic groups in Afghanistan, the Tajik and the Hazara, are opposed to the Taliban.Mike Martin would not have the correct family, clan and tribal ties and background to carry this off.Sorry, but Forsythe has dropped the ball on this one."
2,Wait for the paperback,"I read the Day of the Jackal years ago and seem to recall it was meticulously researched and very plausible. Neither is the case here. The sections on how NSA and GCHQ do their jobs are laughable and could have been improved with a little checking on Google. As mentioned in other reviews there's probably a 100 pages or so of filler. I'm two-thirds of the way through and doubt I'll even bother finishing. And as is the case with many books today, the editing is slipshod."
1,Not good,"I love political thrillers. But this one is unbelievably badly written. The intro is long and boring - or the subject is interesting, but it's just factual notes without anything to carry it. And the turns of the plot are not credible. Has Forsythe lost his motivation?"
4,Mixed Reviews But Still Good Thriller,"This book has received mixed reviews of this forum. Particularly in the area of accurate research. Nevertheless, I've always enjoyed the author going back to Day Of The Jackal,The Odessa File and The Dogs Of War. I've missed him lately and hope he's back. I found this to be a good attention holding read. The idea of attack from the sea is real and could indeed be disastrous. Col. Mike Martin and Izmat Khan were both good characters. All in all this was a worthwhile read."
2,AVID READER,"Having been enthralled with ""The Odessa File"", ""The Day of the Jackal"" and ""The Dogs of War"" I cannot believe that Frederick Forsyth's new book, ""The Afgan"" is by the same author. It is a history book, devoid of interesting characters and there is very little dialogue..If I had wanted non fiction that would be one thing, but as a novel, I am so disappointed. Boring.... Please Mr.Forsyth, go back to your old dynamic style. I am sorry I bought it and would not have wasted my time taking it out of a library. Tut Tut."
2,"Annoying, sloppy and very disappointing","It's hard to believe this is from the author who gave us the classic Day of the Jackal. Forsyth's scene-setting is not exactly riddled with factual errors but there are enough to be quite frustrating. Unusually, Forsyth stretches credibility to breaking point: Take the scenario where a terrorist is held in a well-guarded and remote cabin in the northern wilderness. How does Forsyth engineer his escape? A fighter jet accidently falls out the sky and wipes out the guards. That whole episode is, in fact, a quite useless excursion in that it has no influence on the plot and serves only to pad out the story.The mantle of this genre now firmly possessed by the admirable and extremely readable Gerald Seymour, an infinitely better writer."
2,A bit disappointing,"Wow. This was really a let down following so many great works from Mr. Forsyth. The ending was so anti-climatic, it just kind of fizzled away."
3,Enjoyable but not brilliant,"I really wanted to love The Afghan. The plot was taken straight from the headlines with a British agent assigned to infiltrate Al Quaeda to thwart a plot which would make 9/11 pale in comparison. The story was very readable but lacked passion. It was a bit like watching a chess match. The good guys train their mole to impersonate an Afghan held at Guantanamo Bay. The bad guys put a clever plot involving exploding ships in motion. In the end, the build up really didn't pay off. After explaining how impossible it would be to infiltrate Al Qaeda, our hero does so without much difficulty. When the true nature of the AQ plot is revealed, it is indeed horrendous. However, the terrorists are so matter of fact that it lacks excitement. This reads more like a computer simulation than something which could have really happened."
1,Page 137 and I quit,"Well, I LOVED ""The Cobra."" This started out good...but I am now lost in the middle of the desert...literally and figuratively. There seems to be no story here...just a history lesson...page after page. Sorry, it lost my interest."
1,Yawn,"This is the first book I've read from Forsyth. The first half is awfully boring, once ""The Afghan"" is on mission then things start to move at a certain pace, not enough to compensate for the first half though.If you have trouble sleeping this is the book for you. Hopefully Frederick's more famous novels won't be as bad..."
3,It matches the rest of my set,"But its made in china where the rest of my set was made in the USA I think this will be the last items I get, I dont want any thing made in China. For the most part it matches, it seems a little darker then my plates."
1,Video bad,My video does not play and I do not have receipt anymore. This item was not supposed to be used and DVD is very scratched
2,Problems with DVD,"This was the 2nd DVD with problems that I bought from this vendor. The first DVD had 2 sections where the DVD would pause but would continue playing, and I was willing to live with it. Bootcamp/Muscle Endurance, on the other hand, would not play the Muscle Endurance workout at all! I contacted the vendor and they said it was a problem with my DVD player and they would only allow me to exchange with any of their 'OPEN' dvds only to 'better suite my needs'. I own 20+ workout DVDs and none of them gave me any problems like this one did. The DVD is also fairly pricey and so I'm afraid to buy any more of these dvds from them. I was able to play the Bootcamp workout until towards the end (before the cool down section) where it would not continue playing. I like Cathe's workout very much. The part of Bootcamp that I was able to play was excellent! But I am very disappointed with this vendor."
1,friedrich gone bad,"terrible customer service, absolutely the worse. Do not order from this website. I had a bad tape and it would NOT play, they refused to credit my account, insinuated that I had a ""duped"" copy from somewhere else!!"
2,Unreliable,"It turns out that this is the public relations member of the Silver Palate team, not the cook. The recipes read well and some turn out to be delicious, but you can't count on it. I, for one, don't have time to spend cooking from a book that I know gives me a fifty-fifty chance for a tasty result and that contains a number of errors. I gave my copy to Goodwill."
4,Some Great Recipies,"I need a book that will provide recipies that my kids will eat too. This book has these meals. The Chicken Pot Pie is great and diary free! The Every day Chicken is one of my weekly meals. Sure I haven't used a lot of the recipies, but if I can find two or three staples to my cooking fare then it's definately worth the price!"
3,Great Good Book,I really like the recipes and my family enjoys the food I prepare using this book. The only problem I have found to date is the number of servings is not always correct. I love the recipe BIG BREAKFAST COOKIES but can not make 64 cookies as the recipe says. 24 is the max. if you follow directions.
2,Agree with the other poor ratings,"This book may be useful as a first cook book. Have to agree with another reviewer who has an extensive cook book collection, that this book is not practical and locating recipes is difficult. Others found errors.An experienced cook can browse the list of ingredients and method to have a pretty good idea of the outcome. I have not cooked from this book as I did not find the recipes enticing. I received it as a gift. I find better recipes for my favorite dishes from the numerous online sources.The quantity of used copies available with some offered as low as $0.01 is an indication of its worth. Great cookbooks, especially those out of print, are a rare find on the used market and would fetch a good price when available.Since I won't get much selling it, I will give my copy to Goodwill as another reviewer did."
2,This cookbook was a real disappointment,"I have an extensive cookbook collection, and Great Good food has been a big disappointment. I have The New Basics and The Silver Palate, and each of them, while not favorites, have provided me with recipes which I have enjoyed. Both are also fairly easy to use. However, Great Good Food has never provided me with anything that I really wanted to make again. Moreover, searching for a particular type of recipe is a chore. Recipes are broken up into ""menus"" and ""seasons"". When, for example, I want to look for appetizers or a soup, I don't want to have to spend an hour flipping through the whole book looking to see whether I've missed anything. Convenient it is not."
2,Needs an editor -- badly!,"So many of the recipes contain errors that I find I can't trust the book in general. Case in point: a vegetable stock recipe that does not include or refer to any liquid whatsoever. This is fine for those with experience, but is a shocking oversight for a book touted as easy to use. Two TABLESPOONS of vanilla flavoring in a batch of one dozen small muffins? Gimme a break! With these kinds of errors, I can't say that I use the book much. However, it does have some interesting ideas as starting points for your own recipes....."
5,GREAT GOOD RECIPES!!,"Have not found a bad recipe in the book. Every dish I have tried has come out well. Have been getting compliments and sharing these recipes with others but am now buying copies as gifts for family and friends. Recipes are easy to follow and ingredients are usually on my shelves or easily obtainable. One of our daughters has the original ""Basics"" and I had the ""Great"" one without either of us knowing it. When I gave a hard-bound edition as a wedding gift, the bride wrote saying ""Thank you so much. My ""Silver Palate"" paperbook is nearly worn out."" Cook books do not come any better!"
4,Jesse Stone Film Collection,I love Robert Parker's books and love Tom Selleck in these movies. The movie's are good but the books are better.
3,Jesse stone series,I just love the Jesse Stone storyline by Rob Parker. I'm anxiously awaiting the next book in this series and hope that Tom Selleck will continue to make the movies.
5,Jessie Stone series,"No special effects, just solid intelligent acting, and screen play. A pleasure to watch actors develop the series into a comfortable family like group. Hope the series continues in spite of the death of the Author."
5,Stone Sober,Excellent murder mysteries. Selleck at his Best.Not your run of the millstoryline. Keeps you glued to the screen.
5,Great Movies,These movies should be considered some of Tom Selleck's best. I have a young daughter and she likes them also. These are great for family viewing and I can't wait for the next to come out.
2,Missing some features,"Pros: Slim, attractive, easy to see screen, good reception.Cons: Despite what the descriptions say, there is NO TEXT TO SPEECH!! I don't think I'll be hanging onto this for too long because of it. Also, it doesn't actually bring you directly to your address... if you want to go to 59 Main St, it will bring you to a range of addresses, like 1-400 Main St. It also doesn't seem to be all that accurate, almost like the map takes a little while to update itself to where you are. I'm considering getting rid of it."
2,Not Quite Ready for Prime Time,"I purchased this GPS because I use other Uniden products and at the time the price was attractive. 2-stars for a decent screen, but I've found more cons than pros.Pros - Bright, large, easy to read screen.Cons - Directions only guide you to a block (rather than specific address).Can zoom out only to 8 miles (you can't get a look at your progress on longer trips).Poor speaker which is hard to hear in some cars.Takes much longer to lock on satellites than Garmins we use at work.If Uniden wants to continue in the GPS market, they have some work to do. For a similar price, you can find much better options."
2,Disappointed!,"I couldn't find any of the places of interests that I need such as parks and schools. This unit took longer to get a lock on the satellites than my previous GPS unit, the ViaMichelin X-930. The turn signal lights are VERY DIM--virtually invisible during the day time. The design is very ugly like a brick. The antenna must be opened in order to have any signal. If you have a PDA, use your PDA with a BlueTooth receiver and get Mapopolis-BEST navigator I've ever used."
1,Don't Buy this,"Uniden has given me a written answer to my question of how to update the maps, even though their own users manuals states that map updates are available on their own website.... "" Uniden WILL NOT update their GPS products"" Not to mention this GPS is not very accurate. It also shows POI's (points of interest"" that have not been in my hometown for at least 7 years. If you want a throw away product, this could be for you."
2,Be warry of GPS devices with no reset option,"I have tried many GPS units, here are my thoughts looking at this one.This Uniden does not appear to have a reset button. If it ever locks up, which reading many GPS unit reviews seems some what common, how would you reset this unit? I believe this case is made by Samsung, I don't think Samsung includes reset ability. For the price, I would consider the Garmin units a more likely candidate for long term use."
5,Good Value - Good Vendor,"Best price I can find for these masks, which our construction crew uses routinely. This was our 3rd purchase from this vendor. Items are always promptly shipped. Recommended."
4,a face Mask that LASTS,"i like it ,but one problem i , ordered a size small ,and i needed a larger size, when it was all said done , the fine print says to refunds or returns for Masks, boo hoo. but past that it works."
3,Need audio,Turkish sounds are so different than English sounds that you really need an audio example to pronounce any of what's in this book. The Information is fine if you get some other audio guide. I took this with me but didn't use it at all on my trip.
4,Really good,"I got three different phrase books for three different languages (Greek, Arabic, Turkish). This was by far the best. Highly recommend it."
3,Lonely Planet Turkish phrasebook,Potential buyers of this phrasebook should be warned that it contains explicit sex and drug talk and is further replete with inappropriate vulgar language. It is definitely not for children. Older adults may be shocked at some of the phrases in this book. If you find youreself in a situation that requires the use of some of these phrases you're already in trouble and likely headed for even bigger trouble. I wouldn't buy this book again.
2,Buy a dictionary instead!!,"Buy a dictionary instead! It's extremely difficult to find the phrase you want in this book. Plus, phrases aren't that helpful when you are attempting basic communication in a new language - what you really need are words. Instead of attempting to memorize ""Could you please tell me where the bathroom is?"" you just need to say ""bathroom?"" But the dictionary in this book is small, and more than half of the time it did not contain the word I was looking for. So frustrating!!"
2,She needs voice lessons,"I know, I can't believe it either. When her voice cracked in ""Falling Forward,"" I thought she was just nervous, but she was consistently flat or off-pitch in every song. I was embarrassed for her. I guess she's just better off in studio. It's a crying shame."
5,I think you should buy this,"This performance is amazing. Julia Fordham has been one of my favorites for years, ever since ""Porcelain"" hit the charts. Yes, it's true that her pitch wanders a bit, but this is to be expected. I doubt that she does enough live performances to keep her voice in perfect shape. Elton John is the same, listen to ""Live in Australia"". You just need to feel this performance instead of critiquing it with a pitch meter. And then, brother, you are in for a treat. She twists and bends to wrench every bit out of every note. Her enthusiasm is infectious, she smiles all the time. She looks like she's absolutely in the moment. The band rocks. The bass line is nice and heavy but the vocals come through clear as a bell. Great mixing, in my opinion. I'm lucky I bought this."
3,despite padding and conjecture....,"Despite the conjecture in this book, the fact is, most of what happened in the ex-USSR (diplomatically AND militarily)went down, like the K-129, undocumented. Speculation and intel is about all we have to go on. This account is terribly fascinating, not so much because the vessel slipped through the Navy's anti-sub dragnet but, rather, why the K-129's commander got under way with 10 last-minute, unknown ""sailors."" Could it really have been so easy for a Soviet doomsday clique to engage?!?!?"
4,Ray the Great,"Have always been a big fan of Ray Conniff, his band and singers. Have a lot of his music on vinyl and have started collecting CD's. This CD is a classic and should be enjoyed by all"
4,We've Only Just Begun/Love Story by Ray Connifrf Singers,Two of Ray Conniff;s albums of the past containing some great songs of the sixties and seventies. If you love vocal music this will surely please you.
3,Handicapped,"Had I read this collection before her others, I would have fallen in love with this crafter of images and emotions in a different way. That said, I expected this to be a new collection, and was slightly disappointed to discover it to be a reprint. The poetry is vivid, but not as smooth as her other works. It is like a collection of sharp steel: bright with edges and tips. Her other books like _Alive Together: New and Selected Poems_, and _Waving From Shore_ are like intricate Spanish or Japanese swords; beautiful and intellectually/emotionally dangerous."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A Puffin, so a kids book. The Interstellar Guard, stretched with policing an ever-rapidly expanding volume of space turns to animals and machines for help.The Porcine Interstellar Guard, and the Robot Obtrusion Battalion Omega Three.A couple of examples are given of each, and one PIG crew has two 1000 pound mutant highly intelligent boars, for example. So pretty formidable. Two frontier backworlds with problems are visited."
2,Note that it's not long enough for many uses,"Traditional hard disks have 3 screw holes on each side. Many (esp Dell and HP) hard drive 'holders' now only use the front and back and not the middle ones. But this device is only long enough to have holes at the front and middle positions.The point being that if you wanted to put a 2.5"" drive in this and use it in many holders you'd only have connections at the front."
2,Stay away if needing for SSD,"Very disappointed with this mounting kit. I purchased it to mount a new M4 SSD into my computer, which requires I screw in the (what would be a 3.5"") HDD from the bottom of the drive, not the sides. when using this mounting kit, the 4 bottom underside holes do not line up to standard placements! I could only screw in 2 of the 4 screws--the 2 closest to the HDD connectors, not the far ones because they don't line up! Will never buy again for this purpose.In addition, I ended up using not a single one of the screws included! They were the wrong size for screwing in an SSD hard drive. Steer clear if needing this for an SSD 2.5"" to 3.5"" conversion kit."
3,Pretty good once figured out,"This item bedeviled me to no end. I could not figure it out.I tried for hours to align it to put a 2.5 SSD Drive on it.I gave up. I came back to it two days later and like a miracle, it fit.I would suggest to the company to Please put a picture showing howan idiot like me attaches the drive to the adapter.I felt so stupid, that I had to laugh at myself.This is a nice simple solution to 2.5 to 3.5. And cheap too.It is just not designed for idiots. LOL"
4,IT Buyer,A good solution for a relatively new problem.Makes moving files to a new Laptop drivemuch easier.
3,Not as good as I supposed,"Baduk stones are not as ""flat"" as they are represented on the picture. They were not equally produced ( some big , some small) and they were in irregular shapes (not exactly circular, somewhat elliptic or even worse, unidentified geometric shapes). Besides each stone had to be precisely flat but they were not."
5,"A Gem of a book for ""old school"" watchmaking techniques","If you want to make a handmade watch or clock, this book is a Gold mine of information. Covers making watches and clocks from a European perspective using European methods. It seems to me that it leans a little more towards watchmaking than clock making. Old enough to be a good repository of simple old style techniques but still new enough to be easily understood. Loads of clear illustrations on almost every page will leave you thinking ""So that's how they did it"" time and time again. I am a watch and clock repairman and Of my collection of over 150 Clock and watch books, This is in my top five favorite books."
1,"Satan rules,Hal...","Having finished my daily Black Mass I'm now turning over to review this very important book:indeed one must agree with the author,the'occult'is very,very dangerous for 'Christians'-by 'occult'here I mean reason,intelligence,knowledge.Those who thought that Satan might be extinct can find strong evidence to the contrary here.All in all,this must be one of the funniest books of the century!"
1,What a Ride...!,"Man, what an entertaining book! And in case you're looking, here you'll find the illustrations to it: Wayne Douglas Barlowe's ""Inferno"". Looks great, doesn't it? And for die-hards, this is the soundtrack: ""Antichrist Superstar"" from Marilyn Manson. ""You built me up with your wishing hell, I didn't have to sell you...""People who write and read this stuff are lucky in a way. Must be like being a ""Lord of the Rings""-Fan, convinced of living in Middle-Earth. Groovy!Anybody know if there's a sequel? Or a video game...?---And just to make sure: What a sick and sad fabrication. Shame on you, Carole C. Carlson, to so unblushingly feed of the fears and selfish prejudices of your readers!"
1,Satan Is Alive And Well And Living On Planet Earth...huh Hal,The book is so depressing I could barely read it.You have to read it with a truck load of salt to keep it from making youwant to leave the planet all together!The only evidence of Satan seems to be the money hungrypreachers who feed on people's fear while they live inmansions and make millions at your expense.We have to give up the notion of all engulfing evil in order tofind and see the goodness in the world to make it a better place.Until we are able to do this we will be running to thebookstore to get the latest doom book to feed our fears.
1,Think Less Literally and More Mythically.,Lucifer can be defined in many ways...1) A supernatural being of evil. 2) The destroyer of worlds and bringer of light and fire. 3) A fallen angel. 4) A mythical figure used to generate fear for the purposes of religious conversion and control. 5) A celestial body such as a comet or meteor which fell to earth thousands of years ago causing widespread death and destruction... leading to a whole body of myth about an evil entity being cast down from heaven. 6) A mythical figure with positive attributes: The destroyer of illusion and bringer of enlightenment.
5,Astonishingly put together.,"I couldn't begin to explain how amazing this book is. Hal Lindsay is very blessed.I dare anyone who isn't a believer in Christ to read ""SATAN IS ALIVE AND WELL ON PLANET EARTH"" , from beginning to end."
2,"Odd design, disappointing","Overall, I was disappointed with the Stokke Sleepi Bumper. I purchased this (and paid a premium) to have the Stokke-brand accessory with the expectation it would complement my existing Stokke crib and mattress set. I can't imagine why, but the bumper didn't fit the Stokke mattress. The bumper has straps that must go under the mattress, but they're too short to allow the bumper to sit on top of the mattress. As a result, the bumper has to squeeze between the mattress and crib sides making it bunch up. In addition, the bumper is too short to tie on the top of the rails and it's a very soft material, so it slides down and bags on top of the mattress, providing no buffer for the crib rails. The color and fabric are both classic and lovely, but this bumper just doesn't function as well as others I've seen."
5,For my grandson,I bought this as a present for my Grandson. The only evaluation I can make that it gave me a tremendeous pleasure to see him enjoy it.
3,Straight-forward Murder Mystery,"This book has been on my shelf for more than a year. My mother-in-law had given it to me and I just hadn't gotten around to reading it yet. But I'm glad I finally did. (I noticed it is out-of-print now). The plot is fairly straight-forward with the sleuth this time, a practicing pharmacist. The pharmacy scenes are very realistic based on my own experience working in similar settings. Also, I have spent some time in Scottsdale and Tuscon and so felt comfortable with the realism. The mystery itself seemed to me to be somewhat predictable, though I won't give away any plot points. Worth the read, especially for the pharmacy angle."
1,Stay away,"I gave this pan one star because it has a nice look to it. The first time I used it at medium heat the food stuck to the pan. I said to myself this is impossible, so a second try and again the food stuck, this is again on medium heat and using a little oil. This might be the worst non stick pan ever!!"
5,Great nursing pillow,"I had a hard time figuring out how to get my daughter comfortable and nurse when she was born, until my husband came home with ""my brest friend nursing pillow"". It made nursing so much easier. My daughter is weaning herself now, but she was able to use the pillow for a little over a year. This pillow worked for me, despite the fact that when I started I was significantly overweight. As I lost the excess weight, I was able to tighten the pillow into a secure fit.I love the fact that the pillow cover is removable, so that you can wash it. I love the pocket to hold burp rags (or TV remotes)."
5,"Great product, but purchase a boppy as well.","This was the first and only nursing pillow I intended to buy when I had my daughter.The pros are:1) You can strap the pillow around your body and walk around (with one arm supporting the front of the pillow) if need be. I'm not suggesting to be reckless while wearing this pillow, but the option to have one hand free is available. (I could not put my daughter down for 2 months, so it was wonderful to be able to have an extra hand)2) The pillow has little cushion type bumps built into the pillow beneath each breast; it helps to position baby's head in line with the nipple.While this product was beneficial to me in so many ways (including sitting down to have a meal with my husband), I have used a boppy for bedtime nursing SO much more. The boppy is so much softer and therefore lends itself better to sit in a regular couch chair or rocker/glider."
5,Best live cd ever,"I don't usually like live albums because the balance between vocals and instruments is usually off or sounds strange, but this is the single best one that I've ever heard. The choice of songs was great, combining the best of all their albums with a couple praise songs, and the intensity of the audience and atmosphere adds so much. Just listening to the first song, Unite, as loud as you can is guaranteed to pump you up and the rest of the cd doesn't let you down at all. Hardcore lyrics, great music, Supertones rock!!!"
4,"Funky Lowlives, The - Cartouche","The Funky Lowlives finally release their debut album, Cartouche, after a slew of great singles and remixes. And it's both exactly what I expected and nothing at all like what I expected. Sure, the Latin rhythms and Brazilian influences are there, but the album as a whole is also much more mellow than I had expected -- and that's not a bad thing. Clare Szembek's soft vocals on ""Breathless"" and ""Irreplaceable"" give those tracks a romanticism that's startling. A few tracks (""Urban Illusion"" with its own low-key rap and the percussive workout ""Cumagain"") pitch the tempo up a bit, but more often than not, you're in for a mellow evening. And that's perfectly fine with me."
2,Eh...,"I first heard of the Funky Lowlives from Groove Salad. Their song ""Stay"" was very ""Zero 7ish,"" and since I love Zero 7, I immediately purchased the entire CD. In retrospect, I wish I had listened to more of their songs before purchasing the entire CD. I love ""Stay"" and it is definitely in my top ten of all times, however, the rest of the CD left me wanting. As another reviewer wrote, they are definitely inconsistent, and that makes me sad. I am glad I bought ""Stay,"" but I could have happily lived without the rest of it."
5,O Rey!,"Roberto Carlos 'e o Rey de MPB (Roberto Carols is the King of Musica Popular de Brasil).Smooth, romantic, beautiful songs, in either Portuguese or Spanish. I recommend any of his discs."
4,On the Mormon Frontier,The book is wonderful and came in good time and in good shape but it was a bit misrepresented by the seller - the seller did not indicate that it was only book 1 of 2 volumes.lida
4,above average Turtledoves - 3 Alternate time line stories,"In the title Novella the Mediterranean is cut off from the Atlantic and is thus a below sea level depression like the Dead Sea. Turtledove's hero, a biologist, acting as expedition chief and National Park Ranger, has to solve a deadly puzzle against time. There are two other stories (Wheels of If and Pugnacious Peacemaker) about a Norse American timeline and a US DA who is translated to it. Usual Turtledove characters, if you liked the Fox, you will like these, if you haven't read an Fox book (Wisdom of the Fox, 2 in one just out) try them first."
5,Heaven in Print,"Thomas Brooks' works are among the best of Christian literature. While most of his books are out of print, we can be thankful that his great treatise, ""Heaven on Earth"" still remains. Rich in vivid language, Brooks spells out the wonders of the blessing of assurance (or acceptance with God). He blesses the reader by unfolding the glorious truths of Scripture- showing how one can obtain assurance, and how to enjoy it. In general, Brooks provides a handbook for a victorious Christian walk. His teachings are deep and practical. There is not a dull page in this book. Today, one searches through the chapters of modern Christian books for a gem to take with them. But this work, like many of the past, hold precious nuggets in every sentence. The devoted Christian will find this book an absolute treat. I did not want it to end."
4,A large set of maps,"What makes it good is that it gives a catalog of all the different maps created. The bad is that it only lists maps. I use it for map making and world building ideas, a look into other non earth worlds.Great for inpsiring writers, world builder or lovers of geofiction. Others might fine it boring."
2,overhyped,"after listening to all shall perish's debut album, im a little disapointed. song after song i notice the same boring riffs, and vocals that no one can understand. there is no melody what so ever. the drums are played WAY too fast. i recommend this cd to anyone who doesnt know what real music is."
5,A V710 must have!,"This transflash card is a must have if you own a Motorola V710. It allows you to move pictures to your PC very easily. Better yet, it allows you to move audio to the phone to use as a MP3 player. As mentioned in the other review, it comes with the SD card adapter. My laptop has a SD slot, so it doesn't get much easier to use. Buy it and be able to use more of the features of the V710. Got a great price here on Amazon with free shipping!"
5,TransFlash 256mb,I got this for my Samsung A920 cell phone. I love it. It holds about 45 songs and hundreds of pictures. The best thing is I can stick it in the SD adaptor and put that in the media card reader on my computer and transfer songs and pictures between the two. Very easy to use. It's amazing how something so small can hold so much info.
1,This seller sucks,they didn't have it in stock so they wouldn't ship it. The card I used was a gift card so i was unable to get any credit back either. I will never do business w/ Amazon or office depot again
2,died after 1 month,Very disappointed that this thing only lasted a month.Go with the cheapo brand and save some money.
3,Not much to say about solder ... because it's solder.,"It came as expected and does what it's supposed to do. It is, indeed, made in Mexico, too -- not the U.S.A. Three stars because there's nothing wrong with this product, but also nothing outstanding about it."
2,Not what was pictured,"I received this item in the mail today. Strangly enough, it was not what was pictured. The item I received was ""Made in Mexico"" and titled AlphaFry.I feel it is very important to purchase USA made items and thought this was kind of tricky.I don't appreciate the false advertisement."
2,Not item pictured,"Solder is fine, seriously though, take the time to upload a new jpeg so people don't think they're buying something made in the USA when this company has clearly outsourced their production to Mexico. Economic times is sensitive yall."
3,Made in USA???,"I love buying through Amazon but a common theme seems to be the old switcharoo. The picture clearly shows a product with ""Made In USA"" on it and guess what happens next?? The product arrives with ""Made In Mexico"" instead."
1,Awful shipping,"The item itself is very high quality and at a good price point. The shipping, however, made this literally the worst experience I have had buying things online. they charged me 70 dllars in shipping and handling, and then it did not arrive until nearly a week after I made the purchase. It was this slow despite the fact that I checked the ""2 day shipping"" option. then, when I asked for reimbursement over what I thought at the time to be a glitch in the system, they gave me a paltry 30 dollars, and left me with 40 dollars of shipping for what amazon said was only going to be about 15 dollars. Do not buy from this company. Even the smallest of hardware stores have soldering equipment, and usually, its even cheaper."
5,good,works well with my electronic soldering needs and it is very handy in the pack that it comes in for me
3,"Useful, but Annoying","This stuff has flux pre-mixed into the solder, this causes some slight yellow-ish residue on the soldered area. Not a big problem, just thought i'd note it."
2,Won't purchase again,"I didn't bother looking at the comments before purchasing...shame on me. The made in Mexico vs made in USA really irked me, so does the change in brand, even if it is just in name. This means I'm going to have to find a new MSDS. Shipping was quick but cost me almost as much as the item."
3,Not fit for the Korean Piece of Junk (Samsung LCD TVs),"Please be careful this solder is very thick for working on your Korean Piece of Junk (Samsung LCD TV). The tracks on the power board that has the blown capacitor are thin. In my rush to order I forgot to pay attention to the diameter of this solder. It is 1/16"" that is 0.0625"". You need something that is half of this about 0.032"". This is available at radio shack."
5,New Hobbist in love,"I've only been into the stained glass hobby for a couple months now, but this stuff is amazing. For other new to the hobby, the rosin core means that it already contains flux, so you don't have to use additional flux. Though you can find bulk products cheaper elsewhere online, I highly recommend this product for beginners that are just getting into the stained glass hobby."
2,Couldn't get it to melt,"I have a nice Weller iron. I had to crank it all the way to even get this stuff to melt. Once it finally did it wouldn't stick to anything. Gave it to a mechanic friend with a high powered Weller gun that could probably melt steel. We'll see if it works any better for him.Also, as others have said, it's not actually made in the states."
4,Solder is solder...i think >.>,"Despite this being mis-advertised (IE them sending Alpha-Fry *made in mexico* instead of Alphametals *made in usa*), It melts and makes a connection. not much more you can ask for =P"
1,wrong item sent! not USA,This is wrong... how can they put up this item and they send you what they feel like sending you! they sent me one that was made in mexico Alphafry when I paid more for the Alphametals! if that was the case i would of paid for the less one.
3,good,i dont know if it is my poor soldering ability or the product but it is difficult to get it to stick to the appropriate parts
4,Good product,This is a good product for run of the mill electronics needs. I found it to be a good solder for replacing capacitors and anchoring to the systems board.
5,"Hook, line, and sinker!!!","This is simply one of the best, most well written books I have ever read---on any subject! My highest compliment is that I wish it had gone on and on. If Mr. Burke decides to write another book, I shall be the first in line to purchase it. Great job, Monte!"
5,COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN~!~,"WOW! What an awesome story! This was an amazing, riveting, and insightful book. I did not want the story to end! I have been tournament fishing for years now and this has been a delightful look into the hunt for the world record. I was enriched by the way Monte made me feel as if I had known these anglers and it was as if I had been right there! This is a MUST HAVE for anyone who is passionate about Bass fishing! A+++++"
5,Sowbelly: The Obsessive Quest for the World Record Largemouth Bass,"Even if your not a fisherman, this is a interesting and intriguing story of adventure and the real sacrifice of a select few truly dedicated indaviduals."
1,used item but said new item,i got a damaged item that was meant to be a new item. it was written on by marks on both sides of the item and it was bent when we got it so don't believe that this item is good b/c its not now i don't know what to do this missed up item that i bought :(
5,One Scary Book,"Amanda Conklin's summer is supposed to be a fun one. Her family rented a summerhouse in the beautiful beach town of Seahaven. She can see the ocean from her house so she expects sun, fun, swimming and.... Summer School too! Why? She failed Algebra class last year so she has to be in summer school. YUK, at least there is a cute boy in her class named Dave.Amanda has a younger brother and sister who need to have a ""mother's helper"" while she is in summer school. So her parents hire a pretty, sweet girl from the neighborhood named Chrissy. Everybody in Amanda's family loves Chrissy, except Amanda's cat and two birds. And Amanda! Something is wrong with this ""perfect"" little helper.Strange things start to happen...people start to get hurt and some may even die. Who can protect Amanda from the evil that has come this summer? Amanda knows that everyone and everything that learns the truth about Chrissy are dead or are dying...is she, Dave and her pet's next?"
1,Too thin,I received this sleeping bag and was very disapointed. When I think of a sleeping bag I think of something that has some padding. This sleeping bag has none. It is basically a fleece zippered blanket. It would be great on top of a padded sleeping surface but by itself it will provide no comfort. I am returning it.
4,Great router for the price,This is a good router for the price. I bought this to replace my old Linksys router which was no longer compatiable with my new DSL (neither Linksys or Bellsouth could figure out the problem). I hooked up the Belkin router and it works great. I have used Belkin in the past and as a PC consultant would recommend their products to my clients looking for less expensive equipment (especially with the recent $40 rebare on this one). The setup guide was also very basic which is great for beginners. I cannot comment on their tech support since I have not had a reason to call them :)
2,Unreliable,I've had this router in its previous incarnation for about 18 months. I've finally gotten fed up and I'm replacing it. It constantly needs to be rebooted and it's a total pain. I echo all of the other negative reviews here. Next time I'm buying Linksys.
5,Easy setup!,I had absolutely no problems what-so-ever setting up this router on my network. The step-by-step wizard guides you through each step of the way and it worked on the first try without any additional work! I highly recommend this router for any amatuer who may be interested in setting up a small network or for sharing your web connection with multiple computers.
2,get a linksys!,"My Belkin wireless router has a poor signal. My neighbor has a linksys wireless router with a very strong signal. In fact, while sitting just about anywhere in my house, their signal is stronger than mine. Their signal is also MUCH more stable than mine. I lose my connection momentarily every couple of minutes. Sometimes the signal does not come back and I need to reset my router. My neighbors router has a rock solid signal, so I usually use their signal. Both routers cost the same. I should have bought the linksys."
1,Bad Router - Worse Support,"Router:- There is no option to change default administration port (80).- You can enable remote administration on port 80 and also configure a virtual web server to run on port 80.- Unchecking Virtual Server checkbox won't disable.- Password change doesn't take effect until you restore factory defaults and then set your password.- Gives ""Invalid File Format"" error when you upload firmware - even if you download it 100 times.Customer Support:- Called Customer Support few times - call was connected somewhere in India - they were having hard time trying to understand what is port 80- They asked me to change my web-server port because it cost them too much to make port changing configurable"
1,Do not buy,I received the router and tried to install it. I got up to the point where the router was to verify the connection and I lost my internet connection. I then found out that it deleted my IP address. Called Belkin tech support with a sad result. Bottom line is that I lost My IP address 3 times. Had to go to my server to restore it each time. Belkin tech support needs to be recycled. Talked to 12 repres. with no success. Will return this junk in a new box.
4,valuable history piece,"A good companion to this book is the recent, ""Adventures of the Orgasmatron"" by Christopher Turner. I think a reader of Reich's book might easily flounder without some understanding of the context in which it was written."
1,Keep it in a box,"Before you devote a lot of time reading his work, you ought to look up Reich's biography on Wikipedia. He was incredibly prolific and is notable for having written against Fascism and come out against Communism long before it was fashionable. He is also known for inventing the infamous ""orgone box"" and ending his days in jail for medical quackery and a remarkably incompetent defense. His work is dense and inadvertently thought provoking, but mostly manic and meaningless. It should be preserved, but not widely read."
5,Smells fresh and clean!,I have really enjoyed this liquid laundry detergent very much...smells fresh and only need to use a small amount. I will buy again!
5,American detergents suck compared to this,"If you've ever been outside the US and washed your clothes with any other detergent, you'll know what I'm talking about, in the US you options are Tide or generic, both equally bad."
3,What's the big deal?,"I ordered this after falling for fawning reviews on a website. I suppose it does what it is supposed to but it was $18 for a bottle and I could not tell a discernible difference from other local products that I use. I couldn't justify ordering it again for my HE machine. I am not saying it is not good, just saying that I couldn't tell any difference from any other product that is out there for much less money."
4,Freakbeaty,"Each song on Five Day Week Straw People drips with garage-psych gooeyness. From the opening bars of Five Day Week Straw People you know what your in for. Acid fuzz guitar licks, saturated vocal reverb, tripped out drums, booming bass guitar and upside-down sound effects. It's all here.The nine Attack tracks included are less psychedelic but more freakbeaty. Oustanding cuts include Gold Digger, Magic in the Air, Too Old, Go Your Way and Five Day Week Straw People.[DW]"
4,Five Day Week Straw People Puzzle,"When Angel Air reissued this with 9 Attack bonus tracks in 2000, the liner notes made no mention of David Montague and Guy Mascolo - the actual songwriters. They in fact hired John DuCann to play on the one-off Saga LP yet the Angel Air liner notes are mute on this. What gives John? The RPM reissue in 2007 with two bonus tracks from the same writers appears to be the definitive reissue of this whimsical pop masterpiece with good guitar oriented pop-sike and the inevitable nods to both the Kinks and the Yardbirds. Perhaps we are missing something but credit when credit is due, even in the muddy world of rock and roll."
4,Two Different Groups,"I can't put my finger on it People, but side A is sensational. It has everything from the Greatful Dead to Can Heat, but much better song writing! But Side B, it's like a different group for some reason, count to think of it, the first album of July is just about the same way sort of! Maybe it was one of those rush jobs by the Studio. I've heard that some of the members were in High School when recording this. So, I really don't know what the problem is on that folks! Another thing, don't know if this album was the 2nd one that had Sound Effects when crossing to another song. I know the Beatles was first with Sgt. Pepper and The Gods Genesis Album. Hummm, something to think about. Anyway 4 Stars because of Side B! P. S. The Dude that is saying something about Bootlegging? I'm saying about the Vinyl, the Record it's self!"
5,Great resource!,"A friend showed me this book after I mentioned to him the problem I was having located good information about women scientists, especially those who had made contributions in the field of geology. This book is a great place to start this research! Written for grades 5 and up, it provides biographical sketches of women who have made contributions in a variety of the sciences. It also includes fairly simple activities that allow students to get a taste of what it's like to work in the particular field of science. A glossary and a short bibliography make this a great resource for the shelf of any science teacher."
4,Something For the Layman,"I found this an excellent scource of information on the developement of the Electric Locomotive in North America .An overview is provided from introduction of the technology to the present day utiliisation of this form of traction .As a person with a technical background a more profound explanation of fonction would have been appreciated. I.E.Block Diagrams ,photos of rectifying diodes, and resistors used to control starting currents in D.C. locomotives . They must be, ""whoppers"" .Blessings Paul Coliton"
3,Only mediocre,"This book had plenty of facts but was ultimately disappointing. It had too many references to design features without definitions. I had to keep the Wikipedia open to know what the author was talking about.The many locomotives started to blur together and the pictures were of little help. A spreadsheet of locomotives with features, driver arrangements, and power ratings would have been a big help.Lastly, the pictures could have been improved with the help of a designer and some PhotoShop work.It's a slim volume that can be read in one sitting. It is as likely to crush your interest as fuel your desire for more research."
2,Cheaply done,"The only good thing was the english subtitles. This wasn't a novela, it was like a cheap movie. If someone doesn't know the real life story like I already did then it would really be hard to understand. They didn't tell the whole story. Just bad all the way around."
3,Information,"A Realm of Blood and TreacheryDuring the Druid War, Calastia's faithlessness almost brought disaster upon the Divine races. Today, under the despotic rule of King Virduk, the land of the Black Dragon once more threatens the peace and stability of the Scarred Lands. Greedy for land and power, Calastia has conquered or subverted all surrounding kingdoms. Virduk remains as cunning as ever, but now he is aided (some would say controlled) by his beautiful queen Geleeda who seems every bit as diabolical as her husband. Calastia: Throne of the Black Dragon shows exactly how formidable a foe this realm can be.Compatible with 3rd Edition Rules"
4,Great Storage Solution,"Great concept, but zipper could use some work.Size, shape and fabric are fantastic! But, if you fill it all the way up, you risk the zipper separating."
2,I liked it ... at first.,"When I first received my storage bag I was pleased by the way it kept it's shape and I also liked the way the zipper went around the top of the bag instead of the end which makes it easier to fill.Unfortunately the bag had a strong canvas odor that I didn't want to transfer to my blankets, so I washed it with mild soap on the gentle cycle and dried it on low. After I took it out of the dryer it had completely lost it's shape and was more like a canvas duffle bag and it was much harder to fill since the sides do not stand up on their own anymore.I do not recommend this bag."
5,An exciting read!,"I can't say enough good things about this book. It is entertaining, exciting, educational and above all a testament to why we need to respect and preserve animals."
1,More bother than its worth,"We received one of these when our first son was born, when they were all the rage. It is such a hassle! Its difficult to figure out how to insert the diapers, and then you wrap the diapers in all this plastic -- if you were feeling guilty for not using cloth diapers before, this will send you over the edge! I tell you, just get a stainless steel/aluminum waste basket with a tight closing lid. You'll save a bundle over the next few years because you won't have to buy the special Playtex bag inserts, and it stops odors just as well."
1,Poorly made,"I would not recommend getting the Diaper Genie. Once my son started solids, I had to put the Diaper Genie in the garage because of the smell. Who wants a nursery smelling of poopie diapers?"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is horrible! It doesn't work properly. I have to spin the diapers manually because all the top spinner does is cut the plastic. It cuts too close to the diaper, so it's impossible to tie up and get rid of. It does NOT keep odor out either! Too messy as well. I highly recommend you DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! Also, big diapers don't fit easily into the pail. Yuck! Go for the Diaper Dekkor, especially if you have multiples!"
1,HATED IT,"My husband and I could not get this thing to ever work properly. I heard that if you can get it to work properly it is a real must have, but over 50% of the people that I have talked to about their genie hate it and tell people not to use it. SO JUST BEWARE!"
3,Doesn't completely rid of smell,"We have been using our diaper genie for almost seven months now, and probably wouldn't use any others. It is easy to use and replace bags once you learn how. Our only problem is that when you open the lid to put in a new dity diaper, the smell comes out from the other diapers. We empty probably every other day, and we also clean it with Lysol every time we empty it, but it doesn't seem to help. It's better than taking the diaper outside every time though...you just have to plug your nose when you open it! I would still recommend it over some other brands."
2,Not the best product,"We got the diaper genie as a shower gift. It was okay the first year. Then it became a pain in the [rear] to push in the diaper and twist it for the next diaper. Many times it unraveled for the first diaper after you started a new link. Plus it started to smell. I too had sprayed lysol and cleaned it, but the smell still stunk up the room. I even changed to the toddler refill, but was not satisfied. It's okay for infant diapers but not recommended for toddlers. We needed something better for toddler diapers, so we switched to another brand. Much happier now."
2,Not worth the hassle,We purchased this for our daughter and at the beginning worked great held plenty of newborn diapers. From the beginning refills were a complete hassle and always had trouble removing the bags when the Genie was full. After several months when our daughter was on solids the smell was awful and the lid broke. So if the lid was not properly closed the room would smell like bad diapers immediately. Overall its just not worth the hassle spend more and buy something like the Diaper Dekor.
2,Special Bags Are A Waste Of Money!,"First of all, nothing completely controls the odor. Diaper pails have to be changed very regularly. The drawback for me was buying the special bags (which can be pricey) and emptying the contraption. Each time you put in a diaper, you twist the top and the diaper becomes a link in the plastic bag (like sausages in a link). When it is full, you open the bottom and remove the chain of diapers. The bag often becomes unraveled and you see how much more bag space you could have used if you just used a regular diaper pail. This was trendy in the 90's but impractical now. I recommend something that uses standard trash bags, with a triple sealed lid and an air freshener!"
1,Doesn't keep in the Odors,"I was happy to receive 2 of these at my baby shower - 1 for upstairs and 1 for down. While I was breastfeeding it worked great because the diapers were not smelly. Once my baby was on food, the diapers were smelly and I found my Diaper Genie not holding in the odors. I would walk in my baby's room and think he had a dirty diaper, when in fact it was the Diaper Genie. I don't have a problem with the refills and emptying - JUST THE ODOR! I would not recommend this to anyone and now have to find an alternative. Several co-workers told me they had the same problem and got rid of theirs, too. I tried baking soda and Lysol, but the odor will not go away."
3,Great at the beginning..BUT....,"Well, I thought this was the BEST invention ever. I registered for 2 of them. One ofr upstairs and one for downstairs. I even bought some as gifts! BUT...after about 6 months of use, the plastic absorbs the odor of the dirty diapers. No matter how many times you clean it or spray Lysol in it, it is just as stinky as ever. It is easy to use. I do not think the re-fills are expensive...they are always on sale. But, be warned that the stink does not go away. I got rid of both of mine. We know just put the diapers in plastic bags ans throw them outside in the garbage immediately. I would not recommend this product to anyone b/c it smels bad after about 6 months...and who has a potty-trainable kid at 6 months old!!!???"
1,I gave it a shot!!!,"I tried this product based on the convincing positive reviews. I am very disappointed. This thing is so hard to operate one-handed. I don't like to leave the baby on the changing table for even a second, and with this device you have to have both hands to push diaper in, and then twist. I just set the diaper half way in now & hope that I remember to push it through, and twist it when I have a spare minute, but it's a pain. I know a bunch of other mothers who also have used the genie, and were not impressed. I wish I would have taken their advice in the first place."
1,From good to awful!!!,"We really liked the diaper genie at first. It did a great job of sealing odors out . . . until the baby started eating solid foods. Now I have to open the windows every day to air out his room. The odor is so strong that it makes us gag - and we're USED to the smell!! No, we definitely would have gone with another brand if we had known this. Don't be fooled by the fact that the genie is such a popular product. They sell extra thick and scented bags for the stronger-smelling toddler's diapers, but it DOES NOT WORK and is more expensive. Once the baby starts eating solids, it's not much better than the old-fashioned open diaper pail. The genie is also too short to be convenient, unless you put it on a box. You cannot empty with one hand (while holding baby in the other)."
2,We barely even use it,"I got the diaper genie at my baby shower. I thought it was a great idea. But after the few refills that we got at the shower we never bought anymore, I just think its kinda silly to have go buy somthing to throw a dirty diaper away. So we just use our regualar trash can and we have no odor problems."
1,It just doesn't work,"I received this as a shower gift but when the time came to use it, it didn't work like they say is does. It doesn't start to twist the diapers until there is enough diapers in it to reach the bottom. Everytime you put another diaper in, the one before it untwists and they fall together. So your ""sausage"" has one huge link and several small links. I went to another type of diaper pail and gave mine to someone else."
1,This thing is sitting out on our backyard deck!,"I agree with some of the other reviews - works until you introduce food. Diaper Genie does not seal out the odors! And once this thing gets a dirty diaper placed in it - watch out everytime you open it - what a stink!! I have sprayed it with Lysol, used Clorox wipes, Febreeze, etc. nothing makes this thing smell better. My husband even left it outside to air out for several days. Didn't help at all. I can't understand why everyone is so crazy about Diaper Genie."
2,ok for infants,"Ignore all your friends and don't get on the diaper genie wagon. Use one of the other disposal systems on the market. The capacity is small (esp. when diapers are bigger with your childs age). The wide mouth d.g. is too complicated to change refills and even the basic ""twistaway"" concept when disposing of diapers is too complicated for babysitters (the d.g. usually ends up in shambles). The razor to cut away the liner when emptying dulls over time too, so you end up getting out the scissors to cut out the liner. Smell is a problem too, even w/ the new (expensive) toddler liners. Thumbs down on the DG."
5,Great Product!,"We love the diaper genie! It is very easy to use (for those who don't know, just twist the plastic after putting a diaper in, while still open. To tear the plastic, twist first, then close and turn the top). The diaper genie eliminates any smell from dirty diapers, and being white, will match any decor. It is well worth the money!"
2,doesn't work!!!,"Being a first time mom I got exited and registered for alot of things. Diaper Genie shouldn't have been on my list!!!It really doesn't make it easy, I rather use a regular trash can!!! Overall I wouldn't spend money on it."
1,Insider Posting,"I have used this product quite a bit. It IS cumbersome and it IS expensive... This is an innescessary, wasteful product."
1,Not Worth It!,"I was given this as a gift. I hate that I have to place the diaper in, then push down between the clamps, then twist just to dispose of the diaper! Then to empty the thing there is like 3-4 steps just to do that!! The Diaper Champ is much better! I went to Babies R' Us to use their Mother's Room and they even had the Diaper Champ in the changing room. The salesgirl said the Diaper Genie didn't hold alot and that's why they used the Diaper Champ cuz it was more easier and holds more diapers. The Diaper genie is not worth your time and money and refills"
2,So annoying,"This thing is sooo annoying, it took us forever to figure it out and it fills up in a second, and our baby is only 5 weeks old. I can't even begin to imagine how quickly it will fill up when the diapers start getting bigger. I'd go with something simpler and we will probably end up getting something different soon."
3,NOT QUITE A GENIE,"As a first time mom I didn't even think twice about registering for this popular item, despite some mixed reviews. Some things to consider....1) The directions leave something to be desired. Practice before the baby arrives.2) Odor won't be a problem. Just empty it regularly.3) You will go through refills QUICKLY...(especially if your husband wastes a whole package trying to figure it out like mine did).4) The refill will almost always run out in the middle of the night.My advice is to purchase something a little simpler, and just empty it daily."
5,A must get item to put on your registry!,"We are extremely happy with this product. What would we have done without it? There is absolutely no smell -- and isn't that the purpose of a product such as this. Don't look elsewhere - get this product, it will make your life much easier! (By the way, we purchased the newer version of this product which has the solid white top and not the clear see-through top.)"
1,It did not work for me either!!,Years ago when the Diaper Genie first hit the market. I was given one as a gift for my baby shower. It did not work the way I thought it would. The Genie was supposed to dispose of the diapers by sealing them so that no odor would be present. This was not the case. The smell seemed to linger in the room longer then just disposing of the diapers as normal in the trash. Also the smell that the Genie left after opening the Genie to dispose of the long tied knots of diapers was horrible. I had to clean it several times just to get the smell out. Needless to say when I had my second child and once again received one. It remained in the box and it still sits in the box after five years. I would definitely not recommend this item for new moms. Too much hassle.
2,Look for another!,"I registered for the diaper Genie when my daughter was born. I did not know of any other product out there. It is now been 6 mos and I am ready for a new product!! The diaper Genie is very stinky esp when the baby starts solids. You can never get rid of the odor. The darn thing broke the first time we tried to use it!! It has these clamps that hold the diaper in place so one can twist it. Well now I've got 2 missing (I think they fell out when it was being emptied). Needless to say mine doesn't make a poopie sausage anymore. Also, it really doesn't hold as many as I thought it would. I definately think there are better products out there."
1,good for under 12 months,"I thought that the diaper genie was the greatest to begin with. Poopie sausages, great. Now that my daughter is 16 months old the diaper genie is going to be replaced with something, anything would be better. I change the bag about every other day and let it sit outside opened for about 4 hours every week and wash /lysol every time I change take a ""poopie sausage"" out and yep, it still smells every time I open the lid. I spray lysol on top of the closed bags!!! Believe me, I have tried everything to make this work. For the first 12 months it wonderful, now it just stinks."
2,Not Practical for busy family,"I bought the diaper genie for my first child and with a second on the way, I am not going back to it. You have to open up the bottom of the pail to get the trail of individually wrapped diapers out of the pail. We ended up putting one of our own garbage bags in the diaper genie along with the special diaper genie bags (that are not cheap on their own) so that we could carry the fifteen or so diapers out to the trash can.The order was minimized from the regular trash can that we were using before, but it was definatly not worth the hassle or price of the special bags."
1,Go for the Diaper Champ Instead.......trust me!!,This product is a big waste of money and time! It is so messy and hard to handle. You practically have to put your whole arm inside the thing to get the diaper in far enough. When your ready to empty it you can never get the stupid cutter to work right. Not to mention the constant odor! I learned the hard way about the Diaper Genie. We eventually started just throwing the diapers in the trash. I would definitely recommend the Diaper Champ now that I am about to have my second child. There are no expensive refills to buy and it only takes one hand to operate. Definitely a much better product than the Diaper Genie!
4,no more smell.......,"I have used this product for my past 2 children and it is great...... there is no smell ""leakage"" into the room and the genie is really easy to use..... i find that when your the kids get about 2 it doesnt work so well anymore because the diapers are a bit large for it.... but i have tried all the other products like this and this one works the best....."
2,Stinky winky,"I bought this diaper genie about 18 months ago for my home daycare. It took me about a month to figure out how to totally use the thing( using and empting and refilling). I hate buying those darn refills all the time the money adds up quick. But, it still stunk! I would have to empty it about every other day. It is a pain to hold the full diaper genie up over the garbage bag and try to ring the opening with 20 soiled heavy diapers falling out of the bottom. Also I noticed that there was also maget flies in some of the closed off diaper. I have had the thing outside airing out more than I have been able to use it. ..."
1,Don't Believe the Hype!,"Take heed of all the negative reviews here. I wish I had! This poorly engineered product is difficult to assemble and use. The resulting plastic ""snake"" when the cartridge is full is unwieldy and hard to dispose of. It took me a long time to figure out how to use the Diaper Genie, and even longer to figure out how to change the special cartridge. The final straw was when the cartridge ran out without warning (I wish the last couple feet of plastic were another color or something), leaving me with a mess to clean up.Skip the Genie, and buy the Diaper Champ!"
1,This Stinks!,"We used the Diaper Genie with my daughter and her room constantly smelled like a Port-o-let. It was awful! When I found out I was pregnant again and would have two babies in diapers, we purchased the Diaper Genie II system. I love it! With more than twice the diapers, it contains the odors better, guests can figure it out, and since there is no twisting, the cartridge refill lasts much, much longer! The extra $10 you spend on the Diaper Genie II will be saved in cartridge refills in no time! I highly recommend the Diaper Genie II."
4,A good Idea,"As a first time mother,I decided to register for the diaper genie. I had heard many bad things about the diaper genie, but I decided I was going to try it out for myslef.I will say that I don't agree with any of the bad reviews, my sons diapers also smell, but the diaper genie doesn't. As long as you keep the lid down when you are not using it.It is very easy to refill and empty, and as long as you look for the price deals that some stores have, you can get the refills for a pretty resonable price.I am very happy with this item and I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Odor-Free Diaper Disposal,"We love the Diaper Genie. If you want an absolutely odor-free nursery, this is the diaper pail to buy. We have had no problems with ours. It is very easy to use and has lots of safety features so you can be sure your baby or toddler won't get into it. We purchased ours on the recommendation of my sister-in-law who has a 2 year old who can make some real stinkers. There is not a trace of diaper odor in his nursery. It really does work.The only bad thing I can say about the Diaper Genie is that we think the refills are priced too high. Plus we've run into problems when our local store is sold out. We recommend that if you see the refills on sale at a good price, buy at least 10. It's always better to have some on hand than to run out."
1,Who are they kidding?,"I am a mom of twin boys and like many others, had been told that a Diaper Genie was the way to go. What a waste of money! It took a while to figure our how to put it together, (as my husband is wrapped in the plastic) and the instructions were not clear. Within the week we had the boys, the diaper genie went out the door. We bought the biggest lifesaver for any new mom...The Dekor Plus. It holds a ton of diapers,(especially for twins) and you can also use it later as a trash can. The liners are a little pricy, but they last forever! I have only gone through one box refill since the birth of my sons. (they are almost 5 months)We only have to empty the pail 2-3 times a week. Not bad for double the diaper duty. And the smell? What smell? This pail is the way to go! New moms: don't even bother with the Genie."
3,Diaper Champ beats the Diaper Genie,"The first thing I wanted when I found out I was pregnant with my first was a Diaper Genie. I was so excited to use it, even though it was complicated to figure out. It did keep the smell out of baby's room--for a few months. I found it impossible to clean and remove all of the lingering smells after a while though. And, the refills are terribly expensive!I am now expecting my second, and we dumped the Genie in the (recycling, of course) trash months ago and got a Diaper Champ. The Champ is easier to use, easier to clean, and doesn't smell! Plus you can use ANY kind of regular ol' trash bags with it. It is definitely THE Champ of diaper disposal systems!"
4,Good idea,"I have to say, I like this product! The first time you use it, it is sort of hard to figure out. But if you read the instuctions you can do it in a snap! It does start to smell after a while, but I figured out if you spray it with Lysol or Clorox it will stay fresh. I like to clean it twice a month with Clorox wipes too. The only real complaint that I have is that one of the plastic holders broke off and the cutter thing won't stay on the top of the Genie anymore. I tried to super glue it, but it just broke off again. I just keep the cutter on the dresser now so that my son can't get it but I know where it is. Over all I think this is a great product and I would recommend it to any new mom."
2,P-U!,"This pail worked well when my son was breastfeeding only and in newborn or size 1 diapers. After about 3 months, the pail began to stink around the clock, even though I cleaned and disinfected it. As the diapers got bigger, changing the liner became a constant chore. I replaced the Genie with a plain old-fashioned diaper pail. Sure, I have to take out the diapers daily, but there is no stench, no two-handed twisting, and no expensive liners to buy. The use of this product was so short-lived that it simply was not worth the money. Skip it."
2,Just Wouldn't Work For Me!!,"I registered for the Diaper Genie because I heard great things and also looked at the reviews. It started to work fine for about a week or so. When I tried to put the diaper in the Genie it was very tight and when I tried to turn the top it would be hard. Everything would go good until, I was probably at the 10th or so diaper, then it just wouldn't work right after that. On several occasions my husband would say he fixed it, but the same problem would happen again. Now maybe we just had it all wrong, but I really don't think so. I don't recommend the Diaper Genie. It is now sitting in my son's room in the corner with no use out of it."
2,Broken in 5 months!!!!,"I bought this genie for my baby when she was born & it never really was all that great, but just recently the cutting mechanism broke so I threw it away, I'm sorry to say the negative reviews are right on the money with this invention. I'm going to try the diaper champ.I'm happy that there are a bunch of folks out there who love & ""can't live without"" this product, but I think there are far more people who hate it then love it. Happy mothering!!!!!(or fathering)"
2,Suckered!,"My friends and I feel we've been victims of marketing, led to believe a diaper genie is a baby item we just couldn't live without. But after 7 long months of parenting, I still don't feel like I couldn't live without it. In fact I rarely use it. For the expense and the effort of loading it and emptying the Diaper Genie, I'm happy to continue emptying our simple nursery garbage can."
2,I would have gotten something else,"As a 1st time mom- I heard ""You have to get the Diaper Genie"", so I did. Well, I've been using it for 10 months now and I wish I would have gotten a regular diaper pale. The Genie stinks- literally!! No matter how many times I clean it, it still stinks and my son's nursery always has the faint odor of dirty diapers, and it gets especially strong when his bedroom door is closed for awhile. And, when I open the lid to put another diaper in it- the smell just comes right out.Also, changing the refill and emptying it are a pain- not difficult, just another chore to do. I would just prefer to pull out a garbage bag and tie it off than go through the hassel of the Genie. Plus, the refills don't last as long as I thought the would, and the price adds up after awhile (at $5.00 each)- I think garbage bags are much cheaper. Hope this is helpful to new moms stocking their nursery!!"
5,A true Godsend!!!,"I registered for the Diaper Champ after reading the reviews on this website, and I REGRET IT!!!!!! The smell from the Diaper Champ is unbearable. Poop gets all over the dispensing mechanism unless you baby is blessed with small, clean poops. The Diaper Genie is so much better!!! No smell, and no nausea makes this product worth the $50 I spent to buy 2 of them. I wish I had registered for it in the first place."
1,Not so odor-free once baby starts solids...,"I bought the diaper genie for my second child thinking I had missed out on a great product with my first. The diaper genie was great once I figured out how to reload it and until my son started on solids. Now, when I open the door to my son's room after his nap, I can't tell if it's the diaper pail or my son that needs changing. I'm giving up on buying the expensive refills and going back to my old method of wrapping the stinky ones in a plastic bag and immediately taking them outside to the trash. This is the only method I've found that really is truly odor-free. This product is on every new mom's wish list; however, I doubt it remains on their list for their second child."
1,Didn't want it but...,"I got one for my baby shower and I figured I'd give it a try. It worked fine until we had to change the bag for the first time then my husband, who can manage to put together computers and Playstation 2s, couldn't figure out how to get the dang thing to work again. We now just use it as a garage can... don't waste your money, just buy the Diaper Champ."
1,Hated it!,I only used this thing for about a week as it always seemed too much of a struggle to actually get it to work. I then switched to a regular pail which was fine until baby started solids but then we started to have odor problems. I bought the Neat Diaper Disposal System from safety 1st and love it. We've never had an odor problem and it's easier to use.
2,Don't waste your money,"Why does everyone think you need this thing? Of course, we thought so. We have used it five or six times. We ruined two packs of refills just trying to figure out how to use it. Once we got the hang of it, we realized it's pretty useless. It does work to keep odor out I suppose, but so does a plastic bag.Just put your diaper in a plastic bag!"
1,this thing stinks!!,It smells and has a horrialbe odor and even when cleaned!!!and it holds no where near 25 full diapers!! you are better off with a trash can.!!!
1,..... product...literally!,"I generally dont offer reviews but after three weeks, I have abandoned the diaper genie. It is confusing and the refills are expensive. It is hard to throw the dirty diaper in the can in the middle of the night.Save the money and buy a regular garbage can with a foot lever. That way, if you have the baby in your hands, you dont have to put him down to discard the diaper. Use any bag you want and empty regularly to reduce the smell. Put a stick up on the lid."
3,"First time mom to be, frustrated at first...","The Diaper Genie was left behind at my parents home (it is at least 5 years old). Since I had no instructions it took me a good 15 minutes to figure out how it worked. I am thankful to one reviewer who wrote about the 7 steps involved to operate the Genie. I kept thinking the twist lid had to stay attached. In addition, I was surprised that the refills (also left behind) still had a nice perfume odor. We shall see want happens. If all else fails, I guess it can be used as a regular diaper pail!!"
1,Go with the Diaper Champ!!!,"I bought this as an extra to my diaper champ because I will soon have 2 in diapers and I don't want to empty the trash more than once (twice tops) during each week. I figured the Genie would have no smell, so I could put poopie diapers in it and wet ones in the Champ. Stick with the Champ. No odor inbetween changes and less odor when taking trash out. These are the reasons I rated this product so poorly...1. I had to read the directions to use it and I have to explain it to other people who use my nursery.2. It stinks every time I put a diaper in. The Champ only stinks when you change it (I always wrap my diapers tight!!)3. It takes 2 hands. I can put one hand on my baby and use the other one to toss the diaper with the Champ.4. I have to use their expensive refills (I bought a box of kitchen bags with 4 rolls in it at Ralphs for 4 or 5 bucks and I'm only on the second roll - My daughter is 12 months old!"
1,Who needs one more thing to take care of?,"We got this as a baby shower gift. I had registered for a regular pail but got this instead. Plus I got like 10 refills. So, the cost of the refills is no big deal. Now my son is 2.5 years old and we're only on the second package of bag insert. I mean one refill. Why? Because I have to take out the trash almost every day anyway. Why not just put the diapers there? I've got too much to do to add another contraption to take up space and need emptying. I guess it contains odors ok but if you get the really stinky diapers once a day (after infant stage) then wrap them up in the plastic grocery bags. Also, I breastfed so there was no stink until my son was eating considerable solids. I wouldn't waste my money. And I'll be selling this one in a garage sale with a dozen refills!"
1,This thing is so gross....,"I had to have one of these nasty things when I got pregnant, because all the baby showers I go to the mother always gets one. What a big waste of money. Do yourself a favor buy a cheap trash can and put a bunch of grocery bags near it. When you have a poopy diaper take it to the outside trash & save yourself the hassle. How gross is this sausage link of poop diapers anyway? Its nasty to not empty the cans at least once a day anyways. Wish I knew some of these people who rave about this waste of money, because like an idiot I registered for 5 refills & all 5 are stacked right next to this useless genie."
1,"Face It, This Product is Designed to Sell Bag Inserts","It's the age-old ""sell the razor cheap and the blades at a premium"" strategy. Moreover, it's ridiculously over-designed. The simplicity of the Diaper Champ - plus the fact that you can empty it not when the refill runs out and you have a poopy diaper in your hand, but when YOU want to (we do ours every trash day) - makes the Champ the superior product by far."
2,It stinks!,"I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but this thing does NOT keep the odor under control. I've found...that the first diaper does not wrap up like it's supposed to and the smell knocks you back every time you open the lid. This thing is more trouble than it's worth so I just wrap up poopy diapers in those diaper sacks or small plastic bags and toss them in the garbage."
1,Plastic Junk,"Do not buy this piece of junk. You need a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering to use it. And even if you can figure it out, it doesn't work all that well.Instead, buy a trash can with a lid. Trust me, you'll be happy you did."
1,Buy a regular trash can instead...,"The diaper genie is not something you should spend your money on. I emptied mine every couple days and the rotting diaper smell was awful. THE BAGS DO NOT TRAP THE ODOR. I also had a difficult time getting each diaper to seal individually. I followed the directions exactly, yet all the diapers just sank into one pile, instead of twisting individually like the ""sausage"" design pictured in the directions. Buy a small $5 trash can and recycle your plastic grocery bags - you will be so much better off!"
2,disapointed,"While I was pregnant everyone kept saying don't forget the diaper genie...I had gone through TWO of them before my daughter was even three months old! They both broke. One whith-in the first week. We thought it must be a mistake, exchanged it for another. This one lasted a little while longer, but smelled awful when you changed the bags and my husband hated using it. Then that one broke. All in all it didn't smell, but if I have to replace it every couple of months....Who needs it! I was very disapointed with the product and have since heard the same type reviews from other moms."
3,You need a PhD to operate this thing,"We are parents of a 12 week old and have battled with the Genie since we received it as a shower gift. The directions don't make sense and it is very complicated to replace the liners. UGH! Also, would it have killed the designers to make a foot pedal to lift the lid? And the two lids opening on opposite sides of the canister has made me pinch my fingers TWICE. UGH! The first two or three diapers also un-twist and they end up in the same compartment. The idea is great but the Diaper Genie needs a complete redesign."
1,Very disappointed,"I received this diaper genie for my shower. Could not figure it out. I have limited time, only purchase products that are easy and fast to use and understand. I purchased a Safety First Pail and am very pleased. Save money by using your kitchen trash bags, pail is bigger than the Genie and no odors. ..."
2,There must be alternatives. . .,"The diaper genie worked OK at first, but after some use there were some problems. First, the plastic ring that fits in the opening easily dents on the edge that fits into the refill opening. Once this happens, the refill bags easily snag and you literally have to take the thing apart to fix it. Our first genie's ring was so dented (from trying to fit it into the refill container) that the bags would no longer slide out.We replaced the first with a second genie. Still have some problems fitting the ring to the refill container. Even worse, though, is the lack of stink controll! As a baby, the poops are too bad. Watch out when they are eating solids! Holy cow. . .talk about stink. The genie does little to hold that stink in and only adds its own perfume sent to it. Change a stinky diaper at night, and the next morning, the nursery smells of perfumed poop.Generally, we now use the genie for pee'd in diapers. Poops go in a ziplock and in the trash can."
2,NIGHTMARE,I got this as a baby shower gift from a friend and we used it for a couple weeks.then I went to buy refills for it and they were expensive I would much rather do the sented bags you can get 100 of them at any dollar store.
3,Not odor-free,"This sounded like a good idea, but I am disappointed. First, changing the cartridge is tricky. My teenagers have to do it for me because I get frustrated every time. Second, the cartridges are expensive and they sell 2 sizes. If you buy the wrong one, you won't know until you have the thing apart and can't return it. Third, it isn't easy to use one-handed while holding a baby. Fourth, the liners are so thin that odors do indeed escape. It wasn't so bad when baby was on fomula only, but now that she's on solid food--- look out. The whole upstairs smells very bad. I am going to try a Diaper Champ, which uses regular trash bags (I can get higher quality trash bags, thicker than the Genie refills) and is supposedly odor-free. I'll let you know!"
2,Expensive refills!,"This product works ok. However, the refills are EXPENSIVE!!! I finally gave up using the thing because of the money I was spending on the refills. It's much cheaper just to throw the diaper away tied up in a supermarket bag. We're now expecting our second child, and I'm considering the diaper champ, because it uses regular bags. If I had to do it again, I never would have gotten this."
1,Waste of Money!,"Before purchasing the diaper genie, my husband and I had heard both, good and bad reviews about it. We decided to get it and be one of those parents who absolutely loved THE GENIE. Well, it didn't work out. Every time we turned to twist, the bag ripped, got stuck or simple didn't twist. We asked multiple people to take a look at it to make sure it wasn't USER ERROR and 5 grown adults couldn't get it to work. Took it back, thinking that it was defective and the second one was the same. In short, not once did we use the infamous diaper genie."
2,Don't waste your money!!!,"For the price of the Diaper Genie, we would have been better off getting a regular trash can! The only good thing I can say is that it is compact enough to fit in a smaller space. The bags are outrageously priced and difficult to change. There is NO odor control whatsoever. We bought separate diaper pail deodorizers and they did little to nothing to help. We dreaded changing the bags. It was very time consuming and when you took out the old ones, they start coming unwound and stinking to high heaven! Also, as the baby (and diapers) got bigger, it became increasingly difficult to fit them into the opening. We are expecting our third child and already have a Diaper Genie but we WILL NOT be using it. I would never recommend this product to ANYONE! I worked at a day care center where we had a plain, inexpensive diaper pail. It was much easier to use and locked in the smell. In one day we would FILL this diaper pail and it did not stink!"
2,Diaper Genie,"I had registered for a different disposal system and received the Diaper Genie at my shower. It worked very well for the first few months. I was later disappointed to find that the Diaper Genie did not prevent odors from coming out into the room when my child began eating rice cereal. Despite scented bags and daily removal, the smell still exists. I do not recommend purchasing or registering for the Diaper Genie. The other problem, when we have family or friends dispose of the diaper, they end up cutting the bag every single time --unless provided with directions ahead of time. I want something simple that keeps odors from containing my room! Now we simply throw the diapers in a scented bag."
4,Efficient albeit a bit complicated,"Take the time to figure out this gadget - its worth it. But a word of advice - regardless of what pail you buy, wrap up your diapers - with the wipe inside - using the velcro tabs. They smell less and are easier to dispose of. Not to mention that an open diaper is difficult to manage and unsanitary. Wrapping them up might also prevent ""getting poop on your hands"", as one reviewer bemoaned. Lastly it keeps the pail clean and odor free.We've used our genie for three years (2 kids) and it never occurred to me to wash it. When used properly the diaper never touches the pail, only the plastic."
1,Get the Diaper Champ instead!,"We have the Diaper Champ (for over 3 mths). It is the best. This past Christmas, we traveled to my folks and we purchased the Genie for us to use at their house! It sucked! It doesn't even compare to the Champ. The dial to turn and seal the diapers in the bags worked once. The rest of the time we had to lift the lid and turn it from the inside. It also is smaller and doesn't hold as many diapers as the Champ!"
2,IT CUTS DOWN ON THE SMELL BUT THAT'S IT,We got this as a shower gift... we did register for it because we heard good things about it. But i have to say to operate it is a pain in the neck. You have buy special liners for it and then when it's full take out the sausage linked diapers and put it in ANOTHER garbage bag - so your double bagging. The manual wheel you had to turn to seal each bag didnt work properly half the time and wouldn't seal the diaper correctly. Eventually it got to be too much of a hassle to use so we have stopped using it and are going to to get a Diaper champ instead. It may not seal each diaper but at least we won't have to buy special liners for it and can use a regular garbage bag.
1,Diaper Disappointment,"This product is difficult to use becuase you really need both to open and dispose of the diaper and when the baby is on the changing table, it is impossible to throw away the diaper since you need one hand on the baby. The diaper therefore sits around until you can later throw it away. The refills are also very costly and the bag needs to be changed often. The pail itseld holds no more than 20 diapers and the refills only contain enough for about 60 diapers. I have returned the product abd replaced it with the Diaper Champ by Baby Trend.I actually want to give it no stars, but the system can not read no stars so I gave it one star."
4,Quite useful but plain,"The Diaper Genie I received is not like the ones seen on the internet. Mine is a plain white one. It does not have that cute purple top. Yet, this is the only model found in B-r-Us. The top has a cutter on it for easy disposal when only partially through the roll of bags. It is a quite impressive product. We use it regularly.You must read the instructions though. I had the product in my truck and ready to take back. Before taking it into the store, I went in and reviewed the model and its instructions. Now that I know how it works, it is a great product. I do enjoy the easy to release bottom. Just hang it over the trash bag, on trash pick-up day, and drop the bottom.While I cannot say if it is better than the competition, this is a good product. It lost a star due to the confusion, and mis-match of advertised product and actual one found in the store."
2,Not useful,"Before I had our son (Christian) everyone said that we need one of these. So we got one. It was such a pain to use. In the middle of the night or with a baby who doesn't like to lay around it is not practical. Also it fills up in about a days time with a newborn and when you are barely getting sleep and all you do is feed and change the baby for the first few weeks you don't have time to take this apart and empty it and set it back up again. It might work for some people, but for us it was essentially a waste of money."
2,Tired of Diaper Genie!,"I received my diaper genie as a shower gift. I've had it for 3 months and am looking into other diaper disposal systems (i.e. diaper champ or diaper dekor). My problems with diaper genie: 1 - It is difficult to explain to others how to use it (people would push in the diaper too much and then twist it instead of stopping when the inner 'claws' have a hold of it), 2 - the cutting system is not that great (I have to use a scissor now) and 3 - the whole squishing the diaper and pushing it down is just more work than necessary! I only use diaper genie when absolutely necessary (poopy diapers, pee ones I Just put in the garbage can). In addition to this, the refills are expensive! Might be better just to use one of those step-on garbage cans - at least that can be used after your baby is out of diapers!"
5,My husbands favorite item,WE acctually have not had any of the problems previously mentioned. My husband loves it!!!! We have had no problems with smell and at 3 am I am not wanting to walk a poopy diaper to the outside can. I am very pleased (so far) with this item. Nothing could be simpler.
1,[NEW PARENTS BEWARE!!],"...There are a lot of gadget and gidgets out there that look so smart, necessary and inviting, and I think every new parent thinks they *NEED* this thing, I know I thought it was the GREATEST idea ever!! I realized it's not really worth the effort it requires. It doesn't really do what you expect it to, it's more complicated than a trash can, and not really any less stinky. My daughter is now 2 and we are expecting a son. I'm smarter this time around and I know a lot of things that I really do not need...and Diaper Genie is definately something that is unnecessary...."
2,Where's the Stink?,"This started out fine but did not contain the stink later on. Husband hated the refills and was more trouble than it was worth. We disliked the specialized refills, the whole process of emptying the Genie and that fact that our son's room smelled horrible. I'm thinking of buying the Diaper Champ since it uses the plastic grocery bags."
3,not worth it,"This was dumb it is hard to work - I have to look at the directions everytime I empty it - and unnecessary. If you have a breastfed baby their diapers don't smell all that bad, and I just put them in the usualy trash and take them out. Definitely not worth buying."
1,Huge Waste of Money,"This is by far the worlds biggest waste of money. Who in their right mind would want to go through the hassles that this system has to offer. It's time consuming, doesn't hold many diapers, and for those of us with stinky diapers looming about its such a hassle. Walk the diaper out to the trash everyday and don't waste your money on the overpriced frills and expensive refills."
2,Not for multiples,"Mother of twins....not a good item for more than one infant..Genie keeps odors down, and was easy to use once you loaded it (sometimes tricky) but you need to by to many refills for multiples. Not cost effective for more than one infant."
1,"Not a ""must have"" item for your nursery","I put this item on my registry because I thought it was a ""must have"" item for a new parent. My husband absolutely hated the Diaper Genie and I could never seem to get the placement of the diaper right in order to seal it in it's little sausage casing. Using plastic grocery store bags in an ordinary flip top garbage pail works for me, just make sure you empty the contents of the soiled diaper into the toilet prior to putting it in the bag. I would rather make the extra trips to the garbage instead of fighting with the Diaper Genie."
4,The best thing going,"I got the original diaper genie as a shower gift 6 years ago and I have been using it with each child. My child's room is odor free. When emptying the canister, I just open up the bottom and put all the diapers in a plastic bag and take it out. No problems! I can't understand what kind of problems people are having with this. It's so easy to use. It takes only one hand so your other hand is free to hold the baby. It holds a lot of diapers and the refills last about a month or so. For those who are tearing the plastic when they twist it, try twisting the correct part. It couldn't be easier. It's a must have for any nursery. I was told that I wouldn't use it but here it is 6 years later and I wouldn't be without it. For all you who are displeased with this product, try reading the directions...that's what they're there for!!!"
1,stinks!,"By the time our son turned about 1, we had to stop putting poopy diapers in the diaper genie because the entire room would start to stink. The genie itself would still stink after being emptied unless I cleaned it out with bleach (it gets emptied at least twice a week). We have temporarily found other ways of getting rid of the poopy diapers until i decide on another pail-.... I don't recommend this product. It's a lot of trouble and expense and it does a lousy job!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I registered for and received two Diaper Genies when my son was born 8 months ago. Both are now stored in my basement, awaiting my next garage sale. Emptying this thing takes some getting used to, and the diapers can not be left in the Genie for more than a day or two because it stinks too much. The Diaper Champ is much neater and easier to use. Spend your money on the Champ instead."
1,"Diaper Champ is # 1, Diaper Genie Stinks!",Diaper Champ is better hands down! I cant beleive people gave this product good reviews! Dont waste your money! With the Genie you have to buy the refills! With the Diaper Champ you can buy your own trash bags and its saves more money and has a lot more room for diapers.
2,diaper champ is better...mom of 3 under three,This worked better then having nothing but the more I used other peoples diaper champs the mosr I disliked this product.You have to be really careful not to throw away the top ring when you use up a container of bags. It is easy to do because of the design. Without it it does not work.The garbage really stinks still and the bags are easy to rip.
2,It's not worth it!,"I used it for about a month then stopped. You're better off putting the poopy diaper in a used grocery bag, tie it up and throw it in the garbage. Same concept."
2,way too difficult!!!,"the liner was way to difficult. the whole ""turn clockwise twice"" took more time than changing my son's diaper. i don't know what i did wrong cause my diaper genie was full in one week. a friend of mine has the diaper champ. it is simple and i plan on getting one of those. the only high point to the diaper genie is that it does mask the odors, so if you can figure out the liner, it may be a good investment after all."
2,More work than it's worth,"The amount of energy required to open, spin, empty, and replace the refill plastic bag for the diaper genie was frustrating for both me and my husband. It never worked right for us.We eventually gave up and threw it away!"
1,Not all cracked up to be...,"Found this to be less than it's ""craze"" when it came out when my son was first born over 8 years ago. I'm expecting a new one. This is not one of the items I wish for. Found that the twisting between diapers constantly came undone, and found with that a blob of diapers at the bottom of the pail getting stuck. Also the odor was tremendous when opening. This item is also not cost friendly. Much more practical just to have a pail in the room and keep up with changing the kitchen style bags often. I give 5 stars to the inventor, who probably made a small fortune with an overrated gimmic."
1,What a waste of money!,"I registered for this, dispite the warnings from all the mothers I knew who had tryed one. No matter how often I emptied it,it always smelled. It was hard to use, and hard to explain how to use to older people. It doesn't hold that many diapers, the refills are expensive, and a pain to put in. Save your self a head ache and just buy a cheap pail with a lid. I finally did after 10 months of smells, and now my bathroom is breathable again. My best freind is now expecting and wants to find out for herself about the diaper genie myth, so I'm giving her mine. But I'll buy her a diaper pail."
1,The Worst Ever,"The Diaper Genie is another one of those things that you feel you can live without until you have one. I have read the instructions, set the thing up and used it three times and then it just bound up on me. I thought I was doing something wrong, but the diapers that were in the bottom were sitting as directed. I will admit that it took some time as Playtex does skimp on directions. It is not worth the money!!!"
2,Why does everyone buy this?,"The Diaper Genie is more hastle than it is worth. After two weeks of use, we caved in and bought an ordinary diaper pail which works just fine. Not only is the Genie complicated, but it is very small so needs to be emptied frequently. The refills (which are basically a long plastic bag) are outrageously over-priced. With an ordinary diaper pail, you can use regular kitchen bags, and smell is not a problem with deodorizer. What a waste of money!"
1,Waste of money,"This has expensive cartridges that you have to buy and are difficult to load and make sure they feed properly. It is challenging at best in the day and nearly impossible to change at three am.Also, isn't it nice to know that now they have WIDE opening gene so the old one is obsolete and you can no longer buy the refills for that, it is just a matter of time before this model is outdated and you won't be able to buy the cartridges and you'll have to buy the next newest Diaper Gene.I wish i had not gotten it, I ended up giving it away and buying a diaper champ, but anyone is good that just uses ordinary kitchen bags"
1,It Stinks Literally,It is a BIG WASTE OF MONEY. The Diaper genie is good for when your baby is an newborn (1-3 months) After they are 4 months there doo doo really stinks and the smell does come out a little bit even if you change it every other day. The inside gets horrible smell like something died in it. It is very hard to replace the refill. Even though they discontinued selling the original they still sell the refills for the original right next to the the wide refills. So for my baby shower I recieved the original re-fill for my wide genie. And I did not notice it untill I tried to replace it so I already opened the origianl refill and some how broke the darn thing. So right now it is in the garbage. Money down the drain.
1,Don't even bother....,"This is by far the WORST product I've ever used! I was so excited to get it b/c I heard that you had to have a diaper genie when you have a baby, but give me a break. When you twist the top, first of all, it never catches the plastic so I have to open it up and loosen the plastic myself. Then when you twist it a few times, once you open it up again to put another diaper in, the top either gets caught on the plastic or it cuts it when it's not supposed to. Three of my girlfriends threw there's out and got some of the other diaper disposals. I was very disappointed in this product. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,No better than a garbage can,"I received the Diaper Genie as a gift, but it was not all that it was cracked up to be. First of all when you load the first three or four diapers they all slip through the suggested twist and are piled together at the bottom of the pail. I often have to fight with it to open it and found out that the edges of the lid right below the button are VERY sharp. I got a pretty nasty cut on my finger. And it doesn't help on the smell either."
1,Diaper Genie FAILURE,"Horrible horrible stench--I think that anyone who is using one has not been using it for long...I have a 4 month old and an 18month old, and this thing reeks after half a day. I would not recommend it to anyone. I am throwing mine away and buying another product. I feel obligated to give it one star since I gave it 18 months to show me it could work."
1,"This product ""stinks""","Like many first time moms, I was excited to register for everything I thought was a baby necessity. I thought the diaper genie was one of those items. At first, I was enthusiastic about this gift, then reality set it. The worst thing about this product is the actual disposal mechanism. The diaper has to be in exactly the perfect position before you twist the top. If this does not happen, the next diaper you put in falls straight through, destroying the odor sealing ""sausage link"" system. The only way to end this cycle of stink is to cut the bag and start over. Other reviewers complained of odors with the genie and despite being very clean, yes, it still stinks, especially when emptying it. I wish I would have tried the diaper champ instead of the genie!"
2,Does not work for eaters!,"I thought this would be a great thing to have but after my baby started eating solids the stink escapes. I switched to toddler liners but that did not help much either. Not many diapers fit in the pail. You can never get just one diaper in the first section. No matter how many times you turn it the hanging diaper twists into the new diaper. The only thing I can say good about it, is that it is better than a plain trash can."
3,Not that great,"At first I liked the diaper genie. Then I took it out of the box. We had some trouble putting the refill things and the genie together. We had to go through the instructions over and over, then we finally decided, the instructions were stupid and we just figured it out ourselves. It works great, but it doesn't really look like hot links when it ties up. The first few get jumbled up together and after I think the fourth one it starts to look like hot links. It helps with the smell and it's easy to clean. But the refills are so expensive."
1,Save your money,"If you have a garbage can in your house, you do not need a diaper genie. I received it as a gift, so I stuck with it for a few months....having to buy the refills. Basically, my son was breast fed with multiple stools a day. Breast fed baby's stool does not smell bad enough that it has to be isolated. And even if my baby was formula fed...though their stools have a more potent smell, they don't have nearly as many per day. I haven't used it for months and he's 9months old."
5,Diaper Genie-us,"I recieved this as a gift at my baby shower, and I LOVE it! The bag is scented, but it's not to overpowering, my mom, and mother in law would have said so. I've never had it smell, and it's so easy to use!!! We give it an A+"
2,Good while it lasted!!,"I used to LOVE this thing, but don't expect it to last the whole diaper stage of your child, let alone go one to the next child. My daughter is now two and it has completely fallen apart. The lid holder for the cutting blade broke off after six months, the cover does not stay on, and when you try to load the new refil, the insert no longer fits without a struggle. Don't expect it to last long!"
2,Bad smell over time,"There are over 400 reviews here, so what can I bring to the party? Experience. Over time, the plastic in the diaper genie gradually absorbs the foul smells of its contents, so it begins to stink, empty or full. I'd say it has 2-3 months before you start noticing it, and maybe a few more before you have to decide to do something about it.Hey, this is fun: do a Google search on ""diaper genie bad"" and notice the astro-turf. The same message appears over and over in all the baby-review forums. Your friends at Playtex really want you to buy this!A brand new diaper genie, when you can figure out how to use it and to load it (both steps are really NON-intuitive), performs pretty much as advertised. The diapers are sealed in a chain of plastic bags like sausages. Emptying the thing when it is full? Catastrophe lurks at every step. Working this thing is nothing you want to do when you're tired or groggy."
1,"HATE IT, HATE IT, HATE IT!!!",This thing does NOT work like it's supposed to. There are no odors UNTIL you open the darn thing to get the diapers out and then it's horrible! The smell is literally gagging....I think it's a combination of the scented bags plus the yucky diapers but it's downright gross. Ours never cut the bags like it was supposed to and the diapers never stayed twisted half the time. I stopped using it long ago and now put our dirty diaper in ziplock sandwich bags and then in the trash. SAVE YOUR MONEY....DON'T BUY THIS...!
1,Save your money and spend it on another unit..,"We received the genie as a gift, and are really disappointed with it. First of all the smell is horrendous (even when aired out, cleaned and sprayed with lysol), it is awkward to open (who has two free hands when changing a baby?), and the sausaging system is a pain to unload from the genie (they unwind). I think the best bet would be a diaper pail, where you can put a scented garbage bag in it, and change it every two days..... save your money!"
1,I threw mine across the room one night,"This thing is HORRIBLE. It doesn't work and frankly I can't believe the people that actually like this thing. I wasted an hour one night just trying to get it to twist the diaper without tearing the bag and finally after an hour got it to work once. The next time I used it, I did exactly as I had done before and the stupid bag ripped and fell to the bottom of the container. I took it back and bought the DIAPER DEKOR. It is a FABULOUS invention and very easy to use. It works, doesn't smell up your house, and is a lot better looking anyway."
2,Not that great,We had so much trouble with this diaper pail. We could never properly install the bag refills correctly. The top part wouldn't twist to close. Not to mention when you would pick it up to change it the bottom flies open. I have had at least three girlfriends that bought this for their babies and hated it to. I recommend saving all your plastic grocery bags and tying the dirty diapers up in them. Double wrap the bad ones. Throw them in your regular trash. They get taken out more often that way anyway. Don't waste your money.
3,Better Than Nothing,"I don't know how I should review the Diaper Genie. It beats throwing diapers away in the trash can, but I've never used another brand of diaper pail. I registered for the Diaper Genie because it's such a name brand. But 4 months into this, I've run into a few problems. It's easy enough to use, but the first 2-3 diapers you drop in untwist and fall into one bag. That bottom bag can get so heavy, that you lose the ability to twist future sections. I've actually had to reach down and pull diapers out and start again. Also, while replacing a refill, a little plastic tab that secured the ""child proof"" lid broke, and now the entire top pops off with little effort. And, a plastic tab holding the bag cutter onto the lid broke off, so we lost the convenience of hanging the cutter where you can find it. I know nothing's perfect, but I think I'll go with another brand next time."
1,Waste of money,If a baby stayed in newborn diapers forever than this would be a great product. As your child grows so do the size of the diapers. I was buying more and more refills because the diaper genie filled up really quick. Save your money and throw them in your regular garbage pail.
4,Until something better comes along....use the Diaper Genie!,"You have to get the hang of this little item. I agree that the first few diapers don't stay in their little ""pods"", so you have a clump of several diapers until they're heavy enough to hit the bottom, then the subsequential diapers make their little pods just perfectly. It does fill up quickly, but it contains the odor really well. The old model (small mouth) was very stubborn and difficult to work with but this one is much easier. It's easier to get the diapers in and cut the ""links"" when it's full.Until they come up with something better, this is what I'll be using.The refills are spendy but I think they last a decent amount of time."
2,Don't buy,"I got the Diaper Genie as a shower gift with my son and we liked it. However the cost of refills adds up, and it still has a smell. With the cost of diapers and then having to buy the refills adds up. So what I decided to do is to take a trash bag and put it in the Diaper Genie instead of buy the refills and it works. It keeps the cost down and the smell is still there. We have to make sure it gets empty twice a week. My suggestion would be not to buy the Diaper Genie."
1,The Diaper Genie is not worth the hassle.,"This contraption is more hassle than it's worth. If you've never used one before, more than likely you'll need someone who has used it to show you how to put in the refill and get it to work right. Even then, I found that the smell when you empty it is just gross. Save your money and buy the scented diaper disposal bags that you can find in any grocery store in the baby section. You get 100 bags for [$$$]. I just put the stinky diaper in, tie the top and put it in the trash where it belongs. You're going to wind up putting that stinky sausage in the trash anyway. Why go through the hassle of having to empty the Diaper Genie? Yuck."
5,Tim,I don't know why people can't use this product properly. I certainly think the diaper genie is the best product on the market. I think people who don't like this product must be mechanically impaired... People love to complain about a product unless they don't have do do anything. It's a sad state in America when people expect not to ever get their hands dirty.
1,NOT Worth it!!!,"SAVE your Money!!!! It's a good idea but truly not worth it. You are better off just buying a small-medium size garbage pail with a lid.Pro: It does keep the odor from escaping and has a clean appearance.Con: Doesn't hold too many diapers, hard to assemble and hard to change the refills."
3,Not all it's cracked up to be!,"I have mixed feelings about the worth of the Diaper Genie! I have spent tons of money on refills since my son was born 11 months ago. At this time, it's pretty much worthless. Toddler diapers are far too stinky (even with the special toddler liners). I empty it every other day and it still smells when you open it. It's much easier to just bag each poopy diaper in a seperate scented sack ... and be done with it! I thought this was such a handy gadget at first but, it's really a waste of money to buy the liners!!!!!!!"
2,Works but is more complicated to use than Diaper Champ,"I have a diaper genie (gift) and the bottom line is that it works for us. However, if I had to make a purchase I would've bought a diaper champ for 3 reasons. First it would be cheaper - you have to buy special refills for the diaper genie as versus regular garbage bags in the diaper champ and 2nd the diaper genie involves 7 steps (lift pink lid, lift round lid, insert diaper, replace round lid, twist round lid, close pink lid) to get the diaper inside the diaper genie. Third, changing the refills in the diaper genie is complicated and aggravating. Heck, based on my first reason, I might just go out and buy a diaper champ as it will probably save us money in the long run."
2,Overrated,"We heard so much about the ""wonderful Diaper Genie,"" and didn't realize other options existed. It works great in that it does lock in the odors (you just have to make sure to empty it regularly instead of letting it get over full). However, we're seriously considering giving it away and purchasing one of the other brands, for several reasons. It's inconvenient to use in that it's short and needs two hands to operate. You also have to twist it five times clockwise, as opposed to just throwing the diaper in and being done with it. The refills are getting expensive; the idea of using a simple garbage bag is quite appealing at this point. Whoever advertises this product is doing a good job; I wish the other brands would step their efforts up so people like us wouldn't waste our money!"
2,Not all I hoped for,"I have two major complaints about the Diaper Genie. First, it does not keep the stink out. Actually, that's not true. It does keep the stink out as long as you don't open the lid to put a diaper in, but once you open the lid you need to run out of the room. And what good is a diaper pail if you can't stand to open it to put diapers in? (Of course, you get a double-dose of the smell when you open the bottom to empty it!) The other complaint is the special liners. I knew when I got it that it needed the separate liners, but I had no idea how quickly they would need to be refilled. I am looking for a new diaper pail now and will certainly get one that uses normal trash bags."
1,Avoid Avoid Avoid the Diaper Genie!,"1. You have to buy special bags, regular trash bags won't work.2. Replacing said bags is a hassle.3. The Genie breaks easily.4. The Genie does not control odors like you are lead to believe when buying their special bags.5. Buy a Diaper Champ, the Champ rocks!"
1,The biggest disappointment ever!!,This was the first item I put on my registry. As a first time mom it sounded like a great idea. After using it for two months I have thrown it out. It smells horrible. Having to buy the refills is a pain! Like diapers aren't expensive enough let's buy them special bags to throw them away in! I would never buy this product again. It's not worth the time or money. If you buy one I suggest a lot of air freshener too!
3,Kind of a pain...,"The diaper genie seems to be more work than it is worth. It fills up so fast and sometimes the liners rip causing problems. I am sure a more ordinary diaper waste container would be easier. It does keep out odor, which is good."
1,opt for the dekor instead,"this product was a waste of $ with our first baby. and, if someone uses it who doesn't know how to correctly twist it messes up the whole process. we have opted for the diaper dekor with our current pregnancy which has proved to be easy and stink-free. definitley worth the extra cash. we even bought two since we have a two story home."
2,Dont waste your money,My husband and I bought this product before we had our baby. I clean the diaper genie before I refill the bag. This item still stinks after a year of cleaning it. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,This thing stinks!,"The people who love the diaper genie haven't had it for very long. I thought it was great at first, too. After a period of months, however, it started to STINK! It wasn't the diapers that were so foul, it was the Genie itself. No amount of disinfecting, bleaching or deodorizing came close to touching that stink. I would strongly encourage new parents to forget this item."
2,I am returning it,I started out with the Diaper Champ - to a fault of my own I needed a new diaper pail so i decided to try the Diaper Genie. I had the old style Diaper Genie at my mothers and I liked it so I thought I would try the new and improved one. I hate it Im returning it today - u have to shove a full diaper in it until the clips catch it and then twist it - if u go to far - oh well and if u dont go far enough - shove that full dirty diaper down some more. I also think it is to short. The one star I will give it is that it did keep the odor out. The other star is for emptying it. Very easy. Overall - I'll never buy one for anyone I know. When it goes back a new Diaper Champ will replace it.
5,Best baby product ever invented!!,"The diaper genie is the best baby product ever invented! It is the best when dealing with dirty, smelly diapers. No more smelly trash cans...the diaper genie takes care of everything. It is the coolest little invention I have ever seen. I have friends who have this product, and it was the first thing I scanned when I did my baby registry. Hopefully somebody will buy it for me...I'm keeping my fingers crossed!"
3,Figure out if you really need it!!,"I received a diaper genie as a gift and it sounded great but we ended up not really needing it. We used all the time at first, then only for ""stinkys"" then quit using it altogether. For us it was just as easy to toss the diapers in the main house trash. We live in the boonies and have to take our garbage to the dump so house trash goes to the barn pretty much daily. Once your baby is mobile, you're probably not going to keep it in their room, my guys figured out how to knock it over and open it, not only gross but dangerous since there are some sharp cutting edges any averagely resourceful kid can get at. The other thing to consider, if you are even remotely environmentally concious, this thing is an environmental nightmare, not only are you encasing the dirty diapers in extra plastic, you then need another bag for the diaper ""sausage"". Essentially the diapers get wrapped in extra plastic twice."
1,Hate It!!!,"I received the Diaper Genie for my shower. When my son was first born I thought it was great, until I had to start buying the refills every other week for the outrageous price [per] refill. Its not even worth it, it doesn't eliminate odor, as soon as you open the top to put the diaper in you can smell it, its like something died in there, and no matter how much Lysol you spray or how many time you wash it out it still smells, the refills are a pain, my husband won't even change it. We are looking at the Diaper Champ, the reviews are good and you can use regular garbage bags, and I hear it holds a lot more diapers than the Genie which only holds approximately 15 diapers and needs to be emptied every other day."
1,Dump the Genie,"I reiceived two Genies from a baby shower and wound up returning them both. I did not notice how HUGE they are and they take up valuable space. I also noticed that you need to refill it often and let me tell you something. Babies go through diapers quick. Plus you have to make sure you buy the refill that pertains to the genie you have i.e. wide ring. ... I can place many diapers in one 13 gallon trash bag then silly special refills.I found the genie hard to operate and the ""wide"" openning was not very wide at all for those HUGE diapers later on."
1,Um... no,"Simply put: do yourself a favor and look for a Diaper Champ. It costs the same (or less) and does not demand you buy special bags. In fact, Target's shopping bags are the PERFECT size for a Diaper Champ. A Diaper Champ also holds any size diapers and seals out odor just as well if not better."
4,Love It!,"I read all the reviews I could on this before actually purchasing. I was a little skeptical but decided to go ahead and try it. I love it! Its is not at all hard to use, if you just read the directions thoroughly. My daughter is now 15 months old and it is still in good condition and does not have an ordor. I always sanitize it before inserting the new refill by washing it with an antibacterial cleanser and letting it dry. Lets face it. No matter what diapering system you have, it is going to have to be washed regularly to stop any odors."
1,Get one that uses regular bags,"I got this as a hand-me-down, but would never have bought it. Get one that will take regular bags, the refills are too expensive for this."
1,Piece of Crap,"Somehow I got sucked into thinking that I wouldn't be able to live without this. First of all, the bag inside is heavily perfumed, and I'm not a big fan of the smell. No, the nursery doesn't smell like poopy diapers, but I think that smelling like a Diaper Genie insert isn't exactly the greatest either. Then, I had problems when I tried to cut off the ""diaper sausage"" and broke the ring. I followed the instructions and everything, but it just didn't work, I had to use regular scissors to cut the bag off.I've decided that this really is a gimmicky piece of crap. I now use a regular trash can, give a little spritz of air freshener when needed, and I have a much simpler, happier life for it."
2,Works for 7 months and than the smell begins,"Diaper genie works good for the first 7 months because the babys poop doesn't smell too strong yet, after that the diaper genie begins the smell really bad."
4,better and cheaper,the diaper genie is great its oderless qick and most of all usefull the only problem is learnig how to use it . once you have the hang of it its easy ! its a must buy!
2,Great concept but waste of time,"I put the diaper genie since everyone should have it on their baby list. When I first looked at it, it seem a bit confusing but once I read the directions and did a couple of practice runs it was fine. Then we had Brianna. It just seem to be a double duty. First to put it in and do all that twisting and a few days later to empty the container. It was just more simple to just throw it in the trash. We usually just throw out our trash everyday anyway. This is also easier for me since I do most of her changing on a changing kit I have for my pack n play downstairs. Maybe if I changed her in her room more often it would be put to better use. I wish I had not opened it up and got rid of the box. For me it was a waste of money."
2,Not a great buy!!!,"I had registered for this prouduct when it first came out for my first child thinking how neat it was to have a garbage pail just for diapers. Once I got it home it was so hard to assemble and figuring out how to use it was a task. You have to turn it one way to hold the diapers in what I called sausage links, but if you dont turn it enough, when it comes time to empty it the little sausage links have untwisted. It was hard to empty and hard to refill, and after a while the room started to smell. I am now expecting twins and I am not considering the Diaper Genie."
2,Think Again,"I am very disappointed in the diaper genie. It was fine in the begging, I found it was not that hard to set up or even refill, for about three months. The ring that twist the bag started to get bent on the end, which made it harder and harder to use because it got so deformed that know it dose not fit. The bags are not that expensive but with the Diaper Champ you can use normal bags that you already have in your house. This was a shower gift to me, so I really didn't spend money to buy it.I wish I would have read more reviews on the Diaper Genie (and other products for that matter) before I put it on my registry because I would have ask for something else. I hope this will help someone else before making the same mistake."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"In theory, the diaper genie souds wonderful, however, it's awful. It does not function properly. It's pretty good at keeing the ordors contained, however, it's very difficult to add solied dispers to the pail and cut the film using the specially desinged cutter. After a few weeks of use, the top came off and would not go back on tightly. Unfortuantely, several of my friends also had this item on their baby registry. It's useless."
4,Not as difficult as it looks!,"After having a bad experience with an ""Odorless"" Diaper Pail, my husband and I decided to invest in a Diaper Genie despite some of the bad reviews it has received.We have found it quite easy to use despite some consumers' complaints of difficulty. It really is vitually odorless. Oh sure, it has a faint dirty diaper smell to it. But it is very slight and easily controllable with some Lysol spray.The refills last us for about three weeks with a 2yr old and a 2 month old both in diapers. The only negative is that with two kids in diapers, we have to change the diaper genie about every other day. But I think you would want to change any pail as frequently to avoid uncleanliness."
5,Smell no more! A must have for new (and old) parents.,"The only thing I was dreading about having my baby was the smell of diaper pails. The Diaper Genie whisked that fear away in the blinking of an eye. Take the soiled, dirty diaper off of baby, stick in the pail, give the lid three quick twists and the smell is sanctioned off forever and you never have to touch the diaper again. When you're ready to unload it, simply pop the bottom open, pull out the &quot;diaper sausage&quot; and toss it away. Reloading the cartridge takes about five minutes, although I have friends who are &quot;pros&quot; and can do it in about a minute and a half.The nursery never smells and I've never had to handle an actual messy diaper beyond taking them off of the baby and throwing them away.It's so easy to use that even the grandparents have one at their house for baby's visits!"
2,save your money,"Don't get this unless you are an engineer. I found it difficult to change the liners. I threw mine away and bought a Diaper Champ. I did not like buying the specific refills. On a good note, it never smelled."
2,There are probably better products...,"Be wary of any diaper pail that requires instructions and a demo by your next-door-neighbor in order to use it! After I figured it all out I found that it was a pain to fool with. Also the refills are expensive and it doesn't hold enough diapers IMO. It doesn't lock out odors either. It may have for the first week or two, but now at 3 1/2 months it SMELLS BAD. I guess the diapers have gotten stinkier. What can I say?The other thing that drives me nuts is that the first few diapers I put in after a refill change never go in correctly. No matter how many times I twist after the first diaper, the second one always pushes right through the first twist and ends up hanging in the bottom - un-sausage-linked. The only positive thing I can say is that when you do cut the links loose they are easy to dispose of in the outside garbage.You may want to save your money on this one and go with something less fru-fru."
2,Over rated,"The diaper genie is a great concept. Who likes to smell dirty diapers? Yuck. But I found it has a big design flaw. It is very hard to operate with one hand (the other holding the baby on the changing table) and after the first few diapers are inside, it is harder to turn.I now just keep ziplock baggies and grocery bags in the top drawer and wrap them after every use and put them in the main garbage. It's easier."
5,This and my swing are the best shower gifts I received.,This Diaper Genie does a great job keeping the room smelling great! My daughter is 13 days old and she is breastfed. So she has about a dozen dirty diapers a day and the Diaper Genie keeps the odor completely out of the room!
3,I can't wait until he's potty-trained!,"I (like everybody else) got the Genie as a shower gift. The directions, at first, seemed a little complicated but I quickly got into the swing of using it and became second nature. I really, really liked it until he was around a year old.My son is 2 now and we still use it -- but ours too has taken on the odor of waaaay stinky diapers. I've tried stick-ups, lysol, bleaching it and sitting it out in the sun and NOTHING has changed the smell. I only use it now when he has ick diapers and just throw the wet diapers in the garbage can.I think it's great for parents of infants, but i can't wait until my son is potty-trained!!! I considered just buying another one and throwing this stinky one out (the Diaper Genie, not my son ;P), but why? Potty training is around the corner...(my mantra...) Think I'll try the Diaper Champ next baby."
2,Does not prevent odor.,"I received the genie as a shower gift two years ago for my first child. My biggest complaint is the odor, of course babies diapers do not really smell that bad until the solid food starts. After my son started having stinky diaper I found the diaper genie awful. It contains the odor until you need to open it up to put another dirty diaper in. Then the whole room smells for a really long time. And, after empting it I would have to clean the whole thing out and air it out outside! I now find it intolerable to use and just tie dirty diapers up in plastic shopping bags and throw straight into the garbage can outside."
2,Too much work!,"I used the Diaper Genie with my first child, and absolutely WILL NOT use it with my second. It's too much of a hassle, and not worth all the effort. Emptying it is a big process, and you end up with a big, long (sausage-like) chain of wrapped dirty diapers. I used to take all of that and put it into a regular trash bag, before I could throw it all away. It does seem to hold in the odor, but that odor escapes each time the diaper genie is emptied. The razor to cut the bag never seemed to work like it was supposed to. I ended up having to just rip it with my hands many times. I would not recommend this product to anyone. ..."
5,I love my diaper genie!!!,"I have read all the reviews, and to those people who find the diaper genie difficult to use, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!This is not hard, my baby's room smells like balmex, not dirty diapers. We've started him on baby food, and the diaper genie has handled the increased smell just fine. My sister has a 2 1/2 year old that can clear a room with his dirty diapers, and their genie has taken care of things without the smell. The refills are inexpensive, and in my mind worth the price. I plan on using mine until my kid is out of diapers. If you follow the directions, this is an EASY way to handle the diaper duty."
2,Redesign needed,"I've had the diaper genie for a year now and all I can say is that it is in need of a redesign. I would like to know how to keep the first few diapers from unraveling. Once the diapers reach the bottom of the pail, the unit works fine. But those first few diapers unspin themselves the moment they go beyond the grabbing claws and the only way I've found to prevent this is to use tape. I've searched Playtex's web site for ways to prevent this and have found nothing on this obvious design flaw."
1,Waste of Money,I have heard so much hype regarding the Diaper Genie as a must have item. We have it and we don't even use ours. A waste of money as far as I am concerned. The top never turned correctly and getting the diapers out was so disgusting. We just throw the diapers with the rest of the trash. It works just as well.
1,Not worth the diapers loaded into it,"I would not recommend this diaper pail. The plastic latches on the top cover broke off after 2 months' use and we had problems fitting the refills into the container correctly. Our Diaper Genie smelled and did not correctly twist or knot the dirty diapers like described. I tossed it and used a regular trash can with a lid. If emptied frequently, it's better than this product because there's no hassle."
1,There Must Be A Better Product Out There!,"I purchased the Diaper Genie in the hopes that I would have an easy means of disposing of the diapers. Not so! First, whenever I turn the top knob, instead of twisting the plastic in to neat little budles, the plastic tears 9 times out of 10. I, then, have to pull out more plastic and try again (often several times). Maybe this is what Playtex intended: for the consumer to have to keep replenishing the plastic. Second, it is not odorless! Third, because the plastic has been continuously tearing, imagine emptying the pail. I would never purchase this product again!"
2,Not as great as I thought it would be,Found it difficult to put first refill in. Bag tends to tear. I thought it would be easier to use. You have to push a button to open the top and push the dirty diaper way down and then twist. I would prefer a product where you can just throw the diaper in and not have to be bothered handling the dirty diaper as much as you have to with this product.
2,a loving mother with a stinky diaper genie,"I was very disappointed with this product. It has to be changed at LEAST twice a week and when you do change it the smell is terrible!! Not to mention that when you get a new refill it takes forever to get the plastic to stay twisted--(I know I've twisted it at least 20 times before to get it to stay.) I do admit that it keeps the baby's room from smelling until you open it up, but other than that I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I am currently looking for another brand myself."
1,Product broke 4 weeks after we started,"After 4 weeks of using this defective product, one of the 4 clips that holds diapers in place while you twist just broke off. Needless to say, this renders the product worthless - now when I twist it doesn't ""seal"" so the diapers just fall through and smell.... This is cheap plastic and not designed well. I'm going to try the Diaper Champ now."
4,"Great Product, but MUST read instructions to operate","This did well at keeping odors at bay, in our nursery. You do need to fully read the instructions though, don't be in a hurry. Once you understand how unit works, it is easy to empty, and put refills in. Needs complete emptying every 2-3 days, and this is with a 5 month old baby, who poopies more than newborns. It controls odor on the outside, however, the inside of the Genie needs to be wiped out with anibacterial cleaner wipes, as stentch of dirty diapers is absorbed by the inside plastic. The refills for the Genie are scented, which helps to control the odor, too. My only complaint with it, is that it needs to be emptied so frequently, it only holds 12-15 size 3 diapers. But obviously, no one wants a diaper disposal unit to sit in nursery for a week! That would be unsanitary! lol! Overall a good unit, for a good price. Refills are expensive though, around $.. to $.., but we only go through about 1 refill a month, which isn't too bad."
4,Worth the money as long as you read the directions,"I got a Diaper Genie for my baby shower and I have positive and negative comments about it...more positive than not. It's easy to use as long as you read the directions. If you leave the diapers in there too long, it does smell but who wants to leave dirty diapers in a room anyways. As long as you don't wait a week to change the bags, the smell does not linger. With the ""sausage links"", the smell is kept inside. It's easy to cut the bags once you want to empty it and they just drop out the bottom. The only problem I have is getting it started. Just so long as you remember that the first 3-4 diapers you need to first place the diaper right in between the clips, then twist it 5-6 times. After then, you can go below the clips and only have to twist 3-4 times. Other than that it is a great product and I would recommend it to everyone."
1,A diaper DUD,"The diaper genie is much more hassel than it's really worth. A new parent would be better off spending their money on more diapers, wipes, or formula!"
4,"good genie, grant me 2 more wishes!","Personally, I like my diaper genie. I think that it keeps the smell down completely, my daughter has just started solids, and so far so good in the bad smell department. I empty ours every 2-3 days, and it is such a piece of cake, I couldn't imagine using an old-fashioned diaper pail. The only complaint that I have about the diaper genie is that when you have removed the 2-3 days' supply of diapers, and you tie the plastic refill off to start a new ""chain"" of diapers, if you push the first diaper too far down, it won't twist very tightly at all. You end up with like 3 or 4 diapers in there until you reach the plastic clips. Perhaps I have an issue with depth perception. Other than that, I think that this is a good product, and totally useful and helpful."
2,Stinky!,"This pail worked well when my son was breastfeeding only and in newborn or size 1 diapers. After about 3 months, the pail began to stink around the clock, even though I cleaned and disinfected it. As the diapers got bigger, changing the liner became a constant chore. I replaced the Genie with a plain old-fashioned diaper pail. Sure, I have to take out the diapers daily, but there is no stench, no two-handed twisting, and no expensive liners to buy. The use of this product was so short-lived that it simply was not worth the money. Skip it."
1,does not work at all!,l got this as a gift and it does not work as good as they say!everytime me or my husband use it the plastic where it hold the diaper when you turn it breaks all the time!!! and l sure don't have time to fix it all the time.... l don't even bother with it anymore. not so good for first time mom's.
3,Prefer the good ole garbage can!,The Diaper Genie does everything it says it will. I just happen to feel it is just one more gadget I can live without. Putting a stinky diaper in a grocery store plastic bag and putting it in the outside garbage can also works for me........
4,First time user,"I received my first Diaper Genie 4 months ago and didn't have a clue on how to use it. I eventually got the hang of it while installing my 3rd refill. The odors do stay in well and cannot be detected unless you have to open the Diaper Genie to empty it out. Overall, I'm glad that I have this instead of just a regular trash bin."
2,Do not buy!,"I was really excited when I got the Diaper Genie for a shower gift. And in the beginning when my son's diapers really weren't that bad it was great. However, once he started eating more real food and the diapers were pretty stinky it did not work. Poor guy's whole room would sometimes smell because of the Genie. I've tried cleaning it with bleach, pine sol, and Murphy's Oil (which is what Playtex recommends) but NOTHING gets rid of that smell. I'm just about to throw it out because it's so horrible. Not to mention the pain of having to buy the refills that are expensive."
2,YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT THE DIAPER GENE BELIEVE IT OR NOT!!!!,"The diaper gene was great for like the first 2-3 months when you are changing your diaper almost every hour and the trash can is to far away for you to lift your weary body and walk that direction...... but after it is really unessacary. It isnt so great that you JUST HAVE TO HAVE IT yeah it muffles the smell a little bit but so does air freshner, and to be honest my diaper gene has been sitting in my daughters room catching dust for the last 8 months because I dont want to change the liner because it is such a pain!!!! I mean cmon! Does this whole diaper disposal have to be rocket science for us tiered moms????JUST TRUST ME, YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT, spend the [money] on something else you could really use like a mancure or a new pair of shoes.... you wont be sorry."
2,Stinky,"This system is hard to change at first but then you get the hang of it. My problem was the smell after about eight months it starts to have an odor. I bleached it, sprayed it, etc. it helped a few days but still the smell is there. I am finally getting rid of it and looking for something else."
1,low quality construction,"cheap plastic parts break easily...in fact, I never used the thing. I took it out of the box and noted that the lid did not latch as stated in the guide. I turned the unit over and what appeared to be a clip from the latch fell out??? Nothing I hate more than cheap breakable plastic junk products, except maybe poopy diaper smelling cheap breakable plastic junk products like the Genie appears to be."
2,Not the dream it is supposed to be!,"I was very disappointed in the Diaper Genie. I do have an older model where the cutter was not a part of the unit itself but had to be twisted out of the top cap. Not a very safe idea as my two year old quickly discovered how to take it out herself. I am glad to see that feature has changed. However, the pail itself stinks to no end. It has been cleaned with bleach each time it was emptied and still the smell does not go away. In addition, it seems like the refill always runs out at a bad time, since there is no warning that you are getting to the end. It also seems to be designed for little people as it is so low to the floor. Mine is also broken and has been for some time, though it is still usable. Now that I am pregnant with number two I am switching to the Diaper Champ. My sister-in-law has one and raves about it!"
2,Not happy,"I received a Diaper Genie for my Baby Shower. I tried to use it but rather that it tying the bags, it tears them. Maybe I am doing something wrong, but other moms have tried and had the same problem. It has been sitting in my closet since a week after I got it."
5,Contain the stink!,"This item has by far been one of the best things we have purchased. At first it seemed a little tricky to figure out exactly how the load and unload the refills, but once you've gotten the hang of it, it become second nature. The liners have been great at keeping the diaper odor to a minimum! A must have if you care about how your house smells!"
1,Very disappointed!,"I received the Diaper Genie as a shower gift from my friends and was told I was sooo lucky to have it. I was very disappointed. I thought you could just wrap the diaper up and throw it in to be disposed of. Little did I know you had to stick your arm half way down the thing to a certain point, close the lid and the manually turn the rings until you think it's tight enough. I find it much easier to just stick the diaper in a plastic bag, tie it up and throw it in the trash.I am considering returning this along with the refills I received with it. This one, I wouldn't recommend."
2,Don't buy this,I was happy when I received one of these at my baby shower. I had heard so many good this about it and I read that it would keep the smell out of my son's room. Well my husband gets very frustrated with it and refuses to us it. Also it keeps my son's room smelling ok when it is closed but when I empty it his room fills with the smell of urine. It also has to be emptied very often and I'm thinking by the time he is in a large toddler size diaper I will be able to fit two in it. I won't even start on the price of the refills. I'm going to find another thing to put his diapers in that takes basic 13 gallon bags.
3,Better than nothing,"I find it difficult to manipulate with one hand, and like many of the reviewers have said, it does not deaden the smell very well. In fact, when we have people over we usually move it to the garage and open the windows in the baby's room for a couple of hours to air the place out. If you wait until the container is full before emptying, the baby's room will smell horrible. But if you empty it too often, you'll find you use up the bag material a lot faster as you need 8-10"" on each side for the knots.After 13 months of use, I will say all in all, it's better than nothing, but it can get smellier than San Francisco's Pier 39 when the see lions are having a bad day."
4,Works well but you must empty poop in toilet,"We have three diaper genies in our house and don't have the smell problem others mention. We do take the time to empty dirty diapers into the toilet first. We also use the new toddler refills (with green film) which has more scent than the white infant film.With two kids, we empty them at least twice a week."
2,Don't see the attraction....,"Refills are expensive, and the average newborn goes through more than one a month. My son was going through a refill every 9 days for the first 2 months. Now, he's 4 months old, and he's going through a refill every 3 weeks. Now that he's on solid food and his diapers are more stinky, it is NOT completely odor free like the box claims to be. I can definately smell baby powder scent over poop if I am near the genie. If I had to buy it over again, I would purchase the Diaper Champ."
2,Too much work,"I hate the diaper genie. I like the idea though. If you want to bend over, pop the top off, push a yucky stinky diaper into the pail, and then twist the top in the middle of the night, this product is for you. Someone should improve the idea. You should just be about to step on a pedal that opens the top and drop the diaper in. None of this bend over, push diaper all the way down, and twist top. My Diaper Genie is only about 2mts old and it no longer allows you to push the diapers down unless you take the inner top out, and it no longer cuts the plastic bags. I cut the bags with my sisscers.The diaper genie only holds about a weeks diaper for a 2mt baby. You have to empty the diaper genie from the buttom. It sucks. The refils are about 5 bucks and they only last for about 3wks, depending on your baby. Buy it if you want to waste $$$."
1,Not that great,"I received this as a shower gift when I was expecting my first child. We used it and it was ok. The plastic clip broke on the lid and the plastic holder for the cutting tool broke soon after we got it, with normal use. It is a pain to twist the bag to get the diapers to seal in the bag. I HATED buying the refill bags for this thing! It doesn't hold very many diapers so you have to change it all the time, and my husband never figured out how to change the bag. A friend of mine had a Diaper Champ and I am getting one of those this time around. With the champ, you can use one hand only and it takes regular kitchen sized garbage bags instead of a particular refill. Don't get the genie, it's a pain."
1,Don't waste you money!,Just go to the outside trash and put the yucky ones in there. The D.G. is a waste!
4,Apartment living,The diaper Genie is great for apartment dwellers whose trash disposal is a mile away. It's really helpful and it works to keep the stink masked. I change mine a couple times a week though so it doesn't get too full. I consider it one of the most useful baby items I own.
2,I hate this!,"No matter what I do, this thing still stinks. I prefer to take my daughters diapers out to the garage trash every other day or so. Don't waste your money!"
4,Not bad but read the directions!,"The Genie works just fine as long as you read the directions first. It is NOT self explanatory. The refills have lasted me three weeks and my son is Mr. Dirty Diaper. You do have to empty it every couple of days. I haven't had any problems with it breaking or not latching correctly, and I like that the lid locks (especially since I have three very nosy cats.)"
1,DIAPER GENIE WHAT A JOKE,"This WAS my most coveted, had to have items, and turned out to big the BIGGEST dissapointment. A hassle to cut and maintain it so that it worked correctly. A definite gross factor when it actually came down to it...had to HANDLE the diaper way more than I thought in order to PUSH it down the slot. YUCK...seemed to never work right during those middle of the night changings...Sent this item BACK wher it came from..."
1,"Not Worth It, Get the Neat Instead!","I got the diaper genie before my daughter was born. We used it for a while, but it was very hard (not to mention unpleasent) to push the diapers down. It really took some force. The bag constantly ripped. I always had to seperately bag messy diapers because when they got pushed down, some always ""escaped"". I finally got so annoyed with it I didn't use it any more. We got the Neat system by Safety First at my daughters christening and it is wonderful! Not nearly as much effort to get the diapers down, much nicer looking, and much better than the genie. Save your money, go with the Neat instead!"
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I got the diaper genie when my daughter was born, and since then I have warned all of my expecting friends not to buy it. What a waste of money!! At first, it really did seem to trap the diaper odors, but in emptying the diaper genie, all the trapped odors filled the room quite quickly. Emptying it was quite a process too. The blade that cuts the bag was not sharp at all, and I ended up having to use scissors every time. Also, you end up with a big long chain(kind of like sausages)of wrapped dirty diapers, which I would then have to put into a regular trash bag. It became a smelly, unpleasant task. With the price of this, plus the price of refills, I don't see why anyone would buy it. I am having my second baby next month, and have registered for the Odor-less Diaper Pail. -No dull razors, no smelly diaper chains, no refills, no problems."
1,Thought this was a must have......,"My husband and I purchased this product, thinking it was a MUST HAVE! since we were expecting our second child and our first never had such a thing. I think they concept is good, but it didn't work for us.. We took it apart and started over again from scratch reading the simple directions, or so it seemed.3x and more aggrevation later, I returned the product along with the refills that we purchased. The diapers NEVER twisted in the container correctly. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.. I would rather throw out the kitchen garbage 2x per day instead.Would also suggest maybe trying another diaper pail. Best of luck!"
1,Way to complicated,Maybe I am just goofy....I can not figure this thing out. I even had a girlfriend who had one show me how to use it and I still can't use it. It is the most complicated thing I have ever tried to use. It is currently sitting in my son's room collecting dust.Don't waste your money or your friends by putting this on your gift registry!
4,I like it,"I have a Diaper Genie and I really like mine. It took a bit of time to figure out how the bag system works (and I still can't the grandparents to use it right). There is a bit of a smell (not much), and I empty mine at least 2x per week. Most of the other parents I know use a Diaper Genie and really like theirs."
4,Love It!,"I think the people who don't like it are not using it properly. Sure, the first few diapers ""fall"" into one ""link,"" but with the third, the links are set up properly and everything is sealed. I had NO IDEA how stinky the diapers were because my husband had been in charge of everything diaper genie. I emptied it for the first time two weeks ago when my son was six months. This thing is awesome! The directions are easy to read and if properly done, no smell. You are NOT supposed to beach the pail; it will make the situation worse. When emptying it, make sure you have really tightened the top, so that it cuts easier. Only four stars because you have to work at it a bit, but I imagine that no diaper disposal system is perfect."
1,Why buy one? It is a stupid product,"I am a new mom and I was told by a friend of mine who has two babies to buy Diaper Genie. I didn't know by purchasing one of these trash cans, I was commiting to $../month worth of refills. I am serious, you can simply use a trash can if you close the dirty diapers completely (if it is a big messy one wrap it inside another bag before trashing it.) I use grocery bags. It works perfectly. No smell in our bathroom and I don't spend any money on refills. I returned my Genie after three months. Playtex was really good for returning it. From an experience mom: don't waste your money on buying something you don't need."
1,Expensive Poo Container,"When I was given this contraption for my first daughter 3 years ago I thought Wowsers so much better than those little diaper buckets! But for a single mom when the refills were out, you were doomed. 6 to 7 dollars at the time just for a refill! I hated to take the Poop Snake out too, and Heavens forbid if the plastic snagged! The smell was icky, the snake was sometimes sticky, and the price for just the refills was tricky! I would buy a pail that used common Dollar General 1 dollar scented trash bags!"
4,It gets the job done.,"I have been using the Diaper Genie for 8 months now and I think it is a great product. It does a great job of containing the odor in my son's room. People must remember that you are putting dirty diapers in it, so the odor isn't going to magically disappear. The inside of the genie can get kind of funky, but a little Lysol sprayed on the inside every time you empty it seems to do the trick. When I first started using it, I also had the problem of the first few diapers not keeping separated into their own little sausages. Then I figured out that if you leave a little piece of the first diaper(like the tape tabs)in between the clips when you twist the plastic, rather than pushing it all the way down, you don't get the big clump of diapers at the beginning. I wouldn't use anything else for disposing of my son's diapers."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"This product is a pain! The refils, fussing with installing them, the diaper sausage, the smell. It just doesn't work. You are much better off with a diaper pale by Safety First or something other than this!"
1,don't get the genie!!!,"I thought this product was a must have...boy was I wrong! The genie drove me crazy! The day it broke was a very happy day for us. Everytime I tried to change the bags I had to spend about 30 minutes going through the manual. It took my husband several attempts to get it all put together the 1st time and the 1st time we tried to put in the liners we wasted/ruined a whole container. And there's nothing worse than running out of refills and having to dash to the store. I don't even bother with a diaper pail now, I just toss diapers into plastic grocery bags, tie it off and toss it in the regular trash- or the garage trash. All in all, the genie is complicated, poorly built, and a pain!"
4,"Run, don't walk, to get this product","Diaper Genie was redesigned last year to have a wider mouth and a far superior cutter. These were great improvements on a product that I already grew to love. The criticisms in the other reviews are true, but are really insignificant given the bigger picture of what we're dealing with here. Loading the refills is trickier, but the instruction booklet has good illustrations and text. Keep it in the changing table until installation becomes second nature (and it will). The first diaper will try to untwist the plastic wrap if it is pushed down too far. Go easy on it and let the second diaper move things along. The unit is good at controlling odors, and it helps to give it a quick spritz of spray disinfectant during refills. Just don't let it get away from you. Remember what we're handling here (lol)So many baby/parenting products seem like a good idea but don't turn out to be practical (wipe warmers, crawler kneepads, etc.) This is one I'm glad every day to have."
2,Once the smell gets in it never gets out,"We used this product with our first child for over a year. While it is relatively simple to use, it is a pain to replace the bag and also expensive. Our biggest problem though is that after a year of continuous use the thing reeked and no amount of cleaning could get rid of the smell which seemed to become one with the plastic itself. It reminded me of Jerry's car on that Seinfeld episode. For this reason alone, I would not recommend this product."
2,more (technology) is NOT better,"I was reccommended this product by someone who had one when I was registering so I didn't even look at the other options. If I had I would have realized that this is way more complicated to use and doesn't hold very many soiled diapers compared to other choices. It's also a hassle and needless expenss to have to buy special cartridges for it, esspecially when you still get the smell...and I'm just starting solids now so I can only imagine! I'm going to trust the other reviews and get a diaper champ."
1,I hate this product with a PASSION,"I used the diaper genie for 2 weeks but had to throw it out. It DOES smell, especially when you're taking out a few days worth to throw away. Oh, the stench is awful. Plus you have to touch the wet smelly plastic to put into another garbage bag to throw out. I might as well have put it in a supermarket plastic bag to begin with. Just put it in, tie it up and toss away. A big waste of money!!! I can't say enough bad stuff about this nasty product."
5,The greatest invention since disposable diapers,"No more diaper stink! The Diaper Genie is a hands-down necessity if you're using disposables. Open the lid, insert dirty diaper into the scented plastic liner, twist the inner lid a few times and the Diaper Genie converts your stinky mess into a neat package - all rolled up like a string of sausages. When the Diaper Genie is full, you simply cut the liner (cutter included), tie a knot, close the lid, then remove the full ""sausage"" from the bottom. It takes more time to describe than to actually do it. Everyone I know who has a Diaper Genie absolutely loves it.One thing to watch out for - it seems like Playtex has a production/manufacturing problem, because about half of the people I know who have a DG have had to return one due to faulty cutters or other problems. ** If you get one that doesn't seem to work, take it back and get another one. It's worth the extra trip, honest."
4,good product,"I have been very happy overall with our Diaper Genie. I just have a few pros and cons to mentionCons--Refills are a little pricey- but one refill lasts me about a month which works out to less than a quarter a day. Well worth it to me.--A few times when emptying the Diaper Genie one of the clips has fallen out into the trash.--Some reviews have mentioned the problem of the diaper genie untwisting. This was a problem for me at first. Then my husband showed me the error in my usage. When you put a diaper in it should be secured by the clips, not pushed past them. Since I have used the diaper genie this way untwisting has not been an issue.Pros---Does a good job at eliminating odor.--very Convenient--easy to use"
1,Expensive and Smelly!!,I used the diaper genie with my first child and it worked okay for about a month but then it began to smell very bad even though our son's diapers didn't smell bad because he was nursed!!! It was also hard to get the diapers to twist down once it was near full capacity. It didn't store many diapers in the first place. The diaper refills were also pretty expensive. I would not recommend this product. My husband and I are expecting our second child soon and we are going to give the Diaper Champ a try.
2,Difficult to use,"When I got this as a shower gift I thought it was a great idea, but after I had to change the bag a few times I quickly changed my mind. It's not completely smell-proof and it fills up extremely fast. Having to buy special bags is obviously a pain, especially when they're not exactly easy to locate. The top mechanism is difficult to put back together when changing the refill. I think I've only gotten it right once and I've used this thing for over a year. Changing the bag takes too long so it usually goes undone and I end up using a standard pail anyway. The diaper genie prevents smells better than a standard waste pail would, but if I hadn't gotten it as a gift, I would have trashed it long ago and replaced it with a diaper disposal system that, at the very least, uses standard trash bags."
1,This thing STINKS!,"I agree with many of the reviews here. I thought I *had* to have this as a first time mother. What a waste of money! You can only use the special bags and it takes an engineering degree to put it back together when you need to replace the ""bag cartridge"". It also SMELLS! It is definately NOT odor free. I would change it every day and I could not get the smell to go away.....even after hot soapy water and bleach! Blech! I ended up taking the diapers to the kitchen trash can and if they are the poopy variety I stick it in a plastic grocery bag, tie it off before putting it in the kitchen trash...I don't have an odor problem now!"
2,Not too impressed!,"We received the Wide Opening Genie as a gift. It was a pain in the neck right from the start. The refills were a pain to figure out and we ended up wasting a large amount of the refill trying to get it working properly.(Now that we know how to use it, it is easy to work.) The refills are expensive and you end up paying a fortune to keep the Genie in ""working"" condition. My son is two months old and fills the diaper Genie up in a day or two. I can't imagine how quickly it will fill up when his diapers are bigger. In my opinion it would be nice if it were a bit bigger. I think a diaper pail that uses regular bags would be much easier to take to the trash than the stupid sausage. THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IS A PAIN!! The smell is ok and hasn't been a problem, but then again his diapers don't smell yet! I would definitely check into other diaper pail options before wasting your money on this system."
5,A Must-Have,"I recommend this to everyone! No more stinky diapers or trash bags, and the nursery never smells anymore! I now buy a Diaper Genie and 2 refills for every baby shower i go to!"
2,Get the Lysol ready...,"I was just telling a friend not to get this product. I used the Diaper Genie for my son for over a year and everytime I emptied it, you had to run for the hills from the odor OR you had to wear a gas mask and have a can of Lysol ready to spray. I agree with most reviewers - unless you have the diaper just right between the clips, it falls to the bottom and then the bag is open. If you do get it just right, it is easy to operate. Next time around, I am just getting a plain garbage can, a Stick Up to reduce odors, and will empty the bag more often. Not worth the money for the pail and the refills. And don't get me started on getting the first notch of plastic out of the refill..."
2,You don't need this type of hassle with a baby!,"EVERYONE told me how I HAD to get the diaper genie when I was pregnant with my son. It is an interesting concept, however, changing the refill is no easy task (the plastic ring warps, making it hard to put back in and the refills are expensive). When my son was a ""newborn"", it worked ""ok"" in the odor control department since he was only breastfed and his ""messy"" diapers weren't that smelly, however, now that he's 7 months old and on solid foods, you can smell the pail from the hallway when it is in his room. I tried everything under the sun to deoderze the pail, but it has an old dirty diaper smell to it constantly, even when empty. I even tried the toddler refills. Also, when we first brought him home, we went through a lot of wet diapers with him, and the genie only held so many newborn diapers, so I was emptying it every other day. Now, with size 3 diapers, I find I have to empty it every day...."
3,Could Stand Some Improvement!,"I appreciate other reviewers comments, but I am certainly not using the Diaper Genie incorrectly, and it DOES stink! Any diaper pail, if you leave it long enough, is going to smell! What I found helpful was to put a Stick-Up air freshener in the bottom and/or on the inside of the top; use one that has no scent, just neutralizes odors.The Diaper Champ is our second diaper pail and it is MUCH better. You don't have to open the lid every time you use it, so there's much less noticeable odor, plus you can use regular trash bags! I am confused as to the point a reviewer was trying to make about having to buy trash bags anyway; why does this make having to buy refills okay? You can use trash bags from the Dollar Store for the Diaper Champ!"
1,...,"I tried it, and couldn't hate it more!! Who wants to put their hand down into a diaper pail, then turn the thing to seal smell in, and later have to empty a long line of sausage-links? I had a mess every time I emptied the dumb thing.I bought the Diaper Champ instead, the best thing I ever did. It's SO easy, and no paying for special refill bags- you use your own trash bags. I HIGHLY recommend this instead!!"
5,Excellent product,"We are currently using the Diaper Genie for our 7 week old baby, and it is excellent so far. If you follow the instructions that come with the package, you should not have any problems. We haven't had any problems operating the product, with odor, or changing the refills. Another thing, the refills last longer than I expected. I am still using the refill that came with the Genie and I have been changing diapers constantly since my baby was born. I definitely recommend it."
1,There are better options...,"I was given a Genie as a gift as well as a Diaper Champ. The Genie was sort of difficult to reload, took special refills, was not always a one-handed motion (didn't always twist over the used diaper properly), was sort of low to the ground to deal with if I had baby in my arms, and needed to be emptied too soon. The Diaper Champ on the other hand takes my regular kitchen trash bags (cheaper than a genie refill), was super easy to reload, always used a one handed motion, was a bit higher off the ground and just all around easier to use. Even if you think the Genie is an easy product to use, you'll find the Champ makes the Genie suddenly appear complicated. Needless to say after 3 months of using both products we gave the Genie away to let someone else figure out if they like it. It's better than nothing at all after all."
1,Try the diaper champ instead,I tried the diaper genie at a friends house and you could smell all the old diapers when the unit was operated. So we decieded to get the diaper champ instead. The great thing is it actually works and you do not need to buy any specific refill.
1,do not waste your money,This is the worst item i have. It requires too much work and is a pain to operate. We have come to the conclusion that we need something that will keep the smell out and any one with do. The twisting just waste paper. It is hard to use and a waste of money. I wish i had never gotten one for my babyshower. I was told by several people that it is a waste of money. buyer be ware
1,Not worth it!!!,"I heard lots of stories and read lots of reviews about the diaper genie. I put it on my baby registry and just had to have it. So, after receiving it as a shower gift, I couldn't wait to use it. I enjoyed it the first few times, but found that it was becoming more of a pain and inconvenience than I needed. It filled up quickly in the first couple of days and I couldn't imagine going through the emptying process or replacing of the film all the time. I have realized that it's a lot easier and a lot less expensive to use plastic ziploc sandwich baggies or freezer storage bags, which can hold up to 6 dirty diapers, while also locking in the smell. If I had the box for the diaper genie system, I would gladly return it to the store, as I have only used it a handful of times and don't plan on using it again. The money would have been better spent on something else."
1,Waste of Money!!!,"In my opinion, this product is a huge waste of money. Sure, it's odor free until you go to empty it. If you don't empty the container outside, then your whole house will smell for hours. The refills are expensive. And it doesn't work like it is supposed to for the first few diapers inserted. I used it for my first child, but with my second child I left this thing in the basement and got the odorless diaper pail instead. I like it much better."
1,DON'T BUT-TOOOOOOOO MUCH TROUBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Please don't buy a diaper genie--I have bought two and it sucks!! It works fine but when it is time to change the refill it doesn't work the way it came when I first bought it. I can get the stupid thing to turn plus you have to stick your hand all the way down in the can and then turn it--too much trouble. Buy a diaper champ--works better
1,Wasted Money,"I absolutely HATE this thing! I don't even use it anymore. I hate it so much that I wouldn't even give it away! After reading that it was decent in Baby Bargains (my baby bible), I bought it. The cutting mechanism rarely works and it's just generally inconvenient. Spend the extra $5 on one of the competitors, I'm going to."
1,They should rename this the Diaper Gip!,"This thing is a waste of money. It fills up too fast and the refills are expensive. I recommend the Diaper Champ. You don't have to use any special bags, just regular trash bags, and it holds a lot more diapers. Stay away from the Diaper Genie. It sounds neat but it's not. It's annoying."
2,I will get a [diffrent kind]next time.,This was a nightmare to assemble. I don't like buying the refills and it fills up FAST.I broke the hinges trying to refill it the first time.I will try the ...next time - you can use your own bags. :)
4,Better than most,"After switching diaper pails twice I decided to try the Diaper Genie. I found that it was a little hard to get started and it doesn't come with any directions that are helpful, but I found that once you learned how to use it, it wasn't that hard. It keeps out smells very well. The only downfall is that you have to keep turning the cutting system and your hand gets real tired after a while. Other than that it is really worth getting if your trying to get rid of smell."
1,To expensive,"I bought this because I was told how wonderful it was, but when I started looking at costs of refills etc... I returned it. I am breastfeeding and BF soiled diapers don't really smell very strong so I saw no added value in this gadget. PLus we use both cloth and disposables and this just simply wouldn't work for us."
5,Love my Diaper Genie,"I love my Diaper Genie. We have twin girls and 2 diaper genies- one upstairs and one down, in the kitchen. We never have a problem with the smell unless the top is not closed all the way.Yes, it takes special bags but one refill lasts a long time. The company even gave us a free genie because we had twins."
4,Very Handy,"I love my diaper genie and there is no diaper odor, as long as you make sure the dirty diaper is completely twisted in its own little ""pocket"". It fills up fast and you can run out of the plastic bag without warning. Also once you start a new ""train"" of dirty diapers, it's difficult to get the first one started through correctly. Overall, I love it and am glad I own one."
1,poorly designed product,"Out of the box, literally nothing on this product has worked. The product documentation was missing, the product had to be forced to open (and clearly had been forced together during manufacturing), the trash insert deally was not installed properly ... Playtex could have only missed the mark further by failing to put the product in the box at all. On second thought, that may have been an improvement.What's truly frustrating, however, is the design of the product. While the idea is somewhat clever, it simply doesn't work that well. My main complaint: I can't easily manage it with my hands full -- which they always are when I'm changing diapers. Ultimately, I'm not willing to give up ease of use for a moderate delay in handling smelly trash."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"We purchased this for our newborn just 3 weeks ago and threw it out within the first week, it is terrible, very confusing, we even tried to use it with a new refill pack and it did not turn! I bought the Dekor pail and it is awesome highly recommed it!"
1,The negative reviews were right!!! :o(,"I agree with the other negative reviews on this item.....it stinks, literally & figuratively!!!!!!! It's just not worth the hassle!!!!!"
1,very dissatisfied.,"When I was pregnant with my first child over 7 years ago, I thought this was a necessity. I learned very quickly how inconvenient the item really was. First of all you have to use specific disposable bags with it unlike similar products that you can just use any small trash bag (which is much more convenient and economical). After attempting to stuff diapers into this unit and becomming tired of the fight in the middle of the night, I purchased a safety first model that could be used with a regular small size trash bag. I liked the safety 1st model SO much better. However, now that I am on baby number 3, I have learned that my upright step open aluminum trash can (which is sleek and stylish as well) works better than anything to hold the diapers and keeps the baby's room from the unwanted odors. It locks in any odor there may be and it is SO convenient. Hope you all learn something from this. Good luck!"
2,Not compatable with Windows media player,I was disappointed that when installed Windows media would not reconize the CD burner. I could still burn using the enclosed Nero suite but found it a real pain. If the unit does not work with the media player it should be stated upfront.
4,You can't go wrong with Perlman,"A beautiful collection of short, sweet numbers spanning a few of Itzhak Perlman's recent releases. Interestingly enough, there isn't an actual rhapsody among them, but that's of little consequence. This is a delightful album by the most highly-regarded violinist of our time. If you love Itzhak Perlman as I do, you won't be disappointed."
5,Great Deal for the Price,I searched high and low for a toddler bed for my son. I really wanted a Winnie the Pooh bed since that is the theme of my son's room. This is the only Winnie the Pooh toddler bed that I found and I was reluctant to buy it because I couldn't find any feedback on this product at all. I checked out other Delta products and decided it was worth the risk.I have been very happy with the bed thus far. The frame is metal and the headboards are plastic. A standard crib mattress fits inside (but is not included). The first time we got it set up my son grabbed his blanket and crawled in bed. This is a miracle for me since he detested his crib.The bed is supposed to hold up to 50 pounds. I don't see it lasting until he's that heavy since it's not very long. All in all it's a good transition bed and it's very reasonably priced as far as toddler beds go.
1,Piece of crap,Do not waste your money on this Chinese junk bed. Totally fell apart within a few months! Again DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!!!!
3,Pain in the butt to assemble,"The bed is cute and sturdy and the price was reasonable. However, it was a pin to put together. Many of the holes are not large enough to get the screw in and the holes don't line up. I spent a few hours on something that should have taken 30 minutes."
3,Can we have a proper review of this DVD please??,"I've just ordered this.I don't know who Lynda is but she clearly comes from a different planet!!! ;-) Anyway, she needs to look for ""The Night That Panicked America""...You are perfectly entitled to make more than one documentary about a subject! (Doh!). And it doesn't need to have anything to do with the p*ss poor and inaccurate Orson Welles radio play either - I presume this disc chronicles the great HG Wells story and discusses all its adaptations and effects on the development of science fiction. If not, then I'm sending my copy back!"
4,One of my favorites,Is true that the figure is a little off around the hair but the rest of it is ablsolutely beautiful. Totally worth the money.
3,Not that great but OK,"Lots of explotions and action but little plot. Worth the Friday nite entertainment, it also includes the famous ""blood wing"" ceremony."
5,Terrorists?,"I fell in love with this movie over 20 years ago. After finally finding it, I watched it again for the ""First Time"". A ""MUST SEE"" if you love your country and the military. It's not just amazing how it relates to the world today, better yet it gives you something to think about! The name of the movie is also a very great ""Motto"". You just have to see it for yourself."
1,Don't buy this cable,"Bought the cable thinking it was a good, inexpensive product. The colors are completely distorted, it looks worse than the component cables that came with the system, it is constantly flickering. I recommend going with the official nintendo cables. You pay more but you won't get ripped off."
1,Broken out of the box,The cables produced static and hissing in the audio and actually made the picture worse then the cables that came with the Wii (everything has a green hue). Buy at your own risk.
1,Just plain awful!,"It worked the 1st time I used the cable. I set my Wii to 480p (because that is why I bought this) and it took about a minute to register that. I tried using my Wii a second time with this cable and could only get audio, TV could not find a signal - now I am back on the original cable. This HD Link was a piece of junk!!!"
3,"Wii HD Link component cable - nice to have, not a must have","Wii HD link - a nice to have but not necessary. Might help with colors a tad, but overall not a huge change from the included composite cable. Does allow you to run 480p (only 480i available with composite) but I wouldn't call this ""HD""."
3,I thought it was a HDMI connection from the Wii,"Really its just a HD connection, changes from 480 to 720 I guess, doesn't really make a difference, hardly see any improvement vs, using the regular AV cables that came with Wii."
3,Enhanced color but not overall improved on LCD HD,"After properly connecting this component cable, the colors are clearly more defined and brighter. However, with all of my Wii games (sports and Beatles Rockband) the graphic detail does not appear in the high quality I've viewed on Xbox or other consoles. I've read that Wii is a bit behind the others in reproducing graphics, so with the component cable (normally always better than composite), you see jagged edges and squiggles where there needn't be any. So I'm not thrilled and am glad I only paid $14 for the cable."
3,WII HD Link Component Cable,"Does not make as much of a difference as I thought it would, but still noticeable. Plus, for $[...], it is worth it. The images are sharper and clearer, but just not what I thought it would be."
2,Not much better than composite.,"Connected Wii HD Link Component cable to a 40"" Sony 1080P TV. I do not notice any difference in game picture quality versus the standard composite cable that came with the Wii. Internet browsing is where minor improvement in picture quality is most noticeable but not enough to warrant buying this special cable."
2,Couldn't really see the difference,"I am using these cables on a 46"" samsung lcd 1080p and really cant see the improvments from just standard cables. I think the only improvment i can see is the controller response may be just a little quicker. But i guess all in all a wii just isn't capable of hd graphics, but really 480p isnt really hd. Main reason for purchase was to free up my standard cable input on tv."
4,A great product for the money!!!!!,"I would start out with saying that this is the first time I have liked a product so much to bother with a review.I was compleatly shocked with the little details that these cables made just on Wii Sports (all I have tried so far). I never relized that there was dimples and a red spot on the Golf game and the heavy grain pattern on the floor of bowling and the texture of the back splash in the alley!!!I have been playing these games on a 50"" HD plasma for over a year now and was floored with the changes and it being so much brighter.The only thing that kept it from being a 5 star review is the lenght of the audio cables. If you are going to run the audio to anything other than your tv you will need extentions.Bottom line: If you have the Tv to support the componet cables buy them now."
3,I wish it worked,"My Wii seems unable to provide a Component image through to the set. This is the first cable problem I've encountered with any of my products.I've read on other sites, that some Wii's seem to have a hardware difficulty with Component cables. Unfortunately mine appears to be one of them.I don't fault Amazon, or Nyko for the problem with my Wii. Thus my 3 star review, not good or bad with respect to the product. However, I do fault them for not posting a warning that there are Wii's which may be unable to use these cables.With any luck this will help warn others who may own older Wii's that there could be problems using this cable. I strongly advise a search prior to purchasing this (or ANY component) cable."
1,Flashing Dots,"This Cable Worked Fine For a Few Days, And Then red green and blue dots started flashing constantly all over the screen during games. Nyko will not respond to my emails. Seriously, how do you screw up a Piece of metal wrapped in rubber?"
2,Stray Pixels,"I have an LCD TV and hooked this cable up. However, I get tons of stray pixels on games. I don't know if it's just a cheap cable or what, but I'm returning mine and going with the official nintendo brand cable.Also, the sound cables can't be split from the video cables."
3,I see a slight improvement,"It's not night and day, but there is a slight improvement in image quality. I have a 1080p Sharp Aquos, Wii is capable of 480p max, so it's not going to look super sharp ever. I'd say save your money."
4,Good Product,The product was what the other reviews said it was. It worked well and help the graphics on my HDTV. I would recommend this over the higher priced cables.
3,Good cable but just that!,If you are expecting to improve your gaming on wii with this cable don't expect to much from this one... It works fine but you won't notice the difference to the standard cable that comes with the console....
4,Nice inexpensive upgrade,"If you've got a HDTV and a Wii this is a must buy.Improves many of the graphics.Don't expect miracles, because it only upgrades to 480p but there is still a significant difference."
5,Cable Happy,"We purchased these cables, since our friends who came over always said our Wii had a delay... well, now there is NO delay anymore, so far it has worked great, and we haven't had any problems with it!"
3,"Works, but no big difference on a rear projection TV","Now I get 480p, but can I tell the difference? No, not really. Cheaper than most other component cables."
2,It it really needed?,"The cable does what it should...connect video and audio. My only question to myself is if I really needed it.If you have a home theatre reciever that upconverts video you will, more than likely, see no difference in quality with these cables. The audio hookups are no different than the ones suplied wit the Wii so the value is where?If you don't have an upconvert option, I guess you'll see a little improvement but not much since the Wii doesn't go full high def.In short, you'll be paying an above average premium for very average to below average improvement of video quality."
2,"Functions well, poorly designed.","First off, Amazon, this isn't a game. You asked me how fun it was? It's a cord to plug the Wii into the TV. Stupid.Beside that, this cord was pretty mediocre actually. It performs the function it was designed to do, but at the same time it damaged my TV. The red plug for HD video was not made at the right diameter for the input on the TV, and when I eventually got it in, it damaged the vsync function on my television.But, it does work great for ""HD"" on the Wii. I can actually read text now!"
2,Don't know if I like this,"Purchased this item for my wii hoping that it would strengthen the graphics on my 50 inch tv and minimize any system lag. The link did its job in taking away the blurry lines at the end of images. However, in its place it left very boxy pixelations. I feel like I am playing super nintendo again. I think I would prefer the blurriness because at least I couldn't notice how poor the game resolution was. I'm going to keep using this product, however it didn't quite meet my expectations."
3,"Good cable, but why white?","This is a good, long cable, and the performance is on par with any other component cable for a Wii. The white color is completely unnecessary and only makes it stand out amongst all the other cables behind the tv. I don't know anyone who coordinates their entertainment center to match the unsightly white Wii console, but Nyko felt they should do their part to continue in the white tradition. If a big ugly white cable is the kind of thing you can't stand, you might want to look elsewhere. If you don't mind that, I recommend this cable. It works well."
3,HD Link,"The only complaint about this product is that you cant plug in the white and red cables into a stereo system. What i've done before is to plug the yellow cable to the T.V. and the others (red and white) into the stereo, which gives you a whole different sound quality than any T.V. could. That said, it's a shame i bought it."
3,HD Cables,I have not been able to get the HD Cables to work but have not figured out if the problem is the cables or my TV.
5,Perfect,"This cable do the perfect job !My Wii is a PAL version, and I use this cable to plug it on a NTSC TV, and the quality is better with this cable as the regular one."
5,Better than I expected,"Comparing the price of this cable with the official one, I almost didn't believe it was going to work perfectly. But, the first time i booted my Wii with it, the image was perfect: great video quality with no interference (there are 5 tv antennas around my apartment, so the problem with interference here is huge).It is really reinforced, the plug is golden, the white color gives a nice touch, and it came without any scratch (the box is quite resistent).I really recommmend it."
3,HD vs. SD Cables,I only have the sports package which are older games. I can't see any difference in the screen image using the HD Cables vs. the standard definition cables.
1,"Really, there is no difference going to HD on the Wii","The Wii is incredibly simplistic graphics-wise and I found no practical, perceivable improvement by using this cable. I mean, the Mii's are round stylized bodies without legs. I think my Super Nintendo had higher graphics than this. This cable is like having HD water - it just doesn't make any sense."
2,I didn't realize this only upgrades you to 480p from default 480i,"I bought this cable without doing much research so please make sure you know this before purchasing: The only upgrade this cable offers is 480p (over the standard 480i cable that ships with the Wii)! The difference between 480i and 480p is that 480p is progressive scan and 480i is interlaced. This means that all 480 lines of definition are showed at once on 480p. 480i shows you half that amount at any given time so therefore it is called interlaced. In addition component video has less signal loss than composite. This translates to a sharper image with less noise.With that said, this cable does exactly what it should do and I have no complaints with it's performance. Simply with the fact that you are nearly purchasing the same cable you already have."
1,Can't tell the difference,I cannot tell the difference even on my super duper Samsung HDTV with the proper settings. Must be a reason the price has come down on these cables. Save your money and buy a good game.
3,Lost in the transulation.....,Not a bad product but no directions as to where and how the leads are to be hooked up...
5,Wii Component Cable,Works well. Have not had any problems during the three months that I have had it. Produces slightly better quality images than the composite cables that came with the Wii.
2,Very slight improvement....,"I have a 40"" 720p Sony. The picture seemed a little sharper with these new cables, but lots of stray pixels."
3,Works as advertised...,"...but I really wish the audio connection cables were longer.I don't have a TV; I have the Wii attached to my 24"" computer monitor, and Logitech surround sound system. It's only by luck that the input ""node"" for the surround setup is right next to my monitor, and even then I had to go to Radio Shack and get RCA cable extensions, so the audio would reach.Once plugged in, it works like a champ!"
3,Never got the chance to use product,"Well I received the product as advertised. Only problem is that with my tv, there isn't a lot of room on the side of the inputs. The thickness of the parts that you plug in was too big and I couldn't manage to get it in. Probably more the fault of the design of my tv, but just be aware the plugs are a little thick on the ends, make sure you have enough room. The regular Wii cables fit fine so I guess i'll continue using those."
3,Can't quite tell if it does what it said - increase resolution,"Looks okay, supposedly allows the full resolution of the Wii = 480p - to show on your HD screen. It's tough to tell unless you do a side by side test, which is not possible, considering I don't have two Wiis or two HD TVs. But the picture is good."
2,Inferior to official Nintendo cable,"I have a high-quality projection TV system and I see a pretty significant difference between theOfficial Wii Component Video Cableand this Nyko version (I have both). The colors with the Nintendo cable are brighter and more vivid. This cable works, but I would recommend the official cable for best results."
1,Didn't work,"Plugged it in, didn't work....""no signal found"". So I ended up using the AV cord that came included with my Wii. I didn't return the HD Link because the packaging was so impossible to get into that you practically have to shred the thing with a boxcutter to get into it. A complete waste of $13."
3,haven't noticed a difference,"I really haven't noticed if my Wii looks more HD or not. It could also be my TV, which is 780 ghz (the one that's not 1080). Still works to connect the wii to the TV, in case you somehow lost all of your other cords."
2,Stopped working after six months,"I purchased this in January 2009 for my new Wii console. Since I do not use my Wii very frequently, these cables probably were used about four times. I turned on my Wii today to play, and the cables had stopped working. When I hooked up the OEM cables, the system worked. So I had to go out and buy Nintendo-branded component cables. I am pretty disappointed--while they worked, they worked wonderfully, but it would not be very fortunate for this company if their cables stopped working after six months."
5,Review for HD Link for Wii,"This is definitely worth the money. I have a 46"" HDTV and I can see a difference between the cable the Wii came with and this one. This cable cleans up the picture. You will have to change the output video settings on the Wii to 480P though. Would I recommend this to a friend? Definitely!"
2,Not much of an upgrade from standard cable.,"This is a good deal for the cable, if you need an A/V cable. For a big LCD TV, I don't think it's worth the money if the cable that came with the Wii works with your TV. It doesn't seem to make much of a difference to me. If you need another cable anyway, go for it, but the ""HD"" part of the name is obviously a sham, since the Wii does not have HD output."
3,More of a convenience than an upgrade,"Since the Wii only supports 480p resolution, these are not HD cables. I purchased them as more of a convenience because I did not have an extra composite input. I did not notice any difference in picture quality. On the plus side these cables are well built and appear to be shielded. If you can find them at a reasonable price I would upgrade and keep the original set as a spare, If you have enough composite inputs on your TV then I wouldn't bother."
3,Wii HD Link Component Cable,"Pros: Works as advertised.Cons: WHY WHY WHY do these manufacturers (this means you too, Nintendo) make the audio connections so short? As it stands, I cannot separate the R and L audio connectors from the component video without extra couplers and cables so I can hook them into my A/V receiver. This is a design oversight, and is the reason why I rated this purchase so poorly."
3,O.K. If You Can Taylor,"These shorts were way too tight at the waist and very long in the crotch. I had to cut some off the top and then put a new looser elastic on. It worked out fine for me, but maybe not every one can do that. Besides it's nice to be able to buy things and just wear them without all the added fuss."
5,One of the Best Books for Understanding the Scriptures,"I highly recommend this book. The author brings out many scriptures, and with sound reasoning, shows how they fit together, even when they may seem to conflict at first. I believe the Bible, as God's word, does harmonize, and this book helps show how."
5,Excellent book. Very comforting.,"This book is a treasure and I am so disheartened it is not available to give as gifts to my many friends who have lost loved ones. It is filled with inspiration, hope and reminders of love sustained."
5,Les Brown Plays Lerner and Loewe and Richard Rogers,"This is first a great swing band. Then the band plays great arrangements of some very fine and very familiar tunes from Camelot, My Fair Lady, Gigi. Then they play swing versions of the standards My Funny Valentine, Have You Met Miss Jones, Little Girls Blue and The Lady is a Tramp. This covers the swinging 1950's and gets into the early 1960's. I saw this band in person in 1956. They really enjoyed what they were doing. It shows in their sound."
3,"awesome, could be better, but awesome","like i said in the title, it could be better, but its awesome. especially:evolutionbitch we got a problemlove and luxury (best song on the album by far)i will protect you."
1,Head Made Korn,Without Head the band is quickly falling apart. Munky's guitar playing is only good for slow chunky riffs and with out head to lead him he is worthless. This is a boring album! Munky's creativity is non existent... if you watch one of the early Korn home videos it is stated that Head is the driving talent behind the entire guitar work....they suck without him!
1,terrible,"i used to be a big korn fan, and ever since TALITM came out ive lost all hope for them. This new album has nothing memorable on it. The choruses are the weakest on any album they've done and the guitars are more quiet and replaced by synth. Deffinate jon davis solo project going on here."
5,Korn keeps evolving,"Every Korn CD has its own unique sounds and styles. This is not a ""banger"" CD but it has some great songs and some awesome trance like bits mixed in."
3,"Some Good, Some Not So.","Korn is one of those bands that seem to constantly evolve. This is no exception. There are a few harder tracks that just seem to drive ones self. Then there are others, although seemingly bland at first listen, also at the same time, seem to grow with each subsequent playing. There are a lot more melodic tracks that have been previously released, but still in the whole of it, rather well done. I would surmise that the band has grown much more on this CD, but still retain the metal edge that has always kept Korn above and beyond any imitators."
5,"Ghostly, Hauntingly Awesome","I've been a advid KoRn fan ever since I was in middle school. This album was a enjoyable release from their usual heavy riffs and it has a definite atmospheric and almost ghostly feel to it. It's still heavy, very heavy, but even on the first track they managed to blend heavy with a haunting lull torwards the end that brings tears to my eyes. The first track on the album ""Starting Over"" has to do with the near death experience that Johnathan Davis experienced. The got Terry Bozzio to play drums on this album and he definitely gives it a little something different. I advise to get the deluxe bonus edition with the extra DVD and album work. They are down to three members and I hope to see them reunited on stage again someday. This album is a MUST BUY! Please don't illegally download KoRn's music, they worked very hard to get this album off the ground and they need your support."
1,"""Hold on..bee strong""","Don't lose faith in KoRn guys! Yes any TRUE KORN fan like me will tell youthat their last 2 albums were horrible and Take a look in the mirror was mediocre.But their new album will sound like the ""older"" KoRn that we all grew to love.Jonathan davis isn't getting into the sound, Ross Robinson (producer of Korns first 2 albums)and the rest of the band will create the sound. Even Jonathan said they are going for an old schoolsound that people can bang their heads to and go wild. Come on..have some faith, this next album should winus Solid Korn fans over again. This might be their last chance ,pleeease dont f*** it up"
5,KORN/UNTITLED & w/o David?,"Whatever to the bad reviews. They are truely not true korn fans and don't know how to listen to lyrics. Korn delivers another great album. I was surprised to see that there was no David on drums :( But it still sounds great. When I first bought this album, and popped it into my cd player, I knew I didn't like any of the songs. But around the 2nd time, I fell in love with it. Every song on there has a clear message. I expecially like the message with ""love and luxury"" haha, take that Head! My favorite song off of there is without a doubt, ""Bitch, we got a problem."" I love it. You'll fall in love with this album also if you listen to it completely. One of their bests I believe."
3,"Solid, but not Outstanding","There are a couple notable singles on this album, especially Evolution--but overall, these are not the kind of ground-breaking songs that you'll want to play for months to come. The CD is still worth getting, in my opinion, if you are a long time fan of Korn, as the songs are still enjoyable. With each new release, it seems that Jonathon Davis grows in musical and lyrical ability, so I still have hope for Korn's resurgence."
5,Untitled Korn CD/DVD is AWESOME,This is one of the best cds/dvds Korn has come out with in a while. It is solid Rock n Roll. I love it and listen to it every day. It is one continuous great song after another.
3,Not bad ... was hoping for better,"I've given this disc a few spins and while there are some standout tracks on it - Bitch We Got A Problem, Do What They Say, Love and Luxury - it's still not what I was hoping for.For some reason, Johnathan Davis and co. have taken to using a very synth sound on their discs lately and it just isn't doing anything for me. If I wanted to hear that, I'd listen to NIN and their ilk.I was so hoping this latest KoRn disc was going to find the band returning to their stripped down sound. But, alas, it appears that's not happening anytime soon. It's too bad, too, because KoRn proves on this CD that they can still write great songs, but the disc's production gets in the way."
3,not the record I was hoping for,"I really don't like this album at all. I love heavy metal but come on this is more like death metal korn instead of pure metal that i really loved like on S.Y.O.T.O.S. (see you on the other side). good album put hopefully they're new record will sound like the previous one did. great DVD totally worth watching because you get the story behind each song and that proves that the band has moved on from the Brian ""Head"" Welch situation. the old school fans should move on to."
4,Korn Untitled [Explicit],"I liked the album, but that doesn't really help you. As with any other online music purchase, take advantage of the previews and listen to part of all the songs before you decide to buy it."
3,Not bad but not great,Korn's music has changed so much recently and I don't think it has changed for the better. Overall the disc has some decent tracks but it just seems to be missing something.....
3,"It's OK, and just OK","Basiclly, I think the album is ok. However, it is still my least favorite album by korn. It's very different from their other albums, which is because (in my opinion) David and Head are not with Korn anymore. I respect the band for wanting to create a new sound, but I also kind of miss their old styles too. I think (not counting this album) Korn is divided into 3 different styles of music. This album isn't much like their first album, Life is Peachy, or Take a Look in the Mirror (one style). It is not like Follow the Leader, Issues, or Untouchables (another style). It is not like See you on the Other Side either (another style). It's VERY different.I think the album is alright, but I hope that in the future they make another album with their other styles in them, and then go back to doing other styles of music that they think of. This album isn't that heavy, or fast, not that much. I give it three stars out of five because it's a fair album."
5,Thought it was great,"A little different from previous albums, so it kinda took me back a little. But as I listened it grew on me and now I love it."
2,"head, where are you?","Since the departure of Head, Korn was never quite the same... I think the songwriting definitely took a hit since he left. It's hard to believe this is the band that once gave us Blind, Faget, A.D.I.D.A.S., Freak on a Leash, etc.... Bow out gracefully now, guys, while people still respect you..."
3,"More of the Same, and That's OK","Korn plays it safe with 'Untitled.' The songs, the rifs, the choruses, are nothing we haven't heard before. Even the bagpipe intro on the 'I Will Protect You' made me wonder if I was listening to an older album. The band can easily be criticized for not expanding their horizons or taking more chances at this point in its career (although I will criticize it for not naming the album. That's just lazy). But does that make the album bad? Hardly.'Evolution' goes into the best of Korn playlist on the Ipod. 'Kiss' and 'Hold on' will never get skipped on the song shuffle. The rest is music-to-listen-to on occasion.It's not bad, it's just a lot less than I expected. Korn isn't under any pressure to release an album every year (or in this case, two, including the Unplugged one). Take your time, Jonathan, and next time put out something that will blow us away."
3,B.... we got a problem,I only liked 4 songs on this album and thats track 2 3 4 and 5 the rest sucked a real let down to. But the tracks i just said are the best this was a dissapointment like linkin parks album minutes to midnight that album was a dissapointment to this album did'nt sound like korn a little but this album sucked.
3,koRn !!!!!!!,"come on you used to be awsome but this cd is insane the only song that is great is ""evolution"" and ""hold on"" the CDUntitledis just as horrible as ""see you on the other side"""
1,How can anyone rate this 4 or 5?,"I couldn't wait to get this after reading the preview that stated this was the heaviest korn to date by one of the band members. This was the first time I can honestly say that I wasted money on music. I never thought it could be this terrible. The SYOTOS album took a bit of getting used to, but still it was tollerable once you listened to it a few times. On every song it seemed to start out dull and about mid song, just when I thought they were going to pick up, they just stayed the same. I have every Korn song out there, not just holding onto the past, this really sucked!"
1,Where's the Rock?,"Guitars please?? Bass please?? Drums please?? This is quadruple tracked vocals layered with HEAVY HEAVY SYNTH. This is Jonathin showing his 80's MTV influence with all the Synth and Duran Duran style bands he must have loved because I hear it in him.Where's the ""sick"" ""Non Human"" drumming from the great Terry Bozzio? My personal opinion is that he played a few things but probably wasn't impressed with these tracks and passed. This album is going to tank, i'll be surprised if they recover from this. One things clear to most Korn fans is Head was the true writer for the band that gave them their heavy sound while munky strummed on what he was told."
1,korn=10-10 this CD=1-5,"dont get me wrong, I love korn saw them at family falues twice in concert. there a great band, but honestly this CD has no korn flavor to it, twisted transistor was a great song in see you on the others side, but evolution doesn't compete I only heard two metal songs on here evolution and hold on. To many soft songs, hated this album.Korn better impress me, there droppin from 3rd favorite to 5thSTATIC_XGODSMACKwas KORNMETALLICASlipknotSlayerso on"
1,I wish I never bought the CD,I am a huge Korn fan ever since I heard Shoots and Ladders on the radio. I have loved every single song and CD they have ever released. I even bought anything they were a part of as producers or players. I wish to god I never bought this CD. I bought it but I don't even think it is worth stealing. I am so scared that Head and David were the real brains and creativity of this band and the the remaining 3 will just kill the image I have grown to know and love.
4,Untitled,"Initially, liked most of the songs. After listening for a few days, then began liking all of the songs. Obviously, I've got favorites: Evolution, Ever Be and Starting Over. Overall, a good effort by the remaining members of Korn. Keep up the good work!"
3,"Part Korn, Part NiN, Part Marilyn Manson","More often than not, when a long-running band comes out with a new album, I compare the new product with their latest ""Greatest Hits presented by Time Life Music"" compilation. In this case, their latest album fails pretty miserably against their ""Greatest Hits Part I""Bits of NiN and Marilyn Manson run rampant (not that that's all bad either) in an album that lacks the edge of many of their previous offerings. Of course we should have seen it coming ... we're now on ""the other side.""""Evolution"" will get tons of rock airplay. But that's a tell, isn't it?Buy it if you like Korn. Buy it if you like NiN. You won't be hugely disappointed but you won't pull this one out when someone asks you why you like Korn."
2,Here we go...,As any KoRn fan would know...flop. I find absolutely no need to find any reason to purchase this whole album. Losing Brian...they made due. But with David leaving too...it's no good. What next? James? Bass and vocals. I wonder what the live show would be like.
5,Awesome Album,I have been a Korn fan for 10 years and this alum doesn't let me down. I like it better than SYOTOS and Untouchables.
3,Disappointing,"UntitledHands down to these guys for still crankin' out records and goin' as hard as they are and that they tried something new but... I have been a diehard Korn fan for about 10 years now and have always loved them for their uniqueness. This album, to me, was way too commercial and it sounded more like it belongs in a sad circus or a dance club."
5,a momentous debut,"From the first few notes of ""Todo Termino"", the world had a new star in its musical firmament. At 21, the power and maturity of his voice is extraordinary, the only clue to his youth is the cute guy on the cover. These are all beautiful rancheras, and ""Cuando Yo Queria Ser Grande"" by Manuel Monterrosas, about a parent grown old, is one of the most touching songs I've ever heard...you'll weep salty tears as I did. The final track, ""Que Pregunta Muchacho"", is a duet with his father, the legendary Vicente. Though this is the only recording of his that doesn't contain lyrics in a booklet, his enunciation is so perfect you won't miss a word. This CD is also available as part of a terrific set, ""Mis Primeros Exitos"", which contains his first 3 CDs, individually wrapped, and in a nice box. I really recommend getting the set, you'll love them all !"
5,Love his music,Alejandro has such a range that it is hard not to listen to him be it Ranchero or Romances or Salsa kind music. I am not hispanic but I do appreciate good music when I hear one.
3,A typical Beanie Baby,Considering this was purchased to collect and not to be played with; it is a good product.
2,"I like the author, the edition I did not like.",I picked the wrong edition. Print was too small for me. I think I could have bought it at a garage sale for a much cheaper price. The trouble with some of Saylors books is that some of them could have taken place almost anywhere. I just like Rome. No question this was strictly for mass marketing.
4,A Great Book and a Thrilling Adventure,"I loved this book. It was exciting and intreging. I read it for a Latin class and it was so vivid and amazing. I'm not that big of a fan of murder mysteries, but I really enjoyed this book and the author's style. Who knows? This might just make me a murder mystery reader."
1,Too much history not enough mystery,"I have been reading the Sub Rosa series this summer. The first novel Roman Blood was a superior mystery.The author put the reader in Rome. The mystery was beautifully plotted; the characters came alive. I was happy. the other books were not as good, but I stayed with them. This one is the low point, so far. I had trouble sustaining interest in reading this. I finished finally to a no surprise ending. the mystery was especially transparent. I usually keep he mysteries that I red, but this one I threw away at the hotel. I hope these stories get better. If the next one is not better, I will skip reading any others."
2,Disappointing,"This could have been a blockbuster novel. The characters are far more lively than the cardboard cutouts found in most works. Yet something is missing. That something is plausibility. Problem is that the detective, Gordianus the Finder, is able to get folks to more than fully answer just about every question put to them. This is not realistic and so a most promising novel falls short of making the grade."
4,Twists in the mystery and the family,"I am a devoted reader of the Roman Sub Rosa series. Saylor has a formula going for these books which works very well. The reader gets an intriguing history lesson and a thrilling mystery at the same time. It's amazing how Mr. Saylor can flesh out these novels from actual events and extant speeches. Of course his fictitious private eye Gordianus enables him to do this. The reader experiences legendary people and events through the eyes of a ""regular"" Roman citizen and his family. And family is important. Saylor always seems to find a way to make the mystery have a twist as well as Gordianus' family story. Mysteries are revealed on more than one level, and that's an important mark of a great novel. I can't make myself give the book 5 stars because I reserve those for books that are life-changing. I didn't feel that way about Murder on the Appian Way, but I did highly enjoy it."
4,Thrilling,This book seems to keep you on the edge of your seat and you always want to find out what is going to happen next. I wish that I had read this book sooner than I did.
4,very exciting and educational,"Before reading Saylor I always wondered how Caesar et al. pulled it off and pulled down the Republic. Reading his exciting books, I am getting a feeling for the mess things were in 2,000 years ago! As soon as I read this one, I immediately bought all the other books in the series and they're all fascinating."
2,A plot in need of an editor,"While the book has good historical info, it is a rather droll read. Saylor drifts woodenly around historical events, more like driftwood caught in a whirlpool, than a Roman war trireme circling in for a kill.I really wanted to like this book, but it takes effort to finish it.If you want to read good Roman adventure, I suggest reading Julius Caesar's ""Conquest of Gaul""."
3,Disappointing,"I was a big fan of Steven Saylor's Roman mysteries, so I eagerly anticipated reading his latest installment, ""A Murder on the Appian Way."" Unfortunately, the book was excruciatingly dull and I kept waiting for the story to unfold. Saylor goes into great detail to explain Roman government, which may be interesting, but only if there is a plot in which to place it. Nothing at all happened in the first third of the book, and I realized I was forcing myself to keep reading. Then I put the book aside. I may try again later. But now I can only ask Steven Saylor: What happened"
3,Summary,"Ancient Rome is endlessly fascinating for me. Along with others of the author's, this book provides a look into the life of famous and ordinary people of that time."
3,A vivid image of Ancient Rome filled with suspense and myste,"This is the second Steven Saylor book I have read and I enjoyed it immensely. The book started out with immediate action that was rich in detail. The main characters were dynamic and intereseting. Saylors use of words creates imagry vividly present in every page. I could see every setting as if I were actually in the story. During the imprisonment, I felt that I couldn't stop reading until they had escaped. If you like Roman history or a riveting story, I suggest A Murder on the Appian Way. Every one of my fellow students agread with me in saying that this was the best school-read book ever."
3,"Blood, Deciet, and Conviction.","THIS BOOK FOR THE MOST PART WAS ENJOYABLE BUT A BIT CONFUSING. POLITICS, POLITICS, POLITICS. THAT WAS THE MAIN FOUCUS OF THIS BOOK. THE STORY OF THE BOOK IS OUTSTANDING BUT IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW AT TIMES. WITH SOME MANY CHARACTERS INTRODUCED AND FORGOT ABOUT AND THEN APPEARIN AGAIN, IT MAKES IT A CHALLENGE TO BE THOUROUGH WITH THE READING. THAT WAS JUST MY OPINION I KNOW MANY OTHERS FOUND IT TO BE EASY TO FOLLOW. I PERSONALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF FINDING THE TRUTH IN ALL THE CHAOS AND CONFUSION OF THE MURDER ON THE APPIAN WAY. I ENJOYED THE BOOK BUT I WOULD LIKE IT BETTER IF SOME OF THE POLITICAL IDEAS WERE LEFT OUT IT. I RECOMMEND IT FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE A HISTORICAL BOOK ANDS WHO LOVE A GOOD MYSTERY. IT DEALS WITH ROMAN CULTURE AND POLITICS."
1,Pathetic Piece of Junk,"I will never buy another Phillips product.To be fair, this thing was cheap, plays difficult disks well and has a decent picture.Nothing else about it was satisfactory, though. The remote never worked well and has failed completely after less than a year. The player boots up incredibly slowly and doesn't remember where you were. The menu system is poor at best and I have spent more time waiting on this thing than I have any other machine ever.I have never disliked a piece of electronics more than I've disliked this player."
2,so-so player,"So-so player. Upconverts signal but thats about it. Very few features and a remote with just a few buttons. It's very inexpensive and plays well but if you want more features you will have to pay more for a higher end player. You get what you pay for, if you're just looking for a player to upconvert this could be a good choice."
4,"some flaws, pretty good overall","The weak signal link between the remote and the unit can be annoying when you want or need to stop, pause, ff, or reverse a program quickly. Although there's no dedicated open/close button on the remote, the disc tray can be opened/closed with the remote if you press and hold the stop button for about 4 seconds). Also, the picture is excellent through the HDMI connection, and the unit is inexpensive. Finally, it does what I primarily bought it for - playing DivX dvd's. Update on 6/13: It doesn't appear to automatically set the aspect ratio (full screen or widescreen) to match that of the dvd - you must go into the menu and set it."
3,"Good, but odd","I got this to do upconversion on my 32in 720p lcd tv. It is AMAZING for widescreen movies upconverted over hdmi. It is not good for fullscreen. It stretches the picture over HDMI. The only solution to this is to use the component cables for fullscreen movies (tv on dvd). You loose upconvertion this way. It also took a good while to figure this out, thus the 3 star rating. I would recommend the player, but know this going in."
3,"Good picture quality and sound, crappy DVD drive.","The DVD player has good performace in terms of picture and sound quality using the HDMI and the price is good, BUT when I started using the DVD Drive I saw how the DVD Drive Door got jammed with my DVDs a couple of times. I was worry that the door would scratch the DVDs, so I returned it. A Couple other things that I didn't like is:-The Remote Control doesn't have eject-The system takes a lot of time to boot and shutdown"
5,Philips DVP3960 - Excellent HDMI upconverter,"Pros - excellent value for money, have had the unit 3 months now and use it with my 1080i HDTV plasma. Absolutely no problems and I love the region free functionality together with auto screen sizing. Picture quality is excellent and my advice is to hold off on full uprading to a BluRay or HDDVD until the war of the HD formats is over.Cons - CD tray is a little flimsy so be gentle with it - you'll need to be patient too as it takes about 3 - 5 seconds to open upon startup. The onscreen menu is also a little cumbersome, but once you've set it up you won't have to again under normal circumstances.Overall - Excllent value for money with a good upconverted 1080i picture, nice feature to have region free functionality with reliability to go along with it all."
1,Piece of crap,"Sluggish and temperamental from day one -- but, we figured it was so cheap, we could live with it. Then it died at 13 months.Also interesting to read the review from another reader about scratches. We are very careful with our DVD's. Prior to buying this POC, played them on our computer for three years and never had any scratches. Now they are all scratched to hell.I won't buy Phillips again."
1,Can't wait to return it,"The picture quality is horrible. The picture came across fuzzy and the colors were obnoxiously bright. I adjusted the colors on the TV, but I was still not happy with the quality of the picture. I did try several different DVDs and better cables, but they did not make a difference."
4,Philips DVP3960 Multiformat Provides Value,This product is a very compact and reliable system with the ability to play a wide range of CDs. The set up instructions are provided in enough detail to set up the system but the user needs to have some experience with CD players in order to make the sytem work properly. The DVD player will not play CDs coded for other regions but will play CDs from other countries that are labeled all reagions or that are not coded.
2,Not Happy,"It looks as cheap as it is, doesn't play all DVD's and the remote NEVER worked. we called the 800# provided by Amazon and were told the warranty doesn't cover the remote, so we had to purchase a new one for $20.04 which was not in stock and we were told it will take 3 to 4 weeks for delivery.Not happy!"
2,not what you think,I just got this and it's going back.Miss leading on what it playsI got it for Reg 2 BUT it will only play Reg 1 or a DVD that has Reg ALL (just got off the phone with their support people as it played 2 DVD out of 12 that I tried that were Reg 2.If all you want it for is to play Reg 1 then it's a great buy with a good picture.Not Happy
2,shoulda spent more,"I'm sure the specs are all wonderful on this unit, at least they looked that way when I researched buying it. I have nothing to A/B it with here, but it looks fine.my only point is that it really is a cheapo looking and feeling unit, I wish I would have spent more. The door takes forever to open, looks like it's made of the thinnest plastic possible. Confusing readouts like ""ROOT"" and a teeny little play remote...look, if you're really cheap or can't afford anything else, this will work and probably look great. But I wish I would have spent more and gotten a nicer unit."
5,The BEST travel guide!,"I highly recommend this book to anyone traveling to Germany. Even though my mother is a native German and I spent a large part of my childhood in Germany, this book is invaluable to me! It is packed with a wealth of information. Not only are the itineries well planned, the maps easy to follow and the ""day trips"" really easy to do in a day, but the restaurant choices are also terrific... Every restaurant that we ate at was in this guide and every one was fabulous. Hurray for Mr. Steinbicker! Please keep them coming!!!!"
5,Great!,"We used Frankfurt as a ""base"" on a recent family vacation and this book was perfect for helping us explore the surrounding area. We rented a car for two of the days and did train trips for two other days. In both cases, the itinerary suggested in this book was ideal. What a perfect way to see the best a region has to offer. We're already reading the day trips around Munich for our next trip back to Germany."
4,well...,"A friend actually let me borrow the same book, but 5th edition and we just had to have one for ourselves. It tells you all the places you can visit, has maps, and even suggestions for resturants and costs.Great buy!"
3,Great Info would prefer more pictures,"This has great trip info and area info but I am a visual person and wish there were more pictures and color at that. All in all great book, will be putting it to the test this summer!!"
4,Travel Planning,Excellent guide. I can hardly wait to get off the plane and discover some of the cities listed in here. The directions and city maps will make it so much easier to get around and navigate. I'll know right where to go and not just wander around aimlessly. The only thing I wish is that this was a newer edition...I didn't notice it was written in 2002.
3,traveling in germang,"This book has a lot of good information, but not illustrated in such a way a travel book should be - not colorful at all."
2,Daytrips Germany,"Useful but boring, the same format over and over. The 2002 edition I just received is really out of date. Maps are less useful since part of the print becomes part of the binding. Rick Steve's book, Germany and Austria 2007, is so much more enjoyable to read."
5,This is a good one!,"I really liked this book; it talks about things (serivces) ,show you how to do them,critisize, praize , give a real life examples ,and more than this it gives a startup on some script for each service you wanna setup. I would love to get from the same author(s) another edition with different authetication mechanisme other than NIS (it's getting old) like ldap or kerberos....ok that's all!"
3,"Lacks detail, poor fit and finish","These models will require more work than the Enterprise B,C, and E do to make them look nice. The details on the Enterprise and Enterprise A are fine considering their small size, but the details on the D are just plain boring. You will have to paint each window and escape hatch by hand (without any guide except a picture) or else buy a decal set made for this scale of ship. Furthermore, these require more shaving and sanding of plastic to make the pieces fit together well. That said, I love having all six ships in the same scale and in a size that I can easily store."
2,"Would work, except not exactly for whats stated","The purchase was intended to turn a Chevy 3800 series II engine which is a 90^ V6 for those unaware, which turns out that the crank shaft snout is a few tenths of an inch too wide. Other than that the socket looks like it would work for older models or smaller crank shaft snouts, this would have been well worth the purchase had the Item actually worked."
1,Save Your Money,"This is NOT the Paradise Lost that has been recording the last few years, but a video from 1989 when the band sounded like Cannibal Corpse. Pitiful. Waste of my hard-earned money. Amazon should warn customers that this ""new"" DVD is old material."
4,alot of storage in a small piece,Many many flashlights and batteries are kept in this piece. I have it with inexpensive jade inlay flowers purchased from a store going out of business.
2,NOT Crisp and Clear!,"Extremely disappointed with this product. I don't hear anything BUT static, and when the volume is turned up the static is even more annoying. The static is uncomfortably annoying even from the adjoining room! I would advise looking carefully at other customers' reviews before making this purchase."
1,too much static!,"I registered for this because it got good reviews but now that I am using this I find the truth is it is WAY to static prone! It gets set off to full blaring static for no reason, in the middle of the night it goes static for minutes at a time at full volume. The only thing to stop it is to turn it off completely! Not really an option when listening for your baby, which is why you have it in the first place! I do like that it has a regargable battery but it is not worth buying for that alone! I am buying a new one because it is bad enough getting no sleep from having a baby but to loose any more because your monitor is screeching in the middle of night is another thing all together!"
2,you hear too much!!!!,"Yes, you hear too much!!! the first time I used it I got a phone call and I was able to hear the other person's voice and my own thru the monitor!!!!The static is always being there, is better to turn it off so you don't go crazy. Also one day it sounded like something was flying near it, you know the wings touching the monitor...it was awfull.Now that we are in an apartment is great becuase I can hear the people next door talking in the phone...thru the monitor, so at least we get a show.And yes, you can hear the baby breathing...this is when you actually decide to leave it on."
1,Will the real distance please stand up?,I am comfused. In your comparison study it says that this monitor has a range of 200 feet. The clip right below it says 400 feet. Which is it? I have a large house (5000 sq ft) and I need a monitor whose signal will reach from the first floor to the second. Is there a monitor out there that would be best for me? I also would like to have a double monitor so I could have one at each end of the house.
1,Constant interference,"Unfortunately, I tested this product successfully at home and threw away the packaging. Then my phone rang - constant static when using the cordless phone. And, as others reported, there are occasional blips of static - very, very, very annoying. I am now out the cash and still have to buy another monitor.If you try it - make sure to save the packaging for a while until it is tested under ALL conditions!"
2,May keep you awake!,"While this does what a monitor is basically supposed to do, I would frequently be startled awake by ""cracking"" and ""popping"" noises throughout the night. Changing the monitor's position was not always helpful. Sometimes the noise could be cleared up by unplugging and using the battery option, however that just wastes batteries and becomes expensive."
4,Crisp & Clear Picks Up Minute Sounds,"I registered for this monitor because of a positive report written up in a baby products' book. The first few nights I used it, I nearly jumped out of my skin when my child cried, because it picked up his sounds and movement so well just on the 4 (out of 10) setting. Since then, I keep it on setting one and can hear wonderfully. It's great to be able to hear him breathing.The only problem I've run into is when I have my cordless phone in use next to the carrier unit. It causes static to come from the unit.All in all, it's a wonderful monitor."
2,"Short range, poor sound, diminishing quality during night","We tried this monitor because it was ranked highest by the Baby Bargains people and we had otherise agreed with them on many items. But this one was terrible. Our house is compact, but even in the next room (10-15 feet), it would go out of range and get such severe static that the baby was inaudible. Then it developed this bizarre habit of period static that got longer and more frequent as time went on, until it was nearly driving us mad. We thought it was just our house or was because we have cordless phones and live close to our neighbors. But then we tried the Fisher Price Sound N Lights monitor and our problems were 100% solved - plus, it's cheaper. I would not recommend this First Years monitor - or their other electronic products - to other parents (we also have their crib white noise machine and it gobbles batteries like no tomorrow)."
3,Helpful Yet Disappointing,"This is the first baby monitor I have owned, so I have no other monitor with which to compare. It picks up nursery sounds well--with the volume turned up I can hear our baby breathing (something that is personally comforting to me). It does miss some sounds here and there. My main problem, however, is the booming bursts of static. If I keep the receiving unit stationary (i.e. on bedside table) the static is minimal. But just move it one inch in any direction and the bursts of static are unreal. If I travel from one room to the next, I have to turn it off until I am stationary again. Now, it is picking up a very loud buzzing/bell-like sound at night occuring at regular intervals that makes it impossible to leave the unit on. We haven't been able to determine the origin of the sound. After having to spend the night on the nursery floor because the interfering noise was impossible to sleep through or even hear the baby over, I'm shopping for a new one today!"
3,Not so crisp and clear,"After one week of using this monitor my husband finally got fed up and insisted we go back to using our Fisher Price Sounds and Lights monitor. The first 2 nights we used this it sounded great. We didn't even hear the ever so slight humming sound we heard with our other monitor. Starting with night three, the monitor started to act up. If you walked by it, it would start to blast static. In the middle of the night for no reason it would let out a high pitched sound and emit a great deal of static. As new parents, sleep is a precious commodity and we don't want to be disturbed unless our daughter needs us, not because the monitor wants attention. By the 7th night, the monitor let out nothing but static. I'm not sure why but this monitor is only worthless at night (when we would rely on it the most). I have been using the parent unit downstairs for about 2 months now, and I have yet to have a problem with it during the day. I just wish it performed as well at night."
2,Very poor range,I bought this monitor because of the good review that it got in the Baby Bargains book but am now in the market for a new monitor. Some nice features of this monitor are the rechargable batteries and compact size but it has a very short range. In the house at night it works great but as soon as I step outside the house all I get is loud static. Even on my deck with the doors open I can't get any reception with this monitor. If you want to be able to go outside at all this is not the monitor for you.
1,What a lemon!,"I registered for and received this monitor. My baby was born the end of June, I have used this monitor a handful of times and the batteries are always going dead or I am out of range at a short distance. I have tried replacing the rechargable batteries and the monitor still does not work, it's a lemon. I am very disappointed with this product and would not put my trust in it so far as to get another one. In fact I am going to purchase a Fisher Price, my best friend has had the same baby monitor for 6 years now and 4 children later, she has convinced me to go with Fisher Price for quality and more important reliability."
1,A real frustration,"I can't move 5 feet from the baby unit without the parent unit bursting out static because, as the light on the parent unit tells me, I'm ""out of range."" This product is really useless."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I guess it depends where you live...but we get a lot of static with this monitor. We can only use it late at night or else there is too much interference. Yes, it does pick up even the slightest noises and you can hear your baby but the static too much. We are on the market for a new monitor and our baby is only 9 weeks old."
1,Too much static,I have never been able to use this monitor because there is so much static that is makes getting some sleep impossible. My daughter's room is only 40 feet away so there should be no reason for all the noise. I have finally become so frustrated that I am returning mine and ordering a new one.
1,Terrible monitor,This is the worst monitor i have ever used and i've tried a few different ones. I am returning it because of the static. You don't need to get static - do not buy this monitor!
2,Too much static!,This monitor came highly recommnded in one of those books that reviews/recommends products for expectant parents so I thought it was a good buy but boy has it failed. We have been very disappointed! The static is horrible and leaves you fumbling to position it to find the least static possible. The range is short as well -for some reason I can go in the back yard and have some static reception but the front yard gets no reception at all (they are equidistant from the nursery). We have had it for a year and now it is static all of the time so I am ditching this waste of money and getting a different brand! Save your money!
2,"At 1 year, I'm buying a new monitor","There have been times that the static on this monitor was SO bad, I've almost thrown it out the window. (ok, hormones during the 1st three months could have been high) But seriously, we used our inlaws older model FP and it's much, much clearer. We'll be buying that now."
1,Would not recommend,"We just had our second child and got this monitor with our first who is 21 months. We had some problems using it the first time -either a lot of static or annoying interference but didn't have to use it much since the baby was in the next room - but with our second child, it has been completely unreliable. I can't even use it and have had to sleep on the couch for the first 3 weeks so that I can hear the baby crying. We either get loud noises every 5-10 seconds (even when moving it to several different places in the room) or get interference from cell/cordless phones. I am extremely disappointed in the product and would not recommend it to anyone. I bought it after my sister did (she had her first 3 months before mine and has had many of the same problems)."
4,"Near Perfect Indoors, Not Bad Outside","I like this monitor. I have used others and they don't even compare. The battery allows for very long lasting cordless use. It works great with or without the cord throughout my house (1800 sqft plus 1000 sqft basement). The few times I have heard static, it has been easily remedied by changing the monitor channel. My childs room is on the other end of the house and he sounds like he's right beside me...the sound is quite crisp and clear even on a low volume. But, when I take the monitor outside cordless, the reliablity is only marginal. I end up having to put up with fuzzy sounds until I find the right spot to place it. Even so, I would still recommend this monitor as being one of the best ones out there! Indoors its near perfect, outdoors it does the job with a little patience."
4,"Clear, very helpful monitor","We have owned this monitor for a year, since the birth of our son. It is impossible to think of not owning a monitor, let alone one that does not offer clear sound. We have the monitor placed in the nursery on a wall opposite the crib, and can still hear him breathing. In fact, the monitor is so clear, I haven't been able to use it next to my bed because I hear every move he makes. The only thing negative about this monitor is that it will pick up neighbor feedback. In addition, the batteries seem to go quickly on the parent monitor- we usually end up plugging it in most of the time. Overall, we have enjoyed this monitor a great deal and bring it with us everywhere we go."
2,I agree!,"I also had static problems. I'm wondering if it is due to the fact that this monitor has just two channels. Is this standard for others? It's my first monitor, and we selected it because it seemed simple and uncomplicated. We have heard neighbors phone calls plain as could be! We had to lay it on it's side because the ceiling fan makes it sound as if a helicopter were taking off. I would like to buy another monitor if my husband will break down!"
1,Terrible Monitor,"We got this monitor as a gift. Since day one, it has been static, stactic, static. We cannot get this monitor to give us one good reception. I have called the compnay several times to replace this, and still nothing. I would not recommend this product to anyone who has any sanity."
