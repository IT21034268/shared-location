5,Texas Rockabilly at it's best...,"This album, Rev's first full-length studio effort, is superb rockabilly. Known for his flamboyant style and fast guitar, the Rev took over ten years of road experience and laid down the tracks for this album. It is sensational. He combines rock and roll, country, and swing to deliver a prime example of what rockabilly should aspire to be."
4,Love Klimt and Austria,Have already seen many of these works in Vienna and elsewhere. xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xx x
3,"Estoy de acuerdo, no es el mejor","Bueno, no es el mejor, xo tampoco fue su despedida. Ahora sale otro (Yo, minoría absoluta), y también ha salido su colaboración con Platero y Tú y Chinato (Extrechinato y tú). Yo recomendaría el Deltoya y el Rock Transgresivo, aunque como recopilación de todos, el Iros a Tomar Por Culo está muy bien. Este disco no es el mejor. Diría incluso q es el peor, pero aún así tiene buenas canciones, como Golfa. Por cierto, si les gusta este grupo, les recomendaría buscar algo de Marea. Son un grupo genial con muy buenas canciones. Los discos se llaman La Patera y Revolcón."
2,Extremoduro (el ultimo),"Reconocido como el final de su carrera, Canciones Prohibidas, finaliza una larga saga de discos de este grupo español. Agila, Iros todos a tomar pol culo, Rock Transgresivo, ... componen, entre otros, la larga discografía de Robe y sus secuazes. De sus ya archiconocidas canciones como ""Jesucristo García"", ""La carrera"", y colaboraciones con diferentes bandas sonoras como las de ""Barrio"" o ""El dia de la bestia"" (junto al cantaautor catalán Albert Pla) termina ya un largo trabajo empezado a mediados de los 80 con una historia cargada de polémicas por el abuso de las drogas. Aunque todo hay que reconocerlo, y Canciones Prohibidas no es ni mucho menos una obra de arte para sus seguidores, sino todo lo contrario. Parece un disco hecho para contentar al público de su largo letargo de inactividad. Un disco que dio poco de hablar y que, además, poco se habla ya."
2,Disappointing Plot,"This was my first Spencer experience and I am amazed she is a best-selling author. I was disappointed with the lack of plot... the entire story revolved around a young woman's struggle with self-image. The hero, Brian, was depicted as a wonderful, warm, caring man looking for love and not thrills. So the message that ran through this book -- a man who looked beyond skin deep to see the ""real"" person inside had potential. However, the development of their relationship was focused on sexual encounter rather than furthering the discovery of their personalities. Brian's charm begins to crack towards the end... A man who truly loves his girl won't push her into sex (as Brian was doing) when she has made it clear how important commitment (marriage) is to her. After being together for only 15 days, Brian angrily demands unconditional trust from Theresa and cannot understand why she is hesitant to give it???"
1,not a spencer book a real let down,Mrs Spencer is my favorite author. I'm very sad she will not be writing any more books I just found the story of breast reduction a little far fetched and I'm a R.N. My favorite Spencer book is Morning Glory. I have searched for other Spencer type authors but none compare!!
3,intriguing,"I have read most of Ms. Spencers booka, while ""Separate Beds"" is my favorite, i think that ""Sweet Memories"" is extremely touching and moving. This book is an excellent read, although I was unable to relate to the protagonist. I read this book a while ago and am currently looking for it, to purchase. READ IT, it is an experience!"
1,so borrrrrrring,"I have read everyone of her books, some numerous times - Bittersweet is my all time favorite - and this one was in one word AWFUL. Very slow, uninteresting characters, I didn't care about any of them. Very drab book. I wasted $11.75. I tried to sell it at garage sale and it didn't budge for 5 cents. That just about says it. I wonder what ever happened to Maggie and Eric and Nancy from Bittersweet - that would be a great follow up."
2,Not my favorite,I found this book to be a little much. I sympathised with thearesa but couldn't connect with her or the story line. I had a hard time believing Brian. I did enjoy how she wrote out their letters. I did sympathise with the long distance of their relationship having been in one myself. It was well written but hard to get into.
2,Boring,I read it but did not particularly like it. It seemed to go on and on. I did love THE ENDEARMENT so I will try again.
3,I'm So Dissapointed!,"I loved this book. I've read every one of LaVerle Spencer's books, and sometimes more than once. I was upset when she retired and left us without her books to look forward to. I really thought when I saw this one advertised as coming out in hardback in Jan. 03, that she had come out of retirement and written for us once again. I have my local library looking for this NEW book, and I've called countless friends about it. Now, I realize I've read it!! Please tell Ms. Spencer, enough is enough. Please write again."
4,A good story....,"Far and away my favorite Spencer book is ""Family Blessings""; however, I enjoyed this book. I think the book should be entitled ""Sweet Mammaries."" Ha ha! I think Ms. Spencer handled the subject in a sensitive manner while wrapping a nice story around it. I, too, would enjoy a sequel."
3,Just Okay,"Although this is not one of her best stories, One cannot help but understand Theresa's personal and painful plight in becoming a woman. The insecurity about her body (having large breasts) translates well with any girl to whom Nature has not been kind, no matter the short coming. Genetic imperfections can be exceptionally difficult to live with, let alone changing them. Brian's strength of character was heartwarming and refreshing. LaVyrle Spencer has the wonderful gift of being able to communicate this delicate subject with kindness and compassion."
4,"If you've been there, you'll understand","I just finished this book, and to anyone who has been through what Thresa has you will understand completly. Lavyrle Spencer really can relate to the trials and tribulations of getting ""more than your fair share"" from Nature. This is a wonderful book"
3,Left me a Little Flat (pun),"I have every book Ms Spencer has written and loved most of them. This one left me flat, excuse the pun.The characters were believble, but a whole book dedicated to big boobs? Heavens!I'll say one thing though, if anyone could pull this book off, Ms Spencer could do it. She really made us understand the problems and feelings of one so endowed. It was just such an unusual topic for a book."
2,Boring Memories would be more Accurate,"This book was not the usual Spencer book. It had no compelling storyline and the love story was very boring. It starts with a big breasted lady named Theresa meeting her brother's handsome friend Brian. While there are some cute 80's references in their that you don't get out of too many sappy books, it was hard to stay awake long enough to remember the story. She goes through a breast reduction surgery and he gets peeved. The book blurb says he gets totally upset about it and the book only showed him mildly upset. There's never in any part of the book any ""real"" emotions from eithier of the main characters. The only ""real"" person in the story is the mother. And she's portrayed as the ""bad"" guy because she is so bossy and runs the family."
4,"A quick, pleasant read...","""Sweet Memories""...I cant say that this was my favorite book of Spencers, but it was still a good book. Theresa and Brian were so good together. Brian ...ooooh, Brian...I could just imagine him all lean hipped in his faded Levis with his blazing green eyes....~sigh~...Yes, he was a major draw for me in this book. I am usually more drawn to Spencers heroines. While I did enjoy Theresa, sometimes she was just too childish for my taste. I did feel for her though and I was so happy when she began to heal and allow herself to open to Brians love. My main problem with this book would have to be the overly syrupy sweetness of the writing that at times made me cringe. I have read a lot of Spencers work and I most definitely prefer her historicals, but even with its flaws, ""Sweet Memories"" was still a worthwhile read."
5,I loved it!,"This book is one of the best written romance novels I've ever read. An unusual premise. I had a friend with similar issues (overly-large breasts), so I sympathized with what the heroine was going through. Great story and sexual tension between the hero and heroine. Loved it."
5,Great compilation of Mozart's later symphonies...,"...and few do it better than Sir Neville Marriner. Still, go look for the complete symphonies (ASIN B0000501PD), which is all of his symphonies (some 52 or so including those that are unnumbered). This set can be found much cheaper used...I picked it up for 48 bucks on this site. It has the exact same performances of symphonies 21-41 that are here, plus another 30 or so symphonies and it's 40 bucks cheaper than this set. Look for it, and go get it. I was very impressed with the entire set, Marriner is about as steady as they come for Mozart, with the possible exception of Karl Bohm.Two other sets to consider that cover much of the same ground, and are probably a bit better:Mozart: Symphonies 21-41; Krips/ConcertgebouwMozart: Symphonies 28-41; Davis/Staatskapelle Dresden"
5,Mozart's Peak,"Although quite an investment, anything so encompassing of Mozart's grandeur is money well-spent. The later symphonies were when he truly perfected the art--I do like 18 & 19 however. Haffner and Linz (35 & 36) are mastered by Mariner, Brendel, and their Academy."
3,safety first,"When Marriner first put the orchestra of St. Martin in the Fields on the map, the recordings were a breath of fresh air, offering exciting renditions of old bromides, giving the listener a chance to approach the experience of the audience that heard the first performances of these compositions. Most of that is gone with these recordings of the Mozart symphonies. The hallmark of the performances is prudence and compromise. Something calculated to draw in the maximum number of buyers; in other words, an economic decision, rather than an artistic one. One could do much worse, but, also, one could do much better. A fresh approach to this music is coming out with performances by the Danish Radio Sinfonietta under the direction of Adam Fischer, based on the Urtext of the New Mozart Edition, Baerenreiter Verlag, Kassel. I have Vol 6, and it will knock your socks off."
5,"Clean, Witty Humor","It is often very difficult to find humor which is not topically modern or uncreatively vulgar. This gem is unquestionably neither. While somewhat dry at times, Bob Newhart clearly has a wit which shows forth magnificently in this routine which is over 40 years old. It does not seem dated at all and gives me laughs every time that I listen to it. If you are looking for comedy which is truly creative and well-presented, this is a great buy!"
4,Funny little book,"This book is a fun read for classic Dr. Who fans. It makes light hearted fun of the show and the charecters. It is a very small paperback, written like a dictionary, with each item listed in alphabetical order followed by a description or comment on the subject. A good laugh, not meant as serious."
2,well-deserved obscurity,"I've wanted to like this, but I just can't. Stale lyrics and weak melodies, an overwrought male voice with an unpleasant Dexy's Midnight Runners' style yelp at times, and the whole thing steeped in enough pretension to embarrass even a Lawrence Durrell reader. No wonder the French worship this band. The snooty liner notes, in which a band member blames the lack of commercial success on loyalty to its ""art"" would have kept me from buying this if I'd been able to read them first..."
2,Mediocre collection by a mediocre band,"The Go-Between are a really overrated band. Their songs are often just dull soundscapes with weak melodies and whiny singing. They never had commercial success because they sat between the chairs of underground rock and guitar pop. Some songs are well done, especially the intros, but they cut no ice and don't manage to hold the listener's interest till the end. I wouldn't buy this disappointing CD again. If you really want to hear a great collection of '80s guitar pop songs, check out ""Louder than bombs"" by The Smiths, ""Absolute classic masterpieces"" by Felt, ""1984-89"" by Lloyd Cole, and ""Chaps"" by The Monochrome Set."
2,Cheap 'n Cheerful,"The frames fit well but the lenses do not appear to fit the frames properly, you can see gaps around the lenses in places and the lenses just pop out when you are trying to clean them."
4,Good value,"I have not had a chance to use the unit yet, but it arrived quickly and in good condition. I have a barn to paint, so it will get the ""acid"" test soon."
1,rip off,"reconditioned allright, it's really bad when you spend money and when you assume it would work you put your expensive paint in it and guess what!! let's rent a paint sprayer. no further comment"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This product was refurbished well, but it did not even partly live up to what it should do. This would have been a very unpleasant experience had I not been able to send it back to amazon. The amazon store is great, but this product is not."
2,Wagner airless,"I'm not sure how this product works with paint. We tried it with sealer for indoorr concrete (first water based and then oil) floors and the voluminous liquid vapor in the air just wasn't worth it. We had more sealer on the walls, windows and our clothing than the floor."
2,Do not waste your money.,Do not waste your money or more importantly your time with this item. I bought one and had a nightmare with it. It lost suction after just a few seconds. It's a major pain to clean up after a job. Bottom line - IT DOES NOT WORK!
4,Good sprayer - a pain to clean,Overall a good unit but a thorough cleaning is essential for continued proper operation. I would strongly suggest that you use this for only large jobs as a proper cleaning takes a good 25-40 minutes. We used it for painting cement block which was a great time saver.Not sure if I'd buy again - as it is a pain to clean...Good price though.
4,So far so good,"The equipment looks like new. I had been using this for about a month to paint everything I can and the sprayer give a incredible finish. When I read the manual, it seems to me that the cleaning process will be real complex, but actually is very very easy."
3,A pain in the you no what to clean,THE PAINT CREW SPRAYED REALLY WELL BUT ITS NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING. THE NEW PAINT CREW PLUS IS THE WAY TO GO IF YOU WANT TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR A NEW SPRAYER. THE PAINT CREW PLUS ADDRESES ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THE PAINT CREW HAS BEEN HAVING. IF YOU WANT TO SAVE SOME MONEY BUY THE RECONDITIONED MODLE OF THE PAINT CREW BUT I WOULD NOT RECOMEND BUYING IT NEW.
2,Won't last,"After only four times using this sprayer the gun is shot (leaks). Wagner says it's ""worn."" Hard believe. It's a pain to clean and clogs to often. Don't recomend it."
5,wagner paint crew,"worked great. i was a little worried about it being reconditioned,but it worked and looked like a new machine for half the cost."
3,Works hard for a while.,"I purchased this paint sprayer to paint my fence and later my garage. It initially worked well on the fence, then stopped working midway though. It started working again mysteriously so I thought nothing of it. Six months later I used it paint the sealing of my garage with no problems. However, the third time I went to use it, the machine died as I was applying a clear coat to my garage floor. I got my money's worth, but next time I need a sprayer, I will spend a little more and go to COSTCO."
1,zero star design,"If zero stars would be an option to express the appreciation for a product, this spray painter would be a prime candidate. What a deficient design. Unit plugs up about every time you use it. After the 3rd time the intake valve seized. It is a major effort to clean out the unit when these things go wrong, and after you had a successful paint session. Stay away from it.Wagner Power Products 515000 3/8 HP 2,750 PSI Paint Crew Paint Sprayer"
4,Very good sprayer; tedious cleanup,"Highly recommended sprayer. The sprayer, once you get it going, is very good at distributing paint evenly and quickly. The organization of the Owner's Manual, however, is another matter. The Owner's Manual is hard to follow. The cleanup procedure, as described in the manual, is tedious but necessary if you want the sprayer to work next time you need it. Make sure you follow all the cleanup steps including the oil in the Inlet/Outlet Valves. After a couple of iterations you get the hang of the process and everything goes much more smoothly. A rewrite of the manual would make this an excellent product."
4,Does what it made to do.,"In short, it does what its bought to do, and it does it well. I bought the reconditioned cause I'm a cheapo, but it arrived in terrific condition. And I'm glad I saved myself the extra $99. There are only 2 little problems. 1. You do have to reprime the machine every so often, (usually when paint gets low, but it only takes about a minute or less). and 2. Cleaning it is very important. It isn't hard to clean, its just tedious work. But I am very glad I purchased it and do recommend this to anyone looking to save time and get a professional result."
5,Painting has never been easier,"I have never used a paint sprayer before, but I was able to get it done with the easy to understand instructions. The performance of this sprayer is awsome. Clean up was also simple. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to tackle large amounts of painting."
1,Waste of money and time,I purchased after having bad luck with both the Ryobi and Wagner hand held sprayer. This was a waste as well. It uses a lot of paint or stain. The hose connections leak despite using tools to tighen. It sprays evenly for a bit then throws a blob of paint. I wasted a lot of paint and ruined a few projects.
1,a dont buy,"junk. will last maybe 30 minutes. wagner customer service is the worst. right up there with directv. got shocked, and ripped off on this one."
2,Used. Very Used.,"Got mine today, and guess I drew the short straw. Mine has paint flecks all over the main housing. The gun itself is all chipped up, looks like it was dropped several dozen times. On the plus side, looks like they put a new tip and hose in the box, but everything else looks very used - like it has been used to paint a hundred houses.I am thinking I'll return it. Hopefully that is not an issue. I really want to finish painting my garage though, so not sure. I also see a new Paint Crew Jr. for 20 bucks more, and I am kicking myself for not ordering that instead."
4,Gian Time Saver,"This has been a giant time saver. I used to paint my stockade fence by hand, around my property. It was hundreds of feet of 6 foot fence. I have used this sprayer the last two times and I save about 3 1/2 man days worth of time, each time I do it. Everything was decent as far as setup, painting and overall performance was very good. Cleanup was not that bad but took a bit longer than I was hoping. Cleanup is key with paint sprayers."
4,good product,"Worked very well, but I advise purchasers to read the instructions and find other helpful hints from various web sites concerning painting with a paint sprayer. It does take some time to clean up but not much more time than I spend cleaning paint brushes. Good product for the money."
2,"Worked well, died quickly","Purchased the refurbished Wagner Paint Crew sprayer from Amazon 8 months ago and just got a task to use it on. Sprayer worked well and did a great job at increasing the speed and quality of my home-improvement painting. Unfortunately I had 2 problems with the sprayer: 1) During the first cleaning I discovered that during refurbishing they did not replace the gun filter and it was completely clogged from the previous owner, 2) The unit died after the 3rd use. The pressure activated microswitch burned out. Cannot comment on performance of new units but based on my experience I would not recommend getting a refurbished one."
4,"Good product, takes a little practice",I used this to paint a 2 story house and found it really saves time. It takes a little practice to get the hang of it and apply an even coat. Usually it's best to keep a brush with you to take care of any drips or get into tight spots. It does take a while to clean but if you clean it well it will work sight the next time. Overall it's a good product for a homeowner I'd recomend it.
4,Wagner powermate paint sprayer,"Worked as advertised, would highly recommend purchasing this item. Spent a Sat/Sun and sprayed 5 /five gallon buckets of Behr undercoating to new drywall, yes 25 gals. and it worked great. The following weekend attempted to use and couldn't get it to spray!I did not ""lube"" the valve as stated in manual (must have missed that part)but did clean it very well after reading reviews prior to purchasing. Paint had dryed on the ""O"" rings and couldn't get any suction. Took apart and cleaned very carefully, and sprayed a little WD 40 and away I went. Bought reconditioned model and it worked just fine!"
1,Need a reason to make your life miserable?,"If your life is humming along and you are pretty happy but feel you have no right to be, then buy this paint sprayer. Believe me that happiness will go right out the window every time you try to use it. It had more clogs than the 100 year old drains in my house. The sprayer clogs, the primer clogs and the hose is too stiff. It takes as long to clean the thing as it does to do the painting. So be prepared to stop your painting and start cleaning 2 hours before you get tired. I returned mine to Amazon-they are great about taking things back that don't work. Save yourself the trouble and don't buy it in the first place."
1,Disaster waiting to happen,"Purchase this item and followed instructions to a ""T"" and made sure everything was tight and secure. I filled the hopper and as soon as I turned it on it blew out the connections like a bomb and cause $400 worth of damage!"
1,Should have listened to the reviews,"I should have listened to the other reviews of this product. Item worked okay when I recieved it. Other than having no control over the flow of paint and constant problems with priming the pump, it worked fine. I purchased this sprayer so I could paint my kitchen cabinets and get a factory smooth finish. Well since you can't adjust the flow what I got was runs and I used 3 gallons of paint to paint about 25ln/ft of cabinets. I purchased and used the cleaner and followed the manufacture's storage directions, and the next time I used the painter the pump would not prime. Luckily I bought the warranty and they were able to refund my purchase amount (minus $20 of shipping).Heed the warnings of the masses, and avoid this sprayer."
1,wagner sprayer,"This is the second one I have tried. Trust me when I say they are JUNK !! To make matters even worse, Amazon only offers a 30 day return for the piece of crap. I have had it 5 months and used it 2 times. I have sprayer less than 20 gallons of paint. It still looks new, and the pump is bad."
4,Great value,"Aside from a tiny spot of dried paint here and there in the crevices of the paint tray, you'd never know this product was not new. Works perfectly and at half the price of a new unit, it's hard to beat."
4,"Decent Sprayer, but drips","At first the sprayer didn't spray, but after cleaning the filter, it worked great. The only problem is I haven't figured out how to keep the paint from dripping. I laid kitchen cabinets on the ground to spray, and every once in a while a drop of paint fell.The cleaning is relatively simple."
4,It could use a more flexible hose,"It has been working great for the last 4 months. I have painted my entire inside-out of my newly remodeled home, and I'm starting to paint the outside of my sister's house. It is well build. The only thing that bothers me is that the hose is perhaps too rigid and it gets to my nerves that it is hard to handle. Other than that, highly recommended!One more note, when you let it sit for long, the diaphragm that is right underneath the plastic sieve may get ""stuck"". Only reach in with your finger (with the thing turned off), and push gently down so that the diaphragm or valve or however you want to call it gets released. If you do not do this, it may eventually go down with the weight of the liquid (paint), however if you are using small amounts of paint, you may still need to use your finger.Oh and yes, the sprayer gets cleaned thoroughly each time and all water residue cleared to avoid this, still, it may still happen every once in a while."
4,great fot the price,We bought the sprayer for a paint job and it was really worth the money and it made the job much easier so I would recommend this to others..the clean up is a little messy but worth it.
5,If only I could figure out how to clean it,"I purchased the recon wagner paintcrew paint sprayer from Amazon. It arrived and looked in excellent condition out of the box. It has the hose, spray gun and hopper. I used two adjustable wrenches to secure the hose to the hopper and the spray gun to the hose.It took me about one hour to paint my kitchen and hall way. It really did an awesome job spraying the latex paint. I can't believe how it takes all the hard work out of painting when using a brush or roller.I tried following the cleaning instructions, but I'm worried that I didn't do a very good job. I took the spray gun apart and tried cleaning all the parts, then I rinsed out the hopper with a garden hose. I'm not sure what happens to the paint in the hose itself.I give myself minus 3 stars for ruining my shirt, pants and hair!"
5,tools,"Great little product. Am renovating my home room by room, so I have painted only one room. Product wrkrd great. easy to understand instructions on use and clean up. In painting inside an occupied home, masking and attention to where you paint, and over spray is a given. I left the door open on the room I painted and a fine paint ""dust"" drifter across the hall into computer room. It wiped off easily and left no residue, as it was merely dust. Condition was as romised by seller and I received product in prompt timely manner.I reccomend this product highly. If one has a modicum on knowlege about painting or the user can understand instructions and has good common sense then this is a painter for you. I used a large spray painter in my maintenance business for many years, but this is a wonderful home product. Should last a very long time if used, cleaned, and maintained as instructed."
1,Junk,Bought this to paint our living room. My house has a very high ceiling so we though this would make it easier. It works great for 15 minutes and then it died. I have to go to Lowes to buy a Magnum paint sprayer in order to finish the job. The quality on this product is poor.
5,Randy Huston is great,I bet it's hard to be in such a niche market. Cowboy music that is good is such a small market.I love Randy's style & you can tell he lives the life.Great album.
5,There's a Hole in Daddy's Rope,"This is a truly wonderful and enjoyable collection of songs. Randy really knows the cowboy life, family values, the land and its people. His songs and performance of them are great and we enjoy listening to them frequently. Bought it for a friend as a birthday present and she loves it, too."
3,raw grunge,"where did it all begin? hear in this album nirvana's bleech it was the beging of the revelution for most music nowdays nirvana at there rawest its pretty good as well so check out it pplStand out songs: about a girl, school, negative creep"
4,strong debut,"this is Nirvana's debut album and most people heard it AFTER the media targeting of NEVERMIND, or incesticide, or even their best album, IN UTERO, that is why a large group do not like this album. You have to keep in mind that this is an album of a growing Nirvana...a more experimental Kurt Cobain, a diffrent sound of drums by chad channing, and an extra guitar. though it is not the Nirvana everyone is use to hearing, it is the begining for one of the best bands of all time, and it is a great sample of their future music with their grunge powered, anxious determination to set a course for themselves to be raw and to the point with musical drama only they can produce..."
5,An Indie Rock Classic,"I'll admit I wasn't to thrilled about this at first, yet in the end, this album has surpassed most of that other dusty Nirvana stuff. It's back when the band was toghether to have fun writing good music. We all know what happened next. They were a great act that wrote many tunes that just went straight to your soul. Buy ""Bleach"" and realize that this was how Nirvana was originally meant to sound. You will come to appreciate the fact that it is not another annoyingly hyped-to-death product like...oh, nevermind..."
5,BLEACH : Nirvana's best album *,"Great HEAVY ROCK cd. Nirvana was truly a great rock band, forget ""Teen Spirit"" for awhile, the ""grunge"" label and hype-they rocked, and Kurt was a great pure songwriter. This is beer can rock at it's best. I bet John Lennon would have loved Kurt's vocals, especially the (primal) screams. Jam packed with killer guitar riffs, tight and efficient pop melodies, killer hard rock-punk gems like ""Scoff"", ""Negative Creep"", ""Floyd The Barber"" and the funked out cover of ""Love Buzz"" are awesome. Nirvana's first album remains a stone cold classic, and one of the greatest debut records ever. Right up there with Cheap Trick's first or the first Doors album. Believe it!Bleach delivers the goods from start to finish. Recommended for anyone who likes to ROCK OUT."
4,RAW RAW NIRVANA!!!,"BLEACH is a great album, and one real raw one! Before the Masterpiece NEVERMIND, Nirvana was real punk with some heavy metal feeling! I really like BLEACH...It's raw, dirt, a real Grunge album!!!!!!"
4,the one that started it all,"It was the song S I F T I N G from Bleachthat spawned this book:220: S I F T I N G ~ The Alien Battle Royale or How we met the Spirit of Kurt CobainEven in his youth, Kurt is better than even when he is dead."
4,Refreshingly raw,"This is probably how Cobain & Co. wanted their band to sound in the first place.Bleach is less commercial, less polished, less mature, but in a way more charming than its descendants.Personally, I do prefer In Utero and Nevermind. But Bleach is hard to ignore as a very important step on the way of development of Nirvana's music."
4,Buy Bleach .. if you liked...,"Bleach is a good album, and one of my favorite. However, some dont like it, and if your wondering weather you will like it, I am here to solve your problem. If you heard Incesticide, there are a few of songs that you should pay attention to. These are Aero Zeppelin, Downer, Mexican Sea food, Hairspray Queen, Big Long Now, and Beezwax. If you liked these songs you will definetely like Bleach. These songs were written in the same period as Bleach songs, and recorded during the Bleach sessions. They just didint make it on to Bleach and were thrown onto Incesticide. About A Girl, the posthumous hit, is found on Bleach in its heavyrock form. Enjoy."
5,The Beginning,"This was Nirvana at their roots. Before they had a big record company to push them around, before they had to satisfy fans, and befor ""alternative."" I have loved Nirvana since i as 12, and this is their best album because it is pure. It is Cobain at his best and unleashed. This is before all the groupies started to chand at Smells Like Teen Spirit. This album is for the true Nirvana fans."
1,"If you say you like Bleach, you're lying","Boring, dull, and without any personality to speak of, Nirvana's debut is not worth owning. Every song has drifts unnoticeably into the background. It's basically white noise. The vocals are dull, and there is nothing even remotely off-kilter or creative to be found. No interesting song topics, no insightful revelations, no personal spin on the lyrics. Nothing on Bleach will make you think. Nirvana is not a ""thinking man's band"" like many wish they were (unless the lyrics ""cross says floss/smell the smell"" are too high-brow for you).A melange of records to buy instead of a Nirvana album:Beck: ""Mellow Gold""REM: ""Document""Smashing Pumpkins: ""Mellon Colliie""Spin Doctors: ""You've Got to Believe in Something""The Offspring: S/T, ""Ignition, and ""Smash""Oasis ""What's the Story"""
1,You get what you pay for,"I hate this album. Everybody says its raw, but that does NOT mean it is good. Any album with a ""raw"" sound is pathetic, because ""raw"" is just a euphimism for a half @ssed job. Come on, Kurt Cobain spent only $600 to make this record. The sound quality on this recording is absolutely terrible, it sounds like Kurt and the gang were playing their songs over the telephone. The instruments are completely muffled out by the cheap, tinny production. It doesn't even sound like music, it sounds more like Kurt Cobain screaming into the telephone while somebody in the background plays a bunch of distorted, muddy, incoherent guitar noise. I bet even YOU could acheive higher fidelity at home. Just pick up your guitar, and turn on a cheap tape recorder. Then play it back. See? I told you! Even home made recordings sound better than Nirvana!"
1,What a pungent pile of stinking excrement!,"I truly dispise this album. One star is far more than it deserves. If negative stars were an option I would have give it six hundred and sixty six of them.I got it in a bag of tapes that I bought off a guy at school.At the time Nirvana were really popular and grunge was in fashion so I decided to listen to it.My first impression on listening to it in it's entirety was that it was that it was the worst album I ever heard. I didn't WANT to hate this band or this album so I thought 'I'll give it a second chance'. I still could not find even a shred of good music on this album, so I sold it.This was one of the albums that made me hate grunge with the passion I do today!Now go and buy something good, please, just anything but grunge."
5,Nirvana's debut,"""Bleach"" is highly underrated. Sure it's not as anthematic as ""Nevermind"" or as focused as ""In Utero"" but it wasn't supposed to be. This is a fun punk record. Favorite songs: Blew, Paper Cuts, Big Cheese, Scoff, About a Girl, Sifting."
4,Borderline brilliance,"It's no wonder Bleach wasn't quite as succesful as Nevermind, but this not to say that what we have here is a brilliant rock album and a msut have for any grunge/alt.rock fans. There is no ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" here, but most of the songs display enough melody to keep taunting you after trhe lsitening experience. For some alt.rock fans Bleach might actaully be more entertaining to listen to compared to Nevermind, since this is not quite as clean-cut or radio-friendly produced as Nevermind."
3,First Album,"""Nevermind was better, but not much better"" I remember reading somewhere, I think that guy was spot on. Very raw, Grunge/Punk. This is late 80's when Nirvana were still a garage band. (You can just tell) Yeah, this album did cost about $600 to make. Love Buzz, School, and Floyd the Barber, are great. Although some songs near the end arent. Only get this if your a die hard Nirvana fan, and want to hea something other than Smells Like Teen Spirit."
3,"Not the best, but still great","No, it's not Nirvana at it's best (that accolade surely goes to In Utero, or even Unplugged in New York), though it is a good album. It is heavier, and possibly got a more emotional value to it than any of the others, and About A Girl would have to rate as one of my favourite songs of all time, but next to the rest of my Nirvana collection, Bleach is just average."
3,First Try,"Kurt and the gang are like kids in a toy store, on their first album ""Bleach"".They go in so many directions not knowing what they want they want to experience everything at once.Its very raw and hard hitting.This is very True. But Kurt lacks his strong melodies. Some may disagree and that is fine.About a Girl , School are the best songs on the album.While Floyd the Barber is very nightmarish and haunting.Overall In Utero is Nirvanas best Kurt said it himself if you dont believe me look it up in the march issue of Guitar World.Anyway Bleach is worth your money just to hear Kurt belt out a few more tunes. ITs rough unpolished and grtitty."
3,Raw... but could have been sooo much better!,"Bleach is Nirvana in their raw and unpolished form...t could have been so much rawer... Had they NOT included ANY chad channing tracks... He's such a weak drummer. The three Dale Crover tracks just kick the others song's ass. There are a lot more Dale Crover songs available on Incesticide and the Box set.Of course, Dave Grohl is an entirely diffrent story. But he's the ultimate Nirvana Drummer. Imagine what bleach would had sound like, if they already had him on board."
5,"the raw, tough genesis of Nirvana","These songs start to sound brilliant after a few listens. Maybe it's just because of the place Nirvana occupies in the collective consciousness, but this first album of theirs illustrates, for me, the dark and important waves that fueled their entire career. Many fans insist that this is Nirvana's best album ever. It is definitely good, powerful, passionate."
3,"This album is raw, noisy grunge at its finest","Bleach was the first full length Nirvana album. This album was recorded before the days of Dave Grohl's power drumming, but it is still a good album. This album can be described a down-tuned guitars crunching with simple dynamics and good lyrics. Kurt Cobain on this album uses many singing voices between songs like Dive, About A Girl and Love Buzz, some of the album's best songs. About A Girl really shines through as a Beatlesque melody and wonderful lyrics about Kurt's girlfriend who wanted him to get a steady job. This pre-grunge revolution will be welcomed by hardcore Nirvana fans, but first timers should invest in classics like Nevermind and In Utero."
3,Deserves points for effort.,"Bleach is by no means a ""good"" album, it is also by no means a ""bad"" album. How much you like this album depends on a few things:1) How devoted you are to Nirvana, the space between Bleach and Nevermind shows almost inhuman growth.2) You love of screech metal Kurt never quite was a powerful vocalist, but he can growl and screech, and believe me, he willand finally 3) your trash tolerance just how much thrash metal can you stomach?Bleach is listenable for a while, but it quickly spirals into random noise. Deffinitly not Nirvana's best, but okay for a listen ..."
4,Better than most first efforts.,"For a debut, especially on such a small budget, this is really good. It isn't at the same level as their later works so they can't be compared very well; but if I had to, it is most similar to the second half of Incesticide. It shows Nirvana's roots in punky garage music. I got this when I was about 12 and here it is ten years later and I still like it. Sure, it's not heavy radio play material, but it's great for rockin' out in your car or cleaning the house or something.If you're a so-so Nirvana fan, listen mostly to the Best Of and Unplugged, this will probably not be your favorite and maybe you should save your cash (even though some songs from Unplugged are on this). But if you're really into all their stuff you'll probably get into this. But if that's true you most likely already have it.Anyway, if all my CDs got stolen and I could only replace so many, I would get this again."
2,Underground vs Radio Play,"Nirvana was NOT the original band to pull grunge out of the popluations' pockets. Bleach was an underground compilation that was never publicized until later. Alice In Chains, though, hit the radio waves 11 months before Nirvana did, with ""Facelift"", which was released on August 28, 1990, while Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" was released on September 24, 1991. So who can honestly prove that Nirvana was the origin of grunge???"
1,"good music, unfortunately very poor packaging",I bought this since it is one of all time must haves. Unfortunately the lp record is warped due to poor packaging practice. LP was sent in a box loosely packed with bubble pack and not sent properly in a vinyl cardboard sleeve. Unplayable now. I use this to showcase my friends new to vinyl how warped records look if it is packaged improperly during delivery. It costed more to send it back than keep it. Thanks but no thanks Amazon.
1,crap,"this is the ""worst album in the world ever...3"" the other albums are brilliant but this is soooo boring!.i know that without this album there would be no other nirvana stuff and that it is all about progression but did they have to start soooo low down and then shoot up the scale?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM,"This album is horribleDon't show the talent and creativeness that is inNevermind, In Utero, and UnpluggedThe only sort of good songs are ""downer"" and thelast three tracksIf you are in to Nirvana you SHOULD BUY:Nevermind (1991), In Utero (1993), andUnplugged (1994)Do not buy:Incesticide (1992), From the Muddy... (1996), andNirvana (2002)These albums are full of bad lyrics and rereleasedtracks"
1,POOR EXCUSE FOR MUSIC,"I don't find grunge the least bit inspiring, and this serves to confirm that view. Nothing but excessive guitars, repetitive chord sequences and out of tune singing. Not for the intellectual music listener."
1,"What hell is this album? Silly, horrible, junk, noisy.","This first attempt from Cobain and the gang is horrible. Raw, tuneless, amelodic, endlessly repetitive grunge trash. (""Negative Creep"" is a perfect example. Hey, let's scream ""Johnny's little girl ain't a girl no more"" about ten zillion times, and call it a song.)I actually like some of Nirvana's later stuff. But all in all, the grunge movement was a bust. Thank God it's all but gone now. It sure wore out its welcome fast. Now, back to constructing actual melodies and harmonies, OK?"
1,Listen to the samples before buying. It's awful!,"No matter what anybody says, Nirvana's Bleach is sub-par by even the most general standards of music And no, Kurt can't get off the hook for being dead, because a lot of what he made in life was awful. Sure, Kurt and da boyz got the best sound $600.17 could buy, but it still sounds like (...). Does Bleach sound good compared to Soundgarden's first SubPop EP? No. Does it have variety to the sound of the songs? No. Is there any creativity in any of the songs? No... unless you consider shouting ""Gimme back my babyback ribs... um, I mean 'alcohol'"" twnty times in one song as being creative. In ""Aero Zepplin"", Kurt was right when he said rock stars can ""(...) upon the stage and they'll be fans"", because it's so true. Rock stars like Kurt can get away with anything. His fans really would pay to buy an album of forty straight minutes of Kurt having a bowel movement, because Bleach is that bowel movement."
5,GREAT!,"I think this is Nirvanas best album. Its there 1st and best in my opinion. This is a great cd for Nirvana fans but for the people that are getting into them they might not like it, definatly a cd where you like it or are confused by it. Good over all but I just wish they had Grohl for this one, Channing's okay but Grohl is one of the greatest."
3,"Some bad, some good","Anyone who says this cd is Cobain at his purest is so mistaken. These songs are rough, some gems are there (about a girl, school), but there's a lot of filler and even more white noise. It's a good cd, but their next few albums destroys this completely."
3,"An about average grunge CD, coincidentally by Nirvana","For $600 this is class, but overall not a match for the later albums. The first side is superb, with some neat brief lyrcis and some pounding grungy guitars, but much of the second havlf after Negative Creep is very indistict and sort of blurs into one messy stodge. But School, Love Buzzz, Negatvie Creep and Downer are class. In reality it's no surprise that the much better Nevermind was the album to break them, as while this has some class Soundgarden and Mudhoney were doing better things at the time"
5,Bleach!no need another feed!,"Bleach,the first album of Nirvana.If u r a real Nirvana fan,u have to have this album!"
4,"Pure, unrelenting, raw, BRILLIANT...","To Danny from Aberdeen, Washington: No one starts at the top friend, as your cries in your review suggest. If Nirvana made it big with ""Bleach,"" they would have suffered the ""sophomore slump"" with ""Nevermind."" The songs on ""Bleach"" are pure, brilliant Curt Cobain (or Kurdt Kobain, as it appears on the album,) writing. ""Floyd the Barber,"" my favorite, reminds me of the fear I felt in my first haircut, or the story of Sweeney Todd. Anyway, give this one a try, and don't listen to those who think they can strike it rich on the first try...how arrogant. They'll only crash and burn early, like Leann Rhimes. Heh heh."
2,The Beginning,"Nirvana has proven to be the most influential rock band of the current rock era. On this CD you can very much hear the hints of something brand new being born, something clearly demonstrated in ""About A Girl"" and ""Scoff"", but through the rest of the album they seem to be searching for that revolutionary sound. I'm not in any way lowering their status as musicians, but I am saying that this album was a prototype, and just as Beethoven labored endlessly through draft upon draft upon draft to reach his desired sound this too shows that process. ""Bleach"" seems, to me, to be more of a draft of a new sound rather than the new sound itself. On more of a side note I almost detected some Metallica influences in this album, particularly in regards to some of the drumming and choppy guitar breaks that are not as prevelant in later Nirvana albums."
4,If you're already a fan!,"If you're just gonna pick up a Nirvana CD to have some of their music in their library than this isn't for you. Don't expect Nevermind or In Utero here. You can tell that this is very experimental and raw. The only song I find very unique and outstanding is About a Girl. It sounds like a Beatles song, but that doesnt' detract from it. Recommended to fans of Nirvana."
4,Bleach rocks like a mutha... and it does it well.,"If you're going to get a Nirvana album, definitely start with Bleach. It has an aggressiveness and a in-your-face honesty that Nevermind and In Utero lacked. On Bleach, Kurt and company didn't care about money like they did with the Nevermind and In Utero tours. All they cared about was playing live and taking a giant road trip across the country. And if they were lucky enough to sleep on a few fans' floors and get paid in a case of beer, then they felt all the more rewarded. It's really disappointing to see other people trying to make more out of Bleach than it really is though. This album isn't an artistic statement or a ""tuneful approximation of what grunge should sound like"". All Bleach does sets out to do is rock like a mutha... and it does it well.Highlights: ""Negative Creep"", ""Sifting"", and ""Paper Cuts""May the heaviness be with you."
3,Eh.,"I'm with the person that gave this three and a half stars.I probably would have liked it much better if Dave Grohl had been in the band. Its good, but the drumming is just weak. One of my favorite things about Nirvana is just the noise of it. Or maybe that didn't sound that right. The sound. And a key part of that sound is the drumming. Its not given that much credit, but when you have Chad Channing on the drums and not Dave, it just doesn't work.Sure, there are a few songs that are okay, but nothing *great.**deep nod*Okay. It grows on you, though. Its nothing special, but its okay.But its Nirvana, which makes it good, eh, my lover-ly Blink-182 fans?[/sarcasm]"
3,Nirvana's first CD,"Bleach was Nirvana's first CD. There really only are a few memorable songs, such as About a Girl, Downer, and Negative Creep. You may enjoy the 80's-ness of the others, but they really don't do well with repeat listens. If you're a true Nirvana fan, you'll own this album, but otherwise, choose carefully."
3,more grunge and depression,nirvana made a album with many debts to Black Sabbath and KISS its not bad but could be a cliche of the seventies.
2,Sycophantic fans,"of Kurt Cobain will eat up this messy, plodding, mostly uninteresting album. The rest of us will be glad someone gave their sound and their image a shave and a shower. Do not think that you will find the kernels of ""Nevermind"" here. ""About a Girl"" and ""Negative Creep"" are the only standouts here, maybe a few others are kinda sorta ok. For a much better ""grunge"" debut, if you must have one, Mudhoney's ""Superfuzz Bigmuff"" is a much better buy. Or, if you really want some rawer, less slick Nirvana, ""Incesticide"" is what you want. ..."
2,Its ok,Out of all the nirvana albums this one is the most interesting. Unfortunately it is definately no the best one. I am a great fan of nirvana songs but i must say i hate a ton of them. A lot of this heavy crap only helped to fuel the end of rock. On this album the only songs worth listening to are lovebuzz and about a girl. A much better CD is the unplugged one. it has a better acoustic sound that shows the talent nirvana truly had
4,Review Under Forced Servitude to an English Dude,"4.5 stars, to be exact. The counter doesn't allow decimals, but it would be a sin punishable by the Hammurabai penal code to give this a score less than a 4.5.This is possibly one of my favourite Nirvana CDs, it's also their first album, produced by Sub-Pop. I enjoy this CD because it embodies the darker side of Nirvana: the highly cynical, mutually indifferent aspects. Although the lyrics are somewhat difficult to comprehend, it's not difficult to relate to the raw energy that the three-piece rock group radiates. If you are an artist, I guarantee you'll like this CD."
5,Debut Album is a very undderated gem.,"This album is the most grundiest out of all nirvana's albums. I am a huhe nirvana fan and own about 21 of their cds and 3 vhs/dvd's and i will admit alot of nirvana is not grundge music. But htis is so if u like the bands like the melvins mudhoney alice in chains this is a great buy for you. This shows a young talented Cobain trying 2 find his voice. And wut i love about Cobain is he has so many different voices. This album is a must hav 4 any nirvana fan, and if u r new 2 nirvana and like the hard sludgier sound i would even say to but his over nevermind."
3,average music from an average band,"""Bleach"" is nowhere near Nirvana's later efforts ""Nevermind"" and ""In utero"". On this album, one would have never thought Kurt Cobain would inherit the musical status he has today. An intersting album to see where the band started and where it finished but by no means a musical breakthrough.On the other hand, for those who despise the commerciality of ""Nevermind"" this album is genuine and sounds like a live entertaining band."
2,The only Nirvana album I own,"Bleach is a decent enough punk album. But to say that Kurt Cobain is a guitar legend and did more for music than any other musician is blatant lying. He just happened to hit at a time when things were already changing. The truth of the matter is that they didn't hit the mark near as close as early '90s bands such as Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. If you want a truly ground-breaking album from the early '90s, get MetallicA. But don't over praise Cobain."
1,About an album,"In short, Bleach is for hardcore Nirvanaphiles and completists only. It contains one noteworthy song- About a Girl- which is surrounded by almost a dozen forgettable, two-minute punk rock tracks with childish lyrics. It wouldn't be until 1991 that Nirvana would assemble an album that not only sounded great, but was comprised almost entirely of catchy, memorable songs. Bleach, unfortunately, is the complete opposite."
4,Good Buy,"Being a big fan of Nirvana of course I bought this it is very not many people even know about this and only know of the big commercial sucess Nevermind which is great but we've got ourselves a gem here.It's very underrated.The highlights to me on this album were ""Blew"" and ""About A Girl"".So all in all it is definetly a good album and great buy."
5,A Great Cable Knitting Tip Included!,"I love the EZ method of making a project your own, with your yarn at your gauge. That said, I did like the bit more hand-holding that this DVD provides for the written instructions in Meg Swansen's Handknitting book. I am an experienced knitter, I knit cables without a cable needle, but yet, there was a very clever tip on this DVD about knowing when it is time to cross the stitches. It made the DVD completely worth the little extra expense. Plus there are kitties and you get a taste of Meg's design process. If you want to make this lovely vest, I'd highly recommend getting this DVD."
1,Poor quality,"I used this headset approximately 12 times, over a two year period. One of the earpieces broke away from the headband, exposing the wires, making it impossible to repair. I thought the company would stand behind the quality of such a high rated, not to mention a high priced device. They were not misused in anyway and now, after only a dozen times of using the headset, I'm out almost $300. I wouldn't want this to happen to someone else."
1,just a heads up; this is NOT militia's Cartel,"just a quick heads up; this is NOT the same cartel that wrote and recorded ""ransom EP"" or ""Chroma"". This is a different, weird foreign group. i bought ""saftey in numbers"" without checking the cartel discovery first, and i wasted my money. if you're looking for material from the militia band cartel, get ransom or chroma."
4,Good lawyer stories,"This book has 7 short stories involving a father-and-son law firm in NYC. Some of them involve long courtroom scenes, while others take place in the firm's office and other locations. The author writes very well and sometimes goes into detail about law. I figured that he must have been a lawyer, so I looked him up, and he was. He likes to use subtle humor, which helps a lot in making the stories enjoyable. None of the stories are wonderful, but most are pretty good and make entertaining reading."
4,Anahi,Es un disco de onda juvenil tiene una voz agradable lo conceptuo comoun disco semejante a RBD ya que ella es parte del grupo y el ritmo sigueesa trayectoria. Creo que ese disco o una cancion de el ya había salidoaños atras lo que me atrajo a comprarlo ya que había visto el video de promocion y me había gustado mucho.
2,There are better choices...,"After listening to a couple of tracks, I was very disappointed in this CD. Nothing prepared me for a collection of live performances recorded from Tom's TV appearances. Even though there are quite a few tracks on this CD, I'm not sure I would have forked over (money) for it (...). The instrumentation is weak, but Tom belts out each tune with the same enthusiasm which makes him the legend he is... Buy something else!"
4,Romeo and Juliet Texan Style.,"Noah and Martina captured my heart and soul with their heart-wrenching, families' dramas. They both had to overcome 'loveless' childhoods and learn that love makes one a better person. Great plot, characters and catchy yet realistic dialogue.Leanne, you did an amazing job with this Coltrane-Logan saga. Kudos to you!"
4,Scale,"This fast weigh scale is not only cheap, but portable and lightweight as well, it has a blue LED so illuminate any spices or herbs, and tobacco measurements"
3,It is compact,I like the Fast Weight. The draw back is not consistance from weight item to the next. I have to reset that over and over.
5,Thanks,Got here quick and works great. Had a easy time figuring it out. Its really accurate and i enjoy this product.
4,TINY,"small itty bitty tiny insignificant hardly even there. Works good, but seriously, this is a tiny scale. keep that in mind."
4,Recommend This Product,Smaller than I expected when it arrived but it works perfectly. I recommend this product.
2,Two days,Well I had this for two days and it need to be recalibrated. Spend a few extra dollars and get a better one.
2,Do not trust accuracy,"Very cheaply made and questionable regarding the accuracy of the scale. I intended to use it for weighing gold and other precious goods. The scale will certainly fit into your pocke. Looking at the price of the scale, I should have known the quality of this product would be inferior. The seller does have a large variety of other scales that I'm sure are of higher quaility. The seller was very prompt in delivering my order and processing my return."
3,crazy scale,"This scale is ok, it's small and lightweight which makes it easy to carry in a pocket. The scale does not seem to be very accurate though, my first few attempts at weighing, wound up in the scale giving me some insane measurements, almost like something was interfering with it. I thought when I purchased my scale that they where brand new, but from the looks of mine you can clearly see a spot rubbed off on the face of the plate from use. If you don't need to be really accurate in you measurements this scale would be good choice."
4,Good product.,This product helps me accurately determine the weight of each of my arrow tips for my bow. Its really helpful when trying to get each of your arrows to be identical. I would strongly recommend this scale for anyone that needs to determine the weight of anything without spending a lot of money. Still works strong after almost a year of use. Backlight is also very nice.
3,"OK, but not the accuracy needed","I'm team manager for a Destination Imagination structure team. This is a great little scale for diets and where accuracy is not critical. The team is getting inconsistent readings for small weights (will not show any weight then pop up to .6 grams, etc.) It's design also makes it difficult to add a larger tray for weighing their structure since it tends to rest on or cover the display. They didn't think they needed a .001 accurate scale, but they now need to upgrade. At least it doesn't cost much."
3,"Small, but gets the job done","This little scale is very small.. almost too small to put a plate on to actually weigh any food items, but it works. It's compact, lightweight, and great for travel as well."
5,Mini Digital Scale,Good product for the small amount of money. It's great for weighing small and light items that require presice meashuring.I like the digital feature particularly as well as the size of the scale.
4,Very good scale,I must say that this scale has met its expectations. I delivers acurate readings and is easy to carry around. The price is a winner as well.
5,All around great deal,"This was a great deal, the supplier is awesome, the scale was mint in the box, perfect working condition, I have seen other scales like this for WAY more, very happy with purchase."
5,Great little pocket scale,Very accurate little scale. Comes with a cover to keep it clean. Don't let the low price fool you. This is a great little scale. I recommend this highly.
4,"Fast Weigh MS-500-BLK Digital Pocket Scale, 500 by 0.1 G","i order this pocket scale but the send me the this oneAmerican Weigh Scale Fast Weigh M-600 Digital Pocket Scale, Black, 600 X 0.1 Ganyway this scale works fine... it is little and accuarate.."
5,Just what I was looking for,"This scale was just what I was looking for. A small, inexpensive, accurate digital scale to weigh small amounts of Homebrewing ingredients. This scale does the job. The zero'ing feature works good.Would definitively recommend."
5,excellent,"this is a very very good scale, I got it 21 days ahead of schedule (today 2/6/12), and its Great! works very well"
5,Awesome for the 5 dollar price,This is a awesome scale for the price. I use it for random things like weighing bullets and gun power.. ECT ;)
4,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good scale for the price, I'll give it about a year. Which is still good. I weighed a penny (which is 2.5 grams) to make sure it weighed right and it did! It can be a little off sometimes so just make sure you weigh whatever your weighing a few times to make sure. Other than that great product!"
4,"ordered MS-500, got MS-600","First, oder was placed at 2 AM on 12/29/12, just got it 1/2/ 13 (I live in the NE of US).Second, weighs a nickel at 5.0g, then, before I could breathe, 5.1g-steady, tare-4.9g; a penny became 2.6g, dropped to 2.7g then tared and got 2.5g sliding to 2.6g.Third, as the title states ""ordered MS-500, got MS-600"", literally.All things considered, great price, quick shipping, item was described 98% accurate (new in box, instructions, warranty, etc.)Really want to give item/seller a 4.7-4.85555555555556, obviously can't."
4,"Not exactly as pictured, but works very well","The scale that I received varied slightly in appearance, but it's still a very good value. I've had it for several months now, and it still works perfectly after frequent use. Since it's only accurate to tenths of a gram it may not be precise enough for all uses, but it's very simple, rugged and functional. There's not much more you can ask out of a scale. Don't let the bargain price fool you, this scale is a wonderful choice for most purposes."
4,Easy to use,"Works great for coffee beans. I set this thing on the counter, turn the lid from my coffee grinder upside down on it, press the button on the right to ""tear"" off the weight of the grinders lid, then weigh out my coffee beans. Once they're weighed I just dump them in the grinder and grind away."
3,Cheap & Accurate,This is good for the price. The scale is compact and does just fine. The price was worth it. If you just need a compact accurate scale to double check the dispensaries this is right for you. This would be ideal for you avrage lament consumer.
4,Ok for measuring grams only,It measures out really well actually. I wouldn't use it that much for things under .5 grams because it gets very fritzy in those areas but for the money it's well worth it.
3,"works well, but very small","seems to be working fine, but I didn't realize how small it is (size of a deck of cards).Being that small makes it hard to place item on top"
3,not the item I recieved,This is not the item I received when I thought I was ordering it. I received the MS-600 600 X 0.1g scale that uses a 500g calibration weight and not a 200g one. Would have liked to know that before I bought the 200g weight. Please update this product!
3,more like slow weigh,Amazingly fast shipping! The scale itself is what you'd expect from a 7 dollar scale. It takes a really long time to zero out when you turn it on.
4,"Pretty good, i like it",if ur not a picky person who dosnt mind being off like a gram most then this scale is great for u
3,Small and cute,"This product def does what it's meant to do. Quality isnt that good, but like I said, does its job :)"
5,solid scale,"scale works fine, not the most accurate, but very close for the price it is a great deal"
4,Good scale for the price and size,This scale performed as expected. I use it to weigh coins and it is good to .1 grams. The only thing to note is it is very small.Overall - a good scale for the money.
1,alright,"I bought this and works well, but it goes through batteries fast. The batteries that came with it new, didn't work. I put new duracell batteries into it then weight things. Decided to weigh things the next day and the batteries were dead. Scale came on and flashed that it was a low battery and then went off. It did this a few times until I decided to just take the batteries out when i'm not using it. works well like that and i've read that other people have the same problem on other websites and even amazon."
5,perfect size,i ordered this 2 weigh jewelry ordered online and it works great ! the cover acts as a tray for holding loose items without fear of loss also great buy
3,Decent for the price.,"For the price it is pretty decent.However, it is off by a little bit. It comes with instructions on how to calibrate it, but you need a 500g calibration weight.I dont have it, but when I weigh a nickel it comes out as 5.1g and a nickel is supposed to be 5g.so it is off by a little bit, but i dont mind that much. I wish it was accurate out of the box like my old one was though."
1,Not worth it!!,"Received the scale, set up was easy. Just pull out the plastic strip from battery and its ready to use. Further when I performed a small test to check the accuracy of the scale, the scale got 1 star rating.Here is what I did.Picked 2 Quarter Dollar coins, weighed the first one 5.7 grams, weighed the second 5.6 grams, when I put both coins together on the scale combined weight was 10.6 grams instead of 11.3 grams. Based on these observation for me this scale was not worth buying in case you are looking for precision as advertised (i.e. 0.1 G) ."
1,Get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for with this product. Very inaccurate will jump 1-2 grams just from picking up the object your weighing and placing it back on the scale, no weight change, but the scale seems to think there was..."
1,"Not precise... cheap, of course.","I should know better... cheap scale... doesnt work!! I needed something to weight very light things. This will pick up if I blow into it, but wont weight something less than 10grams! Not 0.1g!!"
5,Handy scale,I bought this scale to weigh coins - mostly pennies. It is a GREAT scale. Came already calibrated so don't recalibrate it. Works fine. Does shut off quickly but I am ok with that since it is saving the battery. Arrived QUICKLY from the seller.
5,Great,"A very reasonablely priced digital scale in a small size. I am very impressed with it's accuracy, and very much in it's abilities."
4,This scale is great for brewers!,"I purchased this scale to weigh out dried malt extracts, hops and other ingredients to my home brews. It works very well and I like the fact it swicthes from grams or ounces. I like that you can place a container on it and then with a press of a button re-zero it to measure the goods. sometimes when you have a bowl on the weighing surface, you have to look at the digital screen on an angle and it can be hard to read but if you know the right way to look at it, no big deal. For the price, it's a great little tool that I use on each and every home brew I create."
3,Much Smaller Than I Expected!,"I don't know why, but I expected this scale to be a little bigger than a shirt pocket. It's great for weighing small snack food, such as nuts, berries, etc., but to weigh deli meats and larger items it is just too difficult. I guess it was pretty cheap and very accurate, so if you need it for small items, then you can't beat it. If you want to weigh larger items, you might want to step up to something a little bit larger. It is nice for traveling, because it is small, but I think it will have limited usefulness."
4,"So far, very good!","We bought this item to weight artemia cysts for our breeding facilities.We have used it very little, but for the price we think its acurate enough.The item is very small, maybe smaller than the palm of your hand., it seems fragil it comes already with AAA batt. (needs 2 to work. The shipping was very slow (we applied for free shipping)and what was supposed to be one package turned to be 2 thanks to the slow delivery."
4,worth the money,"This scale is great for small amounts of weight past .5 grams. i use it to weigh my ""herbs"" and it does a great job, stays calibrated. the only issue is that sometimes it takes the scale a minute to realize there's even weight on it. However that only happens on occasionally, so if your friends want to buy some herb this is great for transport and gets the job done. overall i was pleased."
4,Great price!,"for what it is, its great. However my only problem with it is that it has to be completely level to function properly, and I mean COMPLETELY LEVEL."
1,not worth buying! i returned it.,"As in the title, not worth buying! too small to put on anything on it"
2,Not sensitive enough,"I'm a bit disappointed with this scale. First off, it's a nice scale as long as you're not weighing anything less than 0.1 oz. Anything less than that, forget it. It does not measure 0.01 oz as this listing claims. My scale works perfectly fine, weighed a U.S. quarter and it came out with the correct 20 oz."
4,Pretty Good For Light Use,"I definately would not use this commercially, but good for estimatated coin weight. I was happy with what I bought! Thanks!"
5,fantastic,"I am really happy with this product. It arrived very quickly, and it is even nicer than I expected. Seller and item are highly recommended."
2,Scale Reviewer,"This product came in the mail very fast. It is also very simple to use, BUT it will not give you an accurate read every time. I have calibrated it over 20 times and it still gives varying weight. Not much but still different reads. Ranging from 4.5-5.2gs. Would not recommend this product even though the price is very reasonable."
3,nice but too pocket,"I arrived into the US 2 weeks ago. I wanted to make a cake but I am not able to use ""cup"" as a unit weight. So I needed a kitchen scale. I bought this one only for the low price. It's nice but really pocket."
2,"Not too bad, but not too good either.","It's pretty cool for how much it is, but, the only problem, it doesn't weigh correctly, which is a big problem. But, it's not a bad product overall. I still use it even if it's a tad bit off, so it's handy to have for as cheap as it is."
3,WORKED great but not so much a month later,It started off fine and worked as is should but now it wont weigh small objects without having something large on the scale already and subtracting the remaining amount. Im just going to buy a 50 dollar one i guess the price was to good to be true.
1,Broken on delivery,"Scale constantly reads 0.0g no matter what amount of weight is placed on it. Unable to enter ""calibrate"" mode as per instructions."
3,False Advertising,"Scale I received was actually an ""American Weigh Scale Fast Weigh M-600 Digital Pocket Scale, Black, 600 X 0.1 G"" Sold by: EZ-SELL.Still a good scale but not the product advertised."
4,"Very Small, Lightweight","This scale was much smaller than I anticipated, which is great for me. Works right out of box, though you should always get a 500g calibration weight."
3,Made by China,"It is a rather cheap scale. If you live in cold weather the scale will glitch out, jumping around weights. It pisses me off at times. But it does get the job done. If your looking for a cheap scale to weight out small items and have an ideal measurement this is the scale for you. To my experience it has been pretty darn close to what it says it is."
4,practical scale,"it works great. the only problem i had was that it wouldnt turn on initially. i just had to adjust the batteries a little bit but it worked great after that. and its really small, about the size of a deck of cards."
2,Better ones out there,The scale was shipped fine and came quickly in mail.I have calibrated it many times and it always jumps off about .2 after weighing a couple times.This may not sound like a big deal but .2 nuggets of gold add up and i cant afford the loss.
1,pos dont buy,this only worked for one night before it got outa whack and needed weights to be calibrated dont buy this pos
1,Piece of junk,I didn't expect much for the low price and it disappointed for sure. Did not even work out of the box. Don't even think about wasting your money on this thing.
2,ok,"its hard to use and doesnt look like the picture. it needs a flat surface but it does work, hopefully it doesnt drain batteries too fast"
3,works,fair price decently accurate and conveniently small weighed a penny with it and it came to 2.4 grams which is close enough for me
2,It's alright.,I was really surprised on how big the package was. The scale is really really small. The seller should have said it was pocket size.The callbriation was difficult to do. Maybe it was me. But it took me a while. It wasn't for another person writing a review saying a penny was 2.5g I wouldnt be able to do itxIt's a good price but extremely small. I hope I can trust it!
3,Iffy,"Scale seems to change weight at random by around 3 grams. requires a 500g weight to calibrate, which was not mentioned anywhere."
5,Great little device,It even came with the batteries. Useful fo weighing small items - I use it to weigh small balls of yarn.
1,Pocket Scale,I can't get it to calibrate correctly and therefore have not been able to use it. Waste of money and time.
3,Didn't come with calibration weight??,I'm not quite sure if it doesn't come with a 500 gram calibration weight or if I just didnt get one..kind of sucks because without it being calibrated it really doesn't work...the things awesome..super small nice and accurate if you put something heavy on it but because its not calibrated I really cant measure out .1 or .2 grams of a substance because it just doesn't register...500g calibration weights are kindof expensive too. :(
2,not that good,"doesnt calibrate, so really useless. i out something 3.5 ounces. cane to 14.5grams. WOULDNT RECOMEND. fast shipping though. dont buy your scale from here, for whatever the need"
5,Amazing little scale,Amazing little scale. Does exactly what I need to measure out coffee for french press or pour over. The price was really good. When it came it was super easy to use and already calibrated.
5,Perfect Lil Scale!,The first thing I did was find someting in my house in grams so that I could test the accurateness of it with. And it tested well + or - 1 gram or so.
4,accurate,"As my title reads this is what it is. Accurate to the .1 ... Not very large, so keep aware of that."
3,OK...,works sometimes but other times it just glitches up. the good thing it that you can tell when it glitches but it still glitches
5,good buy,"Great buy.Small,compact but does the job -love the different modes where u can switch fro m grams to ounces etc.."
3,Too Small,its too small for anything. I tried weighing chicken on it but it doesn't fit. I would like my money back.
3,its cute,"doesnt seem to be properly calibrated.Weighs different every time. But, it was very inexpensive so what do you expect? However, the transaction was smooth and quick. Would buy from them again."
2,Its ok but the Fast weigh is not fast,It is slow to weigh. after i put the stuff on the fast weigh it weighs slow althought i think its accurate. the Fast weight is very slow to react.
5,Works perfect.,"This scale works perfectly. It's nice, compact, and easy to use. No complaints. The price point is good as well."
5,Good Product,"The size of this pocket scale is approximately the same size as a deck of playing cards. It measures in G, Oz, dwt, ozt. Calibration was very accurate from the factory, a 500g weight measured at 499.9g. The appropriate calibration weight is 500g. Seems to be of a good quality. Includes two AAA heavy duty batteries. Can weigh envelopes using the cover which doubles as a expansion weight tray. I am happy with this purchase."
4,Great for the price.,"It is an awesome product for the price. It does what it is supposed to do and is portable. It isn't so good at weighing large amounts due to surface area, but that its only problem."
4,Small but accurate scale,"I thought it was going to be larger but this scale really is a 'pocket' model. It's accurate to 0.1gram.For the price, it really is a GREAT deal. Its limitations seem to be how much weight it can handle (500g) and the accuracy but to get accuracy of 0.01 or better, the price really jumps up.It worked for me right out of the box and I would suggest it this model. It truly was a great value and I got free shipping to boot."
4,Very nice and good size,"Very nice For 8 bucks. Its seriously pocket size.( it was smaller than expected, which is good). when i first got it it was off .2g's and the calibration weigh is more than the scale. but its perfect after i calibrated it. Shipping was also fast."
2,MORE LIKE FAST SHUTOFF!!!!!!,"it will not registar 1-3 grams unless you have lid on (which weighs 9.1 grams) and tare it out! IF U WANT A GOOD SCALE, dont buy this one!!!!!!!!!! also it will shut off in like 1-2 minutes in the middle of a weigh!!!!!!!!!Fast Weigh MS-500-BLK Digital Pocket Scale, 500 by 0.1 G"
2,Not quite. I guess I got what I paid for...,"I had intended to use this to weigh out fish food currently at .5 gram. I ran several tests when I bought it because it wasn't even picking up the measurement. It turned out that this scale didn't even register until I had 1.2 + grams of weight on it. Specifically, I have toothpics which weigh approx .4 grams. It repeatedly took 3-4 toothpics to get the scale to move off zero - and jump to 1.2 - 1.6 grams. I don't know about accuracy at higher weights, but it sure doesn't work for what I bought it for."
5,Excellent,This product is wonderful we use it in our family Owned jewelry store so I will definitely be purchasing more you can't beat the price
5,simple and effective,"picked up this item to be able to weigh small amounts of precious metals should i need to work a trade or make a purchase. I didn't want to bust the bank given that it would see little use,but did need a product which could be depended on.This fast weigh scale is the perfect compromise. Great price, small and compact (size of a cigarette case), and seems accurate. I weighed a few rings and bits and the scale seemed accurate. It does need to be zeroed. I allowed it to shut off and double checked weights which all seem consistent in reading.I have used a larger kitchen scale for measuring vitamins and stuff, which worked but was cumbersome for the minute quantities. This works better.I will keep this scale in my emergency supplies in the event that a bartering system should replace paper currency, but given the low probability of that occurring it will also double as my desk toy plaything and occasional vitamin weigher companion."
4,I like it,"The scale is handy and it looks smart. Just one problem, it cannot weigh things more than 500 grams and if you need to hold your food in a bowl, it is hard to weigh it."
3,too small,when I purchased this scale I didnt realize how small it was until I recvd it honestly i was gonna return it but decided to keep it
3,**If buying from Newcool Store** They re-tare whenever they feel like it.,"This review is for scales bought from Newcool Store. This seller used to have the actual Fast-weigh M-500, but they ran out at some point and only sell some other scale that looks close enough to it.Good for the price. It's better to buy around ten of them and sell them to people for $10-15. It's not better to use one as your own scale. Too many of them are slightly off. You can test this by weighing a nickel, which should be a 5.0. If your scale shows 4.9 or something, you can kind of fix it by pressing down on the weighing surface past the 500g limit for half a minute. Nothing can fix the occasional re-taring they do. Which is especially annoying when you're almost at how much you need to weigh out and the weight displayed suddenly drops or completely zeroes.Conclusion: Buy a nicely sized batch if you want to sell them to aspiring drug dealers and not if you are one."
2,i shouldve spent a little bit more money,"the scale costs $5, that should tell you enough. it doesnt come with a calibration weight and it turns off while you are still using it! also, the surface to weigh things is very small. another thing i cant stand about this scale is that it is not sensitive enough to weigh things that is less than 1 gram. its supposed to be able to but i have put things that are .5 grams and it just doesnt read at all. the instructions say that if its not reading properly then it needs to be calibrated-but that means i have to go out and spend more money on a weight-defeating the purpose of buying an inexpensive scale. someone said that you were better off donating your money to charity, and i second that. i was trying to buy something inexpensive and i ended up getting something cheap.........i wonder what the sellers return policy is...."
4,scale review,didn't think to buy a scale to the hundredth (.001) but this one is very accutare and precise. good buy
2,Cheap product - probably second hand too. Not as pictured,"Product arrived poorly packaged, literally bashed, worn, looked as if it had been sitting on a store shelf for years. The actual scale does not look like the one in the picture. The buttons are black, not silver, and don't say the same thing. The scale is lightweight and cheap but it does work.The SKU label had several stickers taped over it - not sure what is going on there - but I'm guessing this was definitely second hand, maybe even third hand. Oh yeah - it took forever to arrive too. Wouldn't purchase from this seller again."
1,RIP OFF!!!,never worked correctly...COULDN't even calibrate it!! DO NOT BUY THIS HUNK OF JUNK!!!! Should have known from the 3 pages of bad reviews!!
2,NOT WORTH IT,This is not a good buy. Spend a few more dollars and get a better one with a larger weigh plate.
1,battery drainer,If you leave the batteries inside they will drain out the next time you use it. I have to take out the batteries and put them back inside every time I want to use it. I don't recommend this product. Its cheap for a reason.
1,not useful for much,This would be a great product if you are only planning on weighing very small items that fit on the very small scale platform but not uselful for weighing anything larger than that. It works just fine just keep in mind that it is small and because the platform is level with the digital read out it is impossible to use for anything bigger than about 2x2 inches. The description should clarify this fact.
1,Micro pocket scale,"It is totally inaurate, does not work correctly, is very small and unusable. It is not as described in the details to order. I wanted a small (thin) scale with a large weigh surface. This is not as described. I have never used it because of the gross inaccuracy. It will not weigh coins as it states."
3,Good...,"I find it very helpful for what i use it for. I mostly measure my fresh herbs, and it works pretty good, easy to use. But, if you work too slowly it shuts off, which can be a pain, but all in all, i like it."
3,TINY TINY!,"This scale is only 2.5 x 3 inches large. When you put anything bigger than that on it, you cannot see the numbers.(The weight platform is only 2.25 inches square.)Just so you know!"
5,Great product!!!,"This scale is great! When it says Pocket Scale, they aren't kidding. It is as long as my razr cell phone. I use it to weigh those little beads called seed beads and it works great."
3,"good price, a few problems","I purchased this scale to weigh chemicals for amature rocketry. The biggest problem that I have run into is that the power save feature turns off the scale while I am still adding chemicals to the weight dish. When you turn the scale back on, it zeros itself out. It slows me down alot. Other than that, it has worked fine so far. For the price, I'd say it's a good deal."
2,Useless as received,"The little scale turned on with no problems, but I quickly realized that it was giving results that were very inaccurate. It would measure 10-15% less than a calibrated scale. No problem, I thought, as the instructions said it just needed a quick calibration. The problem, the ONLY way to calibrate it is with a 500g weight. My calibration weight kit does not contain this, and to purchase this weight is 2 to 3 times more than the cost of the scale. Defeats the purpose of an economical, small scale. I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt by giving it 2 stars, with the assumption that it may be accurate if it came calibrated. I'm off to buy a different scale now.."
4,WOW!!,"For a small inexpensive scale this one works great. It is very sensitive and does a great job for a pocket sized scale. Be carefull to make sure you have the weighing tray centered on the weight sensor though, with it's high level of sensitivity it is easy to get a false reading if you do not have the tray in the right position."
5,Good price for scale.. does what I need it to.,"Great little scale that I can put in my bag and go with. It uses regular batteries so no need to add it to the piles of other small electronics I no longer use because I need a specific type of battery. Even though I did not purchase a calibration device to go with it, I just used a penny to calibrate it and everything worked fine. Just remember that when using the lid for a tray to adjust accordingly on scale. For less than ten dollars, I have a scale that I that works just as well as other models. It was cheaper than most models of its type at my local brick and mortar store and even some other online retailers."
5,Very Tiny,This scale is very tiny and could fit in your pocket if you wanted it to. It seems accurate and is very easy to use. I like that it was so inexpensive too
4,Nice... Not as pictured tho!,Just received the scale today in the mail... Came fast and was pleased. It is a little different than the one that is pictured. This one has black buttons but seems to work just fine. I need to pick up a 200 gram calibration weight just to make sure the scale is accurate but over all it seems to be on perfect working order!!
3,Tiny pocket size is more correct.,You can't weigh a hair but you can weigh small items and small amounts of adhesives and such if you are doing a project that requires such.
1,Doesnt Calibrate,"The product arrived at my house within two days. The packaging was undamaged and the scale arrived in great condition. Unfortunately, this is a cheap scale. I cant even get it to calibrate itself. It is useless. Don't buy."
4,A great little scale for the price,"I love this little thing. I bought it because I was tired of trying to measure serving sizes of solid foods in a measuring cup, and so far it has lifted this burden. My only complaint is that it is so small, but for the price you can't really expect much more.Also, many people seemed to have a problem with the device not being calibrated. To test, make sure it's set on the grams (there are three units of measurement to choose from), and place a nickel on the scale. It should read five grams. Hopefully this will save some people from having to buy a 500g calibration weight."
4,A good scale.,"This is a good little scale for an even better price. The only qualm I have with the item is that it can only be calibrated by a 500g weight, but I managed to get it with .7 g accuracy on 5 oz by calibrating with 1 liter of tap water. All in all it's a good scale, and is worth the money for sure. I wound up selling the one I bought for $30 so I'll be buying a new one soon, probably the same one again."
5,Exremely accurate and a great deal!,"Just received this nice looking scale. It is extremely accurate out of the box. Tested it immediately. Great deal... bought this scale plus received the Cuisaid ProDigital AccuWeigh Digital Kitchen Scale (combined list of $82) for $9.99 (total for both). Both scales are spot on! Can't see anybody passing this offer up. Using one in the kitchen, and the other for postage, etc."
3,Good looking but who designed for?,"This watch is a looker. I bought the LB42BL a while ago and it is really nice to look at. But the watch has one major downside - it is very hard to resell, so if you are looking for something that holds its value you might want to move on - and more importantly if you want to wear the watch, you need to have big wrists to wear it comfortably. Look at the picture, the steal part to the top and bottom of the case extend pretty far outward, which means you need to have a wrist with a pretty substantial diameter. For a $500 watch I would have expected more care in designing it."
2,HAHAHAHAHA!,"I remember watching these guys on cartoon when I was a little kid back in the eighties, but DANCE MIXES! C'mon! What will people think of next!"
4,Cilescu finds her sapphic style,"Mistress Mine is a good read if you like the genre. Sophia, the heroine, is a ""classical"" submissive. Her beauty and meek personality brings her under the spell of a variety of mistresses, who take on the task of training her to be the perfect love slave.My favorite theme and setting. Written in Cilescus caracteristic ""older"" style language, it proceeds nicely through a not VERY sophisticated plot, as Sophia sits behind bars and tell her mysterious lady visitor the story of her life.Her experiences are very harsh, and in fact at times a little too cruel to match the erotic tension built throughout the story, especially the last part. And then I refer more to the mental than the physical ordeals.But - even if it's still got potential - I consider it a great lesbian D/s story. May I recommend Cilescus tree books ""A Mistress and a Maid"", which keep up the good work....."
5,Much Better than the Original LP,"I too, concur with the first reviewer. I was thrilled to find this amazing recording on CD. I had the original on a 33-1/3LP which I purchased in the late 50's. I too have listened to many recording and performancs of the majestic 4th. I have never heard a better performance. The sounde is full and rich, the tempi, spot on!"
5,This is the Best,"Music just does not get any better than this. All the music in this box set is absolutely superb. I love Mozart and I especially love his chamber music. This along with his Quintets, Quartets for Strings and Wind are my favorites. This box set should be part of every Mozart lovers collection."
5,A Mozart must have.,"I love these pieces, and they are played brilliantly on this recording. Grumiaux's tone is absolutely wonderful. The sound of this recording is excellent. I would highly recommend this to any Mozart fan, or any fan of chamber. \m/"
5,great show,"i forgot about the quality of this show-until i watched it now,yrs later-pure entertainment--rob g was perfect in the role--his dry humor reminded me of bob newharts comedy style-a must have for those who want the good old days of quality tv rather than the garbage on tv today"
5,Classic T.V. Rocks!!!,"I love Benson. I have cable television as most people do. But I find that many of the shows don't have alot of substance in it. I love shows like Benson that keeps things ""Real"". The actors are great. The only thing about this set is that it just don't show enough. It' sort of like the phrase about Lays Potato Chips - I bet you can't eat just one. Well with Benson - I bet you can't just watch one episode and be done. NO WAY!! - I love it!! - Amazon thanks again for carrying great products with some of the best prices."
4,Great Comedy!,"This was and Is a great show! one of mine and my mom's favorites. I watched this show when I was a kid in the late 80's. Thsi is the first time I have seen the first season and its great so far. What makes this a cool set is the interviews, a must own for a classic Tv fan!!"
5,This one is WELL worth it!,"Sony did a wonderful job with this DVD. For us fans of the show, we've been waiting a long time but the wait was worth it. All the episodes are the full, UNCUT versions! You'll see the original intro on the pilot episode when Benson arrives in a cab, gets checked by the security guard, sprinkled by the garden hose and chased by the dogs. Aside from the episodes themselves, there is a video introduction of the show by Robert Guillaume, a photo gallery, ""Favorites From the First Season"" (including commentary by Guillaume, James Noble (Gov Gatling), and Executive Producer Tony Thomas. Also included is an almost 30-minute retrospective of the show, the cast, and how the actors worked together (this also features Guillaume, Noble, and Thomas).The artwork is nice as well. Sony has gotten their share of criticism for some of their releases but I can't complain about this one. I think it's GREAT!!"
1,DONT DO IT ...,I PURCHED THIS IN JAN FOR MY BIRTHDAY I HAVENT HAD MUCH TIME TO WATCH THE MOVIES I BOUGHT WHICH WERE LIKE 16 IN TOTAL CUZ I HAVE TWO KIDS. RECENTLY GOT SICK AND DECIDED TO WATCH THIS DVD . GUESS WHAT THE DVDS STUCK TO THE CASE THEY WERE IN AND BROKE.. WOW THERE GOES MY MONEY. I DONT KNO HOW TO RETURN IT OR EVEN IF THEY WILL LET ME CUZ ITS BEEN SO LONG....
5,You'll Laugh!!!,"Benson was and still is one of the funniest sitcoms ever. It just kept getting better every episode. Don't miss the 8th episode called ""Jessica."" I've watched all three discs twice and bought a copy to send to my niece. This is Robert Guillaume at his very best. The dialogue is witty, the facial expressions great. A real laugh-out-loud treasure."
3,A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN BOOK,"THIS IS THE STORY OF A WOMAN WHO ATTEMPTS TO POISON HER HUSBAND AND IS ACQUITTED OF THE CRIME, AS THE ATTEMPT FAILS. HER HUSBAND'S TESTIMONY AIDS IN HER ACQUITTAL. THE BOOK DEALS WITH THERESE'S PUNISHMENT BY HER HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER AND HER SUFFERING THROUGHOUT THE REST OF HER LIFE AS SHE ATTEMPTS TO LIVE WITH THE VIVID MEMORY OF HER CRIME."
3,"important book for freedom of speech, but...","I picked up my copy of Shame in the New Dehli airport 3 years ago and finally got around to reading it this winter. I found myself skipping pages at a time because they were full of `statistics' and found them distracting from the story of Sudhamoy and the rest of his family. Being an outsider to Bangladeshi politics I was reading this story to familiarize myself with, what is for me, a little know nation. I was introduced to a family that I became interested in and a nation going through awful turmoil. Much of the time `Shame' read as a political treatise. I would have found the book more engaging if I had taken a course in South Asian politics. Because of her persecution, Nasrin has been comparied to Salman Rushdie, but I would not put her in the same category of writer. Overall I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in South Asia."
2,The author does not seem to know how to tell a story,"Whatever this book may be as a sociopolitical statement, it makes a remarkably poor novel. I basically skimmed through it after 50 pages or so. All the characters talked like newspapers. The story should have been suspenseful, especially after Maya's abduction, but I couldn't bring myself to care about either the fate of the Dutta family or the Hindu/Muslim problem at large. Frankly, I was bored stiff by this book. Maybe I am just not the right audience."
1,Teslima Nasreen has no idea what she's talking about...,I don't know why Teslima Nasrin has a totally different point of view about everything she writes. I think it's a 'shame' that we have such a hypocrite writer in our country.
2,Terrible vendor!,"I strongly recommend everyone avoid Grady's Hardware as a vendor. I tried multiple times via email and phone messages to arrange for a return, since these bows would not work on our house. I was COMPLETELY snubbed and ignored. Unless you're positive that there is 0% chance you will need to return anything you order from Grady's Hardware, I stronly recommend you avoid them because of their horrible business practices."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I'm not sure if the listing changed or I missed NOT LEXMARK product. But it isn't. I thought remanufactured meant LEXMARK but just a returned or previously defective product. Anyway, does'nt look like lexmark and doesn't perform like lexmark. My color cartridge has been ok, but the black one showed signs of leaking when it got here and does not print consistently. Always light areas of black on the edges of the paper. I would spend a few more dollars next time and buy the real thing."
5,refreshingly energetic,"Prolapse has the stuff... The sugarcubes had it, and the Pixies had it. Now it's Prolapse in the spotlight of inovation, moving male and female vocals, juxtaposed lyrics, and contrasting emotions. Keep your ears and mind open and Prolapse will bless you. You may not realize their genius at first listen, but once Prolapse's sound wins your favor you'll never want to part with this or any of their albums."
2,Real friggin hip,2 1/2Pseudo-edgy indie rock experimentation only works when this band is in strict focus of its often repetitiously vacant doodling.
5,Occasional music for all occasions,"I don't think anyone wrote better ""background music,"" as it were, than Mozart. I find myself listening to the serenades and divertimenti quite often these days. How does Sir Neville compare to other performances? He's just as good as anything else I've heard. Full recommendation."
1,Not the net that is pictured,"I purchased this net specifically because the picture shows that it has binding tape all around with top and bottom corner grommets and a smaller mesh. The net I received is nothing at all like the picture. It is burgundy netting with only a top corner grommet. It also only came with a top wide white binding and the bottom binding is thin and black. Their isn't any binding tape on the sides, nor is it squared, meaning the measurements on one end are a 2-3 inch difference from the other end. I have yet to hear back from the company as to why they sent me a different net after their initial reply ""we're looking into it"". I read other reviews and apparently this has happened often. I am very disappointed. I am wondering if anyone has actually received a net that looks like the picture? I wish I could attach a pic for other potential buyers. The net I received will suffice but it isn't what I expected that I purchased. The ol' classic bait and switch."
2,Not the item pictured,The item I received was not the item pictured. The one I received was much cheaper looking than the one in the picture.
4,Solid net,Set this up in my back yard and through a full summer of being up and used failry regularly it has peformed well.
5,Great quality,I use this as a gate across my drive way to keep my pug in the yard. Works great and has held up with heavy use and being driven over. Great product.
4,Great so far,We bought this badminton net for our 8 year old daughter's birthday. My husband made poles to go with it. It is a great looking product and we are very happy with it so far.
1,fireplace junk,Mismatched parts in the box. Grate was wrong style and size for both what was ordered and the instruction booklet. Had to talk to some foreigner in New York for return shipping - hope I get the proper refund. Poor quality control - never again.
2,"A Little Too Grandiose . . . . Where's The ""Joy"" Of The Title?","There's no denying the strengths and abilities of the people involved (Bernstein, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the NY Philharmonic), and I can't really fault the presentation either . . . . It's their whole approach to the material that I have a problem with. Now, I don't mind a little bombast in my Christmas music (the Robert Shaw Chorale's ""Festival Of Carols"" is one of my favorites, and the arrangements on that album are quite big), but in the case of ""The Joy Of Christmas"" the whole thing is so in-your-face that I want to step back from the speakers when I listen to it. This music doesn't sound very happy or festive, and is lacking in the warmth I associate with Christmastime and Christmas music. I much prefer the more chipper stuff like Percy Faith & His Orchestra or Arthur Fiedler & the Boston Pops."
1,Won't Play,"I ordered two copies of this CD, one for me and one for my daughter. It will not play on my CD player, a Technics model. We have never had anything like this happen before. My spouse took the CD to a neighbor's home and was able to play it on his player. On the strength of that, I gave my daughter her copy. I have no idea whether she has tried to play it or not. My guess is that she won't until next Christmas. She is overworked and that won't be a high priority. In case you are wondering, our CD player continues to work well, playing all our other CDs."
5,Christmas Music Done Right,"No more beautiful rendition of the Christmas songs presented on this recording exist, from the rousing trumpet flourishes of O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL, the exotic treatment of PATAPAN, the obscure but lovely LULLAY MY LIKING, ONCE IN ROYAL DAVID'S CITY, and SILENT NIGHT the way it is supposed to be done. Quiet and reverent, not bellowing out like the eruption of Mt. St. Helen's. A beautiful cd. A must for any collection."
5,Just As I Remembered,"Raise the roof and sing praises on high! Play this if you cannot make it to church, and you will feel like you are there. The incomparable sound of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir with all the religious classics. A few oddities are tagged on at the end, the Nutcracker, Children's Prayer from Hansel & Gretel and the ubiquitous Handel's Messiah."
4,Buying single tracks? Watch out!,"I agree that this Album is all the other reviewers say it is. It's wonderful! However, there is a lineup problem on The Nutcracker numbers: #17 is actually the Overture; #18 is the Marche; #19 is the Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy; #20 is the Russian Dance; #21 is the Arab Dance; #22 is the Chinese Dance & #23 is the Dance of the Mirlitons. If you are buying just one of these, be sure to listen to it first. You wouldn't want to buy the wrong one! Happy Holidays!"
5,Carmina Burana,I was a big fan of Ozawa when he conducted the Boston Philharmonic.Having been a student at the New England Conservatory of Music I regularily attended his concerts there and at Tanglewood.I have heard his performances of this piece with two other symphonies but none have had the dynamic range or power of the Berlin set.I strongly recommend this recording for superior quality of sound and especially if you already like the exuberance and aggressive conducting style in the Karajan/Berstein tradition!
4,"Good, But Not Excellent","The principal fault with this one is that Ozawa seems to fall into the trap of believing that fast equals better in romantic-style music. Parts of the piece are well-done, and the final two tracks played together are very enjoyable even for this recent convert to classical music, but far too often he seems to rap the sound out at too rapid a clip, overpowering the intrinsic quality of the music with his desire to impress through speed. (I apologize if my review is too general for a classical-music audience, but as I say I'm a recent convert, and perhaps my review will do some good for someone as wet behind the ears as I am.)"
3,Not Good Enough!,"Even though the voices are indeed worth the music, the tempo given to the music is a little too fast. Ozawa does not stress the proper notes nor does he give the exact time for each to take its own importance. Instead he hauls one over the other, it's like he cuts the breath out of certain notes. If you want to hear a good Carmina Burana interpretation you should hear the one conducted by Antal Dorati with the Royal Philarminic Orchestra, the Brighton Festival Choir, Norma Burrowes, Louis Devos, and John Shirley-Quirk. This was recorded in 1976 in London, UK."
5,Brilliant,"This was my first recording of Carmina Burana and it ranks as one of the finest. Ozawa, with the BPO, soloists and chorus make this a memorable recording all round! Try and watch the DVD version recorded a year later with different soloists, but the same orchestra and chorus"
2,"I Must Concur - Speeds, overall are too fast!!!!!","Ozawa's 1969 RCA-BMG Boston Symphony Performance ( made four years prior to his appointment as BSO music director ), is FAR preferable. To take it one step further, in my opinion, his earlier '69 BSO version IS THE ""Carmina"" to get!!!"
1,Don't buy it,"I am sorry but I cannot reccomend this recording, even if Hampson and Gruberova are in it. Whose idea was it to put so much difference in the level of sound between the soft and the loud parts? If you set your system to the soft parts something will break when the loud parts show up. Be careful and don't buy this disc."
4,Its the worst of his new album and its still 3.5-4 stars,"This song definitely the worst song on the album and it still receives 3.5-4 stars.The remainder of his album is absolutely amazing.""Incense & Candles"" is his best song in 20 years. It ranks up there with Purple rain.""Black Sweat"" is also some of his best work.His latest protégé ""Tamar"" is featured on the ""Black Sweat"" video. I saw her in concert with Prince and had FRONT ROW tickets. For most of the concert I forgot that Prince was even there. ""Prince filled the seats, while Tamar and the Twins stole the show!""Not that Prince's music of the last 3 years have been bad, its actually been quite good if you like jazz. Yet 3121 is more commercial. It has some sexual overtones and is very refined.If you like old school prince, then you will love this Album. Just don't judge it based on ""Te Amo Corazon."""
4,Solid,"""Does anyone else remember when the release of a new Prince single was exciting?""I do remember a time when music fans wasn't such whiners.This is abit of a odd song that's completely different from everything off of his last album.It takes a couple of listens to get into it... More so if you're an older fan... But actually give it a chance."
3,SAD BUT IT IS PRINCE,"I HAVE BEEN A PRINCE FAN SINCE 1977. THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE WORST CUTS FROM HIM TO DATE. PRINCE HAS FALLEN OFF THE DEEP END, DROWNING IN HIS OWN EGO.IT HAS GOTTEN TO THE POINT OF LOSING HIS CREATIVE SIDE, THE CREATIVITY WHICH MADE HIM A HOUSE HOLD NAME.I KNOW WITH TIME COMES CHANGE, BUT THE CHANGES HE HAS MADE HAS MADE HIM MUTE TO THE STYLE AND SOUND WHICH SHROUDED THE MASSES IN PURPLE AND SOMETIMES PEACH; THE SOUND THAT THE MUSIC INDUSTRY LONGS FOR AND WHAT THE WORLD IS WAITING FOR. TO TRUE PRINCE FANS, THIS SONG SOUNDZ LIKE SOMETHING FROM HIS UNDER THE CHERRY MOON DAYS. IN OTHER WORDS HE IS REPEATING HIMSELF. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS SONG 1 STAR BUT HEY IT IS PRINCE. HOPE THE ALBUM IS BETTER."
1,Nu Power Valium,"This is tripe. It sounds like a third rate Julio Iglesias impersonator trying to write a Sade pastiche in the manner of Prince, except that that at least would be funny to listen to - even for ten seconds. This isn't. It's painful. And boring. And leaden. And so utterly, utterly predictable. To call it elevator muzak would be disparaging to James Last.Consider the sort of lead-off singles Prince has released in the past: Sign O The Times, When Doves Cry, 1999, Kiss, Alphabet Street. Then consider Prince's greatest ballads: Sometimes It Snows In April, The One, The Most Beautiful Girl In The World, Wasted Kisses, Crucial, Adore etc, etc. Now, potential buyers, ask yourselves this - can this really be the work of the same person? Answer: yes. Should you buy it? Go figure ..."
5,Intricate Subtlety,"It is almost two years since Prince released Musicology - his last ""proper"" album. Now the time has come for 3121, which is planned for release early next year. Te Amo Corazon heralds the coming of the latest installment of Prince's genius. Covered with lush strings, mellow, Latin-inspired drum work, bizarre guitar licks, and touching piano chords, Te Amo Corazon unveils as one of the most focused, accessible, easy-listening, but nonetheless complex and deep songs Prince has ever written. The song oozes atmosphere of love and passion and makes you wonder what it takes for the artist inspiration-wise to come up with such a gem."
3,Can you see the forest for the trees,"Like many documentaries, the people and places are dressed up as to not offend that peoples culture. Due to hunger and oppression some people still choose slavery as a way out."
1,Worst Bio book EVER!!!,"This is the worst bio book I have ever read. There are not enough diagrams, and the author focuses too much on the history of discoveries as opposed to the actual discoveries. I wanted to rank this book a 0/5 but that was not an option. The book was so horrible that a majority of the time, I could not read it...I thought it was extremely dull and dry...And I normally love biology!!! My professor wanted us to use the Reece Biology book, but the department would not approve it, so we got stuck with this cr@p. If you're looking for a good biology textbook, this book is not for you. Compared to the Reece book, the Freeman book makes you feel like you are reading each definition on each page in the dictionary and are being forced to memorize it. I had the opportunity to read a chapter or two of the Reece book, and I can tell you that it is 1000X more interesting and readable than this Freeman book."
3,"3.5 Stars... Warming up for ""Congregation""","The Afghan Whigs issued their second album ""Up In It"" in 1990 and while quite good, in retrospect the album sounds like an appetizer for the truly great next album, 1991's ""Congregation"".""Up In It"" (13 tracks, 45 min.) starts with a blast, ""Retarted"", as sure an arena rocker as you'll find. The album generally sounds quite heavy, with guitars all over, check out ""Hated"" for example. ""You My Flower"" is a nice breather in all the heaviness. Other good tunes include ""Big Top Halloween"" and the closer ""I Am the Sticks"". Overall, the album drags a bit, and a tighter song selection would have served the album well.This is a good Whigs album, but not the best. For that, check out ""Congregation"" and ""Gentlemen"". Finally, I cannot write this review without mentioning that the Afghan Whigs are one of the very best bands coming out of Cincinnati in the last 15 years (along with Over the Rhine)... Greg Dulli, come on back, all is forgiven!"
2,"Pass, Unless You Want All Their Albums","This is really a rough around the edges release. It sounds like a garage band that I had play in a small bar I owned and not the polished, smooth, funky sound of The Afghan Whigs I was looking for. You have to start somewhere right? This seems to be close to their origins and not at all like the band would be in a few more years. Hint, there's more screaming in this CD than all the rest of their stuff later combined!"
5,Beast live subpop band,"2nd best show of my 80s 90s show going years, 2nd to Jane's Addiction SoundGarden Love Rockets at the Paramount.The Whig's opened up with the theme from Jesus Christ Superstar, counting the Lashings.Was quite moved. 04.20.1992Small crowd."
1,"What's below a ""B"" Flick Rating""","I'm not sure what Kirk was thinking when he did this movie... Acting was poor, directing was poor, locations were poor, lighting was poor, =.... instead of going on... I can't think of anything I liked. I forced myself to watch till the end only to be sorely disapointed in the time will NEVER get back."
1,one kirk should forget,I love kirk but this has to be one of the bad ones in his library of movies poorly made and not interesting at all .
1,Vague,This movie was quite lame. Sorry to be so vague but the plot was poor...the producer must have been working a double-shift at the nearby seven-eleven and then working on the film at night. Not gripping at all.
1,This band SUCKS,"If you like indiferent out of tune guitar playing and drumming that makes Mo Tucker seem like a virtuoso then this album is for you. The singing and song writing are occasionally interesting but the general atmosphere of boredom and sloppy indifference ruins the experience for me. This sounds as if several of my musically less than talented friends decided to form a band and a week later recorded an album. It's not charming, just weak and one more reason to hate indie pop."
3,Group groping,"A decent story that varies between steamy and lurid, it's a fun read for the open minded reader of lustful longings and group groping."
1,A Princess for Christmas,The acting was poor and no storyline to keep me interested. I'm sorry to say I got bored very quickly.
1,Disappointed,"I am an avid Christmas movie fan and this one is a reject. I liked the story line but the choice of actors was all wrong. There was no chemistry between the couple and poor acting on all accounts, just all wrong. I would not watch movies with these actors again."
3,A Princess for Christmas,It arrived quickly and in good shape. It was a fair movie...not one of my favorites. I would not buy it again.
2,"Entertaining, but","Usually I am very tolerant of Christmas movies, not sure I can write anything positive about this movie though. Perhaps this movie was made for a young audience - the story was very predictable and the acting, well, just sad."
2,Terrible movie,"The story is boring. I guessed the end in minute 5. The girl needs acting lessons, even her hair seemed fake. I bought it to see Roger More, but the rest was a disapointment. Don't spend money on this movie, it is not worth it."
4,Great Movie,I love thios movis when come to Hallmark Channel last year I knew I had to get it when it came on dvd
4,A Delightful Film,"This was an enjoyable film and a nice addition to my Christmas Collection. There were a couple of scenes the director should have changed or cut, as Im not a big fan of Rap music.The only other problem I had was with the wardrobe... when the Princess was to make her grand entrance, and she was on the top of the stairs with all eye on her.... she should have made your heart flutter a bit. The dress she wore was not a bit flattering, and was like a pail of cold water."
5,love love love,love this movie so much....I can't believe how great it is....I had to buy 2 copies one for us one for our daughter
4,A true Cinderella story,"The transplanting of an American commoner and her sister's children into the world of the British aristocracy to visit their Grandfather for Christmas is a humorous, heat warming, and delightful piece of work that you will watch over and over again. I know that I did."
5,Funny yet heartwarming!,"A skillfully crafted blending of the aristocracy of England with the average life in America. Funny, heartwarming, wonderful blending of the two!!"
5,Wonderful movie.,"A Princess for Christmas is an excellent family movie. I always enjoy ""Cinderella"" type stories. This was similar and we very much enjoyed it."
5,Fun,"I'm not sure that this was worth the full price paid, but I did enjoy it. It's a bit of a chick flick. Suitable for the entire family."
5,Mircales can happen,"This is another great movie, every girls dream do come true in movies don't pass this one up..Get it enjoy"
3,Bought as a gift,"I got this for my friend Rob, he is obsessed with the music of Wednesday 13 and this is not sold in stores anywhere even remotely close to me. He was happy with it but wishes it were longer or had several episodes.I watched it with him and I guess I will stick with his music (except Gunfire 76 that s**t's weak)"
3,well...,"Ok - I, as well as many other W.13 fans out there, heard of this WeirdO A Go-Go dvd. I have been a fan of his music for quite some time, so I figured if he can make some killer music, especially his 90210 album, then the dvd must kick some as well. Well...I was kind of on the right track. The dvd is ok...I think the special features are moreless a waste of time than anything...nothing too exciting in there...but the dvd itself wasnt too bad...maybe you need to have drunk vision goggles to watch this for it to be a bit more hilarious...i mean, yeah, some parts are funny, but the whole hting overall..it just didnt cut it...I think wednesday should have made a b-rated half an hour horror film instead...it may have turned out better...but anyways, if you're a W.13 fan who wants everything by him, then you probably already bought it...but its not as good as it seems...well, in my view anyways."
4,A seahorse with wings!,Weirdo a Go-GoI got it not really knowing what to expect but knowing it had to be good it was by Wednesday 13. So I threw it in to watch it and It was amazing you have a to have a weird sorta sense of humor and if you do you are going to love this DVD its short I would have mabye liked it longer but it is well worth it. The bloopers and other extras are Awsome!
5,Go Video portable dvd player,I dont trust unknown brands but I got this from someone and it was surprisingly good. The sound is loud the picture is really clear and the battery life is really long. In my opinion its a great buy for the price.
1,IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME,"This brush looked the same but not made of the hard bristle it used to be made of. This rush leaving off the ""b"" for brush is not the same. It wimps out once water touches it. I have excellent skin and tone from using the brush previous brushes.This is not made of that same material, and I am sure the manufacturer already knows this . Go back to what worked for me please"
5,great pillow for new babies,This pillow is great. It is larger than bobby pillows and it comes with a washable removable cover. Ideal for breastfeed babies and bottle feed babies.
3,D-back shirt,"Great shirt--received it fast. Unfortunately it shrunk--a lot! Can still wear it, but it is quite fitted now."
5,fan,"I am an avid reader and this was a good book, i read it in 1 day and am becoming a huge fan of her stories."
4,Slow Starter but Excellent Book,"I have read the other reviews on this book and I so totally disagree. Yes it was a slow starter but once you got into the story it was a page turner. I read until 3am getting finished. Yes, it has a bunch of characters but if you know anything about Lisa Jackson you'll realize they may not seem important now but they will turn up in another book.I loved the whole story, the way Shannon felt ill at ease with her family, there was a reason. How her adopted daughter fit in the picture, how she was so like her mother, not mentioned you just knew it by her actions. And the love affair between Shannon and Travis, so fitting. Brought together by the love for their daughter. I enjoyed it thoroughly. And I look forward to seeing Nate Santana in an upcoming book!!"
3,interesting,"This is my first Lisa Jackson book. I read this book in two days. It was entertaining. It kept me interested wanting to find out ""who done it"". Some things were confusing to me, and I found myself saying HU? alot. I cant mention them or it would ruin the ending.. I think the charector development could have been richer. I didnt feel emotionally conected to the main charectors. The teenager, Dani, I did feel a connection to. I thought her scenes were realistic and the inner dialog was good, I was rooting for her and cheering her on. I gave it three stars because I have read way worse. The twists and the intrigue was good, not great but good, as I said it left me with some unresolved questions. I am going to try another book by this same author that had a better rating. The potential is there for something great."
2,Not enough character in the Characters,"I read this book in two days, not because I was loving the book, but with objectve being to finish it. There were characters introduced into the book that weren't even need, point in case,the elusive Santana.Edit out about 200 pages and you may very well have a good book. The character development was poor and information, pertinent to the story or not, often came from left field.This was my first book from Lisa Jackson and definitely my last."
3,"Good, but not the best","I have read a few other Lisa Jackson books and this one was not the best. Although it kept me turning the pages, there were a lot of characters in this book. On occassion, I had to turn back a few chapters to remember who they were. Not one of her best, but still a good read."
4,Tips for successful dining,"I bought this book to strengthen my grilling techniques. I made a mistake because that is not the focus of this book. There is an extended discussion of grades and what cuts come from various part of the animal and how to get what you need from the butcher. The book is further divided between beef, veal, lamb, and pork recipes.To my pleasure I found the authors' top 5 tips for cooking meat and the recipes in the tender beef section. These would make the purchase of the book worth while. I did not spend much time with the other section and so express no opinion on them."
3,"Does it compare with ""Pickles""?","As long as I had anticipated Schlesinger's ""Meat,"" I was not terribly pleased with it's content. First, it hardly matched the bold, ribald language and exciting conjecture that is ""Pickles."" But one can hardly imagine topping pickles. I mean, come on, there pickles! Phat Al speaks wisely of the numerous recipes Schlesinger offers to cook meat. His erudite scholarship of the bovine is nothing short of spectacular. However...it's just not ""Pickles."" But again, what is pickles. Bravo Schlesinger, you sing the song of six pence, but could only afford three. Hooray for meat."
5,Excellent,"This book provides a wealth of practical, well organized information. I have tried the author's ""Real Deal"" beef stock with great results. I look forward to trying other variations of that recipe. This book has definitely boosted my culinary confidence level and I look forward to trying more recipes in the near future."
3,Just what I needed,This book was sixty dollars less than my bookstore's price and was in good condition. I was glad to get it without any marks or damages to the book. Great shipping materials and process.
3,Dad,"This was a very good buy, Book showed up on time and saved me money. This was perfect for my daughter"
5,"thanx a zillion,i got it right on time","sori i reviewed this very late,but thanx for gettin the book to me on time n ingreat shape."
1,Interestign articles with a thick political spin,"This revision must have been specially produced just to include all the anti-Bush rhetoric. In nearly every chapter, responsibility for the current state of the environment is laid squarly on President Bush's administration.In addition, there are no references given for any of the information presented in the book. As a student, we are expected to take this author's word for it that everything he has presented is true and accurate, and that he is simply a repository for all of this accurate information. In fact, the lack of references is absolutely striking when you consider this is a textbook that is supposedly presenting facts. The only references given are those for photo credits.Unfit as a college textbook."
1,Workbook - Environmental Science,It is a workbook and not what I was attempting to order. I expected a reading/learning media. This is only for use in classroom setting.
4,One of the Best,"This is one of the most readable environmental texts I've seen.It is very comprehnsive and the coverage of the newest scientific results in the science of resource conservation is simply excellent. The content is oriented around a group of themes and applied to the concept of ecosystems and their management. Is almost as if the author has takrn the first halting steps toward a unified environmental theory.Two negative points though. Coverage of forest resources is a little thin, and like most textbooks, the price is way too high."
5,Great Book,"I needed this book for a science class. Interesting reading material. I learned a lot about the environment, and how we contribute to it."
4,Ok text for those new to the subject,"I used this text for my college students in Environmental Science. We actually took some chapters from this book, some from another, and combined them. I found the book ok, with relatively good comprehension from my students. That is saying a lot, considering they were first years, many with English as a second language.If you want a good E.S. textbook for what should now be a bargain price, this isn't bad.However, I have gone in search a new, more cutting edge, up to date text for future semesters (haven't found what I'm looking for yet). I find what most such texts are weak on are providing clear, tangible ideas and discussions the students can relate to in order to be good environmental stewards with good relevant critical thinking skills, whether in their personal or professional lives.The other text we took Chapters from was ""Environment"" by Withgott and Brennan, which is also pretty good."
4,good value,This book was in great condition . I purchased it as a text book for my daughter and saved a bundle instead of purchasing it new. The condition was better than expected. The pages were like new with just a couple of frayed spots on the edge of the hard cover.
4,Lots of information,"The book is packed with good information on our global environment. It's easy on the eyes, which made it easier for me to read. My book was in black and white. Some of my classmates have books with colored pictures.It's a good book that gives a lot to think about. I would recommend the book to anyone who wants a better understanding of how our planet works environmentally, giving an appreciation for the world in which we live in."
5,Belltowerbooks to be commended,"I was 100% satisfied with my purchase. I thought the price was reasonable, and so was the delivery. The book was in great shape! I would definitely buy another book from Belltowerbooks."
3,"Not the book I needed, still waiting for a refund","I thought that this was the book I need for an online class but sadly it wasn't. Contacted the seller and the customer service was fast, efficient and polite. I returned the book, but have not yet received my refund. I am not anticipating any issues, since their customer service has been stellar from the start."
4,Great Introduction into Environmental Science,The only criticism I have of this book is there is too much interesting information. Its difficult to figure out what your professor wants you to study when there is so much information. Great read though and gives for good explanations of the material it focuses on.
2,fine but not splendid,"Mozart's generally underappreciated sonatas are here performed by Uchida. She does a credible job but having heard some of the other famous versions of this, I'm just not convinced that her version is an overwhelming achievement. There's something about Uchida's playing, though I can't quite put a finger on it, that fails to inspire. Technically she is brilliant but it often seems that she's playing on paper-thin slivers of delicate china.As for the Penguin Guides, yes, Uchida is given a rosette for this playing, but as it takes just one of the Guide writers to award a rosette, it doesn't mean unanimity."
1,"I ordered two CDs of Guadalupe Pineda Arias de Opera, instead I received ONE CD of Tania Libertad Arias de Opera.","On November 6, 2010, I ordered thru Amazon two CDs of Guadalupe Pineda Arias de Opera each for$19.84, sold by Dispatches_From_Texas_USA. It really upsets me that I was not sent the two CD's from Guadalupe Pineda Opera Arias, which is what I paid for, and not only did I get the wrong CD but I was charged for two and was only sent one CD by Dispatches_From_Texas_USA. I want to send back the wrong CD of Tania Libertad Arias de Opera (which is still in its evelope) and want my money refunded for the two CD I was charged . This has been a very disappointing experience."
4,"Great, but overpriced","I love the Sonos system and gave it 5 stars, but the stand seems a tad overpriced at $50. It is solid / well built though."
3,Sonos Controller Recharger,Works like a champ. Very practical and complementary to the Sonos Controller. But I can't rate it 5 stars because it is way too expensive for being essentially a battery recharger for the controller.
3,Even more expensive than it appears,"Because this cradle does not include the power supply, it is even more expensive than it first appears. This is an attractive piece of plastic without power. You'll need to buy the power supply to keep your controller charged while it rests in the cradle.Here is the power supply:Sonos AC100 Charging Adapter for Sonos CR100 ControllerUnfortunately, there aren't any aftermarket alternatives, so the price gouging continues.Sean P. Logue, 2008"
1,great paper weight - poor sonos charger,"If you're buying this as a secondary cradle (and I'm not sure why else you would buy this) its totally non-functional because you also need an AC Adapter.Yes, I know its shown in the picture. However if you read the description carefully it mentions that its not included."
5,The most wonderful book I have ever read,"This was the first trilogy I read from L.J Smith and thats when I felt in love with her books. I also felt in love with Damon. Of all her other bad boys Like Gabriel in Dark visions or Julian in The Forbidden Game, Damon is my favorite. I know he was supposed to be this bitter, dark and dangerous creature but I found him fascinating. He really wasn't evil sure he was a bad boy but he wasn't evil and deep in his heart he love his brother and he did love Elena. I love this book so much. This was also the only book that made conflict over which guy the girl should stay with. I really like Stefan too and I loved Damon and they both love her and they were both so right for her. She also love both men. Althought toward the end I think she made the right decision to stay with Stefan but Damon is someone I will never forget even if he is not real. I do wish he was."
3,The Bad Reunion,I love L.J. smith books but this book was the worst in the series.It really didnt fit in well w/the rest of the books. The ending is okay and suprising and thats the only good thing about this book. The whole Vampire Diarys Series is great. But out of all of the four books i liked this the least it Damon and stephen are hott as ever and theres alot of suspense so its an okay book if u like or have read any l.j. smith book i think u would or might like this one
1,NO KINDLE version???,"With the current popularity of The Vampire Diaries TV Show, it makes NO sense that this isn't available in a Kindle version. Come on publishers, get on that!"
2,No comparison to the first three.,"Unless you're the kind of person who cannot stand to read a book without a happy ending...don't bother. The resurection of Elena is contrived...and it seems like it's just an effort to capitalize on the (well deserved) success of the first three novels. and um, it's a trilogy. why are there four books? It doesn't always make sense, and is pretty pointless. Don't beat a dead horse...this book proves it, even if they don't stay dead, it's just not a good idea."
3,Should've left well enough alone,"The previous three books were wonderful. I think I read all three of them in a single day. Then there was this one... Granted, if the author had left this book off, and stayed with the origional trilogy, the story would've ended on a bittersweet note. Two feuding brothers reuinited by the sacrifice of their love. Dark Reunion delves into areas not previously explored by the other three books. It takes the series to a totally different frame, dives over a cliff, and lads WAY out in left field. Reading this book after reading the other three is sort of like getting really close to a lovely bed of roses to sniff the perfume, and suddenly coming across a pile of somthing foul."
1,Where is #4 Dark Reunion on Kindle ???,"Where is book number 4, Dark Reunion, Vampire Diaries series on Kindle ebook ??? Why put all but this one on ebook ? Come on Kindle, plz get it done..."
1,Kindle version???,This awesome series doesn't have a kindle edition? Really?...bought it at BN and downloaded the nook app on my iPad. What a let down Amazon. Get it together.
3,---,"I was annoyed that for the first time, Smith was recapping the previous books, but it didn't just take place in the beginning. No, throughout the book she kept summarizing past events which was really distracting from the actual present. Why would anyone read the fourth book before reading the first three? It just seems silly to include the constant recaps.Otherwise, this one was better than all the others. It was actually a bit exciting and I did want to know what was going to happen next unlike with the other three. The details were satisfactory enough so that I could effectively picture what was happening. I can tell that Smith improved her writing by a lot since the first book.However, the ending wasn't what I had hoped for. As soon as I read those words, I really didn't care about the last few pages. It was too unreal, and much too happy-go-lucky. That was the largest disappointment with this fourth book."
1,Rip Off,"So why is this book only available in the audible format? The kindle downloads are expensive enough so no way in hell am I paying $16 for an audible download when I'm fully capable of reading this book. Library it is, thanks Amazon!"
1,no ebook for Kindle? there's one for the Nook!,I have been reading the vampire diaries series. I don't understand why there isn't this book in a Kindle Ebook version. I want to continue reading this series in order but I can't because there isn't a version!!!!!!! Why have all the other books in this series in Kindle Ebook version and not this one???? I am very unhappy and disappointed!!!!Nook? wow....
2,Disappointed,I haven't read this book yet but I am very disappointed that this book isn't available for the kindle through eBooks. I was really looking forward to reading it but now I have to go through the tedious work of either finding it at my local library or buying it at an actually book store. I'm very disappointed..
2,Lacking,I enjoyed the first three books but I thought that this one was a bit lame. The two things that annoyed me the most:In book 3 Katherine said that she killed Klaus and now in book 4 he is alive. Was this a mistake? Was there meant to be a portion of the story explaining how Katherine thought Klaus was dead but he really wasn't? Confused.How did Elena come back from the dead?? I though it seemed a bit lazy to bring her back with no explaination of how it happened.
3,Review From One Book At A Time,"I almost wish the series would have stopped at book three. This book was nothing like the previous. With Elena gone, the story doesn't have the same pull. The characters felt forced. I think it would have worked a little better if it wasn't Elena working her magic from the dead. And then end was very cheesy. I'm not sure if I want to read the new series."
4,Just a bit confusing...WHAT WAS UP !!,"I realy loved this book but was thrown off a bit by it. So why realy is Elena Human? I don't get it. And why did Bonnie fall for Matt? Couldn't she have tried harder for Damon? Also is it just me or is Stefan a little too pathetic in this one?! So personally I think she NEEDS to write another book and answer ALL the questions. It's not that I hated the book, 'cause it was realy good But the story needs to be a little more ""Happly Ever After"" with out a football feald full of questions left after words. P.S. I'm trying to collect all her books, dose anyone know where to find them?"
5,It Was Fantastic,"I loved every minute of all of the books, but the Last one left me hangign i mean Elenas back after being dead six months what she going to do go into town and say hi everybody i'm back. What happens does stephen take elena back with him to Italy and get married or does he change her back into a vampire or what. Please write another Book Ms. Smith so we know what happens to everyone."
5,"I laughed, I cried, I loved it!","This is an awesome book, I believe the ending was right and beautiful. Although I must admit I liked L.J. Smith's version of the vampire better in the Night World series, it was just as good here, especially considering it couldn't have worked without all those little things. I always believed Elena should end up with Stefan. She showed us inside his head, and we saw how much he love Elena. But Damon, nobody knows what he was thinking, excpet the author. I think he loved Elena, but he was too far into the dark. It was beautifully written and I loved it. I read the ending about five times, just to make sure."
2,"This book was ok, not great","I don't think the Vampire Diaries were meant to be composed of 4 books, it really felt as if the 4th one was somewhat out of place. Personally, I'm not a big Elena fan and I did feel bad for Stefan but Elena was too goody-goody and spoiled, so that's basically why I wasn't too happy about this book because I was satisfied with Elena's death in the 3rd book. I don't understand how she came back; it didn't fit in. Miraculously, she comes back from the death because of some unseen god-like power. It just seems too fake. But... I think that if you have read the first 3 books, you should continue on with this one."
4,Dark Reunion!,Dark Reunion:This book is from Bonnie's POV. Anyways Bonnie starts to have these dreams with Elena in them. Elena tells her about a new enemy coming to Fells Church. So with the guidance of Elena's spirit the gang battles against their new enemy. Will they succeed?I want Damon. Ok he is hott! L.J. knows how to make these perfect bad boys. Great conclusion to the Vampire Diaries.
5,Wonderful!,I loved this book! The funny thing is... for the longest time I thought Stefan lost Elena for good. The first copy I ever got on this had the last chapter missing! Oh how I cried. Then I reread another copy and BEHOLD!- Elena LIVES! I was so thrilled!
2,I was disappointed,"Okay, at the risk of being lynched by an angry mob of LJS devotees, I just have to say that I didn't really care for this book. The first three were really good and although the ending of the third was sad, it was a perfect ending. It seemed in this book that LJS was trying to come up with a quick ending that everyone would be happy with because no one really wants the main character to die. I was pleased with the ending of the third book and I think that LJS should have left Elena in the next world where she belonged."
1,Very poor production,This is a highly fictionalized account of some of the events of the life of Katharine Hepburn. Don't take any of it for fact. Mulgrew's imitation of Hepburn is very poor as well.
5,Kate Mulgrew is wonderful as Kate Hepburn,After seeing Tea 3 times it is wonderful to listen to the audio cd. Kate Mulgrew is in my opinion the most wonderful and talented actress in the world. When you listen to the audio cd it is like you hear Katharine Hepburn. If you love Katharine Hepburn and/or Kate Mulgrew this is definitely highly recommended. Of course seeing Tea at Five in theater is the best experience ever. The audio cd is second best
5,"If you can't see the play, a MUST BUY!","I had the EXTREME fortune of seening Kate Mulgrew preform this play in Baltimore, but not before buying the CD. Kate Mulgrew had always been compared to Kate Hepburn. Her voice is amazingly like Hepburns, as her command presence. The first act of this play is amazingly funny you will laugh like crazy. if u can't see the amazing play in person this is a must buy!"
5,EXCELLENT PIECE,Kate Mulgrew is absolutely fabulous in this piece. Everything that is in the performance was backed up with at least 3 different references. This production was absolutely beautiful and transferred to CD fabulously. This is a great piece for any Mulgrew or Hepburn fan or fan of the theater!
1,Nothing copper about it.,I was disappointed in this necklace and matching earrings. I returned them. The return was very easy.
5,Hard-line masterpieces and lesser-known gems,What more could you ask for on 2 CDs! Grumiaux was a titan; I never tire of his playing.
5,Pure music,"This is a great set of cd's. The music is well written, well recorded, and well played. I highly recommend this set to all who love chamber music."
3,I was disappointed that this music is LIVE from a CONCERT.,"I love Patrick and the songs on this C.D. - they are awesome! But unfortunately the songs are live - they would have been much better if it had been recorded in a studio. (For example, one song is sung by the crowd rather than by Patrick.)"
3,Luke Hively fantastic review,"The title of my book is Eyeballs For Breakfast. The author of the book is M.M Ragz. The main character of the book is Murphy,Ashley and Peter. The problem is that Murphy likes Ashley and Ashley does not like him. Then he has to go over to her her house.I dont think Murphy is a healthy person because he is a couch potatoe. I dont think he is a respectful person either becaue he lets his dog eat his healthy eggs. He also put glue in Ashley's hair. Which is not very respectful to others.My opinion about the book is that it is an ok book. I dont know why he wrote the book. But i bet alot of people read because it was a ok book. I do give the author credit for writing the book. That is what i have to say about the book."
4,Ashley's Review,"The book is called ""Eyeballs for Breakfast."" The author is M.M. Ragz. The two main charaters of this story are Ashley and Murphy. The authors pupous is two teach us about manners and respect. This book is labled as a ficton.In this book Murpfy learns respect from other people when he gets in trouble by his by his parents.

The story shows how to properly use maners and not to put paste in peoples hair.My opinion of the book ""Eyeballs for Breakfast""is that it is a humerous book .

3,Online book review,"The title of my book is Eyeballs for Breakfast. The authour of the book is M.M. Ragz. One of the charters is Murphy, and he is a good kid.

4,Desire's Awesome Book Review,"The book is called ""Eyeballs for Breakfast"". The main characters are Murphy and Ashley and they don't like each other. The author's purpose for writing this was to entertain. The author's name is M.M. Ragz. This book is fiction, so it's not true.""Eyeballs for Breakfast"" teaches about respect and to be healthy by not eating alot of junk food. It teaches you how to be respectful and cooperative by showing you the characteristics. It also teaches about school importance and manners because they are very important.My opinions on this book was it was a very good book. It was very inspiring because it could really happen in real life so you shouldn't take that for granted. People shouldn't pick on other people because you treat people how you want to be treated. If you want respect, you've got to give respect."
1,Matt's New Review,"The name of the book I'm reviewing is ""Eyeballs for Breakfast."" This book was written by M.M. Ragz. Murphy, the main character, is your average 12-year-old in your average neighborhood. He makes Ashley Douglas, a girl in his class, angry by putting her hair in a bucket of paste. Afterwards similar events like this unfold.This book can teach you cooperation. It will also enlighten you in terms of respect. You will also learn to have proper responsibility. It will show you some ways to be helpful. If you haven't experienced them already, you'll learn some teenage difficulties.I didn't think this book was worth reading. Its just your boring old pre-teen, in your average school, in your averge community. Its easy to relate to my life, because everything in the story could possibly happen. It is a lot like my life, but that doesn't make it any more interesting. There are just simply better books out there."
3,Alie's Book Review,The title of my book is Eyeballs for Breakfast. The 2 main characters are Murphy and Ashley.The author of the book is M.M.Ragz.The setting mostly takes intheir classroom. The problem is that Murphy and Ashley can't get along.The main idea is that cooperation is important because it builds chacter. They also learned respect by showing it. Also they learned responsibilty through school work. Plus they learned to be helpful by cooperation. Another lesson is to be nice to everyone.I think this was an ecellent story.It also related to my life because I make fun of people sometimes. Murphy has some problems rhat I have too. I think this was a funny book. It also had a good moral about how to be cooperative.
3,Savannah Moser's book review,My book is Eyeballs for Breakfast the aurthers nam is M.M. Ragz.this book is about Murphy and this girl named Ashley.At the begining Murphy dipped Ashley's hair in glueand got in trouble.before his friend tried to dip her hair in glue but Murphy would not let him.What happend was Murphy dipped Ashley's hair in glue.Then Ashley moves across the street from Murphy aand she likes him but he dont know it.it doesent help that they have the same babysitter and they have to go to Ashley's house to get baby sat. Now they are not getting along at school and they are doing cooprative cones.My opinion on this bookis it is a good book.From everthing the story had in it seems pretty exciting. personally i thought the book was realy funny. The book was realy competive between Murphy and Ashley.But Ms.Fister tought them to get along.
4,Nick's Book Review,"The book is called ""Eyeballs for Breakfast"". Some of the characters are Murphy, Ashly, and Ms. Fister. The auther of the story is M.M. Ragz. It takes place outside, at school, and at Murphy's house. Murphy's problem is he does not get along with a lot of kid's in his class and at the end they do get along.The lesson they try to teach you is to cooperate with one another . They want the kid's to respect eachother by playing a game that all the school's are doing. And the game also gets them to be helpfull to one another. They teach you to be responsible by trying to get you to be healthy. They do not want you to have any teenage difficulty because Muphy has to overcome his fear of breakfast and many other things in life."
4,Amber's PICK ME!!! PICK ME!!!!!!!!,"The book I am writing about is ""Eyeballs for Breakfast"" by M.M. Ragz. The setting is Murphy's school and home. Murphy gets in trouble, and decides to not tell his parents. Later, he learns that he should have told them, and he would have gotten in less trouble. the characters in this story are Murphy and Ashley.In this book, it teaches many lessons to learn. Cooperation, like learning to work with classmates and even enemies. Respect, to eat something your parents gas cooked for you, even if it tastes awful. Being helpful, to take your own time to help someone else. Someone young could really learn from this book.I like this book, it teaches so many things. It's even humorous, but anyone could be taught or reminded of a few lessons. Somehow it relates to my life and somehow it doesn't. My life gets alittle nuts and also my dad can't cook. I would recommend this book to a friend."
3,Zach's 5 star review,"The book I read is called ""Eyeballs for Breakfast"". It's a lesson teaching story hat takes place in a neighborhood with a school. The main character is named Murphy. He is rtryiing to make friends with a fickle girl named Ashley. The author of this interesting book is M.M. Ragz.I stated that this was a lesson learning book. Murphy learns about friendship and cooperation with Ashley. They both learn to respect eachothers personalitys trhough the story. They also learn to trust eachother. Then of course Murphy gets a health lesson from his father. He is forced to eat all kinds of health food. There are may lessons learned in this book.I think that this story is interesting. I like the story for different reasons that I can't explain. It's just a well put together book. It is an intriguing book all about cooperation and other valuable lessons. ""Eyeballs for Breakfast"" is a wonderful book that is great to read to a classroom. That's how I feel about this book."

3,Brittany's review,The book is called 'Eyeballs for Breakfast'. The book was written by M.M. Ragz. The main characters are Murphy and Ashley. The author's purpose is to teach people to show respect to others.The book is fictiontype.The lessons Iearned are to show respect and improving my social skills.These things are important because they can help you get through life easier. They show these things through the mistakes of the characters. They show the mistakes by putting them in the book for a purpose. They also show the mistakes for those who don't know they are making these mistakes.The book relates to my life because my parents are srict on what I eat. The opinion I have on this book is it's an ok book. It has many lessons to be learned. Murphy learned it the hard way.
4,Eyebals for Breakfast,"The title of my book is ''Eyeballs for Breakfast.''The author of the book is M.M.Ragz.The main chacters are Pete,Iggy,Ashley,Murphy,and Mrs. Phister.I think the authos purpose is to teach us all about manners and stuff like that.Its a fictional story with real events.Thourgh the story it teachs about respect and how to be heathly like running and eating right.It also teachs coopertionby helping people and getting a reward.It alsoteachs us how to us coopertionthe right wayMy opioion about this book is its a good book.I would read it again.This book was entertaing theres not many books I can say that about.This book and my life is different in ways.Like my dad is normal and Murphys isnt."

3,"Lucas's ""Eyeballs For Breakfast"" book review","The title of the book we'e been reading is ""Eyeballs For Breakfast"". The author of this book is M.M.Ragz. This story took place in Murphy's home, town,and school.In this book a boy and girl have problems. The two kids work things out when they have to be babysitted together. The two main characters are Murphy and Ashley.In the book, Murphy learns to cooperate with kids he doesn't like. He also learned respect for his fathers horrible eggs. Murphy goes on a health program, and has to be very responsible to keep it up. He was being helpful one day by helping one boy during class make a cone. His brothers have some teenage dificulties with girls.I think this book is a really good book. It really shows a lot of manners and morals.I think everyone should rad this book. I strongly recomend anyone and everyone to read this book. Please, read this book."
2,Travis's Book Review,"The book ""Eyeballs for Breakfast""is written by M.M. Ragz.The main characters are Murphy and Ahley who can't get along.They have to get along anyways.She has to be his baby sitter.There is an odd turmoil.They have to cooperate.They have to have respect for each other.Murphy had to apologize to Ashley several times.They have the same baby sitter at the same place.She will be sure to get them to get along.My opinion on this book is that it is poorly written.There is no point to the story.Nor is there a main idea to my knowledge.That is only my opinion.You should read the book for yourself."

4,Robert's Sweet Book Review,"The book i am reviewing is called eyeballs for breakfast.It is about a boy's life in school and out of it.his name is Murphy he has a mom,dad,and two brothers.His mom is a teacher and his dad a gym teacher.He has to learn to respect others and keep out of trouble.The main idea of the story is that it shows how the life of a child is.It shows it shows the things he has to deal with in school and out.Like his mom,dad,and the rest of his family.And espeisially girls at his school.It also teaches you who not to trust and how to act around others.this story relates to me in different ways,one is that he is a student in school.I also face alought of challanges with girls and work.My mom isn't a teacher and my dad works fulltime but i still relate to how his dad fixes food..This is a great book but the writer had him get in to much trouble."
3,Zak's out standing book review,The title is called Eyeballs for Breakfast.The main characters are Murphy and Ashley.The problem in this book is that he dislikes girls and there is a girl that likes him. This story takes place in a school and at his house.The author that wrote this book is M.M.Ragz.I have learned that if your mean to others they will be mean back.I have also learned to coperate with elders and others.The friendship is the most important in a persons life.All the people should be healthy and eat great.If you trust people a lot they can help you in tight situations.I think that the book was interesting about the way Ashley and Muphy act toward each other.This story relates to my life by my parents wanting my life to be heathy.This relates to my life by the brother picking on me.

This is my opinion about this book."
4,Kellie's Wonderful Facts On Eyeballs for Breakfast,"This book is called ""Eyeballs for Breakfast"".The author of this book is M.M Ragz.The main characters are Murphy and Ashley.It took place at Murphy's school and his neighborhood.The main problem was that Murphy and Ashley are always fighting.A lesson that can be learned is cooperation.Murphy would have to realize that he would have to get along with Ashley.Also responsibility can be learned.Murphy had to be responsible and eat healthy.You could also learn respect because Muurphy had to respect his father's wishes to eta healthier.My opinion is that this is a reallly good book.I like that when Murphy would be mean to Ashleyshe would be mean back.This relates to me because when a boy is mean to me I be mean back.Also Ashley and I are alike in many ways.Ilike the fact that this book makes me laugh and it is a really awesome book!"

5,"Offenbach - Les contes d'Hoffmann / Araiza, Ramey, Lind, Studer, J. Norman, von Otter, Staatskapelle Dresden, Tate","Offenbach - Les contes d'Hoffmann / Araiza, Ramey, Lind, Studer, J. Norman, von Otter, Staatskapelle Dresden, Tate is a recording under the direction of Jeffrey Tate who leads the Staatskapelle Dresden in this 1992 Philips Classics Productions. The booklet is close to 400 pages long and is packed with photographs of the performers, and the conductor. It also contains well-written linernotes by the conductor himself entitled ""The True Tales of Hoffman"". The lyrics are available in English, French, German and Italian. Being a Swede I am very proud to have Anne Sofie Von Otter do the parts of La Muse/Nicklausse. The sound quality is splendid and it verily feels as if one is watching it live. A truly amazing opera not to be missed. 5/5."
4,Three Tenors,"This album was clearly a ""pickup group"" put together for the commercial Christmas Season. Having said that, it is an enjoyable experience to hear these three gentlemen harmonizing so fluidly. Although Mr. Carreras's power can't equal the two giants singing with him, the engineering successfully levels the signal.I love Christmas albums, and this is no exception. There is nothing controversial, experimental, or challenging. What you get is a lovely seasonal collection of masters who truly sing like angels."
3,"Live recorded, not studio","Many, if not all, the songs appear to be recorded live, complete with applause. Thus, the quality may not as good as studio recorded music. But they are still good for casual listening."
5,Show lead for 4H dog show kids.,"Nice quality for the money, easy to put on and take off your dog and it comes in colors you can match with your outfits."
4,The Bloody Countrty,"The Bloody County is a magnificent book. Sometimes it gets boring by telling to much informantion at one time, but then becomes good by picking up the story really quick.The story is based on a young boy named Ben Buck and his family that move from Connecticut to a placed called the Wyoming River Valley. The government one day comes and tell them that they have to move because another family rightfully owns this land, but the family won't leave. The next week Indians that work for the government come and scalp Ben's mother and his sister's husband. This scares the whole family and they split up. This book has its ups and downs but in the end comes out to be a pretty good book. The best part of the book is when the river floods, pulling a family and their canoe into the raging stream and then the Buck family saves them. I recommend this book to a person this book to a person that likes to read about early settlement in the U.S."
5,Get on the dance floor,"These works span Mozart's creative life. In that respect it's a good way to see his artistic development---if you can keep still and resist the urge to dance. Hey, I don't dance, so I listen to a few CDs in a row and it doesn't get boring. That's Mozart's gift; the music just flows on and on, so why fight it. True, true: the music is played perfectly here. Cheers!"
3,Overdose,"I very much hate to be the only one giving this set less than 5 stars but one CD alone containing 46 minuets is a bit much for me. Of my entire 'Complete Mozart Edition' collection, this is the set that I play the least. It is hard to focus on Mozart's immeasurable genius in these short dance pieces -- you lose concentration after the first five dances because the arrangements are all rather similar. One can almost sense that these compositions were written as more a performance of duty or for income purpose than from pure inspiration. Some of the more fully scored (i.e., more than string trio) dances are more pleasurable."
2,Not Pleased,"There were not 250,000 images like it said. Only 25,000 and the rest on web but when i tried to get the free 1-year subscription they said it was no longer available for free but for $159.00 and that the item i bought was out dated that amazon has had it on the shevles for long time."
3,For Schoolers,"I purchase this Item for another purpose....and there was nothing exciting. I found it frustrating to use, but that was my experience or lack of it.Lesson to be learnt: I have found from buying a few similar items_ the more clip art, the more junk you have to sort through."
4,GOOD READING,"This was a very enlightening book. I can really relate to Naomi. She has helped me realize that I can do all the things I want to do, it might take me a little time, but I must work hard. Naomi is a role model for all African American women. I also STONGLY recommend Miss Briscoe's first novel ""Sisters and Lovers"". Anyone with sisters or very close lifelong sisterfriend will appreciate this one"

I LOVE U CONNIE BRISCOE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! U R THE GREATEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Too Close,"The acting is beyond superb. Ms. Suzman IS Cleopata. My only complaint is the directing. This DVD consists of 90% talking heads. The close up lens for the camera was obviously the only one available. The play is done on a stage, but it is almost never seen. Way too too much facial."
4,but there's a major problem...,"Being a TV version of a famous RSC production, this is indeed (mainly) an excellent version of the play, with the actors well into their roles by means of stage experience. However, there's a major flaw: presumably to render the length palatable for TV audiences in the late '60s, the performance cuts out the important Sextus Pompey subplot. If this role (and that of his pirate allies) is excised, we lose some crucial political, military and historical detail which enrich the play and the characters of both Antony and Octavius. Check out the text for details, and you will see what I mean. So, loss of a star (and I nearly made it two) for such thoughtless interference! My first choice must be with the BBC Shakespeare version, beautifully and thoughtfully directed by Jonathan Miller, with Jane Lapotaire and Colin Blakely both first-class. The RSC version remains a wonderful -if irritatingly incomplete- second choice."
2,Sketchy at best,"If you are looking for a film that will capture your interests through visual effects, this is not it. The actors do an excellent job of portraying their respective characters, but the play is still very long and tedious to watch. I would rather read the play, or see it live, then watching this version of it."
5,Works great with Logitech Z-2300!,"Recently I purchased a Logitech Z-2300 speaker system at a great price from Amazon to use primarily with our TV/DirectTV. I knew it was really designed to use with a computer system, but the reviews were so good that I thought I'd give it a try. Sure enough - as everyone said - the Z-2300 bass and volume were astounding. But the midrange was surprisingly weak. Some reviewers stated that using a software equalizer would improve the Z-2300 a lot so I figured, why not try a hardware equalizer? I seached for info and found that the EQ100 was very highly rated so I bought one from Amazon and it made a tremendous difference. The EQ100 has an equalizer in/out button that you can press to immediately hear the difference it makes. And it makes a BIG difference. Strangely, the sound seems ""wider."" For $60 I'm happy."
3,It sounds like a Download album.,"The original concept behind the Plateau project was chronic-induced detroit-technoish minimalism. This cd sounds alot more like a Download (another of Cevin Key's projects) album. I guess that I prefer the more spontaneous sound of the first Plateau cd (music for grass bars), to the structured, melodic sound of this one. If you're looking for something like Music for Grass Bars, I think this cd might disappoint you. However, if you like Download this might be the one for you. Not an entirely bad cd, just released under the wrong name."
4,Interesting,"An excellent cd. Not quite as exciting as some of Key's other works, but still an adventerous listen. I would recommend it for anyone who is into a bit of experimental."
5,get baked and let the music do the thinking for you,"This album is great, cEvin key and Phil Western once again put all other electronic artist to shame with this melodic collage of funky beats and other worldy soundscapes. It goes all the way from heavy experimental to jungle to ambient to industrial and back again all while maintaing the unique styles and talents of key and Western. If you like the first album, Download, or cEvin's solo work then you'll love this CD."
3,For die-hard Lovelace fans only,"Not up to the standard of the Betsy and Tacy series, but it does allow one more visit to Deep Valley for those who long to go there."
3,Yet another illustrated picture book,"What I hoped I was getting was a design book that would teach the concepts and principles behind minimal design. What I receieved, however, was yet another picture book of business cards, stationary, annual reports, and posters that other designers have created with the standard boilerplate verbage attached. You know what I mean:""This beautiful piece was created for the ABC foundation's annual report. Created by XYZ design in three hours on a $25 budget, it illustrates the simple but bold use of colored lines on paper and allows text to flow to any length desired.""As I said, boilerplate. The bottom line is, if you want yet another ""idea"" book with--don't get me wrong--some pretty good designs shown then feel free to buy. If you're looking, as I was, for more of a ""how to"", then this book isn't it."
3,a servicable retelling of the origin episode,"If you've seen the opening origin episode of the Justice League cartoon on Cartoon Network, you'll know the story that this novel tells. It follows the action verbatim, adapting the three parts of that tale into a single book. But, it also adds some details in the narrative, things subtly missing from the animated adventure itself. For viewers of the show only, it adds a little depth into these heroic characters. For that alone, it is worth recommending to the fans of the show."
4,A Must Read for People Dealing with C Level Executives,"I have dialed the phone over 250,000 times in the past 25+ years. Most of those calls were trying to reach C level executives of companies across North America. This is one of the best books on sales I have ever read.Tom 2 tall Cunningham[...]"
5,Selling To Vito,"I have purchased Anthony's books and used his methods for over 7 years. I've been the number one or number two sales representative in my sales category for for six consecutive years. I believe one of the main reasons for my consistency is the fact that my sales process typically starts with the person who can sign the check.I highly recommend Mr Parinello and his books to anyone that wants to speed up the sales cycle, have more fun, and make more money :)"
4,Must be culturally adaptable,"I have found this book excellent in gaining access to the right person - however M. Bosworth's ""solution selling"" is a beeter guide to the whole process.I have also found the book to be very ""American"" and have had to adapt (tone down) some of the tactics for Australian use."
1,"Gimicky, Misses the Point","This book talks about the importance of selling to the top, for the sake of selling to the top. It's full of gimicks and tricks to get you a meeting with the person on the top.Sometimes a few gimicks and tricks are useful. But call it what it is."
4,Great read,This book is filled with great practical advice and wonderful stories and examples. Tony guides you through selling at a differnt level. Take this advice and you are guarnteed to sell more.
3,it is a useful book for beginers.,"Mr. Parinello seems to have some unresolved issues with those of us who graduated from college. I have never before encountered a person who is so full of contempt for engineers, accountants, programmers, managers, and all other professionals who chouse to graduate from University rather than make cold calls to little old ladies.Putting Mr. Parinello's high-school drop out attitudes towards education aside, the book is not too bad. If you have never sold anything to an organization before then you can learn a decent approach from this book and then adopt it to your own situation. Just don't take Parinello's cheesy pitches too seriously. You will make a fool of yourself in front of the top managers you will talk to. Many if not most of them got an MBA degree. They will catch your bluff it you try to talk to them about financial concepts that you don't know much about."
1,Should be called 100 Cheesy cold call techniques,"As other readers have indicated, this book is cheesey. And the techniques are fundatmentally flawed. The book is so poorly written as to be almost laughable.For many if not most of you, VITO doesn't want to hear what you have to say, and he's not the guy making the decision. Parinello is just plain wrong. He has a few valid points, but they're so interspersed with garbage that it's hard to cull them out.You won't be worse off for reading this book, other than the time you've lost. You'll pick up a few important sales concepts. But how are you going to know which ones they are?Finally, I'll say the author is somewhat bold in his claims. Like one of his claims to write back to every piece of correspondance he receives. I'm still waiting, Tony, 6 months later!"
2,THE CROSS OF ST. MARO,"KEADY IS NO VINCE FLYNN. HAVING READ ALL THE ""MITCH RAPP"" BOOKS AND READING THAT FLYNN RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK, I GAVE KEADY'S BOOK A SHOT. NOT EVEN CLOSE! KIND OF REMINDS ME OF THE CLANCY BOOKS OF LATE...TOO MUCH HISTORY AND BACKGROUND ABOUT INSIGNIFICANT PEOPLE PLACE AND THINGS. WHEN ONE GETS TO THE END YOU ARE LEFT WITH A FELLING THAT YOU JUST WASTED A LOT OF TIME.I FOUND MYSELF SCANNING MUCH OF THIS BOOK UNTIL I GOT BACK TO THE MAIN STORY. ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING CHARACTERS ""REDWOOD"" IS NEVER FULLY DEVELOPED THOUGH I SUSPECT HE WILL APPEAR IN A FOLLOW UP BOOK.ALTHOUGH THE BOOK STARTS OFF FAST AND GETS YOU INTERESTED MID WAY INTO THE BOOK I QUESTIONED IF I SHOULD FINISH IT OR NOT."
1,Horrible quality and durability,"We play ball in the backyard every evening and wanted a replacement for another foam bat that we had used for over three years. Within 4 days, the end cap, near the barrel, popped off, and then 1 week later, the entire yellow foam part of the bat disconnected from the grip and the entire yellow piece flew off the bat during a swing. This was a complete waste of money. Don't buy this bat and expect it to last more than 2 weeks."
5,great reading and more,Just love Dr Lew I think I have 1 or 2 of all his books. It is great reading to live by. What Is IS! and you need to read it! and all the others he has written. He is JUST AWESOME!!!
1,Inaccurate information,"The author makes many inaccurate statements throughout the book.Specific example: The high bypass engine was developed for noise reduction.False. The engine was developed for the needs of the military contractwith commercial manufactures to develop a large transport aircraft (the C-5)in 1965. Noise suppression was a by-product. The FAA was not garnered anypower over noise reduction until 1969. The EPA did not exist until 1972.There are many others.Also, the author gives advice and suggestion how to ""beat"" a clear violation!Ethically, he is on the same level as a criminal lawyer who attempts to freea guilty party. If you violate FARs, you are in danger of causing a human factoraccident and killing others. You should have your certificate suspended to protect others!As a University professor, I will have to point out the errors to students.I will only use this book for one semester and find another."
1,Not so great,"Not really up to date, but neither is the text. Too much personal opinion and short on the real law. Weak on contracts and torts. Not the best selection of books, unless your prof requires it."
2,just plain odd,"Out of all the great stuff out there for doulas & midwives, this isn't one of them. It's just odd. So 70's. Natural childbirth should be ""natural"" - teaching white women to make noises like they are from the Indian culture is not natural. I recommend any of Ina Mae Gaskins works or Penny Simkins stuff leagues above this. I know some people will disagree - fine - to each her own."
2,Norman is an absolute Isolde but.....Carmen?,"What can I say of an absolute wonderful soprano who has a blooper? Carmen is not for her. She sounds so soft, that no man's heart can sense the Carmen's traditional dangerous fire.The Orchestra sound is spectacular, but lacks of the grandeur that Ozawa has in Philips' Carmina Burana, for example. I am big Norman Fan, but I think she was born for singing spirituals, or Isolde or Poulenc Songs. The Figaro Countess under Davies is absolutely delicious. What can I say? Carmen is not for her.But she is a wonderful singer. Period. My Carmen is Julia Migenes and Placido Domingo under Lorin Maazel."
2,Stay away from this recording,"I have no idea who was the ""genius"" who thought of Jessye Norman as Carmen. It is a pity that such an important singer as she turned out such a disastrous performance. Everything is wrong in her portrayal: sense of style, characterisation, charm...,the Don Jose and the Escamillo are hardly better, only Mirella Freni, even well past her prime, gives any pleasure. Ozawa conducts a grandiloquent, verismo Carmen, like they used to do in the 50's. Even if you are a fan of Norman, I would strongly recommend to stay away from this recording. If you are looking for a truly great recording of Carmen look no further than Teresa Berganza/Claudio Abbado in DG, the best recording ever of Bizet's masterpiece. Other good alternatives are Victoria de los Angeles/Beecham and Tatiana Troyanos/Solti, but Berganza is the most passionate and magical Carmencita of all."
1,Simply dull,"I have given this recording more than just a few chances and I just cannot help but almost falling asleep everytime I listen to it! And Carmen is supposed to be a fun opera, so there MUST be something wrong here!There are a lot of good recordings out there and many time-transcending Carmens who's seduction skills will work their magic on you MUCH better than this one! I prefer Callas above all as Carmen...Avoid this one"
4,Stories that will haunt you,"This is a collection of raw yet vibrant stories -- an increasing rarity in a world where the ""novel in stories"" or the ""girl's guide to stories"" are the big market sellers. This is a book that should be read slowly, allowing the reader's own emotions to rise and fall with Pancake's stark yet skilled prose. More than once I had to set the book aside, only to be drawn back to a world where often it seems that nothing more can possibly happen -- the flood is over, the baby has died -- but you come away with the feeling that something might happen. That something MUST. I highly recommend this book."
5,Best Collection of Mozart Piano Concertos Available,"This is an unbeatable combination: Alfred Brendal on piano and Academy of saint martin in the fields orchestra. I have listened to all of the main pianist playing these 27 concertos, only Murray Perahia can come close to this one. If you really like these concertos, get this set and Murray Perahia's set, they are both superb but sound quite different. If you have to chose one, choose this one. Dont consider any of the other pianists."
5,Excellent!,"Although I am Ella Fitzgerald fan, true is I got really surprised about Concert in Budapest. It really is Ella at her best ever."
3,Interesting mix of new and old,"Just when you thought you had heard everything Ella had ever sung, along comes this interesting mix from a 1970 concert with an instrumental trio. From old (""Summertime,"" ""As Time Goes By"")to (then) new (Bert Bacharach, Harry Nilsson), Ella tries a little bit of everything. Definitely not among her 5-star best, but well worth owning if you're looking for something different."
1,"Lazy, inaccurate reporting and terribly disappointing","Here is all I needed to read to realize what a lazy, slap-dash book this is: Golenbock calls the most important player in Mets history, their only true Hall of Famer, by the WRONG NAME! Tom Seaver's birth name is GEORGE THOMAS SEAVER. Golenbock calls him THOMAS GEORGE SEAVER.There are many other errors as well, as pointed out in previous reviews here.As a life-long, die-hard Mets fan, I looked forward to this book.Unfortunately, it was obviously rushed to print in time for the Mets 40th anniversary season, because the mistakes and laziness are obvious.The author and his editors should be embarrassed."
2,Very lazy writing on Golenbock's part,"For the Mets history prior to 1984, the writing is palatable and alot of facts presented are interesting. However, in comparison to some of his previous works that I have read (The Bronx Zoo, Esposito, Number 1), this book is sorely lacking in both accuracy, editing and overall writing proficiency. I was a Golenbock fan as a youth when I read ""The Bronx Zoo"", but it seems as the years pass by, he sort of views his writing ability anymore as one who merely has to put his name on the cover, and the book sells itself. Well, luckily I was at St. Vincent de Paul when I found and bought this book, and for the most part, outlaying $2.99 was well worth it for the first part of the Mets history. However, if faced with the prospect of paying anything than $5.00, I would steer clear."
1,awful,"Even though I know i'm not saying something that wasnt shared already, this was an absolutely horrible book on the history of the mets. Easily the worst made. Golenback and his editors should be ashamed of themselves. The first time I read it, I believe I counted 39 or 40 blatant factual errors."
2,"Dismaying, not Amazing","It took me almost a year to read this book because I kept getting bored, but being a longtime fan of the Mets I kept coming back to it, hoping to get to the 'good parts.' The part of this book that recounted the 1986 team's exploits was good, but not great. The rest of the book was OK, but not good. That's not good enough.Golenbock's book is very repetitive. Passages are quoted almost verbatim from previous passages. The 2000 Mets and beyond are recounted only through the words of Al Leiter, making the last 70 pages entirely unreadable and unenjoyable. Whole years and eras in Mets' history are brushed by, with almost nothing being written about the early '90s teams, or late '70s teams. The whole awful Vince Coleman experience is done with in 3 sentences.Extremely disappointing."
2,Skip This,"I'm a huge Mets fan, and if i had to summarize this book in word, it would be ""uneven."" Because it's an oral history, you frequently only are presented with one viewpoint. That's understandable, but it's Golenbock's job to then bring up the counterpoint, which he does not often do.The book is rife with spelling errors and factual mistakes. Who edited this? The last few chapters covering the Bobby Valentine era are pretty much an Al Leiter showcase, as NO other players from that era are quoted.Poor showing by Golenbock. Suitable only for the diehard Mets fan who just wants a refresher of what he already knows/read."
3,Doesn't quite bring it.,"Great book for Mets fans, though the book does make you grit your teeth at times, mostly because of the factual errors already mentioned by other reviewers here and because of Golenbock's overreliance on the published memoirs of others, particularly the horrifically written Strawberry's. I also think that too few members of the Mets are or would consent to be interviewed. For instance, what's a history of the NY Mets without the POV of Ed Kranepool, who spanned three distinct eras of the team?The best account of the Mets, though only up through '73, remains Leonard Koppett's THE NEW YORK METS. If you're interested in details and a solid analysis of the Mets transformation from bottom dogs to World Champs, Koppett's the one to beat."
2,"all loose nails, throwing an empty no brand box. Never buy it again",never buy it again this type of loose nail throw in an empty brown box.
3,Mixed Bag,"Overall this is a pretty good set of the most popular Mozart fortepiano sonatas on a period instrument (and the only one I've found with a collection of this sort). But there are some strange anomolies here. For example, in K.332 the piano goes out of tune, or the recording changes pitch in a strange way, I can't tell which! Does anyone else notice this? What is that? You can here it on the samples provided here if you listen closely."
1,USELESS,"Lets just cut to the chase as a sofa or chair cushion seat it is useless, use a piece of wood paneling"
2,sagging sofa support,"Offers a little support, but it is very slick and the cushions slide off of the sofa. If they were covered in fabric, I think they would work much better."
3,So So...,"It only helped my sofa a little. I bought one chair size and 1 sofa size - I put the chair one on top of the sofa one in the area where we sit the most. But it only helped a little. I believe this would work best in an old sofa where the support BELOW the cushion is broken down. In my case it is the cushion that is too soft, so putting support below it didn't help that much."
1,A waste of money.,This product was a total waste of money. It does not provide any support at all and is now sitting in a closet.
2,"Great, for two days...","When I put this into place then put my cushions on, I was surprised that it did seem to do the trick. After about two days though the couch sags just as much as it always had. I even folded the support over to double up on the side of the couch that is sat on the most, and even that doesn't make a difference. So to the people suggesting maybe buying two, you'd be wasting twice as much money."
3,Didn't help,The shipment is fast; the quality is good. But it didn't help me with my sofa. I would not recommend or buy it again.
1,DON'T BUY IT,"I should have paid attention to the other reveiwers and after one day, I threw it out. Lost money on product that does not work. The TV commercials were a joke."
1,One won't due. You might want to try at least two!,"One of these on a couch definitely will not due. You may want to purchase two however it will be a little pricey. You will probably be better off buying a sheet of 3/8"" high grade plywood. The plywood will definitely do the trick."
1,this product SUCKS!!,OMG Very disappointed. This product sucks thought it might help our couch and it did not at all not satisfied in the least
2,Worked for now.,"I won't give this a 1 star rating because it did work as it was supposed to. My Fiance and I are both overweight, not a lot, but enough. So after months of use, the couch begins to sag. I bought these things to fix the issue. They worked amazingly well for a while.These things are a great cheap temporary fix, but lack long term. They are very thin and not very durable. You could bend them by hand. If you're not overweight and need a fix, I'd check it out, but if you are, look for something more solid. A quick fix isn't the answer."
2,sofa support,I don't see where this item does much to support a sagging couch. My couch still has minimal support. Would not purchase again. Wasted my money
2,Nearly Useless,"We got a new couch that sags like crazy, as maybe it's not so much ""new"" as it is ""new to us."" Whatever. Technicalities.I ordered this as a surprise to my parents. It works great for support for us - not too much, not too little. But when I put it under the cushions, it slides back. Soon the first 4-5 inches have no support, meaning you sag in one spot and are sturdy in the other.If it was wider, we'd like it. We've gotten used to our sagging couch now though. So - it's good if you have a thin couch. Not if it's a normal size, though."
3,Worked a little,This worked a little but not enough to be worth the money. If I didn't tell my wife it was there I don't think she would have noticed anything was different.
2,Doesn't work,"This product is a good idea but it really didn't work for my couch. Didn't seem to help at all. Not sure if other couches springs are designed different and would be a better fit for this product, but it didn't work for me."
2,dont buy this if you have a big couch,Spread the thing out and it doesn't fit. Bought the largest size they had figuring it would work. Nope. I would be better going out to Lowes to buy a 1/4 plywood and cutting it to size. At least I know that would give support. Don't buy this product cause it doesn't work at all.
2,Not long enough,Ordered NO SAG SUPPORTS for 2 sofas. They were too short - seemed to be for fitting for loveseats. I am still using them although they do not run from end to end
2,Sofa Fix,This product did not prevent the couch from sagging. It is also too short for the couch. I don't think it performed 'as advertised'.
4,Lasted about 7 years...then gave my wife a shock!,"My wife used this little pump to pump treated water in a 55-gal plastic garbage can into her 75-gal fish tank for her monthly water change procedure. It worked great for the first 7-years! It worked great until last weekend when she reached in to lift the pump out of the almost empty garbage can (all but the last few inches of water had just finished pumping out). She got a jolt when she touched the pump. Obviously, the housing seal must be breached somewhere. There appears to be no damage to the pump housing whatsoever. It still looks almost new! And when I opened the bottom panel...the only panel I could seem to find that would open...there was just a silicon-sealed section that I presume contained the motor and other electrical parts for the pump. There were no obvious breaches of that seal either. So I just have no idea how or why this pump failed. It still runs! But it's too dangerous to use. Gonna buy a new one."
2,"Rigged ""Sport""","This book visits the rise of pro wrestling's popularity in its hundred year history, focusing mostly on 80s and early 90s stars. I know wrestling is rigged, for sure after reading Hulk Hogan's autobiographry where he actually admits to it. Doesn't mention the monday night wars in which WCW beat WWF for 52 consecutive weeks in a row on TV ratings. The outcomes of the matches are predetermined and such and such agrees or refuses to job. Overall, a mediocre book about a kind of guilty pleasure that is pro wrestling. I admit I still watch TNA on Thursday nights."
5,Great for beginners,"If Scully, Henisch, Bober and Flandrin are household words in your kitchen, you can skip this book and miss little. If you're just beginning to enjoy medieval cookery, and would like to get the ""big picture"" this is the perfect introduction.It's not a cookbook -- it's a survey of what foods were used, how they were prepared, and how they were understood to work in the body. The author has sifted through the works of medieval cooks and those who have translated and studied them, and brings us the essence of medieval cookery in a very readable form. She is careful to distinguish between the foods of the elite and the poor. She discusses regional variations as well as the many international foods. Influences of both religion and medieval science (humoral theory) on eating habits are well discussed.Extensive bibliographic notes will aid the reader in finding the sources of her information."
1,weak bat,The bat cracked within one afternoon of use. We were using standard wiffle brand balls to hit.
4,Great Water Blaster,We've tried several blasters. This one is better than theTurbo Twist Motorized Blaster Water Gun.
2,Fun toy watergun,This product is essentially a souped up water gun with a battery operated compressor. I was a bit surprised that it did not come with a 110-220 powerpack. It's a bit overpriced for what you get but fun just the same.
2,Cast list mistaken,"This performance does not feature Thomas Allen alas, he would have been better than the raw Ganzarolli), but Richard van Allan.To me Cotrubas gives the only first class performance on this unfortuantely vocalized set."
3,2nd rate Ferrando,"As a tenor I appreciate great tenor voices in the more famous tenor roles. The role of Ferrando has most definately been played in higher esteem, by people such as Jerry Hadley (Scottish Chamber version). I have not actually explored the other voices, but Gedda does not fit my inner expression of the role of Ferrando."
5,Some favorites,This did have some favorites from childhood on it and looked far better than we've seen in the past. Nice price too!
5,Essential Math Knowledge,The content in this textbook is what we should have been taught in High School instead of Trigonometry and Pythagoras Theorem. Very practical and relevant. Essential knowledge for everyone!!
3,Good but Not Complete,"This book has short (3 to 5 page) reviews of 30 or so rifles. Many of the more popular rifles are reviewed (Browning A-bolt, and Marlin 336). Many of the more popular ones are not. The Remington 700 is missing. However the information provided is of good quality. The author has fired all of the rifles reviewed, notices their accuracy, quality of workmanship, and price level. The book is good for what it does. If you are thiking of buying a rifle, this book can be helpful, however with so many popular rifles not covered you should make certain that the guns that interest you are covered before buying this book."
3,Not the punk/ska Goldfinger that you might be expecting,"I just bought this album because the other reviews on this page made it seem like it was a CD by Goldfinger, whom I am a big fan of, when in fact it is by a band from Spain which sounds nothing like the Goldfinger that I know and love. I just didnt want anyone else to spend their money on this CD only to find that it is not at all what they were expecting...That is all"
1,I dont know what some of these chumps are talking about,"This CD is not by Goldfinger, artists behind hang ups, stomping ground, and self-titled. One of the other reviews says that Darrin doesn't sing on track 6....this of course is true because Darrin is not in Goldfinger and the Mushpotatoes....consequently, Darrin doesn't sing on any of the songs. I cant bellisima is NOT a great punk/ska effort as it was said to be by one of the other reviews...because it is not a punk/ska effort in the first place. I just wanted to make sure that no one else gets all excited about a previously undiscovered goldfinger album, spends like 25 dollars to order it, and then listens to only part of the album before smashing their stereo in a beserker rage.this has been a public service announcement from a concerned listener like you."
1,what the hell is going on here?,"i go to this web site and it says that this cd is our beloved well-known goldfinger, on another web site, it says that this is an import from spain, i was going to but this but, not after all this confusion, if this is really goldfinger, why haven't i ever heard of this cd until about 2 days ago?keep it real yo!"
4,Goldfinger are still great,"The album I Can't Bellisima is great. Although it may be a bit like hang ups the tunes are still excellent. The first 6 tracks are the best but the others are still cool. It may not be as good as the album ""Goldfinger"" it is alot better than ""Stomping Ground"". Goldfinger should release more albums like this one because this is what they do best. I Can't Bellisima is a good example on how Goldfinger still rock"
4,Why the Hell Not?!!,Why is this movie not available on NTSC and in Region 1? What are they thinking? It's a fine movie - a bit of a stretch to imagine Mr. Hopkins in the role - but he does a fantastic job! Hello! Lawyers/Distributers/Contract Holders! We want this film on DVD! We will pay for it! C'Mon!!!
1,poor resolution,Poor resolution and the screen can not be expanded. The sound was ok but still the quality of the image at some point was just blur.
3,The life of A Hopkins the painter,"I would still purchase this knowing what I know now, for the subject matter. However Anthony Hopkins performance is to Picasso's passion as central park is to the rain forest. The key to all great art, visual or performance is that the work must never show, it must appear effortless. However the work must exist. I have the feeling Mr. Hopkins phoned this one in. There is never a sense of under lying power, danger just beneath the surface that may erupt at any moment. No real emotional life just superficial words spoken in the typical A Hopkins manner, as a man without passion. Had Picasso been so there would have been no art as there is none in Mr Hopkins performance. Not that it is bad...it just is non existent. The rest of the cast was full of life and passion, I felt their pain and their joy. I rated this a three because I enjoyed the lesson about the life of Picasso, but the performance of Hopkins, well, the Bull had no horns and was quiet sedate."
4,Great workhorse!,"I am a contractor that bought this gun last year for nailing on cement plank siding and trim. It worked great, and we never had a problem shooting ring shank nails into the cement board nailing onto old yellow pine framing. I have since used it on all types of wood siding, more cement board, some fencing, and a lot of exterior trim repair. This gun is sturdy and very reliable. Nails for this gun are everywhere in all sizes.Why not five stars? I would like to see the depth gauge easier to adjust. It takes longer to locate the wrench than to adjust the gun, but once adjusted it stays put. However, most guns that are used for utility purposes now have easy adjustments that don't require any tools. This really should be more of a 4 1/2 stars rating since I like the reliability so much."
3,Just OK,"I had high hopes that this could take out ball point ink. I was not that pleased. It does sort of reduce it, but it still leaves a very noticeable line, just fainter than the original. To really reduce the visibilty of ink you're almost erasing right through the paper. The pencil side seems to work fairly well. You should also know that these erasers are somewhat thinner than the Pink Pearls. You're getting 24 in the box, but they're not big and fat. It's a good product, but it's not a great deal."
3,Parts/Instructions missing!,"Was please with the fast delivery! Would have given it a 5 rating, but was disappointed that there were no instructions in package. But there was a sheet of paper entitled ""Vinyl Personalization Application Instructions"" showing how to apply vinyl plastic numbers on the side of your mailbox! UNSAT! There was a screw missing and the only reason I knew how to install the flag was because I have used one before and my mailbox had the hole/screw already drilled. But I envisioned someone receiving this packaged as it was delivered, then being totally confused on how to install. This isn't CUSTOMER SERVICE! FYI!"
2,Broke within 1 year,"Was great while it worked. The tab that fits under the mailbox door, broke off within a year. Will not buy this product again and do not recommend it."
2,Doesn't fit my mailbox,It wasn't clear in description that it was wrong for my mailbox. I found the mail chime device more suited for my situation.
3,Way over-priced.,"With S&H charges this device cost over $16. It has about $1.50 worth of material. They send it to you with one mounting hole, and tell you that you need to drill another one.Why don't they drill 2 holes? They don't even include mounting screws! All I can say good about it is: so far it works....well the first time anyway."
1,Mail Box Alert,The problem with this mail box alert is that it is made of aluminum and the tip that holds it down until the mail comes bends and breaks off within about 6 months of use.
1,Mail alert,I like this product because it is vary simple to install and use.I can also see that I have mail as I'm getting home unlike the new battery operated ones. The last one I had lasted for well over ten years.So a good value for your dollar.
4,mail time alert,works great for the price. wish the tab that fits in the mailbox was a little more fitted to the mailbox lip so the mailbox would close smoother
2,Mail Flag,This Mail Flag does not work on extra large rural mailboxes. I assume it will work fine on a standard size rural mail box.
4,step saver,We bought this for my elderly parents. It saves them unnecessary trips to the mailbox. That will be especially nice in the winter. We found it easy to install. It does need the additional screw that is suggested for stability. I gave it four stars instead of five because I think that screw should have been included.
4,Just what I needed.,"I couldn't find this item anywhere in the stores and after 15 years, ours was beyond repair. Glad it was so easily found on amazon.com. The flag arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected."
4,works great...however,"I have been using this product for about 12 years. I just ordered my 5th alert. the problem with the design is the small tab breaks off too easy. Also, if the company changed the spring to a stainless steel spring, the flag would last alot longer."
1,POS,"If you have one of these that has lasted twenty years, it's not the same thing as this piece of junk. Mine lasted six days and the flag broke off at its base. Save your money."
3,Useful but not perfect,This product works well but after time the thin metal tang which resets the device (between device and mailbox door) suffers metal fatique and breaks.I'll only lived in my current home forfive years and I'm on my third device.
4,Works OK,"After I got it installed it works OK. Somehow it doesn't quite fit on my mailbox where the previous model did. With further guidance from vendor I had to drill holes in mailbox and install this on a sort of angle. It uses a strip of plastic to lodge between the door and the box. Don't know how long that will last and the flag is at an angle but it does seem to work, if imperfect. It does alert you when mail has arrived just be prepared to do some work first."
3,"Minor problems, easy to overcome","Like the concept, Unit came with a bent tab. Directions say not to bend it, the paint will crack. The paint was cracked. Of course the mail box I had was not compatible because of the latch. Wasn’t hard to make it work. For the price, wasn’t worth sending it back. Unit works great I'm about 300' from the mail box. I would buy it again."
3,Mail Time Mail Alert,"The Mail Alert arrived in a timely manner, but I was disappointed in the small strap that you have to fastened with the door of the mail box. After re-reading the description, it told why they did this and it was because the latch did not last very long, so they just put a small nylon fastener and said when it wore out, you could replace for about 4 cents each. I have had one of these mail alerts for 5 years or so and the latch was still intact and working fine. So I only wished they had not changed the design.But I like my Alert as I can tell when the carrier has been to my box, just not the NEW design of it."
3,mailbox flag,i love the fact i dont have to go out in an ice storm or blizzard or 0 temps to see if i have mail. now i know everytime the mail man goes and i have mail. love it
1,One Reason The Tab Breaks,"Some reviewers have noted the flag tab breaks prematurely. The tab is designed to hold the flag in the down position with the mailbox door closed but I have been using the same flag for over 30 years. When the original unit's spring failed, I ordered a total replacement unit and when it arrived I saw the aluminum was about half the thickness of my original and the tab could easily be bent. I simply repainted my old flag and switched it onto the new base. I now repaint it and replace the spring as needed.The manufacturer took a good innovative product and found a way to cheapen it."
1,Nope,"Messy,tedious and innefective, that about sums it up, I simply gave up after a couple tries though if you don't have stubburn hair this may be a better alternative to harsh chemicals."
2,Went back to epilator,"I tried this waxing product three times. It left the skin on my arms red and irritated, with each hair follicle evident. Professional waxing at a salon is incredibly better."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I'm not sure if it works for anyone else, but it did NOT remove ANY of my facial hair even with multiple tries. It hurt like hell, and it did absolutely NOTHING else..."
4,Gets the job done,"I bought this for my chest, stomach, and lower back because I'm just too hairy in some places for my own liking. It does a good job of removing body hair if you apply the goo to trimmed hair and your technique is good (there is a MOOM instructional video on YouTube). It's painful but that should be expected when you are ripping hair out by the root. The worst part is that between the application of the goo (very viscous), the hair removal, and the cleanup, the whole process can take up a pretty sizable chunk of time. I don't know that I can fault this product in particular for that, as that may be true of regular waxing as well. But when all is said and done, MOOM does what it is supposed to, and it will only occasionally miss maybe 5% of hair at worst."
1,Does not work at al for me,I followed the directions and it just does not work. It is was to thick! I even tried running it under warm water but it still does not remove any hair.
4,"Takes some practice, but works","The product was a bit difficult to use at first, but with some practice I found it useful for larger, thicker hairs. I still haven't found it very easy to remove the shorter, smaller hairs, but it is possible more practice will help. It is evident that it removes the whole hair including the root. Reading the ""How To"" guide is important.Take the time to set things up well and you can avoid messes."
1,Phillips sound engineering leaves much to be desired,"Terrible sound quality - very disappointed. Muffled sound but I could live with that. It is the incessant 'clicking'/static electronic noise that is unbearable. I requested money back from the vendor. It was not expensive, but I can't bear to hear it.It may be a Phillips problem since in the same shipment I had the same problem with another Phillips CD. I like Claudio but I can't enjoy this CD due to the clicking/static. I purchased Emil Gilel's box 9-CD set of LvB's sonatas and the sound was great. I recommend passing on this one."
3,Not quite what I expected,"First of all, this is my personnal appreciation. What I say is my own advice.In general he plays to slowly.. Beethoven allways tried to play as fast as possible. He also gives a romantic touch to these sonatas who where composed for men! (except the moonlight). In the 1st & 3rd mouvement of the appassionata, he seems to be again limited by his speed possibilities. The second one is weel played. nothing to say.The first mouvememnt of the moonlight is (for me) too fast (Listen to the Solomon version), The 2nd and third mouvements are certainly the Best I've Heard with Brendel's."
3,Music quality is unbearable,"Instruction is dragging. I don't mind the moves but the music quality did not inspire me to shake my booty. I only used this once.My other African Dance work-outs:African Healing Dance with WyomaMadonna Grimes Afro Latino MovesWork-out DVD collection:Adam Ford's Swiss ball Upper body Work outNatural Journeys On the Ball Pilates with Lizbeth GarciaBalance Ball for Beginners by Suzanne DeasonTrainer's Edge(Cardio Interval Training with Petra Kolber, Killer Abs and Back with Michael Olajide)Bodywisdom Perfect CoreBilly Blanks (Boot Camp Elite, Mission 2 Maximum Power, Get Ripped Series 1 and 2StripilatesJeff Costa's Cardio Strip Tease Workout Vol. 2The Firm - Jiggle Free Arms ~ Firm-Transfirmer SeriesDance with Lisa: Red Hot Salsa Made Simple ~ Lisa NunziellaSamba Party Workout 2 - Brazilian Carnival Grooves ~ Samba Dance Workout"
2,Not enough dance flavor,This had dance moves but I just did not get the feeling of dancing. It really felt like a regular aerobics class. I have taken and was looking for more dance. and maby more authentic music to go with the dance.
4,Good Workout,"Wow! I have yet to master this DVD. You get 3 versions and i must say as much as i love it, i have not been able to run though the 45min and the 60min versions without taking breaks here and there. I like the mixture of African dances with Latin moves."
5,Get Ready To Move Your Body!,This is a great video and a great way to break up the normal workout routine and still get the cardio workout you expect. You can tell it's not rehearsed. Seemed very real. I like it.
4,Nice pan,I bought this for my mom as a small no-event gift because she didn't have this size. It seems to work quite well and it's impressively heavy for a pressed pan. I would buy another.
1,Chips and rusts quickly!,I was given this pan as a wedding present. After several months of use with coated utensils it began to crack and rust. Now there are several holes in the coating and the pan has a lot of rust spots. I would not buy this pan if I were you.I do wash this in the dishwasher every time I use it.
1,Starforce,"This game is great, it definitely beats out SimCity4 in almost every department. Graphics are nice, the social subcultures are nice, and the game is great overall. I only miss the region overview, but I'm pretty sure if they copied THAT many elements then EA would have had pretty good grounds for a lawsuit/cease and desist order.Now onto the reason I rated this game a one overall:I just paid the price of a full game so I could have Starforce installed on my computer. Just the other day I was deleting Starforce because it came on another game of mine. This form of copy-protection is nothing short of malware, and I've already had one dual-layer lightscribe DVD drive reduced to a worthless piece of scrap metal thanks to it. I'm getting tired of having to find cracks for Starforce games I buy legally just to avoid severe hardware damage... To the point where I've decided that I'm not going to buy Starforce protected products anymore."
1,Don't Bother With It,"This game sucks. It tries to be Sim City with extra features. Unfortunately, the graphics are way below average. In fact, some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student. The Interface is clumsy and not intuitive. I am a big fan of the Sim City series and this game really falls short."
2,"Good Concept, poor execution","The problem with this game is that it seems good, but it gets boring very fast. You don't really se any new development after the initial buildings. Your neighborhoods are boring looking and everyone always seems to be fighting. It's also hard to stay under budget. It seems almost impossible. Overall, the game could have been good, but it's not. Buy Sim City 4 instead. If the first person view was in Sim City 4 it would be the perfect game."
1,Misguided Copy Protection,"This is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection I've ever experienced. I bought this game new at a local store because I've been itching to play SimCity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card. Got this game home and it installed just fine, but when it came time to launch the game, it said disc authentication failed. Tried it with the other disc, failed again. Went to the company's support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them. Thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund."
1,Starforce = Hardware damage,"Don't buy it unless you want the Starforce malware on your computer. I understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy, but not at the expense of replacing the drivers I need(ed) for my DVD burner. Check the search engines and see for yourself. Would have otherwise been a great game, too bad it isn't playable because of this malware."
1,"great fun, but severely lacking in replayability","I would recommend this game as one to either rent or buy used. I love the idea behind the game. It's my job to get certain peeps to move in, and it's also my job to keep them happy and employed. The games does an outstanding job explaining to the player exactly what is needed in order to progress. So what's the problem?The problem is that there are a limited number of goals in this game, and while it is great fun getting to the point where the first elites are finally moving in, there really is nothing more to add once that point is reached. The fun curve has a severe and sharp downward curve once this point is reached, and I haven't had the ambition to pick up the game since.This is a game that is well worth a $20 bargain bin price tag, but the $50 I paid was way too much."
5,I aplaud He Is Legend for NOT CARING,"I think this release is fairly good, as far as just the music goes I give it a 4/5. What gives it the five stars is that the band almost wanted to get the kids who listened to I Am Holloywood for ""The Seduction"" and ""I Am Hollywood"" to stop listening. I think they have accomplished that by going in a completely different direction. The heavy southern rock is wonderful. It's not quite as good as I Am Hollywood, but almost there. Still worth buying. I love bands that dont care what the fans of their old cd will think about the new one, all they care about is the fans who stick around. This album creates that division. Well done He Is Legend, well done."
1,terrible,"he is legend changed there sound too much... now i usually respect bands that mature and change there sound but this sounds like trash. dont buy this cd stick to i am hollywood and hopefully if they come out with a new cd its nothing like this garbage..the singers voice sucks now tooedit - so ive come to a conclusion...basically if you like this cd, it means you also support the death penalty and drive cars in circles and drive big trucks and have bad hygene..."
4,great follow up!,"Suck Out the poison is a great follow-up to their debut album; it's different but change can be good. The guitars and drums pound in your head with ferociousness. There is definitely a dirty, Southern feel to this record, but it's works quite well. The bonus track, cape fear, is an awesome addition to the record. buy the record used in one of the stores above. its worth it since it comes with the bonus track."
4,Good but not Great,"91205-Great I am Hollywood-Great Suck out the Poison-GoodLet me start out with this band sounds completely different, it's not a bad sound, just different. You still get the screaming, but the vocals just irritate me. The instrumentals are good like always, but the vocals are a work in progress I hope.All in all the vocals don't really detain from the album, they're just different, therefore 4/5"
2,Highly Disappointed,"First and second album rocked by socks off man. I really had high hopes for this cd. I agree with one of the previous comments where they mentioned they thought the band recruited a new singer. I don't know, maybe his voice was hoarse during the recording of this album. The only reason I gave this album a second star is because it's He Is Legend, come on. At least I still have I Am Hollywood!"
2,dissappointing,"i love the last two cds, but i thought it was a different vocalist when i first heard the songs. And, that defintily is not a good thing. there are a few good songs, but its nothing compared to i am hollywood."
2,"""I Ain't Hollywood""","Never really was able to get into the album 90215 (or whatever) but EVEN IT was better than this. And where the heck is ""Cape Fear"" that was the only good song they had recorded since the last cd and it's not on here?? Download Wounded, Cape Fear, and buy I Am Hollywood..the rest is junk."
2,not very heavy or christian,I thought this would be more heavy metal sounding than it was. Also I thought the lyrics would be Christian based. I was wrong on both accounts.
3,size?,"If you are going by size, please be aware that the measurement, 10"" x 15"", is for the cooking surface only. The overall dimension of the cookie pan is approximately 11""x18"". This is too large to use in my RV oven."
1,Warped Pan,I want to like these pans because they feel high quality and the non-stick is great. Every time I put one in the oven I hear a popping noise a few minutes later. The noise is the pan warping. I only had the oven on 350 and the pan warped almost a full inch off the oven rack. This just isn't acceptable in my book so I'll be headed to the store to replace them.
2,Are you kidding?,"I do not understand the positive reviews of this book. I saw it on display in a bookstore, the first couple of pages made me laugh, and so I picked it up. It was all downhill from there. There isn't much humor, the characters are too much, the silly names are distracting, and the main character's attack of conscience was painful."
5,Absolutely the funniest satiresince Hiaasen and Buckley,"I was rolling in my seat when I read Red Meat Cures Cancer. The idea of a 300 fat gram tailburger and all the other characters in the book is great. The audacity of the King of Tailburger is great and they market to low-lifes, prison, and people with a drug problem. The way the media is distorted and dialogue crackles. It is an alternate universe and was absolutely hilarious to me - a fan of all satire like Hiassen and Buckley's thank you for Smoking.Do yourself a favor and buy this book. You will be laughing with tears running down your face if you really think about the subject.Andy G."
4,capable glide,We got the glider put together in very little time. There are just 4 bolts to screw in. Assembly is very easy. One person can do it. The glider is light but sturdy. The one we ordered looked slightly different than the online catalog picture of the Pine Glide. Ours didn't have the two middle spools on the armrest. No biggie. There is a resin smell to the fabric. It isn't noticeable unless you put your nose to the cushion. Overall a good pick.
1,Useless & Opportunistic,"What can you say about a documentary that tells you that the best way to ""prevent"" terror is to avoid it? Avoid big cities? (geez-thanks), don't fly? (hmmm, I guess we should just walk everywhere), practice racial profiling? (pretty stupid when you consider that the majority of the world (Hispanics, Mexicans, Greeks, Italians, Spaniards, Nepalese, Indians, Jews and on and on could be mistaken for the Terrorists). Not to mention the fact that we are basically painting all Middle Easterners with one brush when it is a tiny minority that have participated in Terror acts. In my life I have come across plenty of blonde blue eyed Muslims and as well as ""Arab-looking"" Americans. Give me a break! Talk about barking up the wrong tree! - All in all a misleading, unprofessional hyped product meant to cash in on the hysteria."
1,awful,"Prevent TerrorismAs an educator that offers a course in the Public Health Response to Terrorism, I found this tape terribly produced, tacky, and unprofessional. The persons responsible for the development of this video are cashing in on the fears of the public. The only reason I will talk about this in my class is to show students the various types of fear tactics used. Let's be sensible folks."
5,Great cookbook,Have been wanting this book for years. It's a good one. Her stories of food are good too. Don't miss out on this one
2,Buy this one used,"I did enjoy the book and many of the photographs were a pleasure -- however, I was SO glad I bought it used from an Amazon reseller. I would have been really annoyed if I paid anything close to list price. I felt this book did a surface job both with pictures and narratives. It left me wanting more, but not in a good way. Also, it probably should be called ""The Most Beautiful Garden STRUCTURES in the World"" -- because garden structures dominate the photographs. Criteria for choosing ""the most beautiful"" also unclear."
4,Perfect garden book for the coffee table,"Well-composed photos of mostly outstanding gardens in good light. Too many books have lesser quality photos because of the conditions when the photographer was visiting. Obviously a lot more time was spent waiting for decent light and the result is many really great photos. There is also a good balance of text; this is not the book for in depth info, but there is enough to give some background."
2,DISAPPOINTED!!!,"I love gardens. So, I was excited about receiving this book. The photos weren't as beautiful as I thought they would be. I wanted to return the book. I wish I had. I'm glad Amazon did not charge the list price of $60.00. I would have returned it for sure."
3,crammed full of information,"This is one heck of a book. I had to get it for a class in Knowledge Management.This is not an easy read. It was written for those who are already in the management profession and is definitely not ""dumbed down"" for the ignorant masses.But if you are sincerely want a comprehensive understanding this seems like a decent book."
1,:/ not cool,"I got this eraser. It was cheep, but the product itself was awesome, it erased well. The only problem is that, the title says box of 12, so thinking that, ill get 12 magic rubs, i thought, 'hey thats nice' so i bought it. But all it came was 1 piece, and i was really dissappointed.SO DONT LET THE SELLER TRICK YOU! >.>"
1,"This is not ""magic""","Our 7 year old son said it best ""just because they call it magic rub doesn't mean it erases like magic."". I was very disappointed in the quality. The erase on his Ticonderoga pencil was much better than magic rub. This left marks all over his worksheet. I would not recommend especially for the price."
2,Disappointing,"This is, not surprisingly, pleasant but hardly magnificent music. But it is interesting and superior to much of 18th century opera -- what an astounding genius Mozart was to compose such music even at such a tender age! However, this recording is disappointging. Whether it is the singer, or the engineer, I find Bastienne's (Dominik Orieschnig) singing harsh to the point of being unpleasant while Harrer's conducting is somewhat leaden."
1,Too Small...,"Tiny! These will not fit standard 3"" holes...purchased to replace current 3"" handles...these are almost an inch too small! Sending them back..."
4,not the best but good for the price,"I had a serious problem called propagation delay, something ive never heard before since I am novice in this technology field. Basicaly it means tha there is an anoying and confusing delay between your voice and the bakground music.The problem seems unsurmountable and after browsing all over the internet to no avail I was almost ready to give up until I fideled with a very simple solution, instead of buying a profesiona mixer.I connected the device directly to an amplifier instead of to the tv but left the video output directly to the tv and that took care of it.So that made a cheap device worth the money."
3,"Value for Money, Not high end","Just as other review, connected PC to TV, I got enough sound and echo. of course it cheap so don't expect a lot"
2,However...,"It's too early to tell if this product (Bayer 24-ounce ready-to-use etc) will kill the aphids on my rose bushes. Even if it does, it's not a good buy. I normally shy away from ready-to-use products, but I saw the spray bottle at a nursery and the label said it treats up to 35 medium sized plants, which would do me for a couple of months. Bayer lied, unless there's a caveat is in the words ""up to."" I managed to spray nine eighteen inch high roses with mainly new growth and not a lot of leaves. Well, maybe there's another caveat in the term ""medium."" I could have covered ten except the thing stopped spraying before it was empty. Anyway, a buck a plant. Like shooting aphids with silver bullets.So off I went to Walmart to buy the concentrate, which makes ten gallons. I finished the remaining nine roses plus a bush using only a pint of solution because the spray is much finer. Even if I had to buy both the product and a one gallon sprayer, I'd still be miles ahead."
4,"Handy, quick and easy","Easy for a new Bonsai enthusiast to go thru this and see how things are done. Pictures are wonderful, and information is easy to understand. Great size, too."
5,"Piano Concerto in A Minor, Op.16 by Grieg - Full Score","A well presented , easy to follow score. This is a must for any lover of this concerto. It is worth buying to appreciate both the simplicity and complexity of the piano part. Franz Liszt apparently played it at sight - how good was he! Great product - highly recommended."
3,Good Basic Score,"The score itself is very good, with the whole page taken up by the different instruments. The 9 1/2"" by 12"" size is generous and makes the score much easier to read than the ""minature series"". But other than a TOC and a description of the instrumentation that is mostly a translation of the Italian, there is nothing else to the book. That is except for a four page list of other scores from the publisher. Overall it is just what it says it is, sheet music."
5,"The real scoop on ""networking""","There are numerous books on ""networking,"" with titles like ""how to work a room."" The theme is to get lots of names of people that you can call when you want to sell them something.Wayne Baker is a respected researcher of social networks. This book gives a step-by-step method of analyzing one's own social networks and through them, learning more about oneself. These social networks are not groups of people that you socialize with, but rather the core people that make up your life, your family, your co-workers and others.Having diverse social networks is a good indicator of many metrics of success and happiness. People with diverse social networks make more money, get promoted faster, ... they even get fewer colds. But how diverse is your social network? How can you improve it? This book shows how to figure it out and teaches about social networks while doing it."
2,In like a lion out like a lamb,"After an interesting and thoughtful start in Chapter 1 - I found the rest of this work to be very light and not very useful.I read several other books in an effort to hone my corporate political skills in addition to this one, including 'NetWorlding' and 'PeopleSmart' before finding one that had the depth and subject treatment I was looking for. Check out 'The Secret Handshake' by Kathleen Kelley Reardon, Ph.D.that's my take - loopster - Chicago"
4,wok,"I am well pleased. It is heavy,durable and sturdy. Half the time you do not need to use the ladles, it shakes by hand really well."
4,"Simple, Easy to follow","I've taken a handful of yoga classes over the years, but wanted to get a DVD that was simple and traditional. This video is just that. Challenging but still not over my head. I like to think I'm somewhat athletic and flexible; some of the positions are too challenging, but i am able to do others. I look forward to getting into some of Richard's most challenging positions in this DVD as my practice improves."
1,Complete Dribble,What a shame as this volume could have been well written or at least of historical importance.Dribble from start to finish.A total waste of a reader's time.
2,XP Good. XP Books Waste of Money,There is no information in this book that is not available for free on the web. The only reason to buy this book is to give something back to the authors for their contributions to the XP community.
4,GOOD,"XP is a nice fresh way of looking at the software development process and this book explains XP concisely and clearly. You may or may not agree to -all- of the principles they advocate, but if you have any interest in your work at all, you will find parts of this gripping. Especially the emphasis on unit tests and the test-first programming idea. And so useful in practice too! Anyone involved with making software, or indeed anyone else who is interested in increasing the quality of what you're working on whatever it is, should read this! So better borrow it from your neighbour (reading once is sufficient, no need to own this book)."
3,Great introductory and concise book but lacks serious detail,The book covers electrical concepts right from the basics of resistors and capacitors and then moves on to the fundamentals of electronic circuits . The coverage of mdifferent types of motors is lacking in the mathematical and design approach although it does cover the theoretical aspects well . Overall an ideal book for beginners but look for another one if you really want some details.
3,Sometimes smokin',"Some exciting action set pieces help weak story of a female Interpol agent who is trying to find a supermodel/thief who is on the run from her own problems. Padded, with dopey Filipino cab driver sidekicks, but good enough action to recommend."
3,OK ACTION FILM,"Cynthia Khan stars in this cheap Hong Kong Production.Insane plot,but great fun.especially if your a fan of this type of film.Nice print quality Full Screen, only missing a tiny bit of both sides."
2,too bad :(,"While the female lead is extremely attractive, the movie as a whole is ugly! The plot, to recover a stolen relic, is so uninteresting & unimportant that I almost fell asleep. The fighting is sparse & the bad editing makes the occasional fight scene a visual disaster. Uneventful, uninteresting & disastrous. I wanted to dip my DVD player into boiling water after running this flick."
1,A sad attempt,I thought this movie was by far the nothing more than an utter bore fest. If you have trouble sleeping try this DVD half way through I guarantee sleeping will no-longer be your affliction. Oh and the costumes were so dated that I thought Muscle shirts were in style again. I hope this helps in sorting through the really bad Hong Kong Joints. Note: Mad fake action and poor acting its great comb if you like being ripped off. Learn from my mistake! PLease!
5,Where Can I Find Another One?,"This is a great product! I own two, one for teeth and one for nasal irrigation. I bought a bulky plug in water pick that about blew out my nasal passages and washed out my brain(!), even on the lowest setting. I was looking for something less bulky and with less force. This is perfect for home or travel dental care, and a gentler touch if you have to do nasal irrigation. I would like to purchase another for back up in case either of my others wear out, but haven't seen it in the store or on Amazon lately."
2,conairs portable oral irrigator,"The batteries wear out fast. The tips keep falling out of the holder. If you don't need a portable, I would not recommend it. I got two blue tips"
3,Bread pan,I love the handles and the way the bread browns but I don't like that the sides don't go straight up and the pan is slightly over sized. My bread turns out a funny shape. I won't be using this pan regularly. It will be back up.
5,Great loaf pan!,I like the finish on this bread pan. It is not too light and not too dark. It has an easy to use non-stick finish.
5,Great Non-stick Pan!,"I purchased one of these for home baking to replace an older pan which was not non-stick. I use it to make whole grain loaves, or dessert breads like banana bread or zucchini bread. With these pans I just use a quick burst of cooking spray to prep the pan. When baking is done, the contents always slide out easily. Cleaning the pan after use is also easier. This is quicker and a lower fat alternative to prep with shortening or butter in my old regular pans so I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Good so far,"Only used it once but it works rather well. Was going to get a different one but this one had good reviews and it didn't let me down. I'm thinking I""m going to get another one just so I don't have to keep halving recipes."
4,"Sturdy, Reliable","Bought it recently so I can not attest to its overall durability, but I tend to agree with other reviewers about this product. Used it for home made bread, banana nut and fruit cakes and it has worked beautifully. 4 Stars is above average and in a year, after knowing if it lasts with the non stick, then certainly might deserve higher marks. For now a fine addition to any modern kitchen."
1,Worst Baking Sheet I've Purchased,"I purchased this baking sheet in the late Fall of 2010. It's already due for the garbage can. I've never owned a stickier ""non-stick"" baking pan. It performed well for about 4 weeks and then things started to get progressively worse. By now, I must literally scrub it with an abrasive sponge in order to get food off of it when I use it. Simple things like tilapia are sticking to it. Additionally, it's developed some really unsightly brown stains that simply will not come off. I can not recommend this product, nor would I ever consider purchasing another one from this manufacturer. If you're use to buying a baking sheet and keeping it for a long time, then keep shopping."
3,Will they hold up?,"These are extremely non-stick and have worked well, but there are a few drawbacks that make me question their longevity.First time I used them my pot holders (red and blue) stained them. Not sure what that means about the coating holding up in the long run.One of them has a crease/kink/bend forming on the right edge that gets worse with each use. The sheet is starting to crown in the middle as a result and anything that can roll, will. Not a problem for cookie dough as I just push down a bit when placing the glob, but it tends to be an issue with egg rolls/mozz sticks and other rounded items.Also, these are handwash only and will not fit in most double bowl kitchen sinks. Maybe that's a no brainer, but definitely something to consider. I have Airbake cookie sheets that are dishwasher safe and have held up for 10 years now. Bought these so I could stop buying parchment paper, but I might have to stick with what I know works."
3,"OK, but warped on first use","This cookie sheet is nice and heavy, so I thought it wouldn't warp easily (also because the description says that it resists warping), but alas, it warped on the very first use. My search for the non-warping cookie sheet continues!"
2,Warp Factor 5...Captain!,"I was looking for two things: A cookie sheet that wouldn't warp, and would clean easily.Unfortunately, the reviews fooled me, and this Farberware cookie sheet failed on both accounts.My mistake for not doing more research. Presently looking into a Circulon replacement.Purchased a Circulon stir fry pan with nonstick over a year ago, and it's FANTASTIC!Nothing sticks to it, and I can clean dried eggs off it, with one wipe of a wet sponge!"
3,Not what I expected,I ordered the book thinking it would have more history of quarrying in Indiana but it was about modern day folks that have worked with stone. Great pictures though.
5,Interesting and diverse stories from Indiana limestone workers,"I bought this book because my grandfather was one of the limestone workers interviewed, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading all of the stories it contained. Growing up in Oolitic you could not help but be surrounded by the stories of those who worked in the limestone mills and it was great to see them put together so well. Ms. Ferrucci did a fabulous job in compiling this book."
1,not black,"These marbles should not be described as black at all.Though in the picture they may look black, the only way you'll see them as black in person is if you turn off all the lights.These marbles are gunmetal silver. If i wanted silver marbles, I would have looked for some, however, after spending 8+ dollars for 100 marbles that are NOT the color they are labeled, I am extremely disappointed."
3,Shipping needs improvement.,"There is a previous review on this item referencing a loss during shipping. The product itself is in ok shape, but the packaging was severely damaged and there are small glass shards at the bottom of the shipping 'bag' like some of the marbles have chipped. We're using these for center pieces at our wedding, so hopefully none are damaged."
5,Good marble source,I bought 6 bags of marbles for some games we were making. The marbles are good quality and as described. There was a loss during shipping due to poor packing but the company promptly sent replacements. Overall I was very satisfied.
3,It bugs me!!!!!!!!,"It may be a good product I'm not sure,Because every time I install it on my handspring prism i get a Fatel error.There support is not to great!I keep getting the run around.They say to get the newest version.I did it did not help.I ask for a refund.they told me to take it Back to store of purchase.The store will not give me my money back because its opened.and,I guess they won't either."
2,Not too impressed,"I bought this right after I bought my Palm Pilot Vx. It works great but for as much money I spent on it I expected more. It's set up okay just not too handy when I'm looking for something, I might as well use my memo pad instead."
5,very funny and good acting,this movie brought back fond memories og my youth. my granddaughter who is 9 like this type of movie because she like the fact the undedog (mouse) outsmarts the cat.
5,Fine Recording of a Masterpiece,"This is an excellent recording of this great opera. Fine singing and excellent conducting. While not a substitute for seeing a performance, this recording is an excellent way to experience the music."
5,awesome,"this to me is the best opera ever written, there are aspects of drama, comedy, etc. it is to hear, and takes your breath away, i strongly recommend this recording. the whole cast is awesome. buy this recording"
3,Gak Sato - Post-Echo,"Gak Sato's Post-Echo album walks down those jazzy, loungey avenues that have been previously explored by others, but this own wanderings are nonetheless worthwhile. There's certainly plenty of swinging going on in these tracks, from the energetic breaks of ""The Man (Whereabouts Be Unknown)"" to the lighter rhythms and funk guitar of ""Youp!"" ""Post-Echo"" obviously partakes in dub-style reverbs, while ""Theme From UFO (Ready to Launch Version)"" takes the old TV show tune and modernizes it. ""The Sonic Dream"" is as blissful as all get-out (despite the wolf howls and darkness towards the end), and the Kid Loco mix of ""Penetrare"" is mellowed jazz in classic Kid Loco style. The album as a fun listen -- a worthy addition to any lounge lizard's set."
2,Just a bootleg record,"If you love Robert Wyatt and own all possible records from Canterbury Tales, Soft Machine than I suggest to buy this one. Otherwise if you are not a collector then pass your way. Recording is such poor quality ...My suggestion would be rather to convert Matchine Mole or especially Soft Machine LPs to remaster (with bonus) cds instead"
3,Only 143,"The description specifies that I'd receive 144, but, I counted, and there are 143. Why 'only' 143 erasers? Do you thought anybody would count? What a shame... But it erases pretty well."
5,Don't waste your money on other erasers!,"Seriously, if you're looking for pencil erasers, these are the absolute best. My oldest son is in 6th grade and over the years, I have bought various pencil-top erasers--none of them ever stayed on--until I bought these Paper Mate erasers. I'm pretty sure that the box of 144 will last all 3 of my kids until they graduate high school, but that's ok. I would absolutely buy these again and I'm sorry I wasted my money on other brands."
5,"Like my daughter says, these things actually work!","Is it possible to get excited about erasers? Yes, it is! I love these because they actually stay on the pencil end! They are tough and durable and they just plain work."
4,Grat price for a good product.,Love the amount you get and the price you pay. These erasers last and work well.
5,Awesome!,"This was more erasers than I was thinking of, and it was great for the price! I love them, and they work fantastically."
4,Great Value,"I bought these for my 3rd and 4th graders. They work great. Thick enough ""rim"" so it doesn't split when you use it. Such a great price for so many erasers! I definitely recommend"
5,Great erasers!,I knew there must be some good quality pencil erasers out there somewhere. I was glad when I ran across these with the good reviews and wanted to agree. They're great!
5,Excellent quality,These erasers don't crack or leave a black smudge like so many do. Very pleased with the product. Have enough to last a lifetime. Will have to give some to a teacher I know. (-:
3,Guitar Christmas,"By Jeffrey W. Bennett Author of Under the Lontar Palm and founder of LayMentor...I bought this book to learn the screaming guitar solos. What a way to go for christmas. Exciting and dramatic. However, not all guitar pieces are transcribed in tabular format. This book is best played by sight readers."
5,Fantastic Christmas Music for your Piano,Love the Trans-Siberian Orchestra! And this collection of Christmas music is awesome! Fun to play on your own piano! Great arrangements of classic music modified with rock!
1,This review is for the KINDLE version....,"Awful. Absolutely awful. It looks like someone scanned this to a PDF file (at a low resolution) and is passing it off as the ""official"" Kindle version. The score is not black, it is grey and it is not sharp when zoomed in. Each page is set at about 60% of actual size, so there is more white than print. You cannot see the score clearly when displayed on an iPad in a music stand - way too small.Notice how you cannot preview this in Amazon - it is awful!!! I wish I could provide a picture, but that would break all sorts of copyright laws.I am going to request a refund and purchase the print version. I am very disappointed with this version.As for the contents, from what I saw it looks reliable and accurate."
5,Has worked as advertised for over a year,"Came well packaged, installed easily, had all the parts I needed and has worked without incident for over a year now. I just got a new (old) car and I plan to buy another one of these since fixed antenna tend to get torn off.Recommended without reservation."
4,conveys the rudiments to a reader with short attention span,"The treatment in the book is directed at getting high schoolers to learn useful computer skills. As opposed perhaps to playing games or downloading music.It teaches the student the basics of several of the packages in the Microsoft Office suite. Word, for typing and editing essays. PowerPoint for presenting stuff at meetings. Excel for spreadsheets. These are now seen as basic computer literacy skills.The approach may seem forced to some readers. The brightly coloured pages and screen shots are meant to captivate the reader. Clearly aimed at a reader with a limited attention span. But students for which this is not an issue might want a more detailed text."
3,Not the real ballet!,"This mediocre recording of LA BAYADERE is quite different from the traditional performances in Russia. It's even more different from the Kirov's reconstruction of the performance score for the 1900 production. John Lanchberry has stated time and time again in interviews that he doesn't like the music of Minkus and it shows in his arrangement of the score. Some of the ballet's loveliest music is cut (although I think I read that Markarova,who staged the version for which Lanchberry revised the score, is responsible for that), his interpolations in the score (such as most of the third act)are dreadful, and the orchestrations are heavy-handed, pretentious, and far too modern-sounding for 1877. Supposedly the Kirov Ballet Orchestra is coming out with a cd based on the 1900 revival. For those of us who love 19th century ballet music, let's hope so. I only gave the recording 3 instead of 2 stars since some of Minkus' sparkling score survive the butchery."
2,"No ""Dance Manu"" ...And too expensive for an incomplete recording","I don't have much to add to the previous reviewers who gave this CD low rating. Quite a few music pieces are missing, including some of the best ones like ""Dance Manu"" and the lively part of Nikia's dance before she is bitten by the snake (not sure what a proper name for it). For such overpriced album you would expect it to be a complete ballet with some extras. Pieces that did make it to this CD are beautiful, no questions."
5,great!,I felt this was the most comprehensive version of this book. It is easy to see where the different sources come from. I found it very informative.
5,Fantastic Pan,Just got my pans today. Already baked some MorningGlory Muffins that taste over the top. The pan is everything everyone said it would be. Muffins just slid right out the pan.
1,Black bottoms,"Thought this would be a great pan, but am very unhappy with it. Even when using a liner, the bottom of the cupcakes or muffins are always burned no matter what temperature it is baked at. Have gone back to using a very old pan that may not be non-stick, but at least it bakes, not burns. Don't waste your money."
1,I don't know what I am missing....,"I don't know what I am missing, but I can't stand these pans. I used them twice for cupcakes and I did not like them at all. I felt like they conducted too much heat and cooked the outsides a bit too much than other pans. Plus if you want to make your cupcakes/muffins a little bigger, then just spread out into a funny shape instead of rising like a dome. I recommend the Calphalon Classic pans. They are more expensive but much better in my opinion."
5,Best Muffin Pan I've Ever Used,"This is literally the best muffin pan I've ever used, and I have used several types, including other nonstick pans, plain aluminum pans, and silicone.1) It is very heavy duty, literally 3 times the weight of the muffin pans I used previously. It's not going to warp and lose its shape!2) Very easy to clean. If cleaned shortly after the muffins come out, just wipe clean with a wet sponge. No soaking or scrubbing necessary!3) The muffins are standard sized. A recipe that is supposed to make 12 muffins will make 12 muffins. This may not sound like a big deal, but my previous pans always made 14 or so! And there is variation in the dimensions of muffin holes in ""standard"" pans.I'm planning on going back and ordering another 1 or 2 of these, and then pitching my old ones. If you're in the market for standard-size muffin tins, buy these!"
4,Great quality great value,"Overall a great product. Very heavy duty and obviously quality made. My only complaint that I took one star off for was because the cups are a seperate piece of metal that appears to be welded on or somehow attached to the top. This leaves a very small gap on the inside of the pan where the cups meet the top surface, you can sort of see this in the blow up picture, I can see residue building up in this area over time if not cleaned well after use. The positive is that the material of this pan is extremely easy to clean making dealing with this problem pretty easy, you just have to do it, no leaving it on the counter for a week for stuff to fully harden into the small gap."
5,Very good bakeware,"It is so nice making muffins that don't stick to the pan, this is very nice bakeware,"
4,Great cupcakes,"My cupcakes have never been as even, all the way golden as now.I really recommend it."
5,Great pan,"It's a nonstick muffin pan. Exactly as advertised. The wife and I have made muffins, cupcakes, brownies, even mini frittatas in this thing. I didn't use any spray or liners because I just wanted to torture the thing. This pan took it all in stride. To be honest, it's pretty hard to just keep whatever you cook in the pan because it just wants to pop out. If you're looking for a muffin pan, stop looking and do yourself a favor and get this pan."
5,Great for paper baking cups,I purchased this pan because the bottom diameter looked large enough to accommodate paper baking cups-- my old pan was too small at the bottom and the liners would fold up on themselves. This one works great! It is also deeper than my other one.
5,A very nice muffin pan.,"It is heavy and bakes evenly, the most important quality in any bakeware. As I use paper muffin cups I cannot attest to the nonstick capabilities but just judging by the feel of the finish, I would be willing to bet that baked goods would pop right out. If I ever get around to forgoing the paper cups, I'll come back and report on the results. As I live in a rural area, this pan is by far a better quality product than I can buy locally and the price plus the free shipping made it a no brainer to purchase from Amazon."
2,It was very good but it became sticky very soon,"I bought 2 pans. They were great at start. All muffins came off easily and neatly. I had thought they were the best muffin pans in the world. But soon, after 5-10 times uses, they became very sticky, and completely different from what they were. I had been using warm/hot water and dish detergent and hand washing them, and never used nonsticky spray on them as instructed, so I couldn't figure out what was the problem. No scratches, and there may be a very thin layer of grease. Was this the problem? I wonder whether the other buyers had the same issues after using them a few times."
5,"sturdy, light-weight, really great!","This is actually my first muffin pan (I've been using a mini cupcake pan all these years) and it's great! I have other Farberware products (pots & pans) so I went with their muffin pan. Since it arrived, I've only used it once to make mini cheesecakes, and they came out wonderfully! The handles are really convenient =)I bought this on Jan. 27, 2012 for $10.74+prime"
5,Love Farberware Bakeware,"I have several pieces of nonstick Farberware bakeware and I love them all. The heat evenly, don't warp, don't rust and clean up easily. I highly recommend any out of this line."
5,Great classical music,We watched his concerts on PBS and enjoy his music so we bought the CD. Lively music!
4,Doesn't gum up the paper,"These erasers, look like any other pencil eraser, but perform much better. Most erasers I have used tend to leave a gummy residue on the paper, but these do not. they seem to be firmer, and when erasing, only the amount of material that is needed rubs off the eraser. The part of the eraser that rubs off is dry and flaky, and can be easily brushed away. These erasers also do the best job at removing even the darkest marks."
4,"Ok, but cheapie white ones beat up the paper less","All in all this is a good eraser. But for almost no $$, you can get a no-name white eraser (Mine is from the dollar store---""FLOMO ER-T20 pvc free, latex free"") which does as good a job but leaves more fibers intact in the page where it belongs.Odd too, because I remember from college that the Staedtler Mars were The Freaking Best One To Get, but the cheapie white ones I got are better. Note: Not all cheapie ones are as good. Some of the ""ICE"" style clear-ish ones don't work well.I have a drawer full of erasers now of varying ability. My kids like to erase pages of drawings at a time. LOL"
1,Very good quality eraser but very expensive.,"I ordered this eraser from Amazon and received on time.The quality is perfect. However, when I went to buy some other items from ""Staples"", the same product with the same brand and quantity , was just $2.00. That means I paid more than 100% for same product ."
4,A little dry,Maybe dry's not the right word...They aren't soft and supple like the Hi Polymer ones. I still use them but they are crumblier and do a very slightly worse job at complete erasure than the other brand. They are decent though.
3,Too hard,"I don't understand why this eraser is so famous . For me, it's too hard and aggressive with the paper. Instead of this, I recommend the Vinyl Faber Castell. This is softer, more effective, and less aggressive with the paper. The Faber Castell is better by far than the Mars Plastic Staedtler. By far."
4,I was sorry to see the book end!,"Kimberly Ripley did a wonderful job in ""Lily's Gift."" I found myself getting involved in Lily's life. The sadness of having no father image in her life with an indifferent mother caused her to need her""Gram"" even more. I was caught up in Lily's life, especially the teaching from her""Gram."" I was sorry to have the book end! Am looking forward to the next edition. Datha Beck Darby"
3,NOT QUITE CORRECT,SEAMS GOING TO HAVE TO DRILL OUT THIS SISSY BAR TO GETPROPER HIGHT FOR SEAT YES ITS 36 INCH BAR BUT THE MOUNTING HOLES ARE 19 INCHES AT BEST GOOD FOR A KIDBUT NOT GOOD FOR A COSTOM BIKE FOR A ADULT
1,item is not as advertised,Item is not as advertised. The sissy bar they sent me does not look like the one advertised. This is actually a high back sissy bar when I ordered the one in the picture.The seller is very hard to contact. Now Im stuck with the totally wrong sissy bar.
4,"despite beautiful singing, it misses the opera's elegance","The overture is poorly done on this recording and it gives us a clue as to what is wrong. Despite the exceptional cast and beautiful singing throughout, the opera's classical qualities and Italianate character are somewhat missed partly due to the lack of Italian singers and partly due to the lack of elegance in the orchestral accompaniment. Leporello's character is excellent. He completely captures the complicity of his character and, unlike the other singers, pronounces the Italian lyrics properly which makes the music more beautiful and elegant. There is also something wrong with the 1991 remastered sound that just doesn't compete with the remastered analogue recordings that are possible with today's technology."
5,"""madamemusico"" is right except the Karajan",The Karajan/Tomowa-Sintow version was produced about 20 years earlier than the reviewer alleges.
4,"Good, but not great like...","...the true studio albums. As stated above, these songs were recorded over a period of time, and it kind of shows. There are some great songs here, but it lacks the cohesion and production of Lillian Axe's 5 star albums: Love And War, Poetic Justice and Psychoschizophrenia. The dubut album; Lillian Axe gets 4 stars. I do highly reccommend this one, but do what you can to find the rest of their out of print catalogue."
1,easily the worst album of their discography,"I am a very commited Lillian Axe fan, but this album should have been left in the past. I see why it is an album of songs that didn't make on the other ones. The production is very raw and the tracks sound like they were just thrown together. Don't buy it!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Doctor heads into space with Sarah Jane Smith, and is also accompanied by Harry Sullivan, a doctor who works with UNIT.What they find is a space station of sorts, and it at first appears to be deserted. That is, until the find the large monstrous alien, and the humans in suspended animation.Many frozen dinners to be had."
1,Painting Flowers and Gardens in Watercolor and Pastel,This is one of the worst art books I have ever purchased. I thought it would be a mixed medium method or a way to combine watercolor and pastels. Each medium was handled separately. The pastel portion was a disgrace. It was very childlike. I am a pastel and watercolorist. Any other book on beginning pastel would be better. The watercolor would be informative to anyone who new nothing about watercolor. Shame on the publisher for allowing this book to even use the word pastel. I feel I was robbed.
2,Overwrought and false,"The language may be poetic but it is totally overdone. I can't believe that these characters would really speak like that. And Bowlyn and Nance have an affair! Give me a break. I am sure that in post-civil war America a middle class white woman and a recently freed slave would have sex. She never would and poor Bowlyn would have lynch mob on his mind more than sex. I don't know who this Gibson woman is, but I got a feeling that she ain't black. This scene is just too false."
2,"nice revisit, tin the end too preachy & simplistic","Interesting to see Flynn back after all these years.. definately a more seasoned MacDonald, but not his best. I would think Wise Saws to finish off the time compendeum novels might be better, but last i checked that was onoy available in e-book, for a high price. This novel brought back favorite characters, but ended up being a bit too didactic (preachy). Buck passes Flynn was my fave, along with the original Flynn, and then of cause the intro to Flynn in Confess Fletch. Flynn's Inn being the most contrived..and hardly worth the print in my estimation.. no.. if you want more Macdonald.. i actually think he was at his best in his early days.. find some of the earlier prints, than this.. Safekeeping.. M.E. Love among the Mashed Potatoes.."
1,More a Political Tract Than a Mystery,"Unfortunately, this book is basically a political tract and not any kind of mystery. Even worse, the politics presented just reinforce my belief in how miserable this world is due to PC. To add insult to injury, the mysteries Flynn is trying to solve are trivial (essentially there for McDonald to wrap his politics around) and Flynn's wry attitude are taken to such an extreme that they go right past ""two-dimensional"" and into ""one-dimensional"" (i.e., the characterization are worse than flat). I suppose if you're a die-hard Flynn fan, you'll want to read this. But otherwise, I'd suggest staying far away: it's just too depressing to read."
5,Great Historical book,Great history on not only Wells Fargo but the early growing west. Very well written.
2,I hate to give a bad review...,but this book is just not good. Disjointed to say the least. Is well researched but dont call your book Stagecoach and then 3 chapters in flip to a history of the bank.Ugggh so disappointed.
5,Great for the backyard,I got this mound so my daughter can practice in the back yard. It comes with 3 screw in nails so it can be inserted in the ground securely. I had it for a few months now and it's holdiing up pretty well. I would recommend this product for backyard and practice use.
5,Secondhand World a First-Rate Read,"Read it for the flawless sentences or the unexpected turns: a coming-of-age novel in which loss is more than the vanity of innocence, a familial and cultural clash whose darker side inexorably turns into the light and the reader's full view, a first-person point-of-view that conveys the stuff of a world as well as an individual consciousness, a look at how American life is so richly imagined and so blankly played out, including wonderful coming-of-sexual age road trip that combines Henry Millerian exuberance with Nabokovian irony. The four main characters - the teenage Korean-American heroine, her immigrant parents, and her not-quite-blind boyfriend - deepen and come more alive on the page the more pages you turn. This is a deftly put-together novel that makes good on its promise and then some."
3,ok....,"This is ok...the highlight is nirvanas dive, which yes i beleive is a good song, i dont care what anyone else says, and if you sayd that i only like it because kurt cobain did, your wrong, like the person who wrote ""epitome of an era""....it was big becfause nirvana was good, and this song was good, Just because kurt did it, doesnt mean it was a huge hit, it was good, if any other band did it, i would still like it. Nirvana was probally the best gruge band, they brought grunge up, gruge isnt anything anymore though, just history."
1,"Great for those intended, sucks for the rest of us","I bought this CD years ago for the L7 and Babes in Toyland tracks. Everyone else bought it for Nirvana, I'm sure that's why SUB POP put them on the CD. If you're still listening to this stuff 10+ years later, good for you, you'll probably enjoy it. If you've matured past the ""oh boo hoo, life brings me down so I'm gonna whine about it"" then you're gonna hate the CD."
1,epitome of an era...,"an era that sucked like no other (with the notable exception of late 70s disco)...once upon a time rock was cool, musicians were actually able to play their instruments, songs had melodies/lines/hooks/riffs, you could count on the lead guitarist (yep, once upon a time such an animal did exist) to explode into a frenetic solo, and then along came grunge...slow, droning tuned down guitars played by talentless clowns with whining, ""woe is me"" lyrics mumbled in a nasally, petulant poseur-boy over the top manner...with political correctness added for the b-o-r-e-d-o-m quotient.grunge quickly died a well-deserved death, and the result of the killing of rock/metal has been britney, christina, justin, and other overpromotoed mouseketeers...all thanks to kurt, eddie v., and the gang from seattle...way to go, guys."
3,In Your Face Sci-Fi,"A distant planet, a virus that drives you mad and a cloud that brings mutilated, decaying corpses back to life what more could you ask for. Oh, a little romance too. This campy thriller keeps the action rolling. One of the few books I have read that makes me close my eyes before I turn the next page. The dialogue can be a bit too machismo at times. But the gore is great! I am looking forward to this authors future blood soaked adventures."
1,Bland and Boring,The author of this book tried to make conflicted heroes. He ended up making them all so obnoxious I wanted the zombies to get them; which isn't much of a punishment because the zombies were boring.
5,Great Read,"I read this book in three days on a business trip to San Francisco. I really enjoy Sci-Fi movies, so this was an easy read.I thought the character developement was superb. I felt like I knew the characters, both what they looked like and how they felt in certain situations.I also thought the intimacy between male/female characters was great. In the first encounter between two characters, Vince stopped before really getting very far along in the love-making. I felt this was an excellent way to create anticipation for the second erotic encounter between two entirely different characters. A great book"
5,Action packed,"Once I delved into this futuristic space thriller, I was emmersed in the action. The ride was both scary and scenic. How could you not like Gale- the ultra-hero and his diverse group of mercinaries. The ending is twisty and unfair to people who like predictability. Can't wait for the next adventure ride."
4,"Intense, vivid, captivating","There's nothing better than a book that won't let you put it down until the last page is read! The author is relentless in his determination to hold you from beginning to end. Graphically well written. The scenes vividly play out on the big screen of the imagination as if you are watching the panic and terror from the shadows. It's a futuristic horror/thriller that will leave you wondering, ""could this really happen?""This is a book I will read again, just for the thrill of it!"
4,THE DEAD SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SCI-FI NOVELS THAT I HAVE READ IN ALONG TIME. IT HAD ME ON THE EDGE OF MY CHAIR THOUGH THE WHOLE BOOK. A GREAT AND EASY READ. CAN'T WAIT FOR HIS NEXT ONE. I'M GIVE THE BOOK I BOUGHT TO A FRIEND SO HE CAN READ IT TO. A MUST READ TOM ANDERSON
1,this one sucks,"sorry vince. It's not that I think this guy can't write but I was hopeing that this zombie book would have some zombies in it. First off, the one quick part in the beginning that had zombies kind of soured me right away. (the undead were talking, takeing peoples ears and making trophie necklaces out of them and just being downright spiteful) I'm all for making a story your own but zombies are mindless killers, that is what makes them so cool. I'm about half through (still no zombie action) and I hit a graphic sex scene... Sorry but I aint gonna finish this one..If I was looking for that, I got plenty downloaded. Here's a hint, zombie fans want blood, guts, horror and creative death scenes, if we wanted this kind of faggyness we would read vampire novels."
3,"Some good, some bad","I received this book directly from the author, who's on-line diary I have been reading for some time. I found the story to be interesting, but felt the language to be under developed and repetitive. I did enjoy some of the characters, however. It's a pretty heavy sci-fi/horror/thriller read, so I would advise anyone who is at all squeamish to pass on this one."
4,Imagine 28 DAYS LATER meets ALIENS,"This debut by Vince Churchill combines elements of the above films and impales them together for a giddily gruesome, supercharged action/horror novel. A team of potent mercenaries are hired on a mission that ends up with them against a society of virus-infected people acting on their most violent, vile actions. Matters only worsen when the killed are resurrected as zombies. While the storytelling does sometimes played fast-and-loose to cater to the plotting, this is nevertheless a fast-paced, rousing read with plenty of scares and suspense. In particular, the author thrives with occasional glimpses into the debauched acts of the crazed. A flashback to the grotesque, prolonged death of a former crew member is also quite memorable. After completing DEAD, I look forward to reading Churchill's latest novel, THE BLACKEST HEART."
5,great buy,"I purchased these because they are made by crayola.Their crayons are true to color,not like other brands where the color is off.My grandkids will get alot of use out of these crayons and will enjoy coloring and creating with them.I would recommend this product to others."
4,Amazing Upgrade,"Well, I have the first iteration of iWork and I must say that I am extremely pleased that I upgraded. Pages is vastly improved and I love fooling around in Numbers. If you purchased iWork 06, I am not sure if this is a worthy upgrade. If you purchased the original iWork and did not upgrade to 06, this is definitely worth it. Besides, I got the Family Pack with 5 installs for a great price here on Amazon. Go for it, you won't regret it!!!"
4,Solid Product,"iWork has been improved greatly. While the spreadsheet module is not going to knock Excel out of the box, it is a good solid program. The real gems are Pages and Keynote. Pages has been improved nicely and I feel is a lot easier to use than Word when it comes to doing things like newsletters and other items with graphics. Anyone wanting a nice easy program for doing a newsletter should consider this bundle for that alone. What can I say about Keynote other than it is better than Powerpoint on many fronts. If you want the best presentation program on the market, get keynote along with a very value packed bundle in iWork."
1,Why no upgrade path?,"Having just purchased iWork 06 a couple of months ago, I'm disappointed that I'm being asked for another $99 to upgrade to iWork 08, even though I've already purchased much of its functionality in Version ""06"". I'm surprised and saddened that Apple is showing Microsoft-like greed in not allowing people who just purchased the previous version a discount on Version ""08""."
3,Works fine,It works ok. I was able to install it to my computers without any problems. I saved some money by buying this old version. It works for me.
4,iwork works,"Great software for the price, but sure wish I had known the new version was coming out the following month! Upgrade is the same as buying the original. I write articles for magazines and I have to be careful about how I save my documents as they will not read on a PC unless they are exported as a word document so keep this in mind. However, this software is made for a Mac and works great as it integrates with existing software and makes your workflow a lot easier. Love the templates in Ink which are perfect for business and client letters and invoices."
4,"It's a great progam, but transitioning over may take a little time","Great product for basic users ... easy to use, but may take a little time to get used to if you're used to using Word or Excel. Keynote is WAY better for slide shows than the microsoft version!"
4,Very functional for price,Covers much more than the basics for a low cost. There is a learning curve moving from other products. Let's hope Apple can keep these productivity products updated and avoid dumping them in the future.
4,Numbers is the best,"I have not yet used Keynote in iWork '08, that is why I rated this product a four. However, without it I would rate it a five. Especially Numbers... absolutely LOVE it!!! I can make tables in seconds! So easy! Much easier than excel, but if you have experience with excel then you will for sure think Numbers is a breeze! Leave it to Apple to create things a little more simpler!"
3,worked great for my diaper cake bath theme,"I purchased this toy to use on a diaper cake i made for a friend. The cake was a hit. The toys are so colorful and fun. The only issue I have is that the net and the 123 fish have proven not to hold up. I purchased them separate for my son and i found the polka dots on the end of the net faded fast, and the paint actually peeled off the fish and into my baby's mouth, i consequently had to throw the fish away."
3,Slightly different than what I was expecting,"I have not put this set to use yet, but I received three toys that were different than those in the picture. I received 2 different rubber toys that indicate when the water is hot as well as an octopus instead of a crab. I primarily ordered this set for the fish n net and the stacking cups, so I am not too terribly disapointed."
2,Will not buy Sassy products again.,"I only have the turtle and the fishing net.Turtle: The turtle was used for about 5 months while my nephew stayed with me and then was put up until my new baby would be able to use it. I dryed out all of the bath toys and they were stored in an open air toy bin for about 6 months. I finally felt my daughter was ready for toys in the bath and put the turtle in the water and noticed black stuff floating in the water. There was mold/mildew growing inside of the turtle. I tried washing it with bleach water, but more kept coming out even after repeated washings. I finally just gave up and threw it out. I had several other squirt toys stored with the turtle and none of them had the same problem.Fish net: The paint on the fish net is peeling off after only 5 months use. The fish themselves are fine."
4,"Sturdy, Bakes too hot","The metal is very sturdy and the non stick finish is great. However, cut down on the baking time and temperature a bit since it bakes hotter than my old aluminum pans."
5,Spontaneous is Diana Wagman's Second Winner,"In both Skin Deep, her first novel, and Spontaneous, her newest one, Diana Wagman has created believable yet unconventional characters whose worlds present them with fascinating dilemmas. The amazing triangle of the sisters, Amy and Gwendolyn, and Roosevelt, the more than handy handyman revolves around the possibilities of combustions of all sorts. I found myself hooked from the beginning and enjoyed every twist and turn of this original plot. Jean Stafford comes to mind when I think of the pleasure in reading about characters and situations which are offbeat and engaging."
1,"Wow, is this book BAD!","This was quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. From the 1st paragraph on the first page, all the way to the last sentance. Horrible subject matter, bad writing and a hard to follow story line. Don't waste your money or your time!"
4,Understanding Austria and Germany,"My understanding of my German parents and grandparents and their attitudes toward the European Jews has always been an enigma for me. Sam Apple has the same desires of knowledge that I have, the same questions. Did I receive any any answers? Not really, but life and books are about moving to the truth, and learning about mankind as we go along."
3,Spot-on social observations from an adolescent personality,"""Schlepping Through the Alps"" opens a fascinating window for Americans into the little-discussed world of Austria's internal politics. Unfortunately, the view is clouded by Sam Apple's insistence on foisting descriptions on the reader of his neuroses, his sexual adventures with a ""hip"" Austrian woman, and the banal details of the protagonist's dysfunctional family. Woody Allen worked comic wonders with the neurotic secular Jewish character, but that persona lost its freshness nearly 30 years ago. If a reader may offer advice to Mr. Apple for his next book, it would be to share more of the results of his impressive interviewing and observation skills, and to keep his private life private."
3,Printing Web Pages,"If you are seriously considering purchasing this book, you should be aware that aside from some typical publisher's mumbo jumbo up front, this is a hardcopy format of the online MySQL Documentation already available via the web. The language of THAT work has always been a little tortured; but once you spend some time with it, it does get the point across.I don't want to imply this book is without value - it isn't. If nothing else, the covenience of having it in this format is worth something - I'm just not sure $40 is the right number."
2,"Seems like it would work, but it doesn't...","I wore a strapless beaded cocktail dress (lined with satin) to a wedding and hoped this fashion tape would help keep the dress up. Unfortunately, I got through almost half the tin in one night...and it still didn't work at holding up the dress. It didn't damage the fabric, so that a positive. It did leave a sticky residue on my skin that hurt to peel off. I do not think I'd recommend this product to a friend, but maybe it would work for a much lighter job."
1,Didn't Work for Me,"I bought these to try to eliminate gaping in a sundress I wore for a recent wedding. Thankfully, I also took a package of safety pins with me, because while these adhered well to both my skin and my bra, they didn't adhere to my dress at all."
2,"Didn't work for me, either :-(","I sometimes use VERY small and soft shoulder pads under a couple of sweaters and thought this would be just the thing to hold them in place--wrong. All the adhesive on the side next to my skin was non-existent after about five minutes. I had showered about a half-hour prior to usage, had not applied body lotion, etc., just clean dry skin. Very disappointing results with this product. FYI:I have since found out that hairpiece and wig shops sell a double sided tape that works perfectly for these situations; something you might want to try if you have the same results that I had."
3,Mixed Results,"The first time I used the tape, it held extremely well. Although, with loose fabric, my clothes sometimes puckered funny when I was moving because the rest of the shirt was moving as I walked, but where it was taped, it was held firmly in place. The second time I used the product it was an extremely hot day and the tape did not do well in sweaty conditions. Within 2 hours it had pulled off and had lost all its stickiness."
1,WORKED BEFORE BUT NEW FORMULA DOESN'T WORK,"I'M TIRED OF REPUTABLE COMPANIES MAKING CRAP WHEN SOME NUT TAKES OVER THE COMPANY AND HAS THE IDEA TO CHANGE THINGS UP TO MAKE MORE MONEY. THIS USED TO WORK SO GREAT BUT NOW WORKS WORTH NOTHING. SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED, AND MOST LIKELY SOME BUBBLE-HEAD TOOK OVER AND WANTED TO SAVE MONEY BUT FOULED EVERYTHING UP, THEY LOST ME AS A CUSTOMER AS THEY WILL LOSE MANY MANY OTHERS. I DON'T WORK IN THE THEATRE OR WITH COSTUMES, BUT IF I DID I'D BE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE. I BUY MAYBE $30 A YEAR ON TAPE LIKE THIS.I NOW USE BRAZA BODY TAPE, DOUBLE SIDED. WORKS GREAT."
2,Not so sticky,"I was disappointed after trying this product, based on the glowing reviews. I needed to keep a formal dress in place, but the tape did not work for me. Perhaps it had to do with the inner lining of the dress. It was a BCBG dress, very constructed bodice, with an inner lining made of an almost mesh fabric. The tape did not stick at all. Perhaps I can use it in the future to try with a garment that has a more fluid fabric. It was a mess with the dress. Sorry that I cannot recommend, but I think it may not work in all cases."
2,Double Sided Fashion Tape,Did not last longer than a few minutes. Garment must be very loose to work. Any movement and it's coming undone.Don't try this with a wrap shirt that you are trying to eliminate cleavage. You will be disappointed.Probably best with hems or flowing garments.
4,Hollywood Fashion Tape Double-Stick Strips with Take Away Tin 36 ea,I love this item. In fact I like it so much that I have purchased them for friends to use. My particular use has been to keep a cartigan sweater together from button to button that might otherwise gap open. I recently purchased a pair of trousers and did not have time to get them hemmed so I used my little tape strips. They work like a charm. There are so many uses for these little gems. I have no problem in recommending them.
3,Better than the similar product from Walmart but not as effective as expected,"The product is more effective on thin fabrics with no texture. My first attempt to use it was on a dress made of thick silk. The tape was not as effective as I hoped for. What is good about it that it comes in strips, so it is easy to remove a top paper layer(like it usually done on a band-aid). The similar product purchased in Walmart came in a tape roll, so was more difficult to manage."
5,Best double sided clothing tape,This double sided clothing tape is great. Other brands leave sticky residue on clothing - not this one. Hollywood tape is the way to go!
4,OK,I got these to wear to a formal event and wanted to make sure my dress stayed in place around the breast area. They worked OK but I would buy them a second time around because they did what I needed them to do.
5,Work Great!,"I would recommend this product to anyone that has that great outfit that just might show a little more than you want. I've used it on silk and fine fabrics with no harm to the fabric. I use it on low cut, drapey, and loose blouses and dresses (although nothing as extreme as the famous J Lo dress, but it could be done). Stays put through dancing an entire night."
3,A Book Designed for a Swim Class,"I was teaching a child how to swim and bought this book as a guide for what to teach. I did not find this book helpful though, as most of the games and activities are geared for a YMCA swim course with many students. The book teaches the reader how to be an instructor for the YMCA. The material in the last two chapters, which explained swim strokes, was the only information that I found somewhat useful."
4,teaching swimming,"I'm actually teaching swim classes at the Y right now, and this book has been a great reference tool. I was pretty much thrown into the class as a floater the first couple of weeks and instructed to teach. The good thing about this book is that it breaks down the fundamentals and actually provides the Y's specific methods. I also purchased the Parent/Child Y instruction book which has been even more helpful."
5,Nothing better on the market,"Beautiful to look at, but does it perform? I have used top-of-the-line cookware: Calphalon (when it was the only ""professional grade"" on the market), All-Clad, Kitchen Aid, Mauviel; the Viking is the most responsive and easiest with which to cook. And it cleans up beautifully. It is heavy, so keep that in mind, but I prefer cooking in heavy vessels. And it is definitely high-end, price-wise, but well worth the cost, as you will never need to replace it. I am replacing all my other cookware with Viking, piece by piece."
3,"Excellent construction, except for the handle","This appears to be a really nice piece of cookware, and its 7-ply construction makes this pan heat up slightly better than an All-Clad pan, which is very difficult to find in a product available to the public rather than just to restaurants and professional chefs. Nonetheless, the ""ergonomic"" handle on this reduction saucepan makes lifting it such a chore that I opted for an All-Clad reduction (Windsor) pan instead. My All-Clad Windsor pan may not conduct heat quite as well, but it is much easier to lift and hold. Considering everything, a pan this expensive should not contain a major design flaw such as the Viking does."
4,Great deal for a nice set!!,Perfect for the small apartment or room. Not cheap looking and it's easy to assemble. It's a strong table with strong chairs and a nice look and feel. I would definitely recommend it!!
4,Very satisfied with the 3-pc set.,"This product has served the purpose of my purchase...a small and modern kitchen dinette. For the price I paid for the set, I couldn't ask for more."
2,Grunge? False.,"This album recieved such great reviews from everyone here on amazon, so I figured it would be worth the five dollar pricetag. I popped it into my stereo and was overcome with a wave of dissapointment. There is no comparison between seaweed and nirvana, soundgarden, or any of the more hailed grunge bands of the early nineties. Seaweed is like listening to a bunch of drunk strangers in a garage somewhere learn how to play together. While Seaweed did represent the Northwest scene, this album sounds much more like punk to me than grunge. The riffs are too fast and irritating and the lead singers voice is too whiny to be called grunge. Instead, I would say this band is a cross between emo and punk with a very small bit of real rock-n-roll mixed in. Unless you love seaweed, this album is far from memorable."
3,Works well for Collimating.,Works well but my focuser will not hold it locked down as tightly as it could be. Rather Simple once you have mapped the reflecting mirror center.Will require a bit of setup work and afterwards some tuning of the mirrors. A Bit to pricey unless you really need a Collimator.
5,I am a fan,I think this book is a lot of fun. My roommate reads the Girls On Film on their web site and bought their book last week. We've been leafing through it and it's good and I found a lot of the movies I like in it. I'd suggest it for anyone a bit on the hipper side.
5,Funny!,"My husband & I heard one of the authors on NPR and went and got this great book. It's very funny and a great read, and I would highly reccomend it!"
2,Doesn't work on textured glass!,"I ordered this squeegee after our old, gross 10 year old squeegee broke - I will say that it does LOOK nice, and works very well on flat surfaces. However, our shower has a dimpled glass texture that this squeegee cannot seem to remove all the water from! We're moving it to our downstairs bathroom, which has a smooth shower door -Overall: Great on flat surfacesFair/Poor on textured surfaces."
2,Look Elsewhere,"I cannot believe the positive reviews about this squeegee, it is terrible. Its to short and way too ridged. This squeegee does not flex at all. I know some people will say you have to break it in but no it should work right out of the package. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it looks good. Will be buying a different one. You cannot trust all reviews, you just have to learn the hard way I guess."
4,"Great cleaning, but a bit boring","I have a trendy sit-down shower with slate walls and ceiling. This OXO squeegee cleans the glass really well without a lot of effort/pressure. That is why I am keeping it. However, it would be great if it were a bit trendier--the section cup is just regular rubber and the handle is a bit ""kitchen-ish"". Overall, I'm still happy with it."
4,Great for shower use!!!,Quality made and stylish. Only complaint would be to have a hole in the handle so I could hang in the shower.
5,Stainless Steel Squeegee,"I needed a squeegee as had purchased new shower doors (Cardinal Skyline and a Double Slider)These OXO stainless steel squeegees are of good build qualityNice clean wipe, I can do just over an 8"" tile and it takes less than a minute to squeegee the doorsI had some trouble keeping the suction cup up, but somehow the wife got it on and it stayed upHighly recommended, no scratches on glass and single wipe removes water without smearing"
3,"Gets the Job Done, not as nice as other OXO Products I've owned","Looks great, blade wasn't quite as wide as i expected. Has a very sturdy feel to it, but when it comes to getting rid of the water, the rubber blade is rather stiff. I had an all plastic OXO Squeegee that i liked better. If you are looking for style first and usability second, this is definately for you. It goes great with my plate glass/brushed nickel shower doors, just wish it were a little more ""Pliable"""
1,"Awful, hard squeegee","Looks nice, but works awful. The edge is way too hard and in order to get the water off- you need to push on it very hard then it stops gliding.The other OXO Good Grips Household Squeegee, Black http://www.amazon.com/Good-Grips-Household-Squeegee-Black/dp/B00004OCLG/ref=sr_1_3?rps=1&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1333493520&sr;=8-3 is not as fancy - but works like charm."
1,terrible x 2 !!!,"We bought this based on positive reviews, however, we received one and the rubber was so warped, it would not clear a thing. We had it exchanged, and the second was as bad as the first. I have no idea if this is because of the way it is shipped or not...but DO NOT BUY THIS!"
3,A short but effective life,"Our glass and tile shower requires the use of this product every day. Over the years we've used many different squeegees. This squeegee gets high marks for being easy to use and effective. It moves smoothly over glass and tile to wick off the water. The size is perfect for dealing with some of the areas that are impossible with larger squeegees. It's also nicely quiet when going over tiles - not like some that sound like you're driving on the bumps in the middle of the road.The drawback is that this only lasted a couple of months before the rubber blade started leaving ugly streaks of rubber all over our white tiles. The squeegee is stored above where the water reaches in the shower, so I've no idea why it decayed so quickly. I've never had a squeegee die so fast. So be forewarned, it's a very effective tool, but it may wear out very early compared to others.We're going to give it one more try in the hopes that our first one was defective."
3,Replacement blades not available,"First of all, this squeegee works great! I've tried several in our shower, and this one by far exceeds any other I've tried in removing water from the shower door cleanly, in only one pass.I knocked two stars off the review because, they do NOT sell replacement blades for it (I called OXO and verified this). It looks like the rubber blade can easily be removed and replaced, but they are forcing me to throw the handle in the landfill because the current blade wore out. So, 5 stars for a great squeegee, but zero stars to OXO for not being conservation-minded."
1,Mislabeled and Misled,I ordered this specifically because I didn't want some of the smaller options. It is described as 11 inches wide. It is only 10. Seems really small for doing a whole shower. Not worth returning given that I have to eat the shipping charges. I feel cheated.
5,clean and sleek,"I have a huge clear glass shower that needed a squeegee that could withstand the daily use and grunge. This squeegee not only works well, but also looks sleek enough to be seen in my shower. I like the fact that it doesn't fall off from it's holder. It looks well made and hopefully, it will last for a while."
5,what i was looking for,"this is exactly what i have been looking for. love the suction cup holder. the only down side is the size of the scrapper, wish it was about 3 inches longer"
3,squeaky,I thought that since this was OXO it would be great but not so. Blade not flexible and not long enough. Also squeaks. Just not user friendly.
3,"Looks great, but not very effective","I don't think you'll find a better looking squeegee out there. The OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Squeegee fits very nicely into my recently remodeled master bath. The stainless steel and black color fit right in and provide an elegant look to an otherwise boring tool. So 5 stars for good looks.But, as a squeegee it needs some improvement. I do like the 10 inch wide blade, that helps move water off the shower quickly, but as it does so it also leaves a bit of residue every time you stop or shift direction. It does not provide a clean wipe. Also, be aware that the stainless steel edging could potentially scratch glass or tile if you're not careful. I prefer a plastic tool over this one for that reason.If you have large hands you may find the very small handle.. well, hard to handle!I give it 3 stars overall. Not a bad product, but not great and I considering the rather expensive cost of this product I don't believe you get your moneys worth."
3,Beautiful but...,"I have the Good Grips plastic squeegee in one of our bathrooms and it works great. When we remodeled the master bath I wanted something a bit more elegant looking, and it is, but it does not have the same flexibility on the rubber strip. Perhaps there is variation from unit to unit as this item has so many good reviews, but I find I have to press really hard for it to work. Even then, it leaves behind so much more water than the plastic one does. We have smooth, clear glass, brand new, so a decent squeegee should be able to handle the job. Looks like we will have to sacrifice form for function and go back to the chunky white plastic!"
5,Great tool,"This is my first squeegee purchase. I relied heavily on other reviews and felt comfortable with the purchase. It is easy to use, cuts into corners and clears the water effectively. I highly recommend the product."
2,Short lifespan,"I cannot recommend this product. The black rubber (or rubber like compound) starts to deteriorate quickly, leaving hard to remove black streaks over white ceramic tiles that I'm still trying to get off. The housing seems sturdy and the suction cup holder is hardy, so I'll give the OXO squeegee with the clear rubber. Crossing my fingers."
2,These break.,"We got these because the thin crayons break on us. I think these actually break more easily. I love Crayola products generally because they are non-toxic and have lots of color options and are easy to use, but these did not work for what we wanted, which was non-breakable crayons."
2,Good for a short time,"When I received it, I thought, the unfinished edges must be a problem. I was right. This is definitely more fragile than the original Canon strap.The foam will begin to rip, and the camera will literally be hanging from a thread. Mine has already ripped from two points. I do use the camera quite often, as a photojournalist, having carried 40d, 70-200mm 2.8 and a 580ex on it some times. I've had it for almost a month.I think Tamrac may make ones with finished edges, but the best thing for you is to go to a physical brick and mortar store to test out and feel the straps. You can also try Lowepro, or OP/Tech.Pros: it has memory card holders with quick release and a bounce comfortable feeling"
2,Good design bad construction,"I like the design and how it works. Very comfortable, handy memory card pockets. Also there are clips at the end of the strap so you can quickly remove the strap if the strap gets in your way on a shoot.My problem is the neoprene material is covered by cloth, which after only a few uses is peeling off the neoprene strap. I'm not sure the long term consequences of this. So far it still works fine. I don't know if the cloth is there to give it strength or cosmetic. If it's for strength, then the neoprene may start to rip or come apart."
1,Didn't work for me,"I tried all of the suggestions for hookup and I ensured that I had the TV output set to yes ... and I got sound without any picture. It might not be the cables, but I'm not sure. I believe that my 80gb iPod is a 4G, but maybe I'm wrong. Unfortunately, I waited too long to check that everything worked, so I can't return. There goes $20 for nothing."
2,No Video with Ipod touch & iPod Video,"Bought this in hopes it would work with my iPod touch. No Deal! Nor did it work with my nieces iPod Video. It gives sound, but no picture even after trying several suggestions recommended here, several combination set ups and settings, and several TV sets. Returning. :-(Meanwhile the make of the Belkin cable quality and length is very nice for those items that it does work with."
2,Can't even use it,"I ordered this A/V cable for a client showing since I didn't want to carry extra baggage. The cable arrived in time, but on plugging it in I found the cable damaged by a short in the video side. Since, it only cost $20 bucks, I threw it in the trash and bought a more expensive cable at my local Radio Shack. I'm sure if it worked I would continue to use it with my iPod, but alas it's history."
1,Not gonna happen,"This item does not work. The 3.5mm jack atop the the Ipod does not produce a video signal. Therefore you will only get sound through this cord. I tried this cable on 2 diferent tvs, even called Belkin, they were cluless. Kept saying that it was my Ipod or my TV that was not working correctly."
5,Fantastic Read,"Basically I ordered this book for my wife, as she is an occupational therapist and avid pianist, and she is almost finished with the book already...after 4 days! She cannot put it down and told me that the outlining of the joints, muscles and posture positions are fantastic. I bought a piano for her and my 2 daughters this Christmas and thoght she would be able to use this as a teaching tool for them. I will update this review in several weeks as she implements the facts fo this book into her lessons with the girls."
5,Very helpful,"I reference this book during most of my practice sessions. Several ideas, like the arch (p 111), little finger orientation, and the arm as connected to the back (p 70) are simply invaluable, and the solutions he gives make a difference. A bargain for the knowledge that is in here.NOTE: This is a book to read and reread in small sections at a time (ie 1-3 pages), preferably near a piano. Otherwise, you will not be able to mine the gems of Dr. Mark's work."
5,another good product,"Came quickly, good shape. Good for children learning piano. Daughter enjoys all the music and can be good for self learners as well."
3,incomplete,"The review says that the book includes information on St. Lucia and St. Maarten/St. Martin. It does not. It totally ignores most of the smaller islands of the Caribbean. I realize that they could not fit an in-depth analysis of all the Caribbean islands into one book, but to totally ignore the vast majority of islands makes this book incomplete and disappointing."
1,Very disapointing,"I am doing a cruise down the leeward chain and thought this book would help me during my cruise. To my disappointment I found that over 75% of the islands were not included. Aruba but no Bonaire or Curacao. The BVI and AVI but no Antigua, Nevis, St Barts, St Kitts, Montserrat, Dominica, Martinique,St Lucia, St Vincent, Bequia to name some of the missing islands. I may be a dummy but I know cruise ships stop at these islands too so I give a thumbs down on this book. Do't waste you money"
4,Great guide to the islands,"The best way to evaluate any travel guide is to put it to practical use. Luckily, the day after I acquired ""Caribbean for Dummies,"" my husband and I headed off on a two-week cruise. What better way to test the book out? Based on our admittedly unscientific (but highly practical) testing, ""Caribbean for Dummies"" is a roaring success. We used it constantly (we wanted to find some off the beaten path stuff to do in each port) and the recommendations and information were all spot on. The book is clearly written, concise and chock-full of useful details. It's particularly useful for cruise passengers, since many cruise lines don't give you much information about what to do on shore, aside from ""Shop here, shop there, and don't drink the water."" This book provided excellent details on restaurants, attractions and culture. Don't leave home without it!"
4,Zero Waste RO System,"Once the system is installed it works well. The diagram that comes with the system does not apply to all Watts RO systems. Additional diagrams were not available online from Watts. I emailed their service department, told them what RO system I had, and they responded that the zero waste system I bought would not work with my Watts RO system.Thankfully a phone call to the technical department resulted in a new diagram with some modifications and we were able to complete installation. The transformer that came with the system was faulty. But, with the proof of the purchase of a new transformer from Radio Shack, Amazon credited our account for $30 which was fair."
3,Not a Pizza Pan!,"While this is a good quality crisper pan, it is not a pizza crisper. It is an 11 x 13 inch, rectangular crisper pan. One end narrows and is slanted upward to easily slide items off the pan. The actual usable space is 11"" square. It would be great for Fries, Garlic Bread and such. But, you can't fit a round pizza on a 11"" suare; at least I can't anyway. I gave it 3 stars for the inaccurate description, not for the quality of the pan."
4,great pan,I love the nonstick-ness and convenient size. We have made pizza once and chex-mix a different time. Crispy and delicious. Has been easy to clean.
5,I wish I'd bought several while they were in stock,"They are really beautiful, the photo does not do justice."
3,Good introduction to general C++ programming,"The book begins with hints for installation, and a quick tour of the basic features of the Borland C++ IDE. Following this are sections on C++ and object oriented programming that include example programs. This provides a good introduction for beginners to C++. However, very little attention is given to OWL and windows programming. To learn windows programming with Borland C++, you should get a different book."
2,Option Package Offense,"I was very disappointed in this book. It's attention to detail was weak , the writing was poor and a good portion of the book dealt with running an I attack. There are many other books on the veer that are better-Wacker & Morton, Holtz, Homer Smith etc."
4,Another great New Orleans CD,"This is a bit different from Irma's past Rounder CD's, not quite as straightforward R&B. Variety of song genres and the instrumentation is also different from her previous albums. The one constant is her voice, which sounds as good as ever. I'm a long-time fan and enjoy this one very much."
2,After the Rain,"I had never heard of her before I saw her do a song on TV which I greatly enjoyed so I looked her up on the internet. She has a very good voice and a couple of tracks I liked very much, but for the most part the record for me is blah. I have it in my car and it is kind of like elevator background music. She is talented and maybe I would enjoy some of her other records, but I'm not willing to put out the money to take the chance."
5,Best Dead Head Gift Ever!,"My husband loved it so much. He instantly contacted all his dead head friends to brag about it. Him and the guys have already spent hours searching for the songs they love. It is not just another picture, but entertainment as well. For a while we were reading the concert books everytime we turned on the sirius radio. (That is a great gift also for any dead fan) Now we see the title of the song and try to imagine the picture in our head and see if it might be on the poster."
5,Awesome Poster,"This is a great poster. A must have, it is soo cool and gets quite a bit of compliments. :)"
3,Unbalanced story that is interesting yet frustrating.,I thought this book did an excellant job in character development and motivation. Unfortunately I thougth the political motivations and assumptions were less realistic and believable. The concept of an early in end to the European theatre with the Americans not directly involved seems rather a large leap in logic. I will not tell more so as not to ruin the read for others but this type of thinking prevades the novel.Over all this is not a bad read but I do not consider it a first rate alternate history novel. I would consider buying other novels by this author however. Well written in an inovative fashion.
4,A winner!,"A winner! Ms. Hayden has brought to life an alternate history in which Japan did not lose the war, and her grasp of the politics and culture of that period makes for a vivid read. The characters are so three dimensional that they seem to walk off the pages. The plot is compelling, the story-telling dynamic. While PACIFIC EMPIRE is really a series of interconnected short stories, the pace is that of a well crafted novel. A fascinating concept, and carried out to perfection. -- Elizabeth Dearl, short fiction author"
3,A good enough read - but I expected more,"From the glowing accolades of the other reviewers, I thought Pacific Empire would be tremendous. Alas, it was merely okay. The premise--Japan wins the Pacific side of WWII--is more atypical then might be expected, given the glut of WWII European theatre alternate history. The characters are interesting, and, if accurate, give insight into the Japanese mindset of the middle 20th Century. The episodic story-telling, however, left me a bit cold. I feel that Hayden wanted both the quick read of a short story and the grand sweep of a novel in Pacific Empire, and in trying for both she achieved neither. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book, I just thought that it lacked consistency in its storytelling and that lessened my reading experience."
5,Intricate and interesting,"After years of reading non fiction, this was my initiation back into fictional reading. It was typically Japanese in it's approach as it should be, with a feeling of formality, which provided an authenticity to the backdrop. The addition of a non historical perspective allowed the readers mind to engage in possibility thinking, while following the short story format. The stories were linked by character relations and maintained family connections from the first through the last story.I found it a thought provoking concept and the author's approach, at least for this reader, interesting and delightful. Having read other offerings by this author, it's easy to render a hearty recommendation."
4,Interesting,"The value in owning lesser know and fragmentary works of the great composers is to view their artistic development and judgements. Mozart abandoned composing L'oca del Cairo because, as he states in a letter to his father Leopold, it was just plain dumb. And listening to this fragment, we can see that Mozart's heart just wasn't into it.I give this disc four stars for the second fragment, Lo Sposo deluso, which is absolutely brilliant and makes me wish he completed the opera."
4,Delightful early operas!,"No ""Don Giovanni's"" here, but utterly charming music nonetheless from a young Mozart. Superb performances too."
1,AAAHHH!,I first heard of these guys through Amazon and figured I'd look into them. I really dug the guitars and thought that the guy was a very good rapper.... Then I found out what he was rapping about. The entire cd is about how they're stalkers and rapists and how they have sex with dead bodies. I really don't think that kind of stuff deserves to be paid for. cause I would just be putting money into their pockets for being disgusting freaks.Daddy Long Legs was better in the Bloodhound Gang. Check them out...
5,A fantastic page-turner.,"Brittany Cavanaugh, an oceanographer from the year 2001, travels to post Civil War era, where she is mistaken for the leader of an elusive White Slavery Ring. She meets the infamous Jacques Devereaux, a Civil War blockade runner turned White Slaver, but her heart is torn when she must choose between the pirate and Clay Gentry, a southern gentleman who is in the midst of a desperate search for his missing twin sisters--and the President's daughter.Also recommended: 'Charmed Passage' by Jean Hackensmith & Kathe Birth and 'Doomed Passage' by Jean Hackensmith & Kathe Birch"
5,Excellent,"I have the Viking 4.5 quart saucepan but since that is no longer available at Amazon and no one has rated this pan, I decided to do so. I compared Viking to All Clad and to the stainless steel KitchenAid and found the Viking to be far superior. The biggest difference is the handle, which is the best I've seen on any brand. The handle stays cool and, most important, is so well designed that picking up and moving pans is easy even when the pan is full. This difference from AC and KA is most evident when one tries to tilt the pan. Both the others cut into your hand. Their handles also do not stay as cool. The Viking lid also stays cooler than AC or KA. Cooking itself, of course, is excellent. (I asume the other two are equal but I do not know that.) Well worth the extra $10-15."
5,Just right for 2-4 year olds,"This is a video that is just right for younger children. The animations are Sesame-street like BUT slower in pace so the child can actually learn what he is seeing on the screen. It teaches lower and uppercase letter and asks the child to repeat the sounds. We first got the tape from our library but now I have bought a copy here. My son goes around repeating words from the tape. He has watched it many many times and this is one tape I do not mind him watching over and over again. Of all the phonics tapes, I think this one is probably the nicest. No adults talking to the blackboard, just cute animations, that do not run at hundred miles an hour with fast music. Slow and gentle. Very different and well worth the money. Be sure to look at the companion book - Reading Lesson - if your kid is ready to read. Book is good too."
3,it works but its ugly,"the format is sloooowoo but i guess thats good for kids, painful for adults. does the job but its painfully ugly and quality reminds me of a vhs tape that i had as a kid."
5,Buy this before they stop makeing them,"If you need a simple littler calculator that just works and is easy to read in low light, go to office depot and get this before they stop selling them. The display is huge and the buttons are all within reach of your thumb for one handed use. The back pops off with the removal of 6 screws for idiot proof battery replacement. It has stood up to light ran and drops on the ground. It a good little cheap calculator, I hope mine last a long time because I want one just like it when it inevitably brakes from the way I treat it.."
4,"Chilling, ingenious.","The novel is a progression of stories, each told by a different narrator, and written at a different time, but each casting light on the events and characters in the previous stories. The title, as well as the story names, seem to suggest that this is a philosophical novel about loss of identity. I don't quite take it away. It is a chilling, almost soulless evocation of the dislocations of 20th century central Europe, a time when nihilism seems most in tune with the world. Identities are not lost so much as stolen. It is written in a simple, effective style, and the plotting is ingenious and highly original. One of the characters, Richard Schley, battles for the remnant of his soul, and I enjoyed most the story narrated by him. Conversely, I found little to like or admire in the first story of the novel, so my advice to readers put off by that material is to stick with it, the rest of the novel is 5 star."
4,Good Stuff.,The fit was great and easy to install. Long time till replacement needed. The noise went up a little in the cab though under acceleration and performance increase is hardly perceptable if any. Hence the 4 star rating.
2,I don't like Nina's early work as much as her later work,"I like Nina's later work, Wild Is The Wind, The Other Woman and Don't Explain, all on her Finest Hour, CD. I also think the background music is so much better. One can tell she and the music improved as the years went on. When I first heard Nina singing, Wild Is The Wild, I was 18 years old and she made me feel this was how I wanted my love to feel and be! So if you want to hear Nina at her very best, get Nina Simone's Finest Hour,CD."
3,Fun!,"An amusing story of Harvard & Radcliffe students set in Cambridge, Mass in the late 1950s. Caused quite a stir around Harvard Square when it first came out. Cleverly constructed and, yes, superficial, but fun for the way it captures the spirit of its era. It's alleged that many of the characters were based on actual people...some of whom went on to distinguished careers. As for the author, ""Leonie St. John"" was a pen-name used by a male-female couple each of whom has since gone on separately to write far better books!"
5,it's what i expected,Pretty good quality crayons. I work with large groups of children and they love to put the crayons back because each color has a separate section in sturdy box they come in.
1,pretty awful,"Since we're going to Buenos Aires in several months I was looking forward to this DVD. It was truly awful. Terrible script, pretentious narration, clumsy filming. Pass this one by."
2,Mediocre sketch book,The quality of sketches in this book is mediocre at best. Colors are also washed out.
1,Piece of junk.,"I ordered this cabinet almost exactly a year ago. Last month, the inside of the faucet literally deteriorated. Water was coming out of the top, where the handle pulls up. I called the company and they promised to replace it. A week went by. No faucet. I called again and they claimed to have no record of my phone call. So another customer service rep said she would send out the faucet. Another week goes by. I call again. Still no record of my call and yet another person said they would ship the faucet ""right out"". I just got an email, again almost a week later, saying they can't ship me a new faucet because they no longer ""do that"".Ironically, one of my neightbors saw this unit in my bathroom and loved it so much, he bought the exact same one. His has also completely fallen apart. I think it's safe to say this is a defective product."
4,Not good for liquids,"This item is great for everything else except for liquids. Everywhere else is a tight seal except for the hinge area. Except for that, it works wonderfully for everything else.Tip I got from another site:Some cheesecakes require that the pan be set in water to chill; however, due to the construction of a springform pan, if this method is applied the pan will leak. To avoid this, simply wrap the pan in two layers of aluminum foil. It is a good idea to wrap the pan in aluminum foil with all kinds of cakes to be sure that batter does not leak out. Alternatively, place the springform pan on a cooking sheet when baking to catch the leaks. Another handy idea to consider when using a springform pan is to place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and then place a pan of water on the bottom rung of the oven. The water will help minimize the cracking in the top of the cheesecake."
3,Suitable For Baking in a Water Bath?,"Genarally a good, durable cake pan, and works well, if the cheesecake recipe calls for a crust, and the usual oven baking. Water leaks in though when the empty pan is placed in a water bath, which a particular cheese cake recipe (no crust) required. Perhaps water might not have leaked in if the pan were already filled with the thicker batter, but I did not want to risk it, and so simply used another cake pan."
5,No Alibi,"Carl Hancock Rux has done it AGAIN! simply put, this is the best cd of the year. Carl continues to amaze me with every production (books, cds, plays) - hate i missed his performance in D.C. with the video artist (included on this enhanced cd) Jaco Van Schalkwyk (incredibly talented Brooklynite / South African). This cd is well worth ANY price. Buy it - and keep your eyes on this pair of artists representing Ft.G. properly."
3,"Lots of practice, but could use better explanations","If you're looking for tons of practice, this is the book may be for you. The book is page after page of examples. The main downfall of this book is that the explanations are only a sentence long. At times this made it difficult to understand why an answer choice was wrong. I'd prefer better explanations than quantity.Another problem was the extensive vocabulary list.It would have been easier to learn if Barron's clustered their words into groups like in their Hot Word's for the SAT I book.Overall, I'd rather spend my money on the Kaplan Verbal Book for the better explanations"
4,There has to be more,"I know i've seen footage in the past that is not on the video and i've been to the CM hall of music museum in Nashville and seen the banks of archived videos. There has got to be more. Notwithstanding, if your a fan you can't live without this one."
3,The Queen of Country Torch,"For those of us of a certain age (growing up in the early 1960's) the timeless voice of Patsy Cline, whether we were aware of it or not, formed the backdrop to many a school dance or other romantic endeavor. I was not a fan of Cline's, at least consciously, growing up but have come to appreciate her talent and her amazing voice. In another review in this space I have called her the `country torch singer' par excellence. And she does not fail here. At least musically. However, cinematically is another question. While it was interesting (and a little disconcerting) to see the old black and white television clips I do not believe that this compilation does justice to her work. Patsy, like many another torch singer like Bessie Smith or Billie Holliday, needs to grow on you. The best way to do that is grab a Greatest Hits album and sit back. You won't want to turn the damn thing off. As for this film, if you have time watch it."
5,"Mozart, Gamerra, and the dictator of Rome","This was my first opera recording that I listened to with libretto, and I must say that this is a very interesting opera to listen to. Another reason for purchasing this opera is that this a complete, unabridged performance, unlike the Nikolaus Harnoncourt recording of the same opera, which omits 4 or 5 arias in total including the advisor/tribune Aufidio's only aria, No. 8: ""Guerrier, che d'un acciaro."" Also, there was a great translation of Gamerra's already excellent libretto as well as a very thoughtful plot synopsis. I was lucky to get this opera at all; I luckily found that some people were selling the opera on the section of ""used and new"" to those who had noticed that the opera was out of stock. Finally, there are excellent photographs of the singers as well as an excellent bust of the opera's most-important-in-hierarchy character, the ancient Roman dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. An absolutely recommended at all costs great buy."
2,a little disappointing,"While a fan of the Justice League cartoon and a long time follower of the John Stewart character in the comics, I didn't like this book as much as others in the series. I had hoped for more ooomph in this tale about GL being stuck on an alien world. The villain was not all that engaging, and the story seemed to just plod along and then end. Yawn."
5,Love It!,"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this book! After my husband was put on a strict diet for health reasons, we had to make a change in the way we ate. This book has offered lots of great recipes to try and we haven't missed meat at all. Thanks!"
2,basic and uninteresting vegetarian recipies,"Though included in this book were recipies for many, many differeny vegetables, none were very creative or inspiring. Just basic stuff."
2,Eh.,"This book is ok, but you can probably find better vegetarian recipes than this collection online. I'd save my money."
5,The Everything Vegetarian Cookbook,"As recent arrivals in the vegetarian world, we are very pleased with this informative and well-written book.We look forward to many healthy meals, without the gnawing feeling that some animal was killed to feed our carnivore tastes.Well done, and thanks."
4,veggies rule,So far I have only tried a couple things but looking through the book I can see many more that I will try. It's a book worth exploring.
4,good investment when using soundbar,Used my EQ for enhancing the quality of music from my pyle. Soundbar great combo a few set of AV cables and the EQ made a world of difference. Great buy
4,Works well,"The equalizer works well, but a digital system that can ""remember"" various music types (classical, Jazz, Rock, etc) would have been more usefull. I had to make a drawing of each application (for example old turntable, jazz, classical) settings and change the sliders every time I change my CD or phono music. Next step is to upgrade to a better system I guess ..."
1,STAY ALWAY FROM THIS JUNK,"I READ THE REVIEWS OF THE PRODUCT AND DIDN'T LISTEN TO THEM. THREE MONTHS AFTER I HAD IT THE EQ BUTTON STARTED ACTING UP AND CHANNELS WERE CUTTING OUT AND THE PROBLEM GOT PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. TO THE POINT THAT IT WAS TOTALLY ANNOYING. THEN THE SOUND QUALITY WENT BAD ON IT. I STARTED GETTING DISTORTION AND I WOULD SOMETIMES GET THESE SONIC SCREECHES EVEN WITH THE TREBLE TURNED DOWN ON THE AMP. THE UNIT HAS A LEFT AND A RIGHT CHANNEL VOLUME CONTROL, IT WAS A NICE FEATURE IF YOU WANTED TO TWEAK THE BALANCE IN YOUR ROOM. THEN THE RIGHT CHANNEL WENT SOUR AND DROPPED HALF ITS VOLUME. THAT'S WHEN THE AUDIOSOURCE EQ200 TOOK A LITTLE TRIP TO THE GARBAGE DUMPSTER. EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY IS BASED IN AMERICA IT'S ACTUALLY CHEAP CHINESE JUNK. MANUFACTURED IN CHINA WITH CHEAP,INFERIOR PARTS. NO QUALITY WENT INTO THIS MACHINE, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I CLEANED UP MY OLD TEAC EQUALIZER THAT I'VE HAD SINCE THE LATE 70'S AND MY SOUND SYSTEM IS BACK IN BUSINESS."
1,Not Very Good Quality Equipment,It worked well for the first few months but then the left channel started getting static in it and soon went dead. It shouldn't have gone bad so quickly. I'm using a Pioneer receiver that is pushing 10 years in age and it still works beautifully. I don't know if I just got a lemon or not but I won't be buying another.
3,Graphic Equalizer,"Nobody uses these anymore, but I like to use them to fine tune my system to the room its in."
4,"Good unit, great price","I just received my unit - purchased directly from the manufacturer at a better price than Amazon. I was a bit apprehensive based on all the reviews that I've read on Amazon but I also didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on my Pioneer stereo (circa 1985).It was easy to setup and connected my CD and turntable within minutes. I was puzzled the lack of sound from my turn table but thankfully I had an turn table amp that I purchased from Amazon (see that review) a few years back, connected it and records play wonderfully.I do not have issues that others have reported, like I said, it sounds great and it was easy to setup. I would say this is a great buy."
4,This is a great EQ,"I had invested in a good home theatre system but the sound output was lacking, I had a friend who recommended this product and I will forever be greatful to the EQ, My sound is just excellent. I highly recommend this product to you if you want good quality sound. It is just great."
2,Strap with memory chip pouches.,"The strap is good, feels good and sets good. Problem lies with the pouches, the regular size memory chips will not fit securely in the pouches. No real big deal for using the strap, disappointing with not being able to secure memory cards. Oh well!"
5,Great used item. Unmarked pages.,"As far as the product quality goes, it was just what I expected for a ""used"" item, slightly worn on the cover but overall in good shape with no marks on the inside pages. As far as books go, I recommend any of Kenneth Taylor's books. This particular one is great for a short story before bedtime with a biblical lesson to think about."
4,An unequal contest in this Schauspieldirektor....,"Unhappily for all concerned this recording was hopelessly miscast. The whole point of Der Schauspieldirektor is the vocal duel between the two sopranos...""Ich bin die erste sangerin"" Madame Herz should crow to Madame Silberklang. Pitting the woefully thin and empty soprano of Ruth Welting against the full and luscious voice of Ileana Cotrubas was a non starter, and this recording suffers accordingly. Colin Davis conducts with brio.Cotrubas sings with her customary intelligence, refinement and beauty. What a shame."
4,Worthwhile,"This is a nice summary of the fundamentals of Modal Logic. He does a great job explaining the philosophy behind the concepts and the history of the ideas. But, his explanation of the proofs is scanty at best and he lacks clear examples and illustrations. If you want to understand the philosophy then its solid. If you want to be proficient at the proofs then keep looking. Also, it lacks an answer key which adds to the difficulty of the exercises."
3,helpful but annoying at times,"i only read the first several chapters of this book. i was lookng for an intro text on modal logic and i found this one. this text would be infinitely better if the answers to the exercises were given in the back of the book. it is difficult to tell if one is getting it, if one does not know if one is doing the exercises correctly. because of that i put this one on my shelf and picked up hughes and creswell's book, they have answers to their exercises; they use a diferent notiation but who cares."
1,Sorry fans ....,"I really do not like the way Dame Janet sings Mozart, I love her Schubert and Faurè on Hyperion collections and I also love when she sings many other lieder (or songs), but to opera Dame Janet Baker is not what I excpect from a singer, I only loved the performance of Lucia Popp, her voice is quite angelicate. I prefer the recording of Sir J. E. Gardiner with Mrs. Varady as Vitelia and Anne Sophie Von Otter as Sesto. But the best Vitelia you will find in Della Jones' interpretation for this role, under Hogwood, ....I have never seen someone like her singing this role, that is one of the most exquisite and dificult roles in the universo of the Mozart operas. And, of course, Colin Davis is not a really good conductor on Mozart ... he loses himself easily in the huge universe that Mozart is."
2,Somewhat catchy but overwhelmingly redundant,"I decided to give this album a chance based on several glowing reviews, but after a few listens, I can honestly say that I don't get the appeal of if. There are a couple of tracks that have mildly catchy hooks, but overall, the instrumentation is repetitive and the lyrics are sophomoric. I'm not sure if the reviewers that fawned over this had not heard a solid melody in a few years, but ""Popularity"" is largely forgettable.Sure, I like to support the smaller fish just as much as the next guy, but for those that are looking for a good ""dance rock"" album that you'll actually remember listening to the next day, I'd suggest buying one of the Killers albums or the Brothers Martin album instead of this."
4,Popularity by Jonezetta,"Took a while to get to me, but CD is pretty good, some good musical ideas and creativity. With a little bit of elbow grease and uniqueness, i think this band could be very very awesome."
3,Alot better than I thought it was going to be,"Which isn't saying much. I am very glad that it was worth the 6 dollars I paid for it, and the band does have talent, but its all been done before. Alot better. By other bands."
1,Caution before buying Tensor Products,"I can not recommend any Tensor or Catalina lighting product due to their horrendous customer service! If you attempt to contact them about a warranty issue, they promise they will take care of it, but they never send you the paperwork necessary to process the return.When I called their customer service department in Canada to complain, they got extremely nasty saying ""its only a light"" and ""I do not get paid enough to deal with these problems"" In summary I believe that Catalina/ Tensor products are poorly made, and the company does not stand behind its products"
1,Wait for Warner Brothers DVD restoration in 2007!,"In general I like the Digi-View Cartoon Craze DVDs. You usually get rare obscure cartoons in presentable, if not good, condition for generally a dollar.But when it comes to Popeye, I must tell everyone that Warner Brothers is gotten the rights to restore the classic B&W; and Color theatrical Popeyes from 35mm master negatives for a 2007 release. So wait for that release."
2,Get a Nikon,"Received this as a gift. Ran about 5 rolls of film through it. It took decent pictures. Nothing to write home about. Then the lcd stopped working. Canon fixed it under warranty quickly and with no problems. The camera frequently has trouble focusing on subjects. So...good customer support, but only so so operation and pictures."
3,not bad for a film camera,"the view lens behind the camera is located on the left hand side of the camera making it difficult to use, most film cameras have it in the middle, this way the user can use either their left of right eye."
2,Canon Sure Shot-can do better,I purcahsed this camera a year ago. I have been continuously disappointed in it. The picture quality is far from impressive. Its easy to use and thats about the best I can say about it.
5,spoken like a god,"this video has changed my life in many ways. It has opened my eyes to the world. I dont think you can watch this video and not have your values changed. If I could be one person I would be him and if I couldnt be him I would want to be his son. Every thing that comes out of this mans mouth is gold ""I didnt see the ballot""."
5,love book but having trouble with instructions.,"I love the sweater patterns in this book. I am making the white elegant evening tunic, I am having trouble with the neck shaping instructions. I have taken it to a yarn shop and they can't figure it out. They think there is a misprint in the left side of the neck shaping. To bad there is no phone number to call for possible errors or to explain. I also am using the size hook and same yarn recommended and it is coming out to big."
1,Mistakes in patterns,"I got this book from the library. I specifically wanted to make the coat/jacket/sweater that is pictured with her and her son. I wanted to make the jacket for my granddaughter.I admit that I am new to garment making but I sucessfully made the back, sleeves, collar, then after dozens of times trying to make the front pieces, I finally contacted the publisher.Was NOT me........the pattern had mistakes.Correct me if I am wrong, but don't they test these patterns after they are printed. Poor editing.....Tried cover shawl.....gave up on that too......more mistakesSure glad I did not buy this book."
5,VERY IMPRESSIVE,I HAVE JUST FINISH READING THE BOOK MENTORING AND THE RITES OF PASSAGE YOUTHS.......I MUST SAY THAT I WAS VERY IMPRESSED...IT IS ABOUT TIME SOMEONE STOOD UP AND LOOKED CHALLENGED IN THE EYE AND SAID ...I AM READY TO TAKE THAT STAND....AND NO ITS NOT EASY BUT ITS WORTH WORKING FOR...OUR YOUNG MEN NEED THIS GUIDANCE..AND THIS IS THE IDEA BOOK FOR OUR YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES TO LIVE BY AND USE AS A DAILY GUIDANCE TO DIRECT THEIR PATHS...I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERY MOTHER AND FATHER WITH YOUNG MALES/FEMALES ...THIS IS A MUST READ BOOK....
5,You must buy this,"Like the others said, great rock album. I was listenting to this while drinking copius amounts of alcohol and indulging in all sorts of chemical recreation as high school graduate and college drop out back in the early 90s. If you are the worthless bastard that stole my copy back then, a million curses on you. May your testes and/or ovaries shrivel, blacken and pass from your body. But back to the point at hand...Buy this now, put it in and turn the volume to a completely unacceptable level."
3,Mine arrived damaged.,Some things you cannot tell from the picture are that the underside dome is not completely round like the ones at physical therapy. They are more of a plus sign. Mine arrived damaged the roller was all torn up and the non-slip foot pads where pulled up and the wood scratched. Accidents happen in shipping I realize this. Amazon makes it right PRONTOI decided to order another one offered here at Amazon and it is really much nicer. More like the one I use at Physical therapy. It is black with a red center.It's all according to what your personal choice is but this one is not quite as durable as the other one.
3,didn't like the adjustable base,"I prefer the older model that had a fixed base. That was what I thought I was ordering, but it turns out that Go Fit doesn't make that model anymore. Home Fitness was great about providing a refund. Anyway, the product was fine, but I just preferred the other style."
5,Great Product,I bought this after an ankle injury. It's a great product and the DVD guides you through various strength/stretching exercises. It definitely speeds up recovery after a injury and helps prevent future injuries...
5,It's your own private physical therapist!,I bought this after a serious ankle sprain a year ago did not heel up well. It left me with lots of scar tissue and fears of needing ankle surgery down the line. The DVD shows you lots of great exercises for ankle strengthening and over-all balance improvement. I feel better navigating steep stairs carrying my 1 year old after just a couple workouts with it! I feel like I'll be able to ice skate and ski with my kids now! Cool!
3,"Like the Board, Very Disappointed with GoFit Customer Service","Ordered the wobble board and like another reviewer, received the board along with the DVD. The DVD is defective (will not play on any of my DVD players or computer) so I contacted GoFit directly; my thought is that I would like to keep the board and not go through hassle of returning it with DVD to Amazon, just to get a new DVD. My hope is that GoFit would agree to send me a new DVD. Well, I contacted the company through their website, and called their customer service line (did not receive a 'live' person, even though it was during normal business hours, so left a voice mail message). That was over a week ago and no one from GoFit has contacted me. Anyway, I like the board but very disappointed with GoFit customer service. Will not buy a GoFit product again."
3,"Board's fine, DVD's not","The wobble board is well contructed, no complaints there. However, the instructional DVD was defective and an e-mail to the company went unanswered. I'd think twice before ordering from them again."
5,Funny,I think House Of Payne 4 was the best of all. Great Stories and more humour and has not lost its message.Great ending to the series.
5,"""STILL HILARIOUS EVEN WITH SEASON 4""","""THE HOUSE OF PAYNE"" is back with the 4th season.Keeping you in stitches *Tyler Perry* decided to do it again.Keep The Laughs Coming TYLER!!!!!!!"
1,house of payne,i have just received my DVD and the package is rattling and it still has the plastic on it. What do I did? Do i send it back? do i check it out then if damaged send it back? Help me please!!! this is the first time this has happen.
1,Received in poor condition,2 of the discs I received were in poor condition. I thought I purchased this new. One disc had scratches on it the other was warped. As for what I could watch I enjoyed them but I think Tyler Perry is trying to include to many different people in the episodes.
3,Not what I expected,"I guess if you are looking for a two piece cake pan this is the one for you. However, the description did not state that this is a two (2) piece pan. I was looking for a 1 piece pan"
1,angel food pan,I sent this as a gift to a friend looking for a one piece angelfood cake pan. There is nothing in the description telling you it has a removable insert which is why I sent it to her. What a disapointment. They should revise the description to include the fact that it is a two piece pan
5,Great for the initiated!,"Like the other reviewer implied, don't buy this book if you just want a quick peek into the lives of 2 English queens. This book is more appropriate for people well-acquainted with the subject matter. The book is really well-written and will be a great source for history students for years to come."
2,Esoteric Commentary about Other Manuscripts,"I love history, especially stories of great movers and shakers, men or women. I read many scholarly books and historical novels. I really looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, it's NOT about Emma or Edith at all. It's an esoteric commentary about various versions of manuscripts written in the 11th Century and copied later which happened to mention Emma and Edith. It gave detailed comparison of each version of the manuscripts and compared the various perspectives of each author and their political agenda. It had little to do with Emma or Edith. It's like reading a book titled ""Eleanor Roosevelt"" but it's actually about all the books written about Eleanor Roosevelt which compared the virtues of these books but said very little about Eleanor Roosevelt herself or her life. Very Disappointing indeed!"
4,tom tom ext antennae,nice product. finally something that is realtively inexpensive that actually works. takes less time to pull in a signal now. and the wire is looooong. i guess that helps it pull a signal. pretty good overall.
5,TOM TOM PRODUCT,THIS ANTENNA THAT I RECEIVED WAS UNAVAILABLE ANYWHERE ELSE AND i WAS VERY PLEASED AT THE RATE OF TIME IN WHICH I RECEIVED IT .THANK YOU SO MUCH
3,Worth a read - a decent 20th century academic work,"This book gives a close analysis of Blackburn's 19th and 20th century trade union history, and contains many examples of statistics which local historians will find useful. However, the chapter covering the town's earlier history is weaker and contains some small but irritating inaccuracies. My advice? Read it for the later insights - don't use it for industrial archaeology!"
4,great pan - hard to season,"These Viking stainless pans are wonderful in some ways. They have flat bottoms which are essential on a flat ceramic cook top. You really do cook in less time, using less water and heat. However, they are very hard to season and I had to try two different methods. Adding more oil than normal at the beginning of cooking, heating that and then adding the food works very well.I have not tried the really expensive ""waterless"" 5 or 7 layer stainless pans, but for the price I think these Viking pans are excellent if you are willing to take the extra time to initially season them, plus the extra time it takes each time you wash and dry them to keep them looking nice and shiny.If you have been using non stick cookware for several years as I did be prepared to learn how to cook all over again. Once you do, you will be very pleased with the pans and know that you are no longer eating chemical coating with your food."
3,"Interesting, but not indispensable","This wraith book have a lot of ""technical"" information about hierarchy, inlcuding politics, bureaucracy, and military knowledge but seems like if you were reading a technical geographic book sometimes. The information contained is clearly useful and it is interesting to have this book in your wraith collection, but need not be one of the first to be purchased."
4,Well worth a read,"As a Christian I think this issue cuts fairly deep. If nothing else, read this book to become informed about the issue.I read the book hoping the answer to the question to be ""no"", but I believe there exists a distinct possibility of destroying a fertilised egg (the earliest stage of conceived child). I have not been able to refute this finding following my own further investigations. I challenge you to read every OCP product/medical information and definitively prove that there is not even a chance of ""preventing a newly created being- a blastocyte- implantation"".A life is a life, no matter how old she is, is your 3 month old niece any less a person than your 83 year old grandma? So too should a 3 day old conceived child be just as human as a 37 week old fetus."
1,skeptic,"It is ALWAYS in a religion's best interest to keep their women pregnant, no matter what you have to write to get there. This book is not thorough or scientific enough and NFP is not reliable enough. Women not in control of how often or how many pregnancies they have are treated like brood mares in order to create more worshipers to brainwash. That some women don't understand that this is a power grab by their churches' (male) hierarchies' interest in increasing their populations and the fact that they treat men as their final authority on the subject is disturbing, to say the least."
4,Mrs. Estronsky and the UFO,"I truly enjoyed this book. I found the characters warm, funny and believable. I loved the relationships between Jackie and her mom, and Jackie and her friends. And was saddened by the distance between Jackie and her dad and brother. The family stuff was really good.Being a UFO believer, I was very jealous of Jackie's experience! This was a very exciting scene!!This is a really good young adult book and I recommend it to kids of all ages."
4,Takes Me Back - Great Story!,What a great story that took me back to growing up...well written...great details that make the story all the more real and enjoyable! Hope there is another book following.....
1,Outdated and amateurish.,"I'll be brief, since this film (at just under 2 hours) wasn't.The film was stultifyingly boring in its narrative, amateurish in its acting and production values, and grossly offensive in its outdated, stereotypical depiction of the homosexual protagonist as a socially defective sexual (and sexless) predator.Do they not have professional actors in Czechoslovakia? Professional writers, diretors, or cinematographers?This film is an udder zero. (Cow joke.)"
2,"boring and slow, not worth watching","This film is not worth watching, as it is not written well, the characters are not well developed, and altogether it does not hold your attention.I turned it off after a whole hour of waiting for something interesting to happen.What also got me T.O.'d was a quite graphic scene of a dead baby-cow. Unnecessary.It is not the worst movie ever, but I'd say, find something else to watch.A great movie from the Czech Republic is 'Kolya', for instance. 5 stars out of 5 for Kolya."
5,perfect fit,"My son loves this, he has a Mazda Miata. This fits perfectly, nice and thick and stays on even in the wind!"
4,Great for the price.,I heard about this at a class I went to for mixed media journaling. A woman told me that they work great and are so much cheaper then the ones in the art stores. I ordered them and having been using them for months. They have alot of pigment in them and they last a long time. I will always included these in my art kit going forward.
4,water soluable oil pastels,"These are the creamiest smoothest pastels, easily blendable with a delicious texture. the only negative to it is they changed the color of red-violet from the rich, bright, gem tone that it used to be, to a duller, more subdued tone, which does not jump off the page like it used to. i was very disappointed by this, actually. The red-violet was my favorite color and i used it for so many of my paintings. now i have to go to the trouble of attempting to mix to try my best to match the original color. all in all, a great tool, beautiful colors, and smooth as cream!!!"
5,Great book! (I think),"Sadly, I've never read this book. On a better note though, it is by Dr. Blackman, which means that it must be an exceptional book. If I had the patience to read an entire book, I would probably enjoy reading this one. Anyway's, I think you should read this book, even though it is a special order and may take a few weeks to arrive at your doorstep."
5,Fabulous,This piece of cookware is my all time go to..I have other pieces of Calphalon but always go to this.
2,Not very happy with it,The size was perfect. But food sticks to the bottom of the pan and is not too easy to clean either. I prefer a non-stick pan to this.
5,a classic!,"Back in 1983 (if you can believe it), I bought a used Casio SL-300 in a suburban garage sale... I had never heard of, nor seen, a solar powered anything... I thought it was miraculous! Those were the days of big lunky Texas Instrument units that took batteries. Today, I was just doing a search to see if I could find the original on the internet, and I see they're still making it, with only minor design modifications.I still have it, and it still works. How can I ever get rid of it? I swear, this is the most reliable electronic gadget I've ever seen. Can you believe a 20 year old solar calculator still works? Shocking!"
5,Must read this book,"I tell you all, read the Apprentice Adept series. It is wonderful. P. Anthony created two worlds that are the same yet totally opposite in which a man, a serf, named Stile has to save his life with the help of a finely crafted, beautiful female robot named Sheen. Stile crosses from the science frame (Proton) to a world of magic (Phaze) in order to escape the threat on his life. However, in Phaze, the threat still follows him. Stile gains special magic powers in Phaze that help him and he also meets some new friends, a unicorn, a werewolf, a beautiful woman called the Lady Blue, and a vampire that helps him defeat the threat. But the problem is solved yet; Stile has to save Phaze and Proton from destruction. A wonderful Sci-Fi/Fantasy novel Anthony-style."
5,The Land Was Theirs: Jewish Farmers in the Garden State.,"Gertrude Dubrovsky is the leading scholar of what is a very neglected field, the history of Jewish Farming. ""The Land Was Theirs"" is a comprehensive history of what was the Cradle of the Jewish farming movement, New Jersey.Between 1880 and the Second World War, tens of thousands of Jews set up farms in southern and central New Jersey. The adventurous Jews, most of whom were recent immigrants, set up private farms but also established cooperatives and unions to help one another. They lived in tight-knit communities based on ethnic identity and often ideology. ""The Land Was Theirs"" focuses on Farmingdale , NJ, where Dubrovsky grew up but is also a rigourously researched history of farming in the entire state. The introduction includes what is one of the best essays on Jewish farming in the entire country. A must for anyone interested in this overlooked part of American Jewish history."
2,JUST A COLORING BOOK,"I knew it was a coloring book, but I thought that it would have some instruction on creating mandalas. I probably will never use this book, once I reviewed it the first time. Very disappointed."
5,Adult Coloring! How Fun!,"I've always loved coloring. As my children aged, the opportunities for coloring decreased. Now I can blissfully color while being open to the inspiration that may come from the beautiful Mandalas."
3,Great coloring book,Great coloring book. The mandalas are beautiful. The first book gives more descriptions of the history of mandalas. The book is spiral bound which makes it easier to color in.
5,Beautiful,"Sometimes even as an adult I enjoy coloring wether with crayons or colored pencils, it is very theraputic, and your able to focus on something else for a while. This books illustrations are very beautiful, but you have the opportunity to use the colors you want, and on actual white paper instead of the off white-ish color of childrens books. It helps to have the spiral bound, I do have a few others without the spiral bound but this just makes it easier and more comfortable. It is like making your own stained glass pictures."
4,Exactly what I needed,"This, and other books of hers are great for coloring mandalas. I purchased to make copies of to take on the plane for my next trip and have something relaxing to do rather than reading another book or watching the boring movies. They are a little too big to copy onto 8 1/2 by 11 paper so just deal with it and have some of the edging cut off. I use colored pencils and pastels on them. Very excellent tool for grounding you and creating a peaceful loving experience."
2,a little disappointed,"This book is good, but most of the designs are very simple and broad, which is great for shading, but I prefer more detail. If you are looking for more detail try Dover's coloring books, they make soo many great ones and have one called Mystical Mandala which is only $4 and has so much more detail. One upside for this book, in comparison, is that the designs are not on both sides of the page (as they are in dover's) but this is not enough of a problem to keep me from choosing dover's version over this one. While this book was not horrible, I will admit that I get bored while coloring in it, and frequently leave designs unfinished because I dont enjoy the material very much. As far as meditation with the Mandala aspect, I find that for me, all coloring is a form of meditation."
5,"""I am the Doctor.""","Fans of the series, fans of Jon Pertwee's Doctor, or even to Jon Pertwee's other work are owed this volume from the Handbook series by Virgin Publishing. Like all of the books before it, it goes in depth into not just what and how (the late) Pertwee acted in ""Doctor Who"", but as well, much of the background info, behind-the-scenes, etc. which are a fan's necessity. Not only do I recommend this non-fiction paperback, but all the others in the series (there's seven altogether)."
2,Americana Big Wheel - Just Spinning Not Moving,"I was able to put it together without any difficulty. However, I was disappointed in the quality - it is all plastic and the front wheel tends to just spin without griping the surface. You have to give it push from behind or the rider just sits and spins. We tried it on a concrete side walk, a black top driveway, and on hardwood floors with the same results of spinning without moving. I probably would look for another brand next time."
2,Not the usual Michener book,"This was not a novel about a place/ time or even really about Mexico. It was really about the writing process and how serendipity sometimes changes everything. It was good for what it was but for Michener fans craving more along the lines of Hawaii,Chesapeake, Covenant this will dissappoint. It is much closer to Iberia - my least favorite Michener."
3,Interesting,"This book is an essay on how Michener wrote the book ""Mexico"" over a 20 year period. It gives insight and you get to meet characters that never made it to the finished work, but it is a bit of a slow read, even for a guy who loves Michener."
4,Very involved and challenging,"I purchased Richard Freeman's Primary Series at the same time I purchased David Swenson's Short Forms. I am not sure I will ever attempt to go beyond the Short Forms practice, but I am impressed with this DVD. If you are a VERY SERIOUS ashtanga yoga practionier, then this is for you. Richard Freeman's experience and ability are inspiring and amazing."
3,Ashtanga Yoga: The Primary Series,"It was very detailed, but a bit on the dry side. The narration lacks energy, but the poses are executed well."
2,Wow Crazy Hard,"The poses in the latter half of this tape are incredibly advanced. I laughed out loud when the instructor said it might take ""a few weeks"" to master one of the poses that, to me, is near impossible. A few decades more like it. No music also made it very boring to me."
3,"Not what I was expecting, I think.","I'm not quite sure what I was expecting when I ordered this dvd, but it was way more advanced than I expected. I've never taken a formal yoga class, as they just aren't easily found where I live. I enjoy yoga, but this was way more than I planned on biting off. First of all, it is two hours. I don't know too many people that have two hours to dedicate per day to any work-out. Second, some of the poses are far too advanced to do at home, unless you have had a great deal of personal instruction. I was a bit scared to try some of the poses for fear of hurting myself. For crying outloud, this man is Gumby. There should be a disclosure that this is for advanced yoga students, not beginner or intermediate. And frankly, it's a bit creepy."
4,"Extraordinary, but . . .","Max Cencic certainly had one of the most extraordinary voices among the many outstanding Weiner Sängerknaben soloists, but those who love the sweet, reedy quality of the treble voice may find this boy's voice not sufficiently boyish. Cencic's voice was more like that of an adult female soprano than like a boy's voice -- powerful and completely under control.Be that as it may, if you happen to collect recordings by boy sopranos, this one certainly belongs in your collection -- and if you just happen to like the music on this CD, you won't be in any way disappointed with its performance."
5,Wonderful,"This is the best lipcolor. It's my go to lip treatment. I buy it year after year and Amazon.com is the only place I can find it. It isn't a lipstick or a lipgloss, it's the best of both worlds. A beautiful sheer color- no matter what color you choose. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Today I boughtRevlon LipGlide Sheer Color and Shine, Sheerly Strawberry 090, 0.06 Fluid Ounce (1.9 ml) (Pack of 2)"
5,Great Music,"Old memorys at high school.Must listen to music,recommend to others !Circus Disco 25th AnniversaryThump N Disco Quick Mixx"
5,wow cut glass has my fav disco song on here,a rare find indeed WITHOUT YOUR LOVE by cut glass is my fav disco song have never seen it anywhere except on this cd i purchased it today
3,Disappointed expected more from Davy's story,"I love Shannon Mckenna however I was very disappointed in this follow up to the McCloud brothers. I absolute could not stand Margot I found her annoying and trashy and that left me questioning Davy's judgement in women. I envisioned a much more evolved woman with class for Davy much more than the hey dude nympho, fighting, no home training sleaze like Margot. The fighting was not sexy just annoying and no way to highlight love. The dress up at the final show down made no since what so ever to me and having a quickly in a hotel room that Margot was tied up in and almost died in with the mantic psycho still running around outside made no since either. I hope Sean's story will make up for this let down."
2,Dumb and Dumber...,"I think she kinda over did everything here and just ruined the whole story.Her witty writing style went too far and made her H/H seem dim witted. I kinda got sick of phrases like .. "" Like duh..""... "" ah duh.."".... If you're into high school language spoken by 30 year old heroines and a 38 year old hero, this book might be for you. However, most adults will feel their brain cells dieing from reading this novel.As for the love scenes, I truly enjoyed her ""other"" books, most of them were filled with passionate, erotic and yet tender love making. In this book however, too much talking takes place that distracts and annoys the reader. It was just way too irritating, the whole story, the characters, the bimbo'ness of every character....... it was like.. erm reading about a desperate 16 year old valley girl from California in lust with a 18 year old surfer dude... "" like duh!~""Do try reading her other books first, this one was a disappointment."
3,A THRILL A MINUTE - LITERALLY!!!,"Picked this up in the Mystery section at the library. Got more than I bargained for. Hot, Hot, Hot! Oh yeah, the mystery was good too.Male and female leads were both strong. Bad guys were vile and vicious. This book was action packed and I barely remember my plane ride!!!!! I must look for more of Ms McKenna's books. :D"
2,Couldn't finish this,"I found the story's dialogue and Margot really irritating. I was about half done before I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't mind ""Behind Closed Doors,"" but I don't think I'll be buying anything by this author again. I couldn't finish ""Hot Night"" either."
1,IRRITATING READ,"This book is far from romantic or erotic. There were too many sex scenes & at such ridiculous moments that it totally took the thrill out of their perilous situations. The sex scenes were so rough & lacking in tenderness that they appear to be quite brutish. Davy & Margot were such unlovable characters that I did not really care what happened to them. Davy's behaviour appears to be borderline abusive. I won't be surprised if he ends up being a wife basher. The only saving grace is Mikey. This was a very disappointing read from the author of the superlative ""Behind Closed Doors""."
1,Boring,"I could not get into this book at all, I found it really boring, I agree with the other review that said it was irritating. This is the first book I have bought that was written by this author and it will definitely be the last one. I have to say it was the worst book I have read in a long time."
1,The Mccloud Brothers series.,"Well what can I say. I was very dissappointed in this series. If you want to read a book of nothing but sex and thats it then its for you. But if you are like me and enjoy a book with a story line and real charactors that keep you involved in the story and romance as a side then don't read this series, I read the first book and sent the rest back. I love to read books with romance but this was just plain stupid."
1,Gag!,"Amazon Books should be ashamed of itself! Listing ""Out of Control"" in the Thriller/Mystery categories is totally deceptive. If I had wanted quasi-porn, I would have searched the ""X-Rated"" category. I am a fan of the historical romance, but this book had no redeeming qualities. The lead characters weren't even attractive; simply two passive-aggressive losers. And the reader really had to be patient while waiting for a plot to develop among the sexual garbage. Gag!"
1,Was it written by the same author?,"I bought this book thinking I was going to get a great, intriguing story. I wasted money and time on this book. I didn't even read like it was written by the same author. This one is out of control. But in all the wrong ways."
5,EPIC.,"I just received this knife via UPS today and my goodness is it SHARP!In fact, it's almost SCARY sharp, and I love it.Immediately, without provocation, I had the urge to dice an onion and see how much my new toy improved my performance, and WOW was I being held back by inferior cutlery! This knife simply drifts through anything you put in it's way. I almost feel as if I'm only necessary for the guiding of the knife, otherwise it does all the work.If you are a home cooking enthusiast, I would greatly recommend the Shun Steel Series, you've got to love that one piece, seamless construction. Also, they mail in to you in a nice box but it is NOT SUITABLE FOR STORAGE!! Shun makes a sheath for under 15 dollars that is absolutely perfect if you are like me in being unable to afford a full set of Shuns worthy of purchasing a block for.I rate this knife a 5 out of 5, it has exceeded my expectations."
4,!!! HOW DIDNT THESE GUYS GET BIGGER THAN RON JEREMY ? !!!,"I BOUGHT THIS CD BRAND NEW FOR 2 DOLLARS SOLY BECAUSE I LOVE NIRVANA, AND THESE GUYS WERE ON SUBPOP. I GOT IT HOME, LISTENED TO IT FOR A MINUTE, GOT BORED, AND WENT OUT. A FEW LATER, I GAVE IT A SECOND CHANCE. IT REALLY GREW ON ME TO THE POINT WHERE I HAD TO PUT IT DOWN FOR A BIT CUZ MY WIFE WAS GETTING JEALOUS OF THE BOND BETWEEN THE CD AND ME. GOOD MUSIC FOR A LAZY DAY. I LIKE TO VEG OUT AND LISTEN TO THESE GUYS. IT DOESNT GET ME PUMPED, BUT IT DOES GIVE A HELLUVA LISTEN."
4,Tiny Tunes by Carole Peterson,"Two cuts on this recording are fabulous. ""Say Good Day"" features animal sounds and can be sung using any animals that ""talk."" ""Walkin' Shoes"" is a great activity song."
1,Very Upset!,"By reading the comments of others, I bought this CD to get ""I've got a Treat"" only to dinf that it not on the CD!!!! People should only write correct information and I would have kept my money!"
3,maybe my body isn't for these,"I got these to work out in, but probably would do better with a jock strap! They tend to ride up the rear. Maybe it's my body. I'm not trim like the model, but not truly 'fat'. Oh, well, lesson learned. Good ol' JC Penny or Kohl's brand probably do as well."
3,Fine but FOTL as good for less,"As I said in the heading, I have no complaints on these, they are just fine. However for a fraction of the price the 5 pack Fruit of the Loom Low rise briefs are as good for a fraction of the price. I can't say much more than that."
3,Swimmer,The low rise is only comfortable for Charles Atlas types. Jocky should make this product in a full rise model for those of us who are larger agound the waist.
5,fish oil snip tip capsules,"Excellent product, excellent price. Vendor was very quick in delivery. Absolutely no problems."
2,You Can't Trust Relatives!!!!!!!,"Karen was a girl who had been to no exotic places so when her so-called ""cousin"" Blanch nvites her to England saying her dad gave permission, Karen is extremely happy. The story is sizzling and exciting, the plot is unique, the escape is strategically planned. I was kept in suspense till the last page."
4,a good one,A very good book. Better than Nancy Drew's to my opinion my hypothosis to what was going on changed continuesly and finally at the end I settled on one. It also teaches alot about London and such. The book isn't that far out of real life so it could really happen which to me makes it all the better. A good book.
1,Rent only if you like gross humor,"You know I expected so much more from the creators of ""American pie"". That was at least funny. I personally do not think watching a woman wipe semen off of her leg and then gargleing it. Or listening to a guy who is sitting on the can with diarreha funny! And that pretty well sums up this movie. If you like the aforementioned stuff in your movies, then knock your socks off and rent. If however, you are like me then you would do best to avoid this. Try super bad. That one was good as well. this one not so good."
2,crude humor,"this is disgusting. if you are into crude humor, this is for you. it is really feral. though the end few minutes are ok. Brenden f was good. chris kline is his usual devoid of talent."
5,Exactly as described,It's hard to find colored masking tape that is sturdy and does not tear into odd strips.This tape is easy to use and is exactly as described.
1,Masking?,"I had a terrible time getting this tape off the roll. I almost returned it but in the end decided it was too much trouble to return, so I kept it. I sould not buy it again."
4,Good on glossy surfaces,"Very useful, but it seems to have a bit more adhesive than I'm use too. If applied to matte wall paper, it may tear the wallpaper. Although when applied to a glossy surface (eg. window sill, glossy paint, etc.) it peels away fine and leaves no residue."
1,very thin and cheaply made,This tape is thinner and far less effective than even plain scotch tape. It tears easily in hand like paper and is practically worthless as a lasting adhesive device. Can only be used as temporary marker. Completely not what I expected .
2,Bayless falls short of former books,"Rick Bayless knows a great deal about authentic Mexican cooking. This book, however, reads like an edited version of a TV introductory cooking show (which it probably is). His former books introduce the cooking of Mexican and Oaxacan cuisine with admirable quality and depth.The book is primarily basic corn kitchen and a few standards. Consisting of, essentially 34 recipes with two or three variations on each, the book is far less than it appears.He has some good sections on ingredients, but rarely complete: for example he has a section on tequila which never mentions pulque or mexcal (from his beloved Oaxaca) and while he calls for such things as avocado leaves and epazote he does not provide a source. On the other hand, he has a good section on internet resources."
5,¡Buen Provecho!,"This book is truly passionate about Mexican food. And for good reason because true, authentic Mexican food is among the world's greatest cuisines.The book is centered around a few traditional dishes (or plates). Each one covers how to traditionally prepare the dish (with some allowances made for the conveniences the modern kitchen provide) as well as a few more modern (but still in the spirit) variations. There are plenty of mouth watering pictures (so mouth watering that I wished for more). My only complaint...maybe there could have been more recipies - there are 3 other books by Bayless, though, to fill the gaps.I found the Chili rellenos and Cochinita pibil to be to excellent and easy to recreate (though rellenos are time consuming).If you haven't seen the PBS series, check that out also. The book makes an excellent companion."
4,Great cook book!,Purchased for a gift but now want my own copy! Kind of a bummer that there are very few photos but still a delicious refrence for authentic style mexican recepies! Great deal!
5,"Really delicious food, really easy to follow instructions!","Although not all the meals in this book are whip it up quick, EVERYTHING I have tried so far has been simply spectacular (And besides, true art takes time!) If you love traditional Mexican dishes, and recipies that have it all explained for you, I strongly reccomend this cookbook!!Not only are the recipies filled with tips for success, but each section has a wonderful narrative on the history and the origins of the foods on the following pages!My Husband always exclaims ""Wow! this is JUST LIKE my Grandma used to make!!"" even if it is my first attempt.Again, easy to execute instructions and wonderful results have made this my favorite cookbook, complete with chile-splattered pages!"
4,Great learning tool!,"Living in Southern California, I've been seeking traditional recipes for those dishes I've enjoyed at restaurants for years. This author makes the tradtional easy for those of us who weren't raised to make tamales or other mexican fare. Every recipe I've tried has been received with cheers by all. Cheers to Bayless and crew for an excellent book. Another interesting aspect of the book is the history behind the recipes. Gave me a new perspective on the dishes I've enjoyed for years."
3,Yummy but time consuming,"We love mexican food and heard rave reviews about this book. Be warned, though - you'll need some time to prepare most of these recipes. If you have time on your hands and want to prepare meals that are very authentic then this is a great cookbook. However, when it's 6:00 and you are trying to throw something together for dinner, this is not the cookbook to use. My other gripe is that he is very long-winded in his instructions. This lends to the authenticity of each recipe, but it can be hard to follow. Everything we have made has been delicious but we have learned to plan ahead!"
4,Wish I could give it a 5,"In typical Bayless form, this book is both well written and entertaining. The recipes I've tried are quite good, but my problem is in finding some of the ingredients. I live in Atlanta and we have a large Hispanic population, but even when I go shopping in the Latino neighborhoods and our rather excellent international farmer's market, some of the ingredients just aren't available. More ideas for ingredient substitutions, please. Still, with a bit of imagination, the recipes are worth the effort. I thrive on Mexican food, have several of Rick's books and this one is well worth the price of admission."
5,The best for us Mexican food lovers,"Bayless' books are always good, but this one seems made to help us home gourmets. He begins with the basic Mexican dishes (they are not the typical American Mexican fare, either) then gives a classical recipe, than some adaptations. His Shrimp Cervice and the CornFlakes Coated Snapper are out of this world.The genius of this cookbook is that it teaches us not only what good Mexican cooking is all about, but provides both foundations and building blocks for a lifetime of exploration into this wonderful cuisine which has just taken off in the past few decades. I'm sure this book will propel it into the 21st century."
5,I love this moisturizer!,I have very sensitive skin and so far this moisturizer has not made me break out. It is very light and has a nice light smell. I love it!
2,allergic to it,"i thought this is all natural... including the SPF's active ingredients... but then again, it's my fault for not paying attention. the smell is great and the texture is very light. i have super oil skin, so i like things that are moisturizing but not greasy. the smell is fine, not too strong. unfortunately i am allergic to it. i put it on before going out, went to BJs and went home. about an hour in between. my face turned completely red. not i wasn't sick or anything. i tried it again on my arm... yes, i am allergic..."
2,never again,"this product just did not do it for me. i had acne and a little but of an oily complexion. i remember the smell was just weird, not foul but not pleasant either. i remember the consistency being like a little gritty. it did not moisturize at all. i would slather it on but id still feel dry. i use it with the clarifying wash from the same brand, and was not feeling any of them. i threw both out before they were empty."
5,Don't lean to hard--,This toy is really cool. The music isn't typical annoying childrens music but don't let your kids lean to hard on the block or the sensors where you place the block will break. Why?? This is a childrens toy-- Shouldn't it hold up to a little pressure.
1,Not like the old model,"We own the old model of this toy and after seven years it has started not working correctly. So I decided to get another one. The new model is chintzy. The sound is computer generated and lacks the clarity and depth that the old model had. The base toy and blocks now have a cheap lightweight plastic feel. This model has three music style settings on the back instead of a place for cartridge, so it is quite limited. For the money, it just isn't worth it. Wish I could find a ""new"" old model."
3,Original is better,"I have the original where you can insert different cartridges it is the best toy my now 20year old ever had. I do not care for the new one it's smaller and only plays a set number of tunes that are built into it, as one of the other reviews states there is no way to contact the company for questions or comments. They had a great toy and now they have an average toy . I feel frustrated when trying to get in contact with them to ask if they are still making the old version and how I can buy them for upcoming baby showers"
4,Seems to be a hit!,"We bought this for our twin boys for Christmas and it has been a hit. They are 1.5 yrs old and they are very interested in how the blocks make music. they take them out and hold them to their heads to hear it, which is funny bcs now they think all their blocks should make music. I think this toy will be enjoyed for quite a while and was a good purchase. The only 'down' side is that it is so well built that the blocks have totally dented our coffee table as the boys have banged them down on it while playing."
4,Many years of fun,"My children and I all loved this toy. It was a great intro to music and the turning of each block makes for different musical results, which was good for holding smaller child's interest. The only con is that the blocks get lost easily. Although they always seemed to ""reappear"" it would be nice if they could somehow secure to their spot better. The cartridge feature was great too but after a few years it stopped reading. Even tho, the kids kept playing with it. I only threw it away when I couldn't find two of the blocks anymore and didn't feel it was worth replacing them."
5,A Great Help,"My weight loss buddy and I decided that weight loss is really a mental game and we needed a coach. This book really helps with that, giving daily gems to help us to face the mental challenges. We also LOVE her other book, Life is Hard, Food is Easy.Really, these are wonderful books that are helping us stay on track.Thanks a million, Linda!"
4,Good Dieting tips,"This book helps the dieter get through each day or hard moment. Each of the 100 tips is just 1 - 2 pages so it is easy to access and read. It is hard to come up with 100 good ideas for dieting, but Linda S has done it."
3,The Item is Okay,"The book is okay, but fails to take into consideration all of the variables involved in loosing weight. Would not recommend this book."
2,*I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS*,"OKAY, IF I HAD THE TIME TO WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING 24HRS A DAY I MAY HAVE TIME FOR THIS, BUT THEN I WOULD ALSO HAVE ENDLESS TIME TO WORKOUT AND NOT HAVE WEIGHT TO LOSE...WAY TO MUCH WORK!"
4,"Highly recommended, appreciate her approach","I thought this was a very good book, with quick, easy, practical lessons. I found it motivating and insightful. Not every lesson resonated with me and I found some of the examples to be irritating and irrelevant, but I'm only one part of her audience and I'm sure those lessons and examples spoke to someone else. As far as the lessons go, you can do as much or as little as you want with them. Some days, I wrote a lot. Some days I wrote just a few sentences. If I missed a day, I just picked it up the next day. If you can't commit to that, I'm not sure if you're ready to commit to long-term weight loss or maintenance. The most important lessons, I think, are around managing long term weight loss. It really is a rest of your life challenge!"
5,excellent,How I have searched for an organized way to get my eating habits under control. Here it is. In 100 days (one at a time) I know just what to do. I turn to the numbered day and follow the directions. This book gets you thinking about yourself and food differently.
4,Excellent example,"Lots of filler in this book, but, sprinkled through it are some nice tips. Also, the book is filled with excellent example pages of comic scripts. All in all a helpful book."
2,Keep baby bottles warm,This product would be great BUT it can catch fire/melt in the microwave. I love it when it's not on fire or melted. leachco products are MADE IN USA !!! yay !!! But this product has some serious drawbacks.
2,portable wipes warmer,"At first, I really liked this. But the more I used it, the less I liked it. It didn't keep wipes warm more than like 1-2 hours, and it was really bulky in the diaper bag. I eventually just stopped using it."
1,does warm worth a darn,"This item doesn't stay warm for more than 20 minutes! I bought it because of the good reviews, but then ended up going out and buying an electric wipes warmer."
3,Bottles?,Not sure how this can keep any bigger than a 6oz. bottle warm. It doesn't look very big. I'd love to try & purchase one.
5,Really Works!,"This product warms wipes perfectly! It's easy to use, and you can bring it with you anywhere. Great for cold, winter days."
4,Go Natural Portable Wipes Warmer,"I have used the Wipes Warmer for both wipes and to keep my son's bottles warm and it is FANTASTIC!!! I have 2 of these units, one I use for keeping the bottles cold, too. I definately recommend this to all mothers on the Go!"
1,Heating Pillow Melts!!!,"I was really excited when I purchased this item, especially since I had read such great reviews. Unfortunately my experience with the Warmer was not a great one. After only 4 or 5 uses it melted and I also has this horrible smell that came after micro waving and YES I did read and follow the instructions carefully. I even put it in the microwave for 5 seconds less than recommend.I am sure this would be a 5 star item if there where some improvements made to the heating pillow."
2,"Religious Theme Will Appeal to Some, Not to Others","I ordered this book several weeks ago, before the review alluding to the heavy Christian theme had been posted. I, too, wish I had had some indication of the book's very religious content. I think a statement on the back cover of the book best sums up what potential readers may want to know: I Can't Find a Heartbeat invites all who are grieving the loss of an unborn child to sit at the feet of Jesus and allow Him to heal your broken heart.I had a miscarriage several months ago, so naturally I could relate to Melissa's struggle to find comfort and answers. I just couldn't personally relate to the very religious journey she took in order to find both."
5,The Best of The Best,"Just be sure to buy this version (18 tracks) rather than what appears to be a very pared-down later issue (same cover, only about half a dozen tracks).This is by far the best holiday album I have ever heard. I am a double-reed player and I must take issue with the complaints about intonation and musicianship by the one negative reviewer on this page. The song selection, mix of secular and religious, mix of serious and light, mix of familiar/less heard - Good as driving music, gift wrapping, or sing-along. This is the Holiday CD I listen to year round. If you are looking for ONE CD to buy for the season- for your collection or as a gift- This is it!"
5,Great Christmas Album,"I've had this particular Canadian Brass album for so long that I have it on cassette! But it's become a classic family Christmas album for us. It's a great addition to any Christmas, especially as background music. It's very calming and just plain good. I can't imagine my Christmas without it."
2,You can find better,"Lousy musicianship here, frankly-- missed notes and poor intonation. I was hugely disappointed when I heard this album. Greatly recommend A Festival of Carols in Brass (Philadelphia Brass Ensemble) instead, which is pure joy for the listener."
5,Great!,"Anyone considering purchasing this, do it! Without it, my camera would only hold 14 high resolution pictures...With it it is able to hold 520. I highly recommend this product."
5,Just what we were looking for,"My 2-year-old daughter loves Dora and I wanted to get her a Dora doll for Christmas, but I didn't want yet another doll that talks or sings or needs batteries. This Dora doll fits the bill perfectly: she's soft and a good size for small hands, and she has nice yarn hair and a cute little backpack. No complications! My little girl loves her, and is playing with her as I type, as a matter of fact."
2,Didn't work at all for me...,"I bought this because of a wisdom tooth that's coming in, and I wanted something to protect it, and lessen the pain, but without the numbing effects of Anbesol. Sadly, the product didn't work at all for me...It comes with a measuring cap, with markings on it so you know when to stop pouring, and you simply swish it around in your mouth for a minute. It doesn't taste bad, it really doesn't taste like anything at all, and it's a little thick. (non-toxic too, if you swallow it) No numbing, no stinging, nothing.It's supposed to put a barrier above whatever in your mouth is causing you harm, so it can heal itself, much like a liquid bandaid... which is a great idea, but again, it didn't seem to work at all for me, and I still got some sharp pains from my wisdom tooth.Maybe you'll have better luck, but I wouldn't buy this again. Back to numbing Anbesol for me I suppose."
3,"I like the other Marriner recording a bit better, but this is ok...","This is a fairly decent recording, but it is not the only recording of the Brandenburg Concertos that Sir Neville Marriner's Academy of St. Martin in the Fields has put out. Personally, I don't like the fact that the recorders in the 4th Brandenburg Concertos are an octave higher than other recordings, which some people may find annoying. Also, this is not a complete set."
5,Essential reading in US labor history,"Comprehensive and carefully constructed discussion of labor relations in post civil-war US, leading up the Haymarket incident, and its aftermath. Surprisingly balanced, with discussions of how even the police officers involved did not benefit. Good for anyone interested in 19th century US history, Chicago history, and required reading on the US labor movement."
2,"Repetitive prose, interesting topic","As the previous 2-star reviewer said, it is an interesting topic. Unfortunately, the author tends to repeat details over and over in subsequent chapters. Had he excised them, the text would likely have been at least 50 pages shorter and flowed better. His need to repeat characterizations of events and descriptions of people took away from the narrative. It's unfortunate since the topic is more timely now than ever. Overall, a tough read to slog through."
4,Good Labor History,"If one is interested in the United States labor movement and interested in the city of Chicago, this book definitely is worth reading. While the author approaches his topic from an academic point of view, this doesn't keep the story from being interesting and (in some ways) surprisingly relevant to labor questions today."
3,Chill or not to chill,"Product is attractive and functional. Does keep beverages cool, but not cold. I use as secondary storage on my pation, and refill it from the refigerator for ease of use when outdoors."
3,"Not the best, reconsidering...",The software are not easy to comprehend and operate...also the not best teaching either...
5,Great CD,"I love German Christmas songs! This is a great purchase, with almost all songs I like. Miss Leise Rieselt der Schnee"
1,Didn't Work,"Though it smells nice and now takes up space on my counter, it didn't work for me as a yeast infection cure."
4,good medicine,This product cured my chronic yeast and bacterial infections. I used one part yin care and three parts water in a cup and soaked a tampon in it and left it in overnight. I repeated this seven times. If you are experiencing symptoms I would recommend seeing your doctor if you are not positive about what you have or haven't used one of those over the counter strips to find out what you have. I originally got this from my accupuncturist it works if you use it right!
5,good product,"good for dry skin, mix 50 percent with distilled water or spring water, refreshing for dry skin.."
2,Yikes!,The book has some good information. But his knowledge of the runes are way off and the Christian overtones just made me sick. Otherwise there are some good things to be read and learned from this book. Sometimes he can be a bit boring though.
1,Usual Tyson Fluff With No Substance,"Not a fan of this work. As a matter of fact, with the exception of Liber Lilith, I'm not a fan of any of Tyson's works. Definitely not what I'd recommend for any student. There are a few gems within this work, but the neophyte or new student wouldn't be able to separate them from the lumps of coal, which make up 98% of the corpus"
3,Big Mistake,"Whereas the book does give a general over-veiw of magick, it did turn me off to evocation many years ago. It was about seven years ago when I first picked it up, and I did read it throughly. However, Tyson's Christian veiw did speak out on his section on Evocation. I remember reading something along the lines of the pagan gods being nothing more than demons, and not to go anywhere near them. It was not until a year later until I figured out that it was just wish-wash that he had written. Outside of this section, the book is decent, but with a few more errors."
3,Comfortable flat,"I really like this flat but it runs a 1/2 size large,I bought these in my usual size 9 1/2 but should have bought them in a 9."
3,Where did these come from?,"The first pair that came to me were discolored, but a replacement was sent immediately. These were also discolored and lopsided.If the shoe comes in good condition, it might be alright.Nice imbedded platform and a cute style-but the leather Tuscany colored one (pretty color too) came twice to my door in defective condition.I like a great bargain. but not at the expense of quality.These seem to have been in storage way past their prime."
5,the most amazing album i've ever experienced,"This album was by far the biggest influence on my former band, Buzztown. I love this album!!! It was second only to King's X's ""Gretchen Goes To Nabraska"" album, and for me that says alot. The fact that the band broke up saddens me, but honestly the reason (Jeremy became a Christain) makes it worth the sadness... way togo Mr. Enigk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Good good good!,How it is I havn't heard of Sunny Day Real Estate until now is beyond my knowledge. Great Cd! Not only full of emotions but also has some great sound to it. Check it out!
5,You have to own this,"this is the start of an awesome band. They can do so much within one song, it will make your head spin. Their drummer is amazing, and while not as tastefull on this album as on later albums, he still shows that he is a genius. I can't stress how much listening to this CD has changed me as a musician. Buy this and LP2, the pink CD, and get started on the road to emo....."
1,slouching toward oblivion,Music without melody doesn't last.In short order this cd will jointhe growing trash heap of musicalhistory.
5,do not miss this!!!,"absolutely one of the most amazing cd's out there. sdre writes the deepest lyrics i've heard, and the music is beautiful without being wimpy. when i bought this cd, i hadn't heard anything by them before, and i was amazed. my personal favorites are pheurton skeurto, in circles, and song about an angel... but each song is unique and thought-provoking in its own way and i love every one. definitely buy this cd, it's worth it."
5,One of the greats..........,"This is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I listen to everything from jazz to classical to blues to rock....I love it all, and this stands atop the heap. I own all of their albums and each one is uniquely brilliant. This is their first album, so it's a good place to start. They call it emo-rock, but a label is but a limitation. I think any form of expression should be emotional, and these guys don't hold back. That is what makes good music."
3,Pretty good,"this album is Pretty good to me. I dig the drums&the Grooves. Hit&Miss on the vocals&songwriting but overal this Album has it's charms. ""In circle"",&48 are my cuts here. I tend to keep up on the Albums that dropped on Sub Pop Records espcially back in the day."
4,ahead of its time...,"I have recently stopped listening to EMO/scrEaMO and all the sub genres due to the saturation of self inflicted lyrics about the same old crap that are written by guys who should be to old to write about highschool romance. All opinions about EMO today aside I must say this album is awesome and gave me a listen in to what influenced so many bands. THe songs are heart felt and pure unlike stuff from today. Its amazing how much songs like ""circles"" sound like they could have been released today but are much more true to emotion without having to be blatant."
2,A very forgettable work,"Along with a handful of other reviewers here, I, too, cannot understand the fascination this album holds for so many other people. To me, this is SDRE's worst studio album. That's right, I even prefer The Rising Tide to Diary. Diary is just a mish-mosh of sounds; nothing gels; no melodies stick in my mind. I should probably give it a one, even. Diary is a very forgettable-sounding CD. I was completely disappointed with it, and puzzled at how so many people gush over this. Perhaps it is because my introduction to the band came with LP2. Then I bought How It Feels To Be Something On. Then I saw them play live on The Rising Tide tour. Then I bought The Rising Tide. In my opinion, if you want an SDRE album that represents their best work, get LP2 (the pink one) or How It Feels To Be Something On. These albums have great lyrics and great melodies that really stick with you."
2,I was expecting more!,"I thought they could do better than this. I guess I was fooled, but it's ok for a 1 time listen."
2,"This non interesting supposedly emo ballad, terrible",When listening to this album and reading the reviews at the same time...it's hard to understand why most would think this is the greatest album...but not one bit interesting that i can't get through one whole song...maybe you can hear some emotion in jeremy's immature vocals...or maybe there is rhythm in the confusing drumwork...But it's just soo hard to listen to when it doesn't even sound a bit...ummm...good. it's got potential for the next album that's it.
4,As Described,Exaclty as I expected. I didn't rate as a 5 because the dvd box was a little banged up. Quick shipping.
3,Get a magnifier glass,"The item arrived fastly, sealed, in perfect condition.The movie title is written in the inside rim of the CD, in very little letters. There are no images to identify one movie from the other.Playing one of them, it blacks in a couple of scenes. Haven't played the other ones yet."
5,Good old rock and roll.,"I haven't sat down and listened to this CD that much, but damn if its from the Reverend it has to be good. So just give up the 4 bucks and buy it."
2,puzzle master,"I have had puzzle master puzzles before and loved them. This one was notas good as the ones I already have. I would love to have more like the onesI have (2,3,4 and 6)"
2,Very disappointing,"In addition to requiring a $150 per hour computer specialist to load, the software removed the calulator function off my Blackberry.I'm sorry I bought it."
5,I sing for thee Hades....,"Aside from having some of my favorite covers in romance, P.C. Cast's stories are becoming my must-buys. Goddess of Spring, so far, is by far my favorite.How do you convince your readers to fall in love with Hades? Yeah, Hades. He's the hero. When I read the back blurb, I was really curious. This isn't the usual hero fodder. But, as I said, I love P.C. and I knew if anyone could pull it off, it was her.Goddess of Spring is about an Italian bakery owner -Carolina (Lina) - who, by mystical circumstances, trades places with the Goddess Persephone, who is being sent into the Underworld to ""vacation"" with the God Hades. Oh, what a hero! I sing for thee Hades. The colorful Underwold was beautifully done. It's impossible not to fall in love with this story."
4,Enjoyable,"This book wasn't perfect, but it was a decent story. For those of you expecting the classic Hades and Persephone, you will be disappointed. But if you set aside this expectation and settle yourself for a rather different take of the H and P story, then you should enjoy this. Ms. Cast has improved her writing since Goddess of the Sea, so this story is more fluid. This story was good for a nice afternoon read with a cup of tea, and many parts of the story were quite humorous and enjoyable. Again, don't expect classic H and p. This is very different, but I enjoyed it."
4,Goddess of Spring,"P.C Cast writes a good story; there's no way of getting around it. Her style is compelling, it's a very quick and pleasurable read and it's a 100% made for women series.That having been said, the sex stuff gets a bit played out and after a while you just want her to tell the story and get it over with. I got pulled into reading this after reading the ""House of Night"" series. That series was written for teens so the story lines were more PG. The up side to that was more story less sex stuff. Since I think her strong point is the story, it's a better series."
2,Hated this Book!!!!,"I have read a great deal from this author and normally I think her storylines are decent. She has great character development and the way she describes the breathtaking scenery is amazing. But this book... just made me angry. I have always wanted to read a book that had Hades as a character, just to see the different angles the author could have... But this was awful...She made Hades a sniveling little twit who might as well have been a virgin and who was riddled with compassion. I suppose that is what I get considering this is a romance book and someone would have to fall in love with him and vice versa. But still, this book was very disappointing..."
5,Goodness...,"This book is filled with so much goodness.P.C. Cast does not disappoint. Do not let the price tag fool you, this book is worth so much more than that. It is priceless.5 Stars. Experience it. Stop reading this review, and buy the book already!"
5,Loved this story!,"If you love reading about Goddess, love & magic read these books. I like how PC tweaks the myths & makes them her own. Hades is amazing & tall, dark & sexy & Lina makes for a smart, loving heroine & she's 43! Not a perfect 20 year old like in most books. I'll never think of the Underworld as a dark, dreary place again. So give them a try I'll think you'll enjoy them."
3,Another interesting book,"Wow, I really liked Hades, but barely cared about Persephone or the female lead character. I really enjoyed the descriptions of Hades and the interaction between the Greek pantheon, but the romance was tepid and uninteresting. A quick read but not a keeper."
1,mediocre,"This book has not made me a fan of P.C. Cast. I doubt I'll read anything else by this author. The writing was clunky and disjointed, the main characters were barely fleshed out in the most elementary of ways, and the sex scenes were laughably boring. Not worth the time I spent trying to finish it. Unless you enjoy mediocrity, I do not recommend this book."
1,Junkey junk!,"These ""Goddess"" book are idiotic and lewd at best. Of course many other women like soft-porn romance novels. Hopefully, some will be encouraged to read some good fantasy after reading these books. But if you haven't read them, don't bother. Really!"
5,goddess of spring,"I love this book it a fast read, its fun and entertaining. It has just enough sex in it to make it interesting, but not so much that I would let me 12 year old granddaughter read it. b"
2,Blackberry 7230,"I order a blue one and got a black one. Not to mention the ad said it would work with ATT you must of ment contract. I am kind of dissatified, but I will keep it becuase it was a birthday present for my husband."
4,Sprinkles Musical Giraffe,My friend purchased this toy for her daughter. Her daughter liked the toy. It was nice and soft and the music was not too loud.
3,This was a birthday gift for my Mom,"She loved it! My mom is in love with giraffes.. I run out of stuffed girraffes to get her. Every birthday I send her a stuffed girraffe, Which I was told by my little sister she keeps in her living room on shelves.. My mother said it is absolutly adorable, and she loved that it plays music. She said it's really soft.. It is really cute, Although I know most people don't buy these kind of things for adults.. but it worked for my mom. My mom also said that babys/toddlers (my kids) would love this one because it is so soft and plays a song.."
2,Didn't grow much this first year,"It still looks pretty much like the small plant that was shipped after being in the ground for over six months. Growth was minimal. Looking up the plant, it is supposed to take several years to start showing real growth so perhaps this is exactly as it is supposed to be but most plants show SOMETHING. It's still alive and healthy enough."
5,Great Lamp - great price,"I took this lamp to work to sit on my desk and add good reading light for documents and manuals. This lamp is perfect. It is well constructed, went together easily and looks beautiful. It is a nice, clean, classic lamp for my office."
2,Too small.,My husband thought that he was getting a longer knife from the description. This one is a hair too small.
3,I got this knife for pretty cheap,"The good:Comes quickrazor sharp from the boxblade material seems good qualityCheapThe ok:The handle is stiff, for plasticthe edge is ok, but more could have been taken to hone it from the factory. You can feel the edge burrsThe lock back seems to hold wellLightweightThe bad:The knife feels cheapopening the blade is not smoothNo clip, no studone metal rivet (blade hinge) the rest is held together by plasticI guarantee it breaks sooner than knives previousBottom line: it was cheap and it will do, and it has some good sides. 3.5 stars, rounding down."
3,Not compatible with GO 720,"Not a knock on the product, just an FYI: This won't work with a GO 720. It'll plug in, but doesn't pick up sound."
2,used better ones.,This product works good only if very close to mounth. with window open picks up so much noise that other person can not hear you.
5,Spartacus Season 1,Spartacus Season 1 arrived promptly and was exactly what I was seeking since I started into the series in Season 2 and liked it so much I wanted to get the history from the beginning. This is a great series...
1,"Over-dramatised, Silly Muck",The acting was somewhere between awful and terrible. It was over dramatised and silly with a story line that silly. It fake blood flew all over the place and made for a boring spectacle of ridiculousness. Some people may see this as just a bit of fun. To be fun it needs some substance and this lacked any. It was trying to be 300 and didn't even come close 300 had a story line and the flying blood contributed to the story. It was fun because it had substance and was well written. Don't bother with this nonsense!
3,Spartapus,"The fighting scenes are too slow and drawn out. It seemed like a very low budget adaptation of the movie ""300"". I loved the gratuitous nudity; I'm definitely a breast man. I purchased it without reading the reviews, and the show just didn't do it for me I didn't like any of the characters."
1,Pretty awful,"We loved Rome. This is like a cheap knockoff: bad acting, lack of substantial plot. Focus seems to be much more on blood and nudity. It honestly feels like you are watching a move in video-game format. We basically laughed at how ridiculous it was throughout the first episode. I plan to donate it without watching the rest."
1,300.... the series,"After watching the excellent BBC production Rome seasons 1 and 2, I decided to purchase Spartacus season 1. And I could not even make it through the first very terrible episode. Every single scene has this annoying 300 slow-down/speed up cheesy blood effect and the producers didn't even bother shooting anything on scene instead taking the lazy route and using CGI in every background. There was no outstanding acting like I would expect from something like this. The show was so despicable I ended up throwing the whole package out my front door. What a waste of money and time.Don't waste your time with this, either watch BBC's Rome series or watch the 1960's version of Spartacus instead. This is garbage."
3,Gore fans unite!,"The series is great with an amazing story but just a bit too much ""over the top"" gore for me. If you love blood and guts and raw slashing views of the internal human anatomy as well as feeling like your covered in blood... then this is the series for you!"
4,Dramatic!,Quite the dramatic series. It was hard not to watch the whole first season in one take. Looking forward to the next series.
5,Great Show,"I watched it every week on Starz. It is an awesome show. The DVDs came with some cool special features. And I got it on sale, with free shipping, so great value for an even better price! I'd definitely recommend this series if you're into some epic action and lots of scantily clad sexy people walking around! *wink*"
1,Spartacus,"We had enjoyed ""Rome"" and bought ""Spartacus"", but it is a disappointment. It is cartoonish in its production values, which might have been the way the producers wanted it to look, but it did not appeal to us. Also, far too much gore."
1,inferior,"I bought this expecting it to have the same craft as the ROME series. Bad decision. If you are into video games,and you like the 300 movie (yes, it's a movie, not a film), then you will like this series. The plot gets pretty repetitive. I finished my ironing without paying attention to the movie, and you still get the gist. I am appalled that this has 5 star reviews."
1,DEMETRIUS DOES DALLAS.,"When one of the series stars calls herself ""Lucy Lawless"" you know better than to expect a worthy remake of the Kirk & Kubrick klassik. In fact it looks like a Tijuana Bible adaptation of ""300"". No subtle imagerie here. Bodies explode as if they were balloons filled with blood; its contents gushing out like animated Rorscharch inkblots. To savor the moment, the action freeze-frames itself so you can see the carnage in all its gory. And when things get slow, there's always some complimentary never-too-unexplicit fornisessions among the cast.Not that it's all sex and violence. There's love as well. In its most tender dialogues, the faithful wife kindly tells her husband ""Go kill 'em all!"". He dutifully complies. Awwww..!"
1,Spartacus,"I wish I could write a review, but I can't because I never received my dvd! I will not shop thru Amazon anymore. They cannot guarantee you will get your product!"
4,Great show ! Bad packaging...,"Love the show and I wish Andy Whitfield the best in his battle with cancer. I will tune into the upcoming prequel shows. I hope when these new shows come to blu-ray they will rethink the packaging. The very act of ""pulling"" your disc from the cardboard sleeve is enough to cause minor scratching to the disc. Also the lack of the blue,Blu-ray logo on the cover did cause some confusion. Whoever approved the final design format should be voted of the island."
5,A series for the ages,"Great story line u can follow very easy, i felt i was watchin 300-Calicula-Gladiator at the same time, looking forward for season 2, hope the main character get well soon after the cancer treatment, so he can come back and production start soon.U can run but u can not hide."
5,combinación perfecta de acción y drama,"serial muy absorvente, llena de acción, intriga, mentiras, sexo,y drama.bien elaborada. efectos especiales diferentes, similar a la película 300.recomendable sólo para personas con criterio formado."
5,Kick's Butt,"Honestly I don't think there is anything more that I can say that hasn't already been said in the some 400+ reviews on this series.I initially requested the product on Vine, hoping that it would be something my husband and I could watch together. He couldn't be patient enough to wait on me to watch it though! And he hasn't stopped watching since! I've only been able to watch a few episodes, but it's great!Hopefully one of these days I hope to be able to watch it and catch up on all the other seasons."
5,"Epic Epic Epic, is there any better word than Epic for this series!!!","I love the series, i like the story line the Brutality and the action scenes and the nudity in my personal opinion is the best series right now in television, supass 300 the movie, is just Epic i suggest to not watch in from of minors, Sparticus is a master Piece series, evolve you in to the series, i am going to repeat the word is just EPIC."
5,One of the BEST series in a long time,"When I first started watching this series on Starz, I was totally blown away with everything about it...the fighting, the plots, Spartacus, the other characters...and, did I say Spartacus! Andy Whitfield's portrayal of this slave that rises in the ranks of the gladiators is flawless...he draws you into his story in a way that I've never experienced before. Everyone is perfectly cast in this story.I don't buy too many movies or series, as I can see most of them on Netflix...but buying this one was a high priority for me.It is very sad that Andy Whitfield had to quit the show because of his cancer. I pray that he gets well and can come back. NO ONE ELSE can play Spartacus as well as he does. He is Spartacus!"
1,Art-house style with gratuitous sex,"I'm not a prude, and have nothing against a sex scene that builds and fits the story and plot. However, I hate gratuitous sex, which I define as that which not only doesn't contribute to advancing the film, but acts as a distraction from the story. Spartacus: Blood and Sand takes every opportunity it can to show breasts, show complete nudity, and have explicit sex scenes that would earn an X rating anywhere else. The effect is to come off as very crude.As for ""Art-house style"", the show frequently represents a long duraion of time by showing the the main character running/fighting/etc. in place while running a film reel behind him. This could be done to speed along the show or to reduce production costs, but I got the sense that it was done for that art-house effect.All told - a very disappointing effort."
1,Porn and blood,"This show is nothing but a cover for throwing every naked woman they could get to sign their contract on tv. Even during serious conversations there are a dozen naked women dancing in the background and having sex every chance they get. When no one is having sex or stripping, there are gladiators Of course doing what gladiators do. Violence is expected, but honestly all the naked women make this little more than a man's masturbatory fodder rather than enjoyable historical fiction I was hoping for."
1,juvenile attempt to horrify,"the stop-action filming just to demonstrate spurting blood and decapitations,etc, detract and therefore negate the intended violence. Perhaps it is just a man thing, but this was just plain boring, somewhat like the offending repetitious dialogue in the Scorcese gangster movies."
1,dutch2much,Very disappointed. After unwrapping it find that it can not be played on Australian DVD system. Should be something on the web site telling people this. Then the return policy is to send it back in its original wrapping. But first you need to unwrap it to play it and find that it is not compatible with Australian players.
1,garbage,"if you are looking for things like good writing, good acting, respectable production value, and believable action sequences, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.what you will find here is nothing but terrible dialogue, pretty actors delivering some of the most stilted and awkward performances outside of a kindergartner's christmas pageant, bullet-time overloaded sword and sandals fight scenes, and softcore pornography.usually i'd tout the pornographic aspect of the series as a redeeming quality, but in this case, it isn't enough to make up for the deficiencies. in all, this is an even less intelligent distant relative of xena: warrior princess that takes itself far too seriously for its own good."
1,Stylized extreme violence.,"I am a middle-aged former military guy who likes quality movies, with a preference for action-oriented movies and war flicks. I watched the first 30 minutes or so and was pretty disgusted. It's stylized with slow-motion action to highlight sword thrusts and blood spurts. Blood appears to be added by computer to almost every scene, sometimes covering a good percentage of the screen. Worse than 300. This is not Russell Crowe in Gladiator or Brad Pitt in Troy. Don't buy."
3,"Great show if you're not too squeamish with violence, blood & guts","There's almost 200 reviews already, so there's really not much I can say that hasn't already been said.For the most part people will either love or hate this series. Both my husband and I enjoy it, however, I must say that the violence does get to me and I tend to cover my eyes in some of the more gruesome scenes. It is absolutely not something you watch when the kiddies are around - I'm sure it would cause nightmares for weeks.All-in-all it is an interesting, seemingly realistic series that has been very well done, albeit very violent and gory. If you're not squeamish you'll likely really enjoy it. If you are squeamish, you may still like it & just cover your eyes during gory scenes like I do."
5,Scholarly elements of the ancient world still visible,"This show succeeds in capturing the atmosphere surrounding the ancient games, albeit in a manner made comprehensible to the modern viewer. One experiences the full impetus of the horror and excitement. The set designs have been well conceived, as well as most of the costumes.However, the scripting is completely inaccurate in accordance with how people of the period expressed and conducted themselves, and historical accuracy has been ignored. The show does however, possess a quality of its own.The plot is a good reconstruction of events in Capua in light of historical sources relating to Spartacus' time spent there being non-existent.Definitely a worthwhile watch!"
5,A good gift.,Thiis was requested by a family member and she was thrilled to have it. It arrived on time and I was very pleased.
5,Bought as a gift for my son,He really enjoyed this and the other ones that we purchased for him. I am sure he recommends this show.
5,Three Letters...,"OMG! Yep, that about sums it up. omg, omg, omg, omg, omg, omg, omg, omg, omg,, omg, omg, omg, OMG!"
5,"Great series, starts off a bit slow","I found the over-the-top CGI effects (blood, gore, etc) rather off-putting. As I recall, it was almost enough that I stopped watching after just this one episode. Luckily for me, I continued with the series. Episode 2 is a bit slow as well... but episode 3 and beyond (including the pre-quel Gods of the Arena and the sequel Vengeance) are right up there amongst the best TV series I've ever watched. The supporting cast shines, especially Lucy Lawless as Lucretia and John Hannah as Batiatus."
2,Spartacus 1st season,Major scratches on first and second disks so large chunks of the disk is unreadable. I would think twice before buying again.
5,W0W!!,I LOVE THIS SHOW AND HOPE THERE ARE MANY MORE SEASONS. THE ACTING AND STORY LINE WAS GREAT. IT WAS HARD TO WAIT FOR NEW SHOWINGS ON FRIDAYS. I WATCH EACH WEEKS SHOW SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE WEEK. THE CASTING WAS SUPER AND IT WAS A GREAT BALANCE OF LOVE AND HATE. STARZ THINK YOU AND GET YOUR WRITERS BUSY ON FUTURE SHOWS OF SPARTACUS BLOOD AND SAND. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THE DVD'S. I WILL MISS THIS SHOW UNTIL IT RETURNS NEXT SEASON.
1,Unable to watch.,Three out of the four disc were so degrated you could not watch them. They would stop and cut off .
2,cracked disk,Disk 2 had a crack on edge and made 2 episodes nearly unwatchable. Said like new-NOT as written in ad.
2,Kool Aid and Sand,"The CGI blood looks like Kool Aid. Seriously, these are some of the WORST CGI effects I have ever seen. The fights get sort of cool, then, splash - a fountain of blood that actually made me laugh instead of getting thrilled. At least this is one less series for me to buy/follow."
3,Spartacus,"I expected more, the acting was good, but the filming was poor and there was a lot more sex and nudity than there need to be. I know this was the way it was then, but showing that the sexual event happened and then moving along with the story would have been better."
2,Not The Best Quality DVDs,"I love the series, I don't love the DVDs. For me it's a bit tricky to return them and have them replaced, so now I'm stuck with DVD's that get stuck here and there, jump parts and an Episode 8 I can't see at all. Not a happy camper here!"
2,Pure Porn,"I expected way more from this series, It was just an Xrated movie, with about the same story line. Could have been done easily in 1 1/2 hrs. I have ""Game of Thrones"" season 1, and even though I have read all of the books published so far, and have given up on the author. It is a 10, and Spartacus is a 2, don't waste your money! Even the sex is tedious. The acting was good considering what they had to work with. The scene sets were terrible.Enough said, don't waste your money."
2,Soft Porn,"I am only writing this review as a warning to parents. Surely you already know that there is violence, blood and carnage in this series, but before you buy it to watch with your family, you should also be aware that there is so much nudity and explicit sex that it must be labeled ""softcore pornography""."
2,No Spartacus,"Although, the actors are tremendously talented, it's simply not my cup of tea. I'd rather watch reruns of Sanford and Son.I'm not quite sure why I even bothered. I ""donated"" the DVD to my co-worker. He was quite pleased."
1,disk problems,on this blu ray set the third disk refuses to read on my blu ray player. i have bought many of this same item and still to no avail. all i want is spartacus on blu-ray with all disks working.
1,"Cheese, poor FX, & more cheese","Was hopeful for this, and the first :30 seconds weren't bad, then entered the cheese dialogue, poor special FX, and then more cheese dialogue. We couldn't even finish one episode."
1,Spartacus,"I gave this item a rating of a 1 because the second disc, the 6th and 7th episodes did not play all the way through, the 6th started a 30 mins into it, and the 7th played about 30 mins then stopped."
4,Very Cool,"I enjoy watching this show. It's a bit on the dirty side, nudity wise, than what I'm used to watching. But then again, the Romans weren't a chaste people. The violence is to be expected since it is about gladiators after all. Look forward to see what the writers will do with the story when the main actor is well enough to continue. We all know Spartacus is supposedly killed, but the body was never recovered. So will the writers make him secretly escape, or let it remain a mystery? Considering how disgusting the Romans are and how they treat their slaves, the viewer can only hope that some of the slaves escape the perversity and enjoy some portion of their lives."
4,It took me to the third episode...,"I just spent the last two days watching the series from beginning to end. I heard good things about it, and found it on DEEP discount at a used DVD store.While I like visually-stylized things, the style of the series seemed over-done in the first couple episodes. I was getting incredibly bored with the constant punctuation of epic blood splatters, hyper CGI, slow motion, etc. But I stuck with it because I paid for it...And I'm glad I did.I'm only giving it four stars because I pretty much hated the first episode. Yes, I know the style was meant to look like a graphic novel (which I actually did NOT know before I started watching). I'm not offended by cursing, but at first the use of cursing seemed more gratuitous than honest.Once the series got into the meat of the actual story past just splattering the camera with blood, I really liked the series."
5,Amazing!,"First of all, to those who grumble about historical accuracy - seriously?!?! Does anything about this show suggest that that was the aim? Secondly, wow, this is probably the sexiest cast on television. Ladies, if you've been waiting for a show full of (gasp) male eye candy, here it is! Thirdly, it's a good story featuring some great performances. It's just sad that Andy Whitefield won't be back for season 2, as I'm having a hard time imagining anyone replacing him........."
5,BLOOD AND GORE GALORE,"Blood and gore with lots of guilt free sex set in a Rome that was heavily influenced in some ways by HBO's ROME. Don't worry about the History and names because most of it is off. Costumes and sets are well done but the focus is on the gladiatorial ring and the glory that comes with it set amongst intrigue, hate, fights to the death and, oh, didn't I mention sex? Overall, a fun series if you like the said focuses. Acting is a lot better than expected; good but not great but still better than you would expect.STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: B plus; GORE GALORE: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: Jan. to Feb. 2011; MY GRADE: B plus to A minus."
4,Great Series,"I would definitely recommend Spartacus to people who love action, drama, and intrigue. You will immediately be drawn into the characters. It can be a little gory at times, but this is to be expected with material such as this."
4,Terrific Series,"Only took about 15 minutes to realize what a great series it was. We ordered the BR edition, we liked it so much. Right up there with Dexter, True Blood and Deadwood as far as quality and getting addicted to watching it.Spartacus: Blood and Sand - The Complete First Season [Blu-ray]"
4,"if you like roman things, this is for you","Hubby liked this dvd set. We had never heard of it because we don't have the channel on our cable. But we ordered it anyways because it sounded interesting and he likes this type of thing. It was great! Season 2, here we come."
5,Happy Camper,"Exactally what I wanted, came neatly packaged and ready to play. Look forward to doing business with them again.Thanks"
3,disk 1 did not play well on new player,"I will be exchanging my copy for a new one because disk 1 did not play well. Disk 2 had one glitch and 3 & 4 were perfect. I only have one blue ray player, so I did not compare in another machine.UPDATE: I did return the original disk set. The new set plays fine on all four disks."
3,Bloody Mess,"Well, I thought I was going to find a mini-series on par with HBO's Rome. Spartacus doesn't hold a candle to the Rome masterpiece. I found Spartacus to be a ""bloody mess"". Evey cut of the sword equaled a flash of red on the screen....made me sick. I didn't find the characters engaging. Though Lucy Lawless was excellent. The settings couldn't hold a candle to Rome. I know that a computer generated backgrounds for both but I enjoy the architecture, and splendor that was Rome. I watched all the episodes just cause I wanted to see how the season ended....more blood. I'd give it a C and wouldn't recommend it unless you like lots and lots of bloody gladiator scenes. Purchase Rome and enjoy the glory of it's age. Secondly, Andy Whitfield who does a really good job as Spartacus won't be in the pre-quill as he is ill....I wish him all the best for a good recovery."
1,Guilty TORTURE!,"If you like BLOOD, GUTs, bare butts and full frontal nudity! There's lots of them here....I fast forwarded through the entire season and can still follow the story. Enough said, any more will be giving the series undue reverence."
1,"Not for Christian's. BLOOD, GORE AND NUDE SEX SCENES, ENOUGH SAID!","Got this because we love history and romans etc, but was dissapointed in it and sorry I chose it. Way too graphic and this takes away from what little story line there was. More for a violent typical man's taste, but I guess some wome will like this since the guys in it are really buff. Not for me or any real Christian family."
5,Love It!!,Love this set and absolutely love Spartucus! It made me subscripe to Showtime all over again just so i can keep with the show!
5,spartacus blood and sand,"Spartacus, has always, it's the best T.V show ever... If you've never seen it, and you love action and trill, you should give it a chance. You Won't regret it."
5,Sacramentum Hladistorum,"Loved this series, i wish this was once every week. Perfect for grownups only, there is a lot of sex,violence and drama."
4,Spartacus Rocks!,"Great series for people who enjoy action and violence! Not very historically accurate, but a good watch nonetheless! Four Stars."
3,it was okay,I liked Andy Whitfield's acting and the story was good BUT the CGI was really bad and the green screen backgrounds were so painfully obviously fake that it was distracting and disappointing. The extreme slow motion was waaayyyy to long and I got bored. So did my husband and we are big on action movies. Gory violence and all. I think they tried too hard to be like the 300 with a small budget. It just didn't work.
3,3rd disc is not playing,"As far as series goes it is definitely an absorbing bloody series. I liked it instantly. As far the product goes as one of the user already complained, 3rd disc would not play on any of the devices i have. 2 blu ray players, PC bluray drive and PS3. I just opened and played it. It was not working. Extremely dissatisfied. I am not even sure what to do about it. I wish the first disc didn't play. I would have been able to send the disc back in time."
5,Great Show,"This is a great series! I missed some of the beginning episodes on Starz during the original broadcast so I bought the DVD. I am glad I did. The story line is very well done and the actors are first class. Because there is a lot of violence in the action scenes and some nudity, the show is for an adult audience. I don't usually purchase movie DVDs but this is one I will watch again. Once you start viewing the series it is hard to stop. I look forward to continuation of the series."
4,Spartacus,This is an excellant series which deserves to be in everyones movie collection. Granted some battle scenes have a lot of blood but that contributes to the violence of the time period.
5,Spartacus Blood and Sand The Complete First Season Blu-ray,I got it at a good price and it came to my home in two working day's. A very good job.
