5,Boys Love It Too,"I bought this set for my 4 year old nephew because my sister said he was driving my niece crazy by playing with her My Little Pony toys. This looked as close as I could get to ""ponies for boys"". Once it arrived, my 5 year old son pestered me for his own set -- going so far as to wish upon a star for a set of ponies (he has never expressed the least interest in horses before). All Christmas day, the three of them played with this set, rescuing the ponies with a helicopter, putting them in trailers, making stables out of boxes, etc, etc. It's now two days after Christmas and here I am, ordering a set for him."
5,Nice product,"Very nice set, the little ""barn"" for the horses is wooden. very cute and we are quite happy with it."
4,Great playtime toy,"In the era of iPads, nooks, and so on, it's really great to see my twin girls playing with these cute little horses using they're imagination. The horses are all different and are quite detailed. My girls love horses and love these little guys."
5,Cutest little horses ever!,"These little horses are so detailed and adorable, my daughter really loves playing with them. The case also doubles as a storage container, albeit one that you have to lay down flat. Great fun!"
3,cute but breaks easy,"My 3yr old daughter loves to play with horses,especially small(baby)ones. I ordered these along with the Melissa and Doug stable so she could play mommy/baby horses. Although these are very cute they are not very durable. She has only been playing with them for 4 days and we are already down 4 horses, the legs keep breaking off. She does not play very rough with them, she just pretends they are running/walking/playing (normal play I would think and the same as she plays with all of her other toys). Good thing the package came with 12 or I would have one sad 3yr old. I gave it 3 stars because they are very detailed and attractive but durability definitely gets 1 star :("
1,Piece of junk!!,Do not waste your money on this one -- too many other nicer horse options out there. The horses are cheap fuzzy creatures. More effort by the manufacturer was put into the wood container that holds the horses but it is not a fun way to play with the horses anyway. My daughter put all the horses in a barn yard house she has and never looked at them again!
2,Not well made,"My daughter was 4 when I bought these horses. They are a cheaply constructed hollow thin plastic that is not difficult to crush, as she stepped on one and found out. She played with them relatively gently, not pulling or picking at them, but still the fur came off easily and continued to peel away, though we tried to glue it back, it wouldn't adhere to the slick plastic. The manes and tails eventually came out too."
2,less than 5 days and falling apart!,It has been less than 5 days - with very little use/wear and 1 horse has a broken leg and 2 have bits missing... I will be looking into returning this... thought since it was melissa and doug it would hold up better...
2,Poor quality.. Legs break easily,Consider other options for toy horses. These have hollow legs that break off easily if your child rests a hand on the horse or sits on it by accident during play. Others like Schleich will last longer. We got the set of 12 at Christmas and at least half have broken.
1,Cheap,I ordered these for my 5 year old daughter to accompany the foldable/portable stable. Shame on me - in the Chrismas rush I ordered them without reading the reviews and had expected a much higher quality product for the price. As the most helpful negative review accurately points out these have a fuzzy coating that I would fully expect to flake off with just a bit of active play. I can best describe the appearance as very cheap and it reminds me of a token carnival toy. Luckily I have enough time to return these and order better quality products from Breyer or Schleich. Do not order these unless all you want to do is sit them on a shelf.
3,prednisone,"Not too impressed, the title looks as if this gives a general explanation of the drug, but it mostly refers to lung conditions. In my case it is P.M.R. and the book gives no indication of this."
5,Excellent Book,"Having been prescribed 60 mg's of prednisone a day for IBD, and experiencing a lot of the nastier pschological side effects, I found this book a great source of comfort. Both co-authors take turns writing in the first person; the patient describes her personal experience and the doctor discusses the medical aspects of those experiences. This is an effective strategy that is simultaneously reassuring and informative.From what I've read, there is in fact little that can be done to mitigate the side effects of long term, high dosage prednisone use. This book's value lies not in providing a miracle remedy for alleviating prednisone side effects. Rather, the book provides a source of reassurance for those having to suffer through the effects of steriod therapy."
2,Read with Caution,"I have hesitated all day about writing this because I have such mixed feelings about this book. Ms. Zukerman had an illness of rather short duration and she has been told not to expect a reoccurance.For those of us who have no choice but to live with this medicine year in and year out, a great deal of her advice seems limited.I have Crohn's disease and over twenty years I have gained 45 pounds. I certainly can't live on the diet that is suggested in this book. Just the beans alone would put me in intensive care!Ms. Zukerman is from the ""you can never be too thin"" school of self centeredness and if I were to embrace her value system I would be one unhappy camper. There are trade offs in life that Ms. Zukerman has obviously not had to make.So the information is there but a good endocrinologist could give you more. And if perchance you can't be rich and famous with a sister who is a doctor no less, don't despair. There are more of us than there are of them!"
4,"Helpful book- medical info, side effects & how to COPE.","I bought this book when I was frustrated with the effects of prednisone. I have cystic fibrosis and asthma, and have been on steriods off and on, but most recently 8months straight- with no end in sight. I happen to be a registered nurse, so many of the medical information was not new to me, but was straight forward and easily understood for the average person. I enjoyed reading though that I am NOT alone in the side effects - and more importantly tips to cope with them. The author was not on prednisone year on end, and her condition stablized to where she no longer needed it, HOWEVER- her insight was valuable. The only way I could see this book being more helpful would be if the patient was a long term steriod user - with a chronic illness."
3,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed in this book as I was hoping for far more detailed information on the side effects of Prednisone and how long it normally takes for those effects to go away after stopping the drug, so for me it lacked ALL the information I was hoping for."
1,"Not exactly helping you ""cope""","I was really disappointed in this book. I was hoping for a book that would allow me to relate to another person who unfortunately has to take this drug. However, I felt worse about myself after reading the book than I did before! Most people on Prednisone are depressed and self conscious enough already and this book really depressed me more. I think that there is better information available to people on the internet. I wouldn't spend the money on this book!"
3,Good Info,"Although this book does provide some good information it does not fit with the reality of my situation. There are those of us who have been placed on Prednisone by our doctors and are not fully informed of the side affects, until too late. The author of this book was diligent in researching ahead of time and had the will power (and time) to eat correctly and exercise sufficiently to stay-off the fattening effects of the drug. My case was different in that I was told, primarily, very little on the effects until after I had begun the therapy for hepatitus. This information needs to be read BEFORE starting the drug."
3,video,"Not so good. However if you like the old grainy bar scene rawness in a video performance, it is interesting from that point of view. Bonnie herself, is always good. I would not have purchased it, if I had seen it previous."
4,"If u like Bonnie, this is interesting early stuff by her.","This video is old, Bonnie is much better now. If u are curious as to what she did, when she was coming up, then this is ok to get. Not a very exciting video, but she's nice on it. It has a terrible resale value."
2,A bit disappointed,"I must admit that I had high hopes for this product.First and foremost, the band isn't really long enough to go around my bicep. I don't have huge arms, by any stretch of the imagination, but there is still a lot of the velcro exposed. Which leads me into my second gripe..The velcro has two parts, the hook part and the fuzzy part. On this particular armband, it would have made more sense to switch the two. Because the armband doesn't go completely around my arm, and because the rough part of the velcro is facing out, it rubs against my technical shirt and chafes it. It's starting to pill where the arm band rubbed against it at the top of my ribs. If they'd only thought to put the soft velcro there instead, it probably wouldn't have done this.I've resorted to wearing this ""armband"" around my ankle which serves a purpose, but takes a little getting used to."
4,Good Country Gospel,"If you like good old country Southern gospel music, you will enjoy this CD. I especially like the fact that at Amazon.com, you can many times save money by purchasing a ""used"" CD or DVD. Most of them are like new, and I have never been disappointed with any used items I have purchased here."
5,THE COLOR VERSION OF 'A STREET CAR NAMED DESIRE',"Even though my mother is an ardent 'Brando Fan',and does have in her collection,the B/W version, I have always relished the color version of the same film. I am a 'new-generation girl' and B/W classics are not my cup of tea. May-be because it is a 1984 production and much closer to my birth date. The performances of the various stars, specially Ann Margret, are superb. Even in the amazon review, it is listed as a 'Randy Quaid' film. I suggest you change it into,'An Ann Margret film'. No offence meantguys. I have no hesitation in giving it a five star rating."
5,Great fun to read!,"This book is full of tasty tidbits of tinseltown trash talk. Young obviously spent years researching many rumors about L.A. and its inhabitants. It's not just about celebrites and their dirty secrets, it also talks about city government scandals and even little details like what the different colored bandannas that gay prostitutes display in their back pockets really mean. Young also lets the reader decide whether some stories are true or not by presenting the results of his research and not forcing his opinion on you. It is a delightfully entertaining read."
4,Really did his homework,"Los Angeles--more than any other town--is built on rumors so thick on the ground that they've largely calcified beyond urban legend and in to accepted fact. However, the author of this book has--to his credit--gone out of his way to take each of these rumors and investigated them as best he could, given that many of these events took place decades ago and especially as they took place in an L.A. ruled by movie tycoons with a lot at stake and great incentive to cover up the dark and nasties, and minions expert at doing just that. Nevertheless, this book is an interesting and revealing look into the truth behind the gossip that built this city."
2,I want my time and money back,Feel free to consider the positive reviews but I am obligated to caution readers. It was full of the same broad advice you here espoused everywhere in investment books. These are general rules that offer no help in the specific interpretations.Bottom line..if you have never read or listened to any investment or gambling books then maybe this could be new material otherwise you've prob heard it all before.
2,Too Generic,"This book was a bit of an enigma to me. The Axioms themselves are great. However, the stories/illustrations given are so terribly generic any 1/2-creative storyteller could come up with them. The only specifics given are his dad's name, and the name of a bank his dad worked for. Strangely enough, every time he mentions his dad in this book, he uses the man's full name. When have you ever used your dad's name in full, and would you do it dozens of times if you wrote a book?I do stand by the 2 stars, though, as the Axioms themselves, I think, have some merit, if not Gunther's explanations & applications.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. If you want to read a book about the stock market, get one written by someone you've heard of & that you know has been successful in the market, like Warren Buffett, (who hasn't written a book, but has written publicly-available shareholder letters & has a couple biographies out)."
5,Nice read. The axioms although kind of general they offer good guidance,"Although the axioms are kind of general they nevertheless offer some good guidance to those who would like to build on that foundation. I liked the book, it is a nice read."
5,I recommend this book to any beginner investor!,"I'm a beginner investor in real estate, and I'm self-taught in most of the things I do. This book is a good book, which I keep on my bed table together with other essential books of mine. I've read through it all and come back to it for reference once in a while. I recommend this book to other beginners!"
4,They were too large for me,"These things are heavy! And large, in fact they were too large for my Triumph. But I can see them nicely on a bigger Motorcycle. Very solid feel and a good price if you need to replace the original footpegs. I have exchanged them for the same footpegs in the standard size and are very happy with them."
5,Terrific for everyday use!,"Never tried stemless glasses before. But was getting tired of hand-washing my regulars which were starting to look a little grungy! These glasses have a solid feel to them, and I've washed them in my dishwasher at least once a week for the last 12 months with no chips or breaks. Highly recommended, its a treat to have a clean set of glasses with little effort!"
4,Great Glasses,"The glasses are kind of small, but I should have known based on the ounces before I ordered. They are sturdy and have a very cool design, no problems here!"
1,Save your money,"This is an incomplete list of available guns in 2001. It also has guns listed that are no longer available. The pictures do not match up to the descriptions. There is a lot of useless information ie. air guns, lists of books about guns etc. I was disapointed with this book. I expected to see more information and reviews on available models. Did not even list Khar's 9MM, Guns and Ammo's Magazine Handgun of the Year winner in the book anywhere."
3,First Timer,"This was the first novel I have read by Lori Copeland and I thought it was just ""ok."" It was pretty slow during some parts and I felt there was too much inner dialogue from Wynne. Wynne's thoughts became pretty redundant through the middle of the book and more conversations between characters would have really helped. But I am still going to give her other books a try!"
3,Okay Read,"This is the first book of a series that follows another series by the same author. The first series is titled Brides of the West. I enjoyed reading them, but not the best christian fiction I have read."
5,THe Peacemaker,"This was the first one of the series I purchased. It was in good condition and enjoyed it fully that I ordered the other 3 in the series. Four soldiers coming home from the Civil War, each turning in different directions and different lives and loves. Very good reads."
2,Sophomoric At Best,"I picked up this book because I thought a little fluffy fiction would be a nice winter-time diversion and I had never read any Lori Copeland. I did finish the book, but only because I forced myself to do so. It's drawbacks:- I found the writing to be bland and sophomoric, at best. The plot, if you could call it that, was flat and not at all compelling. More than predictable, it was silly.- Character development was non-existent. This book is replete with one-dimensional characters.- No real Christian depth here. It was as though the ending was thought up first, and then a weak story was created to get us to that destination.I suppose some may like this book and this series. I found it to be much like a rice cake. Full of air and tasteless. I much prefer fiction that sweeps me away with deep character study and solid doctrinal truths. Ms. Copeland fails to deliver on both counts. My apologies Lori. I'm sure it's just me, as you have a loyal following."
1,ITS,"My husband just saw this book in a bookstore and told me that he couldn't figure out why the authors spelled ""ITS"" without an apostrophe. ""Its"" is not correct for the usage in the sentence. It should be ""It's"". Do the authors have a different meaning to that word? If the authors can't spell the title word correctly, would I want to read what they are saying? Thank you....."
4,Nice hobby box,"Got a pair of Lebron rookie cards. The box is almost a complete set, missing about 2 minor cards."
5,bella pop star,I ordered this item right before christmas and it arrived on time! it got here so fast and my neice just loves it! She has already memorized all the dance moves! Thanks!
3,"Excellent repackaging to ""Slim line""","The packaging is now revised to slim line, which saves space. I originally rented this product at the local library, the old packaging was 3 standard DVD cases (bulky)The film itself is excellent, but I rated this 3-stars because PBS has so many other better space/universe DVD programs, such as Origins, Exploring Space, Life Beyond Earth, and Carl Sagan's Cosmos.I do agree w/ a previous reviewer of this being slow, especially first 2 hours, but I suggest viewing the last DVD, ie hour 6 (the Theory of Everything) first. String theory is most interesting."
4,Informationally boring but definitely worth my time.,"Starbucks played an integral role in the success of this series with me. However, I thoroughly enjoy cosmology so I like getting the big picture delivered by this set. The series definitely provides a clear understanding of the history of cosmology as well as current theories with as much explanation as you will find on any DVD out there. After watching Hawking's other video production, ""A Brief History of Hawkings and Time"", I was glad to find this series focused on the science instead of Hawkings himself. I believe the more you know about cosmology the more interesting you will find this program. Some of the information in this program is not easily understood unless you already know a little. Overall I found this program very useful. This set is an effective, comprehensive learning tool, not a day at the movies. Hawkings has definitely clicked out a pretty good program here!"
2,"Good Narration, Shame About the Visuals","This video series covers all the basic ideas of cosmology in an interesting and easy to understand manner, with a strong historical focus. The narration, describing this, is very interesting and well thought out. However, the visual aspect is appalling. Most of it consists of out of fucus shots of things that have nothing to do with the program, irrelvant images of star fields, shots of people walking around, shots of empty rooms and other irrelevances. When people are interviewed, they are often shown in very dim surroundings, making their faces hard to see. All in all, the visual elements are just hopeless and add nothing to the video. Towards the end, I didn't even bother looking at the screen but just listened to the audio. I lost nothing by doing this. All in all, Professor Hawking might as well have written another book."
2,Lack of Visual Aids,"Stephen Hawking's Universe covers all the important points in Cosmology, but when one buys a video documentary on the subject, one expects more than just lucid explanations by talking heads (or even a head that uses a computer to talk). I was disappointed that for all the good work put into the making of SHU, the visual component was so poor; why not just make it into an audio book instead? Most of the time, throughout the entire series, the same set of bland, information-free starfield images and lame optical tricks (we're not even talking cheap computer animation!) accompany narration of (relatively) deep, conceptual scientific ideas. The rare instances in which camera footage is included -- say, to show a scene at an earth-based telescope -- quench the viewer's thirst for visual aid only long enough to underscore the series' basic dearth of such resources. Better luck next time, Stephen."
2,Poorly done.,"I thought that because of Stephen Hawking, this was going to be great (I wish I could see more of his direct work on the film). It was pretty bad. First it looked as if it was filmed through a very dark blue filter. It was very hard to see. I thought my tv was broken. Also, the same graphic of an exploding star is used from everything to supernovas and blackholes, it is quite irritating. The information is poor at best, it covered 1/100 of the infomation in A Brief History of Time, a very good book (I never saw the video). Don't buy this, it is not worth it, try to catch it on PBS if you are interested, or rent it from your library."
2,Very slow,"I'm up to the second chapter, but its not for anyone who has read the book or is an amature. The pace the DVD sets is slow slow, you need to find other things to do while watching it. Narration is the slowest ever for a documentary, even when telling you history. I'm sure the technical detail is there, just not made interesting enough to keep me watching, which counts all kids and teenagers out as well (I'm 25).I don't think I will watch them all, I don't have that much time, I will read the book again instead - much quicker.I won't buy a PBS DVD/Video again, lots of advertising on the disc, sponsorship messages."
1,Tries to be too cute,"All the unusal camera angles, and shots in poor light are very annoying...the program contains tons of needless fluff."
2,Late night news approach,"There are many fine aspects to this film biography. Its interviews, particularly with Wilson's granddaughter, and thoughtful critique by George Will. But from its opening moments, it adopts a ""sensational"" late night news approach, accenting Wilson's alleged extramarital affair. The evidence for this being anything more than ""platonic"" is seriously in question. Too bad a great opportunity was lost for incisive critique and appreciation of this fine American statesman."
5,Flashback to the late 70's counter culture.,"Dan O'Neill's ramblings are best served with a side order of medicinal marijuana. However, even those of us who are clean and sober can appreciate the fun of the disjointed banter between Hugh and Fred and assorted cast. Caution, it is best not to read the entire book in one sitting. Mental permutations will result."
2,I did not like it .,Idid not like this Item I bought two of them and they both broke in about a week
2,Nice concept done on the ''cheap'',"Of course Jayne hated Mamie,so the concept of the premise of this book is an attractive one.They were fighting for similar parts,mostly after 1962 when their original inspiration was dead and buried.So what is this book showing us or learning us really ?ABSOLUTELY NOTHINGApart from (very cheaply done)scanned pictures of copies of covers of all the magazines and/or movie posters these two ladies were on or in,we learn nothing about their rivality.What rivality,you might ask ? In the only movie they both appeared in together (Las Vegas Hillbillys),Jayne Mansfield had in her contract that she was not going to have ANY contact on screen,or even off screen with the ''Drive-in answer to Marilyn Monroe''.The only text you will be reading in this book is coming from whatever equivalent to the ''National Enquirer'' they had in the fifties and sixties= LOW-BROW all the way !"
1,This is a boring book,"This book is really boring. The author does not describe what form is (At first, I thought it were the patterns in this style). It probably looks like that the author didn't put much effort into this book's content. The pictures weren't pretty clear. It didn't describe all the hand forms, but only the close fist forms. I had to learn them from my past experience in Shaolin Kungfu. The author didn't put good describing words in either. Not reccommended."
4,Good Intro,"This serves as a good intro to the art. It does an excellent job at inspiring one to undertake the study for CLF, as it has for me. I must say though that the movements are barely described. You'd have to have prior experience in Kung Fu to have any idea what they are talking about. Does anyone know of any authentic CLF schools in New York?"
1,"Lots of photos, little substance","This is one of the few books I've been able to find on CLF, and found it incredably lacking. If it weren't for two forms presented inside the book, it would be little more than a pamphlet. The reader gets an introduction into Choy Li Fut, but not enough to really learn anything. Liniage is presented, weapons used are named, and you get to see a couple of poorly-shot photos of finnished techniques. I don't really recomend that anyone get this book, unless you want to learn CLF's first two forms and have no teacher."
4,"It's a good, but short book.","This Choy Li Fut book is a pretty good introductory book on the Choy Li Fut system. I've heard of lots of tales about the systems origins, but this has it. Well, don't be fooled by the cover where it says step-by-step guide to the fighting secrets of Southern China's....There's only 2 forms: Five Wheel Stance and Fist. In some points, I'd have to agree with the first comment on this page. It doesn't even describe the movement of the forms. The pictures aren't pretty clear. At least it's more genuine than the Choy Lay Fut book by Lee Koon Hung."
2,Lacks detail and explanation,"This is an OK book on choy li fut gung fu by the grandmaster of this style. Yes, its impossible to become a gung fu master without a teacher, training and effort. However I expected far more from this book than what it delivers. Its so so on basics and concepts but lacks critical details on how to do footwork, punches and kicks as well as no form or technique instruction on the huge arsenal of choy li fut weapons such as the plum blosson spear and kwan do. For a better gung fu book, check out Bruce Lee's books on JKD as well as the Hung Gar Kung Fu books by Bucksam Kong. The photos in this Choy Li Fut book are difficult at best to follow. I just hope that grandmaster Doc Fai-Wong rewrites and updates this book to make it worthy."
4,A must for all Choy-Li-Fut students,"This book covers all for the Choy Li Fut student. If you have never trained in choylifut then why buy the book? You can't learn from a book, you need to go and study from a teacher exposed in the ""style"" you wish to study. Never expect to learn from a book."
1,One More Let Down,"I bought this and one other book written by Mr. Deep and Mr. Sussman. I was very disappointed to find that both books did not cover the topic in a way that relates to real situations that occur in the world of business. I wish I could state otherwise, however this book is not one that I can recommend to any reader interested in the topic of management."
1,Pass this one over.,"I expected a book that provided a ready question to use in any situation - this is a book that provides you with a list of questions that you ask yourself when the world bites you.I wanted a list of questions to bite other people as you always answer a tough question with another question. Perry Mason always had the right question to thump the witness that got out of line.This is a self help book, not a guide to verbal and intellectual war with pompous managers and other fellow travelers. Give it a wide berth unless you are already sinking in your own failure."
5,Creative Thoughts About the Business of Writing!,"If you have a book inside you and have yet to begin to write, you must make this one one of the first you read. Lots of great stuff in this handy guide!"
1,Stop Do Not Belive Some Reveiws,"So bad it may be worth a look.This movie is just a big pile of T and A nothing more. To get the actresses the talent scout must have went straight down to the sleaziest strip club he could find and picked out the girls who could give the best lap dances. Nothing about this looks real the lead actress Bella the ""good-looking tourist"" looks like one of those trannies that should have stayed a man, please go back to the club and stay off film. If you can make it all the way through this work of art you are doing way more then most people would do. I started watching and my jaw dropped in amazement at how poor this is. Pure junk, poor story, bad acting, shoddy sound track and some really poor sets make this a real stinker so bad you may want to see it to believe it."
3,good theme done poorly,I'VE READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS. BEAUTIFUL WOMEN (WHERE?) ACTING DONE POORLY BUT IT IS HILARIOUS. OF COURSE WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM A MOVIE MADE FOR ABOUT $2.00. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN A 'B' MOVIE HAD SOME REDEEMING QUALITIES BUT THIS ONE HAD NO PLOT NO GOOD GORE JUST ALOT OF NAKED WOMEN WITH HOODS ON AND THE FEW THAT THEY SHOWED FACES OF WERE WELL LET'S JUST BE KIND HERE ODD SHAPED AND NOT REAL CUTE. IF YOU CAN TAKE 1HR 18MIN WITHOUT THE FAST FOWARD BUTTON YOU HAVE DONE BETTER THAN ME. THE ONLY REGRET I HAVE IS THAT I ACTUALLY PAID FOR THIS MOVIE
1,My thoughts,"Someone should have abducted the people responsible for making this film. What an absolute load of crap. The acting is totally horrible and the plot non existant. This is nothing more than excuse to film a bunch of naked chicks and watch lots of bad sex.This shouldnt be sold, it should be burnt."
1,Horrible Movie,"The movie is bad ...looks like it was filmed with a camcorder , and the actors...oh god !!!where do I begin..looks like they just took anyone off the street andsay hey wanna be in a movie...one word...Horrible!!!!...please donot be like me and buy this crappy movie..."
1,won't play on dvd player,when I got the movie it would only play on a pc. not on either of 2 dvd players I own no matter what I tried. watched it on a pc. movie had no contiguous story line...and not even one enticing sceen
1,Zero to Sticky in 30 Seconds,"I bought this product based on the other recommendations, and price. We had been using Yes organic water based lubricant, which is fantastic, but expensive. Now I'm throwing this bottle of Pure Aqua out. It comes out of the bottle with a wonderful consistency but starts to gum up quickly. Don't waste your money."
4,"Honk for ""Gator Tail""","I had never heard of tenor saxophonist Willis ""Gator Tail"" Jackson until I found hisLegends of Acid Jazzin the cut-out bin at Newbury Comics a few years ago. There's nothing groundbreaking to his music, just some great soul jazz from a true bluesy gospel horn-honker. I was impressed enough to purchase another half-dozen discs by this artist, all of which are currently going out-of-print. ""Together Again!"" culls music from four sessions, originally issued on two LPs, now all jammed on to one CD. Organist Jack McDuff and guitarist Bill Jennings feature on all 13 tracks, with a variety of interchangeable bassists and drummers, though the great Milt Hinton features on the collection's three best tracks from February 1960. Gator and Brother Jack have great chemistry, but the most pleasant surprise is Jennings, who must be the most country-influenced jazz guitarist since Les Paul. Soul jazz fans do yourself a favor and honk for ""Gator Tail"" while you can."
5,"Not a light read, but very informative.","This book is very informative and each story is written by someone actually in the field. The stories go into great detail and personal account of each career path. My one complaint is that it doesn't include non-traditional areas such as art therapy, eco-psychology, and similar paths, but all in all it is a great book!"
4,Great,This is a really helpful book to help figure out if a particular field of psychology is right for you
3,Substance vs smell,"I bought mine used in ""good condition"". No pages are torn, no markings. But if I could get past the incredibly mildew smell that the previous owner sent it as, I might be able to embrace its actual content. I have only read the Counseling Psychology chapter but it seemed very insightful between holding my nose and breathing through my shirt.I at least found that I was on the right track but I'm not sure how much more of it I'll be reading, not only because it's offensive odor, but because I'm not sure how much more will apply to me as each chapter seems to address only specific psychology professions at a time."
2,This is the best psychologist Yale has to offer?,"This book does not contain common fields people go into with a psych degree such as case management, human services, and substance abuse counseling. Look around at your school for a binder by students that interviews people in the field. This book is a bit ""lofty."""
3,an OK textbook,"It's an OK text book. I know I would never buy a book like this for my own sake. However, since it's a PsyD program assigned textbook, I have to go through it. Get bored several times during the reading. It's alright informative; I did learn a little information after reading it. So i think it's alright."
1,Unfortuanate dissapointment,"misspellings abound in Arabic words especially the vowels, which are so important to a new learner.the constant use of new vocabulary and expressions with no explanation whatsover, nor are they included at the glossary in the back of book.All these render this work useless as a learning tool."
3,Not as good as other Ultimates,This product was disappointing to me as I have studied other Ultimate language programs and they were very good. This product is just not helpful in developing a full and useful vocabulary. The dialect cds are too limited to be of much use. Overall I do not recommend the Ultimate Arabic.
1,Loaded with errors.,"I am suprised at some of the reviewers that gave this program good reviews. The text is loaded with errors and for the beginner, this is a real disservice. If you buy this program, be prepared to be confused when some words and phrases are written several different ways."
1,Bad Bet! Don't buy it!,"I've had this slow cooker for 2 years, and it's burned nearly everything for this time. You can't set this while you're at work, which is the reason to buy a slow cooker. This item loses moisture and runs far too hot for what it's designed for. Buy something better."
5,Still the best Album by the one and only Willy DeVille,"Simply one of the greatest singers and songwriters of the last 30 years. Just in case you've only recently discovered Willy deVille - this is the absolute classic. ""Heaven Stood Still"" gotta be the mother of all ballads, and ""Just to walk that little Girl home"" comes a close second. The uptempo opener ""This must be the night"" features classic and hard to top Louis Cortellezzi sax solos. Grandiose and intimate, emotional and raw, Willy sings his heart out on every track with an intensity that is simply unmatched. One of the greatest CDs ever recorded."
5,Working Well,"The item arrived when promised in perfect condition. It was a breeze to set it up, and my ReadyNAS Ultra immediately recognized the UPS. Everything is working perfectly."
2,battery died after two years,"I purchased two of these products, and they worked well at the outset. During various power outages and surges, they kept everything smooth and functioning. My complaint is that, after having it for less than two years, the battery backup died. It still works as a surge protector, but that's not why you buy a product like this. I don't know what the expected life on this product is, but two years seems too short for the cost."
5,"So far, so good...","I've owned this product for a couple months now, and only experienced a brief outage or two, but this battery backup has performed flawlessly. The load for this unit is perfect for home use, but be aware that only 4 outlets are surge- AND battery-protected - - this is fine if you choose your components wisely (there's no reason to plug some items in to the battery-protected outlets). The software is easily installed and can gracefully power down your PC during an extended outage.So far this unit has out-performed the comparable APC unit that I also owned..."
4,Great UPS Unit,"Purchasing this item for a client of mine, we have purchased over 100 of them. When on battery, the unit stays on for over 10 minutes with a standard high end pc with a lcd monitor. We just purchased another 20 and with FREE shipping from Amazon, over $193 in shipping costs were saved.The price was comparable with the APC ES550 and this unit has 8 receptacles instead of the 6 on the APC. The replacement batteries is slightly more expensive than the APC's, but they hold slightly more juice.The software that comes with the unit is usable and does shut down the system cleanly when power does not return before the battery runs out."
4,CyberPower UPS,"It's a fine product, works just as expected. It replaced a like unit by the same manufacturer that has worked flawlessly since 2000. Needed another one for another computer system and very pleased with the product as well as the excellent customer service through Amazon.com."
4,Just what I needed,"This unit says it'll power my PC for 17 minutes. Of course, I shut down the moment power is lost (it'll auto shut down in 5 minutes). The unit is then used to keep power on my cable phone and router. I can go portable at that time. I suspect that I have at least an hour of power (just a guess) with the cable phone and router.If you like info during an outage, get the unit with an LCD readout. This one requires your computer to tell you battery levels. The LCD does not.If this unit lasts 5 years like my last unit, I'll give it 5 stars."
5,Works!,"I purchased this to use with a home theater setup. It has been working beautifully since it was set up, and I have no complaints."
1,Greatest Example of False advertising ever Made,"Unless you are supplying backup power to a night light forget this product and buy an APC or Tripplite. Not only is the tech support a bunch of clowns -took 3 days to tell me that this unit is only good as a paper weight- but the product is junk. All I had plugged into the thing was a CPU and it tripped the breaker on a power outage. The CPU was using only half of the available power according to their software and it couldnt even handle that. Tech support's fix buy a different computer. My fix- go elsewhere if you are using it to power a computer, buy it if you are powering a night light. Not to mention their tech support was giggling and laughing the whole time I was on the phone with them, I finally had to talk to another rep because the first one was busy playing."
4,As Advertised,"Has done what it is advertised to do. It keeps my computer up and running. At 350W the UPS function powers one computer only, but you get surge for many periphs."
3,Good While It Lasts,"Purchased 2 Cyberpower CP685AVR USPs in March 2008. They both worked well, with good service for 3 years. Frankly, they worked well enough for the first 3 years that I often forgot about them, which I found pretty impressive and ideal for a backup device. However, after 3 years, coincidentally the same period that Cyberpower warrants the products, the battery backups in both died, one after 37 months of use, the other after 38 months of use. Only 3 years for a backup product like and of this cost is just not long enough."
1,Suck for Linux,"Unless you have a system running their power monitoring widget, the UPS function doesn't work. Case in point, I have a Linux system running mythdora and every time I have a power blink, the box reboots. If I have my XP system with the widget running, the UPS functions properly during a power blink.My APC unit does not require the APC widget to be running to keep power to the outlets.Poor design, I guess they never considered someone using a UPS for something other than a Windows or Mac desktop, like a switch, cable modem, etc.[..]"
5,Does Whay It's Supposed To,"This is my first UPS = so can't compare it to others. But so far it's performing very well. I'm in a rural area where power interruptions are common. Probably average 2 a week. This unit has handled every outage just like it's supposed to. Plus, it's nice to be able to go back & see details of the outage."
1,1 of 3 works,"Have three of these. Two died at the last power outage we had. Back up battery part failed to function and now the sockets on that side do not work even after resetting by pressing the red ""reset"" button on the side. The third one is still working fine ,but I do not trust them any longer. I am replacing them with a different make in the hopes of finding a reliable product. I will be pleased when China learns the true meaning of the word Quality. A rather expensive 4 outlet power strip.Cyberpower CP685AVR UPS - 685VA/390W AVR 8-Outlet RJ11/RJ45 Compact Design EMI/RFI USB"
1,Not what I was told,"I was told that an uninterruptible power supply was the only thing that would protect my devices plugged into an ungrounded outlet, that a ""line conditioner"" like this one, that would even out any spikes, dips, or surges, was my only line of defense, that all the surge protectors and GCFI fixtures in the world wouldn't do what this thing does, epecially since most electricians wouldn't even bother with the job of ripping out 60 year old wiring and replacing it with grounded circuits, were anyone able to afford such an overhaul.But upon receipt of this device I noticed right away that the red light for ""wiring fault"" was lit up and the instructions said, to my shock and dismay, that this thing doesn't protect me either unless plugged into a grounded circuit! So, other than monitoring my voltage and providing battery backup for the extremely rare power outage in my area, this is a $70 power strip."
2,6 Months and Out,I thought I'd save some money and bought this unti. Six months later I walked into the house and though something was burning. After a carful search I found My PC powered off and a real bad buring smell coming out of this unit. It was super hot also. I discarded the unti and got myself a pro quality APC Smart UPS. It was more than 3 times the price but the peace of mind is worth it.
1,Stop working after a month,"I bought two of these UPS AVR's for my business because they fit the specification of what I needed. I have been using both with a standard computer, monitor, and printer and one keep's beeping and now I have to go out and replace this item. The worst part is Amazon does not except returns on these items so I'm pretty much got screwed out of $65.00."
3,More And Less,"Arguably the better 'best of' collection from ""The Andrea True Connection"", it's a bewildering set. Do note that Andrea True only had a few radio hits, ""More, More, More"", ""Party Line"", ""Call Me"", ""N.Y., You Got Me Dancing"" and ""What's Your Name, What's your Number"". However, ""More, More, More"", ""Keep It Up Longer"" and ""Call Me"" were the big disco singles, for which those in the 1976 to 1978 era will remember best. The mixes aren't bad and the sound quality is surprisingly good from those albums. One big error on Amazon.com is that the single, ""More, More, More"" is the 3-minute version and not the 6-minute version, which is really why I purchased this CD. All the songs fall into the danceable disco category, except for, ""White Witch"", ""Life Is What You Make It"" and It's All Up To You"", which are attempts at mid-tempo fillers, the latter being truly bad. If somebody can turn me on to the long version of, ""More, More, More"", I'll pay you, cause it isn't on this set."
1,Looks like a nice hat.,"Henscel makes great hats, I have a black leather one got or my brth day.but I do not have this hat. I looked at it, but it cost too much. If I had the money I would get it. I never bought it."
3,Fantastic Introductory Book of the Astrology,"Jonathan Cainer, UK's top ranking astrologer, published an introductory book of the astrology. Even the people who are not familiar with the horoscopes can understand the basic ideas of the astrology. This book explains the meanings of the sun sign, moon sign, venus sign, and mars sign. Then it teaches us how to analyze the human characteristics based on the aspects between sun and moon, and venus and mars. You can also learn the way to examine the relationship between two people. Although serious astrological students may be disappointed with rather basic contents, I am sure that even they could be impressed with Jonathan's philosophical and profound expressions in many articles of this book."
3,meh,"low-res, clumsy and bulky but served it's purpose of no tv at the time.there is better choices out there now"
3,"Expensive, but helpful","Value wise, I give it 3 stars, but performance wise its 5 stars. I love this thing, but feel it was overpriced. I expected to receive two of the arms, from the picture they used to use, showing two of them on a desk. I personally prefer an L-shaped desk where I can rest my whole arm on top of it while using the mouse. However, I am just using a normal table now, and this helps A LOT! It really does releive pain you may have never realized you had or could change. It feels good and natural while using it, it does not restrict movement and its not much of an issue to transition to the keyboard from the mouse without unseating your arm."
3,a half-hearted attempt for an american classic,"the graphics are weak, using book illustrations to illustrate much of the narrative, they didn't even pick a wide variety, nor the best, but instead we see some of the same sub-standard illustrations over & over. The voice of ""Mark Twain"" sounds like a geriatric Forrest Gump. And the explanations of his life and decisions are superficial, glossing over the deep contradictions of this intelligent and tormented genius. Still, the interviews with Twain scholars are informative, and one's appetite is whetted to learn more of the this influential american classic."
4,mark twain adventures,"this movie was a great learning expeirience for me because it was very discriptive and told me about the amazing adventures of mark twain. it shared his events in life and told about his characters, overall i enjoyed this film very much"
2,Mark Twain Bio,Not the picture I was hoping for. I'm still searching for the biography where Sam tells about being born on the tail of Haley's Commet.Been searching for it for years and about to give up!
3,the price of this product is hiking?,As I recalled the 9000 ed has MSRP only around $2000 right? how come even used one now costs at $4300?
2,trouble in river city,The scanner works well when it works. But it's very flaky. I've had to send it back 3 or 4 times to get it to work right.Also Nikon gave up on keeping up with the software for mac OS so you need to buy 3rd party soft ware to make it work.Maybe this is why B&H; no longer sells it.
5,Very well done....,"I loved this biography. It is amazing that this material is available so many years after Ty Power's death. He was truly a super-star, and, thanks to sources like A & E and Amazon, he lives on in the many films he made in his all-too-short life."
4,More Billy Taylor,"Previously a neglected figure in my jazz collection, I have purchased a half-dozen Billy Taylor CDs in the past year, several of which I have recently reviewed on Amazon, includingWith Earl May & Ed ThigpenandCross Section. ""Billy Taylor Trio with Earl May/Percy Brice"" is another one of my Fantasy/OJC warehouse clearance sale finds on the Oldies/Collectables website. It features two albums originally made for the Prestige label on one disc -- ""At Town Hall"" a concert performance from NYC on December 17, 1954, and ""A Touch of Taylor,"" recorded on April 10, 1955 at Rudy Van Gelder's Hackensack, New Jersey studio. Both efforts are solid, straight ahead jazz with the only unexpected moment a 13-minute live rendition of ""How High the Moon"" where the trio really stretch out. Paying full price for this title is asking a bit much, but if you can find it cheaply like I did, then it's worthwhile."
3,"Customer support unavailable from company; product is ""discontinued""","Don't count on Turtle Beach if you need customer support because they have ""discountinued"" the product. I was having a heck of a time getting my S/PDIF output working with my Onkyo receiver until windowsupdate.com updated the driver (NOTE: I had to go to windowsupdate.com, select Custom update, and then I was able to select the driver -- drivers are not an automatic update from what I can tell). In the end, I got it working, but had a few days of frustration with it not working.As with many sound cards, the master volume control does not affect the volume level of the S/PDIF output, however the company has released a ""patch"" which is a seperate application you put in your Startup, which will tie the master volume control to the S/PDIF output volume.I haven't tested any of the multi-channel stuff. I'm just using this for listening to music on my receiver in 2-channel mode."
1,Get the Santa Cruz instead!,This card have less features than the Santa Cruz. It does not even come with any tweakable parameters such as an Equalizer. I have the Santa Cruz in my other pc and wished that I bought that card instead!
4,a satisfying read,"I really liked this. Troy was a tortured (literally!) hero, as was the heroine Lillian. We learnt a lot about what they felt individually as they learnt to come to terms with what had happened. Captured in France during the Peninsula war, Troy, the Earl of Ravenhurst, was then taken by a 'Black Widow' who did unspeakable things to her chosen victims. It was an emotional story, although I would have liked to have seen more interaction between the characters in order to build to the final conclusion."
1,Very little change.,I used this product faithfully for over a month with little or not difference. Don't waste your money.
1,awful,this smells great and moisturizes greatbut it does not work at all to make your veins go awayi would suggest to not get this product at all
2,Don't waste your money,"This product does not work...don't waste your money.. you will just be giving your money away...They got me once, and that was one time too many..you can't say that you were not warn...."
4,Some kids love it.,"My aunt bought it for her grand daughters who preferred their dolls so she gave it to my boys. The boys, 2.5 and 1 yr olds, love it and play with it everyday. They do enjoy locking things inside and they like to just play with the locks opening and closing them. I thought maybe it's not good to teach them the locks cuz then we can't lock them out of places we dont want them in and maybe they'll unlock the window and jump out but that hasnt been a problem yet."
5,Best read in a long time,Michael Lee West's writing has a way of catching your attention and keeping it. This was my first book by this author - I started another book by West(She Flew the Coop) the same day.What a page turner!The characters are quirky and their story even more so.I would highly recommend this book.
3,"Sliced into character renderings, not the best of West","Well, perhaps it is the more modern rendering of a tale, a reunion of family, of sisters, drawn together by tragedy, that makes this pie less delicious. I certainly like Michael Lee West's other books, especially, ""She Flew the Coop,"" and ""Consuming Passions"". But I find this novel less enticing, easier to put down and do something other than read."
3,Not bad....,"but then not near as good as her other two books, Crazy Ladies or She Flew the Coup. I felt the story line of this novel just drug on and on without really going anywhere. Too predictable!"
3,Southern Sisterhood & Family Ties,"American Pie is the story of 3 sisters from Tennessee who have suffered a painful childhood. After losing their parents, the girls are raised by their grandmother, Minerva. The story begins when one of the sisters, Jo-Nell, is in an accident, and Freddie and Eleanor, come to her side to help her recover. The characters and their relationships with one another seemed a little under-developed. The novel takes an interesting look at how 3 individuals cope differently given many of the same obstacles to over come, and how they try to free themselves from their current obstacles. I think overall, this novel was just ok. For other great southern writing, try Big Stone Gap by Adrianna Trigiani or Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood by Rebecca Wells."
4,Kept me interested,"I might have rated this book 5 stars if I hadn't read WHAT LOOKS CRAZY ON AN ORDINARY DAY right after it. I liked American Pie-- it kept me reading until the end and was much like the ""crazy"" book in terms of the story revolving around a woman coming home. I had somewhat of a hard time dealing with each chapter being written in the voice of one of the characters. At times I had to look back and see who was talking -- JoNell? Minerva? Freddie? Jackson? AND . . . . I wanted Sam to put in his two cents worth, even though he wasn't present. It made me think back to my first high school love and what it might be like to see him again. Overall, I enjoyed the book, the characters, and the setting. Kind of made me glad I'm a northern girl -- no offense to the South. If you're missing ""home"" as I am all the time, read AMERICAN PIE and don't miss WHAT LOOKS CRAZY ON AN ORDINARY DAY."
5,Realistic Novel by Inspirational American,"I read this book as in college at Syracuse University while taking a class from Shaw Dallal. His book, based on many events in his own life including some his invasive experiences when returning to Israel as an American, was the kind of story I like: real, believable, with a happy ending. It's a shame that the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict could not have such a happy ending."
3,"Nice, but...","Nice handles, but there are tiny little set screws that you have to tighten to get them to grip onto your bars. I had to turn them so tight to get them solid, that I stripped the set screws. I contacted Brooks and they wouldn't send me new screws. If I ever have to change them or tighten them, I'm 'screwed.'"
4,super styley!,"These grips are way grippier than i expected - a pleasant surprise. First and foremost i got them because they look flippin sweet. I was surprised at how bulky they are in my hand - but as I ride All Mountain it is suiting and I'm accustomed to it. Someone who is used to or expecing skinny grips may find these awkward. I don't, I'm stoked on them :)The only downside I've found, as mentioned in other reviews here, is that the lock screws on the end cap rings are very weak! I stripped them out by gently trying to tighten them down. Not sure whats up with that.I have only been out riding twice on them so far, so I haen't yet had a chance to really break them in, but so far I'm loving them!"
4,great book,"With literally only 3 days to study for the exam, I used this book to help me out, and I read ALL the review, and even had time to take a practice test. There are 30 chapters and a quiz after each one (about 5 questions) which really help, and the really scary thing is the questions were strickingly similar to the actual AP Exam, actually some were almost EXACTLY the same. I went from a ""1"" on the diagnostic test to a ""4"" after reading the whole book. I hope I did that well on the actual exam =)Only problem in there was that there were a few typos...I hate typos some years were mentioned before and then they changed it into 19-- instead of a dat ein the 1700s or they added an extra number like 18326 or something, and had a few misspellings, I'm finding these typos to be downright annoying and they appear frequently in Kaplan's books."
5,Extremely well-qualified to get you that high score,"This book went through rain and sunshine with me three weeks before the exam. Without it, i think I would have failed the exam."
2,False Advertising,"While Amazon claims these are ""Leather Bound"" I have learned that they are an ""Imitation leather""!After ordering one and using it for a few weeks I wondered why the back edge was cracking and looking poorly. I asked a friend to look at it and learned it was in fact a fake leather and told to return it or complain. I am complaining here and warning others.ISBN 10: 0-89942-641-7ISBN 13: 978-0-89942-641-9Pages: 1632; Size: 5 1/2 X 8; Cover: BURGUNDY; Binding: IMITATION LEATHER"
1,Disappointed with a Bible from yester-year,"While the binding and all was fine. All New American Bibles have the same text, I found the insert pages of old time pictures, a childish and ""inthe way"" addition that I did not care for. I felt like i was being given part of a catecism from the 50's. If you like that,..great. I sent this back and got a ""The Catholic Study Bible NAB"" which I am most impressed with. It is not thin, but it has lots of great recources with it. Your choice."
1,Why deny Mary's grace?,"According to the NAB, Luke 1:28 translates as, ""And coming to her, he said, 'Hail, favored one! The Lord is with you.'"" Other translations state, ""Hail, full of grace. The Lord is with you."" Why deny Mary's grace? Is this just to appease Protestants who already deny that the Hail Mary is biblical? Since we are dealing with the Holy Word, this does not seem like a good enough reason to change a perfectly good passage."
5,beautiful bible,I bought this as a gift for graduation. The cover is beautifully embossed and quality is excellent. Very special keepsake for years to come.
3,A bit disappointed,"I love the St. Joseph Edition, but the leather quality in this Bible was less than wonderful... and, the edging an unattractive reddish color.... I guess disappointing.... Nothing wrong with the content, though... Sorry.... Wish I could be more positive."
4,Reviewed in Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review,"James E. Coleman, Jr., writing in the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Review, Vol. 6, No. 1, 1999 notes: ""Whether Leeming is as successful in taking on an artist's life as he had been with the literary life of [James] Baldwin, I am not certain. His knowledge of Baldwin's literary world is not quite matched by his savvy of the art world of the same period. Nevertheless, we have a fine introduction to an artist whose reputation is growing and who lived a fascinating life."" That's high praise coming from Coleman, editor of The Encyclopedia Homophilica."
1,NOT A PLESANT VISION.............,"I'LL GET RIGHT TO THE POINT ! THIS DVD IS NOT GOOD AT ALL. IT'S FOR DIEHARD FANS ONLY!!!!!!!! JOE LOOKS VERY LOADED. THE BACKUP SINGERS ARE OFTEN OFF KEY AND THE MIX IS HORRIBLE. IF YOU WANT EXCELLANT JOE THE BUY THE ""ACROSS FROM MIDNIGHT"" DVD. THAT DVD IS THE BENCHMARK JOE DVD. I'VE OWNED THEM ALL AND THAT ONE IS BY FAR THE BEST........."
3,Not exactly what I wanted,"I bought this item because of its sleek look. The open end makes it easy to load a new roll of towels and unload empties, but I have a problem tearing off towels. Sometimes I jerk the whole roll off the rack."
1,Wrong Parts,"These studs are 3/8"" coarse studs. My Chevy truck takes 8mm fine thread for the exhaust manifolds. I checked several times and even checked Dorman before i ordered and both websites stated they will fit a 1999 Chevy silverado truck with the 4.8L engine. Wrong Wrong. I did not return them because i think later in life i might be able to uses them on another project. Don't trust what the websites say that it will fit your application. I did not find any specs for this part i trusted the website."
3,MYSTERY FOR ART'S SAKE,"The famed Fiora jewels are missing from a museum and everyone thinks former jewel thief turned antiques dealer John Mannering has them. Everyone but Mannering himself, who dons his former celebrated jewel thief persona, as 'The Baron', to discover who has the loot. This fast paced mystery is the 44th in the 'Baron' mystery series, and has an air of sophistication and exciting passages of chase sequences and police investigations, as it dabbles in the world of London trend and art forgery. Characters are sharply defined, Mannering and his wife, Lorna, are a breezy cool couple, and there is intrigue in Mannering's little incognito equipped antiques shop. Easy reading and maybe just a tad run-of-the-mill."
4,Creepy and Sexy - Two great tastes that go together,"Made by the same guys who made the filmAbduction, this movie looks like an earlier work. It's got a bunch of really cute ladies who move into a haunted house to record an album. The ghosts are also some very attractive women who seem to enjoy getting naked and playing pranks.It's a goofy, fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously."
1,"Don""t waste your time","this movie was horrible....not sure where all the positive reviews came, but this was utter garbage..another movie that was shot with a camcorder, and ..basically no budget, and people off the streets trying to act(if thats what you wanna call it)...terrible!!! terriblle!!!!"
1,More rigged reviews!,Beware of these bogus reviews. All these 5 star reviews were made by people in and/or involved with the making of this film.
1,should be called nightmare for the living,the previous positive reviews must have been submitted by family of the cast in this movie; this is the first time I submit a negative review but I felt I had to warn others that might be fooled by the other reviews as I was. Do yourself a huge favor and rent it if you are still curious ; you'll be glad . Even the rental fee is too much for this one though. I kept waiting throughout the movie and believe me that was a painful experience; for laughs I watched the interviews with cast members and saw some of their painful expressions as they were being interviewed; even some of the cast felt embarrassed being linked to this piece of work. rent first ; you'll thank me for this info.
3,A good tribute the the Micks,"One of the few books published by Osprey that covers the Irish. The CR were one of Englands Irish Regiments that while they must of had no love for England but they had great devotion to theor home ""The Regiment"". It just goes to show how smart the Brits were to invent a military system that could enlist potentially hostile folks and have them fight and fight very well for them.A good solid regimental history of some great troops who gave the French some real nightmares in Spain. if you like this one then check out the one on the ""Wild Geese"". (I would of given it a higher score but the illustrations are not up to snuff)"
2,Couldn't get past the first 3 stories,"As the writer of the ""starts slow, picks up steam"" reviewer wrote, the first three stories in this book are real snoozers. I might have tried going farther, but the book has so many typographical errors that it became distracting. If you're the editor of an anthology, it seems like you'd have two basic tasks: Pick good stories, and check for typos. The first one is entirely a matter of taste, but isn't the second one kind of straightforward?"
3,Just OK,"This anthology is slightly better than some of the more harrowing and frustrating collections that had been compiled by Mr Dozois in the previous years. ""Glacial"" was good. ""On K2 with Kankaredas"" was cute. But some of the other unbelievably boring stuff that is now-a-days celebrated as cerebral sci-fi dragged the anthology down."
2,Is this the best they can do?,"I will say that the opening essay that takes up about 20 pages is one of the most insightful things I have read dealing with Scifi in recent years. However the rest of the book is no where near as interesting. The stories are entirely to metaphysical and cyberpunky for my tastes. I stuck with this for ten stories sorry, i'm not going to force myself to read something out of some kind of misguided sense of obligation.Overall-For better entertainment ht yourself in the head with a brick, it will cost you less money."
4,The Firm Cardio: Power Cardio,"If you are a fan of The Firm fitness series, you know that they are high quality videos. This one is no exception. This workout follows the Firm philosophy that the most effective workout mixes cardio with strength training, though the main emphasis is cardio. This is no walk in the park, and is not a good beginning tape, but if you really want to sweat, this is a great video."
3,Not the controller i ordered !,"I though i was getting the controller pictured (orange with silver high lights) advertised with an 8 foot long cord. Instead all i got was a normal ugly generic (ORANGE) gamecube controller.I cant really say more about this controller pictured,My advice !Get an original controller used or new with an extension cord cause thats what i'll be buy next time.CASE CLOSED"
2,Short term,"This product offered me short term results, I wanted to use it to start the weight loss as soon as I could. I had read articles that stated it was an unknow product because there is no way to measure the amount per patch of the active ingrediants, that concerns me a bit. It seems that the best places to put the patch are on places, like your back or shoulders. If I applied them at 8am they were falling off by 6pm because of the water that builds up under them."
2,The effects of a bandaid.,Still looking to drop a few pounds easily without less eating and exercising? Well you may as well use band aids. For me this was a waste of money. It didn't do anything for me.
1,No more useful than a band aid!!!,"This is the worst investment of $15.00 I have ever made!!! Please save yourself the grief, expense and headache and do not order this product!!! Buy a package of band aids instead, they work just as well!!! I even tried using more than one patch at a time, with no effect. I don't have a lot of weight to lose, but this is no more helpful than sticking a band aid on my skin :("
5,Moody Blues live,Great concert sights and sounds. Felt like I was right there at the concert. Recommend this very highly. Wow. Wow.
3,Not up to todays concert footage,"If you like the Moodies which was probably one of the best live performing bands, the footage really doesn't make it."
3,The Moody Blues was a great group,"The Moody Blues, what a group they were, before Mike Pinder left.These are fantastic Moody Blues albums. Then they took a tumble.1965: The Magnificent Moodies1967: Days of Future Passed1968: In Search of the Lost Chord1969: On the Threshold of a Dream1969: To Our Children's Children's Children1970: A Question of Balance1971: Every Good Boy Deserves Favour1972: Seventh SojournThis DVD shows what happens to many big hit groups over time. A sad performance by one of the greatest rock groups ever. Could they even get a gig as a warm up band for someone like the Rolling Stones today? The Moodies at Vegas should be their next venture. Out of respect to a one time great band, I give them three flaming chilies."
1,Forget-about-it,"Within ten minutes of viewing this abortion of a production, I ejected the disc and ran it through my document shredder as to destroy the evidence that it ever existed. I did so as not to soil my complete collection of the truly great work they have accomplished. This was without a doubt the worst DVD in the universe. I cannot believe for one moment that this was endorsed by the group -- for if they had any connection with it and any sense -- they would have purchased back the rights and destroyed it themselves. Yes folks, it was that bad."
3,metswin,"Yea no doubt lets not put all the blame on Evans, that BS. They were both young so lets not get carried away and paint her as Mother Teresa. Everyone wants to paint her as this poor innocent girl that had nothing to do with the murder. She beat the crap out of her sister so she wouldnt go to the cops, she put the body in the trunk of a car and drove around for days with the body inside. The girl got what she deserved and its a shame shes out today. She should still be locked up just as long as Evans. She got off because shes a girl and thats sexist. And I too know the case and parties involved, and thought the book was pretty acurate with the exception that Evans was not this monster that the book made him out to be."
4,A Good One!,"About ten years ago, I wanted to get into some jazz after playing in several rock bands. I hooked up with a guitar teacher, and he made me get this book. I dropped the teacher after three lessons, because I found that I could just follow the book and figure out everything myself. My rock buddies soon started calling me ""Chordzilla.""My only beef with this book is the way it is organized. I would have covered all the upper and lower string chords first and then gotten into the theory explanations. Also, some more exercises would have been helpful.But these shortcomings don't detract from the value of the book. There might be better books out there, but you can't go wrong with this one. It is perfect for intermediate players, but doesn't assume too much."
3,"Good, easy and practice learning book for jazz guitarrist","I think that this book is a good beginners jazz guitarrist option. You can learn easily chords, scales, and jazz and rock progressions."
4,A Good Jazz Guitar Chord Introduction,"This book is highly recommended. The author touches on jazz progressions, rhythms, inversions, substitutions, fingerstyle, chord-melody solos, alterered chords, and a host of other techniques that the novice or intermediate jazz guitarist will find interesting, challanging, and if mastered, very rewarding. To understand the author's theoretical explanations the reader should have rudimentary knowledge of harmony and melody. I found the book to be very useful."
5,One of my best and most used books,"I play many styles of music, but Jazz is my favorite, as the chords are the warmest of them all.You don't need to pound on the guitar, do a bunch of bends, play the same two notes to monotony, or have any accompaniment to sound full bodied and just right all by yourself. Blues does this to a point, but just does not use the full bodied chords that Jazz does.Jazz chords are not necessarily easy, but well worth it once you have them down.The book goes through the types of chord forms until around page 31 and then you are off with the actual progressions.I am an old Wes Montgomery fan and can remember many good times with his music and now I can actually play someof it."
2,Con game,"The product looks just fine and is what I need. The black color is nice and will complement my orange female connectors (20 words). However, this appears to be a con game. Each item, a small coupler costs $1.09, but the shipping for each is $1.40 for a total shipping cost of $14.00, and a total cost of $2.49 per connector. I can buy the male AND female coupler set for $2.50 at my local hardware store."
5,Works flawless so far,"I just want to correct the previous reviewer about the GCS14. He probably has a defective kvm. Mine works flawless. One, I can boot any OS I want in any order. Two, the keyboard key combo (ctrl + alt + shift + ""ID"") works for me.You don't need to have to monitor set to the booting machine. I recommend however that you do so when using any kvm machine. It help the operating system detect the correct devices (monitor, keyboard, and mouse) attached. If you don't, they OS will load the generic drivers for mouse, keyboard, and plug'n play monitor. This is perfectly logical."
2,Disappointing,I had high hopes for this one since I'm a Zagat junky. It's already out of date and there was too much space devoted to chain stores. Little treasures that I know of were left out. I guess that will keep tourists from invading them though.
3,Good first in a series,"Abigail Timberlake runs an antique store called Den of Antiquity, which she sometimes refers to as as a den of ""iniquity"". She is surrounded by a cast of interesting characters, her mama who resembles June Cleaver, her Aunt Marilyn Monroe who claims to have been the inspiration for a more well known Marilyn Monore, her on again off again friend Greg Washburn who resembles Gary Grant in more ways than one, and an eclectic group of antique store owners in Charlotte, North Carolina. I enjoyed this first in a series of four (so far) books by Ms Myers. It was hard to put it down. I recommend it to everyone."
2,Tamar needs an editor,"I agree that the dialogue is humorous, but there were some flaws that drove me crazy. First of all, I've never seen a bell pull that was narrow and flexible enough to strangle anyone. Then Abigail says she got a customer's phone number when she charged a purchase--later she says the woman always pays cash. The cover blurb says the aunt had a lace collection, when she actually had only one priceless piece. And of course we know where it was hidden, because that's rather obvious. And how did the murderer get it? Some of the writers that Myers admires, Aaron Elkins and Nevada Barr, do a better job with the details that make a good mystery. Mistakes like hers are very distracting."
4,That's what I'm looking for,"After reading several poor to terrible mysteries in the last few weeks I was thrilled to come across Larceny and Old Lace. It's a delicious ""cozy"" mystery that features a spunky, opinionated, bold heroine who runs an antique shop and lives in one of my favorite places, upstate South Carolina. From the very first line I was hooked. The book features huge chunks of laugh out loud hunmor, kooky characters and a web of clues, twists and turns. There's only one thing I didn't like: The killer turned out to be the one stereoytpe in the book. Making this person the villain was way too easy and seemed like an act of literary laziness to me. However, I love Tamar Myers's work. She's obviously done her research and has managed to pull of mystery with a dose of humor very well."
2,"As a mystery lover and an antiques lover, I was disappointed","I had high hopes for this book, but unfortunately I was let down. I was hoping for more details about antiques and the antiques business, but I didn't get them. The ""whodunnit"" was also a let down. The only saving grace for this book was the humor. The humor is the only reason I'll read the next in the series."
2,Just OK,Good for reading on a plane or vacation. Silly and predictable. NOT PLANNING TO READ the other books in the series .
5,History at its best.,"I saw the movie and loved it. I bought the book and I've read it five times. Through the eyes of Maggie Rogers and her daughter Lillian Rogers Parks, one gets a behind the office look at some remarkable men and women who lived in the White House. Gwen Bagni and Paul Dubov did at great job turning memories into a ""I can't put it down novel.&quot"
3,Its ok,Dog didnt seem to like it too much. Its too hard to find any where else but costs too much to ship it. I guess Im going with another brand.
4,Nice to hear Joe again,"Two artists you could tell were REALLY from the south when you heard their songs on the radio in late '60s were Joe South and Tony Joe White. Even a city boy from Illinois could tell these two guys were the real deal. Listening to these two records on one CD now makes one realize just how genuinely American a song-writer Joe South was. To hear songs like Gabriel and Hole in Your Soul without surface noise is a dream come true. Joe's voice was always very distinctive and never phony-sounding like John Fogerty's, and hearing it again in these well-crafted songs has made my day. Great stuff! The only complaint I have is of the Aussie liner-note writer who criticized (and got it completely wrong) ""A Million Miles Away"" as a pro-Nixon song. Thanks, though, to Raven for getting these two wonderful American records onto CD together."
4,dr. jenkins and mr. hyde,"gelsey writes yet another mystery involving the mystery inc. gang. in this one, scooby and the gang must stop a monster before he poisons all of Yummy's new food. this books includes lot of scared pants, scooby snack loving scooby doo. best of all, you get to be part of the gang. they show you clues and suspects and gives you a chance to see who the monster is before they tell you."
4,A quality Taschen book!,"Taschen books are always such eye candy, couple the Taschen name with 1000 designer chairs and you have a strong visual reference guide to over 100 years of design of chairs.Although 1000 chairs seems like a lot you breeze through the decades and it leaves you wanting more. This book is lacking if you are an aficionado of any one era as there are more specialized books that could detail that era better but as an overall history this book hits the mark."
5,Great Book,This book has pictures of 1000 different kinds of chairs and is a great resource. It has adequate information about Eames chairs which have become known worldwide. It has many other kinds of chairs including some very exotic chairs.
4,Picture Book,"If you just want to see alot of chairs with basic information, this is the way to go. Real pretty."
1,I945GTT-VFA,"I would have liked to have reviewed this item but I was shipped the wrong motherboard. After returning the wrong motherboard I received credit but I found out that the one I wanted is no longer available,"
3,shop lights,After the second arrived i did get to see the lights work. I am over all pleased with my purchase and would recomend this product.
3,"Great UPS for the $, but...","I'm pretty happy with this UPS. This is my 3rd one and this is by far the largest. I use it for a single desktop, with a tone of accessories around it, not just the PC. It worked great right out of the box, but the only complaint I would have is the duration of the battery is far less than expected. The software that comes with it is nice at it will indicate the current load and the estimated run time. Base on that, with a ~25% load, I only get ~11 minutes worth of run time which is far less than what they advertize...Still gets the job done for the occational power glitch."
1,Died and zapped my computer,I recommend avoiding this brand. My UPS died and apparently took my computer out as well. Neither the UPS or the computer will power up.
2,Wouldn't buy another one.,"Bought several of these and have had problems with 2 of them. Worked for less than a year. Even with no power loss, equipment that is attached to the unit, just shuts down. Maybe the battery has gone bad already? Not really sure, but it doesn't compare to other Backup brands that I have purchased."
5,Great value!,We bought 3 of these so we could plug in our computer and both of our Playstation 3's. They all work great so far!
3,"Pleasantly surprised, an engaging read","While not what I normally read, I picked up Bone Walk because of the local buzz about it. The plot is complex but the author did an excellent job of keeping it all straight. Characters are well developed. It's a good novel, one worth your time."
5,Excullent!,"There isn't much i can say about this video simply that it is great i've whatched it at lest 6 0r 7 times aleady and still can't get a enough of it there a presentaion don't by Gerald r Ford in it talking about Shirley both as a Child Star and as an ambassader because she served with him win he was Presadent and many other things, i get very choked up each time i watch it Shirley Temple is my best in the whole world so i would offer this to any fan who loves Shirley as much as i do thanks Wilson r Tibbo jr"
3,"Ok, but could break your Cube",Well first of this thing messed up my cube and so i had to buy a new one. But after a wile it comes in handy on long trips. Over all don't buy it unless you want to by a new game cube.
4,"Nice, sturdy and great for filing","Each of the 10 jackets is very nice and sturdy. Like they say, it can expand up to 2 inches. I use this for separating out sheet music.The only minor complaints are the price (I think it shouldn't be more than 10 bucks) and the fact that it's not 12 folders instead of 10. I know of some people who like to have a folder of stuff for each month.But still, I recommend this. Great for filing many things!"
4,"Sturdy, basic, wider folder. Does the job","These are sturdy manila folders made of good heavy stock. They have a folded bottom so they open to about a 1/2"" rectangle, which makes them much more versatile than a regular flat folder. Be aware that when completely unexpanded, they still take up more thickness than a flat folder in your drawer."
3,Expected more,"I have used a variety of file ""jackets"" over the years to contain even the smallest pieces of paper in my filing cabinet, but find most of them are not of sufficient quality when compared to the price. Paying over a dollar a piece for a folder seems like highway robbery to me, especially when the folder does not hold up well from the start. I have actually experienced worse issues with other similar products (e.g. poorly glued joints, glue which becomes ineffective in a few weeks/months, etc.) but that does not distract from the fact these also have issues with robustness. I do like these particular folders more than others I have used in the past because they seem like they may be bit more reliable long term, but they still did not meet my expectations for a product with such a high price tag."
4,Good size,"These file jackets are the perfect solution for the office or for large home files (medical records, taxes). They extend up to two inches and are very sturdy. They are the same material as a regular file folder. But, these protect your files from bent corners. They are also especially helpful to keep papers from falling off. This is a good solution for home or office (I am currently using it for the office).They seem durable. Not as durable as a redwell folder but it does the job."
3,"Alas, falls short of perfect","File jackets are hugely practical for corraling receipts, envelopes, and notes on scraps of paper; much more so than regular old file folders which have a tendency to release their contents at the most inopportune moments. On that level, these jackets deliver.Where they don't deliver is in their sturdiness. The corners are quite flimsy and show gaps. Yes, the tabs are reinforced, but the corners need the extra material much more than the tabs. When expanded the full two inches, the corners threaten to come apart.I wanted these to be the Holy Grail of file jackets but am afraid they're merely average."
4,Useful and Durable,"I found these expansion file jackets to be just what I thought they were, a nice and easy way to store files that require a little extra space. The way the papers are boxed in, you can also file things that might not be regular paper size like receipts or pictures and they won't fall out. They are manila in color and short of wearing them out by time or getting them wet, they should hold up to your daily grind. Perfect for putting in a file drawer where you need things to stand up straight. I like that the tops are reinforced so as not to wear out as fast in the file drawer."
5,File Jacket,"Good size for keeping documents together in one place. The expandable file jacket will fit into the file cabinet. You can also carry them keeping papers from falling out, as in the case of standard folders.Heavy weight, should last a while."
3,Expansion is a bit clumsy,"So the great thing about these folders is that they hold more due to the expansion, but the expansion is clumsy at best. If you don't expand it, the papers get tangled in the folded corners. If you do expand it, it is easily crushed. The plus is that it can be broken down and stored in the space of a regular manila folder, but if you need expanded size, the accordion folders will work better for you and last longer."
3,Ok movie,"I don't think that this would be one of the best, but it is funny. I watched without any problems, I really don't have anything bad to say, just that it is not the best movie, but good enogh to give it a try.*Sponsored Post"
1,sorry....not much here,"Mr Amos....boy, what a upbringing you must've had! Maybe, sometimes in life, when you dont expect much you CAN get even less than that ! LOL"
3,Small Photos,"I am a serious collector of photography. Having recently acquired a Stephen Strom photograph, the book was purchased to see more of his work. Amazon description says the book is 10.1 x 9.9 inches, which it is. Problem is that all of the images reproduced in the book are very tiny (think trading card size), surrounded by huge borders (or in the middle of text, which is okay). Pictures are beautiful, but why the editors decided to make them so small is a real mystery."
3,The magnets should be stronger.,"This is a promising toy with a simple design - a two-page fold-out magnetized diorama with magnetic cut-out paper princess dolls and various accessories (fans, flowers, jewelry, tiaras, etc.) The big problem is that the magnets are not strong enough -- they stick to the background, but just barely. We bougt this for road trips, and were disappointed to find how easily pieces slid off the pages and were lost. Also, the pieces have large borders, so it is more difficult to create the illusion of reality than it should be. My kid plays with this from time to time, but it's hardly her favorite toy."
5,"Comfortable, Fast Shipping, but make sure you know what color you want","Pads are comfortable. Seller even changed an address for me after it was about to be shipped upon my request.Make sure you know what color you want though: it appears black on a picture, but actually I got dark blue - which I personally liked."
4,Comfortable and solid,I bought these for myKinesis Freestyle Solo Ergonomic USB Keyboard - Black. They work great for any split keyboard. The gel bottom really sticks wherever you put it with no sliding around. My only compliant is that they had a strong odor for the first month or so. You may want to let these air out with the bottoms up for quite awhile before using.
5,Excellent sound card considering $$,"Just purchased the Riviera just over a month ago and i'm quite impressed with it's performance espically taking into consideration the price. There are fancier sound cards out there, but if your looking to upgrade from ""on-board"" sound, this is the best one out there."
3,Turtle Beach Sound Card,Easy to set up although direction were some what confusing. Good software suite and adequate sound reproduction. I mostly use it for games and mp3's.
2,"Adequate performance, dishonest marketing","The card was easy to install and so far seems to work with all applications tested. However, several software titles that are clearly promised on the outside of the box, including ""Record Producer LE, Music Write LE, and SoundCheck"" are not on the installation disc. This is simply not honest. In the future I'll prefer to do business with a company that delivers what they promise."
5,Wonderful,"When I upgraded my desktop to Windows 7, I needed to update my sound system. This product is works great and satisifies the compatibility requirements for Windows 7. I installed the board and the drivers, and the computer took care of the rest. It was very easy to install. Very happy with the product!"
1,Poor Driver Support (No 64 bit Drivers),"Come on Turtle Beach!!! 64bit OS's have been out for over 5 years not and you still don't have a 64bit driver for this card that hasn't changed much since 2001? No where in the Amazon write up or on the box of the product or even in there help forums do they say there is no 64bit support. Heck the installer even runs without throwing an error. I spent 2 hours troubleshooting and to find out there are no 64bit drivers. Gah, buy the audiology."
1,Couldn't get it to work,Buy a Sound Blaster Audigy. This card wouldn't work after hours of trying. The SB card took two minutes to install.
5,Big Sound for a Small Price,"I've used Turtle Beach sound cards for quite some time. Their quality is superb; preferable over comparible Sound Blaster cards. Riviera provides all of the features I'm looking for in Digital Input/Output, as well as superb Legacy support (for older computer applications and games designed for DOS.) Turtle Beach online support has always been very good, as well."
2,Not as good as a Sound Blaster,"In my Dell, this sound card had too much floor noise for recording. I upgraded to a sound blaster and got a -95db."
1,MASSIVELY LAME,"Save your $14.95 and skip this self-promoting piece of hally-hoo. Deborah Jenkins lacks a creative, independence voice, void of significance. I wish there were less than 1 star available, b/c I would rate a big fat ZERO! Trust me, move on--there are LOADS more books in the world that would serve a reader better than this robotic text. YAWN."
3,Cast and crew really DO write reviews,"I soooooo wanted to like this movie. But it's a pg-13 failure. Not vulgar enough for the Troma seal of approval that it managed to get, not funny enough to be low-brow comedy, not violent enough to be a cult classic. And I'm sorry, I can not get past the fact that real dead raccoons are the props. If you're going to do that, you HAVE to justify it with cleverness, nudity/sex, or really poorly shot violence. I gave 3 stars because I know I'm going to see the next film from these guys. Because they seem to be awesomely talented and funny - this film kinda suggests that - and that movie will be first on my list. But coming from someone who thinks Toxic Avenger and Yeti are classics...I can't push this one,."
5,Fantastic,"Some of the best humour from Argentina. The Spanish can be a bit Buenos Aires-specific so you might miss some jokes if you are not porteño, but most of it is quite universal and that fine combination of intellectual and silly that cracks me up."
4,100 Excellent Lessons,"Jane Pollak has captured the essence of being an entrepreneur. Through insight, candor and example she illustrates all of the ups and downs of building a business. Her format is an excellent example in simplicity. The lesson to be learned is clearly and concisely presented at the top of each page and then a real-life example is presented in the body of the text. I read it through, the first time,in just two easy sittings. It is packed with honest and straightforward samplings of events that every entrepreneur in any field of endeavor has (or will) encounter. This book is entertaining, educational and inspiring. I recommend it to any aspiring entrepreneur!"
1,Don't waste your money,"In a portion of the book, Ms. Pollak describes an incident where someone came up to her and told her that during her speech her examples were trivial, this person could not have been more right.As an entrepreneur, I cannot believe the hype over this book from the reviews here to the Today show. This book left me turning from page to page, thinking there was something enlightening coming somewhere right up and until the end of the book.I would only recommend this book for the fresh out of college, any seasoned entrepreneur knows 150% more than what is in this book."
4,Effective learning tool.,"I used this video and the accompanying workbook to prepare for the CLEP ""Introduction to Psychology"" exam, and I found it to be a valuable preparation tool. While the tape doesn't cover every single concept covered in the CLEP exam, it does cover most of the important concepts covered in an introductory pychology course. While the presenters in the video probably shouldn't try for careers as stand-up comics, the humorous asides included in the video make it much less dry than the typical ""talking heads"" presentation. All-in-all, this video is a great introduction to introductory psychology, and a more than adequate exam review."
2,"Not the best, but hard to find psych videos!","I'm a high school psychology teacher and I purchased this DVD for my classroom. It covers pretty much the entire psych. curriculum but the DVD menu does not allow you to choose specific topics which is not convenient or practical at all!!! Its pretty cheesy and you can tell it was filmed several years ago (its the same VHS footage, just put on DVD). However, it is SO hard to find educational psych. videos for the classroom I still purchased it for my collection!"
2,Not worth the money,For the amount this company charges for a body pillow it is definately not worth it. One week is all it took for this body pillow to loose it shape. The only good thing about this product is the Steelers logo on it. Dont waste your money on this product. NOT WORTH IT!
4,Great Product!,"Heating the water you're circulating instead of just heating a corner of the tank...what a great idea! Use with the matching Rena smartfilter to circulate your heated water throughout the tank.Instructions say to set it up and wait 12 hours...good advice. At first it wasn't regulating temp, the light wasn't even coming on. The next day I thought it wasn't working. I tried adjusting the temp control by only one degree and that must have kicked in the circuits because it immediately turned on and stayed on until it pegged the temp I'd asked for.Now, 2 weeks later and the temperature is nice and steady at 78 degrees."
3,"A bit bulky, but works.","I purchased this about a year ago. Most of the time it works great, however I do have problems with it communicating with my Pioneer head unit. I'm really not sure why, it just seems to have a bad connection every once in a while for some odd reason. Other than that, and the fact that it is a bit bulky, it's a descent product."
2,not compatible,"i was told this remote works for the AVH DVD, but when i used it only the volume and source buttons work. check functions first"
1,Does not work with BTz130,Does not work with the Pioneer Z130 so beware. Thas all dont know how well it works for other. But when I bought it it was advertised as compatible with the BTZ130
4,Nice remote,"Decent remote w basic functions to control my pioneer touch screen in-dash while I am driving to change station, change track, mute and volume up and down all other functions do not work since they are not used. Also you can control all your basic dvd functions."
2,too big,"This is one huge remote for a car! My tv remote is smaller than this lol. All it does is control the volume and skip songs. Nothing else, cant even do settings. Useless"
4,Good Investment,I bought this remote for a Pioneer AV4000 I beleive anyway the radio is a touchscreen and I put in my wifes truck and I didn't want to mess it up so I bought this remote and it works great. There was only two problems with that I didn't like. 1)It has 3 settings on the side of it for different devices (didn't know that at first)and I hit the switch and my wife said it stopped working. Once I realized what happened I fixed it and showed her now there is no problem. 2)I like to adjust the EQ on the unit but the remote will not go to that feature so I do it manually. Besides that I love it cause this will extend the life of the radion cause I don't need to touch it as much
2,Doesn't do Much,"I wanted a remote to turn the volume up, change radio stations and operate the DVDs. This remote it bulky and I can't even scroll through preset radio stattions. Can I have my money back and keep the item please?"
4,Its fine,"It does what it is suppost to do. Controling Volume, switching songs, and total movies control. IPod Owners it does not get u to switch playlist and stuff from ur ipod u have to do it from the screen of the unit."
4,Remote funtions as promised,"I got this remote mostly for making DVD watching easier (the touchscreen controls are pains in the butt to get to) and it certainly has done that. It's a little bulkier than I was expecting, but not too bad."
2,Don't buy if you have AVH-4000,"I bought this to use with my Pioneer AVH-4000 and it sucks. Only about 10% of the buttons are even used. The remote is HUGE and wierd. It cannot adjust any of the audio functions, it cannot hit menu/back button, I still have to touch the screen just as much as I used to without the remote. Its only $15, but I regret buying it."
1,Do not BUy,this is nice if you are not driving. The butons are to hard to find quickly and most of th features do not work. I purchased the AVH-p4200 and wanted somthing to minimize the use of the touch screen well I wasted my money I should have put it towards the Bluetooth or somthing that worked. save your $$$$$$$Pioneer CD-R55 Remote Control
4,Works pretty good,"Although it was not something I expected, this remote control works well so far. I wanted a control that could work with the iPod as well. However, this one does not. Good product; does not meet my expectations."
3,Pioneer Car CDR55 Remote,"control is useful and works well, but we can not handle audio options, and functions from remote cotrol."
5,Pioneer remote,"The unit is for my Suburban Pioneer DVD unit. Remote works great, looks great, fits perfectly in my top console for use."
3,Pioneer CD-R55 Remote,"Used with my Pioneer AVH P4000 and some of the buttons utilize the features on my receiver, but some of the buttons on the remote don't do anything at all."
4,Does the job.,"A bit bulky but does the job. It would be nice if they made it a bit smaller so that it would be more practical, particularly when using in the car."
2,"In retrospect, I did not need this but hindsight is 20/20!","My title says it all. The remote works, although I still have not figured out how to operate all of the functions of the stereo system using the remote."
2,ok product,"I really wanted a remote for my car but this didn't do it for me. All I really need is volume and the skip forward and back buttons. It works as advertised but is just too big and there are too many buttons to use while I'm driving. It would however, work great if you like to watch a lot of dvds in your car."
3,It could have been better!!,"Ok, the basic storyline was good but in my opinion it was not written out in the best way! I liked Sionna's character. David's character was a little soft, but ok! I felt like Mayhew spent to much time on David's ex, Jaunice. I did not know if I should feel sorry for Jaunice or to like her! But this is just my opinion!"
5,Fun for Original Avengers fans,"I am a long time fan of The Avengers. While I have been primarily interested in the Emma Peel episodes, I found the Cathy Gale episodes interesting, too. The quality of the episodes isn't as sharp as I would like, but one must consider how long ago they were made (47 years).I am glad to add them to my collection of The Avengers DVD's."
5,What is that on the TV Cathy?,"If you relish a series like ""Honey West,"" ""Peter Gunn"" or ""77 Sunset Strip"" you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. Like John Steed (Patrick Macnee) might say to Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman), ""You scratch my hat and I'll scratch your, well what ever. Just watch the umbrella please."" John and Cathy Gale are back and are here to stay via DVD's digital technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. Steed they look good, very good old boy."
1,My Pops is Still Dead,"I ain't one for that book learnin, but when my pops croaked I stole this book from the store and I was pissed. It don't say nothing about bringin pops back to life."
4,Works well and fast.,"I have a Lenovo X230 laptop running Win7 64bit. I was unable to install the card manually by downloading drivers from SYBA's website. It just wouldn't work. However when I allowed Windows Update to find and install drivers automatically it worked without a hitch.The card now works perfectly. I transferred 70GB of data from my laptop's internal SSD to an external 5400RPM HD. The transfer started at about 120MB per second. It was great but short lived, the transfer rate began to slow down incrementally. It eventually settled to about a 55MB per second sustained transfer rate. Which is still the fastest connection I've ever achieved backing up my files. Using USB 2.0 for me is about 30MB per second. And transferring files to a NAS over my wireless network is about 16MB per second."
5,Great Product,"Typical Amazon product. It is delivered quickly, does exactly what it says it does. The transfer speed is so much faster than USB."
1,Loose Expresscard,"This item refuses to stay in your computer, there is not latching or locking in.It slides out as easily as it slides in and therfore was a waste of my money as i purchased another product that did lock in."
1,Cotton Eye Joe,"I bought this cd to use in amateur dance class in rv park. Received on time. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this cd. There are a couple of usuable tracks for dancing the Cotton Eye Joe. I did not like any of the remaining tracks."
2,Doesn't cut it,This CD was supposed to replace an old REDNEX cassette tape and it's a pretty awful collection of material - the recording quality of which is very poor.
2,Mel Brooks Is Very Funny,"Yes thats right Mel Brooks is on top form, but the trobble is his co star Ezio Greggio is about as funny as a nose bleed, he has a complete lack of comic timing and no directing skills. This film would have been a comedy gem if Mel Brooks' talent had been able to take center stage more and it had some one else in Ezio Greggio part.Its a shame to see what could have been a very good and funny film turn into total crud."
4,Screw Loose,Outstanding!!!!! Brilliant sense of humor and perfect performance of actors. Telling the truth. We love Mel Brooks !! A lot of dialogues written by him are being used by our family as sort of our private internal language.
1,Mel Brooks..........WHY????,I saw that this movie had Mel Brooks in it. I love Mel Brooks and all of his old movies. But this show has no point. It was horrible. Ezio Greggio was funny in Silence of the Hams. But this.....YUK!!!
4,Funny,I loved this one. It was funny. Mel Brooks is funny as ever in this movie. That topless scene was funny....PS: I would reccomend it to people who like Mel Brooks
5,Stand up Comedy Hosted by Howie Mandel,"""Well Developed"" is the first video in a series of hilarious comedy videos starring America's funnist up-and-coming stand up comics. Certifiable madman Howie Mandel hosts the show which includes the following spectacularly strange events: Bruce Mahler's singing checken; Judy Carter's famous dress shield escape; Philip Wellford's flaming touch final; and a quick look inside the twisted mind of Bob Saget."
1,The Worst Teach Yourself Book,"This is by far the worst teach yourself book I have ever read. Irish is a very beautiful language but it has very difficult pronunciation, you have to practice for months before you can predict the pronunciation of a word. This book has a pronunciation section with cassettes, you hear a word said by a native speaker, but you have no idea how it's written, it is not in the book!!! The book is a complete disorder in this section. The Grammar explanations are a joke too.I have used very good TY books like TY Czech, Hindi, Finnish, Hungarian, Sanskrit, Danish, Russian, Dutch, or modern Greek; and very bad ones like TY Romanian or Polish; but this is the worst so far. This book is amazingly far, far below TY standards."
3,"Fun, but not what it shows","I bought this at a store rather then Amazon. I followed all directions and all of the stones grew something on them, but it's not like the pictures they show you. Buyer beware, but I guess for the price it's worth experimenting."
1,big disappointment,We followed the directions and absolutely no crystals formed on the rocks provided nor on our own rocks. Don't buy this product. My chidren were very disappointed. the pictures on the box do NOT tell the story.
5,Contains all of these 8 albums,"Contains the contents from 8 original albums, some otherwise currently unavailable. I found the following list here: [...]# Modern Jazz Quartet/Milt Jackson Quintet (Prestige 7059, 1952)# Sonny Rollins with the Modern Jazz Quartet (Prestige 7029, 1953)# Django (Prestige 7057, 1953)# Concorde (Prestige 7005, 1955)# The Modern Jazz Quartet Reunion at Budokan 1981 (Pablo 2308-243, 1981)# Together Again/Modern Jazz Quartet Love at the Montreux Jazz Festival 1982 (Pablo 2308-244, 1982)# ""Echoes"" The Modern Jazz Quartet 1984--Together Again (Pablo 2312-142, 1984# ""Topsy"" This One's for Basie (Pablo 2310-917, 1985)"
4,Good enough,This set is fun and has a lot of different pieces. It isn't super sturdy but there's enough that will last that it is worth the money.
3,"Good, but outdated. Be sure to check copyright date.","Seriously needs updating. It was a good guide when it was assembled and provided a lot of information, although I was disappointed that some trails were not included. This is a good start but leaves a lot to be desired."
3,Well thought out but has some issues,"This book was composed with integrity with which readers can identify with the quality of writing invested into this book. As others have written, he does a great job of briefing you on the trail before you endeavor to conquer it. But I must say, once I decided I wanted to try out a trail, his rather perplexing and redundant directions made it harder than it needed to be to locate the trail head. For example he would mention non-existant loops or landmarks. He also used ostentations and redundant directions such as ""a wooded glade."" Great, now I just have to pass the round wheel and the hard rock, missing the wet water and avoiding the hot fire ;-P. But for 6 bucks... not too horribly bad."
5,Gary Gilmore's Fight To Die,"In typical Biography fashion, the story of Gary Gilmore and Nicole Baker is told with impeccable style, encompassing the feelings of not only Gary Gilmore, but of his friends, family, lawyers, and his girlfriend, Nicole Baker. The heartbreaking story of the first person to be executed in the United States after the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976, ""Gary Gilmore: A Fight To Die"" stands on its own as one of the most compelling news stories of the 20th century."
1,Play Station 2 remote control,It does not work and have not gotten response from seller in what and how to make it work since it came with no instructions
1,Nice Idea/Bad Construction,I was excited to use my magnafish. The first time I used it the chain broke and I had to cut a hole in the wall to get it out. Very flimmsy chain and now I dont want to use it. You guys need to get a better chain on this.
4,Real ACTION the whole way through!,"WOW, what a movie. This got my ""atention"" every time I watched it!!"
2,"Santaland, Yes!; This Script, No!","""The Santaland Diaries"" is superlative satire. The words bristle and delight. Sedaris is a genuine American voice -- witty, sardonic, removed, unpredictable. I have seen ""Santaland"" work on stage many times. Way funny stuff.However, don't read a script when you can read the original prose (available in at least 3 different paperbacks.) You could even track down Sedaris reading it aloud. DPS is one of the great publishers in the history of the theatre, but a script is a backwards way to encounter ""Santaland"" on the page.As far as ""Seasons Greetings"" goes, well, let's just say that this is not a piece of writing for the ages."
2,A little too metro,"My hubby was not thrilled with this gift. It looked too feminine. I agreed. It is nice and soft, but too thin. We gave it to goodwill. He never wore it."
3,not so thrilling...,Good information for the course I was taking... but I wouldn't read it if I didn't have to.
5,Very Good Anti-Seize Compound,"I have used this stuff for years and it works very well. My first experience was for use on stainless steel mounting hardware in a wet location. We had issues with the parts galling and being very hard to take apart again. We started using this compound and never had an issue again. Also, since it is rated for very high temperatures, it works well on auto brake hardware (use sparingly). Highly Recommended!"
5,Steel Leather and an Umbrella Cathy?,"If you relish a series like ""Honey West,"" ""Peter Gunn"" or ""77 Sunset Strip"" you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. Like John Steed (Patrick Macnee) might say to Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman), ""You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back. Just watch the hat please."" John and Cathy Gale are back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. They look good, very good."
4,Strangers on a Bridge,"This is a forgotten Cold War gem!... Anyone with an interest in Cold War history, spies, and the law will find this book great reading. It tells the story of James Donovan (in his own words), a prominent New York attorney in the late 1950s, who was asked by the government to defend Rudolf Abel, an extremely successful Soviet spy who operated in the New York city area. The book is part diary, part biography and part spy narrative. You get to see the conflict that he goes through as a former Naval officer and the whirlwind he gets caught up in. What makes this different from other books is that it was written very soon after the events occurred. His trip to Berlin is one of the most interesting features of the book because you get an eyewitness account of the city at the height of the tensions between the Soviets and the U.S."
3,One of my son's favorites,"My 4-year old loves this toy. He is fascinated by anything space-related, and I figured it would be a good idea to mix in a few toys of vehicles that actually exist. He seems to get more a thrill out of seeing space shuttles on TV after playing with this, and is obsessed with the functionality of each part.The toy isn't terribly well made however. The doors look like they will break off eventually, and it has already lost a wheel. The booster rockets may also separate at some point.Still, I think this is worth considering. Even if it doesn't last forever, my son has already enjoyed it enough to justify the cost."
2,Poor construction,Small pieces that break off easily. If you have a kid that actually wants to PLAY with a toy - this is NOT the toy for them. Better suited to just look at but what kid wants to do that?
3,great little boys toy sparks the imagination and conversation,"My 4 year old was very excited to receive this rocket, unfortunately the tail was not stuck to the shuttle very well and it busted off the first time he dropped it. We have glued it back on and it now functions very well. It also does come apart from the booster rockets rather easily so it has to be flown with two hands. But apart from these faults it is a very well utilised toy and much loved."
3,Good miniature but...,"I am quite disappointed by the connection between space shuttle and tank/boosters. It is really not holding when my son is playing with it, and i beleive that by trying to put back it will wear ( or even broke ) and it won't even be possible to keep them togheter on the launch pad.Good thing, quite realsitic is the folding landing gears, allowing to simulate/play the re-entry and landing."
4,Nice basic stopwatch w/ backlight,"I ordered the Alpha Sport Stopwatch 410 on August 3, 2011 the first batch arrive on September 2, 2011 in excellent condition.First impression is they feel solid and have a comfortable rubber like exterior that is easy to grip. The buttons make a clicking sound and provide a nice tactile response. The backlight is a nice touch.Features:Stopwatch, 12 or 24 hour Clock w/ day- month-year, alarm-chime, and blue backlight, split time, and detachable lanyard.I have no idea how long these will last in a school environment used by instructors and student teachers but if they last these will be a great purchase for just under $15.00.Pros:Good weight and feel.Easy to grip.Solid large buttons.Backlight.Detachable lanyard.Large display and easy to read.Clock.Split timeCons:1 out of 6 arrived with dead battery.Does not remember time splits."
2,really nice quality but...,"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of these tables. The iron legs were very attractive and the tops were a good weight and nicely finished but the stain of the wood was a bright orange color, not what I was expecting at all. If your home has a lot of orange it might work well, otherwise it might stand out and appear garish as it did in my apartment. Too bad, because had this set been stained with a more neutral shade as it appears in the photo, it would have been perfect! needless to say, I returned it."
3,BEWARE....This is NOT Pacific Silvercloth,"This ""silvercloth"" does not use impregnated silver to block tarnish, and thus is not good for as long as it is intact. Take the extra time to Google ""Pacific Silvercloth"" to get the best. They even pre-sew it to fit your silver!"
2,"not great, but there's nothing else","if you're a johnny winter fan, you should have this. i have been a fan of johnny winter since the late 60's. he was awesome. the last time i saw him was a couple years ago sitting in a chair playing so wonderfully. this video is the best there is i guess. on some songs the quality of the video is good, but the music just isn't great. on others it's a great song, but the quality of the video and the audio sucks. mediochre videos. i'd like to have a video of him today with a good backing band but a high quality video. if you're a johnny winter fan, you should have this. but don't expect too much."
4,Johnny Winter in the 70's,"Johnny Winter is a favorite who never strayed too far away from his his originals.While a fine capable,musician, Edgar is prone to going over the top to the point of irritation.Good that he doesn't try that here. He seems to be willing to assume a background position hereand let his older brother shine. Mean Town Blues............great, great song."
5,Winter live the 70s,i own a few JW DVDS..THIS IS THE BEST BAR NONE...Jhonny at his best vibrant and full of energy..A+A
2,Don't bother,"Despite some negative reviews, I puchased this video. I did not find it very interesting. It is little more than poor quality audio & video of TV and small european club performances from the 70s. If the quality was better it might be interesting. If you find it anywhere in a $5 bin it might br worth a look."
1,Strange compilation of clips,"Not many real gems here, looks like mostly European gigs and some odd public television stuff.Interesting if your a fan of Johnnys like I am, but disappointing from a performance stand point."
2,Not as good as advertised,"I'm writing this review to give potential buyers a pause in the face of the 5 star reviews that got me clicking the order now button. I am a big fan of Johnny Winter. I've owned many albums and seen him play in a couple clubs years ago in Houston. This dvd has its moments: highlights include Be Careful with a Fool, Mean Town Blues, Stone County, Walking By Myself. Lowlights inferior video quality and an on going interview with a stoned questioner discussing how rock n roll is going wrong and wouldn't it be great to levitate while playing. The price is not bad but I don't see myself jumping through the low points to view this again. Well maybe for Be Careful with a Fool."
1,Bad product,Some of the old plunger caps broke when I changed window screens. So I bought these to replace the whole thing. I was disappointed to find out these plastic plungers are so soft and useless. I ended up keeping the old ones but replacing the caps only. So it was not a complete waste of money.
5,Excellent Text for Applied Risk Engineers,"I work in the field of risk and reliability engineering and I am thoroughly impressed by this book. This is especially useful for engineers who are not used to working with probability theory. Although many of the examples are from the health sciences, the methodology can be applied to engineering problems as well. It's worth the price, though I would like to see more examples using Crystal Ball software. I would also like to see more information on probabilistic risk assessment methods like event trees and it's implementation in Excel / Crystal Ball."
5,Practical Quantitative Risk Analysis,"This is the best guide to date for risk engineers and interdisciplinary quants who are looking for a comprehensive, user-friendly and practical book on fundamentals of risk analysis, modelling and simulations. I recommend the book to anyone interested in learning more about quantitative risk analysis or Monte Carlo modelling. The first part of the book focuses on fundamentals and the second on modelling techniques and simulations. Good examples relating to business, finance, policy and health are included where any Monte Carlo simulation software would be a useful companion."
5,"In depth, detailed, and","This book is not for the faint of heart - you should know statistics and have a very solid math background before you attempt to crack open the cover. While primarily focused on risk analysis within the finance and insurance industries, the principles outlined within can be carried across to other fields such as high-tech fraud. The probability calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and other means of determining likelihood of an event occurring are all covered and will confuse the novice. Containing a slight bias towards Vose consulting services (where the author obviously hails), this book also points out what above-average risk consultation services should do for you, as well as what you, as a hiring manager, should expect.All in all, I find this to be a great resource, and look forward to sharing the book with others in my department that are mathematicians and can truly appreciate the content."
4,Risk Analysis,"A very good book, but a bit too much mathematical detail in deriving formulas for probability distributions; could use better descriptions of when to use each probability distribution."
2,1st edition more useful to a practitioner than the 2nd,"Unlike in the first edition, the author seems to have tried his best to eliminate any reference to any simulation software in the second edition. Result: it now reads like any academic simulation text, only less. The first edition wasn't broke. Why fix it? Bring back the classic Vose!"
1,Don't Bother,"Length:: 1:08 MinsA very heavy read with little immediate insight into the practical measurement of risk, outside of the heavy mathematical models already failing the financial, insurance and project management fields.Best left to those with little else to do or preparing for a masters in mathematics; or less real-world relevant undertakings."
3,"Rating in advance, a great mistake in the description","The description for this item is completely WRONG. Carranza was MEXICAN, not Spanish, there's (literally) an entire ocean of difference. Not only Carranza was Mexican but also he was an officer of the Mexican Air Force. I hope a serious historian could correct this big mistake in the product description. Anyway, I will buy it and I just hope this is a description mistake, hoping this won't show up in the middle of the documentary...a description mistake as ridiculous as the fact that they call us Mexicans ""Hispanics"", since we are not from Spain...or ""Latinos"", since we are not Italians (the real Latinos)."
4,"never heard of ernesto, but really like him","this is the 2nd mp3 download i've purchased from this artist. he was an amazon recomendation for me. his sound on this cd & the 1st one i purchased (can't recall the title, but has a pix of him & a cup of coffee on it) both have a nice r&b sound. perfect for like, sunday mornings or just mellowing out to. do like i did & take a chance, you may find you like this artist. oh, but before you buy any of his music, LISTEN FIRST. not all of his music is like this, some of his music isn't quite my cup of tea, but you might like, but listen to all first."
5,A Very Wonderful & Heartwarming Story!,"I remember reading this book over and over as a small child. I read it so many times that I wore out the binder on the book. It's a story of a small boy and how he builds a flying machine out of scrapes and paints it with all the colors he can find in the family shed and takes off on an adventure around the world. I would love to find this book and keep it around for future generations to read, not only this story but all the other wonderful stories written by Marianna Mayer. Thank you.....C.M....."
1,Unreliable seller,"Was supposed to be shipped by the 2nd of June. Seller did not ship the item unntil the 9th of June, as shown on postage label. Does not respond to e mails"
4,What! Free Fred songs?,"I just download this album. It was free so I figured what have I got to loose. Plus, there was a track by Fred Hammond. That brotha can sing. I'll update later once I've listened to it a few times."
2,Not long enough!!,"After being pleasantly surprised with the A&E biography of her notorious father, Henry VIII, I decided to view the companion biography of Elizabeth I. What I cannot understand is that they devoted around two hours to Henry's biography and only around one hour to Elizabeth's; this coming from the fact that her reign and life were far more illustrious than the Henry's. I just don't know how you sum of the 45 year reign and 69 year old life of England's greatest monarch in about an hour's time.For a much better biography, if you have the time and you want to know more, view ""Elizabeth R"" starring Glenda Jackson. This made for television mini series on different episodes of her life is far superior. If you don't really care that much, but you want her entire life summed up in three sentences, than view this A&E biography."
1,Fiction -- Not Fact,"These historians need to get their facts straight and down to the truth in order to do their job properly. Queen Liz The First, was and will always be one of the great leaders who had ruled upon this earth. Unlike other politicians, she put aside her personal life to serve the lives of the English people. It's upsetting to have these ""so-called"" historians and The A&E Network (whose programs I usually admire) not indulging more of the correct facts about her and The Tudor Lineage. All I can say is...please read up more on her history before speaking and putting together a biography that's biased and not slopped hurredly together. There are much better films out there...few, but there are some. Not worth the $."
3,Good for the classroom,"I use this in my classroom. It shows some of the controversies and scandals leading up to and during Elizabeth I's reign. A lot of these are things you don't read about in the textbooks. My main complaint is that it paints a very critical portrait of the queen. Even though I don't agree with the opinions expressed, I use it to counter my own opinions. I speak very favorably of Queen Elizabeth and then I tell my students that the video shows another view."
4,Enough detail,"This book is very easy to read, gets to the point in simple sentences and almost feels like sitting in a class. The first 30 pages provides an overview of IGBTs. Further details are elaborated in subsequent chapters. I highly recommend this book."
2,A Star Trek parody,"In the early '90s, there were a lot of parody science fiction/ fantasy books. This is a pretty good example of one. If you liked the movie ""Down Periscope"" or if you like books by Craig Shaw Gardner, you will like this book."
4,A good value,I have neck problems and this pillow gives extra support I need. It works well. I recommend it to anyone.
1,Cervical Pillow - Standard - Firm,This is really the best for you if you have a neck pain that persists and don't know why. It helps you sleep correctly and is still soft but firm.
5,A Great Song,"I think this is a really great song. It's one of my favorites by Jessica Simpson. She's got a great voice with a lot of range, and I hope she comes out with more music like this."
3,Not much about technique,"I purchaed these books looking for information on Erikson's hypnotic techniques. I was disappointed in the content of the book. If you want to know more about Erikson's life and some of his explorations into hypnosis, it is good book. If you are wanting to learn more about his technique, look elsewhere."
5,Stylish Information,"The author has done her homework, detailing and distinguishing the nature of the scoop at supreme shops in the East. What elevates this read to something beyond mere (if yummy and useful) information is the elan' of the writing. The author has a knack for language and a very good ear for fresh prose to describe those fresh ingredients. A congenial and well done mix of sleuthing, road trip, and encyclopedia of blissful frozen treats. An enjoyable read!"
4,Ok booster for an older child,"After trying this booster for a couple of days with my almost 4 year old, I transfered him back to his Britax Marathon. Britax is higher, a lot more secure and much more comfortable for the kid. Safety-wise, I found that on longer trips my son would pull his arm from under the seat belt because he was not comfortable, which was not safe, of course. And sleeping is not nearly as comfortable for him as in his Britax. Overall, I am just putting this booster aside for a year or so. I think it is designed for an older child."
5,Best value overall,We took a look at all of the car seats and this was the best value. Padding for the seat is good and it is well made. Good value over brands such as Britax.
3,Kind of a hard seat,"I bought this seat b/c of all of the so-so cup holders and lack of armrests on the Britax Parkway. I have a very thin child and wanted something that she would be comfortable in. The seat is okay and definetly has more bells and whistles than say a graco high back (more sturdy, good strong height adjustment, shoulder adjustment strap to be used with just the base) my one complaint is that it is HARD HARD HARD. Also, we bought the sand color and is it more of a yucky light taupe that looks like it will get dirty in about 2 seconds. I think that we will revisit the Britax family."
4,Overall great booster seat,"Overall this is a great seat, much better than most of the other seats out there. I have one in my van and one in grandma's van. Very simple to take off the cover for cleaning and to put back on. My 4 year old daughter says she is very comfortable in it."
3,not as good as old formula,I had used this a few years ago and was simply amazed by it. Unfortunately it's not the same anymore. It's way too orange...and this is supposed to be the nude. Also way messier than it used to be. I nearly destroyed a hotel bathroom with this. The biggest reason I got this was b/c of how amazing it camouflaged cellulite and spider veins...it's just didn't do that anymore unless you seriously coat it....disappointing...it's just not the same.
4,Acoustic hooba,"The acoustic versions of Running Away, Up and Gone Away, and Crawling In THe Dark are by themselves worth the purchase. Ready For You Acoustic seemed a bit grainy sound, but still cool to have the acoustic version. Love the 3 other unreleased songs as well."
3,average Bumper,Looks nice. Holes did not line up and needed to grind 2 to get bolts to fit. No directions but maybe not needed. Would be nice if manufacturer sent liturature with other products available for this bumper like a bracket for a winch or other lights.
5,Versace Man is awesome!,"I enjoyed this product from the moment I received it. I recommend this cologne to anyone that enjoys a light but powerful scent. Let me clarify, it is not overwhelming, however it does catch everyone's attention. The fragrance last's for hours and is one of the best scents I have ever encountered. I Highly recommend this product."
2,OLD SCHOOL,"I thankfully only got a really, really small sample of this cologne. I was looking for something different for my boyfriend, so I thought I'd try it. Not impressed. Not only did it sting my nostrils when I took a big 'ol sloppy whiff, it reminded me of those old foreign men that wear way too much 'stinky' perfume. Kind of reminds me of a cross between Old Spice, or something like it, and ether. I didn't like it. I'm thinking I don't want to snuggle up to that smell on anyone. The bottle is semi-cute. It's just not a very original scent and it smells gross, I think you get the picture.If you like old dude perfume, then this is definitely for you!"
5,great product,"this should help to improve anyone's ability to play the violin, it had been some time since i had played my violin but this looks like it will help me to start back playing again."
3,Alaskan Sailor's Story,"This book is interesting for its glimpse of days gone by. I was personally disturbed by the role alcohol played in the author's story. However, he does have an interesting story to tell."
2,Disappointing,"I normally thoroughly enjoy reading travelogues. I was looking forward to this book for a week before I found time to read it. I didn't feel it was worth my time. I was looking for more information about and feel about the places, and less self-exploration of the authors. Not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,masters&jonhson,Todo el proceso de compra ha ido muy bien y el video estaba en perfectas condiciones
5,Beautiful message for us girls,Love this writer and love this little story about moving upward even if someone tells you that you can't. All little girls and boys should read it!
2,great idea but not developed,"I'm a fan of Diana Wynne Jones, but I was disappointed by this one. Hayley, the main character, joins her cousins in a game in the mythosphere. You can read about the plot in some of the other reviews. The mythosphere, a place where all the myths have some sort of physical reality, is a wonderful idea, and I hope Jones goes back to it. But in this book there's no character development and very little at risk, so the story just doesn't hook the reader. And though the book is intended for children, say 10-13, it assumes a familiarity with myth that American children, at least, will not have. There isn't even enough description--I wanted to know a lot more about the mythosphere, and about the objects the children gather there."
3,"The Game, by Diana Wynne Jones","Hayley, a young London girl raised in isolation by overly restrictive grandparents, is sent as punishment to stay with unknown relatives in Ireland. She finds herself amidst lots of joyous young children who invite her into their secret game-world of the ""mythosphere"". Because Hayley has never been allowed to play outdoors with other children before, she does not realize how unusual they are or how magical the mythosphere is.I am a fan of Diana Wynne Jones, so I expected to enjoy this. I did, but it is not her best book. It is shorter than her usual novels, and it is not set in one of her more popular series. Although she tries to justify it, Hayley is overly naive and innocent. Jones' fans will be slightly disappointed that The Game is not up to her excessively high standards, while readers unfamiliar with Jones' work should start with one of her better standalone novels like Dogsbody or one of her Chrestomanci novels like Charmed Life."
2,Surprisingly mediocre,"This author can almost always be relied upon for solid, if not brilliant, fantasy reads, but this one is a pale imitation of Percy Jackson and the Olympians (the Gods leaving mortal children with superpowers all over the earth who gradually learn to control their powers). It deservedly should go into the remainders bin."
5,Great story.,"I have come to expect excellence from Jones, and this work is no exception. It is tightly written, exciting, and fun. I think it might help a little if one had, as I did, a classical education, since the story assumes certain characters from ancient mythology, but it probably would still be enjoyed by teens of today just as well as other adults."
1,Long winded,"I usually like Diana's books, I really do, but the first three chapters and into the fourth were all introductory - and it's a short novel, so it should be even more succinct in introducing the story. I trudged through the first three chapters hoping it would get on with the story, but into the fourth I gave up. I'm sorry, but for me a book has to capture my attention within the first chapter and hold it by the end of that chapter. I only suffered through reading 3 chapters and part of the 4th because it was Diana Wynne Jones. Maybe it gets better in later chapters, but I've got better stories to read so I won't be the one to find out. For me, this story is BOOOORRRRING!"
5,A very well-written collection,"I bought this book on a whim because it looked interesting in the store. I'm glad I did as I've enjoyed it very much. The book is a collection of nineteen articles originally published in Esquire, GQ, or Rolling Stone. The subjects are generally sad and sordid but Sager takes the time to understand his subjects and explain not only what happened to them but why. Some of the incidents he describes are familiar but Sager's work has depth and reveals and explains things other more superficial coverage missed. I recommend this book and will be looking for future work by this writer."
3,Different,If you like techno/rap then you will like this nan 98's super remix.This is a fast pace album that gets you pumped up and making you want to dance.
3,The sum of the parts doesn't add up to the whole,"Michael Stipe's surprisingly incomplete photo essay of Patti on tour is a minor disappointment, akin to discovering an old photo album with the more important events -- the ones you'd really like to see -- obviously missing from the book. What's there is intriguing but doesn't reveal a lot, and the out-of-focus style Stipe uses isn't artful, just simply affected. Somewhere in Michael's garage, and Oliver Ray's basement, there are some great photos of Patti-the-shaman, as Mr. Burroughs describes her. I hope they don't get water-damaged in that cardboard box along with the discarded Polaroid camera."
5,um...yeah...,"A couple of things I've learned being an REM fan are that 1) things don't have to be logical to make sense and 2) that beauty is in the eye of ME, not the beholder sitting over there somewhere (of COURSE, everyone is their own ""me"" but that's just common sense). And I think this book is beautiful. If you love logic, or perfection for perfection's sake, don't bother, but if you want to look at something that's a bit different, see some images that it takes a mind like Michael Stipe's to think up, then I heartily reccomend it to you. The writings are fascinating as well. I almost felt like it gave me a bit of a peep hole into this group of people, to read some of their thoughts, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,Great paper,"I was looking for thick paper since I use duplex printing most of the time. The problem with thin paper is that when you use duplex printing you see the other side's printing as well, which is troublesome. But with this paper, the problem is ""almost"" gone. I can still see a vague shadow of the other side's printing, but it is acceptable for me and there are no readability issues.I like the feel of the paper, and I bought a second pack from Amazon.com.I use this paper with anEpson Artisan 810 Wireless Touchscreen Color Inkjet All-in-One Printer (C11CA52201)and it works perfectly with the printer."
5,Quality paper,"Good quality printer paper, decent price. Prints come out looking clean and vibrant, the kind of quality you'd expect from HP."
2,Non-coated paper gives disappointing results for ink jet printers,"Oops, with all the hype about this being ink-jet paper, I was disappointed to find it is just ""plain"" paper without the special coating which gives the best results on ink-jet printers. Graphics and especially photos are muddy without deep blacks. Nuts, but my fault for falling for HP's claim that this was Inkjet paper. No, it's just uncoated plain paper."
2,Nice paper - too slick,"This is nice paper - good weight, good brightness. Too bad it's so slick I have to babysit the printer to get it to finish even small print jobs."
3,Did She Really Bleach That Part of Her Anatomy???,"Any fan of hoaxes and anyone who actually checks into scams before falling for them will not find anything new here. The book was interesting in parts and very funny at times. Since the book was written in 2006 it is already dated as far as the information goes. It is hard to keep a tome like this truly up to date with unique information. A quick read/browse at best. You can find it at the library for free which is where I suggest you peruse it to your hearts content. Take a look, but you've been warned before you buy."
4,good stuff,"Great man, great music. This recording of pancho and lefty is the best i have ever heard."
4,Better than Elvis,Looks like it is going to be one of those boring number twiddling games but is in fact a lot of fun.You have to react much more than I expected to the situation in your casino and there is also a Feng Shui element where the layout of your casino floor has an effect on your customers.Well worth the budget price.
4,Entertaining and informative,"I loved this -- I not only Learned a lot about Leonardo but was entertained by it. I didn't feel the personal stuff was overdone, I like to know about the human side of genius."
5,9 volts Battery,Great deal for this battery. When is this deal going to come again? I recommend this product to anybody. this battery last forever.
5,Purchase of 9V Batterys,Excellent price on 9V Battery's. Product was as advertised and promptly shipped at no additional cost. No question that I will continue to make my battery purchases here.
3,Be careful of expiration and packaging,"I bought these batteries from Amazon and received them in a bubble mailer. The twelve pack of batteries had opened in transit and were scattered in the bubble mailer. Additionally, they have a late 2016 expiration date. I am used to expiration dates in the late teens to even the early twenties at this point. I don't know if 9 volts just don't last as long, but I would have been disappointed if my aim were to use these one or two at a time each year. Instead, I bought these for this year's replacement batteries for the whopping six smoke detectors in my house. I will have depleted them by 2013 so the 2016 date won't be that much of a problem for me. I tend to give batteries four stars, but I give this item three stars instead due to the packaging and date issues."
3,Color not as pictured,"As mentioned by another reviewer, the color of this item is not as pictured. The fixture I received is bright aluminum, not the dark bronze color pictured. It didn't matter that much for my application, but if you specifically want the dark color, don't buy this one."
2,Worked fine for a little while,"The security light failed in a short time. I replaced the light ""bulb"" just to make sure it was the bulb and not the light itself. So now I have to remove it and get another brand of security light."
1,"Right Item, wrong color sent","This was to be attached to a dark brick home, so as to have better lighting in the parking area. I purposely made sure that the fixture would be a dark brown to match the side of my house. But I was sent a bright aluminum fixture. Now I must look else where for the correct color. By the way the fixture I was sent does not match the color of the item on Amazon.com, which was what i wanted. Quality if poor, very ""thin"" material.Look some where else for your outdoor fixture."
2,Change job,"Half the stories are not funny and there is way too much complaining about the job. Mr. Hester is, though, a skillful writer and you can read thru the whole book to end up wondering why you did not throw it away sooner. Maybe Mr.Hester should quit flying and become a full time writer.Fit to read while waiting for your delayed flight."
2,extremely generic,hopelessly boring and pretty choppy. the whole book is a collection of gemeric stories which culdve potentialy been gathered from newspaer clippings. i was hopin for some really under the cover stuff. this book is a major letdown
4,plane insanity....,"An interesting read from a flight attendant's perspective of his 16 years on the job. Some parts will make you laugh out loud, but when I picked it up from the library the other day, having never seen the book before, I didn't expect it to be insanely funny (despite the praise on the back cover), but more a FA writing about his experiences. A look from the inside, if you will. And that's what I feel it delivered. It was interesting and well written with the right amount of humor."
2,More Malaise than Humor,"I'm a frequent flyer and thought this book would be comic relief for what is a stressful lifestyle. Instead, the book is like listening to a flight attendent gripe session (which happens all too often in real life) with the rare tidbit of wit or humor."
2,Kind of a Disappointment...,"I agree with some of the other reviewers...this was kind of mildly amusing, tame stuff that we've heard before. As a frequent flyer it confirmed what I had thought long ago...the general sentiment of flight attendants is that the traveling public are scum and that they are doing us a great favor. Also, after a while I was kind of annoyed by Mr. Hester's frequent sophmoric references to the opposite sex...it's like, I want to say to him ""Alright, already you're straight...I believe you!"""
1,A real disappointment,"As a 100,000 mile a year traveler, I was anxiously expecting this book to much more than it is. I had already read a lot of the stories in the media and in other books. I'm further very disappointed in the fact that flight attendants are viewed as the perfect customer service reps. Most of the airline incidents I have witnessed over 20 years have been between dissatisfied customers and rude airline employees."
2,plane insanity,"The author recounts numerous episodes that occurred during his flight attendant career. While many of these stories are entertaining they seem to be told in an ""I'm above this stuff/ chip on the shoulder way."" The book seems to lack the self deprecating and clever humor that would have improved the tales and added some sorely missing grace from the book. Mr. Hester doesn't seem like the type of flight attendant that I would have liked to have in the cabin with me on a long flight."
4,one of the funniest books i've read this year,"Some people lose their minds when they board a plane. In a series of essays Elliot Hester describes what it's like to : give service with a smile to a whole cabin full of drunks, go to the bathroom when turbulence hits, face down a huge passenger who you just put on the wrong plane and a host of other misadventures. This a great gift for anyone who's about to fly or for anyone who wonders why flying just isn't fun anymore. It's a good thing that Hester loves his work because there's no way a person could do this for nearly 20 years otherwise. I laughed so much while reading this that my family demanded that I read the stories out loud to them."
2,"Great idea, but. . .","The author writes what could be a fascinating book, but he seems to defend the airline industry at the expense of the passengers. His section on the 'Mile High Club' could have been much better. Granted, the force and appeal of sex is part of nature, but graphic descriptions aren't necessary.If he writes a regular column, I would be suspect as to the content of his column. No doubt that we humans are funnier than anybody, but the author didn't have to be so bitter about passengers. I have met some flight attendants who were very pleasant, and some who were rude, and most who were pleasantly distant. It's unfortunate that Reagan and the Congress chose to deregulate the airline industy, it has suffered since then.But the author backs away from that, concentrating on a mish-mash of disconnected stories."
4,Highly entertaining,"Flight attendant Elliot Hester's compilation of dozens of hilarious essays and stories about his experiences at 30,000 feet. Most of the essays in this book are things you may have read before -- a lot of them have been published on Salon.com and Hester is a syndicated travel columnist these days in addition to his day job in jets. But if you've never experienced his sharp wit and sharper tongue, you're in for a few belly laughs and groans. And also, you may never think about flight attendants in quite the same way ever again. Recommended to frequent fliers and anybody else who could use a few good laughs while squished into one of those tiny seats in coach!"
5,Wild,"Not for the squeamish or prudish, but probably the funniest book I've ever read and one of the scariest, since I sometimes fly."
5,Entertaining,"This is a great book to read, not only as a frequent passenger but also an airplane enthusiast. I have new opinion (and respect) to flight attendants."
2,ZzZzZzZzZz,I thought this book was terribly boring. I didn't even finish it. It did have some humerous parts and was well written but the stories were either too short with no details or too drawn out with details of passengers that were not funny or interesting.I expected to hear stories that would have my jaw drop but instead they were stories that I have heard standing in line at the aiport checkin - Nothing I haven't read in the papers and nothing very interesting.
1,Fairly boring reading,"Bought it as could not get the Air Babylon book, which was recommended. Started reading but got bored very fast. Bought Air Babilon and it is much more interesting and realistic"
4,Great stories,"Great stories, but they get a little repetitive. Fun stories and a great look into the back hallways of an airline. It is amazing anything gets done."
4,a fun read,"I enjoyed this fun read. It is a little dated, but most of what he talks about is timeless. I am in the business and while he may exaggerate at times, but for the most part is right on. Ideally you would read this on your vacation and give it to one of the flight attendants on the flight home."
2,"Interesting, but hard to learn from","This book has many interesting aspects of the German culture and language which makes it interesting enough to read. But I found it was very hard to really learn from it as the lessons are very short often with a single example. There are answer keys to the exercises, but none of the answers are explained so you find yourself guessing on the 'why.' The included CD has the dialogs from the chapters and they are interesting to listen to, but if you are a beginner at German (and if you aren't don't waste your time here) you will not be able to keep up with all the new vocabulary used. If I had to do it over, I would have purchased a book on German customs (to cover what this book did well) and stick with Michel Thomas' audio coursesGerman with Michel Thomas (Michel Thomas Series)and ""The Everything Learning German Book""The Everything Learning German Book: Speak, Write and Understand Basic German in No Time (Everything Series)."
1,Going elsewhere for part,"I have a DLC-1SS that I need a replacement lid for, but the listing states 'it doesn't fit models made in China', which the 1SS is. Another person referenced the model 1SS, but didn't say whether or not this was the appropriate part and did in fact work with the Chinese made chopper. I agree with the other reviewer...how about providing enough information so customers can order what they need??? Very annoying, so one star for the poor listing. I don't know if the part is any good, since I can't be sure what to order!"
5,Replacement,So I broke my original work bowl and needed to replaced it. It fits a little tight around the locked parts and the top one does not go in all the way the old one did. But we shall see how it goes.
1,No Part Number? Really?,"I dropped the lid for my old Cuisinart Mini Prep, and the tab broke off, so I need a replacement. This kind of looks like the one I need, but who knows? There is ABSOLUTELY NO PRODUCT INFORMATION GIVEN!!!! Since I don't want to take a chance that this isn't the correct part, I'll shop somewhere else. Disappointing."
3,came highly recommended...,"I only gave 3 stars because I just started using this product for my cat for preventative reasons, so it is too soon to tell how effective this product is, yet. Many, many people highly recommended this product to me, however, and THEY would have rated it 4 or even 5 stars.I realized that it was easily administrated by placing the drops in olive oil. My cat loves olive oil and licked up the Tinkle Tonic very readily in this manner. I believe a little tiny dose of olive oil is good for cats, though caloric; it is good for their coat and skin and digestive tract, in small doses. Some people have suggested salmon or fish oil.If I had to administer orally-well, don't even go there......"
3,Not as good as DeJong's other work,"I am a fan of DeJongs's and feel like his work has dramatically influenced my life. His first tape, The Silva Method, was better and had cleaner, more usable exercises.This work is more talky, the exercises are somewhat difficult to use, and I would recommend this work only after you have experienced his other, which has exercises so powerful you feel mentally and physically refreshed, stronger, different through practicing them.In fairness, you've got to be committed to a daily routine of practise, and if you aren't willing to do this, you really won't immediately benefit from any Silva program."
2,Not a fan,"This book gets two stars because my kids really do like it, but it makes me cringe when my kids pick it out to read. It seems to have one or two extra, unnecessary adjectives in every sentence. There are many other high quality books out there to enjoy, so I'd avoid this one if you can."
3,"Just OK, but my daughter loves it","I was not very impressed by this book when my daughter brought it home from the library, but she LOVES it. I got her a copy of her own, and she still brings home the library copy from time to time.The story is very cute, but shallow. I don't think the story really teaches anything important (although not all stories have to), and it isn't particularly clever--just cutesy. Which, I suppose, is what many three-year-old girls are looking for. Parents, however, would probably be interested in other books."
2,"Charming pictures, disappointing story","This book looks really cute, especially the inside cover illustration of Little Red's ""world"". Unfortunately, once you get past the really charming illustrations, you find a story that is about as engaging as those mass-produced ""character"" oriented books where the author is basically ""Disney"". For a book of 40 pages with this many illustrations, remarakably little actually happens, and you could sum it up in once sentence: While on a picnic Red and friends hear a loud noise, investigate, discover creaures in need of assistance, render aid, and everyone shares the picnic. That's it. Really. Don't waste your time."
1,this book is terrible,i would rather be stabbed in the eye with a rusty fish hook than have to read this terrible book to my children ever again. the writing is awful and the illustrations are only slightly better
1,Garbage,This is just the worst of the worst. Stilted language and a saccharine (or should I say treacly?) sweet story. Little catch phrases that are supposed to be cute abound. Yuck.Of course my 2 year old loves it.
2,Well...the pictures are cute...,"Currently, it seems all sort of celebrities think they can write a children's book, especially if a great illustrator is brought in to ""pump up"" the content. This story is very weak, although the pictures are cute. Story line: Little Red reaches out to a lilly pad to rescue a bunny. The book was given to my daughter; I would never have wasted my money on this.(And why on earth is Sarah Ferguson still banking on her Duchess title-it's been how many years since she was divorced from her Prince??) Oh sorry, different rant."
1,"WARNING - Good cd BUT its a reissue, NOT new material!","WARNING - This is a good cd but, even though it says it was released in 2003, it is made up of tracks from the band's 1990 releases on the House of Blues label. About half are live tracks and half are studio recordings, so there is no real continuity on the CD.Also, please be aware that the version of 'Amazing Grace' on this CD is NOT the one set to the tune of 'House of the Rising Sun' that first appeared on the 2001 Grammy-winning album ""Spirit of the Century,"" and that the band is famous for performing since.There is nothing wrong with reissue CDs but they should be clearly marked as such, and this one is not."
1,Blind Boys Amazing Grace,I just listened to this CD for the first time and was disappointed. This is not an in studio CD. It is amix of live performance and studio. The reason I purchased the CD was for the Amazing Grace track. The song is a six minute disappointment.
5,A very interesting and erudite book!,This fine book is of interest to adults as well as to children. Each page is headed by a famous quote and on the remainder of the page Lisa explains its meaning. This is a wonderful book for parents to buy to read to their children before bedtime. I am happy to very highly recommend this book!
5,Very Cool Niche Quote Book!,"This one caught me by surprise, and I loved it! There are very few kid-focused quotation books, but they are a great way to teach kids valuable lessons about life. It is very well-organized by different categories. I loved the illustrations in this book, and was blown away by the concept. I might have to follow their lead and release a similar book.Enjoy!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" book sereies and the brand new ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
1,Easy CD Creator 6 is Anything But -- Stay Away!,"This 6th version of Easy CD Creator is worthless, plain and simple. I could not get it to run on a brand new Dell Pentium machine no matter how clean the install was, or how many times I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Roxio technical support was useless. I cannot comprehend know how this software made it through beta testing, much less to the street. After 5 useful versions of Easy CD Creator, it's hard to fathom how Roxio went so wrong, but their reputation will be taking a large hit as a result of this disaster."
1,A lousy product,I have had this for a year. I have tried to create JPG format cd's using it's DVD burner and it's data storage mode. Neither works. When I move clips around it seems to randomly juggle the pictures. The instruction manual is not useful and overly simplistic. It's support is non-existant. I am scrapping this junk and will try Adobe Album
3,Beware the updates,"I've had better luck than the other reviewers, however I agree it acts like a beta version. After installing the program I was prompted to ""update"" the program suite. The update was over 39 mb! After loading a subsequent ""update"", I was prompted to restart my computer 4 times! Each time the computer would come up, I'd be prompted to restart again for the for the Roxio update to take effect.Overall, the program is much easier to use than the prior version, in my opinion. I am especially pleased with the buffer underrun protection which was an issue with the 2 prior versions."
1,Buy anything else--not this,"If the software worked, it would be quite good! It is relatively easy to figure out what to do, and then what to do next.Unfortuantely, this is a bug laden mess provided by a company which clearly has no concept of customer service. Roxio has no compunction in providing non-working software. While it is possible to produce a working DVD after MANY hours getting the program set-up, woe to the person who then tries to use a different camera, OS or computer.Current example, Roxio recently updated their engine to ver. 6.2.xx. Attempts to update my registered version resulted in error messages. Attempts to get customer service were unsuccessful. The software should not even be given away free."
1,Just Don't Buy This.,"This product has singlehandedly destroyed both systems in my home. We have multiple hard drives, and Roxio seemed to think that it could create another partition and change our drive lettering without any warning to us at all. Nothing we can do seems to repair this, and looking for more information on this product issue reveals two things - we are not alone, and there's nothing we can do but restore our systems from backup. Do yourself a favor, skip over Roxio and find something that isn't bent on destruction."
1,Worst Software Ever,"This software completely sucks. On top of bad registration management, incomprehensible updating and pop ups to get more of your money for upgrades, etc. the software will completely hammer ITunes by altering your registry and make it impossible to burn cds from ITunes. Then you get the joy of reinstalling ITunes, and done hurridly, you've just lost all your playlists, album art, etc. Purchase this software if you want hours of head-banging frustration and annoyance."
1,Lots of Problems,"I would not recommend this product. I have had many strange errors - the latest being I can no longer drag and drop to burn a CD - I get an error indicating ""End License User Agreement"" not agreed to. The Roxio website says this can be fixed by installing EULasp to update to latest service pack - it does not help."
1,easy cd & dvd creator 6,"i ordered this cd, because after bringing my desktop computer in for service and when i started to use it, on the screen each time came upto insert the cd/dvd creator 6 and each time i tried to cancell, it immed.reappeared. and i tried to delete it to no avail/i then ordered the cd andfigured that by inst. the cd. that my problems would go away/ but aftrer inst. the cd/now i get install eccd dvd creator 6 if you press. cancell itcomes right back as installing and you just can not get rid of it/this is$18.00 of waisted money/if you go on the intern. to easy creator also no good advice/this thing is like a virus not going away!!!!!!to rate it the minimum is one star,it is not worth any stars!!!!"
3,Good stuff,"I've never had a can of this stuff clog on me. Some of the cheaper stuff, even when you turn them upside down and spray clean the nozzle, still clog. This also sprays nice and even."
5,Quality Sheets,"I'm so glad I decided to purchase these sheets. Reading others opinions helped sway my decision.Not only are they soft and silky to the touch,(woven from single-ply yarn) but are of good quality and well-constructed. I really like the fact that the elastic goes completely around the fitted sheet, and not just on the corners.I washed and dryed them before putting them on the bed. Cotton, out of the dryer, with no ironing! How great is that?I'd recommend these to anyone wanting quality sheets...don't be misled by the price.Would also like to commend Amazon for the fast shipping on these."
4,Fantastic Sheets for the Price,"This set of sheets is an excellent value, but I must admit that the sheets are not the softest I have touched. They will most likely become softer, however, with wash and wear. They look beautiful on the bed. The deep fitted sheet fits my pillowtop mattress perfectly. The stitching details on the flat sheet is very plain and basic. It is simply a double stitch with no embellishment. This may be trivial to some, but even the least expensive sheets have a satin decoration on the flat sheet. I bought the rust set, and it is a very nice, rich color. The best part of the set is no wrinkles!"
4,"Lovely fabric, disappointing workmanship","I agree with the other reviewers who have commented on the fine quality of the fabric in these sheets. They're smooth, silky, strong, wrinkle-free, and very comfortable. However, the quality of the stitching and general workmanship is a bit under par, and not nearly as nice as the Pinzon 400-count hemstitch sheets, which I purchased at the same time.For example, the elastic on most high-end sheets (and on the Pinzon 400-count hemstitch sheets)is placed in a channel; on the Pinzon 500-count Wrinkle Guard sheets, however, the elastic is stitched directly to the fabric. While this may seem like a small point, it is an important one insofar as stitching through the elastic tends to weaken it and shorten its useful life. Hems and seams on these sheets are also rather crudely finished when compared with typical high-end sheets."
1,Oversize,This set doesn't even come close to fitting a King size bed. We tuck in the excess. It misses fitting by at least 4 inches of fabric.
2,Poor fit,This the 1st time I have not been pleased w/Amazon. The problem the sheets were washed before trying to use. Never have had to prefit sheets. Guess I should have. Can't return now. Oh Well LIVE and LEARN!!!
4,"Pinzon 500-Thread-Count Wrinkle Guard King Sheet Set, Ivory",I bought the Pinzon 500-thread count wrinkle guard king sheet set in ivory to give to my daughter for her birthday later this year. I really hope she likes this set! J. Hall
5,.GREAT CRISP SHEETS,I waited to review these sheets until after I had washed them a few times - THEY ARE WONDERFUL and I plan on buying a set for every bed in my house.They are soft enough not to be obnoxious and remain crisp even after sleeping on them for a week. Great product!
5,great sheets,"Confession...I am A maniac about having ironed sheets. These need only a quick touch up as they sat in the drier for hours. If I had removed them immediatly, they probably would have need nothing. Definitely would buy again."
5,Very comfortable sheets,"What a great value. These sheets are in a beautiful rich color with a nice sheen. The sheets are smooth, crisp, thick, and very comfortable. The pockets are very deep and fit my mattress well. They really do resist wrinkles and stay have remained high quality after several washings. My last set of 500 thread-count sateen sheets pilled after a month, so I waited till I had these sheets for a month or so before writing this review. I am very satisfied with the quality. The comfort in incredible. These sheets are now my favorite ones and I recommend them to any one."
5,super comfortable,"Not going to get word oriented, just want to say that these sheets are probably the most comfortable that I have ever slept on. Although they are 500 count, they are not slick like a lot of high count sheets are."
2,"scratch, scratch, scratch","These sheets are scratchy. So, while they fit my bed nicely, stay wrinkle free and are a beautiful color, I cannot recommend them because they are far from soft. Scratch. Scratch. Scratch."
5,Fit for a King!,"These sheets are the best that I have ever purchased. I ususally don't worry about thread count or designer labels, but these are great! I could not believe the quality that I have received. If I could convince my husband to buy all of the colors I would. These are a must have for the price!!!"
4,Better than I thought it would be...,I bought these after reading other multiple reviews hoping they would be as good as they sounded...THEY ARE! I have already ordered another set...they are so soft and wonderful to sleep on. No shrinkage and as wrinkle free as you can get fresh out of the dryer. Would highly recommend.
5,Comfort/Quality,"I am ordering another set, different color.Excellent from shipping, washing, sleeping like a dream"
5,Wonderful sheet set!!!,"I'm delighted with these sheets. The fabric feels smooth and sturdy, they wash beautifully with few wrinkles, and the extra-deep pockets fit my tall pillow-top mattress with fabric to spare. Excellent quality for an excellent price. Highly recommended!"
1,did not fit 70 dart 340 swinger,"way too small for the factory disc brakes on a 70 dart 340 swinger.However the factory drum front brakes may have a smaller front hub and that could have been the issue for me,but it is not clear."
2,Not the original version!!,"Since nobody has mentioned it, this is the latter version which sounds like a cover. The original is much better."
5,"Opinion may be a little biased, but","I think this is a beautifully designed and well written book. The artists featured are all very talented and have some very good things to say about the processes illustrators and digital designers go through to arrive at various solutions. I was one of the artists asked to contribute and I have to say that I am extremely honored to have been a part of this book. Great job, Yolanda!"
4,excellent state of illustration book,"This is, I think, the second book in a series that seems to be looking to cover digital design. The first one was about graphics and this one continues in the same excellent style. Basically take some of the acknowledged greats of contemporary illutration and find out what they think about when they're working on a project. Insightful and with great pictures."
3,Excellent Reference,This book was 75 cents. I needed it for work. Now it looks good on my bookshelf when some of the older scientists come by my desk
3,Karens Review,"It was very educational and helpful in my studies at the Institute of Business and Medical Careers in Fort Collins CO. I am studying to be an accountant there and it was a good way to break the ice when going into my accounting class, so I thought it was a good movie set."
1,Principles of Geology Affordable & High Quality Paperback Edition,"Affordable is one thing...unreadable is another. Amazon you should get this unreadable OCR copy of a Harvard College original off your ""shelves"". More than half the pages are so poorly copied you can't read them. This work is too important in the history of Geology to tolerate such shoddy publishing. Shame on you Filiquarian Publishing, LLC!Principles of Geology or, The Modern Changes of the Earth and its Inhabitants Considered as Illustrative of Geology"
3,Pretty good,"Not as good as Goldman's first novel but if you're looking for an enjoyable piece of literary fiction, you could do worse."
3,Well-written but over-use of Spanish detracts from novel,This book was very well written and an enjoyable read. I enjoyed the well-developed relationships between the characters in the book. Unfortunately I felt the constant use of Spanish with no translation frustrating and felt it made the book seem choppy. A lot of the Spanish used is not in common use in most of America (excluding large cities) and could have benefitted from a translation key somewhere. Otherwise I enjoyed being able to look into a world unlike the one I live in and experience the freshness of the characters.
1,Needs a writer not a journalist,"I love all books Latin-American and Latino and was anxious to read this. What I found was a rambling, dull story without much purpose. The prose was flat and uninspired. I read Goldman's other book--which was way too long, by about 10x--but it had a good story in it. This one has about 35 pages of good writing (could have been a good short story). The rest--well, I read the paper, and it was as competent as many newspaper articles, a lot longer, the same ability with words. They don't pretend to be writers of fiction. Some of the characters--yawn!"
1,Not What You'd Expect,"You would think this book was full of great pictures and information on the history of such magazines. Sorry, but there is a short paragraph about each book and its publisher, but it's far from complete. A lot of magazines I know of aren't even listed, and those that are listed (alphabetically) mysteriously stop in the T's, as if they just ran out of space or someone got bored. (I know I did!) The only pictures in the book are poor-quality b&w reproductions of the covers. You can get better-looking ones off of EBay. This book was a waste of my time, and would be of yours, too."
1,wrong part,"I ordered a bug shield for my dodge caravan, they sent me one for a jeep. it cost me $12 dollers to ship it back. so now I dont have anything except the charge for $25 plus the $12 return shipping fee I paid , never again..."
3,Love the color,I really like this watch because of the color. It matches all of my Turquoise Jewelry. The only problem I have is that I wish it was water proof. All the moisture gets in the watch.
4,Entralling experience,"I love this book. The main character, Pavek, is a memorable fellow right down to his snarly lip. The problems he faces are both interesting and entertaining. The book has that street sense theme to it as it smoothly leads you from the surface of the city into the frightening secrets of the underground world. Another bonus to this book is it doesn't have those grey areas that seem to take longer to read because of lack of interest. I think ... why not take a journey to Lynn's city of Urik. You won't regret it!"
3,Cryptozoology,"I have read much better books/ presentations of the facts or sightings on the "" monsters"" of crypto, and the ""mysteries"" of atlantis etc.Most of the topics were presented in boring, unethusiastic coverage. It also read as tho it was a rehash of other writers' material, to me.It's an okay book, if you want an addition to your cryptozoology library."
2,"A Real Misnomer, Very Misleading","The other reviewers here are not kidding. ""Blades of Lightning"" - what a misnomer! I watched this whole thing and it's a wonder I didn't fall asleep.The only hockey you see are practice sessions for the Buffalo Sabres. The only fans you see are some standing in line for the Anaheim Ducks when they were in the Stanley Cup final. Other than that, it's just interviews with a handful of people.I thought it might be okay afer viewing the fist couple of minutes as Stan Fischler gave us some history of hockey. Hey, I can always learn something. But, basically after that the subject matter boiled down to discussing two lockouts and listening to Los Angeles King owner Bruce McNall talk about acquiring Wayne Gretzky or talk about his rock collection hobby. Yawn!The only interesting part was Fischler talking about ""Rocket"" Richard and the riots they had in Montreal one season.I'm being generous giving this two stars. It's only because I like sports history."
3,Like totally rad!,"Okay so um... I collect 80s music. I live 80s music. I have rare club gems and radio hits that haven't been heard since there debut. And these songs are solid gold worthy of American Bandstand for sure. The problem with collections though is they always lack something and for a dance CD not to have Madonna or Prince is a big huh? Not mention the rulers of the 80s club scene Erasure, ABC, or The Pet Shop Boys. However, it has some hard to find gems for the 80s geek who wants to deeper into the 80s scene as opposed to just playing Rock It, Like A Virgin, and Billy Jean all the time. So for the novice 80s nerd this is a good start but I urge you to go much much deeper."
2,I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A LOT BETTER,"I couldn't wait to get the book. Tobias is my favorite character. I LOVE Animorphs and couldn't beleive it was as bad as it was. Also for all of you who heard the rumor Tobias and Rachel Kiss, well I'd been waiting for it throughout the animorphs, and I guess I'll be waiting a lot longer :( Well I'm glad he did learn about his dad. I just want to see Ax's reaction, I also wanted to see Rachel's reaction when she found out Tobias can morph his old form for book #13 but (sigh) That'll probaly never happen."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For those who don't think this is cool, you are sad, pitiful beings. This is what Animorphs should be. Rachel and Tobias make a cool couple because it's not entirely obvious (unlike other characters...). Anything lost in lack of action is made up for in plot. READ IT!!!"
4,This book was darn good!,"I liked this book, especially the part when Tobias finds outabout Elfangor! I read it in like a week and most of the time it takesme two or three weeks to read an Animorphs book because I'm too lazy to read it but this had a lot of cool parts!!"
5,The best Tobias book ever!!!!,"I'm normaly not a big fan of Tobias books, but this is the exception, I recomened it to everyone. Tobias only lives because Visser 3 slips up big time. I was very suprised to find out who Tobias's dad is, and why he was on Earth, I would never have expected an Andalite Prince to run away and hid on Earth. But it dose, in my opinion at least, explain the way Tobias acts when he meets Elfangor, In ""The Invasion"""
3,Well Umm look below,"I don't like Tobias that much, but the fact that he will find out about his father is pretty cool. All I can say is Rachel and Tobias is not a very cute couple, Jake and Cassie, way better, they are at least interesting and I think deeper. KILL Tobias I say"
5,WARNING: FOR ANIMORPH FREAKS ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a definite cant-put-down-animorph! Tobias and Rachel may not be the cutest couple around, in true form of course but when Toby's a human oh man! if you decide to read this book, though, and expect Tobias and Rachel to KISS you may end up dissipointed. i wont say anymore."
5,Best of the rest !!!,"This was my favorite book fram all the rest!The only bad thing about it is that Tobias didn't tell anyone that Ax is his uncle!Also, if I were Tobias I would stay in human morph,then use the blue box to become an Animorph once more!Then I wouldn't lose Rachel or being an Animorph ! Otherwise, this book is da bomb! I couldn't put it down for an instant!Read it and you will love,too!!"
5,My third favourite book,"I'd really love to have this book. Just to let everyone know, Tobias will not morph a Yeerk. He morphs a rabbit. Check the offical site. A stranger is looking for Tobias. She claims to be his long lost cousin. Is she telling him the truth? Or is she worse than a liar?"
3,mom of a thomas lover,"My son was thrilled to get this toy, but lost interest in it quickly. The inner turntable comes off and gets misplaced at times. I was disappointed that he lost interest in it as he LOVES the train sets."
3,Disappointed,I was disappointed to open the package and find that the Reed and Barton Country French place setting was made in China! I returned it for a refund. It is a beautiful pattern--wish I had bought more years ago when products were made in America.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed to find out that this place setting was not exactly the same as my original setting...the product said made in china, and lead content was less than my setting. Even though the setting name and brand name is the same the quality is NOT! My original setting was made in japan."
5,"Great concert, great sound.","This may not appeal 100% to ""old school P-Funk fans"". Maybe the ""raw"" part is missing. But it is a very appealing concert, as most Montreux are. Great sound, P-Funk spirit is alive. Great performances, a great mixture of funk, rock, jazz, hip-hop, soul, you name it.George Clinton's presence gives a special experience and energy to the show.I miss Bootsy Collins on this one but you won't be dissapointed. The repertoire is very good and there's a good variety of people and styles. A superb violinist (Lili Haydn) gives a brilliant solo, as well as Bernie Worrell's keyboard solo.A memorable version of Maggot Brain with violinist Lili Haydn and Michael Hampton on guitar is also available.Over 2 hours with Funkadelic/Parliament stuff, with a good picture and great 5.1 sound. Highly recommendable. Now I will try to get the older concert from Mr. Clinton."
2,Not the right concert at the right moment (where is the public ?),"This DVD is cool cause it is the only one since 70's DVD concert....(good quality audio and video)However this concert is not representative of a real P Funk sound and atmosphere you can feel in gorgeous concerts (for exemple....2005 shows !!)Most of songs are too soft : big lack of loudness and absence of Funkadelic singers ---->""Cosmic slop"" is not on this DVD ggrrrrrr.....Content of the DVD is really poor and bonus are illusion ....THey put intro of Bennie worrel and maggot brain as bonus....it's a part of the whole show !!!! lol Don't fake THE FUNK please ....just pray for a new DVD with a good production this time and the complete 2005 P Funk band on it !!!Thank you and get off your ass for the next video !"
4,George Clinton & Parliament Funkadelic - Live at Montreux 2004,"A very entertaining concert video exemplifying the later stages of the collection of characters known as Parliament Funkadelic - new members, but still amazing music and visual performances"
5,I miss my gray matter,"I can't go to my right (or left for that matter), 400 meters is my distance event to the car, and I resent that Coca Cola no longer makes free glasses. But George Clinton is still PFunk. If you want to get a visual sense of what the Parliament/Funkadelic experience was all about then buy theThe Mothership Connection Live From Houstonand leave The supreme funkster and this DVD alone. If ""Free your mind"" is still your mantra, if you know why the Temptations tried to go Psychedelic, and still don't understand why Oxford dictionary credits antidisestablishmentarianism as the longest word in the English language, then you are in the right place.Maybe the passage of time has transformed the ""P"" to passive, but it will never mean passé."
1,Sloppy and Uninspiring,"Presentation poor, band looked rough, playing sloppy apart from occasional solos by horn section, weak grooves. PAST SELL BY DATE I'm afraid. Expected full on funk... NOT.I bought Chic Live at Montreaux along with this DVD, 5 STAR FUNK! how it should be!Sold this turkey on Ebay the next day. P Funk? POOR FUNK"
2,It wasn't one of P-Funk's best live performances,"I have seen them live and they got busy, but this DVD doesn't compare to what I have seen. George Clinton is really high in this concert and it is affecting his performance. Plus, One Nation Under A Groove(One of my personal favs) wasn't on this. No offense to George, but I was not interested in seeing his granddaughter rap. She was good, but I wanted to see funk, not rap. P-Funk should have put a better DVD out."
5,I'm going to order copies of this 4 every1 I know.,"It's about time that we P-Funkheads, maggots & Funk-ah-tearsget a real dvd from Georgie & the p-funkmob.This is the BOMB yo...~!"
3,An OK Model,"This obviously is a re-release of the OLD ""Empire Strikes Back"" kit released in the 80's.A decent size kit (approx 15 inches) it gives an experience modeler a good opportunity at super detailing.The kit is relatively easy to build out of the box, but it has many inaccuracies most notably the inaccurate sensor/bridge deflector DOME on top of the ship.These inaccuracies can be addressed by looking in the Internet for replacement parts and articles on addressing those inaccuracies.However, the kit is worth the price.My only disappointment is the kit is not in scale with the new ""Republic Star Destroyer"" from ""Revenge of the Sith"". The new kit for the new movie is over 19 inches long. In order for this kit to be in scale with the current movie version, it would need to be about 24 inches long.Hopefully someone will make the ""Imperial Star Destroyer"" to that scale."
1,cross control is too far,"the cross control is too far away from the left hand can reach, my thumb is hard to reach it"
2,Too small,"Love the design, but after purchasing the change pad cover, I won't purchase another product from this line. It was a tight fit from the start. Once I washed it, the fabric shrunk and is nearly impossible to cover the changing pad. Two stars for design, but it's clear that you're paying for style, not durability."
5,Beautifully crafted and durable fun for the entire family,"I was amazed at the beautiful craftsmanship and attention to detail of every aspect of this railroad set. What a delight, after seeing so many poorly made toys, to present my grandson with this true work of art. This set in particular has many mechanical aspects -- hoisting cranes, loading logs at the Sodor lumbermill, loading barrels of flour and molasses, filling water tanks, etc -- all of which work with delightful realism. I look forward to enjoying this set with my grandson for many many years, as he learns not only basic principles of physics, but the essential elements of sustainable community life, as well."
5,Great buy. My daughter loves it.,"This is a very large set so see that it fits nicely in the room. However, it is great."
2,Very hit-and-miss,"Okay, first the problems with the book. Agee starts by trying to predict the Rapture, which is a huge no-no for any prophecy scholar. Then she spends a whole chapter trying to prove that Saturn is Heaven--and while she makes an almost frighteningnly good case, in several instances she twists Scripture out of context to do so.So why did I give it two stars instead of one? Well, for all of its faults, this book did have one huge benefit for me: It got me to study prophecy in-depth. Agee actually makes a few good points that many prophecy scholars have missed (such as the correct timing of the seals and trumpet judgements and the diffrence between the Tribulation and the Day of the Lord), and she also makes some wild predictions that you'll have to spend some time analyzing to debunk."
1,¿Another Date Setter?,"The book follows the usual pre-milennial, pre-tribulationist pattern. The only creative aspect of it is the framing in some sort of theatrical cast composed of several scenes. The author came into disrepute due to her failed predictions of Christ's coming in 1998. I would not recommend it."
1,Viewsonic A70f,"Most reviews I see read seem like they are written by some professional marketing agent trying to persuade me that they are an average ""Joe"" writing to extol the virtues of some product. Let me assure you, I am no professional....and I certainly cannot extol the virtues of this monitor. Right out of the box, this monitor had problems. Extreme bowing at both the top and bottom of the picture were more than I could stand. I fiddled with the controls for over an hour trying to eliminate the bowing, but to no avail. On top of that, the CD-ROM included with the monitor caused my PIII HP all kinds of problems. I finally removed the CD software and let the plug & play routine do its thing. That procedure stopped the freezing and quirky mouse problems, but the bowing remains. This one is going back....tomorrow!!!"
3,One year warranty is the deal killer,"I bought one. It worked for one year and three months. ViewSonic said too bad when I complained. I had always bought Samsungs and they all are still working. The big mystery is that the warranty is one year in the United States, but it's three years outside the US. What's the reason for that?"
1,Cheap Junk!,"Right out of the box this unit screamed cheap. The base, compared to my old A70f monitor, was flimsy and unsteady. The rear section of its swivel base was separate and to be inserted by the user; unfortunately, it was too thin and cheesy to stay in the slot and therefore useless. Fortunately I still had the old, well-made one. That's probably why the base came unassembled -- it was impossible to assemble.But the monitor is going back anyway, because it also has poor linearity and is impossible to adjust satisfactorily. I apparently got the last one, too, as it arrived yesterday (12/22/04) and is already shown as discontinued today. Thankfully, Amazon has a customer-friendly return policy."
3,There's MORE....,"Good overall view of some of the problems in education today, but for the foremost and unquestionably the full story of what has happened to education, get Charlotte Iserbyt's book, THE DELIBERATE DUMBING DOWN OF AMERICA. It is also available on Amazon."
4,Richly illustrated,"A parable of an 800 year-old tree, sparingly but pointedly told in words, and richly illustrated. The tree, which has witnessed much over its long lifetime, is threatened by bulldozers. Its story and rescue advocate for ecological activism.Suitable, as the publisher suggests, for ages 4-adult."
2,"Great illustrations, mediocre writing","This book has a great message for readers and contains impressive, moving illustrations. My only negative criticism is that the writing itself lacks good rhythm and thus seems forced. I feel like such beautiful illustrations deserved a poem with a greater grasp of meter and word choice."
2,Less than subtle,"I bought this book for our three-year-old daughter, but can't stomach reading it to her, even though our family loves nature and very much believes in protecting the environment. The illustrations are great, and I like the idea of telling the story from the tree's point of view. Unfortunately, the text gets a bit preachy and ends up lacking subtlety. I was really hoping for something more profound, given the excellent premise of the story. As for the cd that comes with, my daughter said, ""I don't like this, turn it off."" My husband said the same thing. Oh well, at least a good cause is being supported."
1,thid book advocates cutting down trees :(,"I am so sad I purchased this book, I don't even fell good about giving it to the goodwill. this books plot says that the trees were happy to be cut down and used to make a boat and a crucifix and a bed for Jesus. Even Jesus would be sad. Why teach children that trees are happy to be cut down?"
5,Outstanding publication!,"The Tree absolutely captivates the reader, whether he/she be an adult or youth. I have been using it in classrooms, and the kids find it fascinating to pour over the illustrations while at the same time absoribing the message. This is definitely a perfect tool for anyone interested in environmental education but is also great entertainment. I will definitely pass this book on to my children, grandchildren and so on."
4,Good quality,The biggest minus is that this songbook DOES NOT contain Shot in the Dark song. The rest of the book is of good quality.
3,nice table,"The table itself is nice, smaller than I thought. Nightmare getting the lampshade assembled. Directions did not help, went out and bought a lampshade but thankfully can return it now that we finally figured it out."
2,Not Satisfied with this Product,I've had this table lamp for two years; it is very unstable. The wooden dowels that hold the magazine rack together keep falling out if you bump into the table. The lamp shade had threads hanging down from it since I purchased it. The swinging arm of the lamp is a nice feature. I got this lamp for half price; it isn't worth it even for half price.
5,Sawzall blades,"Good blades, pretty long life as long as you use your saws toe correctly and maximize the use of the whole blade."
1,i dont like,escribo en español ya q soy de venezuela esta carpa la verdda me dio problemas bajo la lluvia y la varilla q va en la entrada d la carpa para hacer una especie de vicera para q no entre agua el primer dia apenas colocandola se rompio quiero saber quien me responde por esto pero en la pagina no veo ningun lugar donde pueda acudir a mi queja y quien me compensa por esto y quien me enviara a venezuela el remplazo de dicha pieza estoy muy inconforme y molesto por esta situacion
4,Great Tent!,"We've had this tent out a couple of times and the set up is simple, the tent is very sturdy although I would recommend getting some metal stakes to spike the tent down with. The plastic ones are really only good if you're on a manicured camp ground. We slept two adults and one teen comfortably. Any more than four people might get a little cramped though."
4,Almost a perfect set,Great spoons and seem solidly constructed. They appear to measure accurately enough but I really wish that they had included a 1/2 tablespoon in the set. So much of my bread baking requires it that I'm always having to reach for an old spoon from another set.
2,Not What I Expected...,"Sadly these are not what I expected. Yes, I expected measuring spoons and that is what I received, however it the various amount of measurement that bother me. I ordered these with the expectation that I would be receiving several usable measuring spoons. Although they are usable the amounts of three are not. The first three are smidgen, pinch, and dash, all of which are irrelevant (cute but irrelevant). I will be returning them but I did not want someone else to have the same experience."
3,These are certainly sturdy,But the measurement on each handle is very hard to read. You may need a magnifier to see which spoon is which.
4,Norpro measuring spoons,"I am not a professional Chef, but I like to cook, when I purchased this set of measuring spoons from Amazon, I had no idea the set would include measurements for the ever confusing: dash, pinch and smidgen. I am so glad I purchased this set, its not only practical, but inexpensive as well. They are made of heavy duty stainless steel rated at 18/10, most of the similar sets did not even offer up their ratings in their product descriptions. This 18/10 rating refers to the amount of stainless steel that was used in the manufacturing process of the product. The thicker the better, because it will last longer and it will maintain its integrity for the life of the product. I would recommend this product to my friends."
4,Ring clip rusts,The spoons work great to reach into spice jars - even the tablespoon. Nice 18/10 stainless. The ring clip rusts immediately after putting in the dishwasher. I recommend removing after purchase as rust stains were transferred to the spoons. The spoons are not a smooth chrome finish like you may be used to with 18/10 silverware. They have more of a brushed finish.
5,"""Rigorous and Practical""","This is a rigorous and practical book in which the author takes you on a methodical, purposive journey, but it is not a highly technical accounting textbook. Each new area is introduced by applying the basics learned at the start. All fundamental areas of accounting are covered, but each is not overbroad. The learning process is facilitated by constantly applying the fundamentals of accounting to real examples. This application tests what you have already learned.By: - Francis G. Gillis"
5,Very good book for engineers,"One of the simplest tasks a piping or equipment engineer could ever do - specify a seal, specify a gaskets. As any engineer who has specified with any regularity has learned (the hard way) - one of the most misunderstood tasks. More (gasket) is not (always) better (in fact less usually is). I recommend this book for anyone working in the field."
3,the video about timothy,was ok but a bit biased in the story telling...sympathy for the victims and not enough about the others unknown who were seen at the time and the conspiracy theory surrounding the fbi involvement and the cache of arsenal within the murrah building and the other bombs occurring after.....lots of good pics of timothy and his family at least and the army life he lived as well....a good video however it could expand on the others unknown and that extra leg found in the rubble....? from the black woman- leaves me still wondering who really may have been the true culprit...he was involved but i don't think he masterminded the whole thing...still think that joe doe 2 is that padilla guy they caught before anything happened....is terry nichols ex -wife lana padilla's relative.....government is still covering up some information they don't want us to know about.....
2,cleaner,This item was an ok purchase. It wasn't anything ot of the ordinary.Just a cd cleaner. The item was shipped on time and in good shape.
1,Terrible,This movie is terrible! Do not buy! You will be wasting your money. Save your time and buy the original!
1,no good at all,I wasted money on this movie so I took it back and traded it in for something better. The first one was a blockbuster hit compared to this low budget bore. The actors were mediocre to just plain cold as a dead fish. Don't waste your time or money please. This movie doesn't even deserve one star.
1,Four Thumbs DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Horrible. I mean absolutely Horrible..like another reviewer said, its like somebody decided to make a bootleg copy of the first Stomp The Yard..and they Failed...As In EPIC FAIL.Why was the plot the same? And the lead was lame..Its been a long time since I've really been disappointed in a film but this one did it for sure. The first Stomp the Yard set the bar too high. They shouldn't have released this at all. I watched the movie online for free, and I want to warn others don't dare spend ANY money to rent this, and don't even bother using your time to watch it..because that's an hour of your life you can't get back.Pooch Hall did his thing, and Teyana Taylor did a nice job too, but a few good performers couldn't save this sinking ship of a movie. I wish I had an extra pair of hands just so I could give it four thumbs down."
2,Boring,"I wanted to see this movie for a long time and finally got a chance to purchase it. I was so disappointed! It was slow and boring. The storyline was shallow and uninteresting. I was lookong for some of the smooth and exciting dance moves from the original, but alas, they were no where to be found. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Expecting too much...,"I believe I was expecting to much from this movie. The acting was not that great and the dancing was ok. Columbus Short produced this movie but even with his cameo it did not help this movie at all. I really didn't care for the story line, its as if we've seen it all before. Is there nothing new in Hollywood? This movie can not hold a candle to the first one but what sequel ever does?"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this DVD in hopes that I would see Columbus Short in it. Well he had a very small part in the end. It was nothing like the first one. I didn't like the story line. It wasn't true to life. It was awful to me. I gave this DVD to my elder brother. So that's why I'm not giving this a very good view. Certainly after watching it, it wasn't something I wanted to see again and again. But this is my opinion. If you like STOMP with mucho drama - then buy it - You may like it!!!"
1,"Terrible, did not need sequel","The original ""Stomp the Yard"" wasn't the greatest movie but it did not need a sequel. I don't understand why this one was made. It just seems like a remake and tried so hard to be like the original. The writing for this particular film was pretty bad and the plot was messy. This movie was just stupid. Just avoid it all costs. The first one is so much better."
1,NOT WORTH BEING THE SEQUEL,"This is literally the WORST sequel I have ever seen... a very weak, underdeveloped storyline, a ghetto fab soundtrack and NONE of the original people from the first one were in it. Columbus shouldn't have a made an appearance at all because when he did it was brief. I was VERY disappointed in this sequel. I am giving my copy away!"
1,BEYOND AWFUL,"Unfortunately, I prepurchased this DVD thinking it would at least have some great dance scenes. I knew it would not be as great as the first one. The dancing could have been done by any teenager walking down the street. I did love Twitch in this movie and I wish he could have appeared in a better written movie. The story was like a weak, copycat version of the first one. The main character was not charismatic and he had too many issues that did not get resolved at the end of the movie. This movie could have gotten at least three stars from me if Columbus Short had at least danced for a minute to show them how it shoud be done. He was the only bright spot in the entire movie. Whoever did the casting must have been inexperienced. Anyway, the movie was TERRIBLE-TERRIBLE-TERRIBLE!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WAIT UNTIL IT COMES ON TELEVISION FOR FREE AND MAYBE SAVE YOURSELF AND DON'T WATCH IT THEN. AWWWWWWWFUL!!!!!!"
2,Utterly weak,"No need for a long review here. Every dance movie I've seen so far has had a juvenile plot, and this one is no exception. To make matters worse, this style of dancing (stepping) does almost nothing for me. Last but not least, the movie doesn't cast historically black colleges in a favorable light either. The only reason I'm not giving this movie one star is that I can still imagine that it could be even worse. Nevertheless, I can't recommend this movie for any purpose."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!,"Please I beg of you, do not rent nor buy this movie. I understand why they didn't put this in the movie theater but straight to DVD. It is the same story line, the same beginning. It's almost like the Karate Kid part 2/Breakin'. The same moves,same lines everything. I don't even know when Columbus Short comes in the picture because we skipped through the entire movie till the end. And even that was just ""OKAY"". I promise you, this is movie sucked big time. Just watch the first one over and over again, and be satisfied with that."
2,:0(,You can't duplicate what once was. I remember seeing stomp the yard at the movies and was blown away. Did not get the same feeling with this one. The lead Chance I don't feel he was right for that part the casting seems off. The talent was ok. Even with the return of DJ didn't do it for me it seemed forced. I appreciate the effort of part 2 but now i see why it was release on DVD. Not even the ending performance was good or impressive. Again can't duplicate what once was it's rear when you can duplicate and get the reaction you did the first time around.
2,Fire the film editor.,"You won't find incredible scenes here because they're all chopped to chit in the editing room. The story is predictable and banal but I did like how the guys, even the one's from a different frat, stood up for each other to the gangstas. This movie would have improved by one star if we only could have seen the main character's father, played by the imposing Keith David, kick the crappeezee out of the main hood. Otherwise, derivative. Watch the first one or any number of other dance-off type movies."
3,Not At All What I Expected,I Was Very Dissatisfied with This Movie. I love The first one. This one was a flop for me. I Will not recommend this one to anyone.
3,Don't Compare it to the First Stomp the Yard...,"Now, usually when you think of sequels or part 2's, you think they're going to be better or almost better than the first movie. NOT the case with this one, which was very disappointing. It was nothing like the first one and the lead guy, did almost the same dance moves throughout the movie. It was Ok, and that's all I can say about it."
1,JUST AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was very disappointed. The story was very weak, I would have like to see more actors & actresses from the first one return. After all, the title was ""homecoming""...It's definitely not as good as the first one. Don't rent or buy, keep the memories of the first one!!!"
4,Good - not great,I really enjoyed the first Stomp the Yard - this one was good but not as good as the first. Still worth watching though.
3,A directory that could be more user-friendly,"Obviously, ZIP code directories are not products one (usually) getspassionate about. So, don't worry, I won't do that. Still, ifconstructive remarks be permitted, layout and general clarity ofpresentation leave a thing or two to be desired.Other Directories I've seen are at par or better, and while it is notapples to apples to compare book directories to online yellow pages,for clarity of layout the verizon superpages online are good (thoughin my opinion the smartpages are not), and a new directory called[...] is even better.after all this, don't worry: we haven't solved all the world's prob-lems by submitting this mini-article."
2,Outmoded,"Nearly all the book is simply a list of city names and zipcodes. There are a few maps, of a city here, a county there, but not nearly enough maps to make the book worth purchasing. It's basically an outmoded book; perhaps a few decades ago it was essential for anyone doing national marketing, but today it's barely useful. Go to the USPS website, and you will find greater functionality than you could get by owning this book."
5,Olympus Ring Flash,"Works great now. I thought it was broken, but downloaded the current version of the camera firmware. That fixed it."
1,Why bother?,This is the Japanese version of the first album. There are no bonus tracks or special features of any kind. Don't waste your money.
3,Kid fave,"My daughter, age 5, loves this book. We laugh at how silly and insane the pictures are that go with the text. Who illustrated it? We make fun of every page and in turn have read the book about 200 times already. Not a great book, but fun can be had with it."
4,Very good,I am very satisfied with the purchase. The book is in very good conditions as it was specified. It arrived on time as I expected.
3,Total war,I really can't objectively rate this since it was a gift for a family member and I really haven't been given and positive or negative feedback.
1,Game was defective,Tried to install the game on a Win XP computer exceeding the required specs for the game and the game would not work.
1,unfriendly to play,This game was very cheesy. It had poor graphics and was not even close to quality of rome total war.
3,Good but still not like rome total war,I would recommend Rome total war (Rome 2 is coming out in 2013) before this game but it still is fun to play. Not revolutionary in any way. Nice expansions and dcl.
1,broken as shipped,"I played this game years ago and loved it. I figured I'd have another go and bought a copy. Unfortunately it will not run on my system. The problem persisted after installing the 2.01 version. Searching the various message boards suggests that the problem is common, as well as apparently a number of other bugs. I found this game extremely disappointing."
1,These games is not that good bad graphics Atari like,Before you buy any game go on youtube and see the video's of the game you want to buy to see if you like it I bought this RTW gold edition big mistake thought it was going to great based on the trailer video. try looking for the Rome total Total War or/and total war barbarian invasion their pretty good but go see on youtube and judge for your self.
3,More of the same for Stony Man,The Stony Man team is sent searching for a terrorist army threatening the US and it's Persian Gulf allies. There is no indication if they are related to the terrorist armies that threatened the US in books 1 and 2.
2,Not toddler friendly,"I bought these track risers based on previous reviews. I cannot get them to support a track and train to save my life. It may be operator error, but they are incredibly upsetting to my almost three year old son who doesn't understand why the bridge keeps collapsing."
5,Huge Help!,"I built my 2.5 year old's train track design with some tall bridges. However, my rather destructive son kept knocking over the bridges during his rough play. These Elevated Track Foundations are WONDERFUL! Way better than the lame foundations that come in the bulk track sets. These hold up much better to kids' rough play and now I rarely have to rebuild his fallen bridges anymore."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book thinking I would receive numerous ideas to use in my kindergarten class. I was very disappointed in the quality of this book. I was looking for finger plays and most of this book contained songs/rhymes without body movements. The fingerplays that are listed are very common ones, that most adults know from childhood. I was looking for something different. If you are looking for pages full of songs/rhymes (many with out a tune to follow) than this is the book for you. It wasn't for me."
1,Really not worth the price.,"This book transcribes the lyrics of 700 very common poems and songs. There is no other information, it is just a book of lyrics with a few words at the end indication the ""theme."" For example, the lyrics to ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" are in the book with a brief caption afterwards that reads: Theme: Counting.It comes with two CDs that contain 50 of the songs and poems which you probably already have if you've bought more than a handful of children's CDs for your kid.I would recommend checking it out from the library if you really must see it. On no planet is this worth more than $15 at most."
5,Wonderful resourse,"I am thrilled with this book. It is exactly what I wanted. It is well worth the price. It has stories and pictures ready to color to go with the rhymes, stories, etc. The index of activities is 11 pages long. There are 640 pages in the book. There is a Thematic Chart. The book covers games, stories, action stories, listening stories,prop stories,puppet stories, rebus stories, arts and crafts recipes, food recipes, and dances. The book is printed in black and white."
2,Very disappointed; very old fashion; the same old stuff.,I have attended workshops with Silberg and thought her stuff to be fairly good. This book was a lot of money for a lot of older material; which has not even been changed to bring it forward for today! It was disappointing and disheartening!
5,Wow!!!,"Silberg has done an amazing job at gathering, writing, and organizing this fun book. I bought it when my son was two and in the last two years we have done almost everything in this book. I think that the information that is contained within this book is great for any parent of a toddler to have. My little boy is smarter simply because I took the time to purchase this book. I found The Complete Book of Rhymes, Songs, Poems, Fingerplays, and Chants for just a fraction of the retail price on Amazon. It was delivered within a week of being purchased and was in such great condition that it looked brand new!"
5,Great Book,This book is really great. It gave me a whole lot more songs and fingerplays to do with my kids.
3,Picture went negtive!,"I paid $523.00 for VeiwSonic in 2003, I was told the monitor would last for ever. it lasted about 3 years. The picture started going negtive and would come back and finaly gone. It was a good thing I saved my Sony which I am still useing!"
5,Alan Alda Rules!!,Alan Alda is a genius actor in both movies and TV best known for his role in the long running series Mash.This A&E Biography finely illustrates his life and career.It's a must see video especially for Alan Alda fans!!
3,Not exactly for the beginner,"I'm an adult learning how to play the piano for the first time. This book seemed like a good fit, but I was surprised to see how challenging the pieces really are. If this is meant for a kid, he or she has been playing for much, much longer than I have... learning to read more advanced music than a true beginner is able to play."
5,gift giving,"This was given as a gift to a beginner piano player. He loves classical and I thought this would be great for him. Funny thing was, the cover was different than pictured. It came with a picture of children learning piano, which actually made it kind of humorous considering he is an adult beginner."
3,good but short,"Buyers should be aware that this bood has 43 pages of music for 29 songs. You can do the math, many are only 1-2 pages per song. Otherwise it is fine for a beginners practice book."
2,Not thrilled.,I bought this book for my beginning piano students but am not thrilled with the arrangements. Keep looking.
4,This is a way for beginning students to have hands on with classical pieces.,"It is important to me that my kids learn classical music (and art for that matter). This book lets them learn how to play on the piano, in a simplified fashion, pieces I want them to recognize. I also like the brief informative decribing sentences that give etymology to the origin of the pieces."
3,A bit difficult for me,"These arrangements are good, but a bit advanced. I am just not quite ready for this book. It is not self-explanatory. You need to be adept at reading both clefs, time signatures and the fingering is a bit tricky. I will have to slowly work up to it and these pieces definitely require a lot of slow, repetitive practice. Not as easy as Alfred's Basic Piano Course Book 1."
4,Bringing Classics Into My Home,"Even the right hand only player, can enjoy classics from these simple arrangements. The left hand is coming along with practice. This book makes learning the classics less intimidating. I would pay more for a spiral bound version."
2,For very young beginners,"The arrangements are too plain and simplistic. Even though I am only a mediocre player, I did not find them challenging enough."
3,Simple Classical for Piano,I should have gone a level up. This is too simple and only short sections of the compositions are presented. I'm just getting back to the piano after many years and need to become familiar with an appropriate level of difficulty.
1,Convenience of online buying,"When I was scanning the available item, I only saw cassette tapes. I was interested in the music but not happy for n obsolete casette tape. I received the item. It was defective. I emailed the seller. I was told to send it back for replacement.The item cost me no more than $3 + s/h. Now I have to go to the post office to return it. I hate the trips - that is why I buy thru the internet. I have yet to find time - and willingness - to go to the p.o. Defeats the very reason I buy with convenience thru the web.I like that amazon shows a note when I order that I've purchased the product before - found out I already bought the cd 2 years ago. Good thing I didn't order that and a whole bunch more that I forgot I already have. Got to track down what I have already. So I like that little reminder. Kudos to amazon."
2,TRY JERRY VALE,"WHETHER YOU LIKE THIS CONNIE FRANCIS COLLECTION OR NOT, YOU SIMPLY MUST LISTEN TO JERRY VALE DOING THE ITALIAN FAVORITES. BOTH CONNIE AND JERRY ARE ITALIAN AMERICANS, BUT JERRY DOES THEM WITH SINCERITY AND INTEGRITY WITHOUT THE WHINING AND CRYING! JERRY IS ON ""I HAVE BUT ONE HEART"" AND ""ARRIVEDERCI ROMA"" 2-ON-ONE COLLECTABLES CD. ENJOY!"
4,Connie Francis what a star,I had heard that these two albums were really good and they lived up to those expectations.Connie Francis was such a recording star one the the greatest female singers of all time.
5,Connie Francis sings Italian,She is one of the old greats. Her voice is beautiful and she handles Italian very well and best of all you can understand what she says. No screaming and filthy words.
1,Not so good...,"What a disappointment! I'll give these discs away to anybody who wants them. They may be useful to scare birds away from fruit trees by hanging them in the branches. Connie's rendition of ""Volare"" is truly painful!"
2,Save your money!,"These hangers are way too expensive considering their low quality. The fit is horrible, and there isn't even time taken to clean off the sharp edges from the manufacturing process. I paid $49.95 for one of these along with an additional $10.00 in shipping charges. A true disapointment! You could buy 4 quality hangers for the same cost as one of these. It is almost comical just how much they are charging for such a low quality product!"
1,junk,"I bought two (because you dont want to be without music in the boat) of these audio plugs for my I-pod to plug into my boat. They said they were NEW , when they arrived they werent even in a bag, or with a tag. They didnt appear to be NEW. To NO suprise neither of them worked. Its Too much trouble to try to return things so Im out nearly $50, and I had to buy NEW cords on E-bay (which worked great)."
4,Especially Great for Car Travel,"Took the Comfy Commuter on a multi-day car trip, and it was great - made it easy and comfortable to sleep when I was not the driver. Unlike a blow-up pillow, you can easily adjust how snug the pillow is around your neck - keeping your head from nodding and preventing a sore neck. It truly cradles your neck. Now I keep it in my car all the time. I have the version that includes the blanket, and I consider it part of my car earthquake preparedness kit.It is a bit bulky for airline travel, but the attached carrier pouch can be hung on the outside of your carry-on/roller bag, which is fine if you are a commuter (and the fact that the pouch is part of the pillow means you don't have to worry about losing it). Probably would not take on an extended vacation if I was going to be lugging my luggage from place to place using public transportation. Otherwise, a terrific product."
2,Zipper Broke on 1st Use,"The memory foam is nice and supportive, and the pillow case is quite plush and comfortable. HOWEVER, before using the pillow for the first time I removed the pillow case to put it through the wash as it had an odd ""factory"" type smell. Upon reinserting the pillow within the pillowcase, and trying to zip the zipper back up, the zipper actually broke to where one half of the zipper came out of the zipping mechanism and I couldn't get it back together. The pillow still works fine and stays within the case, but the backside of the case can't be closed. I spent about 20-30 minutes trying to get it closed, but to no avail. Maybe with some more time/effort, I could get the zipper back together, but it was just frustrating that the case broke before the first time I could use it.On the plus side, I contacted Amazon about this, and they did issue a refund, so at least my impression of buying products on Amazon remains positive!"
3,Didn't work,"Bought it from One Star Market. What a rip off those people are.It didn't work from day 1. Was told to send it back for a refund.I sent it back and One Star Market kept my money anyway.Amazon should not let theses people operate on their site.If you don't want a really bad experience, stay away from that con artist outfit. R.Ulman"
2,oversold the number and quality of the POIs available free,"Tomtom wants you to BUY most of the POIs that I expected to be included in the unit, walmart, bestbuy, many diners, resturants are not included in the box or available free from Tomtom"
3,TomTom720 Go Review,"I ended up returning the device. My main reason to get it was to have the directions play via the FM transmitter to my car radio, my car radio has no inputs otherwise. Apparently this feature gets purposely disabled/removed as soon as you update the device software from TomTom. Some EU regulation on intermittent fm broadcasting.So if you want the FM transmitter feature in the US this model will not do it for you. Otherwise if this is not an issue the device was fine and worked well."
1,Completely Disappointed About This Purchase,"First of all there was no owner's manual and I was unable to get one on line. I need to return the GPS unit because it has been of no use to me at all. First of all I paid extra for 3 day shipping becaise I was leaving on a trip seven days after placing the order and wanted to make sure it arrived before I went on my trip to Califorrna. On 12-02-2012, the day I left on the trip, I had not received the GPS unit. I was gone two weeks. The GPS did not arrive within eight of my leaving and I had to go without the aid of the GPS unit. Please E-Mail me instruction as to what I need to do to return the GPS unit. I tried to contact Amazon concerning this matter but could not make contact with anyone or obtain an E-Mail address or phone number about who to contact.Awaiting your reply, Sincerely,Lenard Millen"
1,Battery Won't Hold Charge,"This was guaranteed 100% against defects. Well it's defective. It was plugged in and charged over night. Within a minute of unplugging from charger it died due to low battery. Contacted the seller, and have yet to hear back."
3,its a great item but...,"I bought this refurbished item and it looked and performed great and the company TOm Tom even gave me a free map update to have the latest map available.They also allow you to update the device free routinely. It has a great display very sharp and big, the only reason why I gave it 3 star on the review is cause the battery is completely dead. It wont hold any charge at all and will die instantly if unplugged.Other then that,great machine."
2,Disappointed,"I have use the unit for a couple of months now and my observations are that there are better alternatives to some of the routes the device comes up with so if you don't double check the device route to another source, you may not get the most efficient travel plan. I am also disappointed with what I would consider auxilliary info the device provides such as points of interest. On top of that I choose this product over a Garmin which my wife preferred and she doesn't fail to remind me of the decision."
5,Awesome GPS!,"You can't beat the price on this GPSI have been using a Mio GPS that cost the same for a couple of years. When I got this, it was a night and day difference! The Tom Tom is so much easier to operate, the display gives me so much more information.I appreciate that the Tom Tom is able to be updated, and I like the fact that you can download community changes. I have not downloaded any new voices, but the concept intrigues me!Overall, I would definitely recommend this GPS for it's features. I will caution you, that the bluetooth speaker phone feature is a little weak. It works, but if you have a noisy car, you will have a hard time using it for making a call unless you are parked."
1,Worst battery ever with 3 years old map that tomtom refuse to update,"I bought this device 2 month ago and the battery just died and would only last about 3 seconds without connected to outside power source. My previous Tomtom one battery lasted for about 2 months too before I had to use it always with outside power source.Also, it came with version 7.1 map and Tomtom refuse to update it free for me. Stay away from tomtom"
3,"Good Product, Could Be Better","Nice unit, but does not always provide the best (quickest) routing to the destinaion though it gets you there. Has nice feature of lane specific directions. Good entry level unit. Overall satisfied with product for the money."
4,Maps not up-to-date,"I have had my TomTom Go for about a month, but I haven't really used it all that much yet. I chose this one because of the great reviews that I ready, but also because it's supposed to be able to take your target destinations and map the best route. I'm a real estate agent, and I think this might be extremely helpful... especially when I venture out away from my normal territory. I've not put this function through it's paces yet.The maps are NOT up-to-date. Some roads that should definitely be on there are not, and none of the newer roads (1 year or so old) are on the maps. Also, the ""time to destination"" calculation is way off. For example, I traveled to one destination and it said that the time was 24 minutes and on the return trip it estimated the time at 45 minutes... same roads... same speed.The screen is great, the size is excellent... I'm hopeful that the company will improve the maps, and then I would give this gadget a 5!"
1,No Hardware support,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT or ANY OTHER TOMTOM PRODUCTI purchased my Go 720 December 2007. It has had a few problems but generally worked as advertised. It synced with my V3 the first time and I found that the turn distances were acceptable, close enough to tell two close streets apart. But it really doesn't matterThe reason for the 1 star is because I can't give a 0. About 3 months after the warranty ran out and my screen went black. I called TomTom support and was told that if it were in warranty they would replace it. If it is out of warranty buy a new one. That's right, they told me they would not fix it at any price. You are on your own, we don't sell parts and we won't tell you how to get a third party repair. Good luck. Hope your battery doesn't die. Oh, buy the way, we will give you a discount on your new unit if you buy from us at full price. Yeah, right.I now have a $350 paperweight."
3,It has some limitations you should know about,"Just received this unit today as a gift. Since I know where i'm going most of the time, I was really looking forward to traffic avoidance. I have a bluetooth phone, and willing to take on the service charge for the service. But came to find out that this device does not support the Blackberry 8320 Curve, or any Blackberry 8xxx for more than hands free dialing. Additionally, the ability to load the address book is flawed, as it does not bring over names.So, I really wanted others to know about this. It's a great unit, but research its compatibility with your phone if you want to do something more than find your way."
4,TomTom GO 720 4.3-Inch Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator,"I bought this in July 2009. I have been told that the Garmin's have better interfaces than the TomTom's, but I wouldn't know. I can see how the interface has room for improvement as it can be pretty confusing even after using it for about a month now. I bought mine new not refurbed and had no problem updating it as soon as I got it. Other the the interface layout I have not had any problems with the device functionally and it has been very accurate especially in the cities I have been to, but it does seem to get confused in National and State Parks."
1,POS,"I bought the TOM TOM because 2 friends own them. The one I had must have been a lemon. It worked for one week. Then just stopped working. This device was not plug and play. It required down loads every time I charged it with my computer. It would take me home the long way. I have used Garmin devices before, and I will return to them.[...]"
1,Avoid this GPS!!!,"I have owned this GPS for 6 months and although I like the interface, it is useless if you want to take your family on a trip using the POIs. They are consistently wrong. When you do a search for a Mcdonald's for example, it lists it with the correct address but doesn't get within a mile of the correct location. I took my family to New Hampshire to Santa's Village and although the address was correct in the GPS, it took me in the opposite direction as I got close. It also took me up a gravel road in the mountains that was 7 miles long and only for campers. I've updated the software and received the most recent map, but this thing is horrible. Definitely not worth the $500 I paid for it when it came out."
3,Tomtom 720,"What I'm compairing the 720 to, is a Garmin Nuvi 350 that is over 2 years old. The mapping is pretty good, spoken directions may be a touch better than the Nuvi,My cell phone won't match up with the tomtom, bummer.Screen resalution is about equal on both units, which is very good. Points of intrest is a bit weak on the Tom tom as it is on the Garmin. This is a good unit for the money"
2,Mac Client Stinks; TomTom Plus Worthless,"Big warning to all the Mac users, the TomTom 720 is not Mac compatible. TomTom has a Mac client, but it's missing 90% of the cool features found in the PC version. Also, the TomTom Plus traffic feature requires a subscription and a cellphone with bluetooth. The list of supported phones is too short and it took me over 2 hours to get it to work. The unit itself is okay, but without a true Mac client and wonky bluetooth data connection, it's not worth the price and pain."
3,We got a lemon,Was soooo excited to get my wife an upgrade from her old tomtom 700.Found great price on Amazon and with the understanding that we get a free firmware upgrade within the first 30 days after purchase that basically turns the 720 into a 730....I was sold.UNFORTUNATELY....the unit we received from Amazon....the touchscreen was defective! Buttons were highlighting that were not touched...and letters would type all by themselves! sigh!Time to get familiar with Amazon's return policy! =(
2,Does Not Announce Streets By Name,"We returned this product after two days because it did not announce streets by name. It will simply say something like ""turn right"" in so many feet but it does not audibly announce or confirm the name of the street. Our original GPS system was a Garmin which does do this so we were surprised to find that this particular Tom Tom model did not. We ended up buying another Garmin because we found the interface easier to use and it does announce the streets by name. This is a very useful feature and when shopping for a GPS it is probably the most important question to ask."
3,TomTom 720,Great GPS. Functions well as a GPS but would not sinc with my Treo 700wx address book and would not establish a wireless connection for internet. Bluetooth and MP3 works well and connecting to FM radio makes the voice instructions and music sound muh better. Overall a nice unit but TomTom should be more specific about what phones are compatabile with the unit.
2,tom tom go go no,Voice choices are not good. Address book is difficult to use. Or else I can not figure out how to put names on each address. When asking for an alternate route - you do not get to choose which kind. Ex shortest - fastest - freeways.
1,Never Again!,"I'll never purchase another Tom Tom GPS again. This unit is not what it seems. Can't even find a Point of Interest where I live which is in San Diego, CA. I tried downloading POI but it's too much of a hassle. You donwload 1 per POI. Can you imagine downloading 1000? It'll take you a whole year! If there is a negative star, that's what I'll use to rate this. So, I returned the GPS."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the Tom Tom and took a trip to New England. While it got me around there, it did not have a major road in my home state of CO, it didn't have many points of interest I sought, I couldn't sync it with a bluetooth phone and had trouble making the connection with my PC. All of those disappoints lead me to return the GPS"
3,Not so good for Puerto Rico Trips,"I got this GPS to take on a trip to Puerto Rico, & to my sorrow, TomTom has poorly equipped this thing for a trip to Puerto Rico! Its VERY poor at accepting the odd addressing used in Puerto Rico. Making Searching for things a major pain even when you have the address! Another problem is that there are no points of interest for Puerto Rico in this thing at all! not a single airport, gas station, restaurant, McDonalds, is listed in this unit!! nothing! Zero!! So if your going to buy this for a Puerto Rico trip, then its best to look elsewhere, because with this GPS, you are going to have to make your own Landmarks for things as you go along. Hopefully enough people will email tomtom & complain about this so they do something about it. Heres to hope!"
1,Lousy Routes,"I bought this model and must admit it has a lot of extras, but the bottom line is that the routes it chooses are terrible. I plotted several routes on it, MSN Maps, Google Maps, Mapquest and Mappoint. Every one was the same except the TomTom. Some where just bizarre. I returned it and bought a Garmin 750. It cost a bit more and lacked some of the features of the TomTom, but the routes where right on. The basic function of these particular devices is to get you where you want to go and even though they both get you there, the Garmin does it much more efficiently."
1,Disappointed,"Struggled with it from the start. I called customer support and all they did was send me links. Sent back hopefully to get credit and plan on buying a Garmin.It did work well for acouple of days, but then struggled with software and other issues."
1,Worst Experience Ever,"Downloaded new maps following instructions on TomTom Home. Totally screwed up my unit. Spent literally an entire day with 4 customer service tech reps attempting to fix their foul up. After all the ""help"" the unit was even worse than before I called TomTom. The downloads cost me $95.60. Guess what...Nonrefundable. I got to spend close to $100 for them to ruin my unit. Guess that is customer service and relations from TomTom."
3,Maps are not updated!,We purchased the new version of Tom Tom for two reasons. The blue tooth connection. That works well. AND updated Maps.Well the maps aren't updated. I thought when you bought a new one you would get the latest maps...not so ...you can log on and update them ONCE... we don't want to do that right now as we won't be traveling until next summer...
3,not compatible with verizon blue tooth,"I found this item very good with map directions. however, I was just as interested in using it as a handsfree reciever with my verizon phone. I have a samsung phone and tryied several times to connect it. my phone would reconize the tom tom 720, but not the reverse. I finally got a hold of tom tom tech. support and they told me that their service was not compatible with verizon cell service and the brand of phone didn,t matter. It is better to check with tom tom if you are using bluetooth service."
4,tomtom features,"i recently bought a tomtom and overall it has been excellent. The features are very useful but it takes some time to navigate and become familiar with the menus because there are SO many options. If you want a navigation system that is totally custom and personalized, this is the one for you.I thought about buying the optional ipod connection cable but it turns out that the internal memory (and MAYBE an additional memory card) could actually hold all of the music i would listen to. It places the music on the tomtom jukebox and divides it up into a playlist. This is way easier than trying to scroll through your ipod when your driving because it is on a much bigger screen. Additionaly, If you do choose to play your music tomtom stops it inorder to say its directions and resumes play right after... i wish it would just fade out but thats just me."
2,"Whoops... no polarized sunglasses, please","We bought after reading many, many good reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere.It may be a great unit - I only used it for about an hour, though, on my way home.It was excruciating- It seemed to operate really quickly, with a fast GPS lock and quick routing.However, I realized almost immediately I would have to return it as the screen dims really bad if you wear polarized sunglasses. I can't drive with my head at a 45 degree angle!I read that the newer model (the 910 I think) has a different screen, which apparently doesn't cause this trouble.Sorry, but without being usable with polarized sunglasses (which my wife and I both wear while driving) it simply feels like this unit was not designed by drivers. Two stars..."
2,Everything stops working when you update software?,"I was able to make hands free calls to my cell phone verizon vx9900 (lg env2) which is on the list of supported devices. Then it stopped working, it can no longer connect to my phone any longer, so I deleted the entries on each device and tried to pair again. They say ""paired"" but cannot connect via bluetooth. POS!Also, Now I notice I cannot connect to my computer via the USB, so I cannot even back up my device when I reset it to factory default. I contacted service but have not heard back yet. All I can think of is that it was after I updated the device and firmware through the application. What a POS! This is all after a week of having the device and everything worked fine until I updated!"
4,Not Bad,"Nice unit with good graphics. Like some other people, after downloading the most recent maps all I had on my unit was a map of Guam. However, one phone call to the folks at Tom Tom rectified the problem. As I understand the situation, some units have been on the shelf for a while and don't have software upgrades to recognize the newest maps when downloaded. But it was a quick and painless fix. Also, as some have noted in reviews, only the computer generated voice gives street names while navigating. But that's okay. All in all a good product for the modest cost and certainly worth a look. I am still trying to figure out if I can create my own routes to certain destinations and then have them recognized whenever I am heading to that particular location."
3,Tom Tom 720,The Tom Tom 720 got me where I needed to go but finding POI's was very hard. There were very few POI's in the unit. We depend on our gps to find places to eat and this unit did not do the job very well.
2,Had to return it twice,"I love my TomTom 720, except when it broke for no reason. About 4 months after I bought it, the screen just went black. Since then, I've been on the phone with Customer Service twice a week, for many hours. You have to pay for the shipping back if it breaks under the 6 month warranty.It took 2 weeks to get my new one - helpful hint = don't ship USPS! But the new one they sent me didn't work either! So more phone calls later, they are giving me a FedEx label this time and they are paying for the return.If you read this, you need to get the extended warranty at the store you buy it from. Overall, though it product functions well and I really like it. I just wished it didn't break so easily."
3,car charge does not work:(,everything is ok except car charge not working and not having back button for back the page.another thing is notic before 250 feet is too short to turn.
4,"Go, TomTom!","TomTom is a viable force in GPS navigation. The price, added features such as spoken street names, real-time traffic, phone link, etc, are all great. I upgraded gto the GO 720 from a TomTom ONE XL (simply to get the street names)and it was as advertised. And the service from Amazon was the standard that I've come to expect from them. The only complaint is the winshield mount, but I haven't found any better from Magellan, either, so..."
4,"Good product, very helpful","We purchase this item before a 3k mile trip. And it helps us a lot on the way, especially when we were driving on the complex highways in Kansas City. We would not have such a easy trip without it.However, there is some problems, sometimes it took a couple of minutes for it to search for the satellite signals.Overall, this is a very good guy, and we are satisfied with it."
1,Install failures - Big Disappointment,"This product was a big disappointment. The previous reviews showed a mixed history in install problems. I tried it anyway because I had seen it operate in a friend's vehicle - and it operated great.I charged the system, as required, for two hours. My install failed - after the software recommended an update from the latest version available via the web to replace the default install from the CD. All attempts to recover or re-install from here on failed. Whenever the Tom-Tom was turned on and connected to my computer it locked up the system. When I turn Tom-Tom off, everything was fine. The manual reset had not change in this behavior. Attempts to re-install the software had no effect this.The web-page I was directed to by the install disk apologized that the manual was not currently available. The 1-800 phone number did not get through.At that point I lost confidence in this company and returned the product to Amazon."
2,tomtom 720 disappointment,purchased tomtom720 and and a garmin nuvi350 for my wife this past xmas the 720 features are much to be desired if i don't take the route it wants me to keep making u-turns where the nuvi tells you its recalculating and finds the next available route automatically and the poi's don't even exist ask for a dunkin donuts shop tells me 20 miles away where as the nuvi has them all in my town and even all the local resturants to where the 720 doesn't the nuvi came with a case where as the tomtom i had to buy one nuvi tells you you in advance turns coming up the tomtom tells you at the last minute totally disappointed with the tomtom and i did try to upgrade the poi's were the same ones
4,tomtom GO 720,"Works better than origional equipment GPS in my Chrysler and Corvette.I replaced my Garmin because it was hard to read and nmot that accurate.The GO 720 has some address problems, maybe it needs calibrated. I would appreciate any feedback on this problem. Overall I am satisfied with overall accuracy."
2,BlueTooth only works on some Phones,"I had one of the older TomToms that I was happy with, Bought this one for the Blue Tooth to use with my Samsung Model Sph-M500, I found out It would Not Work with this Model, after emailing support. They should have made that known before I bought it, And I would bought one that was Compatible.Capt Tom Stone"
5,No more SPEEDING TICKETS!!,"When I updated my TomTom, it also had a new feature that does away with speeding tickets! How you ask? Well, those three dings just happens to warn you that you are exceeding the posted speed limit! Sometimes my high heels turn into leaded feet so this enhancement has saved me enough money to keep me in Manolo Blatnik's..."
2,Bluetooth issues,This unit had massive problems with connecting to my Blackberry Curve through Bluetooth. It simply wouldn't do it regardless of whether attempted through the GPS unit or the Blackberry. The point of having this syncing is to allow additional features that might make the TomTom fun to use and versatile. I returned it for a Garmin instead.
4,tom tom go 720,"Over all functionality wise, it performs well. A few things come to mind that i didn't like. First, i went to my brothers home a new development, almost two yrs. old.,and all of the streets didn't so up. The 720 said it has the most up to date maps but i supposed not. Another time it thought that there was a road in witch there was a dead end that has been there for 30 yrs.A friend bought a Garmin 760 the time did and the only thing i found different was that the tom tom 720 picked up the satellites much quicker then the Garmin. Its a good tool. BWB"
4,Tom Tom GO 720,"Overall I am very happy with the Tom Tom 720 GPS.The learning curve wasn't bad at all. We just back from a 3,000 mile trip to NC, SC and FL and would have been hard pressed to find some of the destinations without the Tom Tom. My only complanit so far is the inablity to delete single items from the ""recent destinations"" folder. Its either all or none."
3,"Voice speed, accent, Blue-tooth poor , Routing Excellent","The street names are only available in computer voice. The programing apparently has a limited space for the sound bytes for the street name. If it is a longer one, it comes out run together like ""MartinLutherKing"" Boulevard. Boulevard comes out slower, but that is less important.The ""English-USA"" computer voice still has a foreign accent. That combination makes the Street name option in voice navigation useless.Bluetooth fails to connect more often than not.Tom-Tom parts are shipped incorrect, and stock listing on their web site is wrong.Routing is excellent!Route recovery, planning, and corrections are Excellent!Why a picture viewer on a navigator that warns you to keep your eyes on the road?"
4,Delivered,Tomtom 720 delivers. No problems with downloading maps or voices. Paired with my mobile easily. Available voices are enough.
1,Tom Tom refuses to repair this unit,"Before you buy this, or any other Tom Tom product, note that they provide absolutely no repair services after the warranty expires. My unit stopped working two weeks after the warranty expired. When I called to request a repair, the customer service representative informed me that the company will not, under and circumstances, repair a unit that is out of warranty. ,) I was told that I could get a discount on a new Tom Tom via. their trade-in program, despite the fact that our current unit is dead as a doornail. However, when I used their online tool to appraise my unit, the trade-in value was exactly $0.00, due to the fact that it was not operable. So, not only was the representative unable to help me, she lied as well. It's all for the best, however. I will never buy another Tom Tom, and will encourage everyone else I know to follow suit.I am not the only one with these issues:[...]"
4,Larry,"The product, although good, does not recalculate the route as it should and as the Magellan GPS does, that is about $100.00 less."
1,Be careful on this one !,"It has a lot of bells and whistles on it. I bought this for my husband and he tried downloading the new maps on it 4 times (N.America/Guam). He followed download instructions. The only map that downloaded was Guam and that is the only map the GPS sees,... all the N.American maps were deleted with the download of the N.American/Guam new download. So, now he has a GPS TOMTOM 720 that is only good if you are in Guam! Tech support is only Mon-Sat during business hours. I wrote an email but I'm sure I won't hear anything until it is Mon-Sat 9-5."
2,So So,The Tom Tom 720 maps are not very accurate compared to Mapquest or Google Maps. They do not take you directly to your destination. The FM transmitter is not very powerful. It is easier to MapQuest the maps.
3,TOM TOM TOM TOM,"The Good:Performs well, good features, accurate Time of ARRIVAl, Bluetooth pairs well with phonesThe Bad:No external Volume control, Max Volume not good enough when placed on the bashboard. No FM transmissionThe UglySuction cup SUCKSInput not QWERTY takes longer to type.Pay extra for MAPSHARE and everything else ( this is ludacris, when your name is MAPSHARE. GIVE ME A BREAK!)SuggestionsOption to connect sound to Car Radio.Why is the input not QWERTY??"
3,Nice Unit IF YOU GET A GOOD DEAL!,"Got the 720 at a discounted price .. comparable to much lower functional units. That made a great bargain for a device that is both functional and accurate.My complaints: (1) Does not display altitude/elevation. I just assumed any GPS would have that. (2) Don't like the full-screen ""hot touch zone"". If you go to pick up the unit (I don't like mounting on dash because of theft), you almost always kick it into a menu mode. Menu hot spot could be an icon on the main display. (3) Have not found a ""PAUSE"" mode for when you call an audible (rest stop, brief side trip) ... so you keep getting directions to get back on course. But excellent choice for my ""first"" unit."
1,Don't buy TomTom,"I have had MANY problems, first with the 520GO, which I had to send back, then they sent me another new 520, which I ALSO had to send back and now they gave me a 720 and it is sitting here, and it does not work. I have spent many many hours with their tech support online and by phone- they are totally incompetent. I have no idea how they stay in business. I have asked for a refund and they just say ""We do not give refunds"". DO NOT BUY A TOMTOM!!!"
4,hands free on blackberry curve 8300 or 8320,One of the reasons I purchased this GPS was because of the handsfree on mobile ability.But I cannot sync my blackberry 8300Anybody else have this issue
1,Watch Out for Tech Support Issues,"I was happy with my TomTom 720 until it was time to update it. I carefully read ALL the instructions on their web site and followed them to the letter. Now my 720 does not work--I get a flashing red ""X"" and nothing else. I have reinstalled everything multiple times and followed all the trouble-shooting instructions on their web site. I have placed multiple calls to Tech support and it still does not work. The latest was that I was on hold for more than half an hour when a recorded voice told me that they were now closed for the night and I was disconnected. I have been without the system for 4 days now and it is clearly either a software problem or incorrect instructions on their web site."
2,Points of Interest a huge letdown,"I'll skip over all of the details of use and features so thoroughly covered by all of the other reviewers and confine my comments to the points of interest. They are abysmal. Truly awful. The points of interest database must be wildly out of date (I have the latest maps) or extremely limited in scope because you can not rely on Tomtom to get you to much of anything when searching by name. Example: trying to navigate to a Fedex Kinkos store in my area from a direction I don't normally come from the 720 was totally unable to find the store. I would have had to have known the street address ahead of time defeating the purpose of POIs.I've added many lists of POIs to the Tomtom hoping to improve it but no joy - it is useless to me when trying to navigate by name to a store, bank, etc.It is now headed for Ebay and I'm headed either back to Garmin or over to Magellan."
1,Have to much life to live?,"I received this gps and unpacked it, read the manual, loaded the software.I spent 6 hours trying to figure out how to get, and load, the free map update. After 6 hours and 4 attempts to update the maps I gave up. Everytime the maps were downloaded, 1hour 30 minutes on a 5 gig connection, it came up with an error message, different one each time, and failed to update the map it told me was 7 quarters out of date.I then attempted to enter a route to get from my home to my other house. What a frustrating exercise in wasted time.If you have to much time on your hands you may wish to go outside and drive a few nails through you hand, it will be just as enjoyable and useful as the time you will waste trying to make this thing useful.The manuals are crud, the company website is useless, the software is slooooow, complicated, obtuse, and useless. The box, packing materials and case are ok."
1,Has never charged properly!,"I bought the TomTom for my daughter. We liked the ease of use and clear directions, but it was clear that this was a defective product from the beginning. The cord that came with the device would not charge it. We bought a new cord. That also didn't work and it became clear that the problem was with the unit itself. It requires a person to hold the cord in the unit to make enough contact to charge the unit. Even that does not do a perfect job - who wants to hold a cord in a unit for hours while it charges?My daughter tried to make do with it while she was away at college but it came to a point where it would not charge at all. She brought it home and I found after some research with Amazon and TomTom that it was too late to return it. I am out nearly $200. Buy another more reliable brand."
3,The Arab Legions by one of its British commander,"I found this a rather interesting account of the birth of the Jordanian army. It was interesting to read his comments on the difficult that were faced in creating and fielding such a force which unlike other armies in the region was created on the cheap. I found many little details astonishing eg morse was not available in Arabic so the Arab signal officers could not understand the messages that they were sending but were able to receive and send it extremely well. This may have in reality have had an advantage to some extent.What I did find strange was that it appears so little was done to create Jordanian officers, to slowly take over the force. Surely something could have been done earlier.I also found that the pictures displayed the text well."
2,Flimsy at best,"Very disappointed in this table. For what I paid it looks cheap and is very flimsy. I could have gotten a better table, cheaper, at a big box store. If you want something just to look at this table is fine but if you plan on using it on a daily basis, DON'T waste your money."
5,GORGEOUS STATUE,"Gorgeous statue with great detail and quality, I am so happy to be adding her to my garden. I purchased a second statue for my daughter-in- law's birthday. Couldn't be happier."
3,inexpensive alternative to custom printed invoice forms,"These are printed forms were designed to be used with the SmartInvoice software package. However, I picked them up to use them with QuickBooks. After tweaking the QuickBooks templates for estimates, invoices, purchase orders, and sales receipts, I was printing them in my laser printer.The forms are blank except for color boxes where you'd normally print the invoice detail, terms, and ship to, bill to, and other information. On the bottom, there is a perforated section that customers could tear off and return with payment. Unfortunately, the perforated section is only the last 3 inches of the page, making it too small for a windowed #10 envelope.Still, these blank forms can be used to make your invoices and sales receipts a little more professional.I took off two stars because there are no Word templates, or QuickBook templates, and it requires some effort (and time) to set your software up to use them."
1,"Warranty not honored by Moog, no replacement hardware","The part looks fine but it does not come with a nut or cotter pin. You will have to come up with your own hardware, which I find highly irritating.-- UPDATE 7-22-2011 --I had to return this to Amazon because its very difficult to find the castellated nut and Moog does not sell the nut separately. Furthermore I talked to a Moog representative who told me Moog does not honor the Limited Lifetime warranty on products sold through Amazon since Amazon is not an official Moog supplier. Apparently you have to go through a brick-and-mortar store to keep the warranty valid."
3,Missing Nut!,I got home to find the box at my door. Upon examination there was a hole in the packaging and the castle nut was missing. I used the old nut however it does not fit properly. It's been several weeks and I've not been able to find a replacement. Other than that the part was installed easily and the fit was perfect.
3,Bit Shakey,"While it is interesting hearing Neil young Comment on his life, one would be better off buying the book Shakey."
5,Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide (2nd Edition),"My dentist had this book in his office. After reading through many of the topic headings, I just had to get it. Now that I have it, I can't put it down. This book explains the difference between traditional and alternative med. as well as the different approaches to alternative medicine. It also directs you where to get more information on the subject you are look at.It is the most comprehensive book on the subject, I have found so far. If you want to learn more about alternative medicine, this book will be a good pick."
4,one stop shopping for investigating alternative medicine,"This book was recommended by a doctor at my company (insurance, no less!). I have just started reading it, but especially appreciate how various alternative approaches are grouped together under specific illnesses/problems. Very helpful in trying to decide which way to go. Complete with ""next steps"" in pursuing the approach of your choice. Looking forward to deeper study in connection with my own and my family's general health and chronic conditions. Worth the bucks. The book you should start with in researching holistic and alternative medicines."
5,Alternative Medicine Guide,This guide has the information I wanted in order to decrease my reliance on pharmaceutical meds. It is very helpful and detailed and actually has more information than I anticipated in terms of different modes of treatment. I have already found it useful. Thank you.
4,A Valuable resource!,"This extensive work has been a valuable reference tool both for myself and my clients. As a practitioner of holistic medicine, I work w/ persons who are interested in many different treatment options.The set up of the book, first into modalities, then divided by diagnoses/health topics makes it easy to use. A must have for all those whose search for healing takes them beyond the scope of services offered by their HMO."
3,"Information excellent, book condition disappointing","I was very happy with my choice of this book. The information is what I had hoped for, but the condition of the book was very disappointing. It is coming apart in the middle. There are gapping holes there. I'm concerned about the life of it. Not pleased with the condition of the book at all."
2,AlternativeMedicine: The Definitive Guide,It's OK But dated I thought it would more up to Date . My mistake I should have checked the publishing Date:
2,"It's OK, but far better review books exist","This book does provide a decent preparation for the physics GRE, but there are no examples where problems are actually solved. It is also lacking in letting you know exactly what is needed for the test. The questions are multiple choice out of 4 instead of 5 so the simulation of an actual test is flawed. I'd suggest the Barron's review book which has numerous practice exams, and actually goes through and solves every question."
1,Awful GRE prep,This book is more suited for SAT prep. Questions are way too easy and aren't even close to simulating the physics GRE. The book doesn't even give explanations for answers - just tests and answer keys. Not worth it.
1,Really an algebra-based high school physics review,"This book really is a collection of sheets of review questions that were apparently made up for an algebra-based high-school physics course, and so the book is at much too low a level for physics GRE review. There are a _few_ higher level questions thrown in on rare occasions, but even these are not at all at the level of the physics GRE. The answers to the questions (all multiple choice format) are given, but there are no worked out solutions for any of the problems. There are no short review sections (as can be found in most other review books), just the multiple choice questions. A very misleadingly-titled book. (This review written by a college physics prof.)"
1,Totally Unsuitable Book for the Physics GRE Test,"This is not the right book to use when you prepare yourself for the Physics GRE test. The book is outdated; the problems presented in the book will never appear in the real Physics Test. It's better to use the availble tests from ETS along with some self studying from textbooks like Griffiths E/M and Q/M, Marion Classical Mechanics etc. Do not waste your (valuable) time on this book!!! It will also discourage you since some of the problems are much harder than the ones of the real test."
1,JB,"Just got this today, went to the garden and about 2 or 3 pushes through dirt and middle digger breaks off! Sheared right at the bolt. Wasn't even being hard on the unit. I would suggest folks steer away from this one. I'm going to buy a Garden Weasel instead."
1,Stay away,The first tine broke off at the screw on the third roll. About two minutes later the head snapped in half. I'm very disappointed that anyone would sell such a poor product.
1,Broke on first use,First few rolls back and forth and the center of the three blades broke off at the bolt on top. Few more minutes of playing with rolling it and one whole side broke off. We weren't even pushing that hard just rolling it back and forth. I'd avoid this. Thankfully the store is letting us return it for a refund.
5,A great multi-vitamin!,This multi-vitamin has everything you need in two pills. Great value and very easy to swallow. I highly recommend them.
4,"Simply put, Beautiful!","This table assembles very easily. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the ""leather look fiberboard"" insert on the top. Simple fix, I went to my local glass company and purchased a 1/4"" thick 12 7/8"" x 21 1/2"" table top glass, now this table is not only beautiful and functional, but it will stay that way for years to come. Coasters or no coasters, don't think about setting anything on the top without adding the glass."
3,Side table delivery,The table arrived damaged. Very poor packing caused damage to the door piece. Will not order from you again.
1,can anyone put Humpty back together again?,"This product, in my opinion, is NOT a do-it-yourself one. I'm an average handy type, but am in over my head. I'm great at getting things apart. Er, it's getting them back together again that's the rub. That's the case here. My Palm is now in several piece (w/o the new battery in place) as I took it apart, following directions, but could NOT get the battery replaced - I don't solder, so I wish I'd known you've got to unsolder the old battery and resolder in the new one. Hm, not in the instructions anywhere. SO now I've a box with the cover, and the little insert, and the screws and..... it's not worth it."
3,"This seat is acceptable, but Compass is better","I bought this seat a year ago along with a Compass Deluxe for our two cars.Pros:- lower price than Compass- stylish lines- removable back makes it easier for traveling (assuming your child is tall enough to use the backless mode)Cons:- after one year, the seams on the seat are starting to come apart- cup holder sticks out at an awkward angle and is not easily removableOverall, I would recommend the Compass over this one if it's your only booster seat. But if you need a second, cheaper one, this one is OK."
5,Riddle unriddles Dioscorides,"This book is probably the only modern treatment of Dioscorides. It is certainly the best.It is almost impossible to obtain a copy of Dioscorides' text in any language. Dr. Riddle makes reading the original almost unnecessary and it is a pity that his book is already out of print. Anyone with an interest in Greek, and therefore Western, uses of plants as medicines will be unable to put this book down."
4,3-1/2 stars - early '80s Ella.,"A soft-fusion jazz take on the works of pioneering Brazilian bossa nova composer Antonio Carlos Jobim... Originally issued as a double LP, this set is vintage early-80s Fitzgerald, with Ella throwing herself into the songs wholeheartedly, despite the somewhat cloying and cluttered, too-smooth performances of the band. Jazz cats Alex Acuna, Oscar Castro Neves, Paulinho Da Costa, Clark Terry and Toots Thielemans are among the heavy-hitters who back her up... The album as a whole is a bit busy, but the English translations are kinda nice, as are Ella's game attempts at singing in Portuguese (she does alright, though her accent is irrevocably tempered by learning Spanish first...) Both Ella and Jobim have had better days, but this still has some nice moments, and even a few surprises."
5,Ella and Jobim - the PERFECT combination,"I absolutely adore this CD. I still have it in vinyl. This is the very last ""Songbook"" that Ella recorded - it's a Pablo release, originally recorded back in 1980 and 1981. Produced by the great Norman Granz. The musicians on this recording are the best that could be found - Joe Pass on guitar, Zoot Sims (wait until you hear some of his solos) and Clark Terry. Some fabulous Brazilian percussionists.Pick a quiet night, a bottle of good wine and this music playing. What heaven.Trust me, you'll love this"
4,THIS TIME ELLA SINGS JOBIM,"ELLA FITZGERALD MADE QUITE A LIVING DOING A SERIES OF ALBUMS THAT FEATURED INDIVIDUAL COMPOSERS, HER ""SONGBOOK"" RECORDINGS. THIS ONE FEATURES ELLA DOING JOBIM SONGS. RECORDED ON THE PABLO LABEL IN THE 70'S, IT MAY NOT BE HER ALLTIME BEST RECODINGS, AFTER ALL, SHE WAS GETTING UP THERE IN AGE AND HER VOICE WASN'T QUITE WHAT IT HAD BEEN. BUT.......I WOULD STILL RATHER HEAR ELLA SINGING AT 75-80%, THAN A LOT OF OTHER SINGERS AT ALL. A GOOD CD, IF YOU LIKE ELLA THEN YOU WILL ENJOY IT. CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS ALBUM INCLUDE ALEX ACUNA, JOE PASS, ZOOT SIMS, CLARK TERRY, TOOTS THIELMANS, AND OTHERS AS WELL."
4,An Englishman gives lessons on how to be French,"I bought this book at Shakespeare & Co. in Paris before there was an Amazon.com to offer it at such an excellent price. Still I feel I got my money's worth. It is true the essays in this book rely a lot on the opinions of the author but Theodore Zeldin has supplemented them with interviews, cartoons, charts, and footnotes which leave the reader feeling he has stumbled upon a textbook of the highest order. Whether you are wondering about French humor (what's with that Jerry Lewis thing) or which blood types are the most common the information is here. Save yourself a lot of money, buy the book here and enjoy."
5,GREAT HELP WITH UNDERSTANDING THE FRENCH !,I GOT A LOT OF INTERESTING FACTS AND INFORMATION FROM THIS BOOK.IT WAS ENTERTAINING & FUN TO READ.MAUREEN
1,No quality controls. Zero.,"The first order we received had no fewer than 5 major defects. But how a company can ship a piece (the front piece) that has had an entire foot split off, I'll never know. I'm not kidding. The entire bottom-left 5"", gone.The replacement was better, but that's not saying much -- the first one had no foot on one side, after all; how this meets any measure of quality controls, I'll never knowThank goodness for Amazon's so-far excellent return policy."
3,MUSIC ALMOST INAUDIBLE,"I love Leontyne's voice and have other albums of hers...after having read the reviews, I ordered the CD but am a bit disappointed. First of all, it sounds as if it's HI FI not stereo and the music is barely audible...and for a Christmas album, even with a beautiful voice, I would love to have been able to hear the accompanying music."
5,"game-who,what, where?","This is a game that can be played with a group and we had so much fun with it at Thanksgiving that I ordered one for each one of my children for Christmas. I am hearing back from them about how much fun they had with their friends over the Christmas and New Year's holidays. It is a drawing, guessing game that will have you in stitches."
5,Hilarious & Entertaining for everyone!,"This is our absolute favorite family game. Whenever we have a new couple over for game night it's the first one we pull out and when people come over they request we play it. Not only is the art pretty funny but the answers folks come up with are great! My young kids can even get in on the action (even though there is, and we own, the Jr. version too!) by drawing something we come up with and participating in the guessing (their answers are sometimes more funny then ours). You can make this game as short (just playing one round of draw and guess) or as long (playing the recc. 3 rounds or more) as you'd like. FUN FOR EVERYONE :)"
4,very interesting drawing game!,The game who what where is a very good drawing game that supplies hours of fun for the whole family.
3,Too expensive; ZERO lasting power,"I have several pairs of Spanx and Mama Spanx. In my opinion, they run too easily, and at $20 a pop, that's expensive."
4,Perfect for Quilting Moms,"The quilt blocks in this book are so much fun to make! Experienced quilters can use many different types of fabric to give the quilt dimension, but one-dimensional fabrics work well too. The instructions on applique could have been a bit more detailed, but they are probably enough for firt-time applique'ers. 15 blocks to choose from allows you to make a project of any size."
4,"Sweet stories, cute quilts","Who wouldn't love Kermit and Miss Piggy? But the real surprise was the charming quilts and the stories that went with them. Not only does this book have simple designs that you can use, it is filled with a series of quilts that the staff of the Henson company has made over the years. They are not quilters, but they are certainly artists who know their way around a needle. They have creatively mixed traditional blocks with Muppet blocks for a series of Friendship quilts that will open your eyes to the possibilities in that traditional form. Even if you have no children, you will enjoy looking through these pages."
2,"Works okay, but I've had better","The cleaning solution is only mediocre, as well as the cleaning pad. It barely gets fingerprints off, and that takes a lot of work on your part. I've had other cleaning systems that I prefer to this one. Unfortunately my previous system is no longer available, so I guess I will keep looking."
2,Lousy workout,"I wish I'd read the review on under 5'3"" as I'm only 5'0"" and need to put a pillow in the back to make this work. Then there's the issue of those 11 levels of cycling, that just don't seem to change the intensity of the workout. Don't know if mine was broken or if they never work but I wasn't getting much of a workout at the highest intensity level. I know they're not currently selling this model but I'm going to get rid of mine and buy another piece of equipment."
1,You get what you pay for--if that.,"Sadly, this model lacks in every aspect. There is little to no challenge, some parts are ill-fitting, and the model has only one position. Legs and weapons do not move. There are no joints, just pre-formed plastic. It just sits there like a plastic hood ornament. Worst model ever."
5,Dr. Kiss has outdone herself!,Dr. Kiss is THE authority on aquatic therapy. Everything you could possibly want to know on the subject is in this book. Wonderful reference!
3,It Does The Job....But....,It does what it is intended to do but there are better products out there...like the CD2000 line which is made right here in the USA instead of china!CD Fix-It Kit
5,First fun activity book I've found that a busy mom can use.,"There are several other great activity books out there. But this is the first one I can actually use almost anytime, any where, and with my spouse or with my kids, no matter what I'm doing, whether it's cooking, eating dinner, shopping, doing chores, at the office...really anything, even arguing. And simple clear directions make these games and antics someof the easiest to use of the family activity books I've seen."" --Diane Brodkey (elementary school teacher and parent of a six yearold and eight yearold.)"
5,For the serious actor or the beginner.,"This is a great guide for those who are experienced actors or for others who are beginning their journey as potential actors. Morris' lessons and point of view are powerful, intuitive and refreshing at the same time."

1,Should be excellent,"I like the features and the control I can get with this product, but there are some major problems.1. Rendering time is horrible. A 37 minute DVD took so long to render & burn that I went to bed after a couple of hours. I tried a similar length DVD render/burn with ULead VideoStudio 6 SE (came with my firewire card) and it didn't take long at all - less than 45 minutes or so.2. The software has an annoying habit of corrupting and telling you that either your serial number is bad or that it cannot open and you must reinstall the software. I've downloaded at least 3-4 patches for Pinnacle Studio 8 and it might be working okay now. Time will tell.Summary? If you don't mind the bugs and rendering/burning overnight, Pinnacle is fairly easy to understand. If you want faster times, use ULead."
2,Even version 8.8.17 has problems,"I purchased a fairly top-of-the-line system just so I could use this product (2.4 GHz Pentium 4, 800 MHz bus, dedicated SATA 120 gig hard drive, 1 gig of 400 MHz DDR RAM), but am disappointed that I still have problems with version 8.8.17. It has a very bad bug where it allows the audio and video to get out of sync when making DVDs (a showstopper in my opinion).DO NOT use this software if you have a deadline to meet. It is not completely realiable. I have spent countless late nights trying to work around and research problems I've had with this product.It's reedeeming quality is an extremely well designed user interface. If everything worked as designed, every time, this product would be a joy to use. But my expereience indicates it's still not ready for prime time. (Read Pinnacle's message boards if you want to see confirmation of this.)"
2,The release: Studio 8.8.17,"Well, about 2 weeks ago, I had originally written a really nice review of this software. Now I am having to completely retract it, as my position has totally changed. Even upon upgrading to version 8.10 (ten) from 8.8.17, the software is proving to be unbelievably unstable and buggy. Really a sad deal. ... The interface is really nice. When the software works (about 15% of the time) its really nice. But after two weeks, I am disgusted. ..."
4,A Good package,"Well i have an moviebox usb too and ehh no problems at all !Only rendering is quit slow (i'm using FULL h/w acceleration now and it takes about 5 hours for an 2 hour dvd, but while most people are complaning about the a/v sync, its better here than the Ulead media software witch gives me over 5 seconds delay!It seems that studio is also depending on directx (and youre video-adapter)i'm usingHardware: Amd 2000+ with 512 mb ram 80gb and 120gb harddrive,NEC1100a dvd-burner.Gforce 4MX440(64mb),sb-audigy,usb 2.0 bla bla blaSoftware : windows XP,Pinnacle Studio 8.10,directx 9 and always the latest drivers!And its realy giving me no trouble, by the way, if you record youre video directly on the disired bitrate then rerendering is very fast!!"
5,CIA Masters Collection 3-1/4-Inch Very Fine Mesh Strainer,This is an awesome product. Strains great!! I would recommend this product to everyone I know. The very fine mesh makes straining so much better.
3,Too small for me,"The quality of this item is fantastic. However, I didn't realize how small it was and it didn't fit my needs - therefore I returned ti for a larger size."
3,Average,Not a bad report of what took place although the topic could be a bit dry for the average reader. The dust jacket tries to make the book out to be a bit sexier then it really is. The authors do a good job or moving the story along but I did expect more from Beaty. I think what is interesting is some of the same move movement issues covered within the book are now coming to the forefront with the current crack down on terrorists. If you are interested in the topic of international banking then this book will be interesting.
4,They work like you would want them to,"When building elaborate track sets, these pivoting accessory pieces are great to have to help things line up right. For more flexibility, get a set of the ""Wacky Track"" and some male-male, and female-female track adapters as well. That will help insure it will all go together for your favorite Thomas fan."
1,So sad...,"that people who read Return to Creation believe that Francis Talbot is sharing actual indigenous wisdom. What he is sharing is new age philisophy that has had a detrimental impact in Indian Peoples. I'm pretty confident that those giving positive reviews of the book did not grow up in an Indian community (a real one, a rez, reserve or in Indian Territory). It continuously surprises me that non-Native Peoples feel they have the right to dictate to Indian Traditionals. Francis Talbot is an exploiter. He is doing more harm than good in the prison systems and exploits the prisoners as well, bilking donations to fund a program that consists of him going into prisons and talking about himself. I feel bad for the people he has managed to misinform with his hogwash. I feel bad for the indigenous community and prisoners he continues to profit from. I am glad to know that the American Indian Movement is compiling information on his nefarious behavior."
4,Pearl Harbor is Burning!,"The story takes place in Hawaii, where two boys from very different backgrounds become friends during the strike on Pearl Harbor. This short story is a very good read. My only complaint is that the story ends too soon. The author took time to develop characters but ended the story. It really makes you want to know more about what happens to them in the aftermath of the attack. This book would be a great choice for teachers to read in their classrooms in light of recent events."
4,Pearl Harbor is Burning,"This is a story of two fifth grade boys who witness the bombing of Pearl Harbor. One is Japanese, the other American. The story is more about the boys and their different families, life-styles, and cultures, than about the historical event of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The bombing is centered around the relationship of Frank and Kenji. Frank's character makes a turnaround in his feelings toward people who are different from his family. The story is historically accurate and fast-paced. It would be appropriate for 9-12 year olds. This book could also be the starting point for numerous group discussions, such as racism and inhumane treatment of those who are different. The pencil sketch illustrations are very appealing."
2,Beware,"Beware of the currrent version of the exam--640-801 and 811! It seems to be designed to eatup and spit out newbies. I recently took it to recertify my ccna and narrowly failed it after easily passing the practice exam included with this book.This book covers more material than I think you need to know, but does not cover all of the material you'll need to know! Most importantly is that the router simulation questions included are much easier than they should be. I scored a 90 on the practice exam and failed the ccna. Beware."
2,Loosing my mind!,"I have read through this book 2 times now and have failed the ICND test 2 times as well. I had purchased the Intro book as well and passed the test with flying colors. Upon finishing the second book I thought that I had a pretty good understanding of the material covered but when I went to take the test I was wrong. I have gone over the material in this book so much that I can answer every book, CD, and exam test engine question correctly in my sleep. When it comes down to it, about 25 percent of the questions on the test are not covered in this book. It has good information, just not enough information. If you plan on buying this book you should consider buying another to go along with it and read that one as well before you test. Which one...? That's where I'm at - it's on to another book and hopefully a 3rd times a charm ICND test."
3,Well it helped me pass the test,"This book and the 640-821 book was all I used to pass the 640-801 test. The 801 book was not out at the time. But the books are missing some things you need to pass the test (I.E: dial up and interface details). The router software is ""ok"". Boson wants you to spend an extra $150 to get the full software to do some of the labs.That skinks and is underhanded of them. I had to take the test 2 times to pass because of the missing information. If you use these books go to cisco and download the 2500 - 2600 trouble shooting manuals and read them."
5,A prefect choise for CCNA exam preparation,"CCNA INTRO Exam Certification Guide and CCNA ICND Exam Certification Guide by Wendell Odom are prefect choise for CCNA exam preparation. Both books are easy to read for non-native English speakers (like me), all concepts are well explained and illustrated with good examples. Books also covers all exam topics, I used only those books for exam preparation and I answered all questions except one."
2,Recurring problem,I purchased this book set and passed the INTRO exam easily but have failed the ICND exam twice. I found the exam to be much more difficult than the practice questions. The exam gave me 60 minutes and at the end of 50 minutes I still had several questions left. Starting to have doubts as to whether this book was the best source of my study material.
4,Arrived smushed...,"Good thing batteries can take that treatment. The battery box (thin and flimsy cardboard) was broken apart, and the batteries were rolling around in the box. At least it wasn't a bubble envelope, because these still work!"
5,They Work; I'm Happy,"Bought these for my window candles. They're still going strong, so I have no reason to complain. Case was cardboard (rather than plastic), so I was able to recycle it."
5,Energizer C Alkaline,great batteries great price.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purcha Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?
4,So far so good.,"I purchased this bulk pack to power a variety of kids toys. So far, the batteries worked as they should. Time will tell if they last a long enough, but so far, so good."
4,Dancing Music,"Deep,rhymtic,and easy to march to. Brings tears to heart, and beer to your lips...I stongly recommend this album."
4,Relevant 80s electronics,"Cluster has been making challenging and relevant electronic music for forty years from free form proto-industrial (see Kluster)to the glitchy minimal electronics of Qua and the music always has a certain Cluster vibe. Curiosum is interesting because when many Krautrockers had lost the path and gone into new age or main stream rock, Cluster continued to explore a mix of pop and avant garde beats and grooves that sounds timeless. Check out the tracks and if you're a Cluster fan you'll find this album worth buying."
1,This is from Burpee?,This is a very primitive low quality product. Certainly not worthy o f carrying the name burpee
3,good but not great,Subtle flavor and great aroma. It is a bit overpriced for the quality of the overall experience. It is a decent tea but nothing to write home about. While it is good it is unlikely I would get it again.
2,Can't recommend,"Blood of the Samurai is not a good flick; not even for a b-movie. A half-baked story, really bad dialogue, and poor acting (except for Micheal Ng) combine to make it impossible to enjoy. Don't believe the hype, especially those that give this a 5-star rating.It even has a disclaimer in the beginning, explaining to the viewer that it's ""camp"" and should be made fun of. If it were any good, you'd think they could leave that up to the viewer to decide?As much as I'd like to support local (Hawaii) filmmakers, i can't recommend it, especially not for $26."
2,Can't Recommend,"Blood of the Samurai is not a good flick; not even for a b-movie.

5,Fun ! A great 1st film,"You can feel the love, the energy coming from the director. And it makes this film enjoyable to watch. It also shows promise: see BOTS The Series, and Ninja EX.(^_^)Support your local indie filmmaker!"
5,Beats KILL BILL,"Anyone who thinks KILL BILL is the first and last word in chambara/grindhouse kung fu films really need to see this earlier film.BLOOD OF THE SAMURAI may not have a hip soundtrack, name actors, or much of a budget, but it does have a lot of love for the genre. It borrows from HOUSE WHERE EVIL DWELLS, NINJA III: THE DOMINATION, and every show ever on KIKU-TV, but it deosn't have a rip-off feel to it the way KILL BILL does. Oh yeah, it also beats KB's over the top blood spurting with some interesting(and surprising) effects by Screaming Mad George.If you wanna see an honest tribute instead of someone's egofest, watch this!"
1,The Peeler takes too much apple,"We had an old model/original patent ""Apple Peeler Slicer Corer"" for over 30 years, that finally gave up the ghost last year. I replaced it with two of these - the second one for our vacation home. The peeler knife is different from the original, with a ""looped"" blade supported by a a ""fixed"" arm that is sprung fart to tightly. The peeler blade takes far too much apple with the peel and ""maul's the apple in the process. Very unsatisfactory. Not at all pleased."
5,A good read!,"I enjoyed Ms. LeBlanc's first book and this one is even better. Vibrant characters and a chilling concept make this an exciting read. If you are looking for a true storyteller, this one is for you.Can't wait for her next one. I'm officially a fan now!"
5,Really scary!!,", I adored this novel. Deborah LeBlanc's masterfully drawn characters command the narrative in this dark and brooding novel set in a Louisiana funeral home. A deftly conjured atmosphere of onrushing doom overlays a fast-paced and suspenseful story in which a gold coin is stolen from the stiffly clenched hands of a 19-year-old girl's corpse, a theft that plunges the owners of the funeral home, Janet and Michael Savoy, into a desperate search for the missing coin that must be placed in the dead girl's grave before the second sunrise following its disappearance or a member of the Savoy family--and they fear it will likely be their own daughter--will suffer a hideous death. This is a claustrophobic tale of dark magic and deadly spells that could only rise like a black miasma from the Bayou swamps. Louisiana writer LeBlanc cranks up the horror, drawing the reader into nightmarish landscapes of a countryside she understands so well. This is a heartstopper. Don't miss it!"
4,"Misa Luba 5 stars, everything else 0 stars","Finally the original (circa 1960's) Misa Luba is available on CD. That makes this CD well worth owning. The Misa Crolla and Misa Flamenca that are also on this CD are no more than filler and add nothing except inconvenience to the CD. I would much prefer a CD that contains both sides of the original LP of the Misa Luba and nothing else. Unfortunately, this CD omits the off side of the LP.The DVD contained in this package is about the Kenya National Choir production of the Misa Luba (circa 1990), a much inferior rendition compared to the original which is contained in this CD, and is of virtually no interest. Why would the consumer care about a biopic of a poor impersonation?Despite all the filler, this is definitely worth owning."
1,An extremely disgruntled Firm Believer,"This video deserves no stars ...Based upon the reviews ofthis video and the reputation of The Firm, I purchased Cardio Burn.Not only am I thoroughly disappointed, I am ashamed to call myself a Firm Believer. I've been doing The Firm videos for years. I've suffered through the wonderfully painful floorwork of Susan Harris and decided it was time to add some freshness to my workout routine. So, I bought Cardio Burn and soon discovered that this is not the video to purchase. The choreography is sloppy. If there are other Firm Believers out there pondering whether or not they should buy this video ... JUST SAY NO! It is simply awful."
4,A good short challenge.,"This is a great workout for those who are pressed for time and want to pack a lot of work into a short amount of time. However, the other reviewers are correct in that the footwork (especially on the lifter) is tricky. I have quite a few Firm workouts and have not had a previous problem with the choreography, but the speed at which Tamela works did pose a safety issue. That being said, this is a fun workout and the time goes quickly. You will need weights, a step (or fanny lifter). Although she uses a weighted ball, you can make do with a dumbbell. The first part of this workout (approx. 30 minutes) is all cardio, with the remaining 20 minutes devoted to upper and lower body strength moves, and a short segment on abs."
4,Value for money,"This book gives an extensive tour of the history of male nudity in photos. The text is interesting, but it is of course the photographs that catches the eye... From early anonymous photographers, to the present stars Mapplethorpe etc., we are given the chance to explore the natural beauty of male nude photography."
3,"Yeah, Some Are Noisy","My opinion of this fan isn't as extreme as the previous reviewer, but he's somewhat correct. The weakest feature is the clear plastic curved piece that is snapped into the aluminum frame, and is supposed to guide the air flow. Out of the several I've bought and am using, only one of them rattled loudly. It made me think at first that I had a major problem with my processor fan. (I was entertained by his use of the term ""wood chipper"".)If you buy this, you may get a long-lasting quiet one, or you may get a loud noisy one. Take your chances. One solution would be to use hot-melt glue to secure the plastic piece.I have no problem with the amount of air it moves."
5,Great sociological science fiction,"Octavia Butler was a great writer and this trilogy is one of her best. Any SF fan who enjoys reading about alien cultures will be thoroughly engrossed. Great characters and a compelling plot in well written novels that are tremendously creative and thought provoking. Fans of Ursula Le Guin and James Tiptree, Jr. will not be disappointed."
2,My touchy feely gene must be broke,"It is possible that I am WAY TO SHALLOW to appreciate this book.There may have been a WARNING stating ""If you have testicles don't read this book""If there was I missed it.This book is about understanding, accepting, and appreciating differences between people.That's what I got out it at least.Unfortunately that's not what I wanted to get out of it.I was looking for Test tube cross-alien universe dominating laser toting exobadass mutant human.What I got was a hug.I'm now off to get in touch with my inner child or whatever the hell that's supposed to be."
3,Up and down,"Parts of these books were so good I could not put it down but other parts were soooo boring that I could barely pick it back up. All in all, an interesting concept."
1,Great concept - very poor execution,"I love sci-fi and fantasy and this was too much for me. I think I could have even went along with the alien-human sex if the character development had been there to help. The characters are flat as paper and the story leaves waaay too much unexplained, untouched. This book reminded me of a 20% complete rough draft that might have had potential had the author put some effort in to flesh the details out and involve the reader. Waste of money."
1,the aliens bully mankind,"After buying and reading book one and before I forked over money for the rest of the trilogy I decided to read the book ""off the shelf"" at my library. What a bore!!! I really expectedthe author to dive into a fantastic plot. We know Earth has been re-done by the aliens(centuries have passed). We know the southern continents are viable but not the north. We know the aliens want humans to start with little more than clubs, knives, and fire. I was expecting a fusion of ceramics and plantlife and solar power. What the reader gets is mankind killing each other off in every chapter. We see the worst of the worst of our DNA. Huh?? I thought all our ""bad genes"" had been turned off in book one. I'm so glad I didn't buy anymore of this trilogy."
3,Warning: this is not a new novel,"Before you buy this book be very careful. The description is horrible for this book. It is not a new Octavia Butler novel but instead a collection of three of her novels. So if you already own ""Dawn,"" ""Adulthood Rites,"" and ""Imago"" do not order this book. I highly recommend the three novels -- they are wonderful examples of her work -- so if you do not already own them, this is a ""better buy"" if you really like Butler."
5,Excellent Readiing,Wonderful book to read. I liked the ending also. So many books leave you hanging or don't end well. This is not the case here!
2,Creepy,"Butler could not have chosen a more repulsive image than worms—my worst phobia—for her aliens' tentacles. <Shudder> While her writing is, as always, excellent, I find the premise of this story to be very distasteful. I know we humans are a self-destructive race, but I could not agree with the idea that another, parasitic, race should deprive us of our free will and that humans could submit so readily just because they gave us pleasurable feelings. Let us destroy ourselves and our planet if we want to, but leave us our freedom to choose. The only reason I kept reading to the end was my expectation that the humans would somehow gain the upper hand and find a way to get rid of the aliens.As always, Butler demonstrates tremendous imagination and originality in this series, but it's not my cup of tea."
5,Absolutely wonderful !,Octavia Butler is by far my favorite author. This compliation is the perfect place to start if you've never read any of her work. I can't recommend it highly enough. This is the kind of book you will read again and again.
2,"Incredible, but not my cup of tea","Book One is the best of the three. And even then, I just could not get a lot out of Octavia. I know who she is and had her on my list to read, felt this was a great purchase and gave her a whirl. I found books two and three growing more and more flat, and didn't even finish three."
5,a fascinating read,"a highly intelligent, inventive and thought provoking book, about Earth and the remnants of humanity after a nuclear holocaust rescued, more or less, by an alien race whom roam the universe looking for new worlds, species, flora and fauna to explore and exploit for genetic material before venturing across space again. neither group can possibly emerge unchanged. don't look for some sort of intergalatic war of the worlds, or humanity's triumph over adversity. the aliens have a highly developed moral system that appears amoral at best and antagonistic and exploitative to most of the remnants of humanity which would have ceased to exist without the aliens' intervention. the triology explores the interaction of both groups over decades and the inevitable evolution of both groups."
5,great for outdoor and indoor,"if you can't find it on sale anywhere else, this will suffice. This chalk is great"
3,Shallow Bay tracklisting:,"1. Great Spangled Fritillary2. Melonella3. Pale Cloud White4. Eggs and Their Shellsa good little ep. if you already like the Cocteau Twins, then you know what to expect. the music here falls more in the catagory of ""Treasure"" rather than ""Heaven or Las Vegas."""
5,Good Solution for Packable Travel Tray,"We picked this up for use with a car seat on a plane ride and it worked out great. I wasn't sure about the soft surface and my husband was concerned that it would be too big and encroach on others but it worked out fine. It was easy to strap across our son and his car seat (much easier than actually trying to get the carseat latched into the airplane seat). There are latches on both sides of the wrap-around strap so it is easy to attach no matter what side the car seat is on. The surface was able to hold our laptop to watch a movie. There was room on either side of the car seat to let the side flaps down and those would have been handy for his water bottle and toys, if it had been a longer flight. We were able to fold up the tray and stick it with the car seat into the car seat carrier we use to carry the carseat through the airport. We haven't used it in the car as yet, but it would have been very handy on a road trip last summer . . . :-)"
5,Great for Long Road Trip,"We bought this before we went on a road trip from Florida to NY with our 2.5 year old. It was perfect! She could color, eat snacks and play with her toys without them falling on the floor of the van."
2,Not impressed,I like the mesh pockets on the side but it is not as sturdy as it looks. I was hoping my daughter could draw on it...and she can but needs something hard to put under it. I won't be ordering this for my son
1,disappointed!,"This product is great in theory. Its safe and squishy during an accident,but unfortunately just isn't strong enough to hold anything. My son 3yrs couldn't color on it and everything rolled towards him. It was way too big for his lap.I am going to hang onto it in hopes of him being able to use it in a booster seat. Sadly I wouldn't recommendit at his age."
3,decent,"I bought this for a family road trip to Florida. It worked fairly well for my 4 y.o. It is nice and large, but a bit more flimsey than I expected. Overall, if it was less expensive, it would be worth buying. I believe that it is currently over-priced."
3,Great idea - doesn't work with all car seats,"I love the idea behind this tray. It is made of great materials (soft yet firm; not floppy) and if it had fit I think my son would have really enjoyed it. However, it didn't work with his car seat. Ours has slightly higher, curved sides, and so the tray (even when buckled around my son) couldn't get close enough. There was a gap of about 8 or 10 inches from his tummy to the beginning of the tray, which made it very difficult for him to play with anything on it. I had wanted to use it for toys and food, but the food was spilled into the 8 inch gap, and the toys slid to the back of the tray where he couldn't reach them. Disappointing! In any case, I'd recommend this tray as a great product, but you should definitely check your car seat's construction before buying one. I also would love to see a caution to this effect in their description, so what happened for us doesn't catch others by surprise."
4,Great for road trips,"I purchased one each for my 9 year old son and 5 year old daughter for road trips. I was worried they would not hold the weight of heavier items like laptops but they do. They work great for watching DVDs, iPads, playing on the laptop plus eating and coloring in. My kids love them."
1,"Not for bucket car seats, very badly designed.","I ordered this cars seat tray for a 10 day road trip. It is flimsy and has a crease that is sewn in for folding purposes right down the middle of the tray. Which makes the tray bend downward when used. This causes anything that you put on it to slide. However,this isn't the biggest problem, the worst part is it does not work on bucket car seats at all. They fail to mention this in the ad. It is really meant for older children with a graduated car seat. Even with this kind of seat it still has the crease which folds downward causing everything to slide. Very poor quality and craftsmanship as well. This one is better left at the store. Needs to be completely redesigned."
3,"Not sturdy, but convenient!","I bought this for an 11 hour road trip I took alone with a 2 year old. The roadtrip was a very bad idea, but the tray was brilliant. I wish it had been a little sturdier - my son wanted to race his cars on it, and it's so flimsy that they wouldn't drive anywhere.I LOVE that the tray has raised sides. It makes it so much more convenient for the grown ups, and so much harder for conniving children to drop their toys ""on accident."" The sides do store toys and books, but my son had a hard time getting through the elastic top to get the toys out. They would often get caught on the mesh sides.Ultimately we only used this a few times. Apart from the road trip, it wasn't very convenient to have in the car as it was just another step in getting the kid strapped in. It would be great for parents who travel a lot, or for kids who are into coloring or drawing in the car as it holds pretty still."
3,This product is ok.,"I was looking for a car seat tray for a long plane ride and subsequent car ride. I read many of the reviews and should have listened to the ones saying that the tray is soft and folds in the middle. It didn't fit well on our car seat and it would only stay level if I put a pillow underneath it. As the picture shows it has the edge only on 3 sides, so if my daughter kicked the tray anything on it fell into her lap. The harnessing strap is a good idea though. The Munchkin car tray I found at BabiesRUs works well for us. It has a built in snack trap, it has a rim all the way around it, and it is more firm than this one. The pricing is competitive."
3,"Its ok, but not great","Like many other reviewers here, my daughter does like to use this sometimes on long car trips. When she does, she is able to do some coloring.But like other reviewers, I wish it had a flatter, harder surface. I understand that for safety reasons it may not be possible, but I can always dream."
2,Not really all that functional...,"my toddler/preschool daughter hated using it as it just sat at an angle and slid everything into her lap. She didn't really like coloring on it because it's quite a small surface and her coloring book couldn't quite fit.My toddler son didn't mind it for playing with his cars on it, but he too got tired of it sitting too close to him and always cried and kicked at it to get it off. So we stopped buckling it for easy removal when they got tired of it. It was more of a nuisance to have to fix it and adjust it all the time.I like the idea of it and It could be that my kids just have issues with things on their laps, but I ended up donating it."
1,Strong chemical smell...don't bother,This seemed like a really cute product but it has a really strong chemical plastic smell to it. Not a great idea to have in a car right in front of a baby. It didn't even get that far in my house. We sent it back. I'm sure there is something less toxic out there for baby.
2,Flimsy,This lasted about 10 minutes on my 2 yr olds lap. It was big and flimsy. She didn't care for it at all and it was more of a hassle than anything.
2,"Great concept, poor design :(","I was so excited to get this for our busy three year old for a long ride to vacation. She was very excited to use it too, but after attaching it (multiple times) even when it appeared to be secure it only took a few minutes for it to start sliding forward which meant that either crayons or playsets were also sliding forward/falling off."
4,recommended,"We got this for our 1 year old for road trips. He is great in the car but he loses his toys and treats frequently and I have to try to locate them twisting around from the front seat. This gives him a surface to play on and the mesh compartments on the sides work great to keep treats, sippy cups and extra toys. It is also very easy to adjust and attach/install. The material wipes up easily too. We keep this in the trunk of our car and it folds nice and flat, not taking up much room. My only slight complaint is that the blue tray surface is not hard, although it is stiff. It may not be ideal for coloring on, etc. I think this was probably intended so it would be easier fold up for storage but I would rather have had a harder surface. All in all, this is a great item to have around and I definitely recommend it. FYI - we have a very wide car seat and this fits it fine. Should work for any size seat."
5,Great Product!,"We have the Cosco Alpha Omega Elite car seat, and this tray fits great! Good deal for the money. The only thing I would like to change about this is to add a little lip on the edge that sits up to the child as sometimes the food/activity slides down into the bottom of the seat. I'm also planning on using this in my stroller but haven't had the chance yet..."
3,Too soft for us,"I wanted something for the car seats so the children could play, eat and draw. I love the design but they were just too soft. They didn't stay put very well while strapped on.I ended up sending mine back for a refund without any problems."
3,"May work for older children, not great for my 2 y/o","I ended up returning this item because we didn't use it on a recent 8-12 hour roadtrip.Note that many commented you have to pull over to unbuckle the strap when your child is done using-we didn't realize until after our trip that there are buckles on both sides. That means you can leave the strap behind the child and just clip on/off both sides without pulling over to remove the whole tray.My child was not able to keep the tray flat enough to use to draw, this should work better for an older child."
4,Kids Snack Tray,"I purchased two trays for my grandchildren who are travelers. They travel to our home and it can be 2 or 6 hour ride since both our children live in two separate states. The tray was great for one of our grandsons who rode to our home for 6 hours, he watched a DVD, was able to play a game and ate his lunch as well. The only downside is the way you have to set it up to sit right on the car seat. If it is not set up around the child it will not open correctly. So if you do it right then you will have to go through a little bit to take them out should you stop at all on the ride. But over all the tray was great for us."
4,it seems work but they can be improved,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter. It seems working well. However, it is little too soft so that front of this table tilt and it seems hard for her to use. I feel Ok about it since if it is too hard then the time of accident probably will not good. But if you are looking for something that this table is hard surface to writ noble then it is not for you.One thing I feel needs to be improvedkid cannot take it out by themselves when they finish using them since the buckle goes around the back. I thought it may work just going around the kid, but it was too long. So when she did not want the table and if we were driving it is not a good situation.Other than that it was ok."
4,Very handy tray,USed on long trips with the two little ones. Great for keeping them entertained with their toys close at hand. Was also very useful for meals on the go.
1,Pretty useless,"This isn't a tray, its a semi-soft tray-shaped piece of vinyl covered material that doesn't do what it is supposed to do and is way more trouble than it is worth to attempt to use.Don't bother.Returned."
4,Not the best but it works and is safe!,"We got this product for our 1 year old becasue we take alot of long car trips, i went back and forth between this and the hard plastic version and chose this for the saftey rated crash test...it is soft and would just crumble down, where as the hard plastic trays would cause injury. The mesh pockets are nice on the sides and the try is pretty good over all, but it does not sit flat and the items slid back toward the child and fall down through the cracks if they are small..."
4,great purchase,"I've decided that if I never use this item again it was well worth the money. My boys are a little older I think than the average user at 4 & 6 almost 5& 7 and they loved having everything at their fingertips. Both Boys being into cars it made a very good highway and racetrack. Coloring was great , crayons stayed in the tray and easy to get when in one of the four pockets. We did not have the number of dropped, crayons, cars, foods as we did in previous trips which makes it that much more enjoyable for mom. It is very easy to adjust and install . Just put strap around the back of a child strapped into their car-seat. They are soft and flexible so they had no problems falling asleep with this on their laps in fact it was great at holding the additional stuffed animals they just had to have. In all was well worth the money, for snack or play it definitely met all of my expectations."
3,Star kids snack tray,The tray is great but hard to get in and out of the car easily. It's good if you are traveling a long way but be prepared at rest stops that it takes time to put back in place
4,great idea for kids,My kids fight over who gets to have this in the car/stroller. We had to order a 2nd one. Perfect for parents on the run who need to feed kids in the car. fits under the stroller when we collapse it. only thing is getting the strap behind the car seat.
2,flimsy,"the picture shows the tray ""flat"" it will NEVER be smooth or flatno coloring or writing will happen with this trayany snacks will roll aroundAND the picture of the girl in the pink shirt with this over her lap is grossly misleading, it suggests there is enough stiffness in the sides to have this stand over her lap, the sides are FLAPS of material - nylon sheeting with no stiffness what so everstill debating but am probably returning this."
1,annoying,this is junk. it's a pain to take off and on we used it once before my daughter pulled it off and threw it on the floor. waste of money.
3,"Good, but somewhat flimsy...","This tray was helpful on a long road trip, but it was a little flimsy for heavier items."
4,Works very well,"I bought two of these for my almost three year old daughter and my five year old son. While these trays are flexible, they still made great surfaces for Legos, coloring books, and Littlest Pet Shop sets. The flexibility actually makes it easier to store the trays."
3,VanMom,This is a good product for older kids. I tried to use it with my 15 month old and it didn't work. I think I'll try it again when she's 2. The tray comes folded in half in a plastic package. I found it a little difficult to flatten out so there isn't a big hump in the middle.
3,"It worked, wished it could have been better","The strap componant has a clip on each side so if your car has the room to unclip one side and sort of flip it out of the way then that would work great. Our carseat is next to the door on the passenger side and my mom sitting next to the car seat could easily reach to unclip the one close to her but then trying to shove it out of the way between the door and carseat didn't work so well. We used this on a 16 hour drive for our 2.5 year-old and when it was in position she could color nicely. It was too flimsy to do much else on, I wouldn't try and serve snacks on it for instance because of the slope. Also our daughter seemed to feel hemmed in when this was in place because it covered so much of her and because the strap has to loop behind her we had to stop the car to take it on and off. For the return trip we didn't use it all. Perhaps when she's older and can manipulate it herself this will be more handy."
3,Not as firm as I had hoped,I have an orbit car seat and it does not fit well around it. The tray is not as firm as I would have preferred it to be. It is a great concept but I'm not real happy with it.
2,"Ok, but could be better.","I purchased this tray thinking it would be a good product to use on long car trips to visit family. However, it doesn't really attach firmly to our carseat, making it a bit wobbly and unsecure. It is also very large. I can see where it would be a good product for an older child (10 years +) to use on their lap while drawing, coloring, or snacking. I just wouldn't purchase it again for a small child."
3,Overpriced and rendered useless,"I was really excited about this tray, until I put it in action. It lays on my son's legs and he fusses and tries to push it off -- he fights with it until I eventually give up and take it off. I would send it back, but it's too much of a hassle. It's now laying around collecting dust, and I'm hoping to try again when my son is older so I get my money's worth. To be honest, it is way overpriced! I'd pay no more than $10 for it if I could! Totally useless! Oh well, you live and learn."
3,Decent,"Have really used this product. My daughter used it when she was younger, around a year old. It folds in and doesn't really hold stuff up so she can get to it."
1,not as sturdy as I thought,I ordered this to take on a plane for my 2 year old because I thought her car seat would make the flip down plane tray not usable. I didn't even open the package until we got on the plane and was surprised to find it is not stiff/sturdy like it looks in the picture. I tried putting a sweater and pillows on her lap to keep the tray level and all of that stuff just drove her crazy and the ridge of the tray farthest from her was still tilting down to the ground. I also couldn't tighten the strap enough so that it was tight against her body. we couldn't use it and the plane tray did reach her just fine.I had to return it when I got home because we weren't able to use it all.
3,Too wide and soft,"The tray is significantly wider than the car seat so it flops to one side or the other unless I tighten up the straps so the corners pull into the side of the car seat. But then the tray sort of buckles in my daughter's lap, creating a hill for her toys to fall down. My daughter finds it annoying and doesn't want to use it. Nice idea, but needs improvement."
3,"Liked by my 4 year old, disliked by my 2 year old","As far as travel trays go, this one is decent. Deep, easy access pockets on the sides to hold snacks, drinks, small toys, crayons, small books, etc. The tray has 3 sides to keep items like crayons and small toys from rolling off the sides or front. My 4 year old liked it for drawing in the car and eating her snacks on a long road trip. My 2 year old did not like it at all. Guess it just depends on your children. :-)"
4,My 2 year old loves this.,This saved my sanity on a recent long road trip. We love the side pockets and so did our little guy. Us parents love that its soft and safe (just thinking about what a hard wooden or plastic tray would do in a crash is scary). I would and do recommend this tray to all parents.
3,not sturdy!,I unfortunately got to use this product once for about 30 min bc my daughter hated it. The only thing i would say negative about it is that it is flimsy and the top is uneven so it was too hard for my daughter to do activities. I do not reccomend this product!
4,not too shabby,this product is not too bad. was hoping for something a bit sturdier but I understand the safety issues in case of a crash. it is a good table that works when travelling.
3,Not as good as advertised,Tray is flimsy since it comes folded over and packed tightly in a plastic packaging. It did not fully fit over my son's car seat but that was not a major issue. The issue there was that the one holder on that side kinda didn't hang properly. My son watched his DVD on the tray and the DVD kept sliding away from him since the tray was not strong. He kept having to pull it back towards him thus touching the screen many times leaving finger prints all over it. Very frustrating to have to watch him keep doing this. I am going to return this and buy the solid tray to see the difference.The noe good thing was that you could just unclip the tray and remove it quickly since it was flimsy and could stuff it away.
5,"Great for long trips and short ones, too","We bought this for a long drive (California to Montana) and it was great for keeping our 2-year-old entertained. He could play with his toys on it, draw, eat, etc. Even on shorter trips, it's great. It's soft so it won't injure your child if you'd get into an accident, but it's still sturdy enough. Love it!"
3,9 day Road Trip,"The travel tray was ok. Unfortunately, it ships bent in half and you can never really get the crease out so everything will fall to the center. I would have likes a more sturdy writing surface. The raised sides do help for keeping items contained. My daughter wasn't overly excited about it but I am glad we had it along."
4,"Soft enough to be safe, sturdy enough to work","Bought this for use with car seat for a long road trip. It worked well for holding some small toys, a book and a snack cup -- and a sippy cup in the pocket. The only bad part is that, an hour into the trip, my 2-year-old wanted the tray ""off, Off, OFF!"" So, I had to pull over to unstrap it. I think it will work better for shorter trips for my child -- but the tray, itself, works pretty well."
5,Wonderful!,"I bought this for my two-year-old when we were about to embark on a 1500 mile road trip for a family wedding. I was nervous to say the least! I fully believe that this tray helped our trip be a success! It is soft sided, so it was comfortable when he fell asleep against it. It kept his toys/snacks/sippy cups within reach and when it became wet from a spill it dried quickly. I don't think we would have survived without it!"
4,Snack and Play Tray,"What a life save this product was during travel and in the car seat. I wish the lip went all the way around and it was a little sturdier. But my son can color, play cars and eat w/out any problem. We used with the sit and stroll for flights and his cosco booster in the car"
5,Travel,This was a great purchase for a recent trip we went on. It was easy to store in the car when not in use. Worked great in use.
4,Pretty good,"I got these for my 16 month old and my just-turned-3 year old because we were going to be making two long road trips this summer. The first trip we took was two days - about 8 hours each day. My 3yo loved it, but my 16mo hated it. My 3yo used it for coloring, playing with trains, and loved putting his sippy cup in the side pockets. My 16mo wouldn't even let me put it on.The trays are soft foam, and at first I was worried that they wouldn't be hard enough to hold shape, but that was fine. I like that they are light weight and can be removed and tossed to the back easily when not in use. The can even be folded up pretty small and stored in the back of the van, which is something the hard plastic trays won't do.My only concern with this tray is that it won't hold up long term. I guess it doesn't need to last forever, but it would be nice if it still held its shape a couple of years from now. We'll see.I'd say it's definitely worth the money, especially if you're going on long road trips."
1,Too flimsy for me,"Obviously many others really like this product but I just didn't like it. It is flimsy and is not represented well by the stock photograph. I'd like to post a photo but I can't show how soft it is because I would have to set it on something which makes it look rigid. Basically, I was expecting something that my daughter could color on and set her juice on. As flimsy as this is there is no was this is possible."
1,Didn't like this item,"This tray was hard to use, it has to be strapped around the child while sitting in the seat. My son didn't like the belt around him and the tray never really went flat."
3,bulky,big and bulky and doesn't fit securely.Sits on babies legs and she gets annoyed and tries to kick it off.
2,Not worth the $,I had high hopes for this item. My boys are ages 3 and 4so they love to play with toys on the car which inevitablymeans they fall to the ground. This tray however does not stay up. My sons have to keep their legs lifted to keep it level.
3,Travel Tray - good but not great,"I purchased two of the travel trays for a long car trip for my daughters - ages 4 and 2 1/2. I was a bit worried that the trays would not work based on some of the other reviews but did not have a better option. The trays worked okay but my daughters were not very excited about having them on. We were traveling during the summer and the major complaint from my kids was that their legs got hot and sweaty. I agree with previous reviews in that the trays tilt toward the child so crayons, pens, etc would roll down into their laps. In addition, the trays are very soft so I had to take cookie sheets to put on the trays so they could color. I will be keeping them but will modify them next time so they work a little better."
4,good item for long road trip,I know some parents thought this item didn't fit snugly enough up against their children but I think it still worked well for my kids. Yeah things slide towards your kid and get lost in their car seat from time to time....but my kids were able to color and eat on it and put stuff in the pockets. It's super easy to wipe clean and folds up when they don't need to use it. It didn't fit over the arm rests of my kids graco car seats...but it did fit below the arm rests between the arm rests and the lower portion of their car seat.
3,Pretty decent,"Bought this for a long car ride for my 14 month old daughter. She liked being able to access all her toys/snacks on this tray but after awhile she just wanted to rip it away from her. Its pretty sturdy and easy to fit around the car seat. I would recommend it, especially for the price you can't go wrong."
3,"Good product, but not as sturdy as I expected","Tne tray is a great buy as it keeps my son's toys from falling on the floor. It is not very sturdy though. I have to give him a whole pad of paper so he won't put holes in it when he tries to color. And I saw one picture with a sippy cup sitting in the corner.... That will not work at all!! Maybe if your car is sitting still, and your child doesn't move at all, it might work then, but I doubt it.I am still mostly glad that I purchaced it though."
4,Nice Surprise,When we first received the snack tray I had reservations. Then we used it and it worked out great. The pockets on the sides are great for everything from drink cups to crayons and superheros. We are please we purchased this tray.
1,Did not care for this one at all,"I am very sorry - when I purchased this it seemed like a great idea, but it did not work out for me and my son at all. The tray actually tilts while in use which means that all of the toys, crayons, etc, end up in the car seat and not on the tray - everything falls off the tray (it tilts towards the child). Also, tray is not rigid enough - so it kind of sits on my child's legs and irritates him - so he tries to kick it off - also does not work very well.All and all, not as good of a design as I was hoping were and therefore it does not serve the purpose at all."
4,For those of you who think the tray is too soft....,"I thought so too, but ordered the High Road XL car organizer with the solid-core lid in the same shipment. It fits within the tray perfectly!"
3,"Nice idea, but grandaughter did not like it.","I thought this was a great idea and purchased it for a round-trip flight from Washington DC to California and back with 3 year-old grandaughter and her car seat. It lasted about 15 minutes on the airplane and she wanted it OFF!. Could not get her to try it again.The tray is soft (good if in an accident), but would not stay level for her to play on. Surface not strong enough to use for coloring or writing (or doing a puzzle). Items would not stay put where she wanted them to stay. It ended up being just one more thing to carry on and off the airplane.I can imagine putting Cheerios or other small food items on it for a small child and keeping them happy for a long time."
2,Not very useful,It is ok but it isn't very useful and it takes a bit of work to put it on the seat everytime you use it. I am worried that she will get car sick if she uses it on long trips and I am a little worried about the safety with it attached on her if she was in a accident. I guess it is better than something hard being in front of her but I doubt it has been tested to be safe or not. It is flimsy too. I don't think it will hold up for long and find that it just ends up on the floor being trampled on.
3,Not much in use,My baby is 14 months and she doesn't use as much. I tought about returning it but I decided to wait till she gets little older. attaching it to her seat was easy. Tray is flexible.
1,Very cheap quality.Not worth the postage to send it back,Star Kids Snack and Travel Tray. What a terrible piece of equipment.It is nothing like advertised. Limp and flimsy and doesn't hold anything in front of your child. Don't waste your money.
4,Excited to Use!,"Ordered 3 of these for an upcoming vacation. We have 2 yr old twins and a 6 yr old and I was looking for something to allow them their own space... to eat, draw, read, play with toys etc. without having to mess with creating a make-shift tray space. Easy to attach and from our test run, they appear to be a perfect fit to what we were looking for. The true test will be the 23 hr car ride!"
4,Our daughter loves this tray!,"Our daughter is 2 years old and loves this tray. It is soft and so safe for use in the car. The tray holds her toys, books, and snacks enabling her to play more easily on her own. She stays busy for longer periods of time and this make road trips much easier for us. Our daughter also found that it is a fun item to play peek-a-boo with. The tray is easy to set up and take down. The only thing that doesn't seem to work well are the side pockets. Perhaps it is because our daughter is so young, but she is unable to put items in or take items out of the side pockets on her own."
4,snack tray,"I was so glad to get this. Our daughter gets so bored in the car and constantly drops things and I have to reach back to give it back to her (as long as I'm in the passenger's seat). This is a great idea and I love it. She was a bit unsure of it at first and still, sometimes, doesn't like anything in front of her. It's the best, saftest, thing of it's kind on the market."
4,Love it.,I was looking for something to help keep my daughter occupied during a long driving trip. This travel tray fits the bill. The high edge keeps her crayons and other things from rolling onto the floor. The softness of the tray makes it comfortable too. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Perfect for travel,"My wife and I purhased two of these days before our family vacation. Our boys, 3 years old and 14 months, were very excited to have a tray surface in front of them. Their toys and snacks were all in arms reach. These were very easy to install and clean."
3,not a bad little gadget,"I saw an ad for this in a magazine and thought about getting one, but had pretty much decided against it after reading the reviews. My three-year-old son saw the photo, though, and demanded it (even after I explained that it didn't come with the cars that the little boy in the ad was using). Well, I figured ""what the heck"" and ordered it. You know, I really don't have a problem with it. I'm sure my expectations were more reasonable after reading the reviews. My son loves it, but pretty much all it's good for is driving cars around. We tried using it for a snack in the car, but it's just not sturdy enough--everything ended up spilling. But, for a place to keep toys (and to keep them from falling all over the floor), it's a handy little tool. I'm not sad that I bought it."
5,Fabulous addition to any road trip with a toddler!,"I really love this. Having embarked on a number of long car trips with my toddler, this really is a godsend. No longer does my daughter have to balance her sandwich on her lap - making a mess in the process - but she also has an adequate surface on which to put her colouring book and pens etc. There are also useful pockets on each side for drinks etc. I would totally recommend this if you do a lot of long car journeys :-)"
5,A great assortment,This is a wonderful CD for anyone desiring a sample of some of the great Cuban music.
4,Ever wanted to walk in someone else's shoes?,"This novel is another delight from Mrs. Green! Swapping Lives explores the lives of two women who live in completely different worlds. The first woman, Vicky, is a single features editor at a British magazine. The other woman, Amber, is a wealthy Conneticut socialite with a husband and two children. Both women are going through a rut in their lives and wonder what it would be like if (for Vicky) she had a husband and kids and (for Amber) if she was suddenly single again, would their lives be more fulfilling? In order to find out they swap lives for a month in an experiment to see if they'd truly be happier in another woman's shoes. As expected there are some predictable, chick lit elements to this book. But, overall the novel is entertaining and you will find yourself rooting for both heroines as they discover that the grass isn't always greener on the other side."
3,Not my favorite Green book,"I love Jane Green and have read most of her novels. When I saw this one sitting on the book store shelf, I snatched it right up and dug right in. I did not enjoy this one like I did with her other novels. It seemed to be filled with a lot of fluff. Nothing substanial like the other novels. I just couldn't get into it and one of the man characters reminded me too much of the main character in Bergdorf Blondes. It wasn't as good as I hoped, coming from Jane Green - but it wasn't too terrible. Try Jane Green's other novels (Mr. Maybe; Jemina J; Bookends) for a much better read or Emily Giffin."
1,Rubish,"I read beach house and enjoyed it as a summer read. So, I grabbed swapping lives, thought the jacket description sounded interesting. Sadly, it was the only well written, readable part of the book. Where the heck was her editor??? There was so much droning on and on and repetitive writing describing the two main characters. I think deep down, there was a good idea for a story but sadly, execution was lacking and sloppy. Anyway, I couldn't enjoy it because I kept wanting to edit it. (BTW, I'm not an editor, just your average stay home mom who enjoys reading A LOT!) Best of luck. I haven't given up on her yet, however, if the next one is this much of a stinker, I'm moving on!"
3,Fun to read.,"A good chick lit book. Entertaining, but not ground breaking. No original or new ideas. Just fun observations about suburban Connecticut and London."
3,Interesting topic but the book needed more substance,"Jane Green is one of my favorite authors, but she spent too much of the book describing the characters lives before they switch places (the swap didn't occur for over 200 pages in the book which is more than halfway!). The lives of the women are interesting yet the time in which they swap needed more substance, more detail. I felt like as soon as they swapped, Green shared a few stories and then they switched back quickly."
4,I'll Have What She's Having,"Is the grass greener on the other side? Or in this case, is her life better than mine? A successful single gal temporarily swaps lives with a rich, routine-oriented mom. The result? Our lives and our choices are the right ones for us! For the real-life version of this theme, read, ""I'll Have What She's Having""!"
4,Stellar chick lit,"OK, it's not great literature, but the story is well done and engrossing, after a somewhat slow start. But what I really want to add here is that the reader of the audiobook version is amazing. She doesn't merely read, but acts the story, with a wide array of voices and accents: Brits, Americans, Irish, men, women, and even small children! This talented reader added much to the story, and made me look forward to long car rides so I could get lost in the experience."
2,"Jane Green, the Queen of Predictable","This book is so predictable and boring that I couldn't read past Vicky's first trip to America to meet Amber. I didn't even get to the swap. And, that was already more than halfway through the book! I couldn't find myself liking either of the main characters at all.Vicky over-romanticized everything so much it made you sick, and Amber was living such an exaggerated, spoiled life, it was surreal.This book was so overwritten and dragged on horribly! Save yourself time and read a book with some substance. Leave this one in the store."
1,"Dull, dull, dull","Reading this book was similar to chewing cardboard with an extra helping of sand on the side - dull, uninteresting, headache inducing and excruciatingly boring! It seems the author had developed an incontinence of words, therefore making the book over 400 pages long of continues loops of repeated conversations and thoughts. A story as inane as this does not deserve so much time and effort - lets not confuse ourselves with Tolstoy and Dostoyevskiy, shall we, Jane Green? And humor? WHAT HUMOR?"
4,An interesting and enjoyable story.,"I've always enjoyed Jane Green's books and ""Swapping Lives"" is no exception. The story was interesting, but not a surprise since the subject of swapping something, homes, mates, work, etc has been around for awhile. The characters in the story were believable, especially Vicky and Amber. I read the book over a two day period, so for me it was a fast read, but an enjoyable read. I won't say it was one of Jane Green best, but it was still a wonderful read."
5,Jane Green never disappoints me,"I have been an avid reader since I was 5 years old-no lie. And there are very few authors who have captivated my interest so much that I want to read all of their literature. Jane Green is one of these few authors, and having read most of her books, I can say that Swapping Lives is no exception. An excellent piece of work, well written and a definite page-turner. I am so glad that there is a Jane Green in the world, because otherwise, I wouldn't have much to read!"
2,Disappointed Jane Green fan...,"I am a huge Jane Green fan and was very disappointed with this novel. The story had interesting possibilities, but also left a bitter taste in my mouth. The thing I found the most disturbing is that every man in the book was a remarkable cad...even Amber's ""devoted"" husband. Call me naive, but not every man that is attracted to another woman other than his wife is going to act on that attraction. Also, the story seemed to drag and then ended abruptly. Doesn't even compare with The Other Woman."
1,Sorely disappointed,"I'm a huge Jane Green fan, but I must say I am disappointed with her latest effort. The writing style almost drove me insane - every time I read a paragraph beginning with ""For"", I wanted to scream! I barely made it through the book, and only forced myself to finish as I kept hoping that it would take a turn for the better. I loved all her earlier books, but would definitely recommend you pass on this one."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","This sounded like a fun, easy, ""chick-lit"" type read. I thought it was awful. It took FOREVER for anything to happen and then even longer for the main characters to actually ""swap lives."" Once they did I thought things might get more interesting, but once again, nothing really interesting happened. Really wish I could get my money back on this one."
3,couldn't get into it,"I love to sort of lose myself in a novel, and I couldn't. Jane Green tells this story in the third person- as an uninterested observer. And that's how it felt- I couldn't get interested in the characters. It wasn't bad- I finished it, but it certainly didn't keep me up an night reading it."
3,Likeable characters - but too detailed,"I was SO excited to get this book with all the A+ reviews I read online. The characters were likeable, easy to relate to, funny at times... the downside for me was TOO many unnecassary details that really dragged out the first half. I kept reading as I was anxious to get to the swap, but was disappointed that didn't even take place until 2/3 through the book. Then when it happened it was like they ran out of time and cut it short. This is the part I wanted to read details about! I don't blame Jane Green and will continue to read her novels, it must have been the editor on this one."
2,Quite disappointing,"Don't bother reading this book. I stopped reading at around page 60. It's simply lame.Also, there are so many characters that you have a hard time keeping up with all the names.Really not worth your time. Find something better to read (like Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic books ...those are actually funny and much better written than this Jane Green book)."
1,First Time I've ever reurned a book,"This book went in circles, never completely finished story lines.This is the first time I've ever asked for my money back after reading a book. I thought it was terrible. I swore off ever reading anything ever written by this author, BUT after reading the other reviews I decided to give her earlier writings a try."
4,Fun Beach Read,"This book reminded me a lot of the Cameron Diaz/Kate Winslet movie, The Holiday. Very cute. It was the perfect book to take on vacation!"
4,Put it on your summer break list,"This fun theme, swapping lives with someone else, is done with wit and imagination in Ms. Green's book. A fun story, you won't want to set this one down in fear you will miss something! Take the kids to the pool and read this in your chaise lounge."
3,fun read,"This wasn't Jane Green's best novel, although it is a fun read. She did a great job keeping the reader's attention and writing with strong detail. The story line is creative and the message is nice."
1,This book is lame.,"The whole time while reading this book I wondered what it constitutes to call something out for plagiarism? The TV show ""Wife swap"" runs for several years now, so the whole exchanging lives idea was nothing new.From ABC's website:Wife Swap is ABC's most-watched series in the time period in four years, and its highest-rated among Adults 18-49 in eight years - since the 2001-02 and 1997-98 seasons, respectively.Aside from all that the book was still halfway enjoyable to read until it comes out that Amber's husband Richard had lost his job 6 months ago, and she happily moves with him to some sort of Apple farm to stat over their life - then it just got too unrealistic and plain lame..."
3,Mediocre at Best,"As a Jane Green fan, I was disappointed. Her writing is usually much more entertaining and in depth. As someone wanting an easy nighttime read, I was pleased with this novel. Predictable and mindless, this is one that did not keep me reading late into the night.In this novel, we meet Vicky, a successful magazine editor who dreams of life as a wife and mum. We also meet Amber, a scrappy suburban socialite who thinks that there just might be ""more to life than this."" Since the show ""Wife Swap"" has been on television for several seasons now, this idea is old news. Of course Vicky and Amber are going to miss their old lives. Of course they will see what they have previously taken for granted. Of course they will want to go home and live their lives anew. Yawn. I was really hoping for a twist.If you want to read some GOOD Jane Green, stick to her earlier works. If you want something to ease your mind as you drift into slumber, then Swapping Lives will do the trick."
4,I thought it was a great book!,"Some of the previous reviews were kind of mean I thought. But that is why they are reviews and everyone has thier own opinions. :)I rather enjoyed this book, although it wasn't a difficult read, it did keep my attention and several times during the day I would think about the book and want to finish it. I would recommend it, I like to read chick lit every once in a while along with my dose of deeper fiction and non-fiction."
3,Predictable copycat,"Amber Winslow is a mother of two and devoted wife to Richard, a broker on Wall Street. They have their dream house in Highfield, Connecticut. Amber competes with many of the women in her neighborhood to be the best-dressed at social functions. She is delighted when she is the first in town to get the current ""in"" designers to re-do her living room. Meanwhile, in London, Vicky Townsley, 35 years old and single is a successful career woman being the features director at Poise! magazine. Vicky longs to know what it feels like to be married. Amber longs to find out what is wrong with her seemingly perfect life. Vicky chooses Amber as part of a Poise! contest to swap lives with her for a month. At first they are both enthralled by the idea but by the end of two weeks they can't wait to switch back. Overall, this novel felt rushed, sloppy, and predictable."
3,Disappointing too,I expected more from Jane Green. I've read all her books and this is my least favorite.
2,Ehh....,"I brought this book with a lot of anticipation, I loved Mr. Maybe, Straight Talking, The Other Woman, and Babyville the rest of Ms. Green's novels have fallen into the Ehh category, unfortunately, this one falls into that category. I just couldnt' get behind her lead characters, Vicky is nice but a bit of a naive dimwit when it comes to life and Amber is insecure and materialistic. Is being top dog so important that you do something that you absolutely hate just to show people that you can? Sorry, both of these chicks are to self-centered to garner much sympathy."
2,A swing...and a miss,"I've been a big fan of Green for quite some time. Both this book and the previous (the other woman) were big disappointments. This book really could have been a short story in a magazine (about 3 pages) yet it goes on & on & on and never really gets anywhere. The book is very predictible, not funny, and a bit of a bore. Leave this one on the shelf & buy Baby Proof by Emily Giffin instead."
3,Decent but not quite good,"jane green is one of my favorite authors out there and i am always eager for her newest book. this one, while decent, was not up to the level of her earlier books, bookends and jemima j in particular. its really light and an interesting story but just not something that i could really get into. and when it was over, instead of missing the characters like i have in her other books, i just didnt really care.over all, i thought that this was a decent read, certainly not bad. but it was forgettable and i never say that about her books. i agree with the reviewer below who says that it would be better to stick to her other books or check out authors like emily giffin and marian keyes, who each have great books out this year."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"I'm disappointed in the quality of the publication. The cover is beautiful, and there are 7 glossy pages of color photos toward the back. The rest is printed on paper similar to the paper I use in my inkjet printer. Illustrations are black and white line drawings, which I find difficult to follow. The cover and the $30 price led me to expect a professionally published book."
5,Wonderful book to get your creative juices flowing,I love this book.If you need patterns to copy this most likely is not the book for you. If you use books to give you ideas for a new project this book will be a gold mine. The use of beads in combination with embroidery stitches is clearly demonstrated in sketches. There are suggestions for variations. Hope she writes another book including more stitches and ideas.
1,Very disappointed,"I'm very disappointed in this book. When the mail came, I was excited. That soon changed. I have a couple of other bead embroidery books and was told that this was a great book. The price is high, the cover is beautiful and there are 7 glossy pages of color photos toward the back. Other than that, the rest is cheaply made. Illustrations are black and white line drawings and the work is simply regular embroidery stitches with beads, nothing new. The cover and the price made me believe I would learn something or get ideas. Wrong."
3,"Love Bead Embroidery, but not this book",I guess I create a completely different kind of bead embroidery than the author. It just wasn't my favorite way of getting a point across. I sold this book to a co-beader not long after I bought it.
1,Has to contain some ppd,"I tried this product because I have used colora henna powder and I thought that I would get the same results. Well I did not, I had a mild reaction. It was not like the allergic reactions I have had in the past with facial swelling and blisters but there was definitely a burning sensation and slight redness. It was only relieved after I used cortisone cream. And to make things worse, it did not color my hair. I would not buy the creme version if you have allergies."
1,Looks good but painful to wear,This shoe is beautiful but is NOT designed for walking will cause excruciating pain since the material is not flexible at all and contains some metal material near to the toes. I now only use it for activities where there is minimal walking involved. I would advise not to buy or purchase a half size bigger than your usual size. For wide feet do not purchase at all!!!!!
3,More Information Please!,"Julius Caesar was master of the Roman world, but this video falls somewhat short in bringing that fact to light. It is a decent production, and it does document his rise to political power, but his career was so fascinating that a program which is less than an hour in length hardly begins to cover all the bases. Caesar is unquestionably one of the biggest and boldest figures in history - this video needs to be at least twice as long, and maybe more, to give the subject a thorough review."
3,A battle begun but not won,"This video on the life of Julius Caesar is light information for the buyer that wants to know basic facts spiced with historiccally biased but interesting semi-facts.Anyway, I don't want to sound too critical I did enjoy the video though it failed to capture the true greatness of Caesar. One should not expect dsicussions on battles in ancient history nor on the policy of Clemens the shortage of food in the civil war aera but fora light overwiew that granted does not do the great man justice one couls certainly buy this as well as the one's on Trajan,Hadrian,Constantine and so on., so ""Ambition should be made of sterner stuff"", but ok."
1,Never again,"A friend showed me the 510, I was very impressed, I orded on, in a few monthe the volume started going down, the volume got lower and lower. I called my friend, he told me he stopped using his 510 because the battery died and there was no replacement. 2 weeks ago I emailed company asking for an address to send my 510 in for repair. No response, I am finished with the outfit."
5,The Best Company to Order From,"The product I recieved was defected, but the company contacted me as soon as possible. They refunded my money and agreed to fix the problem. They were fast and reliable. I would order from them again."
1,Beware of recommended use dates for this product!,"Note: I haven't yet used this product, so I can't rate its performance. This is a comment on Amazon selling old stock of this product.I just ordered this kit for use on my Spyder fleece skiwear because Nikwak is recommended by Spyder. When it arrived I was amazed to read on the package ""Made in the UK 02/06. Best used within 4 years."" The product is more than three years into the manufacturer's four year recommended use period! I just bought my Spyder skiwear at end-of-season sales but thought I would buy this product now to have it on hand for next year. I don't even anticipating using it until March or April 2010. It will be past its recommended use period by then! The other kit that I ordered was made 08/08, which is reasonable."
5,My Granddaughter the waitress,"I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter. She loves to play waitress ALL the time. Everyone has to place their orders before each meal at home. Needless to say, she loved it! As for me, I am happy that children still have an imagination in todays world of gadgets."
2,Not the best,If a deal seems too good to be true...probably is. One was DOA and others are weak. Won't go this way next time I need batteries.
3,Batteries,"They arrived promptly, and in good condition. I put them in the fridge. What more can I say, I have not tried them?"
4,Gave it as a present,"I gave it as a present to my girlfriend, and sh loved it... it's useful at all times and different situations!"
2,Durability Issues,"Lasted for almost 1 year before one of the sides fell off. Nice pattern and good tool. It was used on a keyring, so it saw daily handling and banging around in a purse. I still would expect this to last longer than it did. If the durability is going to be this low, than I think a sub-ten-dollar price is in order."
5,I have all the colors!!,"Couldn't make up my mind which color I liked best!! These knifes are so handy and the scissors are fantastic, if tiny. I have one in every purse so as to be never without one. What a bargain they are...my first pair came from a local store and I paid $25 !! I found my next one on Amazon and have been buying them since. They make a great gift for girlfriends .....everyone I give them to loves them..."
3,Util.. pero hasta alli,"Una pieza util, pero sumamente pequeña y sencilla... en comparación con las demas piezas.. el factor costo/utilidad no es muy relevante."
5,practical and pretty,I think these simple little swiss army knives have been invaluable to me over the years. I can attach them to key chains the most and use them all the time. I like this print of flowers and the blue color gives it a nice femmy sort of look. I like that. I recommend to anyone.
5,My girlfriend loves it... Keeps it on her keychain.,My girlfriend loves it... Keeps it on her keychain.She keeps it on her 20-some key ring with her carabiner and her mini pepper spray.
5,Awesome!,"I don't like leaving a bunch of 5-star reviews all at once... but I have no complaints about this handy pocket knife! :) It's got an attractive design and does all the things I need it too. It's a Victorinox, so quality isn't even an issue. I do wish it had a LED light on it, but that's my fault for picking the cute flower design form over function! ;)"
5,Handy gift,"I wanted to get something unusual as an extra gift for one of my closest female friends and I saw this. (We spent four-years in art school together and we know how useful it is to carry a little pocket knife for projects that pop up.) It was just like the traditional knife she always carried, but it was in one of her favorite colors: lime green. She loved the color and pattern and I was happy to give her something useful."
5,cute swiss army knife,I love my new green swiss army knife....I have never seen one like this in the stores...I keep it on my keychain for emergency purposes.
4,Good Show Cut short,This show was incredibly hilarious when it aired but due to poor direction and consistency it fell short of it's potential. One can see the differences between the first and second DVD's and how the show was pushed and pulled by all parties involved with producing it. All in all most of the episodes are thoroughly entertaining and deserve credit. The rest we can chalk up to management mistakes. It is yet another example of how the creative element should be allowed to develop their ideas without too much intervention from the financers.
4,Greg the Bunny review,"You see a show that casts Seth Green, Sarah Silvermen, Eugene Levy and Susan the Monster and what do you think of? Thats right another brilliant show that Fox cancels mid season. It went the way of Firefly and Family Guy. Both were brought back in one form or another and now so is Greg the Bunny. If you like this DVD then tune into the Independant Film Channel and see the naughtier side of Greg and Count Blah and Warren. They are now having the puppets act out parodies of films like Eraserhead, Pulp Fiction, Easy Rider and more... F*** You Fox!!!"
4,Greg the Bunny the Complete Series,"The Greg the Bunny series is hilarious. I can see why it didn't make it on network television -- even Fox. It is irreverent and certainly not politically correct. But it is correct in many other ways. The show lampoons hypocrisy and celebrates honesty. It is also extremely funny. This show, like South Park and the Simpsons, can be taken on several levels. It is certainly not meant for kids, though pre-teens would probably love it. I would allow my teenage children to watch--if I watched it with them and discussed the content."
4,Gone too soon,"Like Fox is famous for, ""Greg The Bunny"" was gone too soon. With each of the 13 episodes side-splittingly funny, and extremely quotable, it's somewhat difficult to understand why this show was cancelled. Maybe because it was a bit edgy? But then again when has Fox really shied away from edgy. Family Guy was on 3 seasons...then returned.Eugene Levy and Seth Green are in rare form. Levy's quick, dry humor and Green's sarcasm click perfectly. I definately recommend."
5,K... Now I'm P!ssed Off!! WS on HDnet!!!,"Great Series... Can't rave enough about the hilarity of this series. But next to being angered by FOX from cancelling one of it's many great series; I just discovered tonight that ""Greg the Bunny"" is now making appearances on HDnet, a high-def version of it non-the-less. Widescreen and 5.1 sound!!! The sound takes a back seat knowing now that it must have been filmed in WS. Just caught episode 2 ""Sock Like Me"" and seeing it in WS adds a bit more to the perspective. FOX... please re-release this in 5.1 WS!!!!!! Well worth it in FS... but more than worth it if released in WS."
5,My wish come true.,"Wow, this is great, my day has just been made. I wrote an article in my school paper about TV shows on DVD and had wishlist of some of my favorite shows. And ALL of them except one are or are about to be released on DVD. ""ALF"", ""Arrested Development"", ""Seinfeld"", and FINALLY ""Greg the Bunny."" Now I just have to wait for ""Andy Richter Controls the Universe.""I would come home from school every Tuesday and sit by the TV waiting for this show to come on. It was so original, funny, and off-the-wall that you could almost tell it wasn't going to last, so I wanted to see it as much as possible. FOX didn't really give this show a fighting chance, which is a real shame. I can't wait to watch all of these classic episodes again on DVD! I'm so happy! lol."
3,Regarding FOX,"I've noticed that FOX likes to cancel shows in their prime... I felt that they didn't give firefly a fighting chance but I'M SO GLAD that Joss Whedon is coming out with firefly the movie! Perhaps if the producer saw how much people miss ""Greg the Bunny"" then they'd be able to either make a movie or get it on another station besides Fox...Fox just doesn't know a good thing when it sees it. Search for websites to save your canceled show!"
2,moderatly amusing,"this show is just not that good. im sorry i hate to break it to all you greg the bunny fans. this show is piss poor .this show is the equivilent to a crapy stand up comedian with someone elses fairly decent material .its just poorly done. its like it was trying to be so many other things and trying so hard to be buzz words like ""edgey"" ""irrevrent"" . i think this show had a bunch of writers who watched and liked shows that were everything this one wanted to be, but were just not capable if pulling it off . it thinks ....wait thought .... it was new and original but the fact of the matter is making fun of cory feldman stopped being funny about six years ago . dont buy this dvdi did laugh a couple of times though but not enough to warrent the purchase of this dvd"
5,A review by a follower,"This is by far the best book for non-Arabic readers. While Ustazh Taha had written over 30 books detailing his thought about Islam and proposing solutions for mankind problems, only two of these books were ever translated to foreign languages. The fact that the translator, Dr. Abdullahi An-Na'em was himself a follower of the teachings of Ustadh Taha, and a renowned international law professor and human rights actvisit, makes this work readable to westerners, while sticking to the original meaning of the Arabic text. No man has been so misunderstood and his thoughts and deeds unappreciated as Ustadh Taha, both at the local and global levels..."
3,A paradoxical book,"Mahmoud Mohamed Taha is one of the most original and daring of modern Islamic thinkers. This book of his, undeservedly ignored in the so-called liberated West, is a proclamation of reform and tolerance, against the oppression and despotisms that currently enmesh the Muslim world. He was a man who refused to recant, regardless of the hostility of public opinion during the dictatorial regime of Ja'ffar Nimerei, and chose instead to suffer the martyrdom of the hangman's rope. Nowadays, his followers dare not declare themselves, nor breathe a word of his teachings publicly, for fear of being persecuted and stigmatised. Admittedly, his doctrine may seem unrealistic today, in the world of multinational companies and mass consumerism. Much of it is riddled by logical contradictions. For example, it is nonsensical to talk of reforming Islam, a religion which is doctrinally irreformable. But even if one doesn't agree with him, one is still moved to admire his courage..."
5,Simply the Best Choir Album I've heard this year...,"If you want to get into the mood to go to church this is it. From beginning to end, the cd blends spoken words of inspiration and encouragement with songs of faith. Mustard Seed Faith, I Was Created, and congregational favors The Lord Thy God and the Victory Chant will have you ready to worship when you get int the doors of your own sanctuary. The music and the songs are perfectly suited and the cd is not overloaded, like some of this genre, with too much word and not enough song. This is a wonderful cd and once you purchase it you won't be able to listen to anything else for a long time."
1,waiting,"After more Ships, Swords and Sex adventours of our hero Allan Lewry his fans are still waiting, 14 months later what becomes of him; will he make Flag Rank, will he reconcile with his wife Caroline or will he live together with his Greek piece of fluff and their son. Will his father marry the young French Vicomtesse or may Allan even be elevated to the nobility for some heroic deed yet to be performed?Hey Mr. Lambdin, don't keep us in suspense."
2,The Captain's Vengeance - A Slow Read,"I should start by saying I'm a fan of this series, however I've found this novel to be the least entertaining that I've read in this story line. If you have found that you are enjoying the series, and you want to continue the saga, then this is a must read. If however you are sampling one of the books to see how you like the Lewrie novels... don't start here."
2,Disappointment,"After zipping through the first 11 books (sometimes just a day or two each), it took me a month to finish this one. Dewey Lambdin takes Captain Lewrie off his frigate and wastes nearly the whole novel ashore in a silly, contrived, and painfully-drawn-out New Orleans spy caper, with fan-service sex scenes so awkward that, instead of being titillated, you just want to turn away in embarrassment.I wasn't sure if I was even going to bother finishing it, but I would like to read the rest of the series (assuming the author got this out of his system), and didn't want to miss any context. Here's hoping book 13 gets back on course. If you're going to skip any book in the series, though, this is the one."
3,Te Captain's engence,This book was very good bt not as high adventere as some of his other books Still I would recommend highly
4,Easing Into Sleep---CD buyers be warned,"I had this cassette when I was in high school. I wore it out and it really helped me to sleep. I went to Miller's webs site to buy the CD version. I listened to the mp3 audio clip and I was thrilled to find it. I ordered it and couldn't wait to get it.Upon receipt, the CD ""Easing Into Sleep"" is NOT the same as the cassette. It is a totally re-vamped version of the classic sleep tape. It doesn't even sound like Miller. I contacted their customer service and was informed that you can only get the classic sleep tape on cassette that is no longer in print. When asked why they use the old mp3 clip that is no longer available, they had no comment.Shame on you Dr. Miller for the bait and switch. :("
3,Not too many beginner's tips on training & cue ball control,"If you are a once-a-week 3-hour player like me, you might want to pass this book. While there are numerous advanced techniques and some excellent diagrams, this just might not be the book to take you beyond an advanced-beginner's level.The book sorely lacks details on techniques & practice tips on cue ball control, which distinguishes the novice from the advanced. The author relies on your 'natural ability' to master the cue ball and hence misses out on a very very important aspect of mastering the game."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"Oh My gosh, this is THE BEST BOOK I've EVER read! This awesome book is garenteed to educate you on 4 of the best ventriloquists in american history! This is an awesome book, filled with lots of photos and fun stories. WELL WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY!"
5,DON'T BE A DUMMY! BUY/READ THIS GREAT BOOK NOW!!!,"DUMMY DAYS is one of the most readable and fun books ever written on that era in TV when ventriloquists and their puppets ruled. I was given this book as a gift and, once I started reading, could not put it down. DUMMY DAYS is absolutely wonderful from cover to cover, filled with amazing photos and stories. It brings back great memories."
1,Very Poor Attention to Detail = Poor Credibility,"I've worked my way through the first 100 pages or so, and although the book is generally quite readable, I am very disappointed in the quality thus far. I have found numerous errors, for example:p. 87: (Question 3) Two answers are exactly the same.p. 92: (Question 23) The groups should probably include the suffix ""A"" (IA, IIA, etc.).p. 105: 2,3,5-trimethylhexane is misidentified as 1,3,5-...p. 107: The structure for 1-propyne is incorrect.Admittedly, some of these errors are minor, but my concern is for the mistakes that I will NOT find and thus potentially cause me problems as I study for this exam."
3,Children's Crusade Gallant and Sad,I read this for my bookclub and we all enjoyed the book in general. The story is very sad but the characters all held our interest; the journey was long and hard. The ending somewhat predictable.
4,Beautiful like snow,"I got this CD after seeing the video for ""Never Back Down"" and got hoocked. There is something very David Grey-ish about Novastar, his voice is soft and sad and the songs are pure gems."
3,Looks OK as There is Nothing Much to it!,"This review is for;Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway - WindmillWas originally included with ""Let's Have a Race"" or ""Steaming Around Sodor"" Thomas Learing Curve train sets, but it is available seperately although it appears very pricey to purchase it on it's own. Nothing special about this one. Comes in two major wooden pieces (upper & lower piece are made of wood). Fan blade is plastic. Upper wooden piece rotates on the wooden base as well as the plastic fan blade. Just looks OK to add to train track sets."
3,AC Delco D465,"This appears to be of a good quality, not anything to write home about, but good enough, I would probably look at other brands before I purchased again."
3,Ol' Skool Funk at it's best !,This is a great party DVD - the music keeps you on your feet the whole time and the band's infectious energy is great ! Definitely one to get !
4,A Beautiful exposition of Marian devotion,"Initially I found this apostolic exhortation hard to read. I picked it up and put it down many times over the course of a few months, till finally I forced myself to read it over the course of a week. n this letter Pope Paul VI lays down the reasons around Marian devotion, what it is, and what it should not be. Some of the language is a little bit dated (for instance the use of the eclessial ""We"")but I think the message presented is still clear and relevant more than thirty years after it was written."
4,Great for Younger Kids who have Trouble with Wooden Supports,"This is what it is, exactly as pictured: bridge supports for Thomas the Tank Engine wooden railway tracks. I highly recommend this for younger kids (2-3) who still have trouble with the wooden (block) riser supports which tip over too easily. These are very sturdy, stack-able (meaning different lines of track can cross over or under each other, not just a lone track higher up), and easy for little hands. Wish the price were half of what it is, but I suppose I say that about all Thomas the Tank Engine stuff! No complaints otherwise..."
5,great pieces,I was a little skeptical buying this as they looked easily broken. They are stronger than they look. I have 2 and 4 yr olds and we've had them for 6 months. They really help keep the track up to lots of 'crashes'.
5,Great toy good price,We've been buying Thomas trains and accessories for almost 3 years now and this was a great addition to an already plentiful collection.
4,Good little toy,"reasonably good design and build quality. it can be a little tight for some cars going under the bridge supports and this toy could be very unfun to step on or fall on, so keep it picked up.good toy overall."
2,It's okay...,"I read 'Unfinished Business' by Ms. Langhorne and enjoyed it alot.'A Personal Matter' kept me interested. The author has a great writing style. It's funny, well written and easy to read. The issue I had with the book was the lead character Alayna. She was unlikeable and had a HUGE chip on her shoulder. Every other word out of her mouth was ""white people this"" and ""white people that"". It made me uncomfortable and slightly annoyed. Towards the end, Alayna 'sort of' saw her own faults but it still didn't redeem her in my view."
4,Good Read,I enjoyed the book and the wide array of characters. Martine was a piece of work when she moved her boyfriend into the house without asking and I thought Alayna handled it in an interesting way of moving out. All in all I enjoyed the book.
3,"Oooooh, I had to take a break from this book.","I HATE THE HEROINE. She was overly aggressive, annoying, mean, mouthy, and judgemental. I was not surprised that she was a virgin (a guy would really need to take one for the team to deal with her mouth). It was not a bad book; it was just a book with an unlikable leading lady. Ice was not a bad hero."
4,A Good Story as well as IR romance,"I enjoyed the storyline, the strong chracters, and sub-plots. I recommend this book as well as JJ Murray books."
4,A pleasurable read,"Because I have been a legal secretary for several years, this book piqued my interest. I thought that the plot and story were well written and very realistic. There were two characters that I loved. . . one was Jamal and the other was Ben Richards. Jamal was a very mature, admirable 18 year old who was determined to hold his own. Ben was very strong willed and extremely confident and did not allow the ""good 'ole boy"" system dictate his life. The author touched on racism from both black and white perspectives. I also liked the chemistry that developed between Alayna and Ben and how their feelings for one another ascended color barriers.I would recommend this book."
2,I couldn't stand the heroine,"The story was ok. I liked Ben, but just couldn't stand the heroine or her spoiled and ungrateful as hell sister. Half of the time, I couldn't believe the crap that came out of the sister's mouth and the fact that the heroine seemed to have tons of attitude towards everyone except the one who deserved it. She, Alayna, seemed a bit too stereotypical to me...with all the eye rolling and head rolling, etc...Her character and her sister were what stopped me from giving this 4 stars."
4,I liked the characters!,"What a good book! It was one that I couldn't put down. I had to keep reading to see how the story would progress. I really appreciated the conversations held between the female and male leads. The female had spunk and came across as real, and though I didn't really care for the grammar she sometimes used, it also was real (I can hear my family now saying that I'm too uptight about grammar!). Ben, aka ""Ice,"" was appealing and had some mystery about him. The two characters came to appreciate what each brought to the table, and that I can respect. Though each had family issues going on, they were there to support each other through them--whether they wanted to be or not! And I even came to like the female ""redneck""--I can't remember her actual name. She was just misunderstood, is all. I would recommend this book for anyone."
2,"""I've read better""","""A personal matter"" was the second book I've read from Karyn Langhorne , ""Unfinished bussiness"" was the first one and believe me I don't think I'll ever read anymore of her books. They have 3/4 of drama and 1/4 of something that resembles romance; barely. Way too much drama."
4,Surprised,I could not put this book down. I like the fact that Ali was very independent and spoke her mind. There are not a lot of books that have such a strong female character. It was also refresing to read a book about people who did not fall in love at first site.
1,Heresy,"Whoa you had better not be a Christian reaching out for this book with anys eriousness. It is New Age so far as I can see. Some sort of blurry weirdness between oddly invented new Age Christianity and get rich fundamentalist preachers having you mutter over and over, ""Money is in my pocket Oh Lord!""Yeah, yeah, you probably landed here from the ""etiquette"" training given by Gloria. This book is mentioned out there in that ole 29 dollar ebook. Fine, you too no longer hold your fork in the right hand, but frankly this book lacks ""poise."" I am too above muttering, ""Money in my pocket Oh Lord."" And I don't want to meet anyone with a ""wheel"" and money mantras. I prefer that they get out of my face."
5,Prosperity is real,"All I can say is if you really want your hearts desire and want to keep spirituality in all your wants and needs, this is the book for you. I have given this book to my mother, my secretary and I bought a copy just because. This book is for any one searching for a higher level of understanding,who is seeking guidance in tapping into their on abilities to have what is ours/theirs just for believing in our Blessed Trinity Higher Power. No hocus pocus involved."
2,Not Good Enuff!!!,"I must admit that i'm usually reluctant writing reviews on other people's hard work, EXCEPT NOW!!!This book will help you FAIL your BCRAN!! No doubt.It's written in a format that gives you the confidence that it covers all aspects of the required exam. It doesn't!!I had to spend an hour or two in a bookshop reading the details and proper configuration explanantion of PPPoe.The book treats dialer-watch as non-existent!That's THREE exam questions!!Get my drift yet??There's also a very woolly explanation of queueing and compression!!.My knowlege and experience of Qos got me through.....3/4 questions!!Remeber, i'm no new kid on the block here...Over 9 year's experience....and still failed firsttime...by 80marks!!I resat the exam 6 working days later, having checked out the weak areas (not covered by this 'book'), and looking at exam cram and testking.I scored 930!!! something not right!!Good book for the shelf...that's about it!! sorry.Be warned."
1,Excellent Book to prop the old desk up!!!!,"This book has so many errors, and missed topics its not worth your time purchasing this book. I used the BCRAN Student Guide instead to pass this test."
1,Nice but not good,The book was nice to get started on but failed in covering all topics on the test. I counted that I know of 6 questions on the test that the book only mentions the name of the topic once with no description. Being that the book came from CiscoPress I was very displeased. I expect this from other study guides but not CP. By the way who ever did the editing is smoking something. I came across several questions in book questions that had incorrect answers. Also descriptions on certain topics said one thing and then told you another thing on the next page. I think the only reason I gave it 1 start is that it is someplace to get started and that is as low as they will let me set it. If Brain Morgan wrote some of these things then I would question his CCIE cert.
2,Does NOT Cover The Test,"After studying this book and taking the test, I found this book to not be of much use! There are so many questions that are asked on the exam that are not covered, or barely touched on in the book that I would not recommend this book for preparation for the exam! I have taken many CISCO tests and have scored over 900 on most of them, to study a Cisco Press book and not have it cover the material is VERY Disappointing!"
3,ok but not sufficient to pass the exam,"After taking the BCRAN exam, I've noticed that there were quite a bit of questions that were not mentioned or discussed in this book. You can't rely on this book alone and assume that you're ready to pass the exam, or be prepared to see your $125 to go down the drain. I have to agree with other reviewers for the lack of edit fix. There're mistakes, some are rather obvious, some others not so obvious. It's quite disappointing that Ciscopress book can't cover the whole exam content. If Ciscopress book can't do the satisfactory job, where else do we turn to? I only hope that other books do a better job."
5,I love this movie!!!,"Very good movie, good actors and a lot action...Fernanda Montenegro is great, and the main characters are the best one ever, I don't see this movie being with another ones..."
5,Great deal,"These sheets are a great deal. They are very soft and comfy. They are oversized a little, therefore they fit very nicely."
5,"Easy to modify, and therefore easy to stay with","The problem that I have with most diet plans is that they are too restrictive. This one is not. More importantly, there are enough recipes and choices that it is easy to modify, and therefore easy to stick with. Try as I might, I don't like carrots and mushrooms, but that doesn't mean that I have to eat those things if I am on the plan. I'm free to pick and choose and even challenge myself to eat things I usually don't on days I do feel like it. The best thing is that the foods are easy to make and realistic. Stir Fry, Steak, and Spaghetti are all ""real"" foods that don't take much skill or time to put together which is VERY important. After two weeks, I'm learning the value of fruit as a snack, the value of eliminating 60 cals from a sandwich by changing the type of bread I buy, and that if I want to indulge in a few girl scout cookies it's okay. I've lost four pounds in two weeks, despite some liberal substitutions, and I think that's great."
5,MUST GET THIS BOOK!,"I have never had any success with ""dieting"" unitl I read this book. I decided to give it a try after reading the reviews. I can honestly say it works. I purchased the book and after 2 weeks I lost 4 lbs. (without any hunger or feeling deprived). It's easy to read/understand and I still use it as a reference guide. If I could follow this plan, anyone can!"
2,Disappointed Have not lost a pound but have lost inches,I bought this book and started 2 weeks ago and have not lost a pound. I did the 1200 calorie plan step by step with exercising and weights four times a week. Now I feel better and lighter and my clothes fit better but the scale has not moved and that really disappoints me. I am thinking it maybe the funfood. Whether your eating 250 calories of cake or apple the fat is the difference and most of the fun foods are very fattening and I think that maybe a problem for someone like me who has real trouble losing weight. I am about to give up because it seems like I am just maintaing with 1200 calories. Did much better on ADkins but was getting scared of that way of eating.
1,Scientifically Designed?,"Don't waste your time or money on this one. ""Scientifically designed"" should imply the following: documented case studies, control groups, statistical analysis of the data (to support the 90/10 theory) followed by peer review in scientific journals. There is no evidence of ""scientific design"" present in this book. Unfortunately, this becomes one of the fad diets the author warns us about. In fact, she even cautions the reader about trans fats, only to condone eating foods that are notoriously loaded with trans fats (not all of us live in New York where trans fat are prohibited in restaurants). I will probably regret giving this book even one star because, although obviously an intelligent lady, the author is nevertheless naive and irresponsible with her unsubstantiated diet advice. ""Fun Foods""? Give me a break! This means that it's okay to intermittently eat nutritionally deficient ""junk foods"" for well over a month throughout your year (10% of the time)."
5,Finally! A realistic plan with cheating built in!,"I intended to buy The South Beach Diet, but after flipping through it and seeing all the 15-ingredient recipes, I put it right back on the shelf and started browsing. I found 90/10 and decided to take it home with me when I saw that the foods listed were really easy to prepare and that I could have a little of the good stuff (like Nutter Butters, ice cream and french fries) every day. Each meal is assigned a caloric value, so it's easy to make substitutions. This book is a great tool and I'm so glad I found it!"
2,Fun Foods??,"Well, Joy, I just love her, but The fun foods were fun but spoiled the fun weight loss! We (my husband and I) Did not lose an ounce and we were on it for at least one month. We switched to The Rotation Diet and I lost 17 pounds."
2,Not very helpful and kind of confusing,"It could be just me but I found this book very confusing to follow and not very interesting...I didn't feel motivated at all...It may have not worked for me, but that does not mean it will not work for any one else...good luck"
2,Too Few Menus,"The diet is good, however, there are not enough menus or variety for someone who needs substantial weight loss. Clam sauce--YUCK. Sole--YUCK. ETC."
4,Mega Lego not,Legos are great and our children love to play with them. It was a good thing we already had some legos though because really the package was filled with 95% air.
4,Lego cubes Fund,Famous Lego cubes come in a box and keeps it nice not scattered on the floor and protect it from a place suitable for those who lost their children more than three years
5,Tub of fun!,"First non-Duplo LEGO's for our daughter, she is in love! Lots of interesting pieces, built the helicopter and some of the other small items in the instruction book, always a favorite."
5,Cool,My son loved this collection of LEGO'S!! They get all over the floor so get stepped on which hurts but my son loves to build with them!!
5,Great,Exactly what I wanted when I wanted it. Great service at a fair price. My son loves it and it made his bday
4,Lego,Perfect for the dream Lego builder. Thought it should have come with more of the little people but other than that the kids were pretty satisfied with it.
4,Like its variety,Kids loved the # of possibilities to create things and grandchildren enjoyed playing toghether with all the pieces and came up with a great invention on their own.
3,405 seems like a lot but...,"I bought this set so my son would have one when he travels, but 405 really isn't a lot. Next time, i'd spend a little extra for the 700piece set"
5,basic lego set,"good assortment for a variety of lego building projects. Kids are creative and ""do their own thing"" but would suggest a few more patterns such as are found in specific kits....with block by block directions for more involved projects. It would help them learn to follow directions as well as give them a feeling of accomplishment when doing a more involved ""creation""/"
3,LEGO set,Gives a lot of basic LEGOs. Good additional set to already established lego collection...not a whole lot of fun if these are your only LEGOs since childhood and your parents gave away all your old ones...
5,Best Idea,"My 12 year old son loved this gift. Coupled with the Lego Big Ideas book, he has been creating nonstop."
3,Sounds like alot!,405 pieces really isn't alot. My daughter could only make 4 or 5 small pieces out of the Lego Ideas Book. I would suggest buying more than one set.
5,Awesome!,I purchased these for my 7 year old son. HeIs older brother has them and he wanted his own set. Great deal and Christmas is not complete without Legos!
3,Big box is deceiving...,"This big ""ultimate"" lego box looks so big but once you open it and the bags they are in, it ends up being about 1/4 full which is disappointing. It is a good starter set but I think you need at least 2-3 of these boxes to make anything interesting over a few inches.Update: My daughter likes these legos but has gone back to her trusty duplos since they offer more variety, height and ease of use. I will try and get a bulk set to add to these but legos are very expensive for what you get. Within the 405 pieces, many are only one tiny square big or half the depth as a basic lego - meaning you have to stack 2 on top of each other to get a basic lego height. They seem very hard to put together too. Overall I am very disappointed in the purchase."
3,"Big Box, Little Legos","I have been searching for a nice box of good old fashioned legos for my 6 year old. To our disappointment, there are very few pieces in this roomy box. Kids can only really build one or two things at a time as there are not enough peices to do more. I would recommend buying a few other sets of legos to add to this kit..."
4,Love Legos,I was excited to get this for my sons 7th birthday. He loves legos and has over time lost many in the set he has. I am pleased with the value and the excitement in my child. Money wisely spent. =)
5,Love the options!!,"I love that the bucket of legos has so many options. You are not limited to build only one item!! My 9 year old son spends hours and hours building, tearing down, and building something new. It's amazing! I wish I would have thought of this so much earlier!!! :-)"
2,WARNING: Parts too small for a 2-year old,"We failed to spot the warning (have to scroll down to obscure area) about small parts.This needs to be an ""IN YOUR FACE"" warning, not tucked away below the screen.We will not even open this box until she is 3, or older, so we are not in positon to judge it as a product."
1,Box is almost empty what a ripoff!,The box has about two handfulls of leggo's and does not even have a big basepplate only the medium one. your better off buying 35.00 worth of loose leggo's and a generic plastic tub necaude the tub is not even very durable! This was a complete dissapointment!
2,Lack of building base plate makes set almost useless out of box.,"So, with all these hundreds of pieces you get one green base plate of about six sqare inches, which is almost useless, and a few even smaller base plate type pieces, which are indeed useless.There's plenty of room for a decent size base plate or two, or three or four, but nooooooooooo. If I want a base plate that can actually be used, like one that's ten or fifteen inches on a side, I need to go out and pay extreme amounts of money for them to buy them seperately (extreme considering they are single pieces of injection molde plastic).So, open your wallet, get out that credit card, and welcome to the wonderful world of legos!"
1,ok ... but not great for age,"This is a great play set for kids who wants to tickle their brain. However, I don't think this is for 4+ kids. May be 6+ would reasonable. Parts are really tiny and hard to handle if the 4+ kid is not focusing or messy."
1,came late,When you order something and are promised it will arrive time you expect it to be on time. I am disappointed.
5,LEGO'S on time,My Grandson loves them and said they are just what he wanted. I just have to watch where I walk because they are all over the floor in his room.
3,Very Tiny Pieces,"This was purchased for a 4 & 7 year old. The pices were extremely tiny. This is a pretty big box for the number of pieces that were in there. Based on how big the box was, I figured the pieces were going to be bigger. They are not really interested in this at the moment."
4,Needs more men,"Legos are pretty standard, but with 400+ peices more than one man would be nice. Otherwise....they're legos, pretty self explanatory!"
5,Great basic set,"A good assortment of basic bricks, plates, and ""special"" pieces to get your little one hooked on Lego. (Honestly? I kind of bought this for myself, not my kid. Fortunately she loves it too!) The ""special"" pieces are pretty basic - 1 set of 4 wheels, a couple of windows and doors, one minifig and some accessories for him. Enough to build a good-sized house, a helicopter, and a jeep, and have some extra pieces left over."
3,Expected a larger tub of blocks.,This was a Christmas present for a grandson. I was expecting a larger box of blocks for the price. He didn't open it while he was here so I didn't see the actual blocks. Legos are always great. I was just expecting a larger box like I have from 20 years ago.
4,LEGO Ultimate Building set,"Grandson can make lots of things from this set. Easy to build with the directions. Had lots of fun building things, by himself, with this set of lego, he is 6 years old."
2,Price is absurd,The cost of the cheaply made Legos for the amount in the package is way too much. The plegos of years ago were sturdy. Shame on the Lego industry.
5,LEGOS!!!,I can only say that I am so jealous for my nephew! I want to play with these so bad but they are his Christmas gift-got them fast and easy too!
2,Not for Small Children,I was very disappointed. The pieces are tiny and not appropriate for young children. This looks like a building set for adult or teenagers.
5,fantastic starter set,Couldn't be happier. My 4yr old loves playing with his legos at school and this is his first at-home starter set. It's been over 2mos now and the interest has not waned; the first thing he wants to do when he wakes up is build; last thought before going to sleep is what he built that day. This was a great starter set and it's been really hard for us not to keep adding to his ever growing collection.
5,LEGOS - The Classic Toy,"I bought this for my five year-old brother for Christmas and he really enjoys them. They're durable and brightly colored and the green foundation allows for the construction of whatever imagination dictates. The box it comes in is nice and has extra room for the storage of additional Legos or other toys. There is a pretty good diversity of block types and includes a few special pieces, as well as a person and wheels and a helicopter/airplane propeller ensuring that even flying machines can be built."
2,This is it?????,"Maybe its just that my expectations were too high, but I am extremely disappointed in the amount of legos that come with this set. First of all the box appears much bigger in the pictures and the number of legos (405) seemed like a lot. Well I was sadly mistaken. I bought 2 sets of these and there still seems to be a limited number of legos. The box is only about 1/4 full and the green placemat seems less than 10in. l/w.That being said...its still legos. My kids love them and I love when they bring me things they have made. They still have tons of fun...just for a much shorter period of time. I love legos...but I shouldnt have to buy 3 or 4 boxes to fill up what should be in 1."
5,LEGO Ultimate Building Set--405 pieces,"LEGOs at our house are always a favorite toy to play with when grandchildren come, so this year I needed more pieces for them to build their creations and they enjoyed the extra pieces we had."
3,Too many tiny pieces,I should have thoroughly read the reviews of the product before ordering. We were very excited to get our son a lego set as he is very interested in building things. This set disappoints a bit because the majority of the pieces are very tiny and he couldn't really make anything easily. He just turned 4 so we will put it aside for a while. You definitely need other sets for this to compliment. There are many single tiny smaller than his pinky finger nail size pieces.
5,GIFT FOR GRANDSON,"MY 12 YEARS OLD GRANDSON LOVES LEGOS. THIS ADDED TO THE 1000""S HE ALL READY HAS. HE LOVES LEGOS AND SO DOES HIS LITTLE BROTHER.LEGOS ARE GREAT FOR CREATIVITY AND IT GETS THEM AWAY FROM THE VIDEO GAMES : ) ARRIVED TIMELY TO JAPAN."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was excited for this product to arrive as my grand children were bored with the older Lego set they have been playing with. But I was so disappointed when I opened this box to find that the pieces are very small. In fact, all of the pieces emptied out in the large container that shipped with the product, barely cover the bottom of the container. Had I known these pieces were so small, I would not have ordered it. This is definately not worth the money (it should have sold for under $20...I'm sure that the product only cost Lego $3 to manufacture). What a disappointment!"
5,Lego's for older children,"Great product, storage case, and creative toy for old children - - very small pieces so not for little ones. Hours of fun especially on rainy or cold days."
5,Lego Buileding Set,If the child takes care of his toys this toy lasts and laswts. It teachs them to be creative and use their imagination ovr and over again.
3,Not so Ultimate,"As the previous reviewer indicated, when you actually open the package its not as impressive as the size of the container would indicate. Sure its legos and they are fun but come on, if you are going to brand it as the 'Ultimate' give it a good amount. I also noticed the seller has it listed at 79.99. Give me a break it cost less than $25 at Target. What a ripoff!"
4,legos,nice. same as the other legos. such small pieces are hard to keep but the kids like to build things with them.
3,Fun purchase,"Great toy---I suppose I am looking at it from a parents' perspective. My child was happy with it, and really enjoyed the carrying case. I think I wish it had a few more things for them to build----they were able to build a house, a helicopter, and one more item. Didn't give any more options than that."
5,What Can I Say.....They're LEGOS!,"We gave this to our grandson, who's 9, for his birthday and, of course, he loved them. Before, he had to share the Legos we kept at our house with his brothers, now he has his very own. What's not to like? They're durable and promote lots of imagination. Kids love Legos, grownups love Legos, everyone loves Legos!"
3,Great Starter Set,"A good starter set for youngsters moving up from the Duplo sets. Included pictures help kids to figure out what they might like to build, whether it's following the picture exactly or build something brand new."
3,Fun but not many pieces,"I was excited about introducing these to my daughter, but was diappointed with the number of pieces that came with it. It's a big bin and very few legos. I know it says 405 pieces, but it doesn't seem like there are that many in there. Ita more of a big empty box with some legos at the bottom, which doesn't make it very inviting to play with. Not a good value for the price. I'm considering returning it."
5,Legos,My grandson loves Legos and this has given him hours of fun to build and occupy himself. Whole family loves the lego's.
5,it's a big box of legos...,"There's nothing to dislike about a big box of Legos, except the price. But we pay more to avoid plastic Chinese junk, so it's worth it."
3,Smaller set & missing pieces,"This set was about right for the price, but the box it comes in is quite large - I appreciate Lego thinking ahead for storing additional sets, but I do have some complaints.1) The box is really flimsy and sometimes the kids have a hard time putting the lid on because it warps so easily.2) There were at least two pieces missing - right out of the box. We tried to build the car (with the included instructions) but after 30 minutes of frustrated sorting and hunting, we discovered one of the wheel axles was missing entirely.I almost returned the item because of this, but I kept it.I wish the quality control was 100%, but for the price, this starter box of Legos is still decent."
5,Must have,"This is a great starter set of Lego's. There's no real theme or anything, just use your imagination and build. Just don't step on them with bare feet!!"
4,Smaller then i thought,"OK so i bought this thinking it would be pretty big, and it got here, fed ex left it outside in the rain(which is irrelevant but i added it anyways)and i opened it and to my surprise it was kinda small. the grass it comes with is about 3 maybe 4 inches on each side, and the overall box is about 2 and 1/2 times that size in length, but overall i had tons of fun with this. i am a 19 year old female that has never gotten to buy her own legos, and sorry if im playing like a little kid but these are so fun ^.^ the first thing i did was build a house and a dog, i can see this keeping little kids entertained for HOURS on end.Price 3.5/5Fun level 5/5Shipping speed 5/5I hope i helped you with your purchase."
5,I love it,Good price. A lots of fun.Good price. A lots of fun.Good price. A lots of fun.Good price. A lots of fun.
5,Legos rule!,"As a kid 'way back when, I always loved playing with Legos. I ordered this basic set for my nephew because I knew it would be the perfect starter set for his building instincts. The only Legos available in my local toy stores were the specialty sets that took all the creativity out of playing with them. I thank Amazon for having exactly what was needed, at a most reasonable price."
3,Wished there were more pieces,Not alot of pieces. I guess I forgot how small they are. I'm not sure why legos are so expensive. Wished the base plate was bigger too.
4,"Great assortment, but...","My son loves this set, at 3 he just covered the square with one level, I don't think he got building up until after I showed him multiple times, but now at just over 4 he is building intricate things. The only reason I give this a 4 stars overall, is because I wanted to use the bucket to store ALL of his Legos in (the box only comes about 1/3 full at the most), but the larger green board for building on wouldn't fit, and the board it comes with is tiny, inhibiting big creative projects. Otherwise an awesome toy that brings out the kid in me as well when I play with my son."
3,Overpriced,"I bought this thinking it was the perfect gift for my 4 year old nephew, and it is. Wonderful set with everything you need, however, this same exact set was found at Sam's Club for HALF the price. If you can visit a Sam's, it will only cost you $25. I am so bummed I didn't shop around first."
4,is great,i wait a few days but i recived in perfect conditions is a good toys for kids and for gift is perfect!!!
4,Not as impressive as it sounds,Nice pieces overall. Variety well chosen. Sounds like there would be more to it the box isn't even full. Very nice durable box with see through lid.
3,Probably for 6+ older...,"For the most part this was a good toy. I got this for my 5 year-old on his birthday, but most of the pieces are a little too complex for him. Also, the base plate Lego that you build Legos on is way too small (may 3"" X 3"") to build things one. Lastly, the pamphlet shows great ideas on what you can build with the Legos, but only SHOWS you how to make about 10 of them."
5,Great Concert Feel,"Saw No Doubt in concert for the first and only time two summers ago in Philly, this dvd took me back but really took me back, it's so amazing to see the band so young right when they're really up and coming. And although the sound mixing is a little messy at times, that's truly what gave it a great live concert feel - Gwen's voice isn't perfectly on key a few times either, but that's what happens when you're running around rocking a stage! Very refreshing, plus the Bonus Features include homemade movies of the band from '92 to '97 when they were first starting to tour and write and really get into it. Definitely enjoyable!"
2,WHAT THE HELLA!!!,The sound quality is not bad. The picture quality is not bad. What is bad is the orchestrated act of this being an actual live concert. It is scripted like a musical act straight out of a Hollywood movie. You can tell that this routine has been practiced over and over until the powers that be were happy. I don't blame NO DOUBT they were young and did what they had to do make it. However I know each of them regret this act. I've seen NO DOUBT every time they have came to Chicago and the surrounding states and have never witnessed a concert as played up as this. If you like NO DOUBT I would say go ahead and get this DVD you will enjoy it. But if you're a die hard fan I would say save yourself the pain of watching your band bend to the powers that control the music industry.
3,Baraboo Guards,"Worth reading as a portrayal of some aspects of Civil War soldier life. Driscoll does battle pretty well, and daily life better. He understands the community nature of a company.He's not great at social mentalities, though. However earthy they may have been, I can't imagine 19th century people as promiscuous as this--particularly the well-bred judge's daughter, who would have ruined her entire life if she acted the way she does here.Characters are fairly well-done with the above reservation, though I found Murphy as ""wise Irishman"" a bit too familiar. Sentence-level writing doesn't particularly shine."
5,Great,I watch Biography a lot and I can safely say that this is one of my favorite episodes. It shows Price's evolution through the years and how he was under-rated and often dismissed as a B movie actor. Vincent Price was very under-rated and this video keeps his legacy alive.
4,Enjoyable,"A worthy volume. However, those of us considering this will likely have most of the data, photos and drawings Burt presents. The line drawings are superior for everything except armor disposition, which gets a lengthy written description. A few anecdotes were new to me. My preference is for Parkes' book (which Burt rightly credits), hence 4 stars only.This is on the whole a great resource for wargamers.Beware the stratospheric prices sometimes seen amongst the used vendors. I recommend checking out an inter-library loan before spending more than $100."
5,The definitive study...,"Burt gives us a thumbnail sketch of each capital ship the Royal Navy produced and operated in the first world war. As a bonus, there are great line drawings, photos, and modification histories.Recommended without reserve."
1,Time Waster,"I purchased this for use with my new Imac only to learn that many many MAC users have problems getting the Mac to recognize the device. Despite the fact that these complaints are widespread, Iomega and its software company don't disclose the problem or provide information on a fix or work around. I've never written an amazon review before but felt obligated to warn others. If you are looking for a back up drive to use with a MAC this is not for you. Iomega's customer support (which charges $25 per call) is the worst I've ever encountered. You know that seen in Office Space where they smash the printer? If you have a MAC you too will dream about using a baseball bat on the Iomega 500 gb."
1,Very disappointed,"I own three other IOMEGA drives 60GB each which I have been very happy with. Easy to install no problems. So I finally decided to go for this high GB drive and.... The first one sent to me by Amazon, did not start up. The blue light just flashed and the drive basically just never started. Online I read this may have reflected a problem with the power cord but who knows. So wrote it off to bad luck, got a replacement from Amazon. Replacement starts up, I start transferring music files from my computer hard drive. About two hours in to it the drive stops operating and just shuts down. I have a std IMAC no alterations, nothing special about it. So I'm returning this time for a refund. I may have just had a run of bad luck but it makes me wonder about IOMEGA quality control."
1,Not for an imac !!!!!,"I had the first one work one time. After several weeks I decided to backup again. It would not connect on my imac. I called Iomega and they started me through a series of steps to get it connected. About the third step we found out it had a major crash. I thought they had found the problem. They sent me a second one and it connected for about three minutes and then disconnected. I would not trust my files on it now even if they sent me another one. I guess I now have an extra paper weight. I gave it to my son in law to try on his windows xp,if it doesn't work I told him to trash it. Never will I buy another Iomega!!!!!!"
1,Shameful,"The Harvard Crimson is not only a technically lacking newspaper, it is a shamefully greedy institution, as this book proves. The concept behing this book is clearly, ""let's print out all our own application essays and sell them. Zero cost or work for us."" The essays are nothing special, and high schoolers would be harming their own admissions chances by attempting to copy ideas or devices from this book. Technical advice is far more important than actual individualized examples, yet it is sorely lacking here. Go Lampoon."
1,Inspires a zero stars option,"Yet again, I have to take my hat off to the Harvard Crimson for once again taking their self-promoting, self-congratulating, faux-introspective, greedy little selves and making some money off it. I'm not sure if the Crimson is still techincally a newspaper, and I'm not sure if the Crimson Editors are still technically people, but I am very certain, having not read this book but having gone to Harvard (boo-ya!), that people who go to Harvard tend to be jackasses and the people who work for the Crimson are even worse. The best contribution to the future academic success of America's youth that this group could muster would be if they just shot themselves in the face, which would not help in any clear way but would be a general improvement to the lot of the human race. Be warned: these people want to be our leaders some day. Go Lampy."
5,An excellent book if used correctly.,"I remember when this book came out and I was in middle school! Reading it then the essays seemed intimidating, but by the time I applied to College I was really ready to digest the book and compose my own essay. The best thing to take away from it is the tone and depth of the essays, don't just copy them or use the same idea and change the diction. I had the pleasure of working on the second edition of this book which comes out in September (I got to write a critique of one of the new essays), so I might be a little biased. Yet, as a Harvard Student that has worked in the admissions office, I can now say that these essays are good examples of what is expected and that the critiques are on the level of those you would receive from any admissions officer or guidance counselor."
5,Bought it for my brother,"I am a rising Harvard senior, and when I applied was not a very good writer - much more the math & science type. I had a great deal of trouble writing my essay until my parents bought me some guidebooks with samples. My brother is applying to college now and having looked at a lot of different books this one is far and away the best. I bought my brother a copy of this Crimson essay book last week and even he, who happens to be a good writer, found it immensely useful."
1,waste of money,"I am a recent graduate of Harvard College. For those of you interested in getting into Harvard, I would suggest that: 1. You not read this book. Instead, I would urge you to think hard about who you are; and where you have been/where you want to go in life."
1,Don't believe the other reviews...,How many of these other reviews do you think have actually been written by Harvard Crimson Editors trying to make a quick buck by generating referal fees? Getting into college is about more than copying a good essay.
1,Save your time...,"Although I did not apply to Harvard, as a student at a similarly competitive institution I can tell you that the best way to gain admission is to allow your own ideas to emerge from your application. Pre-packaged substitutes, particularly those written by arrogant Harvard students, will not suffice."
1,Ridiculous,"Once upon a time, The Harvard Crimson, or at least some of the students who worked there, knew something about good writing. But, as this book makes clear, crass commercialism is the favorite pasttime of today's undergraduates. Awful, awful, awful."
3,You'd do better to go back and re-read Barthelme.,"While the one about the guy running over the monkey with the truck is pretty good, the other stories in this collection display a lack of comprehension of even the rudiments of plot and character. The one about the moneky, though..."
5,Helpful to the College Applicant,"Forget the Harvard label; this book will help the college applicant understand what kinds of essays catch the attention of the admissions people at any selective university.A really great feature are the comments and critiques after each essay. Some of the essays seemed odd to me, but after reading the Crimson staff comments, I realized that a certain type of essay succeeds in these circumstances.Frank, useful critiques. A good read for that college applicant.Oh, and after using this, my kid got into a different Ivy League school."
1,stupid letter,I paid six dollars for the stupid letter. I thought that it was the actually game of Law and Order.
4,Good Book,"Probably not the best physics book out on the market, but is one that you will continue to use throught out your physics career. This book contains the basics for college level physics, but describes it in a way that is easy to understand. This book contains enough equations to make your head spin. You might even find yourself saying Mein Kampf during your reading time :}This book aslo contains a few adaptations of your main equations which make it easier to understand the ties between all of the laws of conservation. Overall a good book."
4,Great Knife.,"Here are my thoughts on the Sog Team Leader knife. All in all, I think it is a great knife. There are only two issues that I have with the knife.1. The sheath is leather and with the saw on the back of the blade, every time you pull the knife out, there are pieces of the leather. I am not sure how long the sheath will last.2. The thumb nub (not sure of the correct term), on the back of the blade right before the saw, does not have anything in place to prevent your thumb from slipping onto the saw. I have come close several times to cutting myself on that.All in all, I love the knife. It has a great feel and is very sharp. The handle feels great."
5,Get this one before they are gone....Excellent saw tool,"These are no longer on SOG's website and they look to be discontinued. I got this one and the Duratech for just over $120 for both. The Duratech looks to have gone back up. This one is a great deal and that saw is unbelievable. You will not be dissappointed, other than the saw not sheath friendly."
3,A decent knife,"First, I was disappointed that this was not the Dura Tech model as it incorrectly said in the description when I ordered it. As such, the knife has a great grip that fits my hand amazingly well. And the full tang gives a wonderful solid feel. The saw works well. it's not as long as those cheapo folding saws, so perhaps may be at a disadvantage, although it will hold it's sharpness better. The sheath, as other said, can get chewed up by the saw. I have to slide the knife into it while pressing on the saw-side so it's away from the sheath. and that has solved tghat problem. but still annoying, and gives the impession of lack of attention to detail. At the moment the blade is damaged because I tried to sharpen it with a smith's pocket pal, and that damaged the blade as I think it's at the wrong angle. But before that point it was very sharp."
5,How a computer should be.,"Flawless design. Incredible power. I usually work with almost all the applications running at the same time and I jump between them with no delay at all. It starts up in record time and is the most solid operating system I have used.Only a few minor negatives. The light sensor for screen brightness is in a bad spot and the screen brightness levels can change constantly unless you have good lighting in the room. And when it comes to battery charging, the laptop wont take a charge unless it drops below 94 or 93 %. So I let it drop down below 90% in the morning before I plug it in.Overall if you need a muscular, powerful computer for design and editing I highly suggest purchasing one!"
3,Overheating goodness,I have no complaints except the hot body. The laptop gets up to 100 c while using the processor and it will burn your skin. Overall its a mac get what u paid for
4,Can't help but love a Mac,"I love the large screen. It makes trading stocks much easier as I can watch up to 6 charts at once all while buying and selling stocks. What's so great is that I can not only do this at home, but as long as someone else is driving I can keep trading while running errands around town or on trips. The larger screen is GREAT. The only down side is that the computer still gets hot. Not as hot as the older models, but still bothersome at times. As an investment it has paid for itself already with the profits I've made."
2,Looks cool but massively overpriced,"This is a product that is incredibly overpriced, and simply isn't worth the money. You can buy the same hardware in a computer that is $500-$600 from dell.com Look at the inspiron or business lines to see what I mean. I got my dell computer with 4gb ram, 260gb hd, 15in screen, and a 2.6GHz penryn cpu for $200 less then this. It's simply insane to buy this unless you for some reason, have to have the apple operating system.Apple has created a cult of people who have fallen into the trap of paying for a computer, that although works well, is one that with the same amount of money, you could get a far better computer."
2,Macbook Pro,"Nothing was packed or in original packing, the power adapter having some starches and remote was used. they said it open box but i think if u want the open box better buy it from apple ( refurbish one) they will do better job the amazon."
4,Good Product,"Its an Apple, I expected to give it 5 starts but this has been my most buggy software wise mac since OS9, maybe they are spending too much time on the stupid iPhone, but the current version of the OS has all my internet appps going wacky, and I get Kernel Panics every fricking week. The new LED LCD is very bright, the Battery life is better than older MBPs and its bloody fast and thats with the 2GB of 667 RAM, I wonder what it will do with 4GB of 800 RAM. I m just sorry I could not wait till October to get it with the new OS."
4,I Almost Had to Return Mine,"This is a lovely machine in most respects. I've owned laptops since 1985 and am not easily impressed, but the MacBook Pro elicited my admiration, at least until I tried to connect to my wireless DSL. The internal AirPort card recognized my 2WIRE DSL modem/router, but when I entered my security code, it wouldn't connect. Never had a problem with my Fujitsu Lifebook P2120. I even got a six year old ThinkPad running Windows 98 and a Linksys PCMCIA card to connect. After extensive research, I discovered from online forums that Apple's last software update to the AirPort card makes it impossible to connect with many wireless routers, not just 2WIRE's.I purchased an Airport Express and connected it to my 2WIRE through their ethernet ports and the MacBook now connects wirelessly to the Airport Express without problems. Apple should aprise people about to buy a Mac about this problem."
5,Best Laptop I've Ever Owned,"This is the best computer I have ever owned. Before purchasing this laptop I was concerned about migrating my photos, email, documents etc. from my old Windows machine, but to my surprise, after using the easy setup wizard that automatically found my Linksys wireless router and my home network, I was able to access my old PC and copy all my files over the network. After the easy setup I found I really enjoy using the Leopard OS. It is a very intuitive and user friendly interface. The laptop itself is well designed and very responsive. The keyboard is without a doubt the best laptop keyboard I have ever used."
2,It seems like Apple has some QA issues,"I have just returned the second MBP for defects. First one had couple of keys on keyboard with some scratches and super drive was some what loud. the second one had some issue with mouse cursor freezing up. especially when I'm using photoshop to zoom in and out (or other quick key function), it would freeze and lose control over what I wanted to do.I should have kept the first one if I had know that second one would have more serious issue. anyways, what I have learned is that Apple do not have the best QA and bit disappointed. I'm now without a laptop until Amazon send me a replacement. Hopefully next one will be a decent one."
5,Best Laptop on the Planet,"Apple MacBook Pro MA897LL/A 17"" Notebook PC (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD SuperDrive)I have owned PC towers, desktop and laptops. I have owne Mac towers, desktops and laptops and for my money and needs, this laptop does it all. I am running OS X 10.4.11 and WIN XP Pro both on the same hardware. I am a musician and sound designer and this machine is FAST and stable. Great upgrade from my 17"" Powerbook G4 1.67 GHz machine. The Intel platform runs true Unix and the Rosetta emulation mode is good as well (a little slow but hey, it works)."
2,Bad Keyboard and bad screen,The keyboard on the Macbook pro MA895LL/A is terrible. It lacks proper response. You'll find yourself having to go back and fix what you just typed if you are a fast touch typer. My version also had terrible light bleeding. Its a shame really because every thing else about the computer was really good.
2,Very spicy,This soup is tasty if you like very spicy soup - I didn't care for it but some of my family members liked it.
4,Haynes Repari Manual,"The Haynes Repair Manual although used was in good shape. Like all Haynes Manuals it is very good for people who know how to work on cars. My friend who is not an auto tech but works on cars on the side, used the manual to put a new sensor in my Monte Carlo. Of course, you have to know about cars to begin with but Haynes shows each different cars engine in great detail."
1,Save your money,"This manual was way short on detail on numerous topics. The index had pages noted for a particular process I wanted to do, but yet the instructions (simply, how to change spark plugs on my transverse V-6 powered Chevy Lumina) were NOT THERE. Don't know what else this manual doesn't have, but it's a shame when something so basic isn't covered, and it's even worse when the volume itself indicates it has coverage of the subject when it actually does not. Save your hard-earned dough and sign up for one of those on-line subscription-type manuals."
3,It's alright...,"I think it is a decent manual for the average 'Do-it-yourselfer.Some of the procedures described could use a little more details though.However, it has interesting informations about maintenance etc.The black and white pictures are fairly good.This book is probably a good buy, especially for the price."
3,Don't believe product description...,"Despite the product description...""Hella 005700001 Clear Fog Lamp 550 SeriesProduct DescriptionHella's high quality fog lamps combine incredible performance, rugged off-road durability, and affordability. Designed with your toughest duties in mind, Hella offers black ABS housing, a bonded watertight lens, and an aluminum vapor-coated reflector. Kit Includes: (2) 550 Series Clear Fog Lamps, (2) H3 12V 55W Bulbs, (2) Stone Shields, wiring harness, and complete mounting hardware.""... when I ordered this, amazon only sent me 1 light and no wiring harness... I don't understand the foul up... I am currently working with their customer service to get the complete product as described....The one light I got looks very cool and will be a nice addition to my Jeep... if I ever get the other light... I may end up having to return the one I got if we can't get this cleared up..."
2,listed as Everyday Bible New Century Version w/bonded leather binder,"This was not expensive however the choice I chose suited me,however, the item was listed on amazon as a bible with a bonded leather cover and it was a hardback not as advertised."
5,2 thumbs up!,"Another fantastic movie by Jeanette Oake movie . What a perfect blend of love, family, what it means to work through hard times."
2,Tragic and depressing,I had started to get together with some ladies from church to watch this series from the beginning but this second in the series was too depressing for the women. Now they don't want to watch the rest of the series. They'd rather watch comedies!
3,Same story as all the rest,"Is there one episode of the love comes softly where someone does not die? Die, love repeat. Move on to new spouse."
3,This movie didn't enhance the Pioneer series,This was one of two add-ons to the Janet Oke Pioneer series. I have loved the books and then the videos but adding this as a prequel was not interesting to me nor did I think it enhanced what had already been done well.
3,Character portrayal did not match well,This is one of three remaining in the series that I purchased for my wife for Christmas this year. She is more observant than I but we both agreed that some of the actors chosen to portray characters in later parts of the series do not match up. For example: Missy is too tall and older than she is in Love Comes Softly. Ben and Sarah didn't match up either as Sarah is either blonde or redhead in this one but later she is obviously a brunet. Call it picky if you wish - but that is some of our personal observation. The story itself was good.
5,Good Family Pic!,"If you are a collector of these movies, you will find that this is a good one to add to your collection!"
5,A wonderful beginning,A beginning to the series and I loved every bit of it. I really enjoyed the characters came together and allowed us to see how Missy's family got started.
5,Martin Gordon-Start Here,"Michael C has it right on! Martin Gordon has created a fantastic album! Gordon is a master at crafting hook laden melodies with intelligent funny lyrics. It's a shame this album will probably slip into oblivion. If you like Sparks, Jet or anything else Martin has been involved with, YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD!!!"
5,Very adorable!!,This has very cute illustrations and is exactly what I was looking for! It has pockets to put in souvenirs and hopefully I will have time to fill in everything for my third one due in Feb!
5,Awesome and cute,This book is really organized so you dont have to flip all over the place to find the page you need to fill out and the price is very good!!!!!!!It gives you plenty of room to record stuff to. I wish I would of gotten it for my daughter.
4,nice to browse,"I needed the book for a class and would not have bought it otherwise but, there are some good skills in here."
4,fish fantasy,Certainly a book to start the creative juices flowing. If you love the sea and under sea environment then you will love the ideas and examples displayed in this book. Lovely to look at and full of ideas.
5,"Excellent book, very inspiring, great photos!","I really loved this book -- it's one of my very favorites now. It's easy to read, and the photos are gorgeous. Susan Carlson shows you how to take colorful, textured fabric and turn it into a fabric portait of anything -- from fish, to butterfly, to flowers, people, anything! Her technique is easy. Use templates to cut out fabric, layer it, glue it together, then free style machine quilt over it. Great for embellishing. Then frame and hang your fabric art masterpiece on your wall. Her quilts are vibrant, colorful, rich in texture and detail. Splendid!"
3,For Glue and FISH LOVERS,"The title of this book is very misleading. First and foremost the ONLY technique recommended (or explored) by the author is cutting and GLUING fabric (yes, ""GLUE""). The technique is developed from a combination of foundation and applique quilt methods; hence, the 'free-style' method, is to substitute glue for any and all other peicing methods. In addition, ""No Rules"" is not a 'play-on-words'; her techniques require extensive drafting/drawing, piece numbering etc. . Therefore, exact guides, measured 'seam allowances' (glue overlap allowances) etc., are imperative to her method.Ms. Carlson is a huge fish lover. I, unfortunately, am not. 95% of the examples and 100% of the 'exercises' are of FISH. I had hoped for a wider range of subject matter; or that the book description had included this very relevant fact.All of this being said, the book is very well organized, with lots of color photographs, well written, and true 'hands-on' step by step approach to the author's method.."
4,Fun parachute,"This parachute is a lot of fun for kids. I have been using it with kids mostly 2 and under. The colors are great and it is a good size parachute. It is a little small for making an air-filled bubble over you. It is very durable; the children like to sit on it while the adults hold the edges of the parachute and walk in a circle, spinning them around (on a smooth surface tile floor). It has held up great so far, not a single tear. The handles are also a great feature, especially when the kids decide they want to be the ones lifting the parachute instead of being underneath it."
5,"Great voice, but a better song might be...","I saw this guy open for Skynard. He's like Bob Seger meets Travis Tritt with a BIGGER RANGE.There are two songs I remember from that show. One was a rocker called ""Gone"". the other was a 'real life' song called (I think) ""I Miss My Misspent Youth"". Both were better than this one or the ""Ball"" song, though there's nothing wrong with those. If this whole CD is as good as the show I saw, I'll probably buy it.Kenny"
4,Heard Him live,"I went to a shania twain concert recently where james was the opening act. He is so talented and after hearing him for the first time, i plan on buying his cd. He is a great new artist with lots of potential"
5,Excellent replacement wheel,"Although the lawn mower design allows the plastic wheel inside gear to be stripped, the replacement part is high quality and worth it"
4,Good speakers,"This speaker is Gr8. The full sound is not much like a deck , but it is good as a laptop speaker."
5,blowing away,Received the harmonica in record time. Was just as advertised and the grandkids are liking it.Is a nice way to get them away from the vidio games.
1,Horrible editing,"My heart goes out to this writer on her first effort. Perhaps with some good, professional editing, this book could have been made into a good story, and even been readable. I didn't get through the first paragraph on the first page before I counted 3 editing errors, and they continue throughout the book. If that's not bad enough, the story is disjointed, there is no background on either of the main characters to clue you in on how they got to where they are, and the story is far from believable. Come on, an executive who runs a toy software company AND a contract for hire organization?I would suggest that the writer find a new publisher and gain some new direction in her craft before making another attempt. I sense that she is earnest in her desire to write a good book, but needs much better guidance than she got on this one."
2,Needs some work,"Good things...it was an easy read and I like the Chapter type set.Editing is crucial in order to hold a reader's attention. I almost wanted to get my red pen out and start making changes, but I always sharing my books, so I held off. The constant mental stops for editing are my personal problem.I thought Patty had gotten a new cat. At the beginning it's name was Mandy and then it switched to Fluffy. Continuity of plot line and characters is also good to have...you won't loose the reader.You know...I'd never let Alex Bennett get away with her condescending attitude treating Patty like she had no mind of her own and wasn't capable of doing anything. Granted we all look for a sugar mama, but I think a lesbian must draw the line.I did enjoy it."
5,A great read,I don't normally do reviews of any of the books I have purchased or read but I felt Murder Inc deserved at least a small note. I felt this was a wonderful read. I loved it from beginning to end. I would recommend this book to anyone I know.
5,I love this story,I loved this book. It was a sweet and gentle romance as well as a twisty thriller. I love the main charachters. Alex and Patty are just too wonderful. Alex is really interesting to me. I find her transformation quiet and special. A really well done book. Perfect for summer
1,The Editor Of This Book Should Be FIRED!,"This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. Not necessarily because of the story, but because of the horrible editing. The editing was so bad I couldn't even begin to enjoy the book at all.Example... The first two sentences of the book read exactly as follows (including punctuation, or lack thereof) -""Of all the things Alexandra hated and despised one of the worst things for her to do was shop. To make it even more horrid was that she hated crowds so Christmas shopping was at the top of her list.""I had to read this several times before I truly understood the author's meaning.This book was so bad, I'm not even going to try to give or sell it to someone else. It's going directly into the trash."
3,"Good moral, OK plot.","This story has a very good moral to it, but the plot can get a little boring at times. Watch it on TV before you buy. END"
1,very flimsey,"these suck, they seem very thin & flimsey compared to TDK, also get more failures with these, FYI, try slower burmning speeds for better results, TDK & Verbatim have been the best so far and I have used 1000+"
1,Buy these for your enemies!,"Folks, I go through a LOT of DVDs, and I've tried almost all brands. No problems with Memorex, TDK, Maxell, Sony or Amazon Basic, aside from a very rare bad disc (out of 100). All those brands... all good. Bought all of them here on Amazon, my favorite place to shop.Then, because DVD prices have gone up recently, and these were really cheap, I tried a 100-disc spindle of this Philips brand, and so many discs failed to record, I thought my burner had broken down. It was spitting them out like watermelon seeds at a summer picnic.A conservative estimate would be around 60-70% bad. I finally gave up halfway through the batch and trashed the rest. Like I said, I burn a lot of DVDs, and I've never seen anything like it. Left me in a foul mood and wasted an entire afternoon.Beyond bad. Godawful. Buy them for your worst enemies."
1,Too many coasters!,"Out of 15 attempted so far, had ten coasters in a row. I don't know if this just happens to be a lemon of a spindle or if this is typical of all Philips spindles, but we are extremely unhappy."
1,WHAT I NEED is a little RESPECT....,"These disks were to be used to record Christian programming [for people who are unable to receive the signal]. CDP Outlet sent *DVD disks* that were no longer CLEAN & NON-SCRATCHED! Why?!.. you might ask. If not jokesters, I can only imagine people who do not RESPECT the merchandise & customers. The disks were no longer in its spindle. I got some older & CLEAN SPINDLES and CAREfully selected which I would/could record on... TO THOSE WHO WANT TO KNOW: this is NOT the first time I let CDP know my version of that OLD SONG. I asked them to be careful... but now I ad: all I want is a little RESPECT! IF I should require DVD+/- disks I would purchase from a company that sells TDK or VERBATIM."
2,Two defects along with inadequate packing!,"Two problems here- first, two of the discs were defective, and AGAIN, the plastic container was broken in shipping due to inadequate padding in the carton. I decided that returning it was more trouble than it was worth, but next time this happens, I will return it for certain."
2,"Third try with Philips, Don't like them.",Ten to twelve bad disk per hundred purchased. Will Never use the Philipsproducts again even at the low price.
2,Perfecto,"Llego a tiempo y estuvo mal embalado al cual unos cuantos dvd llegaron estropeado, fueron como 20 y tanto que se dañaron."
2,She's hot,Her constant and out of context references to herself were boring. Ruined the story line. In her opinion every man she saw was after her. Get over yourself and get on with the story. No more Stephanie Chalice for me.
1,Overpriced @ $0.99,"Horrible or should I say hor-rible. Author's decision to exempt himself from the rules of grammar aside, I felt the story was poorly written. Mr. Kelter is on my ""read no more"" list. Save your dollar and get a pack of gum instead. Much more enriching."
2,Too cute for words,"Sorry I did not like this character, if I had to read one more time about the( heroine's) clothing I would have thrown up. I normaly read all the books I select to the bitter end, with this one I couldn't stand one more description - Please - Really - May have had a great ending sorry did not wait to find out."
1,Don't wast you time reading this,"I have to wonder how this book got a high rating. The author needs to decide wether he is writing a thriller or soft porn.The heroine is obsessed with what she is wearing and gets off on men looking at her legs in a skirt. Who cares?? The story line is repetitive and with effective editing, could perhaps be a short story. Don't waste your time reading it."
1,A mustn't read,"This book is terrible. The writing is poor, with irrational jumps in the story, inconsistencies, factual errors and just plain bad English.""He had murdered them all, suffocated each one in the same fashion. Holding each around the waist from behind, he blocked the air from her nose with one hand and her mouth with the other."" Stephanie should have had no problem finding the murderer, just look for a three handed man.In my Kindle version the text still contained hyphens in words that were originally end-of-line split words in the printed version. The publisher obviously thought that it was not worth the small effort it would have taken to edit these out. I heartily agree."
1,Don't close your eyes,This was the most irritating book I have ever tried to read. What is with all the hyphens????? The words are not even at the end of the lines. I changed the font size to see if that would correct the problem but it didn't. I am glad I only paid $.99. I didn't even read to the end of the second chapter.
1,uneducated,"I read this book with high expectations. I was disappointed. I'm from West Virginia. I don't speak in that manner, act that way or think that way. It was offensive to read. The author needs to educate himself."
3,Choppy,"This is an ok book, but the characters need more development. Also, it seems to be going in the direction of a romance novel rather than a murder mystery."
4,First book in the series.,"I really enjoyed this first book about Stephanie Chalice. I found myself laughing out loud several times. Don't get me wrong, it is a thriller and keeps you guessing through out the story."
3,Dont close your eyes,"I am only giving 3 stars to this book as I felt the first half was a bit slow, I almost gave up but I am glad I read it as the second half was good and worth reading.The main character is Stephanie Calice, a NYPD homicide policewoman and while I love to see leading female characters I was disappointed by how she was portrayed. I do not want to give the plot away but ""New York's finest"" did not solve the crime, did not follow up on suspects or even delve into the lives of the victims. She came across as a female sexual predator who was too busy eying up every male character in the book to actually investigate the crimes, find any links or indeed solve the murders.However, I liked the writing style of the author. His characters were excellent, his descriptions were spot on and he knows how to tell a story. For this reason I will read another of his books and hopefully I will enjoy it more."
3,Don't Close Your Eyes,I would have preferred less foul language but it was an interesting read- made me think a bit. I prefer books where the plot is not predictable from the first chapter and this book met that criteria.
4,Fast paced easy to read,"Something to keep you glue to your seat. You'll never guess the outcome. Excellent book. well written, keeps you wondering what else can happen.."
4,Don't Close Your Eyes,"I enjoyed the book enough that I will look for the nexts in the series.It was somewhat predictable , but entertaining , nonetheless."
2,Don't Close Your Eyes,I really thought the story was weakI did not enjoy it at all. The story went nowhere and was very slow
2,I must expect too much....,"At 28, Stephanie Chalice is the top detective in her NYC squad. She is also hot. All of the men around her are hunks. All of them want her. And she's hot. A serial killer is taunting the city. And she's hot. If this seems repetitive, then you have an idea of what this book is like. Murders take a backseat to Stephanie's trials and tribulations as she tries to come to terms with being hot. I can see that a lot of people liked it. But for me, this was a sluggish read with a plot that was given short shrift and a central character that, at many points in the book, I wished had been one of the killer's victims. And oh yeah - she's hot."
2,"Good Story, but...","The story is interesting and pretty well-told, but the main character is totally obsessed with what she's wearing, what people think about what she's wearing, what she thinks about what she's wearing, how she feels about what she's wearing. There are lots of cliches in the book and a couple of misused sayings. The author writes well, but he needed a good editor."
4,Don't Close Your Eyes.,"Just finished reading this book on my Kindle. I am puzzled about the title - guess I must have missed the relevantcy somewhere in the book. While the main character is facinating, I found her to be only semi-likeable and/or believable.The book has more psycho mumbo-jumbo than I like, but the sex with affection is ""normal"", except for the villan's, of course! The ending was unexpected and interesting. Pretty good book."
1,Didn't care for it at all,"I thought I would start reading a new, for me, series but I did not care for this book at all and couldn't wait to finish reading it so I could delete it, guilt - free from my Kindle."
1,The heroine creeped me out.,"I didn't finish this book. The crime seemed interesting, and the writing was vivid. But I hated the heroine. She immediately described herself as ""fine,"" she seemed overly impressed by expensive designer clothing, and she sneered at the insecurities of weaker, less ""fine"" people. Back in the 60s we've described her values as plastic. Today I'd call her shallow with a mean streak. No matter how nice the story or crisp the writing, I don't voluntarily spend time with that sort."
