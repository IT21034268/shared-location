4,Impressive looking watch that keeps fairly accurate time,"When it comes to durability and accuracy, I use my Rolex Date Just. However, when I want some ""flash"", this is it. The gold is a bit soft and scuffs more than a harder metal (eg, stainless or 14k gold), but the scuff marks can be removed easilty by Cartier service. All in all, I'm glad I bought my Cartier Tank Francaise."
3,disappointing,I have enjoyed all of Pepin's cookbooks. This was a little dissapointing in that the varitey of preparations was sadly lacking. In many cases the same dessert is featured one to many times in different chapters with the only difference being a change in fruit. Also a personnel dislike is all the bread used. Bread is nice in some recipes but it seems to be a major focal point here. The book does indeed have simple recipes and the format is lovely but I was expecting more out of Pepin.
5,WORKS IN MY HP 50G CALCULATOR,This SD card works with HP 50g calculator as formated -- I did not format card prior to placing it in calculator. Calculator reports approximately one gigabyte memory but I've read calculator can access all two gigabytes.
4,Does what it says - mixes.,Great little mixer! as usual you can't beat Behringer on price vs. features. My one complaint is that the effects loop is not well documented and have not been able to figure out the correct way to create one.
5,Great for cooling off,I love this little Tracker clip on fan. It is just the right size for caring around to different rooms when I want to get cooled off because I really do sweat a lot.
2,inconsistent readings and un-recoverable hysterises,"Product's mechanical packaging and slick appearance is attractive. It is slim and easy to clean. It also has an adequetly large LCD display, BUT....I had to return the product because it was not giving a consistent and accurate readings.This scale has internal hysterises by up to +/-5 lbs. Every time you place the same weight on it, you would read a different reading.I excercised the ""auto tare"" procedure as it mentioned in the owner's manual, but it did not correct the problem. This product's strain gauge may be sensitive to the changes in ambient temperature and therefore subject to drift. It is known to most scales that there is a small inherent hysterises because of the nature of every strain gauge, but it should be compensated via software or manually. This product was not equipped to do that.I think I should go back to the analog scales with manual adjust for the ""tare"" function"
1,Bad Experience with Gem Avenue.,"I wish, I could have read the Karen's review before I placed my order. I got an intimation after a week that the product is not available.Why are they listing the product if it is not available for delivery ?!I wish I would have given a negative star rating instead of a rating of one star."
5,even better when you get it!,This is a lovely ring- was even prettier when I got it! Has a nice weight and feel to it. I'm glad to add this to my jewelry collection.
3,American Idol....So What!,"Oprah's talent contest did not dissapoint. This CD is well put together with the best songs performed by the most talented singers of the group. Lashell Griffin has a beautiful voice with great vocal range and she can give Whitney a run for her money I believe. But my favorite is Lorenzo Owens...the boy can SING!! I see a bright future ahead for Owens and his lead Temptation soulful voice. The other competitors do well especially Lanesha Baca who is well worth mentioning by name. My only complaint is the song by Joe Herzog.....somehow it just sounds like a bad rendition of a Vince Gill song, not my cup of tea and the only song I skip when given a chance."
5,Talent From the Heart,"What a great, great CD! And what a great opportunity given to these talented ""every-day folks"". I can't imagine that many of them will be not sought after hearing the strong, beautiful voices of these artists! I don't know how many of these performers have any background and/or training in voice and music essons, but their voices sound as though they have spent their lifetime in the music/singing business - very trained, talented and beautiful. There is not one single song on this CD that I just did not get chills listening to. I'm pulling for each one to have some kind of a great future in something they obviously love so well!"
2,NOTE TO OPRAH: Stick to book reviews!,"KARAOKE, KARAOKE, KARAOKE. You'll get more musical satisfaction for your money by going to the local run down bar on Karaoke evening with a carload of friends. The adults on this CD such as Lorenzo Owens shine at times but the overall talent level is far from being notable. OWENS does provide nice vocals to his solo yet does nothing new to make the Stevie Wonder classic shine. JACKIE PERKINS attempts to tackle a DEBORAH COX song and ends up sounding like a discount version of PEBBLES. The sentimental favorite, LASHELL GRIFFIN, does perform a nice mature version of a HOUSTON ballad but the musical arrangement is weak and at best a standard KARAOKE BACK TRACK for the song. JOE HERZOG, LEE McGINNIS and THERESSA RUPPERT are all descent amateurs at best. This CD was a nice concept to generate ratings for the daytime show, but a massive mistake as a recording."
1,"This is a joke, right?","I just noticed this CD on Amazon tonight. Please tell me that Oprah has not jumped on the ""American Idol""-esque bandwagon and now has established her own talent competition. Doesn't Oprah have her hands in enough projects these days? I have nothing against Oprah, personally. I recognize that the only reason she is super-famous is because of all of the haus-fraus that watch her show, buy her magazine, support her book club, and flock to Dr. Phil's franchise as well. If I were in Oprah's shoes, I guess I would milk ""the ignorant"" for all they are worth as well--but come on, Oprah, with your billion-dollar wealth, I think you can afford to pull back just a little. This is a new low even for you."
2,A Feeble Entry In A Familiar Series...,"This one had promise - the female lead is a looker, better than those cast in similiar productions, but her acting was abominable, which I could have easily overlooked IF the movie delivered the goods, which it didn`t. It wasn`t your typical WIP flick,(which would`ve been a good thing to break the mold), but it wasn`t much of anything else either. The box appeared to be an updating of the 'Female Prisoner Scorpion' series, but no such luck. Don`t bother with this one, read my reviews of other similiar flix and pick one you won`t be let down by. Lord knows there are enough of them out there..."
2,2 1/2 stars not a bad watch. Not a must see tho,"This is a Japanese Women in prison (wip) flick with a little supernatural thrown in. Sadistic warden and his corrupt staff of guards torture female prisoners. Our female star gets chained, whipped, beaten in an effort to break her, but she refuses to yield and gains supernatural power.This film does contain topless nudity and a sexual situation (japanese softcore) between a female prisoner and the warden."
5,ND Filter Review,This product is just what I needed. It works as it states and has provided me with a new venture in photography.
4,"Not just a tall, dark and handsome ""rake""","Book aside, did you know that the ""rake"" on the cover is John Gidding, the HGTV host of several shows. I heard that he had posed for romance novels as well a modeled during his college days (studied architecture at Yale) so I thought I would check it out. He is also musical and has received numerous awards while he educated himself. So, not just a rake and a pretty face! Never thought that the covers were paintings of models. Just thought they painted a tall, dark mysterious man and a rebellious pretty woman (change in hair color allowed)!"
3,"Works OK, but custom settings are reset when light is turned off","The motion sensor works OK, and the price is good. There's also a nice feature: if you wire them up to a light switch, then you can force the unit to stay on (even when no motion is present) by briefly turning off the switch for a few seconds. Turn off for 10 seconds to revert to motion detection mode.There is a glitch though: the units have two switches that let you set the sensitivity (low, medium, high) and the duration (30 sec, 1 min, 5 minutes, if I remember correctly). The problem is this: if you turn off the electricity, these custom settings revert back to the default values (sensitive/30 seconds, I think). If you want to change them back, get out the ladder and do some climbing!"
2,Well-Built but doesn't stay put,"The unit is very well built but it it falls off the windshield every 30 minutes or so. No matter what I did to try to get it to stay, it eventually would work its way off."
1,Horrible Software,This software is horrible. It is terribly confusing even regarding how to create directions or to even print a map. Even changing your route is extremely hard and deleting old routes is even harder. This kind of software should be intuitive and easy to use. This software is not.
5,Top Text for Solenoid and Holding Magnet Design,I concur with the other reviews on this book. I bought my copy about 10 years ago when I was looking at a voicecoil project. Now I'm designing a high performance tractive magnet. There is so little out there - you can't beat Rotor's text.
3,Pretty flat but worth it...,"It took me a while to actually ""buy"" this because it wasn't clear what these movies are. When I finally did and watched them I was a little disappointed that most of the music was lip-synched and there was hardly any steel guitar playing which I was looking forward to. All in all these areprimarily fun and silly Vaudeville revival acts strung together with a thin ""back-stage"" plot. My favorite was the Spade Cooley one with Richard Lane."
5,BEST PRIMER ON THE MIDDLE EAST,"Although first published twenty years ago, this extended essay by an Iranian author and journalist remains the best primer on the comnplex politics of the Middle East. Here, we are really taken behind the headlines to learn about what matters in a region afflicted for generations by poverty, conflict , tyranny and war."
2,Korean Version,"As the previous reviewer, Jarrett ""2cC,"" has warned, the American version of this film by Fox is not the version to view or purchase. Instead, you can currently obtain the blu-ray Korean director's cut from yesasia.com, complete with the director's commentary."
5,Best Dog Bed Yet!,"I have a 6-year old English Mastiff, and he LOVES this bed. Previously he had a bumper bed, which he liked well enough, but this one is ten times better. He loves resting his head on the bolster, and the bed is big enough for him to stretch and spread out comfortably. He used to have a favorite armchair to sleep in that he would sneak onto at night, but he doesn't even bother anymore with this bed!The bed is easy to wash as the cover can be unzipped and the cushion+egg crate removed. The one complaint I have is that it takes some effort to get the egg crate back into the cover (this is probably only an issue with the extra large version of the bed). Even so, I still give it top marks!"
3,"Not bad, but not great.","I got this dog bed for my great dane (an 8 month old puppy) so he could have something nice for in his xxl cage (which I also got off of amazon). The dimensions of this dog bed are perfect and it fits nicely in his huge crate. However, I do agree with the review that said the padding on the bottom is a bit thin. There really isn't much cushion to it and for that I give it a 3-star rating. It's ok, but not great quality, which I think the price reflects. Its ok for his cage but I am considering getting him a more quality bed from a different store for the downstairs of the house. It does it's job, but it's not fantastic in any way. I'm not upset I spent the money on it, but I will invest in a higher quality bed next time. We'll see how long this lasts."
5,Great buy,"This bed for my dog is a wonderful buy, lots of room for her to stretch out, and she has arthritis. I really think she likes this, she took right to it, loves to prop up her head, the bolster around it gives her lots of places to prop up!"
4,Not a Sajen fan but love these,"Usually I am not a Sajen fan (just a personal prefernece as I don't like the rhodium finish on the silver) but the combination of the garnet and the moonstone are beautiful The garnet is indeed dark but catches the light nicely. My main problem with them is that the wire is almost too light-weight and when I push it to the side to hook it in the back, I fear over time it will be damaged."
3,Moonstone Earrings by Sajen,"Nice size and design earrings. The garnet stones, however, lack color and luster. Not the usual quality for Sajen."
4,Sturdy and very pretty,"this trellis comes in pieces but is very easy to assemble. It is very sturdy and a very lovely design especially with the finials at the top of each upright rail. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because if you want to use it in an open area as opposed to next to your house, there doesn't seem to be a good way to secure it other than to bury about 1/3 of it in the ground and even then I am not so sure it would hold up against a strong wind such as where I live. So, even though I have no plans to plant anything up next to the house, I have stood it up against a big blank brick wall and it makes for a lovely decoration until I figure out a way to secure it, without having to bury half of it, in the open area where I originally intended for it to go."
4,Great Trellis,"This is a tall white Trellis that looks great, It should be fastened to a structure though, ours is screwed to our shed for over a year and hasn't moved, it does have to be assembled, which was quick and easy."
1,Not as Pictured,This paddle was not as pictured. It has a rounded paddle end instead of what the picture suggests. I was very disappointed.
5,Nice Cookbook,We sometimes receive a gift of Venison from our hunter friends and I am always looking for tasty ways to prepare it. This book has a very nice selection of just such ideas.
5,"You name it, it's got it!","If you are lucky enough to be able to put some venison in the Freezer, this book is a must. There are recipes for every occasiion as well as many, many new thoughts for preparation. I had been looking for the ""fool proof"" roast recipe and the author says that it is not just me that has a problem. Solutions are offered while acknowledging that ""roasts are challenging"".The book is a must for the sportsmen's library"
4,Wonderful!,"If you are interested in falconry at all, this is a MUST READ! The story takes you from the hack site to the beaches of Texas. I ordered this book for my boyfriend (now husband!) many years ago based on a review that I read in Sports Illustrated. I recently read it again and it was better the second time around (maybe because I know more about falcons, falconry and especially falconers than I did before!). It is a great story, it wont take you long to read and anyone who has ever loved a bird and let it go will really appreciate it!"
4,Another fun trip with an old friend,"Mrs. Pollifax is at it again. This time, helping Farrell, she travels to Jordan to get a manuscript. Of course, her trip couldn't be that uneventful. She soon finds herself involved in not one, but two cases of international intrige. Can she find her way out of both of them?This book really felt like coming back to an old friend. The relationship between Farrell and Mrs. P. is wonderful as always. I really do wish that we would see more of Cyrus, however. The new characters are interesting and entertaining. The plot was entertaining and kept me confused about several things until the very end. It was good escapist fun, exactly what it tries to be. If you aren't familiar with the antics of the CIA's secret weapon, buy a copy now. You won't regret it."
5,earth dreaming forever,i found this vhs tape in the late 1980's at a pharmacy department store and i still have it. i was a happy camper because i do have this steve roach cd based on this tape. incredible photography and music. it's like hand and glove. it is worth buying on vhs or dvd.
2,About what I expected for 10 bucks.,"Do I recommend it? Only if you are really into the paranormal and collect as much as possible on ghosts. Not very high quality, but for 10 dollars, I am glad to own it."
3,Not Bad for the Price (which you cannot beat),"No, it's definitely NOT ""Ghost Hunters""--but it's entertaining enough for a rainy, lazy day on the couch or Halloweentime. For the price (which is unbeatable)--I think it's great."
1,What's in It,"Not much info about this, Amazon seems to list it as color. Are these the PD shorts colorised, plus newly colorised WC Fields shorts??? The product cover (and Timeless Media website) have no info about the contents at all"
2,Dry documentary,"""Hauntings in America"" is a lacklustre documentary that portrays places in America that have the distinction of being the most haunted. Though the places covered are interesting [the usual suspects, i.e. Gettysburg, old Hollywood stars' mansions etc], the presentation style is uninspired and the eyewitness interviews are rather tepid.This is worth watching to gain some insights into hauntings of famous places in America, but if you're interested in real-life hauntings, then I'd recommend ""A Haunting"", a show that airs on the Discovery Channel and focuses on reenacting [with great acting] supernatural occurrences in different homes across America. I think Seasons 1-3 are available on DVD."
4,Not too shabby,"Hauntings in America isn't bad to watch, actually I watched this one Sunday morning when I was bored and it covered alot of Hollywood deaths and sightings of Movie stars. Also it has eye witnesses to everyday people's ghost sightings. This isn't nearly as good as Unsolved Mysterties or A Haunting but on a boring Sunday morning it was pretty good to watch."
3,Hauntings in America,"I liked it, I use to watch it around Holloween in the Trave Channel, now I have and can watch on a Sunday its cool."
1,Very Poor CCG,"As a huge magic AND a huge WoW fan, I looked all over for this game thinking it would be the best of both worlds...unfortunately, it's the worst of both.Beware the HUGE imbalance of hero cards/decks in this game. It's obvious that the game was not properly put through its paces before it was run out the door. Upper Deck should be ashamed of the poor play-balancing.Outside of that complaint (which makes the game itself useless), the art is so-so compared to other CCGs and the rule-book absolutely ABYSMAL.Do yourself a favor and purchase a properly put-together CCG (I don't care which one you choose, just choose something other than Heroes of Azeroth)."
3,Not as fun as I thought,"This item was not as fun as I thought it would be, there is really no one in my area who participates in this type of game.Ronna C."
2,False Name,"I bought this thinking that it was actually contain a starter deck, like around 50-60 cards from the original TCG. Got it in the mail and noticed it was just one starter pack that had about 10 cards in it and were all extremely common and had many duplicates. Unless I was the only one that was ripped off buy this and paying around 15$ for it, do not waste your money."
5,The Best,"This is quite simply the highest quality filter you might need. If you spend $2,000 on glass, you want to protect it and you don't want distortion of any nature. This accomplishes both."
5,Great filter,"Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but in life you pay for quality. This is a great polarizing filter, made of high quality glass by a company you know you can trust. If you're considering buying it, you should definitely do so."
5,Kaesemann CP Filter,"Wow. This is unbelievable. What a quality product. Even the box it is packaged in seems of higher quality. The filter itself is weighty, and the glass is perfect. It threads on like its made of silk. I know it's expensive, but invest in quality, not repurchasing, something I learned long ago and has been reinforced since. I have a few cheap filters from our initial digital SLR investment and there is no sense in comparing, the difference is readily apparent, both in photographs and obvious quality. I will never again buy any other brand of filter than B+W. I save until I can afford to purchase the best item available, and there isn't anything out there better than this CP filter. This is my fourth B+W filter purchase, equal in price to a non L lense purchase but worth every penny. You get what you pay for."
1,Corner vignetting at wide angles (24mm),"I bought this polarizer for my new Canon 5D Mark III with a 24-105mm EF lens. I took some outside shots and realized upon editing them that there is marginal--but very discernible--vignetting on all four corners. This might be okay for some who want to take casual shots or shoot at greater focal lengths. I intend to take a lot of landscapes (hence the polarizer), which often means the widest angle I can get. I returned this product. I hope to get a slim filter in its place, and hope this fixes the problem. (Note: I attached the polarizer directly to the lens... no UV, no other filter stacking.)"
4,Can't see much difference,This is a quality built product Don't see a great deal of change when rotated. That may be on me.
3,works,"This filter is very nice, but mine came with a smudge on it! hard to clean. Not sure if it is worth the extra money."
3,Work ok but I believe its over priced,"I'm not a expert photographer but I do have many years of experience with Cirucular Polarizers with my SLR's. I know how to use them and which brands are crap. When I got my Canon T2i everyone recommend this filter. This is one of the few brands I am not familiar with. The price is pretty high but with such high reviews I thought I would give it a try. Well after a full day of testing it I can say it works just as well as many lower priced C.P.'s, but I really didn't get the wow factor I was expecting. The general colors in my pictures looked good but really no better then other filters I've used in the past. This filter is constructed very well but in my opinion I think that is all you are paying for. I'm sure many will disagree with me, but in my option start with a cheaper filter and if you feel the need then upgrade to this."
4,"Good, but not the best","Well, I am a big fan of the polarizer filters and the wonderful effects it delivers. I was pretty impressed with all the reviews I read about this one, I got a bit exited and decided to go for it. It is good for sure, but I still prefer the Nikon CPII - it is a lot thinner and has a better result in my opinion."
1,B+W Polarizer,"A beautifully made product but complete blows auto focusing on Panasonic GX1, GF3, and G3 cameras with Panasonic 45-175 and 100-300 teles at the long end of the zoom range.The problem exists in all focus modes except in IA mode. So it may be a firmware issue. I will try a Panasonic polarizer and report."
1,Poor Amazon Handling....,"Just having received this filter without opportunity to use it yet, it was extremely annoying to find it previously opened and heavily smudged on both sides.Needing to painstakingly clean my new purchase is ridiculous. I'll live (...lol..) but come on!I assume this filter will perform well but this is my only chance to express my irritation so it gets a one."
2,Threading Problems,"I bought a B+W KSM Polarized Circular filter and threaded to the B+W UV filter and couldn't get them apart. In addition, the UV filter wouldn't properly thread to my new Canon 18-135mm EFS lens."
3,Label Slaves Unite...,"people talk about market share, time-to-market, competitive advantage. blah blah blah. why do 19 of 22 brands from 1925 still exist today, after 75 years? 'cause we identify with them. Sprin't needle drop is far more important to its success as a business than the lackluster coverage of it's PCS network. This book is a nice bedside read for the folks who're tired of FastCompany and B2.0 and wonder what the cultural aspect of brand making enatils. While you may want to think that Esther Dyson has something interesting to say about branding today, this book is The Real Thing(TM) for delivering interesting comments on how brands have become so much part of our cultural identity."
2,Eh...,"Gives a very generalized, even boring, view of some dog breeds.I, myself, could have added to the information in here.Its definitely not ALL about dogs."
4,great free kindle book,If you love to read about dogs it was a good book. I was glad to get it for free from kindle.
3,Disappointing,"I only learned of Douglas Englebart recently, and was impressed. I could have gone to Stanford in the late 60s, and who knows how my life might have been changed if I had met him? His vision that the computer should not be a partner but an intellectual prosthesis was fascinating to me, since I had sort of figured that out in the 1970s myself, but I never articulated it. I appreciated this book's description of his campaign to promulgate this idea. It was also interesting to discover that over time, his group was subject to the same sorts of political and personal problems that Information Technology groups have been suffering from ever since.The problem is that the author made it very difficult to see the story. The writing style was very difficult to follow, with way too many details not really packaged in a meaningful way. There was a really interesting story hiding in there, but you had to work much too hard to find it."
4,Decent,"Can't beat the price, that's for certain. However, although packaged well, one arrived broken. I received my money back for the bulb, which is good because I didn't want to crawl up to the roof and replace another bulb. It was brighter than I expected for only being 5W, but I guess that's attributed to the color and opacity. I plan on purchasing more colors from these guys later on this year -- definitely worth it."
5,Nice to find some C-9's in yellow!,I'm glad to find this type of lightbulb (the C-9 size) in yellow. And the price was very good too! Totally worth it!
5,Worked Beautifully,this ignition kit is as-advertised. Highly recommend if you want to update your old and possibly weak ignition. Install took a little time but I am impressed with the results. My old porsche engine just sounds and feels better- no more shaking!
1,Missing part :(,"Would have worked great but it was missing a bracket, not sure if it was Amazon's fault or Crane's. Unfortunately out of business now and you cant get these parts anymore. Got a full refund, so it's OK"
5,Utterly Charming,"I recently read this book and found it utterly charming. It was the first work by Pratchett I read that was not a Diskworld novel. I found the same dry wit and wonderful humor in The Bromeliad. It was written for younger readers, and like all good juvenile fiction, it is a story that is told on several levels--easy enough for young readers, but compelling enough for adults.The story is about a family of ""nomes"" who meet a large population of nomes living in a department store, which they believe to be the whole world. Adventures follow, and the hero must struggle against ""nomish nature"" as much as against the wide world. Of course, like most good fantasy, there are plenty of parallels to real life, but the author doesn't need to hit the reader over the head with them. As for the title, a bromelaid is a flower that grows in the rain forest. How is that related to 4 inch high people in England? Read the book to see how the author ties it all together."
4,My Review of Q,"I know this magazine from buying at various newstands. Since ordering from Amazon, I have not recieved any issues to date, therefore my review cannot be made. Thank you, and thanks for your support."
2,"good, but not worth the price","First of all, I like this magazine. Q really is the best music-themed magazine out there. But with only 12 issues a year, 120 bucks is way too expensive. I think you will be disappointed if you spend this much on it (well, on any magazine, for that matter)."
5,Best Product for my headaches....,"Percogesic is a wonderful product for someone that suffers with bad headaches. I've used this product for years, but now can't find it in stores."
5,Percogesic,This is the only medicine that I can find that helps my pain and allergies. Hard to find in the stores I would recommend it.
5,Beautifully Delicate Yet Sturdy!,"This bracelet is exactly as described by the seller. It's even more impressive in person. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. It's sturdy enough for even the most active person, yet delicate enough to wear on special occasions. Any lover of jade jewelry will absolutely fall in love with this one. I recommend this buy highly."
2,"Hey, don't constantly try to convince me of boost - just teach it to me!","Lets distinguish: Boost is great, but this book is just not well written.It is technically shallow, it is exhausting and boring to read and the authors attitude seems arrogant and is nerving.I wouldn't buy this book again but recommend working through the docs on the boost website which are way better."
2,Love Boost but not this book,This book doesn't add any value over reading the documentation that comes with Boost (and some of the Boost documentation is really terse). It fails to explain concepts clearly and there are almost no diagrams.
2,limited usefulness,"This book only covers a small part of the Boost libraries. Every time I search for what I need, I find that it's not discussed in this book. For example, the Boost Graph Library and many others."
4,Info for W Boudville,"Pardon the interruption, but for reviewer W Boudville and anyone else who is looking for information on boost.graph, there is an entire book on the subject. See _The Boost Graph Library_ by Siek, Lee, and Lumsdaine.For what it's worth... at this point, as portions of Boost are being adopted into the C++ TR1 standard, any C++ programmer should make an effort to become familiar with the Boost library. I will be picking up this book (and will review it further then), but for now my four star rating belongs to the Boost libraries themselves."
1,"Misleading description, horrible post-sale service","According to the description, this product should be compatible with my Garmin GPS. It was not. ANTOnline does not accept returns."
1,Not for the eTrex series,"Please be aware of an important issue with this cable, even though it is recommended for the eTrex GPS series it will not fit their flat 4 pin connector.I had to return mine and bought one at the local REI"
1,Wrong cable,When I bought the etrex I was prompted to buy this interface cable. Of course it was the wrong one.
2,Not thinking,I ordered this product because it came with the drivers for a MAC. The drivers came in on a micro disk. MAC has never offered the ability to read micro disks. They have had the self loading drives for years. I am now wondering if the drivers are even for a MAC. The product has sat on my desk for a month and I doubt I will ever get to use it. What a waste.
1,Pathethic service,"this seller is absolutely useless. i have made many requests in trying getting my refund back however, none was received. Bad communication to customers.Please be aware when purchasing anything from these traiters."
5,"I read the book but I didn't see the movie, but I want to.","My friends and all think that this was one of the coolest books. Especialy because it had to do with tenagers like my friends and I. My friends and I usually don't love books at much as we love this book, and to us it feels kinda weird cause we normaly don't like books."
3,Help save this movie!,"Everyone, please, have your local elementary school's fourth grade class write a letter to Mr. Coppola requesting that he release ""The Outsiders - The Complete Novel (This time I did it right - Two-Disc Special Edition)"" by editing the original music score back into the movie. Make sure they emphasize the importance of this by saying such things like ""Carmine's music used to be the only thing that would calm my daddy down when he was on one of his drunken binges. Now he just beats me to settle his nerves. Thanks Mr. Coppola."" Also, have them add that the poor consumers that purchased the most recent version should be entitled to some sort of compensation when this new release comes out, say $5 off with proof of purchase. Thank you and godspeed."
5,Great for teens and adults alike,S.E. Hinton's wonderful novel of teen angst is well done here. Her uncanny talent for capturing true teen spirit and their painful caste system will touch adults and kids alike.
3,It was good.,"Though the movie isn't as good as the book, it was great to see all those familiar 80's actors together on one screen. Before you watch the movie, read the book. You get so much more depth of character in the reading whereas the movie is the bare bones. Otherwise, not a bad movie."
2,This movie is nothing like the book,This movie stunk compared to book. There were alot of things that were different from the book and the acting was terrible. It has some famous actors that are famous now but they were in there early years. If you have read the book then don't watch the video. If haven't read the book then get it!
4,Outsiders,"My granddaughter read this for a class assignment. The school no longer supplies the required reading, so we had to purchase the book. We bought the kindle version, which was convenient for her. She liked the book well enough; after reading it she then had to watch the movie. Because she read the book first she understood the movie better."
3,Missing part of the movie,"This copy of The Outsiders is missing the entire first chapter of the book where Ponyboy gets jumped. It's an essential part of the movie. This version starts when Johnny and Ponyboy meet Dallas at the store (chapter 2 in the book). The seller was great, the product was in good condition, it is just missing part of the story, which is important."
5,grease for peace,"Before they had guns they fought with guts. If street brawls, petty theft, and switch blades spark your intrest, then the OUTSIDERS is a must have movie. Outsiders is a classic motion picture between the greaser's and the soc's! If you haven't seen it. . .watch it, if you don't own it. . .BUY iT!"
3,The Outsiders movie,"The main actors played real good in the movie. I was able to know each character's personality and how they act. Maybe Cherry would have been better if she reacted more. The plot of the book was set really organized. It had the same beginning, rising, climax, falling action and resolution at the end like the book. The setting was good but it would have been better if they made the houses and settings more unique. It didn't really show how the Socs lived. But I pretty much agreed with how the setting was represented, It matched about 75% the world that I had imagined while reading S.E. Hinton's book. Some were too realistic in the movie but others matched a lot. The movie sort of discussed the main themes of the book. Many events happened after another that I got a little confused about the main theme. I liked the book better because it make me understand more and stay with my own imagination of the story because some things were different than how I had imagined."
2,book vs movie,"I give the movie 2 and a half star, because it wasn't so good. Many things were not explained and you got confused sometimes. I only knew what they were talking about because of the book. The main actors were good, they did a nice job, but the movie wasn't planned to good. The plot and setting in the book were very good, we knew were they were, and in the movie, we just saw places, not names, well, only like Dairy Queen and like that. I actually imagined the setting and characters a little bit different. For example, the church I imagined it like in a hill, and taller. I was kind of disappointed with the movie. The mayor themes in the book were descriptive and they explained everything that was happening at that moment. The book is much better than the movie. In the book everything is explained and you don't really have questions about what is happening. In the movie everything passes to quick, and you get confused really easily."
5,Excellent Version,"The DVD version is much better. I liked the additions of the Elvis music as well. Even though the scenes were the same, the music made the movie seem different in a good way."
5,Great movie!,"I really enjoyed this movie and also read the book too. This is a must for those who had read the book and would like to see this moive. With hot young stars C.Thomas Howell, Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze,Leif Garrett, Ralph Macchio,etc. Wow! You have got to see it for your self."
2,Book was good but the movie wasn't that good,"Well, I thought the book was really great, but the movie? Basically, it sucked. The actors were hot, but even though now they are all pretty good actors, back then they sucked. They could have tried a little harder. The directors and stuff could have made the movie a little closer to the book. I think they should have either put more effort into the movie or else just not have made the movie."
2,Great movie ruined by added music,"This is one of my favorite movies and I was excited that there was added footage to this Complete Novel. I saw some reviews of people not liking the music that was added, but thought, 'how bad can it be'? It was HORRIBLE and really ruined the movie for me. Even though the extra footage is great and some was definately needed in the original, I would still recommend getting the original version.The music often doesn't fit with what is going on in the movie and ruins the feel as to what is happening. More times than I could count there was music with words being played at the same time that dialogue was happening and it was very difficult to hear the dialogue and the music drowned out the scenes. So much new music was added that it seems like there is not much of the movie anymore without annoying music happening.The extra disk and special features is interesting, but I would still recommend getting the original version of the movie."
4,out-standing-siders,"This is an outstanding movie. One of the greats from a long time back. Comes highly recommended. It is a classic tale of street kid gang vs. rich boy preps. Goes deep into the lifestyle of old time country life, before groups of kids became killer gangbangers. Like the book, the movie is phenominal. It is great to see all of those actors together in such a memorable film."
2,New Soundtrack Ruins it,"Being that The Outsiders is my favorite all time movie, i have been looking foward to geting the complete novel for weeks. Well im watching it now, the Rumble scene is on, and what i see is an awesome scene with Surfing Music playing behind it. Its horrendous. Almost none of the original score is in this DVD. Now it is awesome to see the extra footage and all, that part is great, but often times the new score practicly drowns out the Dialouge. And what is with all of the Elvis?"
5,The Most Touching Movie Ever,"When I was told to read this book for English class, I thought that it sounded extremely boring. Boy, was I wrong! I read it over, and over, and over again until I finally bought the DVD and book. The movie is great!!! I must say, Ralph Macchio is the actor to make the movie great. He WAS Johnny! When I read the book, I cried when Ponyboy finds the letter from Johnny, and I did the same thing in the movie, but it was so much more touching when you hear the music at the end. ""Stay Gold"" fits in with the theme so well! And the scene in the backround... The first thing I thought when I finished the book was ""This needs to be made into a movie!"" I was so happy when I realized that it was already made; I didn't have to wait!"
3,New Soundtrack destroyed this movie,This was one of my favorite movies - and Coppola changing his father's hauntingly beautiful soundtrack made me feel like I wasted my money. Much preferred the original version.
2,NOT WHAT WAS ADVERTISED,I bought this DVD because it was supposed to have the extra footage that was originally deleted from the movie. It wasn't there. The quality of the dvd also seemed to be lacking. Not sure if it's because it was an old movie or if it is this particular DVD.
3,book beats movie,"I saw this movie after having read the book and it was incredibly dissapointing. I expected it to be good since Francis Ford Coppola directed it, yet the acting just turned out so bad that I couldn't help laughing even at the most serious of scenes. Maybe I feel this way because I read the book first. I have friends who saw the movie before they read it, and really liked it. I do not recommend it if you liked the book."
4,Forever A Classic!,"I was absolutely thrilled with this new edition of the movie. I enjoyed watching the new scenes, and the features with the cast was fun to view. However, the only thing I really didn't like was the new music score that was added. I think it detracted from the movie in many ways. I didn't like BLUE MOON playing when Johnny was talking to Ponyboy, for example, about having no place in the world and wanting to kill himself. I think the music pulled us away from the emotion and power of the scene, almost making it comical when that was so poignent to the character and his actions later. I found this to be true in other circumstances. Even so, this movie is a classic and having the new scenes just adds to it forever being timeless."
1,the outsiders aka grease party bingo,"coppola joins the ranks of tired directors ruining their classic work with his update of the outsiders. i couldn't even sit through the ""complete novel"" because of the replacement of the original soundtrack with now campy period surfrock. talk about zapping dramatic tension, the new music is so bad i thought frankie and dee dee were going to jump off the drive-in screen to save pony from being drowned.i ended up turning off the dvd to dig out my pan and scan vhs copy.sure the extras are nice but the ""new"" material is expostional, awkward, and for the most part unnecessary. if a director wants to show us their ""intended"" version of the film that's fine but either include it on a separate disc or make it a selectable feature that the viewer can turn OFF. i don't know how many times i've rented or bought a dvd only to find it's not the classic i paid for."
2,This Is NOT The Movie You Remember,"Here's what's good about the two-disc set: The SECOND DISK. All of the extras are top-notch. The commentary tracks on disk one (the movie) are fine. Some of the re-inserted deleted scenes are a nice addition, too. But you know what? All of that is overshadowed by the new soundtrack, which completely devistates the movie.You want a lesson in how important music is to a movie, play this cut side-by-side with the original.It is terrible what Coppola's done to the score. He turned what used to be a dark, moody film into a light-hearted romp full of loud, boring surfer music and inappropriately-placed Elvis tunes. The only reason I can see for doing this is if he wanted to create a ""kiddie cut"" that isn't scary for children. The problem with that is that I saw ""The Outsiders"" as a child and it was powerful. It was cool, sad, beautiful and really spoke to my teenie kid mind about classism and justice.Now it looks like a ""Simpsons"" parody of itself."
1,Ms. E thinks it stinks!,The world that S.E. Hinton has created in her classic first novel is completely lost to bad acting and an awful script! Yuck!!
1,How could acting be this bad?,"The book by S.E. Hinton was excellent and very well developed. The movie, however lacked tremendously. I can't understand how such big stars could use their acting skils so poorly! Don't watch this movie!"
3,What a classic!,"I loved the Outsiders when it first came out - it is so campy, but it is truly a classic movie. The cast is simply amazing, with a lot of future heavy hitters. The special features on this DVD are truly amazing, and long overdue!Now, the reason why I did not give this DVD five stars - the music! Why did Coppola get rid of the beautiful score from the original movie and replace it with that god-awful music? Perhaps that music worked in a FEW scenes, but for the most part, it really tended to minimize some of the more dramatic parts in the movie. The new music did not work for me at all."
3,The Outsiders,"I personally thought that them movie was disappointing. The book was so much better. The movie doesn't explain what the Curtis brother's life is like. Small details like what color somebody's hair is, do not bother me. But taking events from the book that effect other events. Make the movie very hard to pay attention to. Although the newer version of the movie with the deleted scenes is a very good movie, I enjoyed it very much. The newer version includes the events that were not in the original movie.Sean L."
3,Outsiders,The Outsiders was a great story as a book. But i think the director did a crappy job. We read the book and class and i could relate to it because i am 14. The movie strays away from the book alot. It jumps around alot. The movie is like a 4 year old that got ahold of to much sugar. The plot of the movie jumped around way to much.
2,Surprised this is Coppola.,Character development was weak. It was cool to see all those stars so young and whomever cast the film did an amazing job. As far as Coppola I can't believe this is the same guy that did the Godfather. Pretty shocking because I think Godfather 1&2 are some of the best films ever made. What happened?
4,Different but good,"This movie is more true to the book. I have to admit, all the music being played during most of the scenes was a bit distracting. It took me some time to get used to that. I've seen the original around 25 times, so the whole thing seemed a bit bizarre at first. Definately worth watching, lots of good behind the scenes stuff too."
3,book is 10x better,"this is a pretty good movie, with a great young cast, who mostly all went on to big movie careers. Yet, it doesn't hold a candle to the S.E. Hinton classic..."
5,This video is AWESOME it really kicks some bUTT,i was assigned to read this book over the summer along with 4 others so i was really bummed out. i read this one third and i started reading it at about 9:00 and finished about 2:00 in the morning i didnt wanna put it down. what i like best is that theres never a time when your so bored reading it. the plot is great. The next day i rented the movie and i will buy it one i get some money! anyway read the book first cuz then youll understand the movie better!~!!
5,Mr.Coppola has captured the 60's in Oklahoma.,"I grew up in Enid,Oklahoma in the 60's. I never read ""The Outsiders"" but have read ""That was then, this is Now"" by S.E. Hinton. I saw ""The Outsiders"" a few years ago and since then watch the movie now and then. I've always been impressed by Mr. Coppola's talent in capturing a period in time which I so well recognize. From the very beginning he captures the sunlight I remember so well, the freight trains tooting their horns at night (those sounds I heard every night going to bed), the drive-in movies with high school kids sneaking in by hiding in the trunk, the Dairy Queens where one got a cherry coke, and so much other details. Many others might find this movie boring, but having come from Oklahoma myself this movie takes me back to a time when I was small. Thats the wonderful things about movies. When one sees something that captures a time and place. Thank you Mr. Coppola for that. Stay Gold!"
5,This movie was excellent,"I have read both the book and seen the movie. Yes the book was better but simply because there was more detail and teh end seemed more complete. For someone who has never read teh book, this movie would be excellent. The acting might not be what people expect but the emotions get across just fine and i found I felt a strong connection to the characters. So overall this movie was amazing."
4,Simple and Solid,"This is a good movie where they stuck a whole bunch of would be stars into a plot that could only be described as simple but solid. Amazing actors like Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, Rob Low (who is making an amazing comeback), Ralph Macchio, Emilio Estevez, and C. Thomas Howell (who is one of the most underrated actors in the business today) explode on the screen. The best part about this movie is that they made a Hollywood-friendly movie and they didn't kill the whole essence of the orginal book. It's a great movie."
5,Terrific movie.,I`ve read the book and seen the movie and both of them really reached out and touched me.I felt like I could kind of relate to the characters well because I am a teenager like Ponyboy.This is one of my favorite movies and books of all time.
3,new score meh old score epic!,I have loved this movie since the age of 6 .I watched every day and pretended that i was dally running around my neighborhood.The new version is awesome because of the new scenes i had never seen but crappy cuz I hate the new score.The original score was epic the awesome music when dally is running from the cops still gets me a lump in my throat and the tribal rumble music was also perfect i hope they release a blu ray with different soundtrack options.
2,"The movie is still great, but............................","For those of you who know this movie in and out like myself you will pick up on the differences right away. The music. Too much. Way too much. The added scenes are great. But when Johnny and Ponyboy are in the lot late at night and Johnny is talking about going to somewhere without greasers and soc's and the background music is ""Blue Moon,"" that was it. I shut it off and I will probably never watch the DVD again. Waste of money. They ruined a great movie by adding music so loud that it drowns out the voices at times. Buy the original not the remastered version. Trust me."
5,I think it is an awsome movie and that everybody likes it.,I think that Matt Dylan is the most hottest and cutest of all the actors in the movie the Outsiders.
1,WHAT A LETDOWN!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!,"If you think this would enhance the beautiful original version, you're so wrong!!! The score is HORRIBLE and inappropriate not to mention the poor timing! Gone are all those beautiful ballad that balanced the movie. For instance, Dallas' death was quickly followed by an upbeat rock & roll number! What's THAT all about??? And the ending where Soda Pop ran away just to give a lectue to Darryl and Pony is just sooo out of character! Seeing the movie in its uncut version (and its HORRIBLE SCORE!!!) simply gives a valid reason why they were cut to begin with AND gave me the impression that Pony is some sort of a girl! There were simply waaaaaaay tooooooo much crying by the greasers! Even Two-Bit cried????? C'mon... I paid big bucks to archive one of the best movies from Coppola and what did I get??? Absolute LET DOWN!!!!!"
4,"Perfect, except for the obnoxious music","This DVD set has everything you could want, as others have said. But, I must agree with everyone who was dissapointed with the musical score. I thought it was terrible! Surf music when Ponyboy and Johnny are struggling with the Soc's? The same stupid music plays in ever ""action"" scene and it is way too lighthearted for this film. Sometimes the music is so loud you miss out on dialogue. I love Elvis, but his music sounds so corny and obvious when they arrive at the church and in other scenes. Why did Coppola have to mess with the music? Who knows, but this DVD set is still worth it's weight in gold for any Outsiders fans."
1,GREAT MOVIE RUINED!!!!!!!!,"Please watch the original if you have never seeen this film. The added footage is good, but the new soundtrack / score destroys a classic. Elvis' Sun Sessions (1954) are great on their own but here along with the other new tracks they are distrscting, sometimes plain silly, innapropriate (story takes place mid-sixties), and at times they completely drown out the dialog altogether. I think FFC either had nothing to do with it or has lost his mind. I look forward to him scoring the Jonas Brothers over Apacalypse Now. Awful!!!!!"
3,musical curse,"A great dvd package, but the elvis music ruins climatic scenes, carmine coppolas' original score was perfect."
3,Fun but not very good,"The Bottom Line:With its homoerotic scenes of pretty boys bonding and fighting, West Side Story style gangs, and decidedly old-fashioned sense of storytelling The Outsiders certainly does not stack up to Coppola's enduring classics, but it's fun in a goofy sort of way and you could do worse if you just want 90 minutes (in the unextended edition) of campy entertainment.2.5/4"
2,A ok movie but it is boring.,This movie is boring well to me anyway. It dosent have anything fresh in it it is just old and not ariginle plus the acting from all these grate actors we now well they did not do a vary good acting job. And I understand it was one of there first movies but still I have seen better.
1,Question Actually,I was wondering if anyone knew if this particular version was the one with the court scene and the scene where Soda runs off. My copy doesn't have that and thats one of my favorite scenes!
2,"Well, I guess it's true what they say...","This actually was quite bad... embarassingly bad. What kind of crack was Francis smoking that year?Plus, I don't know if anyone else mentioned this, but the subtitles are terrible, too... They completely misrepresent the dialogue. What's up with that?"
4,One great movie.,I've seen this movie millions of times and all I gotta say is: Dallas Winston is the best.
1,Classic example of movie makers ****ing up original classics,"DON'T BUY THIS!! If you love the ORIGINAL version of this film steer clear of this one. FFC completely ruined this classic film by adding the worst possible background music at the worst possible times.I had not seen this movie in a long time before I bought this edition. I don't remember there being as much music in the original film as there is in this version. FFC turned it from a dramatic masterpiece to a piece of fluff that sells out to the ""High School Musical"" generation."
4,"Lets do it for Johnny man,Lets do it for JOHNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Excellent story,excellent movie. Matt Dillon as DALLAS gives a Academy Award winning performance as far as am concered,excellent acting by Cruise,Swayze,Macchio,Howell,Estevez,and Lowe. Great Flick,but not a chick flick!!!!"
3,Fun to see the stars before they became famous.,Obvioulsy a little dated but seeing all these stars at the beginnined of their careers made it well worth watching
5,outsiders,"this is a great movie for young teens . no graphic violence like the movies now a days. but it can still keep them interested in the characters. i recommend it for the whole family , it shows how everyone , regardless of where they come from , can get along if they just try."
4,Great Movie,This is a good movie. I read it in school in 7th grade. We watched the movie and I loved it. I am sad that Cherry and Ponyboy never dated. Great movie though.
4,Fairly good movie but a poor adaptation of the book,"I was assigned the book recently in school, and I loved it. My teacher showed us this film. The film was decent, but it was a poor adaptation; the climax was changed, and the entire middle section of the book was practically removed. What's interesting to me is that the author S.E. Hinton had a small role in the film, as a nurse, and if I were her, I'd be mad that the ending was completely different. I guess that they explained to her that it was a marketing move. She didn't even write the screenplay. Scripts are a tough thing on films who's books were so popular. You have to make it close to the book, but if you make it too close, this happens. This is an ok dvd that looks surprisingly great in full screen. Read the book, then see this. You will probably be disappointed, but still entertained."
5,Amasing!!!You MUST see it!!!!!!!!,"What an amasing film and book. I read the book first in english and thought it was exellent. then i saw the film and thought it was just as good. I thought they should added more to the film (it was too short for my liking). It makes me cry every time when i read and watch 'The Outsiders'. The actors did a brill job, especially C Thomas Howell. You must see it!!!!!!!"
4,i liked it,"I had never seen the original version of this movie. We just started the book in school so I ordered the new DVD. After the feedback I have read, I kept expecting to hear this awful, obnoxious soundtrack music ... but it never happened. I actually really like the music in this film!In fact, I decided to rent the old version just to compare, and I think THAT music sucked. It's too fluffy and cheesy and over-the-top sentimental. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of classical music ... but either way I think that 50's rock n' roll and surf music makes way more sense for the Greasers.That aside, this is a pretty cool film. It can be very sad and intense, and also very funny and lighthearted. In places I think the acting can be pretty overdone and overdramatic (much like the original soundtrack) but I guess they couldn't replace THAT!"
5,the outsiders,"I love this story. I have the book and the movie, it is one of the few movies that doesn't stray from the book. This movie is one of my favorites."
3,Audio Sucks!!,"I haven't seen this movie in many yrs but recently got the new version (1 Disc). So far I like it but the audio totally sucks!!! We are turning the volume up & down every few sec's b/c everytime music comes in, it is WAY too loud & then most of the talking you can't even hear."
3,The Book or the Movie?,"There are several reasons for my rating of 3 stars for this movie. One of them is that I had good actors and they played their role very good. Some of the actors are well known and make it a good movie. The settings of the book in the movie were described well and how the book described them. In the movie there not some parts from the story that came in the book, which makes a little bit incomplete the movie. In the role of the plot on the movie, there was almost everything that came in the book except the jump of Ponyboy by the Socs. I didn't imagine the settings of the movie as the book described them, because I think that they weren't so original to take you in the world of the story as in the book. The movie discussed the main events good, but with absence of some details. It had almost all the main events that are in the book, but is a complete movie. Finally after my brief review I think that the book of The Outsiders is much better than the movie."
3,The Outsiders are loaded with future stars,It was fun to watch with my grand daughter. Nearly everyone in this movie became a big star.
4,Misleading title description,"I bought this item believing this was novel on CD due to description stating, The Complete Novel. I had purchased the movie along with this item. Now I have two of the same movie."
4,Had to have it,I had seen and read this book 24 years ago and I just had to own it. The story is as true to life for young people today as it was back then. Timeless!!
4,ALL STAR CAST RAISES 'THE OUTSIDERS'.,"The film may not be as good as the book, but bearing in mind the films shortened runtime, it is still a compelling watch. The film may have dated slightly but it was styled that way. The all star cast is what really makes 'The Outsiders'. Seeing all those famous names and then 'star spotting' as they appear. Actors like TOM CRUISE (Mission Impossible, MI2, Top Gun), MATT DILLON (Something About Mary, To Die For, RumbleFish) and DIANE LANE (Perfect Storm, Murder at 1600, Streets of Fire) have all become big stars, and PATRICK SWAYZE, ROB LOWE, EMILIO ESTEVEZ, C THOMAS HOWELL, and RALPH MACCHIO didn't do badly either for a while. How much would a movie with this cast cost to make today do you think? Million$$$$$$!! Good flick - check it out for several reasons."
1,TERRIBLE,"This special edition is the worst movie I've ever seen. You see, I love the Outsiders. it is a great story, filled with great characters. I've wanted the movie for a long time. Than i finally got the special edition one. Really, the worst part about this edition is the music. it is horrible! it just ruins the movie. For instance, in the scenes were Dally dies and Jhonny kills the scos, their playing rock and roll music! it totally ruined the moment. And the music is constanly playing, so it's hard to concintrate on the movie. And, the added scenes in the movie are totally unnessary. if you are an Outsider fan, whatever you do, DON'T GET THIS SPECIAL EDITION MOVIE! Just stick with the origanal. It's much better, and presents the story in a much more memerable way."
1,Musical Travesty,"I don't know if you could find a bigger fan of the original version of this film than me. I watched it almost every day growing up and can still repeat every line as I watch it today. I was so excited to see it on DVD but the movie was 100% spoiled by the new soundtrack. I am STUNNED at how many reviewers have said it is an improvement and how Coppola could have done this and thought it was good. The new music completely changes the tone of the entire film and removes all of the tension, drama and tragedy that are at the center of this movie. To replace the emotional soundtrack at key moments like the murder of the Soc, the rumble and Dally's run from the law with chipper surfer tunes is so confusing and jarring that I am no longer able to enjoy the film. This is a travesty and should never have been messed with - where can I find a VHS copy?"
5,~The Outsiders~~,I love this movie. any one with a brain would just love it the actors are great the whole movie is just awesome. ***** i would totally recomend this movie to anyone. It never gets boring to me.
4,Great,Great movie if u are reading this in shcool great also but make sure you know the differences between the book and the movie and their are differences
2,Horrible,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen. It follows the book well, but is horrible (unlike the book). The guy from Mighty Ducks, Amelio Arestaves or whatever and whoever plays Dally are the only good actors. Dreadful stuff...It doesn't make sense. Good Book, good other books, good other movies, but this one is horrible. Don't waste your time. Read the book."
1,Bleck!,"Oh my gosh! this was really bad. I mean, If you didn't read the book, you'd never have understood the movie. It had really bad acting, too. The only thing that I liked about this movie was the hot guys."
2,The Outsiders,"I purchased the Outsiders from ckellyphila@verizon.net and never received my movie. I did send an e-mail to this person asking about the movie and never got a response back. If this person does not have the movie or does not want to send it out, they should not advertise the movie for sale. I will double check to make sure my account was not charged for the item I never received. Melissa Hinman"
5,Great Movie!,"This is a great movie, it is well worth the price, and I do not regret purchasing this movie. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone!"
3,The Outsiders,It was fun going back and seeing The Outsiders movie again all these years later. I forgot it was a low budget movie and the acting isn't that good. I bought the movie because my grand daughter was reading the book in school.
5,Great Movie,"I am so happy my hubby bought this movie for me!!!! When I was in high school a few years back there was a reading period. The reading bell will ring and all of the students in the school had to stop what they were learning or doing to read. My teach had The Outsiders book in her classroom when the bell rung. I was very excited to read it every day. After I finished reading The Outsiders my teach showed the video for the whole class.I enjoyed the movie from the beginning till the end. I bought the VHS a few months after watching the movie at school. Now dvd's are in and VHS's are out. So my hubby bought this movie for me. I enjoy watching it, but I like the VHS better then the Dvd. I hate when they put a movie on dvd and change things."
2,"Nice Acting and Actors, but Weak Script sinks the movie","Great Cast, great cinematography, Diane Lane is awesome looking, but who the hell wrote the screenplay? I wasn't sure if this was camp or what. And is F. Ford C perhaps the most over rated director of our time. Perhaps. I wasted my money buying this dvd. Oh well, the housing market has bottomed, the stock market is going up, and everything in America Sept 2009 is just great."
4,The Movie of an Era,This is a monumental piece for pre-teens growing up in the 80's. The book added drama during my puberty blues and the Coppola did the movie justice.
3,The book was much better.,"The Outsiders novel is a classic. One of the few books that I actaully enjoyed reading in my junior high - High school years. I just recently saw the Outsiders movie, and I was extremely dissapointed. If my memory serves correctly, there was a lot more dialogue with the Curtis brothers. They also neglected Ponyboy getting ganged up by the socs. I thought that Sodapop had blonde hair? The kid who played Ponyboy Curtis.. was horrible! But everyone else is great here though. On its own, pretty good movie, but compared to the book? Mediocre"
2,Stuff missing,"It is supposed to come with 8 exclusive postcards of the people, and I only received one of them but it was supposed to be a new unused movie. So where are the other 7?"
5,GREAT MOVIE,"I've always admired this film, and my sister has as well. It was present for her because she was feeling ill, it cheered her right up. So many good actors in this film before they really got their start in cinema so great."
3,poor copy,"There are expectations when buying a dvd. The picture quality of The Outsiders was good. But the timing of the sound and motion of the lips did not match up together. It made watching the movie quite distracting, especially since I lip read while watching a movie."
3,The Outsiders,"The DVD's I received missed several scenes from the movie including Pony getting jumped, Two-Bit yelling at Johnny's mom, and the court scenes at the end. Frustrating when trying to use as a comparing tool in the classroom."
2,make a new movie,I think this movie had a lot of potential but I don't think that it lived up to its expectations. This movie would be very confusing if someone did not read the book. I think they left a lot of essentials from the book. I was even confused and I actually read the book. if they remade the movie I think that it would be a really good movie.
1,He SCREWED us for Johnny,"What the f*ck, Coppola???? Ok, I can understand and appreciate adding the cut footage, but changing the music!!!???? By doing this Coppola has trashed a classic.At the least they could offer a choice of the original film on this DVD. I can't recommend this version. Wait for it to play again on TV, I'm sure AMC is showing it next week...Thank you Baby for my X-mas gift, it's the thought that counts."
4,Outsiders DVD,"Bought it for my daughter, who loves it. No problems with ordering, payment or delivery."
5,great movie to show class,"I am an english teacher, and my class had just finished reading the novel when the movie arrived. It was great- really brought home the emotion of the book. There were differences, and that lead to more 'teachable moments.'"
5,The Outsiders - The Complete Novel (Two-Disc Special Edition),The Outsiders - The Complete Novel (Two-Disc Special Edition) is awesome for many reason one being the extra footage
4,best dual pack I have seen,If you had to read this book in High School and enjoyed it back then You will enjoy re reading the book and watching the movie
3,Amazing Cast,I was recommended this title be a coworker; when I purchased the movie I was amazed at all the famous actors and how young they were in this movie. The content didn't have much value for my taste but it was a treat to see so many young stars in one show! The value rating was super high just for that reason alone.
4,Good learning experience.,The 'Outsiders' is a good movie. The kind that you watch once or twice with teen or preteen kids....and talk about aftterward. The story is about the the struggles faced by socially and economically disadvantaged kids....exascerbated by by ugly behavior on the part of 'rich' kids. I watched it with my middle-school age son and two of his friends. They were affected by it and expressed compassion for the kids 'from the other side of the tracks'. Every kid and parent should sit at least once with this movie.
5,The Greatest book/movie I ever read/watched,I really like this book and movie. I read the book a thousand time and I never got tired of it. In this book the Socs judge the greeser by how they dress and how they look and beated them up. I thought it was wrong because the Greesers didn't do anything to them. It taught me not to judge people on how they dress or how they look before you know them.
2,Kid Reviews- 8a class #20,"The actors from the movie did play their part right, but I have to add they didn't show that much emotion as the characters in the book. I also missed Pony's voice over in the movie, what happened with all his thoughts? The only character that was really the same as the book was Johnny. The setting was great I really felt that it was just as the book. There was one tiny little problem. In the book the Greasers are east, and Socs are west. In the movie Greasers are south and Socs are north! That made it confusing if you had already read the book. Even though of that mistake it was just as I imagined. It didn't discuss the themes in the book correctly. It missed so much stuff. Like when Ponyboy was sick and everything. The message of the book didn't get through the movie. I think the book was so much better! The book is awesome I seriously recommend it."
3,I Love Cherry.,"The Outsiders is a good film but I've grown sick of it over the years. Matt Dillion, Ralph Macchio, and C. Thomas Howell give the best performances in this all-star cast. I like the story but the look of this film is so dated and washed-out. This is a film every young adult should watch, and hey look for a red-headed Diane Lane who plays the beautiful but stubborn Cherry. Give this film a try sometime."
5,"Before ""The Outsiders"" there was nothing.","This movie is absolutely great. There's not other movie of the same genre that can actually compare to this one. The story of these young men trying to fit in into society and the conflicts they encounter in life are just a short example of what this movie is all about. This is one of those movie that you watch and will stay with you FOREVER. It's not a big surprise that if it was based from a great book the result would be an even greater movie that everyone would enjoy watching. Before ""The Outsiders"" for me, there was nothing as big as this. I recommend this movie a 100% and I guarantee it has everything and even more of the things you look for in a movie. It has action, suspense, drama, sad scenes, and why not, romance everything done in a clean way. The format would show its age eventually but a master piece will never be too old or too bad for the new generation to enjoy it."
1,dvd,This DVD was scratched and does not work. I looks like it was already used. I will not order from you again.
2,The movie could be so much better than this.,"Ok,This is probably really really biased becuase I love the book so much and the book is a lot better,and the movies are never as good as the books but it [is terrible] compared to the book.it has really really horrible casting for one.I'm sure it couldn't have been that hard to find charcters slightly similar to the ones in the book.It leaves out some really good dialogue and majpr parts of the book as well."
1,boring,"Movie was boring and made no sense. Before it really gets started, it's over. The only good part is seeing all of these now famous actors in their younger days."
2,The Outsiders The Movie.,"The movie version of the outsdiers wasn't as good as the book.The book added alot more details, The book seemed to be alot more exciting. When I saw the movie I was really disappointed. I pictured everything in my mind how the people died and what everything looked like.The movie was disappointing because There were things in the book that didn't even happen in the movie, for example the beggining the book, ponyboy is on his way out of the movies and he gets jumped by the socs, and in the movie he is writing his paper, by the way you never even find out why he is writing his paper, in the end of the book you find out that Pony and Soda don't go to the boys home, but in the movie you hear about them might having to go to the boys home but you never find out if they do. So I definitely liked the book better. It was way more exciting and you find out more. I think if they remade the movie today, it could be alot better."
4,Great movie but obviously not as good as the book.,"Great movie but it's not as great as the book. I'm a 41 year old mom and the book is still one of my favorites. No movie ever comes close to any book, but this movie is pretty darn close. A lot of old actors in it. A lot of teen heart throbs from the 80's. Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Esteves, C Tommy Howell, Rob Lowe, Ralph Machio....on & on. Again, great movie though."
5,The Outsiders Rocks!,"I absolutely love this movie! Words cant explain it! I mean we were reading the book in class, and then we saw the movie. I couldnt get enough of it. lol* Well Thomas Howell has been my favorite actor since I saw E.T. He is such an amazing actor. We all know he was young when he filmed this movie, but still today he is awesome. The movie deals w/a lot of things and issues that teens deal with. Thats 1 reason why I love it! Then cause Thomas Howell, i mean hes hott and a great actor. Along with my 2nd favorite actor Rob Lowe whos work I admire also lol* Then there is Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Maccio, Emilio Estevez, Darren Dalton, Diane Lane, Michelle Meyrink, and Leif Garrett. The movie is very emotional too! But w/ a cast of hott guys it makes the film even better! lol* K well go out and rent the movie..but I do suggest that you read the book first...they have a lot of differences. K well bye"
2,"Boo! Like usual, the book is better","It almsot seems impossible that Francis Ford Coppola directed this movie. I thought he directed GOOD movies! Instead, he directs this unconvincing trash that doesn't live CLOSE to the 1967 book. I am shocked and stunned, really I am.The movie is a lot like the book in events and word phrases. But the book has a special something that created more attention. I really had great expectations for this movie. Boy, was I disappointed! Trust my advice, you would not like this movie. If you have to read it for school and did not finish reading it and the test is tomorrow, then I would suggest the movie. I really belive that the idiots who gave the movie four and five stars really did not pay attention to the book. Because if they paid attention to the book more thoroughly, they would have prefered the book over the movie, believe me."
5,Great recipes for casual entertaining,Contains recipes for casual entertaining which can be made ahead of time and served at room temperature. Good ideas for combining ingredients and for menus.
4,pictures are needed!,"Good book, some interesting and rather easy recipes, but no pictures. This makes it less usable and not very inspiring."
5,Cucina Fresca,This book is a longtime favorite of mine and it was purchased as a gift for a young chef. The recipes are simple and the results are delicious. Cucina Fresca should be in any cooks library.
5,AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY!,"Sally's cross-referencing (topical, denominational, etc.) makes finding just the right publisher as easy as it can be. Of course, no market guide can take the place of actually contacting publishers for guidelines and themes lists, but 'The Christian Writers Market Guide' is a great spring board for the writer who seeks to be published. Sally also offers excellent advice on approaching markets and her user-friendly glossary makes technical terms a breeze. Secular writers market guides in comparison, offer only a fraction of leads into the Christian publishing field. If you want to be published in any form of Christian literature, from novels to greeting cards, 'The Christian Writers Market Guide' is an absolute necessity."
1,"Unreliable, unfortunately","Well, I wish I could back this book 100%, but I can't.I've found the information in it very unreliable. For example, one publisher I contacted turned out to be a vanity press, although Sally Stuart didn't identify them as such. In addition, I found many agents that were listed had either moved or were no longer in business. Perhaps the book needs to be updated more regularly?I have yet to discover a solid publisher or agent through this book that isn't listed in the Writer's Market."
2,Optimization focused,"I was looking for a book about the practical side of designing thermal systems (heat exchanger design, fluid flow, etc) that goes into more detail than your standard thermodynamics and fluid dynamics book. The primary focus of this book is optimization theory. The title is misleading to me. It should be titled something like ""Optimization Theory applied to Thermal Systems""."
3,Hilariously raunchy,"If you purchase this movie take it with a grain of salt and remember what it is, it was actually quite silly and funny at it's best downright stupid at times and raunchy as well a Pink Movie, good for late night entertainment or crazy drunken parties with the right people."
2,Yawn.,"Risa Koda is cute as heck, but that's about the only good thing in the movie.This movie doesn't pass the blank screen test: ""Is it more interesting than watching a blank screen for the same amount of time?""I give it two stars only because Risa Koda is so sexy."
3,Worked great for a while....,"When it worked it was great. Had great eye relief, adjustable brightness and I was able to align it to the scope quite simply. However, after only a few months of use, it will not work anymore - even with brand new batteries. It just quit one night and will not work no matter what. I was hoping for something a little more durable than just a few months of use for $30+ ..."
2,"too bright, even at lowest setting. not worth price","I bought this but ended up returning it and getting a Telrad (which is working great, though I wouldn't recommend it on anything smaller than a 6"").The dot brightness is variable, but even at the lowest setting it's still too bright. I couldn't even see Polaris once I had the red dot shining at me. Also, don't let the look fool you--this unit is completely plastic and definitely feels a bit flimsy. At $32 plus tax and shipping, I'd definitely recommend just throwing another $10-$20 in and getting a better unit.But on a positive note, Orion made the return very quick and easy, even prividing a printable UPS label. Well done!"
1,Cheap - Broke after a few months,This is a cheaply made finder scope that stopped working after a it was lightly dropped on a table. It never worked again after only being used for a few months. Do not recommend.
1,Breaks easily,I liked the finder but its switch broke too soon. The scope an xt10 is a solid scope for the price. This part however doesn't last.
4,Literacy: An Advanced Resource Book,"I do not mind all of the pencil and ink remarks in books. What I am glad about is that there are no highlighter markings, I find those to be more distracting and seem to miss what I might have highlighted. I find pencil or ink remarks more relevant to content. Thank you for sharing especially when the cost of education keeps going up and up. Any book deals are appreciated."
5,Good value,I found this item to be be the best price for a quality motor by far! Same part number listed by all selling TYC but it has open vents and I felt my app might allow water/salt to splash in so I sealed it. It had a vent hose in that app anyway so all is well. SATTSPARTS has outstanding processing and shipping!! I'd order from them again!
5,works great,My blower motor went out on the hottest day of the year i order the replacement it came super fast and i put it on myself works great thanxxx
1,YUCK!!!!!!,"Im a 32 yr old male. I don't know if I got a bad batch or what but the Cold-Eeze cold remedy Tropical Orange flavor lozenges start out good but after a minute or two start causing my mouth to dry up and I start getting this horrible metalic taste and tingling sensation on the back of my tongue and throat. It is a horrible flavor after that. I try to endure it but spit them out instead. I would much rather have the cold or sickness than take these ever again. Even after the lozenge is disolved, I cannot taste food for 30 min after and have to drink something fizzy to regain taste and to make the slight tingling numbness feeling to go away. I will not be using these again. Will just stick with my Airborne."
1,Cold-ezee is just an expensive cough drop,"I bought Cold-ezee because it was $1 cheaper than Airborne. I wish I would have spent the extra $1 because Cold-ezee was the biggest waste of $5 I have spent in a long time. I started taking them within the first 24 hours after my cold symptoms appeared. The only thing that it did was help my cough. However, it always made my mouth feel very dry, which most other cough drops do not do. My cold progressively got worse each day even while taking Cold-ezee. I still have my cold after about a week. That is generally how long a cold last anyways. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It was definitely a waste of money."
5,AMAZING,"These things may not taste the best, but they work. They aren't bad tasting either, just the zinc can make your mouth feel dry. I tried these at the first sign of a sore throat and stuffed up nose. It soothed my sore throat almost instantly. The sore throat lasted less than a day and the stuffy nose cleared up within two days. My colds normally last up to two weeks. I was feeling back to normal at around three days! I will definitely buy these again!!"
4,Used one night,"Used on night as a test. Worked ok, but not a cold night. For the price worth having on a trip."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This book contains very simplistic advice that is better acquired through discriminating web surfing. The writing is very poor and there are also tons of misspellings (often comical). The author is also overly obsessed with the 'best dog' in the litter and believes only in breeding. There is no advice for anyone who has adopted an older chihuahua, and even if you have a new puppy, i higly recommend, strongly advocate another book."
1,Low quality book,"Everything about this book is done to a low standard: the pictures, the editing, the information, and the presentation."
2,Poor connection.,"I have the same problem in 2/3 of the cars I've tried it in. The springy center part does not spring out correctly leaving only intermittent contact. I got Garmin to sent me a second one free, but it has the same problem! This makes 3 total, since I had one of the older style ones with the COM port for my older unit. I had to fix that one using the spring from a ball point pen.It's not just in my car either. I've used other car adapters without any problem."
5,Simple Solution,"No big surprises - this works as you'd expect it to. It has a replaceble fuse and is an ""official"" Garmin product.You need one of these if you are navigating at night so you can keep your backlight on the whole time."
4,GPS power cord,For long trips you have to have one of these. Makes good sense to have a GPS with a lot of power all day long. Save on batteries. It wil lpayfor itself in no time at all.
5,Works as advertised for GarminMap 76s,Many people having trouble. Recommend reading all reviews before purchasing to see which units are not working with this product
1,Don't buy it for C340,"I bought it for my c340 but it does not work with it. Maybe it was my fault for not reading the description in depth. I really thought it did say it is good for street pilots, though. There might not be anything wrong with the item but it needs a better technical description."
3,Works great but don't use it,I purchased this adapter for my Garmin 60Cx but don't use it because I realized that the car charger for my Motorola Razr phone works instead. It's easier to plug in and doesn't interfere with the car mount as much.
4,Works Well!,"This product does everything it says it does in the advertisement. If you plan on leaving the GPS in the same vehicle, I would advise attaching the power lead to the side of the console or at least tucking the excess under the seat."
1,Unnecessary purchase,"This purchase was unnecessary; the Amazon descrption of the GPS device implied that the adapter was not included, but one is included."
1,Does not work with the Garmin eTrex Venture CX,When I purchased this I thought it would work with the Garmin eTrex Venture cx that I purchased at the same time. Well I was wrong. I had to purchase a iGo unit from Radio Shack to power this while in the car. The iGo unit worked very well while we drove from MN to CA.
1,WRONG PRODUCT,This was shown as an accessory for the NUVI I purchased but it isn't the correct charger to go with it...and it came with a charger.
5,Garmin 010-10085-00 Cigarette Lighter Adapter,This is a great purchase. It allows me to have continous power to my GPS while Driving on the road or on my boat. Always be prepared for unexpected power failures and keep batteries for back up.
1,Wrong cord for the C330,"What's up with this? This is the WRONG cord for the C330 - I returned it and got a refund, Amazon's service is great as usual. So come on, fix this."
1,MISLED by James Steiner !!! please be responsible for review,"be warned!!! don't believe James Steiner's review about this adapter working on eTrex!!!nothing wrong with the item itself but, this product is NOT for eTrex series at all!!!! i kinda knew that by looking at its description, but the following review just misled me to the wrong way so now i have a headache to deal with when i got the Vista and the adapter that doesn't work on my GPS.Reviewer: James Steiner (see more about me) from Oceanside, California USAI use this with my Garmin E-Trex Vista. Never worry about running out of batteries as I drive. Use away from home to track your travels. Cord is long and durable. Light lets you know if it is getting power."
1,Bogus Listing,This item popped up as I was purchasing a C330. I thought I needed it. Wrong! Not only does the C330 come with its own 12v cable this on would not work anyway. Beware! You will be returning it just like I did.
1,NOT Compatible with c330.,The website encourages you to purchase this part with your c330. This presents two big problems:1. You don't need it!2. It is not compatible with the c330!Somebody needs to fix this on the website.
3,You get this with the StreetPilot,"I'm sure this is a great product, but I bought it because I got the mistaken impression that you needed it to use the Garmin StreetPilot. I think it was a suggestion by Amazon. But, the unit come with the lighter adapter so I sent it back for credit, which Amazon handled perfectly. So, don't get it unless you want an extra."
1,Beware- Received NON Vista Software,"I ordered DeLorme Street Atlas 2007 Plus USA/Canada on April 23, 2007.The software I received from Amazon was for Win2003/Win XP and is not WinVista ready. I contacted DeLorme and they have an upgrade but you must pay for UPS shipping!This is a pain!DeLorme says they brought out the 2007 version in September 2006 before Vista was released and are not responsible if Amazon has old stock. Amazon is cleaning out their old stock, BEWARE!!!!!"
2,Weight is in the handle,"It's pretty, it's sharp, blah..blah..blah. Guess what? It's not balanced well. The knife is weighted in the handle which will cause fatigue, and can be potentially hazardous. There is a reason it's so steeply discounted on Amazon."
4,My girlfriend is finally on time....,"I know the title sounds a little harsh but the Franklin Covey system has worked wonders for someone who used to rely on the post-it-note system. Needless to say the little square sticky notes were not working too well. However she has found the Franklin Covey planner attractive, easy to use and loves the ability to customize the pages and layout to her preferences.My only gripe is that the leater does not feel soft at all. If I were to buy another one I would highly recommend the glove leather."
3,A nice attempt at Iberia but too many demons.,"The book covers a little of the history of the iberian peninsula, rewritten to fit in with the 'mythic' flavour of Ars Magica. There is also a section giving examples covenants, one of which are some urban magi residing in medieval Barcelona.Themes treated in the book include conflict between the pro-christian and pro-islamic mages, with collusions within islamic lands between the hermetic magi and sufi mystics.A problem with this guide, i felt, was too much of a heavy influence on demons. It also could of benefitted from at least a token attempt at rules for islamic magicians.Iberia is so fantastic a setting for an Ars Magica campaign, if you're running one it's still worth it, though i would recommend doing your own research. The Kabbalah book in the series would also be useful. Not as good as it could be."
5,Excellent timer switch - especially for fans,"I have used a number of these switches, some are more than 5 year old already. The ""clicking noise"" mentioned by the other reviewer is no louder than the clicking that you hear when depressing a paddle switch (a regular switch). The count down feature is great, and my 4-year old son already know that certain situations require 15 minutes! This is a much classier solution that the twist-type timers.This timer works with fans: NOT ALL TIMERS DO. They must be designed to kick on a motor (inductive). Leviton also makes one that is 10-20-30-60 minutes, which I use in the bathroom with the shower."
3,Neutral required,"Many Leviton Decora timers require a neutral to work, so before you open the package check in your switch box. If your existing circuit runs from the electrical panel to the fan or light before the switch box, you will not have the neutral in the switch box to operate the new timer. Like me you will bw stuck with a good timer that won't work for your location. Read the fine print on the package."
1,Sometimes Prettu but Empty,"I don't know...these poems are often about being empty, or being too cynical for anything, and maybe not about mcuh at all"
3,Mediocre,"The quality of this highlighter is 'eh' at best. I am a college student and bought the 5-pk of these (yellow, blue, orange, pink, green). The yellow one only last a few weeks before I finally gave up and threw it away. It just would not work anymore.This semester, I bought some liquid highlighters. They don't dry as fast, but they work much better. I have also used the Sanford Accent highlighters and am very happy with them. Avery Hi-Liters also work pretty well."
4,Good,"The Highlighters work Great, just a Bit Stong so if u swash it over the Surface of the paper twice u will smudge the other side, Also the Picture of the Product does not match The Actual Highlighters Received, Otherwise it Wokin"
5,A Truly Excellent Account Of Recent History,"I was privileged to hear Dr. Dolibois give a talk at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio several years ago and was impressed not only by his eloquence and capability as a speaker, but by the amazingly full life he's led in service to the United States, his adopted homeland. I wish this book would be re-issued by a publisher who was better able to publicize it and distribute it so that the tale of John Dolibois' life was better known. His stories of working as an interrogator and interpreter for the Allies at the Nuremberg trials (where he spent many hours in close contact with such Nazi leaders as Herman Goering) are not just remarkable tales, but part of the historical treasury of the American nation. A great book I highly recommend to anyone, and should be a ""must read"" for those interested in the Second World War, the Cold War, and our country's relations with the states of Europe."
1,Not a 30-pack,"I figured it was too good to be true. It is a 1-pack ""30-pack""...I ordered to see if I would get lucky but no such luck. So don't follow my dumb example and assume you're getting the deal of a lifetime."
5,After the Death of Anna Gonzales by Terri Fields,"After The Death of Anna Gonzales is by Terri FieldsI recommend for grades 6 & up.The book is an amazing book. It is very interesting and the excitement never ends. Once you start you can't put the book down.It is about a girl named Anna. She committed suicide. Everyone is trying to figure out what to do. Like one boy, wants to take Anna's seat in class. A cheerleader doesn't want Anna's death to interrupt with homecoming. Everyone is finding a way, one way or another, that might affect Anna's death.The point the author is trying to make is that, never take something that happens and make it work towards you or just because something bad happens doesn't mean something else bad is going to happenThe book is definitely worth reading. If you don't take your time you won't be able to understand the book. I'd give it 5 stars because of the amazing content."
5,The Creative Life,"In this amazing book, Dr. Butterworth unlocks the keys to creativity in the human soul. He gives great examples, illustrations, and exercises to help the individual get in touch with his/her creative self. A very practical book that empowers an individual to let their imagination soar"
4,Anger Management for Youth: Stemming Aggression And Violence,"This is a teacher / student program and work book that should be used by junior and senior high schools (alternative schools) as a means to develop peer groups for at risk youths. Excellent ideas which are laid out in modular format for ease of use by the instructor.Do not buy this book if you are a parent looking for personal help for your child. This book is intended for institutional settings. I bought the book to help me learn about my violent 12 year old boy, but will give the book to my friend who runs an alternative high school program."
5,Very powerful,"This is a very powerful book. I found it hard to read not due to the writing style; but, due to the events it depicted. I could only read short passages at a vtime due to the upsetting nature of the historical events. I came away with a whole different view on Andrew Jackson. I no longer have a favorable opinion of him. I came away with a different perspective on Native Americans."
2,a worthy topic but not an easy read,"a topic of great interest to me but one-third of the way through i had to put the book down. i found the writing style to be disjointed and difficult to follow. thoughts and ideas and information did not flow well and dispite the compelling subject, i do not recommend this book."
2,Does not represent the true facts as they really were!,"This movie was influenced by the writings of the white people. The costuming was not correct, as they Indians progressed down The Trail of Tears, their clothes would have been torn, dirty and tattered. They did not have all the nice blankets that the movie protrayed! Many Indians froze to death because of lack of clothing and warm coverings. If it was really been written by the Indians that were on the Trail of Tears, it would have been protrayed all together different. It would have shown the REAL truth about what happened, like in the book called the ""End of the Trail of Tears"". This book shows the REAL truth, written by a real Native American, and all the hardships that they had to endure during their forced removal to Oklahoma."
2,MSG and 10% Water-Salt- SodiumPhospate... yum?,"I'm experimenting with various Campbell soups because I'm on diet. And from a diet point-of-view the Beefy Mushroom soup is not bad. A whole can made up with water is only 125 calories.However, that said, I shan't be buying it again. First off, too thin and watery. There is less than 1/4 cup of anything solid, ie, mushrooms or beef cubes.Another minus is the MSG (monosodium glutamate).Another minus is the 890 mg of sodium. Yikes! But what can you expect when 10% of this product is described as ""Water, Salt, and Sodium Phospate.Other unsavory ingredients include Hydrolyzed Yeast Protein and Extract, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, and Hydrolyzed Wheat Gluten.Not another can for my family or myself. It's not healthy and it left me with a funny aftertaste in my mouth.Going to brush now...Pam T~"
1,Wrong Description - Not for Street Pilot,This is one half of the Garmin Automotive Mount for Garmin GPS Map 72 and GPS 76 only. Search item # 101025700 in Amazon to see both parts.
1,Wrong Item,"While the product description says that it is compatible with the Garmin C340, it is the wrong shape and does not work.Amazon was great in accepting the return and refunding my money."
1,What a disappointment! The Extra Mount For Street Pilot -that isn't!,"I purchased this at point of sale when I purchased the street pilot because the product description said it was compatible. IT IS NOT!! BUt let's face it, an $11 item retun minus shipping fees, is it worth the hassle?"
4,Garmin GPS Dashboard Mount,I must say the product was exceptionally built by garmin. My last garmin mount lasted over 6 years with continued use of my GPS being taken out. I was able to find the mount on Amazon from an exceptional seller who gave a very reasonable price and fast shipping. Thanks Amazon!!!
3,Adhesive mounts not very good,"The package includes two mounts, one removable and one permanent (meaning not that it can't be removed, but that once you remove it, it can't be reused). The removable one I found to be worthless - it did not stick at all. The permanent one works better, but it still is not nearly as firm as you would expect."
1,impossible to use without additional accessories,"Comes with lousy instructions and is not complete, as far as I can tell."
2,Not size advertised,"Franklin is a five star product. I rated two because the advertisement says ""Sierra Leather-Like Zipped Organizer Starter Set, Classic: 5-1/2x8-1/2, Black"" but it is actually 8 X 10 and 2.25 thick. I was looking for a smaller size Much too big for my uses but the seller refused a return/refund. Suggest contact Franklin Covey direct, get a phone assistant and get exactly what you want the first time so you don't get stuck with one you won't use."
3,Disposable Gloves Wall Mount Glove Dispensers Wire,Works well but expensive for what it is. A simple wire holder. Nothing more nothing less. It was the cheapest one I cojuld find. Shipping cost was excessive.
2,Not what we needed,"This holder does not accomodate standard medical gloves boxes, they did not fit securely. The quality was okay, maybe more for work gloves or a garage."
1,wrong product,"the product shown and the product ship weren't the same. i received two single tubes, not the one shown which is what i need."
2,Great Mount but the stick-on mounting is marginal,"The part of this bracket that holds the GPS is terrific. But the stick-on base is a joke. If you have treated your mounting surface previously with any kind of cleaner, polish, or wax, you will find it nearly impossible to mount this bracket. They supply cleaner and instructions, and on brand new surfaces I suspect it works better. But beware, this thing will let your nice GPS go flying just when you can't afford it to...Buy the garmin Marine Mount for your GPSMap 76, drill a couple holes and hard-mount the unit - you won't regret it. Alternatively, look at the various RAM mounts made for the GPSMap 76 series - they too have hard mount solutions that will secure your unit as it deserves to be."
5,Works great with Garmin 76,I bought the auto mount to use with my Garmin 76. I have it attached to my vertical dashboard with the removable adhesive and it works just fine. It holds the Garmin securely and the notch in the back allows the auto charger to be plugged in to the Garmin so the Garmin can run with the backlight on and not run down the batteries.
3,Adequate for me,"Not as adjustable as the etrex mount, but works for me. It has the same base as the etrex mount, in fact - I didn't have to peel off the etrex base to snap in the holder for my 76Csx; just popped the etrex one out, gpsmap one going in.Kind of pricey for what you get, but if you want/need one, you don't have many manufacturers (2) that makes a mount. A RAM mount would be an alternative, but I couldn't tell if they had temporary adhesive disks like garmin. So I went with Garmin."
3,GPS Mount,"The stickers don't stick on regula dash, I like the ability to screw mount these though. I did not mount like I was suppsed to but over all still happy with the mount."
3,Garmin Swiveling Automotive Mount for the GPS 76CSX,"This unit is a very basic one that mounts on the dash or else where by adhesive patch. One patch is supposed to be a temperary one and that works just like junk. If it gets very hot in the car the whole thing comes down. I had to the resort to the permanent mount which I really didn't want to do. But that work just fine and was just used on a 2500 mile trip tp Yellowstone NP. I would not purchase another one like this, even though it did the job. Under other conditions it probably would have been just right for the job."
4,Rugged and Dependable,"I've been using this mount in my car for almost a year now and it has held up well. I like the fact the holder comes off the base so it can be used in other vehicles with other bases. I use it on a beanbag style base in my wifes van and that setup works good too.The reason the mount only gets four stars from me is the fact that it is difficult, and sometimes takes two hands, to put the GPS in and to remove it when using the cigarette plug power cord."
3,"item is flimsy, likely won't hold up over time","item fits all sizes of iPods, but it uses an adjustable arm to do so, which does not look like it will survive extended usage. The item doesn't even work, anyway. No charge, no radio transmission. Fresh out of the box too. We are looking into our car charger to more fully explore the nature of the problem, but had i known about the ""adjustability"" factor earlier, i wouldn't have bought this item."
5,Green bulb is good,Green bulb burned green. It was fantastic and more words are required to write this for some reason. Oh boy.
5,Good quality,It is a good quality bulb. Color is uniform. A little pricy but OK. I recommend this bulb. It arrived on time and packaged well to prevent breakage.
4,hard to find,For some reason this is a hard item to find in my local stores. It's the only shampoo I care to use so it is convenient to order it.
5,Electrifying,Electricity on demand in a stylishly thin silver package. What more could you want?If you find that you have to reset your PC's clock after it's unplugged AND your computer takes a CR2032-size battery this one should solve your problem for the next few years.
5,Good,What's to review? It's a light bulb. It's great. I screws in like it should and turns on as expected.
4,Dead In Pleasant Company,"This is a great ""who-done-it""! Sal and Sam are a great combo. Story filled with twists and turns til the very end. The characters grab your interest and won't let go. Bet you can't figure it out.... great story! Also check out ""If It's Monday, It Must Be Murder"" Ms. Fairchilds First in this series."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed upon reading this book, from the cover one would think it is about evangelism. But after reading the book it did not seem so. The book was more focused on the author's relationship to Christ, and not on manfishing. After reading many Way of the Master books on evangelism, I wanted to read something from a reform view on evangelism this book did not help much at all. I thought the book should be more specific on evangelim but it was very vague in that sense."
5,Spans the generations,I grew up cooking from the battered (pun intended) copy that my mother inherited from her mother. I was delighted to find a first edition in a used book store. I've been cooking from it for twenty years. I recently bought my daughter her own copy. Each of my children will get one. The recipes are excellent. Many recipes my bubbie would have made. I love that it remains relevant and contains the history of Jewish cooking in America. The two cookbooks I wouldn't want to live without: Mastering the Art of French Cooking and The American Jewish Cookbook.
4,"Excellent Product, Just the Right Height for Interiors","However, I couldn't return the ""jumping mouse"" that was found inside the box... much to my wife's chagrin. Oh well."
5,"Louisville Ladder FS1407HD 375 Lb.duty, 7 feet",Item arrived in great shape. This 7 foot ladder works better than a 6 foot to reach ceiling areas especially for older people with less dexterity. It feels very stable because of the heavy duty feet. Also like the built-in tool slots on top - very handy! Very happy with this purchase.
3,Great design but canvas is a little weak,I really like the design simple and not to large or small. I would compare it with the standard school backpack as far as size. The cotton canvas isn't the same as the tough military molle type so I don't expect it to last forever. Another important point to make is the lack of back padding. Not a huge deal but you can feel any irregular objects on your back.
3,Nicely made,"This was the only tail I could find that didn't have sequence all over the tip. It's fairly well made for $15. Not crazy about the position of the belt loop attachment point, it should be at the top/end. Also, nit-picking, but it could be a couple of inches longer as well. It did ship quickly and arrived in good condition. If you need a simple tail for Halloween, this is it."
3,Great for commuters in a rush like myself,"I use this charger in my car to keep my Norelco 6100xl running when shaving during my morning commute.Pro's- small, and light weight, easy to stash in the arm-rest when not in use- inexpensive and convenient- makes it incredibly easy to get a quick shave in the morning if pressed for timeCon's-Inexpensive and PLASTIC, meaning the fuse housing has a tendency to loosen or wear out with time (I've had to replace mine once already in the two years I've owned one, as the fuze cap threads wore out over time and wouldn't hold the fuze in place)"
5,Starting my Senator Collection,"Now, this is the first action figure in my senate collection. It's really quite interesting. I like the design of the clothing. It reminds me of the Original Trilogy. I've been a fan as long as I can remember, but this must be one of the greatest in my collection. He may not be able to hold his gun right, but it's worth it. If you're ready to start off your senator collection, Bail Organa is the one start with. Then go for Mon Mothma, then Meena Tills, then..."
5,Great Figure!,"This toy is a great figure. It looks exactly like the character in the latest Star Wars title,Revenge Of The Sith. Bail Organa can be a great addition to anybodys collection. This Senator toy from Hasbro has to be one only one of the best. The hand-gun that comes with him is greatly detailed and well structured. His cloak is not removable thats the only disadvantage he has, he can't hold his hand-gun quite right that way. The figure is so fantastic. Even though he isn't a Jedi or Bounty Hunter coming with fantastic weapons he is still a good character."
3,Bail Organa,this toys quite cool u can use it to act out the scenes from rots but all he does in the film is stand and talk which isnt that fun he comes wiv a gun and a cloak which u can remove by popping his head of 4 all of u hu think u cant
1,Quit working within 10 months,"I purchased a refurbished unit. After approximately 10 months, the maker no longer freezes the ingredients. The most likely cause is a leak in the refrigerant line. My suspicion is that KitchenAid, upon return for refurbishment, didn't fix the leak but rather simply recharged the R134A. They offer only a six month warranty on refurbished units and the recharge would in all likelihood last beyond that (as it did). Again, this is my suspicion. I've heard others having many problems with KitchenAid's Pro Line toasters. I cannot recommend KitchenAid Pro Line series of products. They've discontinued various products in this series, possibly due to quality control issues."
2,"well-written, sanitized account","Well written but often ""half-way"" or sanitized history.For example, describes some of the wackier CIA plots to kill Castro in the Bay of Pigs era, such as explosives in cigar, but fails to mention the more ominous, documented proposals (fortunately vetoed by JFK) that the CIA stage terrorist acts on American soil and make it look like the work of Castro.Unavoidable facts such as the CIA's role in destabilizing govts around the world seem to receive very brief and reluctant mention. No mention of the well-documented LSD mind control experiments and some of the darker activities of the CIA.Although well-written, I give it only 2 stars because the book title promises ""The Inside Story"" and delivers less than halfway.This book may be suitable as a ""feel good"" history for people who aren't comfortable with the complete or unvarnished truth."
4,For the Husband,"He heard from a co-worker that this helps!!! Boy, I sure hope so!!!! When he gets sick... it's horrible!!! Please Work!!!"
2,A blind man would love to see this movie,"The description on the box is misleading. The story line is choppy, and the continuity sucks. Multiple plot lines don't climax or end and it's dry. The movies concept was good, but not properly executed. It looks like a home movie gone bad."
1,Poor quality and poor customer service,"This item is basically unusable. After I recieved it and followed the lousy instructions, I discovered that it would not fit on the fence. I took it apart and even the pieces would not fit. I called HTC and they had me ship it to them. I waited over a month for a replacement unit that came fully assembled Once again, no amount of effort allowed this thing to attach to the fence. I wound up shipping it back to Amazon after a frustrating two months. HTC should be embarressed. They must not even stock this item because everytime I called they kept telling me they were waiting for parts. In my opinion, they could not make it work either and after a month of trying just shipped it back. Amazon did the right thing and took it back."
2,Bracket broke.,I bought this bracket to hold a GPS to my sailboat's steering wheel pedestal. It worked well for a while. It seemed a bit flimsy. Even when the bolts and plastic screw were really tight the unit would wiggle. It was flimsy and eventually broke off during a sailing maneuver. I almost lost the GPS.I replaced it with a Ram Mount for the 76csx and I am much happier with it. It is built with aluminum and won't break.
5,Exactly what I needed!,The mount was exactly what I needed! It was shipped promptly and arrived quickly.
3,gps,I bought both a gps mount and a boat gps. I asked if I could return it since it was a christmas gift. Amazon informed that I could. My friend alredy had this gift I found out christmas day. I contacted Amazon and was given instructionso n returning the mount. No problems. Thegps inself however was another story. Amazon uses a sub vendoer. Amazon had me contact antonline to return the GPS. Antonline advised me that I coulsd not return this item. I contacted them again and advised that Amazon said I could. This company has ignored me since Christmas 07. Amazon has not been very helpful either. Last week Amazan finally said to just return it to antonline anyway and if antonline does not refun me in full they would refund me. This has been the biggest hassel. I have always thought Amazon to be a good service company but now I am fed up.
4,Solid Product,"Good, solid product. I thought it had a suction cup mount for multivessel use, but now have to use stainless screws to mount in on the console.Other than than, fits nicely and holds the GPS firmly."
5,Surprisingly good.,"I bought this to mount on a Jet Ski, and I was surprised at how well it works despite it's size."
5,the PERFECT anchovies,"These anchovies are something else. The fillets are fleshy, not dried up in salt like most of the anchovies I have eaten before. The consistency of the meat is preserved very well. While most anchovies are salty with the characteristic, wonderful ... stink, these anchovies are also flavorful in addition to being only stinky. I am not sure how this is done - perhaps by shortening the time the fish is cured in salt?The price is unjustifiably high though - one can get 2 lbs of Moroccan anchovies for the same price.Nevertheless, these are (from far) the best anchovies I tried."
5,Great book!,"My daughter and I love this book. The illustrations are gorgeous, and the text charming (I disagree with the reviewer's opinion that the translation is over-literal). One thing I particularly like is that although the illustrations and setting are clearly Japanese, they do not draw on stereotypes or excessively well-known icons of Japan. As a student of Japanese, I enjoy the fact that the Japanese language portion is written in kana. People who do not read kana, however, might prefer a book in which the Japanese is phonetically spelled out in roman letters."
5,My Son Loves This Book,"A beautiful book. Great drawings, and the story is written in Japanese and English.My son is 1 going to be 2 soon and we enjoy reading this book together. He talks about the book sometimes during the day, specially when we walk in the park. He says ""grandpa in the tree."" I know he is talking about this book ..."
4,Well written and well researched,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The contents of the book were rich with new items providing a fresh perspective on the forces at work in a 1945 Vietnam . The author does an excellent job of explaining the complexities of the August Revolution delving deeper than ever before in to the mind sets of the key players involved. This book provides new information about the Chinese and French perspectives leading up to the Vietnamese bid for independence.
2,Hard to charge,"the charger on this Garmin vhf 725 relies on 2 small prongs meeting 2 small contacts that are not visible. If something would say it is charging then you would know it is going to be usable when you're ready. If the contacts aren't lined up, and usually they are not, you can not use it when you are ready. When it does work though, it works great."
3,good backpack,This is a good backpack. It is probably not as goog as the more expensive ones but I am satisfied with what I got for my money.
3,Ok for the Money... You get what you pay for,"I was looking for a chair to sit at my desk that is 42 inches high. I struggled finding something tall enough that was comfortable (Had been using a wooden bar stool). I came across this and was amazed at how cheap it was, almost 50 dollars coma red to others. After assembling the chair I wasn't impressed, but it gets the job done. The arms are junk, they came off ten minutes after I put them on. I got the red one because it was the cheapest. There are no adjustments besides the height, I knew that, however the back needs to be adjusted. Over all the chair is ok for the money but for a chair I am sitting in hours a day I wish I would have gotten a nicer one for more money."
5,Great chair for the price!,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much, because this was the cheapest drafting chair I could find. But I was pleasantly surprised! I generally hate assembling furniture, but this was a really fast and simple build. The chair is very sturdy. It's not the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in, but it's not hard as a rock, either. It's the perfect height for my workbench and rolls smoothly on the carpet. The instructions state that you will need to purchase different rollers if you intend to use the chair on hardwood or tile floors or plastic mats, so keep that in mind when making a decision. Overall, I definitely recommend this!"
4,Drafting Stool,"Easy to assemble, nice to sit in for short periods. Would not suggest if you have to sit in it all day. We are using it at a work bench for short to medium timeframes and it works great."
1,Wrong Instructions,Whille attempting to assemble chair the ring at the bottom was not on the instructions. Look up correct instructions on web site. Cannot disassemble foot rest from leg assembly or remove hydraulic cylinder. The chair was a gift and should not have been hard. Assembly instruction were for a model B317. Will definitely not be using or recommending this product or company.
3,Wish it was useful as expected,The chair is so high that it can barely be used. What is the purpose for it to be that high??? In order for my son to use it we have to take the foot ring off which was the only reason we bought it. For the little one it would be comfortable to put his feet up on the ring. Other than that the chair is very good quality and my son loves to sit high up on it and spin!:)
2,Gas cylinder crapped out after a month of use.,"This chair would've been fine for what I'm using it for but the gas cylinder failed after about 5 weeks. It's cheaply made but what would you expect for the price- drafting chairs are expensive. I was sitting in it, working, and suddenly it just sank to it's lowest setting. It's been that way since."
4,"Too high when foot ring installed, too low when not installed","With the foot ring installed, the minimum seat height for this chair is 26"" and the maximum seat height is 31"". 26"" is too high for my 34"" work bench. Without the foot ring installed, the minimum seat height is 18"" high and the maximum seat height is 23"". 23"" is too low for me, but workable. Beware, it can be very difficult to remove the foot ring after you sit in the chair. The seat and arm screws were difficult to tighten securely, I had to use a socket wrench to feel secure. Other than these issues, it's a very nice chair."
5,For comfort!,I got this for a purchased drawing desk and I don't have any problems at all sitting for long periods working on projects!
4,it looks great,"Bought this for our 8 year old for her desk in her bedroom. She loves the prints and loves this chair. Way more comfortable than the wooden one she had been using before. Very soft fabric and cushion-y to sit on. Rolls and swivels nicely. It is, however, light grey NOT black. Regardless, it looks great in her room. Is a big hit at our house!"
5,Kitchen help,"My wife is disabled. This chair makes a huge difference if she wants to do things in the kitchen. It rolls easily,its comfortable, and for her the chair fits a special need in our home."
2,Arrived Defective...Amazon customer service amazing with their help,"Unfortunately we installed the pump in our septic lift tank only to find out that it was defective. Little Giant company was helpful in diagnosing the issue on the phone. Amazon customer service would have replaced the pump if they had one in stock, however it was going to be a month's wait and we couldn't shut down two bathrooms for a month. Amazon ordered a UPS pick up and refunded my money immediately. The Amazon customer service representative even called me back twice to make sure that the money credited and in our account and that the UPS pick up occurred. OUTSTANDING! They did everything possible to help a bad situation get resolved quickly so that we could move on and purchase another septic pump locally and immediately. I must say though, Amazon had the best price and as always with PRIME membership...a heavy pump was shipped for free. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING...I am a customer for life!"
3,"Wonderful video, word of warning!","I loved this and so did my daughter. Only problem we had was with ""There's a monster in my closet"" she now is afraid to sleep in her own room and talks of monsters all the time. She still asks to see Goodnight Moon, but we skip over the other. We love the kid at the end!"
5,Kids love it!!,"I have never been a huge fan of the book but I teach special ed preschool and the kids never tire of it. I bought the video for rainy, winter days and the kids love it as much as they do the book!! Iwill be buying a copy for my granddaughter."
5,Great grandma item,"This DVD not only has several wonderful stories and great voices (Billy Crystal, Susan Sarandon, Patty LaBelle, Tony Bennet and Aaron Neville ) but also great messages for children about bedtime and dreaming. The music was beautiful too. I have nine grandchildren, all very young, and this something I can watch with them and then talk to them about those nighttime anxieties - monsters under the bed, sleeping alone, all that scary stuff! Really nice."
2,Big Disappointment!,"The positive: I loved the stories and songs... they were well done.The negative: The kids in between the stories and songs kept talking about nightmares, being afraid of the dark, monsters in the closets and other places. My 3 year old does not need to be learning about this or being afraid to go to sleep!"
3,"Doesn't Work For Our House, Might Work For Yours","My one year old daughter LOVES the Classical Baby series and I purchased this DVD hoping for something along the same lines - a soothing bedtime type of show.The stories are great but each segment is prefaced with little kids chattering away. I don't mind the chatter, but I imagine that it would start to grate with repeated viewings. I wish there was a way to just view the stories.When my daughter sees the other children on TV, she is VERY interested in them. So interested that she sits straight up (almost like she's thinking, ""Ooh! Big kids!"") and we lose all of the progress we've made toward sleepytime. I'll give this DVD another shot when she's a little older.All kids are different so maybe this DVD will work at your house!"
3,Good but not Great. Doesn't keep the younger ones attention.,"The DVD is good but not great. We wanted it primarily for the Good Night Moon story which we got. However, the rest of the DVD didn't keep our daughters interest at all until she was two. It still isn't one of her favorites. I'll agree with the other reviewer, The children discussing bedtime should have been placed between stories.Its like buying a CD for one good song. The rest is just OK."
5,Delightful mix of animation and comments from real children,"This DVD is a delightful mix of animation, great music and real children discussing their thoughts about dreams, monsters and things that go bump in the night. What a great opportunity for children to hear other children discuss the subjects which every child fears at one time or another. After all, who better to know what children think than children themselves. Adults will enjoy this one also."
3,scratch the kids' interviews,"For my 14-month-old, I think we'd be better off without the interviews from the children in between the stories. I do think it would be interesting for older children, though. I would just prefer that it went straight from one story to the next."
2,It's not that good.,I bought this vedio for my toddler son. I do not think he is interested at all. There are too many talks from the kids that he would not even understand but not enough music and pictures to draw his interest.
1,HOOOOOOOOOOORIBLE!,A bunch of adult talking children who are OBVIOUSLY child actors (or over-actors) ... talking about wieeeeeeeeeerd stuff. THEY RUINED A GREAT BOOK.DO NOT BUY - DO NOT VIEW ... UTTERLY USELESS. WHY DID WE GET THIS FROM THE LIBRARY???-------
3,Creepy NYC kids featured.,"My daughter enjoys this video. I don't.It is too New York-centric, e.g. Tar Beach, references to Scarsdale. The children featured are not very endearing. There are a couple of pale unsmiling girls, some of them talk like adults with a glassy stare. They come across as city kids with city attitude. The 'hush little baby' song is too urbanized.And the Tar Beach story, I don't understand why it's so popular. The actual beach is 1 hour away by subway, much more pleasant than hanging out on a NYC rooftop and pretending it's a beach. And the empowerment message is silly.It's an OK video if you like NYC so much that you want it represented on your Good Night Moon video.-Mom on Upper Westside, NYC"
2,Tedious disappointment,"The DVD starts fine without the mandatory advertisements to go through which are the bane of these kids DVDs and the Goodnight Moon animated feature is perfect. The disk then contains a few lesser animated shorts, but the worst is several very boring and tedious discussions with real life kids about their dreams, sleeping etc. I found the blind child interview especially to be inappropriately DEPRESSING and not fitting for what I thought was a kids animated DVD. My twins hated this one and I had to put Elmo back on. A waste."
5,Excellent!,"They should make more videos like this. Great narration and fantastic music make this a wonderful ""wind-down"" video for little ones. My daughter(2yrs.)loves seeing the familiar images from Goodnight Moon and the rest of the video is just as good. We never tire of this video and where did they find the beautiful children in the interviews? If you have a child, this is a great one to have. It also makes a great gift!"
5,my two year old loves this book and video,the celebrity cast is terrific. I enjoy watching it with my son and he is obsessed with it. Best video purchase i've made in a long time.I highly recommend it.
5,Great Family Movie,"Wonderful,Wonderful,Wonderful!Both children(3.5yr.old and 17 month old)love this movie. Full of enchanting music,peaceful narration,wonderful animation and simple stories. Even the youngest child will love it. The little boy at the end will leave you laughing with the delight."
3,Best Bedtime Video,"This is a great video, with lots of animated music to entertain your kids. Best for two to five year olds. My son insists on watching it last thing before bed. We've got him weaned down to once a week! It's just the right length, and very calming. Kids can settle down easily while watching, and get to sleep after. Great images and music. Different styles of music, and singers, too. Ends with ""Dream..dream dream dream"" and my son loves to sing along with almost all the songs. Segments with kids talking about bedtime and dreams, lulabies, etc, between the songs. Very entertaining, even for adults."
3,OK,"My son loved his ""Goodnight Gorilla"" video so much, I thought this would be a great addition.... we were disappointed. Some of the stories just didn't have the same lullaby kind of feel like we got with the gorilla video. The kids' interviews in between were kind of funny, but wish they would be all at the beginning or end because I don't think we would want to watch them every time. But for purposes of ""curling up before bed,"" I would recommend the Good Night Gorilla instead. We have had this video a couple of months and haven't gone back to it."
3,Disappointing,Disappointing... not like I remember the book...Wish I had more words ... but would have to view it again!
2,Not always like the book,"I bought the Goodnight Moon dvd today for my 13 month old because he loves the book. Tar Beach and Goodnight Moon kept to the original story. I was disappointed while watching There's a Nightmare in My Closet, that the original story had been changed. I am a school librarian and have the read this story numerous times and was saying the story with the movie. Instead of the little boy having a cork gun they changed it to a toy sword. Something minor, but as a mom and librarian, I wish it would have kept true to the original classic book. I could've explained to my son that you don't play with guns."
1,not appropriate for kids,"This video is not appropriate for kids of an age who would enjoy the book ""Goodnight Moon"". The video contains interviews with kids discussing such matters as dreaming of parents who have passed away, and an endless variety of nightmares."
3,Not for children scared of monsters!,I wish I had read the reviews on this more closely before letting my 2 yr old watch this! Fortunately she was watching it with myself and her daddy so she could run to us when the scary monsters came out of the closet!! We didn't watch past that segment. Everything before that was okay!
3,Assembly required,The box says assembly required. This should be noted in advertising. Kids that want to help can make a mess. There needs to be a no assembly model. Fun and learning not extra stress please.
4,Great Game for School Carnival,"Worked great as a game for our school carnival. Each year our PTO has a carnival for our small school to raise money for field trips, basketball uniforms, etc. We wanted to add some different games this year and this was perfect."
5,Love this game,I bought it for my 5 year old daughter. She loves at well as her father and I do too. It is easy to put together and to play.
3,Tic Tac Maybe,"This toy is okay. It was just one game as part of a big birthday party full of ourdoor games and activities. This game was used by a three-year-old and left alone by the older kids. When a bag is tossed on a square there is no guarantee that the X or 0 will be changed. It could just spin around. It is a cute game for young children, but the eight and nine year-olds at our daughter's birthday party played everything else and left this to the few toddlers."
3,Smaller than expected,This is smaller than I expected but I'm sure that's my fault for not reading the description close enough but it's VERY small. I've had kids aging in range from 1-13 and it's just not very exciting for them. The plastic isn't as thick as I thought it would be. A bit disappointing.
2,Lame,"My son received this as a birthday gift. I never played it as a child, and am not familiar with the original. But there are a couple of major things wrong with this toy. My main gripe is that - once it's installed - it will not fit back in the original box. That's a recipe for losing the 5 beanbags it comes with, and makes clean-up difficult. I'm tempted to just toss this thing across the garage, into the trashcan, but I'll probably end up donating it to my child's preschool to avoid putting another giant piece of plastic crap into the landfill."
3,Not the same game we played as kids,"I was eager to play the game I spent hours as a child playing with my own boy, only to find that this inexpensive piece of plastic is not the same game. It is much smaller (both the unit and the beanbags), and extremely light weight. Unlike the game made in the 70s, the rollers have a hard time ""rolling"" because of their flimsy weight, and the overall size is so small you have to be very close or very accurate to play. I am sure it will get some use, but I doubt this version will attract the followers that the origional did."
2,Wasn't what I expected,"I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this toy. This version of Toss Across is just not the same as the one I enjoyed as a kid. The game and beanbags are smaller and it's geared more toward playing on a table rather than on the floor. The worst part for us is that once put together, it is too big to fit back in the box. It might be able to be taken apart and then put back in but that would be a huge hassle. This makes it more difficult to store neatly and guarantees some lost beanbags."
2,Poor design,"Definitely cheaped-out, not the same substantial wood(?) game that I played in the 70s. My 8-year-old had to put it together herself, complete with sticking on the x's and o's. I think the original had the x/o carved right into the square. Anyway, it works alright, hence the two stars instead of one, but you have to be accurate and throw high/hard to keep the bean bag from just sitting on top of the square and not turning it.Wouldn't bother, even for the memories..."
3,What happened?,This was one of our children's favorite games and we adults enjoyed it too. I was so disappointed to see that it has been made smaller and thus more difficult to score as in the 'old days.' If it ain't broke don't fix it. This toy should have been kept the original size.
2,A cheap version of the original game.,"I remember having lots of fun playing this game as a kid and bought it for my own family to play. I was very disappointed when I opened the box and found a cheap knock-off of the original, sturdy game. The bean bags are tiny and have little weight to them, and the games overall size is smaller too. You have to put the whole game together, including the decals for the X's and O's. That would be fine, if the plastic was at least heavy duty instead of the cheap, bendable plastic that makes up the game. There is nothing about this game that says ""quality"" and there is no way it will last with even a moderate amount of playing. Might be good for a toddler, but that is about it.I usually do not write reviews, but this product disgusted me so much that I had to.If you owned or played the original game, I think you would have to agree with me."
3,tic tac toe,"very excited to find this toy. i remember it as a kid. although I also remember it being better plastic I guess. a little on the flimsy side. kids seem to like it. wish the bean bags were a little heavier. although the picture shows blue. when it came in the mail it was a purple base (not blue) and green cubes (not yellow) and the stickers are pink and yellow. thank goodness I have a girl and not a boy. I don't think he would have been happy with those girly colors. otherwise, this product is just ok."
5,Still lots of fun.,I played this game 40 years ago and it was fun. I play with my 8year old Granddaughter and the fun hasn't changed. She loves it and finds is suspenseful anticipating what the bags are going to do. I found it easy to assemble and it's seems sturdy. I remembered it being a bit larger though my memory may be faulty. I wish it had a pocket to keep the bags in so they don't get separated from the game.
2,This toy doesn't work too well. My kids were bored fast.,The x's and o's don't turn over too well. It makes the game a lot longer than it should be. Don't waste your money.
5,Always a great toy,my kids love this. They are alittle young to understand the tic tac toe part but they love competing with each other over who can spin more. I bought this because my son loves to play baggo when we go to phillies games and this kinda allows him to do the same thing and is half the price. Always a great toy.
1,"bad quality, very cheap toy","DO NOT BUY THIS!Cheap made, very cheap made,and breakable. I got this toy for Christmas but my kids don't even use it it's hard to play with."
3,"Not the same as the original, but ok","The not so good points:1. It's made in China.2. As some reviewers have noted, this game is not the same as the original. It is smaller, not built as well being made out of 100% plastic, and the X/O sections do not spin as well as the original game.3. You have to add the X and O letters via stickers to the spinners. This is a bit of a pain and you must be careful not to tear the stickers when pealing them off of the sheet they are on and of course put them on nice and straight for a neat looking game.4. Maybe it's the new generation, but I've found that children (any even myself) find this game fun at first then after a couple of weeks near total interest is lost.The positive points:1. Although 100% plastic and smaller, it's not that bad and still fun to play (at least for a few weeks).2. The price is right for what you get."
3,Not Like The Old Days,"Not a bad game, but just know that this is NOT the Toss Across from when you were little. They just don't make things like they used to...period!!"
4,Toss Across,The game was purchased for individuals with developmental disabilities in our day program. They seem to enjoy the game. The game arrived in good condition.
1,Unable to assemble because Mattel included wrong pieces,"I remembered this game from my own childhood and knew my son would love it. He was so excited when he saw it, then terribly disappointed when we could not assemble it. Mattel had included 3 exterior ""bar pieces"" and only one interior ""bar"" piece which made assembly impossible. When we contacted Mattel, we were informed that no replacement pieces exist. Offered money instead. What a shame that a wonderful game involving fine and gross motor skill development is not being properly manufactured/packaged, etc. What a great shame that Mattel can't provide replacement parts."
4,We liked it!,We bought for our soon to be 5 year old grandchild. It is perfect. I can be used indoors in rainy weather and on a covered patio in sunny times.
4,Sahara Quiltted Washable Underpads.,Works as stated. Only started use last month. My only complaint is the heat that is generated during its use. So remove your blankets and use a lesser cover.
5,Return From Tomorrow,One of the most beautiful experiences ever put to print. It helps life be moremeaningful and understandable. See the world and the heavens with new eyes!
5,Unforgetable..........,I can sum this review up in one sentence-trust me you will not be able to put this book down until your finished with it!
2,Return from Tomorrow,I found this testimony a little hard to believe. It made me wonder if heaven is what we want it to be. I can't believe that we leave our bodies and just travel all over the place. It didn't give me a good picture of what awaits us after death.
4,Return From Tomorrow,Provocative reading. An opportunity to see what might await us after we die. My husband has read this book so often he wore it out. This is our second copy!
5,Return from tomorrow,"This is a wonderful book of Love and Grace. I have known Dr. George Ritchie, for almost 45 years, and his story of Love and Our Christ has not dimmed in all those years. Dr. Ritchie, lives this book every day of his life. I buy 10 copies at a time and give them to friends in need. This is a wonderful book of Love and Grace. After reading this book and hearing Dr Ritchie's talks, I do not fear death, I only cry at times of death because I will miss my love ones here on earth. I know that they are in a world of Love and one day I will join them."
4,Okay but not great,"This book is better than Howard Storm's My Descent into Death but there still isn't as much substance as I would have liked. The quality of the printing is low, which makes it less pleasant to read than it would be with better printing and format. Unlike Storm's book though, it isn't just a lot of garden variety Christian preaching. It is certainly worth reading."
4,A real life situation of a man who visited life after death.,"Trying to ease a patient's fear and suspicion about death, Psychologist, George G. Ritchie, confronts him in session and tells of his own, real-life experience of life after death.Flashing back to 40 years before, George describes in depth about what happened during the near 10 minutes that he was clinically dead. Describing the details of everything that had happened from the actual ""death"" to when he ""woke up"", he was very discriptive in everything. Coming back to present, George tells what he has learned from all of this and sheds a new light on many aspects of the whole situation. This book fills curiosities that many people have about what happens, of may happen, after death. It is a very intriguing book and will keep your attention throughout."
4,Excellent little book,This is a very thought provoking book. We used it for a Sunday School lesson and it created much discussion.
3,Interesting Read,"Although I wouldn't consider this book well written or captivating, it is a very interesting story. I believe the author has experienced a tremendous event and I am glad he has chosen to share it."
2,Just okay,"First of all, I'm not sure this book is biblically based. Too much focus on disembodied spirits and not enough focus on Jesus. If you are looking for an amazing life after death story, read "" my time in heaven"" by Richard sigmund."
4,Great book,I found the book compelling and the message one well worth sharing with All people. Learning to love and serve our fellow man is the purpose of this life and the key to lasting happiness. The life experiences demonstrate this message so well and the frankness of the author in his journey of discovery is refreshing and inspirational.
5,"This present moment, in Christ","It`s all about Jesus. Why come back, why obey, why bother... Why love, why listen, why look for Jesus in the least of these? The moral might be obvious to any Christian, but the story behind the moral is perceptive, memorable, thought provoking, penetrating and vision~through~a~glass~darkly."
3,Too fundamental for me,"I bought this book because it was mentioned in an article in Ode magazine as an inspiring story of life after death. I agree that many of the messages in this book are inspiring and universal truths, ie. the importance of forgiveness, taking your attention off of yourself, etc. However, there were far too many references to fundamental Christianity for it to be meaningful to me. The universal truths mentioned in this book can be found in all religions and are not specific to Christianity, which has led me to suspect that the real intent of this book was to spread the fundamental Christian message, when that was probably not the authors intent."
2,"My Uncle's ""Vision"" A family member speaks out!","I am the nephew of George G. Ritchie. I am also an Episcopal priest in the Church of Rwanda.I have an earned doctorate in Christian Spirituality from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.My uncle's story certainly is fascinating and apparently real, the question is, ""What is the message?"" AND Does the message come from God or from some other source?While the message of Ritchie's NDE is a bit more palatable to people who believe the Bible is God's Word in this small book, compared to his later work, ORDERED TO RETURN, let me tell you the problem of his message.1. Ritchie denigrates Scripture2. Ritchie believes in reincarnation3. Ritchie believes that man's ultimate destiny is to become a god.4. Ritchie believes that his experience is more authoritative than Scripture.5. Ritchie's account is not consistent with that of Betty Eadie, Dannion Brinkley or other NDE'rs. Who is right?"
2,Will pass,"I was thinking about taking a chance on this book when I read one of the reviews mentioning how the book talks about ""hell"" and I was immediately turned off. I don't believe in that age-old scare-tactic to keep people in line. I'm going to stick with my Sylvia Browne books. At least she admits there is no such place as ""hell"", and no God would ever send someone there even if there were such a place."
5,Would not return this this.....,"Wonderful book. I got a lot of inspiration from this book. It gave me a new way of looking at my faith, the reasons for my faith. ( even a few sermon ideas. A must read!"
1,Terrible,"Won't charge anymore. Had the battery since June, 2010, charged it twice and now it won't charge."
2,Could be better,"I bought this battery to replace a spare battery for my canon 40D. it performs well and charges without any issues. but it doesnt hold as much of a charge as my oem canon battery. from what i notice, i can probably get about 500 shots off one charge. i feel like it self discharges very quickly too. i can leave my canon battery in the body for a week without seeing much loss of charge, but this battery seems to suffer more in the same scenario. either way, it makes a very good spare.REVISE:I don't think this battery is reliable anymore. There looks to be some ""charring"" on the bottom the surface of the battery, possibly burn marks from over heating. Was worth the few months of use, but would not recommend because of possible damages to your camera."
4,Cannon D10 Battery,"Nice battery, came a bit slowly without special shipping. Like many, this one wanted to stick in the camera and had to be extracted with tape and small tools, then sanded a little to prevent a repeat.I'd buy this battery again since the problem (pretty frequent, actually) is caused by a ""batch"" in manufacturing, not the sellers or users.Cheers,"
1,"Didn't last even for a year, Poor customer service","Bought his battery in Aug 2008. It worked okay while it was holding the charge, but when it was getting close to a year it became impossible to take even 10 shots with this fully charged battery. I emailed their customer service asking for a replacement as it was well within the warranty period ( 3 years), but never heard back from them. After this experience, I'll never buy any product form this company. I replaced this battery with the Sterlingtek battery which is still working superbly after 2 years."
5,Great battery!,Bought this battery in June 2010 as a spare for my Canon 30D. It works as well or better than the original and charges on the original Canon charger. I have no issues to report. Battery has performed as well as expected. You can feel confident in replacing or adding to your Canon BP511.
3,Good for V-Day,"I could recommend this slim volume as a nearly perfect Valentine's Day gift based almost on the attractive appearance and reasonable price, alone. The content has merit as well, and I'm basically glad I read it. As I look at the reviews above, I find I agree with all of them- both the positive and the negative: they say the same things. Ondaatje hasn't written verse for fourteen years, devoting himself mostly to well-crafted prose fiction, and it shows. He has good control of topic and theme, an eye for detail and incident, and a very sensual command of the language. Any verse-craft is not at all in evidence- but it's easy reading in any case, so it is as much as most people may care."
5,Visual Learner,"If ""a picture could say a thousand words"", this book is it. I am an LPN turned Medical Coder. The book has made Anatomy `come alive'. I struggled through 2 anatomy/physiology classes in the above 2 programs & still did not feel like I understood. If you are a visual learner, this book is a must. It does have to be supplemented with written text as others have said, I use a google search when my textbooks are not enough. To determine if this book would be helpful, think of it like this, if you put together a big entertainment center, which would you find more helpful: diagrams of where each screw, nut & bolt gets attached to what piece, OR by reading a description of each piece & the description of the piece it gets attached to. For me its diagrams, so the book for me was well worth the cost ($69 + tax at Barnes & Noble, 3rd edition, soft cover)."
3,the standard,Kind of the standard at my school. Everyone knows who netter is. I guess Grays is out of their price range
5,A fantastic resource,"Frank Netter, M.D. created approximately 20,000 paintings of the human body and provided countless medical students with an invaluable educational resource. He can be credited for teaching multiple generations of doctors worldwide. Although he is now deceased, his legacy continues to provide students with intricate knowledge that only a physician and gifted artist could have given. I am thrilled to have purchased what I consider an educational necessity for such a reasonable price."
3,hmm,Self-explanatory. Bought and used for anatomy. Raving reviews were convincing! I'm happy with it. Very colorful and detailed. Worthy if one is a visual learner
1,damaged DVD,"I was not able to view this DVD. The begining credits scolled repeatedly, but I could not get it to actually play."
1,RIPOFF ALERT,I was interested in purchasing 100 of these batteries. When i got to the checkout portion of the transaction they (amazon or the storefront) wanted to charge me $500 for shipping. That is highway robbery.You are far better off going to the local Radio Shack and paying $4.99 per battery. You save $0.02 and support your local economy.just my $0.02
1,Lithium battery comes dead,"The CMOS battery I ordered was DOA. A waste of 10$, just go to the local drugstore and pick up the duracell version in the battery isle, I got a two battery pack for less than 7$"
1,Not as described,The description for this item said it was for a multi or single gang switch. It is only for a single gang switch.
5,Genuinely Delighted!,"Yeah, compared to the horror movies from the late 50's (Hammer Studio productions and Psycho) to today's in-your-face horror, these films are like strange dreams; but to daydreamers like me they are a wondrous haven from reality and reality-based TV/movies. As long as a picture says a thousand words, and famous art is to be viewed and savored again and again, then that's where you'll find me on restless weekend nights with my provisions and my remote, steeped in the wistful tranquility these classics bring. I'm truly looking forward to these gems. I only hope Warner sticks to its release date. Happy Halloween - 2005!"
4,The Val Lewton Collection,"This is a terrific collection that I just purchased. I have always considered Cat People and The Body Snatcher to be two of my favorite classic horror movies. I am just getting aquainted with some of the other titles in the collection. The main reason that I'm writing this review is for more technical reasons. The DVD transfer are good for most of the films, but I am disappointed with the transfer of The Body Snatcher. I find it to be too dark compared with the copy I recorded off Turner Classic Movies recently. The Turner Classic Movie copy is superior to the DVD copy. Perhaps my copy is defective, but I find that unlikely. Despite my disappointment with The Body Snatcher, the Val Lewton Collection is an excellent collection, and it is a definite bargain."
5,I'm watching B&W RKO movies from the 40's and loving it???,"I'm a gen Xer and if you had told me I would be enjoying RKO movies from the 40's at any point in my life I would've called you crazy, but these films are so captivating, well written and just beautiful I compulsively watched the whole set in 3 days. I know most people of my generation and younger wouldn't even give films like this a chance based on there age and being B&W, but of course that is what makes them so wonderful, the shadows, mood and tension of the films would never work in color. The stories, language, and lessons in the films really hold up as does the strikingly beautiful visuals and tension. I bought this set, finding it at a great price on sale, and based on the scary names of the movies and picture on the box, expecting monsters and ghosts, and classic fright feast stuff, what I got instead was some of the most captivating, well paced, intelligent, and lovely suspense films I've ever seen."
5,The Val Lewton Horror Collection,"While the plots alone are enough to distinguish Lewton's brand of horror from other practitioners--a mysterious Serbian beauty might or might not have the ability to transform herself into a panther in ""Cat People,"" a death-haunted New York woman is pursued by a cabal of satanists in ""The Seventh Victim""--these films are also masterpieces of noir atmospherics. Karloff, an intellectual bored by ghoulish makeup, emerged from semi-retirement to make three pictures with Lewton: ""Bedlam,"" ""The Body Snatcher,"" and ""The Isle of the Dead,"" with Bela Lugosi. It was a fruitful relationship. And this omnibus collection amply demonstrates Lewton's pulpy, lurid genius."
4,DVD Old movies,"The movies of course are dated, but fascinating also. The picture quality was excellent as was the sound. The main iterest was in seing how much movie stories have changed. Now even the simplest movie, regardless of the subject has an edge. These ""horror"" movies of the 40s-50s are gentler, less scary, with a clear statement of good and evil. Now we view things differently without any absolute judgments. Clarity has given way to a more unsettled world."
5,Elegant horror,"Steven Spielberg and Brian DePalma should be locked in a closet with a projection screen and forced to watch these films repeatedly until they swear an oath to imitate them. Made on what Tom Cruises' cleaning bill for one day's shoot would be adjusted for 1940 dollars, and infinitely superior to anything they have done. ""Curse of the Cat People"" and ""The Seventh Victim"" are largely unknown but the best and most subtle of these works. Less is more, I only wish there were more of them."
3,Amazing Films - Poor Restoration Job,"Horror films don't get any better than these nine Val Lewton classics. ""Cat People"", ""Zombie"" and ""Seventh Victim"" are the standouts, but they're all head and shoulders above most genre material.Unfortunately, the quality of the releases is very disappointing. Speckled and damaged prints, unsteady images, dodgy compression, even poor sound on some of the titles. I agree with another reviewer of this set, Warner Brothers usually take great care over their releases, and this isn't up to their standard. Even the cardboard box is lousy!If you're into classic horror, you've got to buy this anyway - but we'll have to wait for the definitive edition."
4,Scariest thing Boris Karloff ever did.,"With the continuous advances in production values of movies, sometimes it is hard to appreciate films done with old technology or in the stylization of bygone eras. I think this movie shows that talent will out. That a good artist takes the technology he has and makes good art with it.The old black and white images are art in themselves and lend them selves to the eeriest atmosphere since Nosferatu. The stylized acting gives the whole film an aura of brooding menace. I personally think this was the scariest thing that Boris Karloff ever did. I think it shows that monsters do not have to be super powered or supernatural to be horrifying.It is probably not a film for younger people, but if you are a mature person who can appreciate material of different nature from a bygone age, this is a forgotten gem and well worth a viewing."
5,Another great nite of old fashioned horror,"Again, I absolutely love the old horror movies better than the new ones.This collection is one of the best you can own by one of the best director's ever. I watch my horror films on Friday nites - that's my designated night for horror - all I need is rain. Don't miss this set if you like the old movies - it's absolutely great and great fun to watch and to remember and yes, it will scare you in the old fashioned way. A must for all horror fans."
5,Val Lewton Horror Collection,This collection of horror movies was excellent. I had seen most of them when I was a child and if you like old movies I think you would really enjoy these. They are classics.
4,Hugely enjoyable,"The Ghost Ship is a real clunker. It underlines the skill of a director and cast who can produce tension, interest and mystery by showing what happens when that skill is absent.All the rest, though, are marvellous entertainment and, in my view, fine pictures. The set is good value and money well spent."
3,"Decent, at best","I have been a fan of Autopilot Off for awhile and have seen them in concert several times. I really like their older music. I found it fast and original and catchy. I think this new CD is definitely a new direction for them. The songs are much deeper sounding, but they are not as fast or as hard, and I feel just not quite as good as their other stuff. I would recommend getting some of their older music like their last EP with songs like ""Long Way to Fall"", ""Wide Awake"", ""Exit Signs"", and ""Nothing Frequency""."
3,"Extra Track, No Pilot.","""Make A Sound"" harmonious alt-rock album with acoustic piano and driving rhythm guitars. Released on Island records, the invasive sound of the lead guitar moves in tandem with Johnson's voice; drawing a proverbial parallel line in the recording. The mastering and mixing reminds me of heavier metal albums simply due to the amount of technicalities taken, but ties the instruments together well. Autopilot Off consists of Chris Johnson on vocals and guitar, Chris Hughes on guitar, Bob Kucharek on bass, and Phil Robinson on Drums. The album was produced with the exception of track 9 by Greg Nori, and has been released simultaneously in Japan with an extra bonus track. Check out the band's website at www.autopilotoff.com - Brett Lemke"
1,more pop punk junk,"boy these guys suck. i heard them on the Daredevil soundtrack and then i saw them at a show. all their songs sound the same. i'm sure 14 year old girl like them because they are cute. the good thing is we'll never have to hear from these guys because this Sum 41, Good Charlotte crap is almost over, and thankfully Autopilot Off was too late in the game to join. I guess they'll have to keep rocking on at their parent's house forever. losers."
4,Very Nice...,"This is pop-punk at its finest, with deep lyrics and catchy melody...get this if you like Fall Out Boy, NFG or Go Betty Go..."
4,Catchy Stuff,"This album does not seem to distinguish itself from the many other bands, but I do like it. The catchy tunes keep me on an emotional roller-coaster but don't lead me to destroy everything in sight. The singer doesn't scream and that's the only draw-back. Island Def Jam is an incredible record label, with this band, Hoobastank, Thursday and one of the best bands : THRICE!! Don't forget about THRICE!!!"
5,Business Card Case,"When my niece received the card case she called me and said it was nice, she stated it was a perfect color, it went well with her new cards. The quality of the leather was good and she really appreciated it."
4,Helpful book,I was looking for a resource that would help me make arguments in both the written word and the spoken word. This book is an excellent resource for both.It was in good condition and it arrived on time.I recommend the seller.
2,Unnatural,"This book relies too much on science at the expense of common sense. It makes extensive use of Splenda, egg substitutes, butter-oil replacement, and low-fat/non-fat cheese, sour cream, whipped cream, etc. If that appeals to you, then you will like this book. If you prefer natural food, like I do, then this book is not what you're looking for."
5,"My sisters (good cooks, all) loved this book.",My 'feedback' (pun intended) from my sisters that they found out from this book why certain foods and recipies were healthy. They enjoy this cookbook.
1,Not Essential and Not Business,"I knew this was a skinny little book when I ordered it so I cannot fault the brevity that characterizes this booklet. What I do find fault with is the excessive detail given to one's appearance and the lengthy discourse on wine tasting. This book has 46 pages of instruction; thirteen devoted to personal appearance and seven devoted to wine. With four pages of illustration this leaves very little space for what could be considered Business Etiquette. Most of the actual advice offered is sound, if shallow and incomplete. I object to the suggestions that people with southern accents or nasal voices should take diction lessons. Also disturbing was the chapter titled Interviewing Techniques that lists four ""items necessary to ensure a positive interview."" The fourth necessary item is to not be overweight. I could not in good conscience recommend this book to anyone needing serious advice on business manners."
2,Can't calibrate it!,"It looks good and it is said that it does wonders, but I can't calibrate it. I have tried many times but it fails on me. And their tech support is hard to reach."
2,"Not the best subject, not the greatest casebook","This is just TOO much, TOO soon for people just entering law school. EXTREMELY dry, and way too much info before the previous concepts have been explained clearly enough. Some chapters are better than others, but overall it's a headache. Perfect for law profs and treatise writers, confusing for the regular 1L."
2,Poor case editing,"Great case selection, but poor editing. Way too much irrelevant material. As I have personal experience with Prof Marcus, I have to think it's the fault of the other two junior casebook authors. Marcus himself gives incredibly succinct answers to complex questions. My suggestion if you have problems with the book is to email him a question!"
5,It's love him or hate him,"Midge is one of the very few artists that truly either touches your soul or annoy you, depending on what kind of person you are. I'm glad to belong to category one - this album is a great compilation of what Midge stands for, certainly a must have for any fan. He has a voice, a message and a soul to make you listen."
5,"No Children, No Pets",I loved this book when I was a girl. I remember re-reading it several times. I liked the interactions between the kids and especially was intrigued by the little mystery. This is a wonderful book for both boys and girls.
5,Best Protein Drink Available,I have tried many protein drinks and I would have to say the Spiru-tein is the best tasting of them all!
5,Love the flavor,"This, the tangerine dream and the cherry jubilee are my favorite flavors. It really helps to have a blender bottle for these shakes. It mixes them with no clumps and because of the real fruit pieces in them you don't want to use a blender. Also I have made many orders through the vitamin shoppe and have never had any problems."
2,Too Sweet,I didn't like this flavor at all but you may. I found it way too sweet and the extra sugar over the Chocolate and Vanilla flavors is not needed. It seemed very artificial.
3,Review of Civil War Small Arms,"A small, but good start on Civil War arms.The book will give some information, but it is not a large text book.Moose"
4,Excellent Crystal info -- but no pictures,"If you are already familiar with Crystals, but want more in-depth information on properties, legends, and histories, then this is a book for you! However, this book has no pictures, and only limited info. on using crystals."
3,Great food for Expert Cooks!,"This book offers book great tasting recipes, very well explained. If you're a competent cook looking for delicious vegan projects to bring your skills up a notch, this is the book for you! However, this is not a book that the average cook is going to find easy to use. Unless you are already a real expert in the kitchen, these complex recipes are going to be reserved for special treats only. Many take several hours to prepare. But, oh what treats they'll be when you do have the time!"
5,LOVE THIS!,"I think the title suggests this is not your typical, boring, done-to-death book of vegan standards.Voluptuous to me means BIG and BOLD. Let's eat! I actually enjoy a challenge in finding ingredients. If you can't find everything get creative or get whats good in your area.I get sick of so many other books treating me like a newbie. Jeeez, it's been 20+ years already. If you consider yourself passoinate about vegan cooking you should have this book."
3,Average,"As far as vegan cookbooks go, this one was very run of the mill. What I did not like about it, was that it featured many hard to find items, not readily available in the average grocery store or even a specialty store. However even with it's hard to find items this book is very inventive, but by no means the best vegan cookbook in my collection."
3,Hit or Miss...,"I've made several things out of this cookbook, and it's really been hit or miss. Sometimes the dish is fabulous, and then other times it's just mediocre. Another complaint I have about it is the index. It's laid out as ""soups"", ""menus"" and then ""desserts"". It makes it very difficult to find anything; instead you have to browse through the book until you come across what sounds good. So if you're looking for a salad, side dish, main dish, or appetizer, set aside an hour or so if you plan on using this book. That being said, the dishes that were ""hits"" were really good. Her gingerbread is fabulous."
1,Huh???,"I am writing this review on behaf of my mother and I. My mom bought this cookbook (and returned it) about a month ago. I have been cooking vegan for quite some time, and i am always open to new, weird, or even down right fancy cooking, but i was extremely dissapointed with this book. I think, and i am NOT exaggerating here, that there was only about 5 recipes that even sounded realistic. I don't know about you, but i like to know what the heck the ingredients are (and how to pronounce them) if i am going to eat a meal. For a great vegan cookbook i would recommend The Mcdougall Quick and Easy cookbook (it has over 300 low fat meals you can prepare in under 15 minutes!) I am not an advocate of low fat, or Dr. Mcdougall...but this book comes in handy for us working wives/mothers!"
2,Not much I wanted to cook,"I have bought several vegan cookbooks recently, and like this one the least of all. I only found two recipes in it that I was even vaguely interesting in preparing.Try Vegan Vittles by Joanne Stepaniak, or any number of other vegan choices, but this one isn't worth the effort."
1,Bland not Voluptuous,"After trying five recipes from this book - all of which we tasted and threw away, I am wondering if the author actually tasted any of these dishes. We found them bland and unappetizing. The combination of spices and ingredients is tantalizing, but the final product is bland and unsavory. The Curried Chickpea tart was heavy and had no curry taste. The Cauliflower-Fennel sauce was flavorless. The directions are not detailed enough. I was unsure about most of the recipes I tried, the process was nothing like the author had described. Very frustrating introduction to vegan cooking."
3,Predictable and lengthy...,"Although this collection of short horror stories starts out with a bang, I found that the concept grew old quickly. Each story is more anticlimactic than the preceding one, with very few surprises in store as the main characters are brutally sliced, diced, and otherwise disfigured. The characters themselves are horribly underdeveloped, with no sense of backstory or motivation whatsoever, so it is rather difficult to feel anything but indifference to their situation. Where is the drama? Certainly nowhere to be found, in this collection."
2,Scavenger hunt,"Although we are experienced in international vegetarian cooking, we were completely put off by the abundance of unfamiliar ingredients in many of Kornfeld's recipes. How many grocery stores or natural food stores carry pasilla or ancho chiles, yucca, kudzu, black turtle beans, asafetida, kuri squash, guajillo, epazote, anasazi beans, frisee, kaffir lime leaves, fresh galangal, or achiote seeds? The author does, at times, suggest substitutions. But after we've been forced to make multiple substitutions, we can't help but wonder how the original recipe was meant to taste."
3,"AMAZING, if you have the time to prepare these...","The recipes in this book are absolutely AMAZING and are obviously made by exquisite chefs, however, the preparation time for these dishes would be HOURS and HOURS. This is a book to use to impress a vegan date, to celebrate an occassion, or for a small dinner-party. Definitely NOT for everyday cooking for people who work, unless you want to spend over 3 hours cooking each meal. Again, the results are EXQUISITE, definitely far from bland and boring vegan."
2,not what i hoped for,"As other reviewers have said, the recipes are time consuming. I have tried the adzuki bean recipe, and it was much less tasty than I had expected. Other recipes in this book are not even worth trying because the ingredients are either seasonal or just plain unavailable in my rural area. There are better, more down-to-earth vegan cookbooks out there."
3,okaaaaaaaaaaaay,"i was not enamored with this book because most of the recipes were not ones i would use.....chickpea crepes, areapas, etc. i am new to veganism and need to focus on the basics first..."
2,not what i was looking for...,"I'm one of those people who wants to find something yummy and simple. Plenty of the recipes were yummy, but none were simple. This book is a bit more complicated than I have time for. Being a vegan is hard enough without having to run all over town looking for obscure ingredients you'll only use 1/2 teaspoon of.This would be a good book for entertaining guests and serving elaborate food, but I just wanted a book with simple skillet suppers and the like, a book I could use everyday."
3,I Can't Find the Ingredients!!!!,"While I have tried the simpler recipes, and they were good, I would not recommend this book. I live in the mountains and don't have access to specialty stores. This means I can't cook most of the recipes in the book. She calls for ingredients such as epazote, fiddlehead ferns, kabocha squash, etc., etc., etc.I can't find these things and I am not going to send off mail order just for one recipe. Spend you money on a cookbook that you will use over and over again, this isn't it."
4,For Sunday Afternoon Cooking,"Although the cover of the book is inviting you to pick it up and start reading the recipes, it's the most colourful part of the book. In other words, I miss photos of the dishes! The recipes are quite-well described and look original and delicious, but it takes some time to prepare them (and there's no time indication). So, reserve a sunday afternoon to prepare the cooking and enjoy..."
4,"Okay, I know it's early but...","I just purchased this cookbook after mulling over the reviews, and I just tried my first recipe, Warm Chickpea Salad with Artichokes and Sun-dried tomatoes. Mmmmmmm! I thought the minced rosemary used in the dressing might give this salad an overwhelming flavor, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was subtle, and wonderful, and full of flavor! Maybe I shouldn't write a review based upon my first go at it, but I have a gut feeling that I'm going to love this book! The fact that the author is a chef, and reading the other reviews, gives me faith and trust. I am an occasional vegan, and have been wanting to learn how to cook bolder, more flavorful vegan dishes. I have given in to the fact that good cooking requires time and commitment, so the effort that is needed does not turn me off. For me, the taste and the health benefits will make it totally worth the effort. I can't wait to try more recipes!!"
3,The Voluptuous Vegan,"The few recipes that I've used were exceptionally yummy, but some of the listed ingredients were exceptionally hard to find. This book is a little too gourmet for me but if you are in good range of a fully-stoked, open-minded health food store, and are up to challenge your already challenging vegan lifestyle, I say go for it. You might add something new and exciting to your vegan repertoire."
3,Only if you're a skilled chef,"This is more of a gourmet cookbook. The author is a professional chef - teaching at the Natural Gourmet Cookery School in NYC and at the restaurant Angelica Kitchen. This pretty much gears all the recipes towards experienced cooks who want to try something new (and tasty).Main courses involve 3-5 dishes. Since I generally make 1 dish (maybe 2 of there is rice or a side salad) the complexity of making 3-5 dishes for 2 people is senseless.Buy this book if you know your way around the kitchen, live in an area where you can buy unusual foods, want to expand your horizons, and are cooking for 4+ people."
2,Cure for Insomnia,"Required reading for my graduate class. Although the book covers a lot of ground, it is very shallow on the details, and even gets some of the facts wrong.For example, uses less than a page to discuss the Son Tay raid, but even in that small of a space gets one main fact wrong. Leebaert states that only satellite imagery was available. Wrong, both manned and unmanned platforms were used.Leebaert's writing style also makes the book hard to follow and comprehend. I would not recommend it for research, nor for the casual reader. Not sure why all the acclaim."
1,Needs a strong editor,"The writing in this book is jumbled, verbose and incomprehensible. It seems this book was not written, per se, but probably recorded from conversations between several knowledgeable people constantly interupting each other, without any separation among speakers. ""we recorded it, to the printer"""
5,An analysis of the impact of the commando force on history,"TO DARE AND TO CONQUER: SPECIAL OPERATIONS ND THE DESTINY OF NATIONS, FROM ACHILLES TO AL QAEDA describes not just modern-day special forces operations but the history of special ops around the world, focusing on teams of soldiers who have created and destroyed nations and empires and examining how these events have taken place. From sparks to war to politics underlying special forces both internally and internationally, chapters provide an analysis of the impact of the commando force on history, and the strategies which made special forces strong.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,pumped,"I love Amy's all pump xtreme. Everything is well executed, she loves what she does and it shows. She uses different types of loads, from dumb bells, bar bells to bands. Very well done and challenging."
5,Great Classic Toy,"For any child that loves Curious George, this is the plush toy to get. I bought this toy for my son 2 1/2 years ago (he's now almost 5 years old) and it's still his favorite to sleep and travel with. Very soft and lovable - not too big and not too small."
5,Love it Love it Love it!!!,"Okay so... I loved the IDEA of a coffee press and had purchased a less expensive option from a local store and always ended up chewing the last bit of my coffee. I've had the Planetary Designs Mug Press (Iris, WHAT A COLOR) for a month now and have used it EVERY day with nary a chewy bit! I even took it on vacation with relatives who like colored water that they call coffee and for ONCE, I didn't care. I had MY coffee the way I liked it every time. It fits well in my van's adjustable cup holder and I've never had a problem with it spilling. The well is deep enough in the lid that as long as you're not filling it so that coffee comes up through the spout, there shouldn't be a problem with overflow. Love Love Love this mug! I'm planning to buy some as Christmas gifts for my friends who like fresh coffees and herb teas."
2,Poorly written,This is a surprisingly poorly written textbook. One can tell that more and more information has simply been cut and pasted into this book over the years. The continuity and organization of the book suffers. The authors (or a new author) should consider writing a new text from scratch --- one that encompasses the entire field of substance abuse counseling more comprehensively.
2,Could Use a Proofreader,"It is necessary to note that this book is required for CADC licensure in some certification programs. As such, it is so poorly written and organized, I am finding it difficult to get through it. I am disappointed to have paid significant money for what is assumably quality research and information about substance use and abuse, presented in a manner that is careless and disorganized. There are innumerable grammatical errors and the author lacks focus and consistancy within paragraphs. It is inexcusable to read a ""textbook,"" where basic sentence structure and writing is neglected. While the information contained is assumably valid and of great value, its presentation is lacking at best. I hope that future additions are more cost effective and adhere to a higher standard of professional educational writing."
4,Good buy,We ordered this book for the price and we were extremely pleased with the quality. It did take almost 3 weeks to arrive after I received the shipped confirmation which seemed a little long.
4,Worthwhile read,"This was the main text for a class I was taking. I am not sure that I feel it is appropriate as a master's text book, but it is an interesting read and a book that can be used as a resource. The writing is clear and the information is easy to comprehend."
5,A required source book for addictions counselors.,This is a well written and comprehensive resource for the practicing addictions counselor as well as those just starting out. There is no better single source of information on the process and treatment of alcoholism and drug addiction and I have continued to use this book long after passing the written exam and becoming licensed.
3,Makita Finder/driver,"This is a great little tool for the home use, however, the hex driver does not hold up to heavy use. Makita has changed this product so that a commercial hex driver bit will no longer fit the barrel. So if you are looking for a home tool I would recommend this item. If you are a commercial user that needs the hex driver, plan on replacing this item often."
2,Not Meant As A Walkabout Front Lens Cap,"The E-145 Front Lens Cap only fits one way onto a reversed ET-120 lens hood. The hard plastic Lens Cap inside the drawstring vinyl flapped sheath can unglue itself. Walking around with the E-145 affixed to the reversed hood will certainly result in it's loosening and dropping to the ground if one is not careful. In my opinion, the Cap is only good for storage of the lens inside it's hard case.Please refer to my uploaded photos."
5,great!,this product is great! it is also very easy to use i reccomend sony over any other company that makes mini discs.
4,works fine,"Seems to be well made, probably very durable. I'm using it for very light duty, on angle grinder wheel locking nuts. So, this tool should last me forever. It is a little stiff working, out of the box, but some light, dry lubricant fixed that.It is rather more expensive than I would expect, for such an uncomplicated tool. For light duty use, I also have this wrench,Adjustable Pin Wrench, which is a pretty good value, in my opinion."
4,Do The Job,"There is nothing fancy about this tool, but it does what it needs to do. Amazon had the best price I could find on an American made tool. It's what I was looking for, at a good price."
5,The best,"If you love Kat, you will love this. Has some of my favorites! I liked this better because it has multiple movies in it, not just one."
4,Katt Pack,"Katt Williams is hilarious! I took off a star because I thought this was going to be all stand-up, which I prefer to movies, but I still love it!"
5,KATT,love katt williams and the boyfriend and i laugh histerically everytime we watch it. Came way before estimated date very pleased with purchase
5,Katt Pack,"What can I say about this DVD set. This cat is one of the funniest comedians on the planet.If want to forget your troubles, stress, and just want to just chill. Put on a Kat Williams show on and you will laugh your but off."
2,and the color?,"is a good movie but is not in colour, if u are a big fan of Negrete and trying to find the color movie, i tell you that this is not."
2,not expected from Aiden,"ok, first off, i loved Nightmare Atonamy! It is one of my favorite albums. Aiden is a great band, but to keep this short and to sum it up. If you like scream-o Aiden like me, i would not suggest buying conviction. its an OK cd, but there is no screaming, and its more of a bunch of love songs etc. put together on their cd. i like the cd, but not one of my favorites."
1,From Horror to bubble gum,"Barf barf ralph and barf. There needs to be a sticker for bands that tried to be horror rock, and then completely sell out and sing about how terrible it is to pine away for the prom queen. The only horror left with this band, is what they are selling now as their music. Oh, and that horrible vomit taste in my mouth. Yuck."
4,Gift recipient gives great review,I purchased this as a gift and the recipient loves it. She loves the color and said it makes the best coffee.
4,Perkins' 14,"Officer Dwayne Hopper discovers that he may have the man that kidnapped his son ten years earlier locked up in one of his cells. After interrogating the man and sending a friend to investigate his home, Hopper unwittingly unleashes his prisoner's fourteen victims, whose years of torture and drug exposure have turned them into feral killers! What begins as a suspenseful play on the familiar SILENCE OF THE LAMBS motif quickly descends into a bloody survival Horror film with unexpected thrills. PERKINS' unlikeable characters manage to garner the audience's support when they are faced with the unstoppable PCP-induced teens. Craig Singer brings a frenetic energy to the attack sequences, which include a number of inventive deaths (the most memorable of which involves a black screen broken only by the light of a flashlight as it hammers into a policeman's skull repeatedly). The film is a welcome surprise out of the After Dark Horrorfest III!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
3,Good Story,"This was a good story for a sequel. Overall, Marjane brought us back to the world of her youth and recaptured the changing feelings toward a culture unfamiliar to most. With humor, wit, and thoughtfulness I enjoyed the book--however, it left me with a less than happy ending (but isn't that life?)."
5,Even better than first Persepolis,"Marjane Satrapi is reminescent of Marcel Marceau, the famous French mime, able to tell incredible stories visually by touching our hearts through our eyes.Wonderful!"
3,Decent Followup,"This book continues where Persepolis left off with Marjane returning home from Austria to attend college. She's returning home to witness the aftermath of the war. The novel wasn't as good as the firs for it focuses on her college relationship with her boyfriend, and basically has a lot of boring parts to it. But, it's a decent followup"
5,sequel to the author's Persepolis graphic novel,"I was enthusiastic about reading this sequel to Persepolis because I enjoyed the first volume so much. Satrapi uses a simple (but not simplistic) black and white style that is quite expressive as she tells the story of her life after returning to her home in post-Revolution Iran from schools in Europe. The book details the difficulties she faced as a woman and as a citizen, and continues through her marriage.Enlightening and entertaining. Highly recommended."
4,"Poignant, in black and white","The second book of Marjane Satrapi's memoir is not quite as riveting as the first (just like teenagers are not as fascinating as children), but it is still excellent reading and a necessary companion to Persepolis I. Satrapi's insight and sensibility on Iran, Europe and the lot of the immigrant - never to be at home anywhere - is remarquable. Like Persepolis I, I could not put it down before I had finished it."
5,BEST EVER,"This is the only book that I have manged to read the entire of it in one day!It is a comic book, supper easy read and very educational in terms of knowing different culture.I like Persepolis 2 better than 1.U may wanna watch the movie, as well. It won and nominated for many awards in 2007."
5,Awesome!,"Awesome follow-up toPersepolis: The Story of a Childhood. Engrossing memoir about the price you pay for emigration, the price you pay for freedom.I want to read more from Marjane so I already boughtChicken with Plums.P.S: This is not a graphic novel for children."
2,Marginally useful,I found it easier to enter equations from other references as I used them and became familiar with them. Simply entering the equations from this book doesn't mean you know how to find or use them.
5,A humble man of incredible events,"General Twining's account is more than first-person as that portends one who witnessed history. He made it on Guadalcanal. This book is a superior account for one who desires to understand how war plans are made, how to train a unit and how to motivate men to do what is not normally done. He treats us to an excellent first-person insight of how one plans, equips, trains, and leads in combat. It is not a book from someone who sits in an ivory tower and has a better way of doing business. Finally, he reminds us of why we have Marines. A force that truly is ready to do our nations dirty business so we can stay free and secure."
3,A GOOD ACCOUNT BY ONE OF THE TOP MARINES INVOLVED...,"For those deeply involved in reading about the Guadalcanal campaign during World War II, this book is MUST reading (five stars) since it presents the ""inside"" story by one of the major U.S. Marine Crops officers (Twining) participating in the campaign from the beginning until the Army took over. For the average reader, however, the account is not spell-binding and even weak in that the author notes that many early campaign records were purposely destroyed when it appeared the Marines might have to evacuate. - Keeping in mind that this is not a broad historical account such as Richard Franks' ""Guadalcanal: The Definitive Account..."", but rather a Marine participant's journal, it is very good down-to-earth substantiating reading and provides a lot of local color and personalities that the writer can place in an autobiographical piece that a professional author concerned with history will in most cases ignore. Nice reading."
3,Pierce Deluxe Doll House Kit,The instruction are adequate enough to assemble the doll house and it looks pretty neat when it's all together. The only thing that I did not necessarly like was the thin panels (larger sheets were warpped) and the die cutting of the punch out parts (to ragged and splintered edges). I guess I expected something of a little more professional in the design of the kit.
1,CRAPPY!,This is a horrible product! Save your money and make it yourself! The suction cups do not adhere to the MARBLE in my bathroom! The bag itself is cheap! Your better off keeping bath time toys in a bucket than this thing! The fact that I even had to give it one star is way to many stars!!
4,Love!,I love this bag. I actually use it for a diaper bag for my 19 month old daughter. It's not too big and I can put her sippy cups in the side compartments.
2,Charged me $12 to return (restocking fee),The straps are too long even when adjusted to the tightest position. Hangs past my waste and I am a tall person. Also too casual for me to use as a work bag. Might be good for traveling and camping trips. May hold/show dirt easily though so I don't know.
2,Very high level view,"This book restates in somewhat clearer terms what the standard SAP documentation will tell you. It does not address the underlying principles of Project Management. The reader expected a treatise on Project Management and how SAP supports the various philosophies, strategies, tactics and techniques, instead, the writer merely glosses over the project management aspects and writes a series of explanations of SAP functionality within the Project System module. A better title would have been ""SAP R/3 Project System - The Basic Functions"". For the reader that does not have access to SAP documentation (avaliable free from SAP), or is interested in reviewing the standard delivered functions of the Project System module, this book covers the basics..."
2,The dictionary of human geography,"This book gives very long convoluted answers to terms commonly seen in human geography. For someone who is a researcher and enthusiastic and patient this book may be wonderful, but most students are better of getting another dictionary of geography such as the Oxford Dictionary of Geography."
5,Everywhere in Mississippi,Excellent book for children and adults who have an interest in Mississippi towns and their unusual names. I bought 4 books to send to my grandchildren who live in Michigan and Oregon. Their Mothers are native Mississippians!!
4,Mother of Two,"As of April 2007, Target has this set and Set ""B""(?), each for $19.99. Too bad one set doesn't have all the rangers, but that's marketing for you. These are mini figures (approx. 3"" tall), vinyl or soft plastic, and the boys love playing with them--thank goodness they're all waterproof!"
2,Too many errors,I'm more than half way through the SQL Server Administration practice questions and I've found too many incorrect answers to recommend this book.
2,Design Jet in name only,"I bought this printer a few years ago, it has been to the repair shop no less than 3 times. I had the warranty and HP did a good job with shipping me printers (so I give it 2 stars), but alas it quit again the other day and no more warranty, so no more printer. Images fade, it doesn't print quite photographically, and it requires a degree to figure out some of the functions. Not to mention it can bleed ink all over on the best setting."
2,Just Don't.,"I bought this book with the intention of using it in my research about women's roles in the 13th century German saga, the Nibelungenlied; but what a disappointment! The book is badly written, boring, and lacks all creativity and/or spark.I wouldn't recommend it either as a recreational book, or as an academic resource; and if you're only interested in the basic facts of the lives of these medieval queens (who, regardless to this book, are undoubtedly fascinating), it's easier and cheaper to get them from the internet."
5,The REAL Nashville Sound!,"This is the real Nashville sound before it became over-contrived, over-arranged, over-produced, over-voiced and over the top! They didn't come any better than Carl. If I had to pick one 50's country singer to have in my collection it would be Carl Smith. And I remember them all! From the most famous to the most obscure. You have it all with this CD. A great singer, Great songs, great (simple, straight ahead) arrangements, and a great band. You can't miss! As an added bonus you get to experience one of the great steel guitar players of the era, Johnny Sibert. This was the Golden Age of the steel guitar before it got it's pedals and lost it's soul. Believe me, I'm not one to gush, but this one's a must!An easy five stars!!"
5,brother bear,My grandchildren and I have checked this out of the library at least 6 times and we love watching two and three times a day until the movie has to go back. A couple times it was overdue because the boys love it so. I find it very intertaining. Great color and animation.
3,An important archival record ... for me,"Tom Jenkins was my grandfather and this is the most comprehensive collection of his performances that I've been able to find. I have thoroughly enjoyed learning a little more about him through his music. Other listeners will find this collection to capture a unique time and place in orchestral performance but their enjoyment will be challenged by the poor quality of many of the recordings. For me, however, this disk is a priceless archival record."
2,Ditto Laura,"Laura's comments are not outrageous. While this printer DID work out of the box (on a MAC) great and I like the quality of color, speed, etc.; I have had continual problems with the Photo Conductor Units(PCU) about every 3-4 months. I've had the machine for about 16 months now, only have 8700 copies total and I've had to replace the color & B&W; each twice and the Intermediate Transfer Unit once. It's a love/hate relationship for me. So far corp. has comped things but its been like pulling teeth. They finally sent a tech out and he had probs too; so I feel confindent it wasn't just me...Great when it works, but you could buy a new machine every year for the $$$ spent on supplies---What do you think, has anyone every done THAT?"
3,Everything Seemed Psychedelic in the Early 90's,"Sun Dial are a puddle formed from the flowing spills of early-90's UK psychedelic rock (think Stone Roses), early-90's American guitar rock (think Soundgarden) and your more straightforward non-straightforward psych-rock (think Spacemen 3).It's druggy jam-born music; this collection feels a lot like what the liner notes explain it as -- product's of legendary late night party-sessions. It ain't, as one reviewer already noted, the most original psychedelic rock or essential listening. What it does offer is a more visceral approach to the psych-revival taking place in the UK at the time. Stone Roses and Inspiral Carpets are all well and good, but occasionally a little overdrive would be appreciated. For music in a VERY similar vein check out The Heads.Good enough to buy used, nothing I'd go crazy seeking out. Although it is a peculiar release for Relapse records."
2,Refried and occasionally tasty,"2 1/2Neo-Psychedelia pays worthy homage to musty stoner-rock sentiment behind bands like Hawkwind and Flying Saucer Attack, but in doing offers nothing inherently original or engrossing aside from the occasionally correct druggie production and shambolic guitar solos. When all the ramshackle, fuzzed out trippy-ness finds a center, these guys feel like they could top this genre but too often instead, Return Journey feels like it is either just building up or coming down for its own sake."
1,Mirepresentation,"The product is capable of 400W output if you were to connect it directly to a car/truck battery. If you connect it to the cigarette outlet the output is only about half. Also the unit that they sent looks less attractive than the one shown on Amazon Website. Also, Amazon claims on it website that the product is warrantied for 1 year. The product documentation says 6 months."
2,Weak Product,"I bought this unit for a trip to Alaska in my RV which has deep cycle batteries intended for repeated recharging. . The inverter works fine as long as the engine is running but when parked, the inverter's alarm goes off when the incoming voltage is 11.5 V. That makes it pretty useless for most of my needs."
1,shorts if connected wrong,"I used this inverter several times and it was fine. Then I accidentally hooked it to the battery in reverse polarity. Yes, I know this was dumb, but mistakes happen.Here is what the manual says for diagnosing problems:""The AC load will not operate. Digital display is off.""Possible Cause: ""The inverter has been connected with reverse DC input polarity.""Solution: ""Check connection to battery. The inverter has likely been damaged and needs to be repaired. Have the unit repaired (not covered under warranty).""Seriously? There is no need for the unit to blow itself up because it was hooked up wrong, that is what voltage protection circuitry is for. Xantrex obviously knows this will be a problem and yet haven't designed for it.As I said, the unit worked fine until I misread the battery connections..."
1,A Piece of C%$#p,"I bought this item and after only a few weeks the velcro snaps fell down and the snug fit wore off, making it impossible to use this junk anymore. Don't buy this!!!!"
1,Kroo Armband Poor Quality,"I have used the armband 5 times while exercising and already the Velcro tabs are coming off. I had to trash the armband because 4 of the tabs are gone. It may be suitable for jogging, but I don't recommend it. The plastic is not clear and you really have to pull it down to see the screen. I'm really disappointed with this product."
1,Want cheap? Look no further.,"This armband barely covers my player. With this in mind, my Zen now has several scratches around the edges because the Kroo armband just doesn't provide sufficient protection. The velcro tidbits DO begin to fall off with minimal use. I've already lost one or two of them. They are only glued to the foamy substance that constructs the body of the case. The plastic screen is foggy, making it not so clear when glancing at the screen while jogging, lifting or whatever. Lastly, the pouch is poorly designed. The arm straps pull at the bottom corners of the plastic screen protector causing it to disconnect with the armband to a great degree. I love my Zen, but I recommend finding an armband or case that is STITCHED, not glued with Elmer's."
1,JUNK OF A PRODUCT,"I recently ahd bought this item. Came with company defect. I live overseas. Left possitive feedback for the item prior receiving, due to the fact of the fast service of shipping.When product arrived needed to buy so many atributes to hook up to receive sound and finally is defect. Shipping cost to high to send back.Please look for a other product leave this one just as it is.Bad product"
4,Worth listening to again...and again!,"Emanuel Ax tackles one of the most inventive and challenging sets of variations ever written for the piano, the Handel Variations, Op. 24, by the young Johannes Brahms. This was my first introduction to this remarkable composition and I have received many hours of enjoyable listening from this CD. The Six Piano Pieces, Op. 118 and the two piano Rhapsodies, Op. 79 are also masterfully played. Well worth the asking price! By the way, if you love the ""Handel Variations"" by Brahms like I do, also check out Max Reger's ""Variations and Fugue on a Theme by G.P. Telemann"", another large scale and similarly exquisite set of piano variations (Marc-Andre Hamelin has recorded an excellent version of this latter work on the Hyperion label)."
5,MASTERPIECE!,"I can't say enough about this CD and how it has inspired me! It is a complete masterpiece! Not since I was a little kid being tucked into bed have I been so enchanted by a captivating story. Brenda Wong Aoki's voice is as sweet and soothing as it is powerful. Now take this already amazing spoken word masterpiece and accompany it with an equally amazing musical score, composed by Bassist, Mark Izu. To me, it centers in a Jazzy place, but constantly ventures out into an assortment of styles breaking all barriers of genre and classification. I've got to give credit to each of the musicians for helping make this piece come to life and affect me so profoundly. The Queen's Garden has given me new artistic inspiration and Brenda Wong Aoki's name is now and forever on my list of influences."
3,A sunny Britpop sing-along. Great debut.,"The more I listen to this CD, the more I find it difficult to narrow-down the myriad of influences I hear. An extraordinary UK release bubbling under music radar in North America. 'It Doesn't Matter Anymore' combines a hybrid of Britpop and glam hit by sunny-dewed harmonies. Confused? Just think Jellyfish meets Oasis, Dodgy meets The Brian Jonestown Massacre, or Brian Wilson's take on mid-90's Britpop. The indie-rock sounds are obvious on the Supernaturals debut, but add to the formula a retro 60's feel (typical of bands from the Elephant Six label) combined with a T Rex-type swagger. What stands-out are these colorful backing harmonies, breezy ooo's and ahh's that draw from Jellyfish, Super Furry Animals and Sloan, to early Beatles and The Who. 'It Doesn't Matter Anymore' is glossy sun-drenched power-rock, seeping of glam attitude, with infectious 60's melodies. There's something in this CD for everyone."
3,Great storyline but ...,I like this author and the storyline has great potential. But the writing does not flow well or smoothly. I still finished the book but glad I did not have to spend money.
3,"Good Christian romance, but lacked depth.","Mixed Blessings by Cathy Marie Hake was a good Christian romance. It is a parents worse nightmare, you discover the child you have loved for years isn't yours - now what. You have a child of the heart and not of the flesh. The author takes us on a journey of blending two families, however, It was a short journey. This could have been a fantastic novel, but fell short, due to lack of depth. This definitely was not the author's best work, it just seemed too rushed."
4,Fabulous loafer!,Gorgeous shoe -- very classic design without being chunky -- reasonably comfortable -- runs a little small
3,Dolphin family ring,"I bought this ring as a replacement for one my husband bought me about 10 yrs ago. I love the ring, the only problem was the tri- color on the ring did not last long, but I still love it and wear it all the time."
5,Great Way to Understand the King James mumbojumbo,This book by an extremely talented author helps the rest of us understand what Christ was (is) all about.
5,The Second Coming of Christ within you,"This book is so inspiring! In fact, to credit Yogananda even further; I have life threatening diseases and since reading this book and meditating, my symptoms are very slight! I have been able to do things that up till now have been exasperating to do! Praise the Lord, our Father in Heaven! Even my friends and family have commented how good I look and were surprised how well I was moving about!Please read this book if you need inspiration in life! There are two volumes and they are very thick, but so worth it!Jane"
5,Yes It Is True,This work is the greatest gift to humanity. It is for those who want to be with God NOW!
5,Coming of Christ,"The book is well written. It presents more sensable and acceptable interpretations of Jesus' teachings, his life and their place in our present day life. I have been meditating for 34 years and have gained a lot of this understanding thru my own experiences. It's important to have this information available to the general public, especially for those who have no clue about their lives."
5,The Second Coming of Christ,"These books are truly a blessing - the richness, depth, and beauty of them can easily be felt. There is a knowingness, a sense of Truth from the moment you open the first Volume. They are a GIFT."
4,Thundercake,Patricia Polacco did a wonderful job on this book! The illustrations were very helpful to teach the setting of a story. This was also an educational link to teach along with weather. My students loved this book and comprehended it very well because each student was very interested in the story line. I would suggest to any elementary teacher to integrate this book within their literature or science lesson in some sort of way.
4,Thundercake,I Love This Book! I read it to my Toddler daycare class and they were so into this book. It held their attention. Now when they hear thunder they want to make a thundercake.
5,good book,i love this book it is so good. i read it when i was a little kid and feel in love with it.
2,Frustrating...,"After reading this MYSELF (not to my son) it's certainly a heartwarming story. The kind you wish had HAPPENED to you...but I have 2 BIG problems with it: 1)Why CAKE!? Could it not have been Thunder BREAD, muffins or some other more healthy but fun baked good? 2)I do not want my son to think that when we're afraid, we should just go EAT to comfort ourselves. As charming as this story and the grandmother in it are, I won't ever read this to my kids."
4,Great for Grandmas,"My daughter's first grade teacher read this book to the class, and then served thunder cake (gives the recipe in the back of the book.) We had to buy the book, and now grandma is planning to read it and make it with the grandkids on a stormy day."
3,OK but not great,"The story was OK but it just couldn't have happened as the author said. The whole cake was supposed to have been baked, cooled, frosted, and cut by the time the thunderstorm hit, which was supposed to be in about an hour. Not only that, the girl and her grandmother had to collect the eggs and churn the butter to make the cake, too! No way this really happened..."
1,Not good Japanese -English transration,"I am a Japanese]English bilingual. I was searching for Japanse-Engilsh translation software for my friend to use. I tried only used Japanese-English, English-Japanese transration part of the software. I was hoping that this would do 70% of the transration correctry but I found that it did less than 10% of the transration. I could not make use out of this software."
1,Forged reviews,"The five-star reviews of this product are forged. For more examples of this, look up their other product ""Language Now"" - you will see near-identical reviews of various versions of that product, uploaded from throwaway accounts, all in June 2003."
3,Japanese language question and comments,"Contrary to the first review, the Japanese language translators are on the single CD-ROM supplied. However, you have to install two sets of files that are labeled ""J-Surf"" to get this translator on your disk. It's not intuitively obvious from the setup that this is needed. I thought they were web surfing options and skipped them at first.I would not say the translations are any better than any Web free translator I've found, but Easy Translator does offer some easy interfacing with Microsoft Word. There is a macro for Word so that all you have to do is select text in Word and click on translate."
1,Poor product. Free translators on the internet are better.,Unremarkable product. Free translators on the internet are better.
5,Amazing Stuff,I've watched Mark on TBN and seen clips of of his videos on YOUTUBE. This is a must buy for married couples. You will laugh all the way through this videos.He brings great truths to the marriage table and bed.I can't say enough about this video. Also this video could be used in a non church environment. If already pasted my copy on to help some else.
2,Laugh your way to a better marriage,"The video was ok to watch once; given a choice, I would choose to keep my money rather than spend it on this."
3,mark gunger dvd,"got the dvd's very fast. watched 2 of the 4 so far, disappointed to have scratches that caused the show to be interupted on both."
5,Laugh Your Way To A Better Marriage,Mark does a great job of talking about the differences between men and women in a very humorous way. My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed his presentation.
5,MARRIAGE FUN,Helps understand your mate in an informative yet nonthreatening way. No husband bashing! No wife bashing! Just understanding laced with humor. And it is all for a moral life-style. I loved it.
5,The Man,"I have seen this DVD many times and each time I gather more information from it. It is funny, well presented and a super way for men and women to celebrate their individuality in the company of their significant other. This DVD should be a requirement for pre-marriage couples. Bravo Mr. Gungor."
5,Excellent Truth on Marriage and funny tooooo!,"This dvd series on marriage is an excellent tool for married ppl to use! While sharing what rings true, Mark makes this a very fun captivating experience! We have watched it a number of times -- sitting with new ppl ( family and friends) each time. Wonderful! There is a strong message in here for singles that will save them heartbreaks. Well worth the cost and time to watch."
5,Great Seminar DVD for Marriage,The presentation was great and the concepts clearly presented. I beg to differ with the individual who was concerned about Mark Gungor's generalizations. Mr. Gungor stated clearly in the video that he was making generalizations and that this did not replace therapy sessions with a professional. It is amazing to think the individual even saw the DVD. It was done before a live audience. It was a weekend seminar.As far as our group who are viewing it - - They loved it. I would highly recommend it. Enough said.

3,"One Good, One Bad","Ghoulies (1985) ***1/2 (of ****)Strange film about a man (Peter Liapis) who inherits a house for his 23rd birthay. As soon as he moves in with his girlfriend, he is instantly shoved into a world of black magic, bringing to elves from the spirit world as well as a bunch of slimy monsters. Fun movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it's eerie and dark and entertaining. Rated PG-13Ghoulies 2 (1987) *1/2 (of ****)Dreadful follow-up to the original GHOULIES finds the slimeballs wreaking havoc at a carnival. Pointless, stupid and weak in all areas, what makes it right higher than 0 stars is the (very few) chuckles it gets. Not recommended. Rated PG-13"
4,Ghoulies are some pimps,I LOVE THESE LITTLE BASTARDS!reasons you should love them 2?1.The green one bites some guys ass on the toilet2.um... The green one bites some guys ass on the toilet3.They like to partythis is a good movie to wach drunk or stoned of ya rockerhillariousthats all I give this dvd a 4 out a 5
2,Dave Dayan Rocks!,This movie would suck if it wasn't for the outstanding performance by David Dayan as Eddie. He is truly underestimated as an actor and it is a shame that he hasn't done more movies.
5,Funniest B-Movie Ever!,"If you like wierd movies, check this out. People say this is one of the worst movies ever made, but it is actually very entertaining. Highly recommended for horror movie buffs."
2,Ghoulies VS Gremlins VS Critters VS Munchies VS Puppetmaster,"I can not understand what people see in Ghoulies 1 or 2?The first one I found to be a complete snore fest, if the creatures themselves wernt in it I think you'd have the same movie. It seemed to be a movie with some odd demonic creatures not doing anything much.The second one I could not get into at all, I think it was attempting to be funny, but it failed. It was completly stupid. From watchign it, I guess MGM figured if they tried to sell part 2 on it's own then it would never make any money, but by putting one and two on the same disc then there forced to buy it if they buy the first one.Why wasnt part 3 included? Part 3 is released on DVD here in regioun 4 land, released by Magna. That was the best one, tho it wasnt much of a horror flick, it was funny as hell. Somehow the creatures can talk and are smart alec comedians running muck in a college university campus. MGM shouldve included all 3 films on the same disc."
5,eating it now,"I eat 2 of these a week, and they are awesome, I'm snacking on them now. Try this with a black truffle cheese and you'll be in heaven."
2,poor quality,horrible taste and texture. worst I have ever tasted and I have tried a very wide variety of chorizo's.do not order.
3,Do not buy,"This is not a picture book on Oregon but a book of pictures of some of the few ""weird"" people of Oregon. I excepted pitures of the beautiful landscapes, mountains, rivers, and oceans of Oregon. Instead I got picture of the homeless. Save your money."
4,Uniden GMRS-380,Very nice size. Uses AAA batteries (small) so batteries won't last as long as AA. The volume/on-off control rotates the wrong way. Doesn't have the volume of the Motorola FRS/GMRS radios so hard to hear in noisy places. Very positive tactile feel on transmit button so good with gloves. Battery charge contacts on outside of case so can be used with drop-in charger. Controls very intuitive and logical. Does not have compass or stopwatch so no confusing menus. Display has large digits but no backlight. Nice small size.
2,GMRS 380-2 by Uniden,"I purchased this product because it was the best deal for what was advertised on the package. I returned this product for not coming close to matching what was advertised on its package. ""Up to a 5 mile range"" was what was promised, however, transmissions were unintelligible after 3/4 of a mile and stopped completely after only 1 mile. I could also hardly make sense out of what was being said to me over the radio during transmissions. This model performed worse than other types that I had tried that only had a 2-mile range. ... I had planned to keep them and just use them at the fair, mall, beach,etc... but crowds of people REALLY slaughtered the range on these puppies. ... In all fairness they weren't a total hunk of trash, but save your money and go for a better model or manufacturer all together."
1,Who Are We?,"While the premise is intriging, the final result and manner in which she presents her arguments is dry, boring, and difficult to understand."
1,The Real Reason,"If you slept with him on the first date, the reason he didn't call you back is because you were bad in bed, not because he was only looking to 'get some.' If you didn't sleep with him on the first date, it may have been the perfect date for you, but it wasn't the perfect date for him. But chances are the real reason he didn't call you back is because he doesn't like you. Get over it."
3,a lot of editing,"while my wife was watching the show she noticed there is a substantial amount of editing in these dvds, you'd be better off watching them on tv, some very key parts are left out."
2,cuidado con el angel,"This novela, cuts out too many of the episodes, its very choppy.Sometimes it doesn't even make sense,if it weren't for me actually watching the soap, I would have never really understood what was going on."
1,ahh it was ok. Thats all.,"it was....... Ok. Most of the important parts of the show wqs skipped. Thid was a brief run of the series, not the whole series. I was not happy with this. It was a waste of my money. There was sooooo much missing. Even the wedding was cut short. It stunk."
3,Guidado con el Angel,I realy like william levy but this video it's not worth it to buy it they cut a lots from it I cannot understand the story much why they sale it like that it's rip off so please who ever sale it shame on them we pay our money to enjoy it not to get nervouse we cant understand and I dont speak spanish that's why I got it in subtitle in English my neighbor told me the story is beautiful if I watch it in spanish but I hope I can understand so please dont do that to us because I bought 5 dvd even the fuego en la sangre same I dont enjoy it so please stop doing that or you loose business thank you
4,Great Movie But DVD is a Disappointment,"I was so excited when this movie finally arrived in my mailbox. I watched it on tv when it aired but since I don't speak spanish I could only guess what the actors were talking about. So when I found out the DVD was coming out with english subtitles I jumped at ordering this item. Though I will forever love this movie because it is so sweet and romantic, the DVD is a disappointment. So many scenes were cut out that you miss the whole plot of the story."
1,Thirty minutes extra. Not exactly a bargain.,"Caveat: The current version is also 3 DVDs at 700 minutes. This Mexican edition box set is 733 minutes, give or take. That's only an extra half hour of a series that ran for nine months, yet was carved to 12 hours for DVD. It doesn't sound like much of a bargain. I'm curious to see what buyers have to say about it."
5,So good!,"The soap opera is pretty awesome, it has a history that you can watch with the whole family on most of the scenes."
3,could have been better,The stories jumped around too much- seems like a lot of parts were missing- I was really disappointed on how much parts were missing.
2,Not good,"It was edited, different to the real soap opera.I rather watch it in tv so I can see the complete program"
3,Missing a lot of parts!!!,"This novela was good, but on the dvd it has a lot of missing important parts to it that leaves you wondering what just happened?!."
2,Disappointed,Esto fue una pérdida de dinero. Vi la telenovela en la televisión y me gustó tanto que decidí comprar el DVD. Cuando vi el DVD estaba tan decepcionado. Tantas partes fueron cortadas. Casi todas las buenas escenas interrumpía en los DVD. Si te has visto en la televisión ya no compro el DVD porque de lo contrario va a ser muy confuso. La historia completa de la especie perdido su significado.
3,Not Fair....,DVD is ok and nice setting but so many parts series is been cut especially those juicy one not fair that is all Thank you.....
2,Glad but sad,"I love Cuidado Con El Angel, I was excited to be able to purchase it. But when I received it, over 50% was not included. I hadn't seen it from the beginning, so I thought I would when I got it. But my sister did see it from the beginning and there was alot cut out. It was very disappointing, and I hope the WHOLE SEASON WILL ONE DAY BE AVAILABLE. yoyo55343 : ("
3,good novela but long awaited dvd a disappointment,"I agree with the previous reviewers that this DVD should be re-done. Though it was a good novela, some cool parts were edited out of the DVD. I understand that the editors wanted to edit out filler and redundant scenes, and scenes by secondary characters--like the parts with Ana Julia--and just focus on Marichuy and Juan Miguel's story.But parts where Marichuy wore fabulous outfits were cut out....like her trip to the Art Gallery with Leopardo, and Marichuy at Rocio's wedding. Baby Juanito's baptism was cut out too.Anyway, I'm glad I at least have a copy of this novela, but why couldn't it have been a COMPLETE BOX-SET(s) like most tv series on DVD??"
2,Very romantic,The movie itself was great but very disappointed on the DVD. They cut off a lot of the parts in the movie out and was not happy about it because it didn't make sense in some parts. They should of made it four disc instead of three and maybe they could of fit the movie in it.
2,Cut to pieces,"I was really impressed by the quality of the videos, but this novela was cut to shreds! All of the best parts, the ones that were the most real, were cut out. These scenes were the whole reason why the novela was so incredibly popular. Shame on whomever is responsible for the editing."
3,Need a Perroni / Levy fix? Here it is!,"First off, it is important to keep in mind that this telenovela was 195 episodes long in prime time, whereas the DVD version has been condensed to 12 hours. As a result, the much-shortened DVD version moves at warp speed, and much of the nuance gets lost. How can it be otherwise? In an hour you will watch what took two weeks or more to play out in prime time. So, for instance, ""Oh honey, I've waited so long for you"" often feels more like ""Oh honey, I waited six minutes for you"" on the at-home DVD version :) If you really want the full plot details, and to get engaged with all the character roles, this DVD telenovela is not for you. But if you simply want to watch a classic TN love story play out, and get a dose of Maite Perroni and William Levy in the bargain, this will get the job done. It's not the greatest telenovela by a long shot, but 12 hours of Perroni & Levy at a nice price makes it worthwhile imho. I recommend it."
4,Satifised Customer,"As usual, I recieved my item in record time and great condition. A lot of people are complaining about this soap being edited, I for one have no problems with that. Yes, some details are missing, but the story was easy to follow and all of the necessary parts are there. I personally loved that I didn't have to sit through all of the filler to get to the good stuff. So, if you're new to telenovelas and/or you've never seen this one before in it's, I highly reccommend this product. As for the soap itself, it was great. The story is fun, charming, and heart warming. Maite does as excellent job and William Levy is more than just eye candy (very very hot eye candy). His acting is superb!"
5,Excelente!,"If you didn't get the chance to view this novela when it aired on Univision, you really missed out on one of the greatest novelas to have been produced in recent times. However this DVD, though edited, is a great summary of novela. It was wonderful to once again view the love story of Marichuy and Juan Miguel. Of course there are missing scenes as this DVD mainly focuses on the story of the main characters, but personally I don't care to relive the unimportant stories. I can honestly tell you I don't think it wasn't edited haphazardly. If you've never seen it before, it's easy to follow along. Some scenes of the novela I actually forgot about, so it was refreshing nontheless to see it once again. There are English subtitles, so if you don't speak Spanish, don't worry, you too can enjoy the novela. Please buy it, you won't regret it! Ahora, me pinto de colores!"
5,A must for Bach cello suite fans,"To those of you who are chary of ""historically informed"" interpretations, you needn't be in this case. Though presumably Bylsma's approach is scholarly and ""correct"", there is nothing objective about his interpretation. It is sinewy, chocolately, dramatic, as winning and hearfelt an interpretation as any of the great performances on the modern cello by Cassals, Fournier, Rostropovich et al.Bylsma uses an actual period cello, not a reproduction, but manages to bring it alive and to coax out of it the sweetest sounds. Bylsma's tempi are faster than those familiar with modern interpretations might be prepared for, but his musicianship is so keen that the most precise phrasing remains intact and Bach's music never ends up sounding forced or rushed.Do your best to judge from the samples above, but I urge you to take a risk with this."
3,book is fine but was expecting better condition,"I think the description of the book was either ""like new"" or ""very good"" but it only deserved a ""good"""
5,So you want to learn how to give a REALLY great massage?!,"I recently purchased this book along with 2 video tapes (which I HIGHLY recommend doing...)You are guided so thoroughly through this book - you can't help but learn some great techniques.The illustrations are large and easy to follow.A Getting Started Guide along with an Ancient Wisdom and Benefits is included.[Please know that there is a ""Note to the Reader"" included that states that the book is written specifically for massage therapist and other health professionals. Prior professional massage training is required and this is not intended for the layperson.]These techniques are easily adaptable to existing hot stone treatments and can help offer your clients not only a new exciting treatment - but also receive a gentle, stress-relieving massage.I highly recommend it!"
4,"Best reference book, but not a ""how to"" learning tool","I love O'Reilly books when I know a language and need a desktop reference. I have owned the JavaScript Definitive Resource and the PERL ""Camel"" book for many years.However, if you are just starting out with Cold Fusion programming, get ColdFusion MX Bible or ColdFusion Programming instead. But remember to come back for this book when you are ready for having a good reference book."
5,Great Book,"Hello All. I purchased this book because I needed to learn coldfusion mx and the reviews said this was the book to purchase. And it is the book to purchase, it has completely everything there is to know about coldfusion. If you are going to buy one book one the subject, let it be this one. And not to mention, the support on the book is great also. Good work Rob!"
5,Still the Best reference!,"While it seems only adobe makes coldfusion books of any quality anymore this is still the reference book to get. this book combined with the adobe livedocs and you should have no problems easily finding most of your coldfusion programming answers.though you can buy the latest Web Application Constuction kits, the are good, but honestly much of them are the same book only updated, so once you have one you really have them all, plus the latest books are half online anyway so your better off with the older ones, like mx7.however for a solid reference you just can't beat orielly..if only we could get them to release another coldfusion book..."
2,"Nice organ, performance lacks precision","This is a disappointing recording for a few reasons. Kristiaan Senhave has a beautiful concept of these works, and the registrations are well chosen. But the recording emphasizes the lowest registers to the detriment of the clarity of the rest of the instrument. Perhaps this is the character of the organ and the church acoustics, but more careful microphone selection and placement might have ameliorated the problem.If you are wanting to hear a great performance of the famous Toccata movement, look elsewhere. The performance is, to put it bluntly, very uneven in tempo and rather poor in execution."
3,CAUTION: COOL CUTS BUT HORRIBLE MIXING,"The MC Mastercuts series as a whole is excellent, so it pains me to write this. Please be careful here. The track selection is very good -- lots of variety and fresh styles. BUT, the track lengths are unnecessarily short and the mixing is HORRIBLE!! If you're into the ""art"" of mixing, stay clear of this one. Sorry."
3,Why use Omnimark for examples?,"A generally well written and a very interesting read except as another reviewer mentioned, for some annoying and inexplicable reason Microsoft Press, which I have found to generally be excellent, allowed the author to give example code in the Omnimark language. You've never hear of Omnimark? Nope, neither had I or most other people. All the examples in the book should have been given in a widely used language, the most obvious language being the platform neutral language of the web, PERL. The Omnimark tutorial in the Appendix wastes 80 pages that could have been ut to better use describing BizTalk. Given the importance of Biztalk to the Microsoft strategy, it's incomprehensible how they let this one through. That's the last time I buy a Microsoft Press book on spec."
1,Disappointing - Not really a book about biztalk.,"Being new to XML, I learned quite a bit about xml and xsl from this book. Biztalk is basically an xml/xsl processing rule engine, so this background information was useful and appropriate. Once I finished the XML background chapters, the book rapidly spiralled downward. Most of the examples are actually web programming examples using this unpopular scripting language called 'Omnimark'. The section on Biztalk had very very little information in it. 'Professional Biztalk', though a little deep, is a much better book. This book should have been titled 'XML and Omnimark Programming with almost NO Biztalk'."
2,Slightly misleading title.,"Be warned, there are fewer than twenty pages of information specifically related to the Microsoft product ""BizTalk Server"".To be fair, there are two different BizTalks; the B2B specification and Microsoft's enterprise level BizTalk server. It is entirely possible to roll your own BizTalk Server, as the authors explains very well, and not need to use Microsoft's server. I was looking for information on the former.The author does offer a good high level explanation of XML, Soap and the BizTalk specification. He has a good example of how to build your own BizTalk server with VB and ASP. He also demonstrates how to use some third party tool to work cross-platform.I was attempting to find information that would help me implement Microsoft's BizTalk Server. I figured that buying a Microsoft Press book about Biztalk Servers would do the trick, it didn't. Silly me."
1,This book has almost nothing to do with Biztalk,I could not find useful information in this book. It is not good neither for beginners nor for advanced users.
5,Astounding and Extraordinary,"An amazing, landmark effort. The footnotes alone will inform any reader of the depth and wealth to be found in Dylan's work. This is essential to understand not only Bob Dylan but American music in general. Roots Galore...a deep, profound piece of research and literature."
5,times change Dylan stays the same,"How could anyone if they are honest say anything nagetive about a book about Dylan. Christ he just got a pulitizer dosen't that say it all. Even if I was not a fan, Even if I had never heard of Dylan,{ if that was possible}I would have to say that the book is well worth the time and money spent."
3,Long-Winded and Heavy on the Religion,"Here is an example of why this book is 900 pages long: ""Verse two begins with this compelling, audacious, witty, idiosyncratic, fresh, imaginative and playful line....""Similarly, to make the not very interesting point that one of Bob's songs uses the same meter as some Blake poems, Gray quotes 4 separate passages from that poetry, taking up almost a page to do what should have been done in a few lines.There are thoughtful observations in this book, but a better writer could have conveyed them all in half the space.Also, Gray makes constant reference to the Bible, something which will gall the many listeners who hate religion-based interpretations of Bob's work."
2,"Useful, but far better books are available","I became certified at the ""Practioner"" level of NLP in the late 90s and wondered what sort of introductory materials were out there today. This book provides the beginning of an introduction to NLP at best. From reading it you will learn primarily whether you have an interest in pursuing further study of NLP, but no more. It certainly does not prepare the reader to use the techniques of NLP. It's organization also is somewhat chaotic. Far better isIntroducing NLP: Psychological Skills for Understanding and Influencing People (Neuro-Linguistic Programming)"
2,annoying writting,The author relies on constant example stories to try to dumb down the subject. Numerous mentions of what will be covered later is certain to distract you until you forget where the irrelevant stories were taking you. My head is still spinning.
1,Appropriate Title- this book will indeed make you a,"I purchased this book, and within reading the first 130 pages, I returned it. This is a general mishmash of some key NLP information, combined with pointless ""inspirational"" anecdotes that don't show how to apply the techniques (which even the authors recommend that a reader could skip and not miss a beat).Now, I am no ""expert"" on NLP (not yet at least!) but I understood enough to have instinctively felt that something was wrong and that I was wasting my time. So I went to the Honest Abe Website quoted above and learned my instincts were correct. [...]This excerpt was purposefully taken out of context, because in the following lines, indeed the entire review, this book gets intensely criticized for its poor research and actual errors. I want to thank Mr. Bradbury for a well researched and precise review which saved my time, effort, and brain from a poor book."
2,"Very Basic - Not a lot of ""How to.""",Good basic overview - kinda bland. Too expensive for the material within.
1,yuck,"This book was pretty well a waste of time. There is some information that's useful, but not enough to justify reading it. As stated in a previous review, the book is horribly laid out, and covers a number of things that aren't really NLP related."
3,"A good story, but with shortcommings","The book has an interesting combination of elements and facts. Unfortunately, it is so over-loaded with strictly british slang and coloqualisms that it can be almost undecipherable to the average American reader. There needs to be an american edition of this book, and the author needs to realize that England/Britain is not all there is to the english-speaking reading world. He must be aware that there is a larger audience out there."
3,Acceptable B-Grade Thriller,"I had high hopes when I initially picked this novel up, and sadly it did not live up to my expectations. While the premise was encouraging, I thought Asher could have been a little more imaginative with the key plot point. I cannot reveal it here as I hate spoilers in reviews, but it won't take a casual reader too long to figure it out.Things ancient Egyptian always fascinate, and it was with this in mind that I bought this book. The hero of the story, Omar Ross, is an archaeologist on the fringes of acceptable theory, and decides to dig into the death (no pun intended) of one of his former colleagues in Cairo. What follows is a twisting plot of intrigue and double-cross. With good action sequences and wonderful descriptions of desert survival, this thriller is diverting, but do not expect too much of it. It was a great read B-grade read that I enjoyed without having my socks blasted off."
3,You get what you pay for,This is an alright seat for $30. I'm not cheap I would pay $100 for a very nice one. I really could'nt find one. Easy to install. I'm not sorry I purchased it.
5,Great Customer Support,"I have a 5 year old Speed Cart that is a pleasure to use. Recently I had a problem with the brake lever & cable. I called Sun Mountain to order parts. They sent the necessary parts at no charge. What a unique experience for a company to stand behind their product, even after warranty has expired. Way to go, Sun Mountain!"
3,Easy to install BUT,My husband easily installed this seat. I've sat on it a couple of times when I needed to rest but find it a little flimsy. Don't think it will last too long.
3,Sun Mountain Speed Cart V1 cart seat,The seat is unstable and looks weak. I have to say it does the job
3,Heavy for Flip Flops,"I am used to Crocs flip flops so found these a bit heavy. They are supposed to be good for your legs and feet, so I guess I'll give them another try."
5,Can't find them anywhere to purchase,"I bought a pair of these sandals in 2007. I totally love them. I have tried this last year to buy a new pair and can't find them anywhere. Please keep selling them, there the best thing that happen for my feet. I have very painful feet and they have given me relief. Is there a size 8 womens anywhere?????"
4,Comfortable,"This sandal is very comfortable and cute. The velcro tabs allow adjustments which is very nice. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because they are a bit heavy, which is a drag after a long day wearing them."
4,tomahawk and thumber players only,disc is awesome if your a tomahawk or thumber player. tried backhand and forehand and the disc is horrible. i throw alot of tomahawk and if thrown hard enough and tuned properly you can get 400ft easy. i am a pitcher and i can get this thing going 500ft. it will flip 1 or 2 time and then glide down. remember if you dont throw over hand often you need to start off slow or you will hurt your arm. ive seen many baseball shoulder injuries and throwing this disc is no different.
5,Sumptuously written and Humorous at the same time,"As I read this book my emotions went up and down along with Ellen, the protagonist. I would be laughing hysterically at the childrens antics and crying when Ellen makes personal discoveries about herself and her grandmother. I could almost feel the seering heat of the steambath."
5,"beautiful, deep, and transcendant","I loved this book so much that I bought 2 copies to give to very dear friends who had lived in Japan. I read Namako on a ferry and the motion of the waves seemed to merge with the pulse of the narrative. This book is very beautifully written. There's a lot already written about girls on the cusp of adolescence but rare is a writer who handles her topic with such grace and depth. I loved the Japanese setting, the archetypal grandmother who kept challenging the young heroine, telling her she had no soul until finally the girl finds her soul and her path. It explores a lot of the dark nooks and crannies. It is never patronizing. Oddly, because of the Japanese setting, it feels like a fairy tale that could have happened anywhere, in any setting. I loved the final epiphany at the ending. I think this book is also a nice feminist alternative to all the Holden Caulfieldesque boy-centered books people of my generation were expected to read when we were teens."
4,A warm coming of age story in a disparate clash of culture,"Linda takes a new slant on the standard coming of age story. She weaves a nicely textured narration of a young girl's trials through adolescense, with the added twist of cultural shock as seen through a childs eyes. The novel flows smoothly, complete but as in all good storys, leaving the reader wanting more. A delightful work; sparkle, innocence, heartfelt. A throughly enjoyable novel for the child in all of us."
2,Big Pills Don't Fit,"This splitter would probably work fine if you are halving medicine doses of a small size. I bought it to split Triple Stength Osteo Bi Flex (horsepills!) and big Centrum vitamins to make them easier to swallow, but unfortunately, they are too large for this splitter. The top will not close all the way when splitting these huge pills, and they must be force jammed in to the holding area to be cut at all. The result is an unevenly cut pill, which is no big deal since I'm not concerned about perfectly halving them like I would be if I were halving prescription meds. Still, I'm disappointed. They should say it's not for large pills--I wouldn't have bought it!"
5,Nice construction,"Pill holding cradle is a nice slightly tacky compound to keep the pill from popping out from under the blade. Razor sharp blade is well mounted and secure. Easy, quick, clean cuts. Polycarbonate housing is tough. A good buy!"
1,Defective,This broke the first time I used it. The product came with the razor to split pills off center. I've used a cheaper pill splitter for months without fail.
1,Garbage,"It did not split them in half, would crush part generally as it cut in 3/5 and 2/5. Pathetic. I do not recommend."
5,Works fine,"It's a typical splitter so far...I use it on rare occasion but it has a simply v-shape valley to center the pill, the blade seems typical, and it has the little catch basin. No real issues."
4,Great for odd shapes,"This is the second pill cutter I've owned, and I recommend it specifically for odd shaped pills. The orange rubberized base is sticky and helps hold the pills precisely so you can get a good clean cut on odd shaped medicines. I give 4 stars only because the lid opening action is quite stiff, but this little unit otherwise performs quite well."
1,Poor quality; sloppy cutting,This splitter is one of the worst I've used. I threw it away after trying it on about 1 week's worth of pills.If you really need a pill split evenly in half.... don't use this crap.It's really hard to find a quality pill cutter.The entire point of the product is to evenly split the pill in HALF.Unfortunately most splitters sort of randomly crack your pill in two pieces.I was excited to buy this product because it's made in the USA.Unfortunately this thing is as bad as or worse than all the Made-in-China crap I've tried.
3,Not much better than my hands,"Product is average. I have 20 mg pills that I cut 4 ways. I used to just break in 2 with my hands but it was a little harder to break the half in half when I started breaking them in four. So I thought the pill splitter would do the trick but it was just slightly better than my hands.Its to hard to get the pill to be centered perfectly and also when you move your hand away and close it down to cut, the pill always moves.My overall recommendation- Save your money and split with your hands if possible or box cutter or knife at your house. You will get the same results"
1,hope you don't need support from hp,HP support should be called non-support. I have bought a lot of HP products in the past but have always been lucky enough to have them all hold up through the warranty period until now. Bought a Pavilion Media Center PC with lightscribe and less than 5 months later the lightscribe dvd died. Do they get me a replacement or just a run around? You got it....the run around. I will never and I advise everyone else not to buy from HP until they can prove to stand by their warranties.
4,Excellent Expandability,"Perhaps I love this computer because I have upgraded it so much, but as I recall, it was pretty fast out of the box. It runs XP by default without any issues, but I upgraded to the 64-bit Vista Home Premium, 3GB of RAM and upgraded the video to an ATI Radeon X1050. With the additions, this computer went from fast to a real workhorse. It's not a Mac Pro obviously, but it is more than sufficient for any consumer's needs."
2,"Mediocre, neither great nor awful","The book was interesting and enlightening about some of the Gangrel's practices, but for the most part there seemed to be something lacking from the overall atmosphere to the book. It wasn't great or terrible, but I really think that White Wolf didn't quite know what kind of info they wanted to publish in these books when they made this."
4,Post-modern psychology at its best.,"With deceptively simple metaphors and graceful prose, James Hillman calls each of us to examine and transform the moral foundation of our lives. He writes of ""growing down"" so that character and personality blossom in a way that benefits all-the individual as well as society. ""Soul's Code.."" can be read as a ""how-to"" roadmap for personal growth, but also as an elegant and eloquent plea for a thoughtfully moral society. An inspiring read; one of those books that my mind returns to at unexpected moments"
4,good vibrations,"good and possitive vibrations is what you get after reading this book. I like the whole reasoning that it gives for ""following your bliss"". It makes you feel justified when you are doing that which you like most, in that you are really keeping in touch with your innermost layer and building the stronghold of your being. I didn't like, though, the stress on famous people. The author could have also picked an example of an ordinary but happy and successful life story."
5,One of my favorite books,"Probably Hillman's most accessible work. Truly inspirational without being preachy. It helped me have faith in my own gifts and path. Not for everyone, I'm sure. You probably need to have a somewhat intellectual, philosophical and spiritual bent to truly enjoy it."
1,"Jump on the Bandwagon, Make a Buck","His next book will, I suppose, have something about angels in its title. Or is that angles? A lot of neoplatonist claptrap, this one. Mr. Hillman should perhaps do some studying of modern cognitive science."
1,Missing the point,"I chose not to finish the book, because I lost track what the message was supposed to be. I don't understand why authors decide to fill hundreds of pages and the quintessence is missing, instead of keeping it lean and to the point. Less can be more, but maybe the conclusion was revealed after I stopped reading......"
2,Acorn This.,Way too Transpersonal for me. I had to read this for a Psyche class. I was not impressed.
1,Not as described,"The book was described as being in very good condition. Unfortunately, the cover was damaged in several places and heavily marked and scuffed, the binding was loose, and it looked like it had been half read-to-death already. More like ""bounced around multiple dorm rooms where it was used to prop up uneven desks and bedposts, then kind of sorta leafed through during boarding announcements at Atlanta airport, used as a pillow during the inevitable 12-hour delay, and eventually wound up at a library book sale in Cleveland"" condition. Not at all the way it was described."
4,"A good, easy read that will get back to you later.","Short, sweet and to the point -- you can get through this in an evening. This book has many levels from ""yeah, sure"" fluff to deep hitting insight. Hillman has a knack for saying something very deeply significant in a way that goes down easy and comes back for you to think about it later. A lot of parenting insight was also stuffed among the pages like drying flowers to be enjoyed for many years to come. I recommend this book highly to those with growing children ""at that age"" of discovering themselves"
4,It was like new,"I liked the fact that it had no markings. There was no highlighted areas, no dents, or writing in it."
4,A book for romantics (in the broadest sense),"I've just read the reviews on this book - 21 to date. And to most of them, I would politely suggest:Lighten up, folks!I found Dr. Hillman's ideas to be fascinating. Through this book he furthered my understanding of a number of issues. If you lean more toward a romantic philosophy of life, I would highly recommend this book - especially the sections on recognizing the invisibles in our lives. No witch hunt, I believe that Hillman is trying to go in a completely different direction: creating respect for those invisibles who support us without falling into the concreteness of either superstition or empirical science - both of which render the invisibles invisible."
3,Corny Old Man Gets In The Way of Good Ideas,"Hillman is unique, in that he dares to position himself inside and yet between several different fields of study. Passing over philosophy, psychology, history and biography it becomes evident that he probably should have focused on his strength: psychology. He does offer a genuine and even touching critique of the field and produces a new (actually very old)path of development for thoughts about the self. Hillman's cornyness, however, is unrestrained in this book. You will often feel yourself shudder at the management-book quality crap and the 'I sort of understand this' name dropping. Nonetheless Hillman directs attention to character and uniqueness, and gives individuals plenty to think about. If you are into a little soul-searching and can handle a grandpa like humdrum, this may be the book you're looking for. Otherwise, Hillman's Kinds of Power is the better book (especially since it is unabashadly of management-book quality)."
4,Nice dress watch with useful stopwatch functions.,"The brief description on the website does not point out that one of the smaller dials is actually the sweep second hand. The large center hand is really the stopwatch, set in motion with one of the buttons, and accumulating by 1/20 sec on the upper small dial to 12 hours on the lower small dial. I found that it was difficult to read the stopwatch total minutes accurately on the small dial but found improvement with practice. Overall, the watch presents a fashionable appearance, the luminous dials for the watch function can be read at night, the tachymeter dial engraving is small but easily readable, and the watch has real utility beyond just telling the time of day accurately."
5,Wonderwand,Great for cleaning under refrigerator. Would have liked an even thinner attachment piece but still works great as is. Gets the majority of dust from under the refrigerator.
4,good versatility for the price,"I kind of knew that it wouldn't be ""the perfect extension"", but I will say that is pretty good for vacuum under couches and stuff. it didn't fit under my refrigerator, but it fitted under my stove, my couch and some of my crevices around my house. the seller should that a picture of the tip of the extension for further sales. it is actually better than I expected. the extension works flat on the floor, so u can actually go over the dirt. the ""one size fit almost all didn't fit my Dirt Devil, but I sanded it down with a dremmel and if fits now but again, the seller specifyied that on the page, so is nothing I wasn't prepared for. maybe is safe to say (starting on the premisse that all Dirt Devil have the same size apperture on the hose) that Dirt Devil is one of the brands that it will not fit without some adjustments.Overall I liked the product."
1,Not worth the money,"The first moment I tried to use this gadget I already got annoyed with it. It might look interesting and promises a lot, but the flimsy design makes it very difficult to do exactly what it was suppose to do. If I would have had not trown out the original box , I surely would have returned it."
1,Terrible product,"What a piece of junk. I bought it to clean out the lint trap in my dryer. The suction isn't on the end, it's on the side, which might work for some things, but definitely not for the purpose that I need it for. And I have a it's so long and weirdly shaped, it doesn't stay on my hose attachment, which is on a Eureka vacuum. Waste of money."
1,Disappointment,"I have Japanese brand circular polarizer filter for my previous owned lense and purchased this filter for my new lense. It was a great disappointment for me and I believe this filter is not worth its price.I have Canon 7D camera and my new lens is Canon 85 mm f 1.8 LensIt creates blue tint all over the photo which is annoying and disapponting.When I take out the filter or I apply Japanese filter there is no blue tint.This filter is ruining my photoes and I have finally decided not to use the filter at all. I am much happier with the result (without with this filter)Now I will purcase the same Japanese brand for my new lens as well.You can compare and see the blue tint from the RGB Histogram of camera, any photo taken via this filter has to pass software colour correction.Unfortunately I am overseas customer which I can not return this product and have to throw it in to waste bin."
1,Kindle Missing Lesson Steps 100 Lessons in Classical Ballet: The Eight-Year Program of Leningrad's Vaganova Choreographic School,"Unfortunately in Chapter 6 the Lessons go from 1,2 directly to 7...so 3,4,5,6 lesson steps are missing. Not sure if other chapters have the same problem as when I bought the Kindle version I was just starting Chapter 6 using the book.To be fair I will create another post to rate the book itself as a 5star, but I do hope this low rating will get the attention of the Kindle version to be corrected.Dance like nobodies watching..."
3,"Combinations, but no reasons or corrections","I am an intermediate classical ballet student. I was disappointed in this book because it wasn't as I expected. It listed the steps and combinations taught in each level, but it didn't explain why. I returned it, but it might be useful for a teacher who is developing a syllabus."
2,Description does not match picture!,"Please notice anyone looking at this item: the picture and title are for the backpack,but the description is for the ""Getta Tote"". My wife wanted the backpack and they sent me the tote. Make sure you are getting the right item."
4,Very happy customer!,"I was very pleased with my purchase and I received it in a timely manner. The only complaint I have, is that I think the shade is too short for the lamp. However (for $5.99 at a discount lamp store) I was able to replace the shade with a wider and taller one. I love Waterford crystal, and my new lamp is no exception."
4,at least 3 good songs,"She does very good performances of ""Kookaburra lives in the old country"" and ""Inch by inch, row by row"". My 2-year old has memorized Kookaburra. ""It's a very good day for ..."" is also good. I haven't heard Kookaburra recorded anywhere else. Peter Paul & Mary did Inch by Inch too, but I like this rendition better than PP&M's. The other songs we mostly skip over, but 3 good songs is pretty good for any CD."
4,An unknown gem.,"I had never heard of this movie before, and I wasn't really expecting a great deal. I was pleasantly surprised, as war movies go, this is surprisingly good. I wish there would have been more said about the Winter War to explain why the Finns were fighting with the Axis against Russia, but that doesn't detract from the quality of the movie."
5,ALSOU Rules,"Alsou is a very talented and beautiful singer from Russia, she has a great voice and her song Before You Love Me is the BEST. Perhaps her music can be compared to Britney's but she sings so much better than her (sorry Brit, luv ya but you can't sing!). I saw her on television at the World Music Awards and loved her performance. If you like pop or just music, buy this CD and you won't be disappointed. GO ALSOU!"
2,What the world needs now is another....,"Does the world need yet another over hyped euro pop star?Probably not. That won't stop Alsou or her fathers billions from trying to make it happen, though.Pretty weak offering, though. There is much better pop you can find without looking hard."
3,It's a bracelet. Made of copper.,"I bought this just as a copper bracelet. I couldn't care less, or believe less, in the ""healing properties"", and hence won't be reviewing them.I have tiny wrists, and even after overlapping the ends this bracelet is too large. When I adjusted it, the bracelet didn't bend uniformly (though I was fairly careful) and therefore is misshapen: hence the docking to 3 stars. The size (and resulting bending) wouldn't be a problem for larger-wristed folk, but they can write their own reviews. It's a perfectly fine copper band. Nothing fancy, a nice thickness, and a fine sheen (without being gaudily shiny). It also didn't discolor my wrists, which is nice. It seems a bit expensive for just a plain copper band, but all the other copper bands I looked at were more expensive."
4,Made in the USA,Made in the USA was stamped into the inside of the bracelets that made it all worth it. Thank you
2,Pretty bracelet,"It is a very pretty bracelet, but I did not notice any difference in my arthritis pain. I wore it for about a month, night and day. In the end, I took it off because it did not seem to make any difference for my arthritis. It was a disappointment, as I was really hoping it would work."
3,copper bracelet,"The quality of the bracelet is great, it looks nice, I didn't notice any improvements but what did bother me was the ""green"" stain on my wrist."
4,Nice Copper Bracelet,"It is a nice sturdy bracelet with no protective coating. This allows any benefits for joint pain to be absorbed from the bracelet through the skin. Does it work? Sometimes I think it helps, but I'm not sure. It's probably a lot like chicken soup -- it can't hurt."
1,"Well Built, but al Little TOO Well Built!!","This ladder is indestructible! Way too indestructible, actually. It's just way too heavy to handle. At over 50 lbs, it's just way too awkward. I lent it to my neighbor so he could clean his gutters. The two of us, who are both able-bodied men, could not handle it! Get a smaller one or one of their newer, lighter weight models"
3,Cute shoes,"The shoes are adorable, but unfortunately didn't fit my feet. They were a little tight in the toes. So disappointed."
5,Super comfortable.........,"So many flats aren't very comfy, but these sure are. I've had a tonne of compliments. These definitely fit true to size."
2,cute but painful,"They are awfully cute shoes, but I was in so much pain from trying to wear them that I had to return them. I found them to be a little long for the size also."
5,These are really comfortable,I love these shoes. Very comfy. Just got them and wore them the first time today. They fit well and are well padded for extra comfort.
1,Typical Iomega--Lousy!,"This drive crashed and burned after a year just as my Iomega 100MB External Zip drive had before it. I should have learned my lesson the first time, but I gave Iomega a second chance. Bad idea! I'm through with Iomega for good. The company makes sleek-looking products that are not reliable, and their support is virtually non-existent."
2,overall bad design,"The HD unit is compact, and works well. If you have a Mac, reformat it for Mac files, and its speed will greatly improve. Pretty blue LED light. Price was reasonable.Problems:1) There is no On/Off switch - you have to unplug it.2) The power supply cord attaches to the unit with a difficult to align pin plug, rather than a standard power plug.3) The power supply unit is big and bulky, so even though the HD is compact, the entire system (HD + powersupply + cords) is not all that portable.There are better HDs out there."
1,Piece of junk...if I could sue I would,"Yes, it's a good price, yes it's by a good brand company. Well I've had mine for less than a week now, and spend about 4 or 5 days transferring everything I've collected in the last 10 years or so to the hard drive off CD's. It worked fine for the 5 days, great really. Then a loud repetitive grinding noise, and POOF, it's all gone. Now I'll have to head to the dumpster, dig through the trash of mine and my 100 or so neighbors looking for the CD's containing the last 10 years of my folders and files..."
2,Want to repel rodents? Buy this drive!,"Just bought one of these. Seems to work okay, but the high pitch, whirring noise of the fan may be of some concern for some users. It produces 50-55 decibels (equivalent to noise emanating from a 30-year old refrigerator). I'll be using it for backup only, so I'll be able to turn it off when not in use. Which, BTW, must be performed by unplugging it since there is no power switch. If you're in need of disk capacity, spend the extra $100 to get yourself into a firewire compatible drive--the transfer rate of USB 2.0 isn't adequate for quick access."
2,Not what I expected,"To Whom It May Concern;I expected a product that was 'cutting dege' technology and well it might be. The original information that I loaded went in like lightening (Firewire - I guess). I was warned by everyone not to get something slow. Well that part turned out good. But the 80Gigs filled up in 1 month. I use a 40 Gig hard drive. It turned out to be a mistake in the setting, their settings. Now I really don't know how much I can trust the product."
1,promises 80gig and delivers 20gig,solid container but what used to be a 80gig capacity drive is suddenly 20 gig...how'd that happen? typical iomega quality. My mistake.
1,Dont waste your cash,"I have had my Iomega HD for about 7 months now and it recently crashed after contacting Iomega and then asking for an additional $25 to assist me although the product is still under warrantee is a bit rich for my blood, I would steer clear of any Iomega products from now on."
5,It did the trick. . .,"I am returning to college and wanted to place as high as possible in the required series of math classes. Bascially, I wanted to skip all the pre-algebra and beginning aglebra classes and test into College Algebra. I knew I knew this stuff, but I haven't had a math class in 20 years. So I got this book, did all the reviews and exercises from cover to cover, and, amazingly, it all came back to me. It took me about 6 weeks, a few nights a week, to get through it. I took the placement test at the college and got placed into the class I hoped for - I begin College Algebra next quarter. It would never have been possible without this book (and my hard work studying everything it offered). If you are returning to school and need an algebra refresher, this is an excellent one."
4,great review of algebra,"I havent had algebra in over 30 years and am getting certified to teach high school math. This book takes you through the review in a very thoughtful sequence. I did all the exercises in this book in just one week, completely refreshing my knowledge. HOWEVER, I was very frustrated by numerous mistakes in the solution sets. I wasted much time trying to figure out how they could have gotten their answer only to discover they were wrong (typically a typo). This book would not be good for people who are learning algebra for the first time, or did not really understand it the first time around. But it is VERY GOOD for refreshing knowledge buried deep inside your brain."
2,too many errors,"This book has a disturbing number of errors in its calculations. They may be simple typos (negative signs omitted, etc.) but they can be very confusing for someone trying to validate his/her understanding.The authors do a pretty good job of outlining and presenting the basic concepts of algebra, but skip over some important fundamentals, such as derivation of the quadratic formula."
5,Quick Algebra Review,"Another of Mr. Peter H. Selby's fine book. Communicating is an art within him which few have. Modern technology as we experience it today, reveals to many of us who are senior professionals not only how much we have fallen behind in the math sciences, but how much knowledge of the past has faded from us.It is depressing to us to realize this.Thanks in great part to Mr. Selby, we are able to review and recover so much with such ease as never before in life. He takes you through difficult concepts with such ease. His style and method turns you into an addiction on the subject.I highly recommend his books to those who ""cannot understand concepts"".Electronic calculators have turned us into non-computable brains, and we are ignorant in the knowledge of many basics. He steers us through so many ""mysteries"" in math with such pleasure and ease."
2,"Not exactly ""intermediate""","I got this book with the hope of sharpening my algebra skills, particularly with respect to getting better at manipulating equations and isolating variables. This book claimed to be intermediate, which I thought would be what I needed. I would classify this book squarely in the ""basic"" category for algebra. It covers mostly only the very basic concepts and does not go into much depth as far as how to use concepts or any complex examples.Overall, if you are very fuzzy on your math or need a supplement to an introductory algebra course, I guess the book would be ok. It isn't exceptionally clear at explaining even the basic concepts, so if you didn't know them very well to begin with i don't know how much it would help."
2,Significantlydated but possibly useful account of West Timor,"Don't be misguided by the title, this book doesn't cover all of Timor and there really isn't a ""problem"" (a political one, at least). This is really a reprint of a 1954 study of Western Timor that is well done from a geographic standpoint, but its current relevance is questionable. Although there have been few quantum advances forward in W. Timor, the book captures none of the current strife on the island of Timor."
3,Not for me.,I saw the other 5 star reviews so I ordered this. Frankly I was disappointed I found it hard to stay interested in. I don't normally skip pages in books but that's what I found myself doing in this one just to get to the end.
4,"nice bottle, no scent","I'm extremely picky when it comes to water bottles. What I like about this one: reusable c aluminum, .75 L size, and the quality seems like it will stand up. However, it is sometimes hard to drink from, the outside gets really chilly, and it's a bit hard to clean out as well, since the mouth of the bottle is small, and the sport top is different."
2,Not for sports,Bought this specifically for the covered mouth piece when not in use. Unfortunately the flip top broke off the first time it was used. I happened to have a replacement and the second one broke the next time. The bottle itself is great but the flip top was the reason I bought it and is not usable.
2,Speaker to fast...,"This DvD is alright..Nothing dramatic..the speaker plainly a fast reader..if english is not your first language, I wouldnt recomend it."
3,Kaito 4 Way Powered Emergency Radio is ok,"I would liked to have known that this radio was so small. It's only 7-1/2"" by 4"". I thought it was a big radio, but I like because you can just wind it up and you have a flashlight and sirens blazing if you need to have them and play a radio to without batteries. Shortwave you really can't get much in, I don't know if it is because the radio is small or not, but it is ok for the price. FM stations come in ok. You can use rechargeable batteries and use the sun to recharge them, this is a good item to take camping."
4,Made a great Christmas gift,"Got one for two relatives and they were both very happy with them. We live in a rural area that loses power often, so these come in quite handy!"
3,Good thing it's cheap...,"Bought this camera a while back - had fun with it a few times and then promptly forgot about it until I found it again. Love the concept, the execution is only so-so... but then again, it's a cheap novelty camera so what can you expect? The biggest tip with this camera is that it needs a LOT of light to produce a usable image. Since the color filters block some of the light, and by dividing up the frame into 4 squares you're not working with much film area... if you don't have PLENTY of light you're sunk. Took pics in full sunlight and they came out great, everything else is either dark and grainy or not even printable at all."
1,Not worth your money!,"This camera is junk. The winder is rough, the shutter button sticks... and the camera did not roll my film back up! I had to go into a dark room to take it out of the camera It would not roll back into the film canister. And it was completely out so I had to shove it back in by band, I got fed up with it and said forget it and took it in the light and it had a TON of scratches on it, so good thing I didn't develop it anyways, the pictures would have turned out like crap. Do not waste your money on this.... just digitally edit your photos to look like this. Dont waste your time or money on this."
3,Not bad for the price,"I bought the speakers for my daughter for Christmas and she was pleased with them. I only paid around $5 for them so naturally they aren't going to have outstanding sound quality. I really like the way they fold up nice and compact for easy travel. The only thing I wish they had was an internal rechargable battery. They also work with other mp3 players and I use them with my cell phone to play music. If you don't want to spend alot of money or have a kid that is rough on stuff or tends to lose stuff, then this is a great product for them."
3,mp3 player speakers,"I have to disagree with the previous reviewer. I bought a pair of these for my daughter's ipod and they sound great. I even bought another set to listen to my Vision M at work. Of course, if you're looking for the same listening experience you'd get from your home sound system or even good desktop computer speakers, you're going to be disappointed. But if all you want is something to play your music and sound decent, this works as well as many much more expensive speakers I've seen being sold. It gets pretty loud and I didn't notice any distortion.The bad thing about it is that the speaker isn't sold with the power adapter. (What's that about?) It runs for a surprisingly long time off 4 AA batteries, but you can buy an adapter at Best Buy, Circuit City or Radio Shack for less than $20. Just remember: 6V, 350mA."
3,Does the job.,"A top-of-the-line speaker system this is NOT, but it does the job.As a happy owner of a Creative Zen Vision:M, which is now discontinued, finding a docking station is pretty much futile. They had a decent one on the market but like the player itself they're no longer available.I just wanted something to use at work so I could hear some music, thanks to internet blocking I couldn't play all of my stuff through my computer speakers. Legally downloaded files require a check on the ""rights"" to that file and of course my work blocks those sites. So anything I purchased for download was off limits.I had an FM transmitter, one burned out quickly and the other eats batteries like there's no tomorrow. I just wanted to hear music, I didn't need surround sound. I didn't need CD quality. I just wanted to hear music. This little gizmo does the trick.Worth every penny."
3,Just Fine for the Price,"These speakers are just fine for what you pay for them. I did not notice any static or interference whatsoever no matter what the volume. For $13, they are a bargain. As was said before, the only thing they lack is a power cord."
4,Very detailed bio of a great physicist,"I read this book about Feynman with great interest and I found it better than Gleick's book. Some people might not like the amount of detailed info about all sorts of Feynman trivia but how can a true fan of his not be delighted with all this great stuff! The technical parts are very thorough and detailed; it was well beyond anything you find in ""popular"" books like Gleick's. In that sense this is not really for general readers but there is enough interesting stuff for the interested layman too. I highly recommend this very thoroughly researched masterpiece!"
3,Technical Tedium in a Factual Forest,"This book may be OK if you like heaps of incomprehensible equations amidst piles of insufficiently edited facts about Feynman's life. I largely agree with the ""Zero stars"" reader, although I guess the book has merit for its probable factual/theoretical completeness. Feynman's life and science were so fascinating that any book about this, even poorly written, has got to have some value!"
5,Best Frisbies ever.,I have been throwing a frisbie around one way or another for over 40 years. These frisbies are easy to throw and catch. The soft edges mean never having a blister or any other kind of finger bother. They also stand the test of time. I have had one in the trunck of my car for 10 years and the heat or the use don't seem to bother it.
5,Excellent,Great product as advertised... easy to throw and catch... the one that lights up works great
4,i know a better book,"Check out: ""goddesses don't buy green bananas"" [...] great book for a person who is scared and wants to connect to other women with cancer. large black and white photos and stories."
5,a wonderful collection,This is one of the better collections of Annie's works. There are some absolutely amazing photographs of women from all over the world... from all walks of life. A wonderful collection for any art buff.
3,Flashes of Brilliance in an Uneven Collection,"Looking through this book you can see glimpses of Annie Liebovitz's brilliance - but too often all you see are mundane shots carried out as if she were on autopilot (or working at the portrait studio at K-Mart). Of course, reading about the schedule she had taking these shots points out the grueling task it was. Perhaps she should have selected 50 women instead of 200."
4,Great Book from a Now Classical Photographer,A real treat for those who and who are not Leibovitz fans. Leibovitz is the only living photographer who has been honored with a show at the Smithsonian.
1,Tired,"This book consists partly of previously published, fawning and banal portraits of celebrities. The other pictures are uninspired, staged-looking, and unenlightening.A few of the dancer and athlete photos are compelling because of the grace and strength of their subjects, but that's about it. A pop magazine photographer just isn't equipped to handle the subject of ""Women,"" which would be ambitious even for a truly visionary artist. Susan Sontag's essay, which seems to belong to a different book, doesn't offer many insights we haven't heard before, and the book is strangely designed and sloppily edited. It seems hastily made for such a weighty tome. Please save your money."
5,Women,It is inspirational to see such an eclectic montage of women under one cover and makes me realize that we can be anything! Annie Leibovitz is phenomenal! She has a way of uncovering the soul. I'm buying one for all the important women in my life!
3,Damage to book,There were black/gray smudge markings on the inside blank page. Disappointed as this was a coffee table display purchase and it was supposed to be pristine.
2,Just a name,"Although the idea of this book is worthwhile, I am amazed to find so many of the images out of focus. She is supposed to be a fine photographer, but maybe it is this title that has allowed her to feel okay with displaying such poor examples of portraits. It seems she rushed through the work just to get the book published as I don't sense that she put too much heart into the work."
3,This holster could be better.,Starrett is usually high quality and expensive. This was moderately priced but not as high quality as one would expect with the Starrett name attached. So far it is still functional but I doubt it would stand up to hard use.
2,More durable material would be nice,"This is basically a low end holster. For the low cost, what else would you expect, but I would pay more for a more heavy duty holster. Something that would hold up to ""On The Jobsite"" use. The weakest point is that nothing covers the face with the degree marks on it. That should be covered by a flap with a buckle or a tie to keep it from getting banged up. For now I just turn mine with the face towards the back, that keeps it safe and accurate."
3,An Introduction to Macrobiotics,"An Introduction to Macrobiotics is exactly what the title says. This book is a very basic overview of how a macrobiotic follower views the world and includes brief biographies on the Japanese group of people who are responsible for the reintroduction of the macrobiotics lifestyle into the modern world. The book is very easy to read and only briefly touches on the different components of a macrobiotic lifestyle. The introduction to the Yin and Yang aspects of the world in general and food in specific was easy to grasp. Where Ms. Heidenry could have expounded was the concept that she alluded to a couple times of the centering of the diet around grains. This book would probably be a great prerequisite for Ms. Heidenry's book, Making the Transition to a Macrobiotic Diet."
3,Catch the Creative Spirit,"I found this book this year at the bargain section and was impressed by it. I never knew anything about the visionary, poet, theologian, composer, healer, and abbess, Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179).History suggests that she fell into obscurity, only to be resurrected in the closing decades of the twentieth century. She produced major works of theology, wrote on science and natural history, and frankly discussed human sexuality but is best known today for the ravishingly beautiful chants and hymns she composed.The author June Boyce-Tillman examines various aspects of Hildegard from a practical perspective. The early chapters set Hildegard in historical context. Others place her work in the context of her prayer life, her visions, her approach to healing, and her music and its centrality in her theology.It, at times, was a little hard for me to follow, but overall it was worth it. I recommend it!"
4,Waterproof but not oilproof,"These labels are perfect if you only need to protect against water. I was using them to make labels for spa products and the water was fine, but the oil smudged them."
3,"Inexpensive, Good Fit, but a Bit Noisy","The blower in my 2002 Highlander was on its way out. I had to keep smacking it with a 3-ring binder to get it to run. So, I figured it was time for a replacement. Found this unit for around $50 and figured it was worth a shot.Installation was a breeze: Just unbolt the existing unit, unplug the wires, plug them into the new unit and reattach. Might want to be sure you're using a fairly short driver just because clearance is a little tight in that area.The unit does get the air moving again, but I'm not sure it's as fast as the original blower. Also, it's a bit on the noisy side -- and it kinda has that sound that makes me think a bearing's going to be failing before too many months have passed. But I figure it's cheap enough, I'll probably just get another one when and if it does go out."
2,Steer clear: an amateur work,"As a scholar of what might be called outsiders, I was eager to read this work on tatooing. But the scholarship here is hackneyed and unprofessional. His sources are scattered and incomplete and his discussion is of similar quality. Given the excellent quality of research being done on this topic, this book falls into a dont-bother-with category."
1,Not what I hoped,"I assumed that every book about birds would have many pictures of birds. This did not. The few pictures contained lanscapes, but no birds. I wanted a book to help identify the birds in Minnesota. This is definately not it!"
2,Dissapointing,"The illustrations in this book are wonderful, but the story is confusing at best. The author uses a clumsy style of poetry that mixes rhyming verses with non-rhyming verses making it very awkward to read aloud. Also, instead of focusing on one of the many stories concerning Elijah, it tries to cram all of them into too limited a space resulting in a jumbled up mess. My last complaint is in regard to some of the wording. I prefer to teach my children from the NKJV or KJV, but in the part of the story where Elijah is fed by the black birds, the author uses the translation that Elijah is brought food by an angel. Children who are already very familiar with the story of Elijah may be able to sift through this book and make something felicitous of it, but it would probably take a child who is far outside of the target audience's age range to do such. I don't recommend this book as bedtime story because of how poorly it is written, and I most adamantly do not recommend it as a teaching tool."
4,"It's paper, and plastic","Can't say much more. Luckily I've convinced my 5 year old that after the original time which she insists on using the proper colors, it's much more fun to freestyle and put whatever color peg you want in the holes, so she is getting a slight amount of replay value out of it. The pegs are the crappy ones designed for the flatscreen and cube, and the paper is see through, so I'mma just order some origami paper, since it's about the same thickness and I can get it precut.The box arrived, it's just taped on the sides, and we only had 43 pegs, not the original 50, and there was loose pegs in the box, which is what prompted me to count them and find that we were missing 7. No biggie, but I won't be purchasing anything other than pegs in the future.Definitely not the toy I remember growing up."
5,Great for My Little Pony Lovers,This peg set is great for any child who loves My Little Pony. You get some sheets and pegs with this but it never hurts to have some moreLite Brite All Peg Refillaround the house just in case you run out of the color you want.
2,No where near enough pegs.,"First and foremost, the seller sent item quickly and efficiently. No issues there. But there are no where near enough pegs. Even with an existing pegs from the original toy there aren't enough pink and violets. I don't get how they can put out a product that require SO MANY of specific colors and not provide them with the refill set. Going on to search ebay for peg refills because the only peg refill set I see on Amazon is still not enough. Very frustrating!"
1,Not enough pink pegs!,"I would avoid this packet unless you already have about 60 pink pegs and 30 violet pegs. We had the pegs from the Lite Brite, plus the pegs from this packet, PLUS a 100 peg refill and the pegs from another packet (Littlest Pet Shop). We still had to use orange to complete it. Best to avoid."
3,Fun for Kids,This product kept my daughter entertained but did not include enough pegs to do as directed. She already had pegs plus received another set with extra pegs to add to the extra pegs included with these sheets. Plus with lights out you can't really tell what the picture looks like. Not real satisfied with the product.
4,Lite Brite Refil--a fun change,My daughter loves the themed lit-brite refil for something different. My Little Pony is fun and a theme that she enjoys. It is great for anyone who loves My Little Pony products and hard to find besides online. It's nice that it comes with some extra bonus pegs that are good for the theme.
5,MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW,"Colorful and educational are the two words that would best describe this delightful Christmas book for the little one.Each page brimming with full color pictures of such things as, Animals at the Stable, including the camel, sheep, donkey, dove and cow. Adorable.Another page is filled with tree decorations, such as tinsel, bows, a star and ornaments.This is a great little book to introduce your child to many of the traditions of Christmas. It is sturdy, colorful and chock full of learning information.A very good read to share with your child as you pass along the many wonders of the Christmas Season."
5,Great for babies!,"My daughter was 8m when I bought this book for her. She LOVED it-there were lots of pictures for her, the pages were easy to turn, and when she chewed on it, the book held up perfectly (no tearing). Will be buying other ""My First"" board books for sure!"
1,petmate litter roundup,all this was past tense stop working in a month paid 79.99 is a hyped up litter box can not find a number to ask for partial payment back
1,Disappointed,"Urine saturated litter stuck to the bottom of the pan; the rake bent while trying to scoop it ( I use the scoopable litter as suggested). Per the manual I tried to remove the rake from the motorized arm to clean the tray and couldn't get it off. My husband tried also and was unsuccessful; he wound up striping the rake threads while using pliars and had to use silicone to keep it permanently in the scooping position. I now have to push the button to get the rake in the up position to remove the tray to clean it. The rake also throws litter over the collection tray and all over my floor. Other than the aggravation, mess and use of a less-than perfect device it's ok."
1,Got it on sale and it still wasn't worth it.,I finally threw this litter box out and bought another litter maid box. This box never worked correctly. It always left waste behind. I was always having to mess with it to try and get it to work. The scoop never really performed correctly. It was not worth the hassle at all.
1,Dont waste your money,"One month this money scooper lasted. My cats were scared of this thing at first then they got used to it. So used to it that they would attack it, there is no safty shutdown so if a cat is in it, it wont start. My cat got his tail caught in the rank and was louder than the motor. On that subject, the noise the litter box is tooo much. I cant sleep with it, and its down the hall 5 doors down. The rake does not drop the poop just takes it for a ride and puts it back in the litter box. Buy this if you want. But your will be sorry."
4,I love the Round Up,"After reading the other reviews I was wondering if I wanted to take the product back before trying it. However, I have found the product excellent. I have been using Littermaid products for the past 8 years and have been frustrated. But in the month that I have been using the Round Up I have found that it does a better job in cleaning the litter of cat waste. I find that corn based litter works very well with itThe product is not any noiser than other automatic/electric litter boxes. I will get the hood only because i have a cat aspiring to be a place kicker."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is possibly the worst self-cleaning litter box I have ever seen. I decided to buy one about 4 years ago and 2 weeks after getting it, the rake started getting stuck and making this loud clicking noise. After a few weeks, I got fed up with it and decided to give it go, and bought a new one. It did the exact same thing. I now own a Litter Maid, and so far it has worked out."
1,BEWARE!,"I bought this one because the gears broke on the first one I bought. So this was to be my ""replacement parts"". The gears on these are poorly made and the setup in the gear box is crazy! Once something goes wrong in it that's it you litter box no longer functions correctly. I owned the first litter box for 8 months (lost my receipt) before the gears were so messed up all it ended up being was a manual scoop. BEST ADVISE! If you buy one of these KEEP your receipt. That is the only way you can get your money back or get a replacement.Anyway, there was a defect in this new one too. I tried using it for a couple of months and it too became a manual scoop. I had really high hopes for a automatic litter box. If it had worked it would have been a dream come true. This box and the Petmate Litter RoundUP Automatic Litter Box are not worth the one star rating.Again if you purchase this KEEP YOUR RECEIPT! Good luck!"
1,"DONT BUY THIS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND FIND ANOTHER BRAND",This is the worst litter box in the world. I bought mine on 7/16 and by 7/25.... it no longer worked. I tried to clean everything well to make sure no litter was lodged. I tried to have the unit clean the pan more often. It doesnt help!!! The rake gets caught up and makes a clicking noise. This is the most worthless way to spend your money. 90.00 dollars will be better in your pocket : )
1,Worst Pet Investment Ever,Paid $89.99. The cleaning arm completely sheared off within a month of use. Left some waste behind. Don't waste your money.
1,Very Poor Construction!,"Giving this one star is too much! There is absolutely nothing good to say about this litter box. My frustration with the two to three times a day cleaning the mess and repairing jams, I threw the entire thing in the trash. I thought after happily using the Littermaid for my three adult cats for over six years, I would try the Petmate. Very disappointed!"
1,Breaks too easily!!,"I had this litter box for two months before it broke, also it is noisier then other automatic litter boxes. And my cats hated it!"
1,waste of money,"this doesn't do anything it advertised. it does not stop and reverse when it encounters a block, it just clicks and tries to keep going. when you use premium clumping litter it is too heavy for the arm. less than premium and it breaks up. the arm does not get all of the waste. the tines are so big the smaller waste slips through. VERY UNHAPPY, sorry i wasted my money!"
2,Not healthy enough to be worth eating such a vile food!,"I actually love Pirate's Booty snacks so I was over eager and purchased 2 huge cases of these. Yikes, these are going to hard to get rid of. A previous reviewer states that they are like fish food and I second that notion. I would definitely recommend steering clear of these, and choosing one of the much better flavors like cheese. I don't know exactly how to describe these, but imagine a stale sock soaked in broccoli juice and you're on the right track. My typically non-discriminating 14 month old turns his nose up at these. These taste like something super healthy, and though they aren't bad for you, they are not healthy enough to warrant choking them down. They are worth a try as a toddler snack, but I'd order cautiously or you will have lots of fish food tasting snacks that you will be trying to give away to any unsuspecting victim that will take them off of your hands."
3,"Odd, but it grows on you a bit","At first bite, this turned off 4 of us. The kids, who are veggie nuts, and eat raw spinach by the handful, did not care for the snacks at all. The adults kept nibbling, thinking it might get more palatable with time. We eventually decided to try it as a snack with red wine, as the slightly salty slightly bitter taste might blend really well with a hearty wine.I expected more judging from the other reviews, and I guess I should have just seen ""spinach and kale"" and realized that I should not have bought 24 bags to try something new. Still, it's not awful -- just a bit odd. Perhaps I will test mixing it with the caramel booty!"
1,Tastes and smells like goldfish food!,"I should know, I've eaten goldfish food when I was a kid. When I ate this stuff it was the same experience. Flavorless, unpleasant smell. Looks like green packing peanuts! Never again!"
4,yummy and makes a great first finger food too!,"we got these are having some of a friend's. our 10 month old actually liked them, and since they are much better for her than gerber puffs we bought a case. she has since decided to be picky and not eat them anymore, but the rest of us love them, including my 2 year old. they make a healthy and surprisingly tasty snack!"
1,salty greens-flavored styrofoam,"The title pretty much sums it up. I wanted to like these, but they have the texture of a styromfoam packing peanut. They very much taste like spinach or some other greens and are way too salty. yuck!"
2,Two Gun Man From Harlem,"I liked the movie alright, however, the quality of the film was too dark and murky. I realize that the film, at the time it was made, it was not in the best quality. I also understand that the movie was made in 1939. So dismissing, the above, the film was fine."
3,Interesting Commentary,"Interesting commentary on a slice of society we seem to only know from the entertainment shows or gossip sections of newspapers. It should be noted that this book is dated. In over 10 years, I am sure Aspen has changed some and the main players have changed or just been replaced.The author writes well, has insightful commentary. Some reviews complain that the book jumps around and is a bunch of ""mini"" stories. I thought the book flowed well. The author took different jobs and moved through different circles of Aspen society, so the book had to move with him.If you ever did the ""circut"" of working resort jobs: beach towns in the summer and ski resorts in the winter, this book may resonate more with you than someone who has never lived in a resort town. It certainly is a society of us and them of the many sub-groups/cultures that inhabit those towns and the author captures that very well.Overall, an easy and enjoyable read, with some thought provoking passages and commentary."
4,Preview,The programmer leaves his woman alone in the house with a terminal off the main frame computer in the basement. The computer has his way with her and is born. Wow a computer gets lucky!
4,a rival for hal,"a superior science fiction film from the 70s about computer paranoia. how silly they were back then: thinking those machines could ever take over our lives! julie christie (stunning as always) is the victim of a rape by a computer -- dont ask -- who wants to have a child of its own, and the parallels to ""rosemarys baby"" are perhaps a bit too many, but this is proof of a wonderful time when this type of movie was about the story and not about spending millions on special effects. intelligent and well worth your time."
5,excellent,This movie was the best and surly we should all become aware of machines taking over as they will one day. It was very sexy.
5,Review of Shylocks Daughter,"This book is set at a Jewish ghetto in Rome in the twelfth century but adresses issues that I see are in our world today. Issues of racial and religious prejudice, greed and pride and authority figures and teenagers love and reality. Jessica is born in her fathers frugal ways and strict following of the Jewish rules. It is based on the Merchant of Venice and is a story full of adventures and surprises."
5,Very Clear With Lots Of Versatile Designs,"My hobby is crafting and I was given this book as a birthday present by one of my crafting friends. I haven't been able to put it down!I love my craft books and can honestly say the techniques section is one of the best with lots of tips and ideas I have not seen before. The cards are amazing and the step by steps easy to follow. Sue has included lots of ideas to adapt the cards and although aimed at children her ""Kids Korners"", (what a great idea), are inspiring for adults too.I often tend to look at card projects in my books but never seem to get around to doing any! I have already made two from Sue's. A fun hidden message that had my husband going mad and a pop up teddy bear for my nieces birthday. This book deserves the five stars."
5,You must get this book!!,"If you want to send cards that will NEVER be thrown away, try these easy to follow steps. Great ideas with many that can be used in scrapbooking.Have a good day!"
4,sweet!,"This book has lots of pictures so it’s easy to follow and it’s even easier to change the subject of the card and mix and match ideas. It has very, very cute ideas in it! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because you need to have some knowledge of what you are doing, it’s not a beginner book (but I loved it!!!)"
2,These do not fit a 2005 Ford Explorer with a V6,"These pads did not fit my vehicle, a 2005 Ford Explorer V6. Maybe they fit the V8 version. Unfortunately I damaged them when trying to install them so they were not returnable."
2,I Gave this Book Away,"Once I received this book, I was disappointed in the content. The activities inside were not revolutionary, I could've come up with these things myself. I didn't need to spend money on this. I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Maybe a Title Malfunction?,"Translated-- Traumerei???Plastic Tree has an album called Toroimarai???Thats so similar that I think it was maybe a typo??In this case, if it is that CD, I'd want it, but I don't trust the translation.I wanna see an image and a track list before I'd buy this CD.*heads up* the last track ame ni utaeba is AWESOME!!!anyways, who ever is selling this, can you make sure of what it is???"
5,"""There was a family that lived on the isle of St. Sebastian a long, long while...""","Excellent, somewhat campy, often genuinely creepy film from the fine French director Jacques Tourneur, I Walked with a Zombie is less well-known than his famous Cat People but perhaps even more accomplished. Something of a Jane Eyre story recast in the West Indies, the film features an added treat in watching the calypso great Sir Lancelot act as a kind of Greek chorus, narrating the action."
4,"""I Walked with a Zombie"".","I haven't seen ""The Body Snatcher"", but I think this could perhaps be a stylistical mismatch: in fact, ""I Walked with a Zombie"" is not a mainstream horror movie; it is rather a psychological and dreamlike thriller. However, it is a haunting and very elegant movie. Highly recommended."
3,I Walked With a Zombie,"I had heard a lot about this piece, it was worth seeing. Comparing it to Wide Sargasso Sea--I would have to prefer the latter. I found the action rather static and the time-elapse of the action hard to figure out. Sir Lancelot is one of the best things in the movie--he was very good as the Calypso singer."
1,Itself Malware,"Shut down--not merely quarantined-- all Lexmark Printing, Scanning, Copying, Faxing files that came from this reputable All-in-One manufacturer. Thus a program that deletes other, useful, known safe programs=malware!"
2,"Definitive - Yes, Effective - No","I'm surprised so many people have given this book a good review. I went with this book after the O'Reilly book was back ordered. What a mistake. The book might cover every formatting object in the W3C XSL-FO recommendation, but it's more like reading just that, the recommendation (which can be found online).It's a bulleting of objects with minimal examples and sometimes difficult to understand explanations. I'm giving it two stars only because it serves as a useful quick formatting object reference to me at this point.Avoid this book if you're new to XSL-FO. Otherwise, if you're looking for a reference guide, this might fit what you need."
2,Not a learning tool,"Minimal examples, very little ""big picture"" orientation, long reference-style lists with minimal explanation of terms if any, and gives short shrift to how XSL:FO works with XSLT. The omission of fo: prefixes in examples is a an auctorial preference I find particularly annoying. Unfortunately it appears to be difficult to locate alternative books."
2,So many words saying so little,Bought this book a couple hours ago. I'm up to page 53 and so far all I've learned is that the author can talk and talk and talk and not say anything useful. This book is extremely painful and I'm not sure there will be any reward at the end. Unfortunately the O'Reilly book on the subject is out of print and this is about all there is ... nothing would almost be better.
4,The complete explanation of XSL-FO,"The book covers all the topics mentioned in W3C XSL 1.0 Recommentation. I found other books only covers part of it. But I found the book like to present topics in point form, some readers may not like this style. Also, it separated the description of formatting properties from formatting object like the W3C XSL 1.0 Recommentation, I think this approach is not so helpful because readers cannot thoroughly read each formatting object and related things in one place until he reached the appendix."
1,GEE~!!,"You got to be kidding right ~!?? If you are an Intelligent Human Being, use common sense please ~! LOL You can not loose ONE body part by wearing this kind of gadget! LOL ~!!! You got to loose entire body fat mass by cardio work out, plus eat good. PERIOD. Gee, I could come up with TONS of silly Gadget like this to become a millionaire for silly consumers !! can not believe people actually spend a penny on these things ~! LMAO~!!! People are cute~!!"
5,"Wherever,Whenever","Shakira is one the best artist that is out right now. ""Wherever,Whenever"" is one of the many explosive songs off her last album ""Laundry Servive""(2001).Shakira mix of rock ,pop, dance and latin music is very pleasing, and she is one of the only artist who can pull this off without going to far.Some call her a another ""blond"" in the music buisness but Shakira actually writes and produces her own songs unlike the other ""blonds"".I belive Shakira will be out and making beautiful music for a long time!"
2,2 stars,"I don't like this single, because here are too less songs. And the songs aren't so good. Don't buy it."
5,Pittsburgh Punk Rock at its best by a young punk fan,"This is by far Anti-Flag's most politcally charged album. I couldn't think that their music could get any better than ""Die For Your Gov't"" but it can, and with this album ""Underground Network."" Politically charged with songs like ""Culture Revolution"" ""Vieques, Puerto Rico: Bikini Revisited"" ""Panama Decption"" and tons more. My personal favorite is ""Culture Revolution"" There is not much more to say other than the fact that this song and others make me wanna get up and just break stuff. It gets you so pumped up and with a message that is understandable. PS. In this album #2 Chris sings, and it adds a nice dimension to the band, but you still have to love Justin's voice....."
5,audio indymedia,"I bought this album last week along with ""Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes"" by Propagandhi, they are both musically great, and lyrically if you're not already involved in any social action make you want to be..."
1,Poseur rock,"Well, they're poseurs. Plain and simple. 3rd generation political punk rehashed and remixed in a nice shiny package. Muscially and message-wise, they are not bad, but I can't shake the feeling that I've heard this all and seen their poses before... and a long time ago."
1,this cd [stinks],"At one time this band was pretty good, however, these last 3 albums have just [stunk] more than the last. Its generic, boring, annoying (voice), and just [stinky]. This band for made for the warp tour just poppy punk whinning about everything while they pack up on their expensive tour bus."
4,Anti-Flag holds strong& earns a new reputation for FAT WRECK,"Anti-Flag surprised the bejesus out of me on this one; i thought for sure they would become lost in the generic sounding punk rock world owned by Fat Wreck Chords and Epitaph... but the records great! Its the most political one yet; it may not be the most rockin' (a couple of the songs are on the medium-paced ""poppy-sound"" side) but hey... BUY IT ANYWAYS! You won't be dissapointed. promise. The lyrics refer to things that are gonig on today, and so it gives you a sense of comfort knowing that these records are being sold to kids all over the world. Now every one both young and old can know about the deeds of our fascist state... from the WTO in Seattle to U.S. occupation of Vieques...this record very well could start a Culture Revolution, as on of the songs is titled. If you like good punk, you'll love this album."
3,Rust appeared..,"Some rust on the meatl ring connecting the bag and the straps after about a month's use. The flaking metal is eating into it's straps think it's bound to tear after some time. Not covered by lifetime warranty as it is considered wear and tear, misuse or neglect. Rest of the bag is pretty sound though."
3,beware the mistakes,"I bought this book because it was the only one that B&N had. While reviewing it, there have been a few times where I've said to myself, ""Wait a minute. That makes absolutely no sense."" I thought it was just me until I heard from other people as well about all of the errors. There are some blatant errors in examples in this book, such as units conversion or solving for something completely different than what was asked. And if the errors in the examples are this bad, it makes me wonder what sort of errors are contained in the review sections. Personally, I just ordered the same style book from another publisher, and I'm going to throw away this book when the new one comes."
1,FE Exam Review book,"This book was very unhelpful for the preparation necessary for the FE Exam. The problems published were not very similar to problems that were on the actual test. Also, many of the solutions were wrong in the back of the book."
2,Just because its the only one at barnes and noble don't buy it...,-Gross mistakes in the text that lead to confusing and hard to understand solutions-Solutions skip a lot of steps-Overall written very poorly-Unnecessarily large font makes for a huge book
2,"Not bad, could be much better","The book help me review for the exam but it could be much better. Basically, If I'm finding mistakes in the book, something is wrong. I found some sample problems with units that were incorrect (ie Pressure, N*m^2 instead of N/m^2) and a few times the worked exam problems would be have different units or would be change from meters to millimeters.Overall, the book did help me during the exam, but if I was going to do it over again, I would purchase a different review book."
1,Many many errors,"The amount of errors, even with things as simple as addition, make studying a real burden. Several times on the tests I have gotten an answer that doesn't match any of the multiple choices, but on comparison with the solutions my entire formula is correct and they messed up the algebra at the end.The list of contributing professors in the front made me laugh, I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this book."
2,Lots of errors and typos,"It is fun to have the test on a cd, I guess. (That's why I chose it, although the actual test is paper based, so I am not sure why I bothered.) The CD isn't worth the frequent mistakes. The morning exam, for instance, contains at least 4 major errors (out of 120 questions) There may be more among the dozen or so questions that I have no clue about. The interface does not actually make it easier to target the difficulties - I had to copy by hand all of the problems I got wrong so I could look them up in the explanations mode.Some of the other prep books have errata online - REA doesn't. The text is visually challenging and poorly written. I wish I had purchased a different book."
1,not helpful & full of errors.waste of your money,I used this book to study for the fe and I didn't find it to be helpful at all.Some of the material is outdated especially computer stuff.The book is full of errors.explainations are not clear.wish i had never come across this book.it was a waste of my money n time.
1,Boring,"This was a total disappointment. Acting is really bad and laughable because of it. These people do not act and look ridiculous when they talk, move or a simple thing like standing still looks awful on screen aaagggh. I hated it even though I tried hard to like it, since the visual effects are more or less acceptable and that's about it. Avoid this movie like a plague it is bad and boring too much talking and no action, horror, passion, blood, nothing!!! Or at least nothing that can be believed."
5,A must read,"This is a must read for african american woman who have considered going natural, also this a must read for other cultures who want to understand the fixation that african american woman have about our hair and why it is a billion dollar industry. Heck, everybody should read it..."
4,It's about time!!,"I loved this book! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wanted MORE information about the subject. It's nice to finally find a book that actually focuses on the history and politics involved with our (Afrikan) hair. We seem to overlook why we do certain things with our hair and it's nice to find a book that begins to look at those things. Hopefully the book will help to enlighten others. I consider myself to be someone who knows EVERYTHING about Black hair and I learned many new things from this book that I was not aware of. Also, it's not a long book; you can breeze through it in a day or two."
4,Unleashed my Baggage,"A wonderful book indeed! Through the comprehensive history of black hair, I was finally able to let go of the stress that (for my entire life) I associated with my own hair. It definitely ""untangled my roots""!! I was most captivated and inspired by the fact that black hair has fascinated the world for centuries! Hair Story is undoubtedly a book for the black community, it has the ability to give us insight so that we may be able to regain the social, political and economic strength of our ancestors."
5,Awesome Read!,"Ladies and Gents, this book is Awesome! Words cannot describe how wonderful and refreshing it is to find a book that describes the history of African American hair! This book is a collector's item. I think I am going to buy this book for every young black girl that I know. I think this book should be a required read for every young girl before she starts to put any type of chemical, weave, or dye in her hair. Don't get me wrong...the authors do a great job of not picking sides.. naturals vs. relaxers vs. weaves....they explore our hair in general from our twisted roots of slavery to the jheri curls of the 80s...brilliantly written!I do have one small pet peeve with this book in that it does take a few jabs at the sorority in which I belong but nevertheless I think it is an excellent book...well worth the purchase!...Thanks so much for this book!"
3,Decko Bath Products 14' Over Door Hanger,"I would have given this product a 5 except for I had to remove a metal piece on the back to allow the door to close. By removing the metal tab it requires that you screw the top into the door. But, the screw kept the door from closing so I had to rig it to stay in place. Once in place, it does hold quite a lot of clothes."
3,Didn't fit our doors,"For a $4 clothes hanger, this item was fine, however it was too deep to fit our doors properly. It comes with two smaller screws you can use to screw into the top of the door, but I didn't want to install this permanently...if I wanted a permanent attachment I would use something altogether different.We have one we inherited with our house, same idea, but better execution on the door attachment part. It uses more of a clip to hold it on, and folds away when not in use. If I could only find one like it."
1,Did Not Need It,I found that I did not need this cord assembly. The Oster massager came fully equipped with one. I would like to return it to Clippercenter.com in Redford MI and have my mone refunded. Do you agree?
3,Not correct weight,"The description says 4 lbs, on the bag it says 48oz (3lbs) Its only 3 lb bag I would not have ordered it if I knew that, so be warned"
1,marcellus osceola,EUa800 doesn't work i have call the company can you help me exchange the product thanks email me back when you'll have time for me. Marcellus
5,"Orion Telescope Tube Rings, 76mm",All my orders from Orion Telescope arrive very quickly. I appreciate their 76mm tube rings. The image does not do them justice. They really are a nice set.
1,never got it,"i suggest you do not buy this item. i have not yet received these, ant i ordered them on January 27nth.it is march 3rd, and still no chocolate roses!"
3,sofnit washable underpad,"THis product is ok, not for overnight protection. I change the pads at night when wet and this did not hold. I will use for sitting in the chair not bed again."
4,washable underpad,"The sofnit washable underpad is very comfortable to lay on. Even after numerous washings it still lays flat, no wrinkles at all."
4,"Excellent quality, leaky around edges","I purchased this for extra floor protection for my dogs that are trained on puppy pads. They were going on the edges or next to the disposable pad, so I bought one of these to put under the disposable to cover a larger area. It worked so well that I discontinued the disposables and bought another one of these so I have one when I'm washing one. No more tracking like the disposables, but if they get close to an edge you can see that it soaked through to the back side. These are good quality material and not fuzzy feeling like the smaller ones I purchased. Overall very pleased."
5,Used for guinea pigs,"I bought one of these because I wanted an absorbent reusable pad for my piggies when I have them on the carpet or on the bed, couch, etc. They hold the urine, no leaks :)Perfect for what I bought it for"
2,washable sofnit underpads,These pads are not good they do not absorb the fluid at all it runs off the pad on to the surface. I got these two times before and they were great but the new shinny matteral now used are not good.They returned my money with no prob.
4,"Good, but","I expected them to last longer. Bought 4 in September, 2012 for Mom.Used every day and washed, Mom said they are now leaking thru.They still ""look"" great and wash up nice, but if they leak.... That doesn't make a difference.She now puts 2 under her at night, because of the leakage, and that concerns me as I don't want her to get bed sores from the doubling up.I just bought another brand that holds 50oz. I will wait awhile to review them, and will post a review to let you know.Suggestions....buy enough to let them air dry after washing instead of putting them in the dryer.Think they will last longer. Also, I will date the new ones to see how long they last."
4,"Good absorbancy, but they slide around","Purchased these recently and found they are fairly absorbent for the overflow at night for my mother. Only complaint is they slide around easily in bed and have held up well with washing. Make sure your first line of denfense (adult diapers/""underwear"" are maximum absorbancy for overnight."
3,"ok for absorption, wash ability, and softness, not the best for leak protection","main problem is that the backing is not totally water proof and odor proof . It becomes damp and lets some odor through. I put a towel on top and double pads which work ok . Patient has late stage Alzheimer, wears diaper with booster pad, for overnight protection."
1,waste of money,this mat does not hold water or other liquid-I will not recommend it to anyone who is looking for quality product
2,disapointed,i like tha bed liner. but for tha amount of mony i expected more then one liner. no i would not recomend this
3,Slide everywhere,"I am not totally bedridden and so get in and out of the bed to go to the bathroom, eat, etc. These pads just slide all over the bed. I am always having to straighten the pad when getting back into bed. When I wake up in the morning the pad has moved every which way with part hanging off the bed. Not comfortable. Perhaps if you don't move around in the bed this would be a good pad but not for others."
2,THEY MAKE MY REAR SWEAT!,"Probably the only item from Amazon that I'm disappointed with. I had 2 pads made in early 2000 that was lost in recent move. I thought these looked about the same... however, I read reviews about the material being very different from older products. Some complained about the pad slipping. I agree they slip around and wrinkle up during normal body movement. The big problem is... the slippery plastic type material will make your rear SWEAT... Not simple perspiration.I put this pad under mattress cover... which doesn't protect the bed sheets in case you occasionally leak. I will try another more expensive product from Amazon."
4,Very good (nearly excellent),"Only four stars, since I'm not sure I could have followed the intertwining stories if I hadn't read the books -- and, of course, I noticed every place where the videos deviated from the books, especially when it didn't seem necessary for brevity or clarity. But I think this was a masterful attempt to bring these stories to video, and enjoyed every minute of all six episodes."
1,Beware beware!,"I was so excited to finally receive Case Histories being such a fan of the Kate Atkinson novels. But when I put it into my DVD player, the player couldn't play it - the DVD made in the UK was not compatible with my Australian DVD player. So alas, no watching for me. Make sure you have the right DVD player before buying this!"
1,Don't buy one of these.,"I had one, and it caught fire during a show. Not cool. Typical awful Chauvet build quality."
2,Perhaps they'd been drinking...,"I'd love to see the faces of the thousands of parents on Christmas morning getting their first look at what is inside the box. The zoo is in about 1,000 tiny pieces randomly sorted into dozens of little bags. My first thought was that this was a practical joke. Now I think that the designer was simply sadistic.Don't believe me? There are 144 little, tiny red connector pieces used to put the thing together. Not to be confused with the 64 tiny yellow connector pieces also used. Each flower pot involves installing every individual flower -- of which there are over 50. The pretend flood light (yes, they really have not one, but two. Not sure what it adds in play experience) are in five different pieces each. Were they drunk?In fairness, I would add say that the IKEA style directions work pretty well and I put it together in about 3 hours. They also shorted me a tree, but I can't imagine my son will notice."
2,Found this book showy and impractical,"This book seemed to be more about the author and his acquaintances rather than about the dog itself. I was hoping there would be a lot more meat: sources other than the author's opining and the penchant towards show dogs. I was looking for a functional manual on living with, training and caring for a Boston. What I got instead was a testament to the breed and pictorials of various show dogs and what seemed to be the author's friend's dogs. This book was a fair treatment of the breed but not at all what I would recommend for a practical ""owner's guide."""
5,Must read for new Boston owners,"This is a must read for new owners of a Boston Terrier. Lots of good info. Actually, I would recommend that you read this prior to purchasing/adopting a Boston to get an idea if a Boston is right for you."
1,Cannot recommend this one,"Meade's dvd ""Essentials of Swedish Massage"" is fantastic. Based on that, I purchased his ""Deep Tissue: Shoulder Girdle"" dvd. The enthusiasm and passion he displayed in his Swedish dvd presentation was sadly lacking in this one. I'm a professional massage therapist and review Meade's Swedish Massage dvd a lot. I never grow tired of it. That's the one I recommend."
4,Being very much satisfied,Though this book was published more than 10 years ago. This hard cover is really well preserved.The contents of the book is still a big problem in Japanese journal areana. I thought I have to do something to make Japan one of real democratic nation. I feel shame of its cartel formation. I would like to try as a free lancer to attned some local government briefing amomg resitered journalists.I will see what it is like.The very luchy thing about the book is a real writer's autogrogh on the back of the cover.It was shipped very quickly. I am satisfied with your prompt service.Thank you so much.Sadami NImoda
3,Brother's Keeper,"All and all it's a pretty good CD. There some really cool concert footage for your computer at the end of the cd which alone is worth checking out the cd.Musically, it's not the greatest hardcore cd I've ever heard, but far from the worst. I'd give it thee and a half stars if I had the option."
5,Silver & Stone: Profiles of American Indian Jewelers,"Having met a couple in the review, and purchased a number of their products, I found the book beautifully illustrative, and full of very engaging human interest stories."
2,Not Recommended,"I found this book to be disappointing. Instead, I recommend both of Dexter Cirillo's hardback Native American jewelry books. This book is paperback and printed on low grade paper and the photography is not the best I've seen. Too many of the photographs are dimly lit or grainy. I found it irritating that every time I saw a large photograph of jewelry - it never listed the details of the particular piece of jewelry(type of turquoise, gem or coral, etc.) Some of the information wasn't correct. The book seems somewhat amateurish - to me. Dexter Cirillo is an expert - the photographs in her books are outstanding, and the books are gorgeously printed on high grade paper. Do yourself a favor and spend the additional $10 - $15 and buy her two luxurious hardback books instead. You will treasure them for years to come."
4,"Not a reference, use in conjunction with oracle docs","A lot of reviewers are knocking this book because it's not a comprehensive reference. While it does contain some valuable reference information, it's real value is not as a reference, but as an actual guide to using the language's features to construct useful, working code.At this, it's excellent. For example: Need to understand how to intelligently use exception blocks? Don't look in the Oracle docs; you'll get the correct syntax, but not much else. This is true for many of the topics the book touches on.The author does spend a lot of time on programming fundamentals, (modularization, comments, good style, etc.) but considering how precise you need to be, and the specific challenges of debugging and deploying server side PL/SQL code, a little dose of rigor can be a good thing."
2,Database Developer,"Im an experienced SQL Server developer.I used this book to learn PL/SQL, while this book isvery detailed but it is HIGHLY disorganized.It assumes you know everything. It talk about issues insome chapter, while defines the concepts used in that issue in the future chapters!!!!This makes this book a very ""BAD"" resourse for beginners.For a 900+ pages book the number of examples are very limited!Buy this book ""only"" IF you are already an expreinced OracleUser and you need a review.Otherwise this is not for you.Regards."
3,Be careful,"Although the book is a solid introduction to PL/SQL, the author has some serious biases related to coding style and structure that you must be extremely leery with: implicit versus explicit cursors, functions should not have side effects, plus several others. Take it all with a grain of salt, and read the books written by Jonathan Lewis and Tom Kyte, which help to dispell some of the myths that Feuerstein advocates."
4,Very good,"This is an easy to read book. Feuerstein presents a good overview and in-depth analysis of the PL/SQL language with practical examples. He includes several examples and recommendations that make this a solid book for PL/SQL programmers. Some print errors are commons in books of this type, they are obviously a problem for a newbie, but there is no perfect book at this world. For this reason I give only 4 stars."
2,4th Edition is more dense and less accessible,"While the 3rd Edition has some quirks beyond those of the 2nd Edition, the 4th Edition includes topics presented in other books published since its last edition. Clearly, on a weight basis it is heavier than Deitel's books and a bit more dense read that assumes a substantial background in PL/SQL.The pontification section in the 4th Edition is humorous. Maybe it should be titled ""Object-oriented programming is too complex for me."" Why the fourth edition isn't available here on Amazon is strange but it is available on the O'Reilly site?"
1,useless as a reference,"As a moderate users of PL/SQL I purchased the book both as a reference manual and to chart the differences between Oracle 8 and 9.I found the book useless in both regards. It is difficult to look for specific items as the book is organized as a teaching guide and not a users guide.In addition, coverage of how to use and program stored procs and triggers is inadequate at best. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,not at all what I thought it would be,"I was looking for the sound track of the movie ""you must be this tall"" and it was not that. I was very disappointed."
4,buy this album,"I listned to this album and I was entirely blown away. With the melodic basslines and precision guitar of 88 fingers louie, the incredible drumming from pinhead circus and the heartfelt lyrics of former baxter frontman, rise against carries on where 88 left off but add their own twist to it. (On a side note, people interested in this album may want to check out the new band from 88's frontman ""the story so far"")"
3,"Not their best, too messy","Being their first album, it's no surprise that RA's sound is very undeveloped on this album. It's basically just raw punk with no clear melody.Every album they have done after this one has been a much better example of their personalized sound and pure talent."
3,"The Unraveling,well it is unraveling","This is a great cd from Strung -Out to Thrice,these bands have accomplished the makings of this kind of music. When I heard Rise Against for the first time, i said I gotta have this CD. Although I have never heard any other cd's from Rise Against I think this type of music they are playing will make them succesful. Make sure to see them on tour with Strung-Out,they are a great band,with jamming guitar parts,awesome bass lines,drums beats that are too good,and excellent singing. Buy this CD and I hope you will like it."
3,I'm Terribly Sorry,"I absolutely love Rise Against. They easily fall under my list of favorite bands. Their last album was without a doubt their best and I'm looking forward to their upcoming one. But this album is them at their worst. The only song that as good as the standout ones on other albums is Everchanging. And even then, its not one of their best. The rest of the songs are loud and obtrusive, like a good deal of their other stuff, but not good, which makes it terrible. If I didn't like their other albums so much i would give this an easy two stars."
5,Excellent book-very detailed approach,"Not only the author knows COM+ in detail, he also knows how to express the ideas very well. The book covers enough details of all the aspects of COM+. The examples are easy to understand. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning this subject."
5,This could be the bag for you too!,"This bag is good looking, you can already see that. I can tell you that it is made well, but it isn't meant for anyone wanting to carry a laptop and a bunch of other items as well. You can definitely do either/or but with a 15"" laptop in it, the bag does not leave much space for anything other than small office supplies (paper, pens, things like that).Without a laptop in it, this thing could carry a ton. Either way, it has more than enough space for practical uses. It feels good on the shoulders and will help you win a sword fight. Maybe not, but it is a really nice bag.No real organizational pockets though."
1,PHD (Piled Higher and Deeper),"The authors peers and superiors may find this text exemplary, but the average undergraduate student looking for an introductory textbook will find it written in an alien language. There are so many $100.00 words included in complex, compound sentences which run 22 lines in the book that it seems to take an hour to translate each page.I am sure the author is a very intelligent man, but he is very ignorant when it comes to communicating with the intended audience. Does he conduct classes in the same way? Have pity on your students. Learn to communicate."
4,Simmering Energy,"I have all of the Final Cut cds created for fitness classes. The great thing about this specific series is the fact that the music songs shift from type of feeling without losing the consistency of the rhythm. If you are a instructor these are great for classes that you have to speak a lot in as there are no lyrics to compete with. Everytime I use this music people make postive comments. They can be used for classes like: aqua, strength, & step. I wouldn't put it out of range for even stretching or pilates or core classes as well. This music is used on various fitness dvds as well- SmartBells dvds, Gin Miller dvds."
5,Interesting,"It was very enjoyable to learn about the west in the days of Deadwood, the place, people and adventures. Ofcourse the real thing is not as exciting as the T.V. series, but I really enjoyed it because its what really happened."
5,Old Deadwood Days,"Excellent book and read. It is a first person account, which is always better than second hand by someone who actually did not experience the information. Gave me a better perspective of the actual daily life of someone who lived thru the times of Deadwood before it became a state. Highly recommend this book & all the other 'Narrativepress' books. After reading this, I purchased several more of these books."
2,Portable Snopes rehashes same old stories.,"Brunvand has been profiting from everyone's love of urban legends for far too long. His books are a waste of trees since he insists on reprinting the same tired stories over and over. This volume is no exception; its only virtue is that it can be read in the bathroom or while lying in bed.Yaawn. I recommend www.snopes.com, the Urban Legends Reference Page, for far more entertainment in the form of fresh, tasty urban legends and no dead trees. Visiting the Snopes site is not without risks -- the endless theorizing about the role urban legends play in controlling social behavior is quite boring, and Barbara Mikkelson's (Mrs. Snopes) passion for cutsey ""internyms""[i.e., Joe ""I Wrote It"" Smith] is seriously annoying. Be warned, though -- take the ""disturbing image"" labels seriously, or you may see some pictures that will stick in your mind far longer than you'd like."
3,Too Weird to be True,"Many of the stories in this book are amusing, some unbelievable and many are plain gross. For the most part, they are unverified stories of the sort someone would whisper in your ear, ""Did you hear the one about..."" One story that I thought would be in the book, but was not, was the roach-in-the taco that was reported by the New York Times a couple of years ago. Despite that, there were nasty enough stories about fast food.Thyis is a a collection of sometimes dubious stories that entertain to a degree but I think there are other books that I would prefrer to read.most of the reviewers here are teenagers, who are probably the group this book was written for."
3,I thought so,"I heard all the stories growing up. Most of them anyway. Some of them I even believe until I read this book. It is amazing how vulnerable we can be to urban legends. Just because she said that he said. Kind of like all the arguments and debates about vitamins whether they don't or do work. I recall the whole eggs debate, butter And a host of other savory items that were supposed to be really super bad for you... But I guess it was just a country crock… No pun intended"
5,the best,this is the best book on urban legends. It has pretty much every urban legend u can think of... and more!
4,beautiful,"Beautiful, sensual, erotic, intelligent. I'd recommend not reading all the stories in one go. Take some time with this one, it'll make the writing and images seem all more real and meaningful."
4,A good supplement to daily devotionals,"As a non-liturgical evangelical Christian, I have missed the heritage of honoring those earlier generations of Christians who provide examples of piety, perseverance and sacrifice from which our generation could learn. Webber compiles writings by and about those earlier Christians who are honored by Episcopalians throughout the year, from the earliest martyrs, such as Stephen, James, the brother of Our Lord, and Polycarp, to adversaries in the Reformation such as Luther and Thomas More, to 19th and 20th century Christians. Many of these same figures are honored by Catholics, Orthodox and Lutherans by feasts on their calendars as well.There are not entries for every day of the year and I do not always read selections on those days with entries. Nonetheless, if one wants to learn more about 2000 years of saints who await us in eternity, this is an excellent resource."
5,funky downtempo,"Great funky downtempo jazz to get with. Limited distribution for some of these songs, but you can get them here, so go get 'em."
5,"Highly authoritative and governmental, truely mind blowing","I find that this book ""Reformation of the Church"" is none like no other written in this day! It is beyound that of this present century and thus prepare us ""the Church"" for the new millenium. I was totally captivated by the book, in the way and style it was written, truely represents that of an apostolic postion. One like no other book I have read before. I mean I have read books by Dr. Miles Munroe and Dr. Freddrick Price and other great men but this book is in a class by itself. It forces one to change paradigm and shift previous postions into new mentalities and postions where God wants us ""the church "" to be at this time. I highly recommend this book to every spirit-filled 21st Century Believer.Michelle Glenn."
5,An incredibly thorough exploration of this portion of the RG,"As is true for all volumes in the RGS Story series, this book is exceptional. It's a study of the Rio Grande Southern railroad, specifically the portion of the railroad around the towns of Dolores and McPhee (both in southerwestern Colorado, near Durango). There are many hundreds photos and pages of historical accounts not only of the railroad's operations in these towns, but also of the towns themselves. A must for any RGS fan, or anyone interested in the history of this part of the country during the 1890s - 1950s."
3,BROKE!!!,"I really was excited about this stapler. It worked great while it lasted. I bought is the end of August. My return window closed September, 28th. Today is October 4th. This morning I went to use my stapler and the spring flew out and cut my thumb. I tried to put back together, but noticed that the plastic part that held everthing in place is broke. bummer..."
3,Everything in its right place...,"I understand why the people who wrote these other reviews were disappointed. But I don't think this book is useless. If you want a training manual for Visual Studio.NET, definitely go elsewhere. However, if you're like me, and you want to understand how the technologies came about, how they relate to each other, and how they fit into the grand scheme of things, don't write this book off too quickly. There are a lot of good narrative passages that have helped me over some basic humps.I totally agree that the code samples are weak... I'm only on day three and have found examples that just simply DON'T do what the book says they will... But I'm still going to read it for the narrative, and then get another, more training oriented book for learning the IDE's ins and outs."
1,"S =""NO "" & ""GOOD""","I got to page 83 and trashed the book, did anyone proof this. This book would be a nightmare to anybody trying to learn programing, give yourself a break and pass on this one!"
1,An Absolute NO!,"This is one of the worst Programming books I have Ever seen.This book assumes you know everything! It can be a fair book only for a experienced Visual Basic.NET programmer.It does a poor job in teaching, organizing ideas.The book is around 650 pages; it has lots of irrelative stories are inside it.I'm not sorry for the money I wasted on this book but rather for my precious time I wasted on this, while learning very little.Bottom line:If you are trying to learn VB.Net or migrating from VB6 to VB.NET there many better books in the market."
4,good starting book,"ive read these reviews, and im not stupid, but im not exactly the smartest thing. The gripe about this book is the fact that the author gives code but does not explain where to put the code, that it because the author is just showing you what the code will look like. It's like lookin at a window display and realizing that thats just what it looks like, and not what it looks like in your house, i hope that helps, im a big fan of SAMS work, and i hope any beginner seriously buy this book"
3,Dissapointing sound and interpretation,the Karajan from 66 is in all department a more characterful interpretation...Szell in the Pictures is pedantic and the opening of the Great Kiev is dull....Leibovitz did a wonderful recording as well with the Royal Philharmonic. The Kodaly is naturally much better with some very delicious playing...all in all an uneven offering.
3,"Some disappointments, but the price is right.","This performance of Pictures at an Exhibition is uninspired at best. Some of Ravel's beautifully orchestrated material is taken much too lightly by Szell, perhaps because the work is such a warhorse of orchestral repertoire. The Promenade and the Great Gate at Kiev, especially, lack any semblance of excitement. There are much better recordings available.On the other hand, I very much enjoy this recording of the Hary Janos Suite, although the fifth movement is rushed through and the first movement is a bit unconvincing. The Prokofiev sounds quite good, but, as it has been previously noted, suffers from outdated recording technology. Nevertheless I highly recommend the second half of this CD."
2,There's a much better alternative,"The other three reviewers loved this recording, but my own personal response was surprisingly negative (for a great conductor like Ormandy). I just plain didn't like it, and because of it - it was the only recording I had - I didn't really appreciate the symphony either. I *did* learn to love this great symphony when I heard the Eugen Jochum 1964 recording with the the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.Obviously, this is not a music review from an informed critic, but if there is someone out there whose response to the Ormandy was as lukewarm as mine, I cannot recommend the Jochum more highly: it is luminous and wonderful. Get it!"
2,"Bruckner's music curves, but Ormandy walks a straight line","The Bruckner Fifth is an odd choice for Ormandy, who gives no evidence of being sympathetic to the composer's style, or even to understand it. I believe there are some other stabs at Bruckner's symphonies by him, but nothing induces me to seek them out given how stiff and unnatural this performance is. Ormandy had a reputation for splendid orchestral execution and bland interpretations. Here the Philadelphians sound nowhere near as good as the Berliners and the Viennese, and Ormandy tends to punch out accents as if that alone will solve the tricky problems of tempo relationships and disjointed structure that make the Fifth the most difficult of Bruckner's works to bring off successfully. Instead, he walks straight through the score's sinuous curves, and in the process delivers a wooden, unthinking account. Even at bargain price this is a Fifth to avoid."
5,Good tools,Good for use by family member with diminishing dexterity.Bought this as back up for the days when they will have issue to self dress.These will allow them to be self sufficient and dress themselves with out help.
3,"great tool, but SHOCKINGLY overpriced","I bought one of these recently from Lowe's and it's a must for crimping those heavy aluminum sleeves. My application was making cable assemblies using 0.105"" dia string trimmer line and the 3/32"" size sleeves. I had to take care no to overcrimp on the two smallest sizes.Don't even consider trying to crimp even the smallest aluminum sleeves with lightweight crimpers or a hammer.The reason for the 3 stars: Lowe's sells this tool for about $28!!!$86 plus $20 for shipping is just GOUGING!"
4,Excellent Guide,"This is an excellent introduction to the Bhagavad Gita as interpreted by Advaita Vedanta. The author Swami Ranganathananda was inducted into Vedanta by the eminent Swami Sivananda. This book is a tafsir (exegesis) of the Gita in-depth and basically spoon-feeds you the knowledge in a concise and easy-to-read format. However, the book does cost 120 Rupees and this is more like $4 US not $35 so I would suggest buying it direct from Avdaita Ashrama at www.advaitaonline.com"
2,Poor design for walking,"feet hit wheels when you walk. handles are far away from body, causing you to hunch over. it is very lightweight, and easy to fold. took on a trip through airports and train stations and it was very easy to travel with... BUT, the way its designed makes it impossible to walk with. we are trying to return it."
3,OK umbrella stroller,"I got this stroller b/c my friend raved about how wonderful it was. I already own a Maclaren XLR and wanted to downsize to a sturdy smaller stroller b/c the Maclaren is too heavy. After I bought the stroller online and pushed my baby around in it, I realized I didn't like it (Babies R Us didn't have one to test out) b/c my feet kept kicking the back wheels every time I took a step (and I'm only 5 ft!). And it was totally front heavy. It was much more difficult to maneuver than my $20 Babies R US stroller (which I LOVED, but it got worn out after a year...hence the search for a better quality umbrella stroller). I wished I had sucked it up and bought a Maclaren Triumph.Update-I ended up buying a used Maclaren Triumph (I HIGHly recommend this!) and keeping the Chicco umbrella stroller. One for the car and one for at home. The only things I liked about the Chicco are the color (beautiful blue!),the sturdiness, canopy, bag, and price."
4,Good all round,"We purchased this stroller for a Disney Trip. Folds up tightly which as a plus for limited cargo space in the car. Stroller rolls well as compared to my sisters $200+ Maclaren. Only negative is I am 5'11"" and constantly kick the rear wheels. Stroller is a comfortable height, but the rear wheels need to be rotated 180 deg."
2,"High hopes, but very uncomfortable to use.","I had high hopes for this stroller, given the generally positive reviews, the nice features (carrying strap, case) and the super light weight and great color (Topazio). However, within about two minutes of walking with it, I started kicking the wheels (unintentionally, of course) as there is too narrow of a space between them. In order to not kick the wheels, I had to walk in such a way that quickly became uncomfortable for my shoulders and upper back. I'm not sure if it is a height issue (I am only 5'4"") or just a general ergonomics issue. It also had an awfully small seat (my 19 pound 10-month-old seemed liked he'd grow out of it in about 5 pounds), buckles that were very difficult to use, and brake locks/folding mechanisms that were very stiff and difficulty to use quickly/easily. Needless to say, this one is being returned."
4,A FINE UMBRELLA STROLLER,"I purchased this stroller as a second stroller for my now 2 year old - for travel mostly and some quick trips to the store. It serves it's purpose nicely. I love that it has the 5 point harness and is not as ""flimsy"" as a lot of other umbrella strollers out there. The canopy is not very big and the ""recline"" is not either - but for a second stroller - it can't be beat for the price. I'm actually looking to get another one for my son too - 7 months."
4,Good Stroller - Lightweight,"A nice stroller. It's lightweight, easy to transport and my daughter seems to be comfortable in it. The only drawback is that I am 5'9"" and my husband is 6'3"" and the handles could be a little longer."
3,"Serves purpose, mild comfort issues","As a lightweight stroller, it serves its purpose. It actually feels about 10 pounds, fits well inside the trunk and also easy to open and close. The colors available are all sharp and pretty pleasing. It's also hard to get dirty, which is a plus. The downside is that the harness between the legs are sewn in too far distal in the seat so that a smaller kid (and my baby is already 13 months) tend to slide forward in the seat so that he ends up slumped down instead of properly in the angle of the seat. The handlebars are sort of short and your back gets tired easily. Also, my stride is sort of long and my feet keeps on bumping into the wheels."
3,Good for the price,"This was a good stroller for the features it has. It is very light, already put together, collapses easy and the wheels are better than the typical umbrella stroller. I liked the 5pt harness best about it. Good for quick trips and stowing in your trunk.The cons are that the cargo basket is TINY and impossible to get to. The recline is almost nothing. The sun visor isnt as quick to pull out and back, you have to bend the lever, which isnt hard but it doesnt just collapse esily. This isnt the stroller for long trips.Its perfect as a spare stroller, for the grandparents, and quick trips to the store."
4,alaska red,"love the color, the material used because it is strong and durable, love the overall structure of the stroller because its not a delicate piece of furniture - it feels like it can stand up to alot of punishment that a child can dish out. i dont like the handles - i thought it would be easier to handle but its not, and i dont like how difficult it is putting the sun visor on. overall its a good product."
1,ARGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!,"This stroller is awful--i have given myself a blood blister trying to unclasp the 5 point harness plastic clasp. It is so incredibly stiff...when i push the stroller the wheels seem awfully close together and i step on the wheels alot. the price is what drew me in b/c i thought an umbrella stroller was an umbrella stroller...but a friend bought the maclaren and it was a much nicer, smoother push/ride...if i had to do it again, i would spend the extra money and get a nicer lightweight stroller. i dread using it b/c i bought mainly for airport travel b/c we travel alot--i am tempted to put it up for sale on e-bay and buy a better one!"
3,Wouldn't buy again,"I got this stroller after reading Amazon reviews and was not happy with it. I bought it for a long international trip we were taking to Europe and Asia. It's lightweight and pretty compact. It also did well on bumpy roads. Two major problems for me were that it's hard to close and has no storage space. The foot lever took 3 weeks of everyday use to loosen up. For those weeks both my husband and I were using our hands to pull it because it was so tight; not great when you're running to catch a flight. I didn't think the size of the basket would be an issue but it is. To give people an idea of how small it is - I had a small purse with a slim guidebook, small bottle of water and my wallet in it. It would not fit in the basket. I have a cheap umbrella stroller from Babies R Us that I would buy again instead. It's less than half the price and has the same (or smaller) profile."
2,Might work if you're short,"I had to sell this stroller after one use because I kicked the wheels probably a dozen times. Very VERY disappointing because I love the color and style! I'm only 5'6"" so if you're a petite person and not planning on any tall people using it then it may work out just fine for you. Or I suppose if you are a ""baby steps"" type of walker, but I take long strides. Wish the handles were adjustable- they needed to be an extra 3-4 inches higher."
2,A disappointment,"If you're going to spend this much on an umbrella stroller, why not pay a little more to get something better. I was in love with all things Chicco, but now that has changed.The buckle is cheap, heavy duty plastic, poorly designed. I've clipped my fingers numerous times (and it HURTS), as well as my husband and father-in-law, being careful! I am always in fear that it will clip my baby. I have to deal with it every single time I put him in, so it's a major thing.The snap that locks the stroller closed when folded up is worse. It doesn't close unless you put all your effort into it. I don't even bother.And the wheels fold up on the canopy when you close it - dirtying it, no matter how hard you try to keep it clean.It's the little things that make you wonder. Why did I pay so much for this? Now I can't get anything else."
3,Stroller,The stroller is very good. The buckle that closes the stroller when it is folded is defective. It does not work.
4,Great stroller but doesn't withstand lots of pressure,We purchased this stroller for a trip to Disney World. It maneuvers well and handles great. However it doesn't withstand lots of pressure to the wheels. A motorized cart ran into the rear wheel and the wheel snapped off. But over all it is a nice and reliable stroller.
1,Fabric rips and 26 lb child doesn't fit,"Updated review: I've had this stroller less than a year and have had nothing but trouble with it. The canopy ripped twice and the seat ripped once. Now, my child is 26 lbs and doesn't fit in the stroller- I can't close the straps at all. When I called Chicco about it they said won't refund my money because it's not considered a ""manufacturers defect"". This product does not live up to my expectations. I highly discourage everyone from purchasing this product."
3,Just OK...,"I have a Baby Jogger City Mini as my primary stroller and was looking for a lightweight, compact stroller for quick trips in the store etc. After reading the reviews, I decided on the Blue Chicco Capri. It pushes OK and opens and closes very easily, but it has a few minor flaws that disappointed me. First, the crotch strap is way too short...my little girl isn't quite 2 1/2 and when she's buckled in, it's a tight fit. Too bad it's not adjustable. I also find the latch a little tough to buckle and unbuckle. I'm only 5'2"" and I am comstantly kicking the wheels. And, as someone previously mentioned, when folded, the wheels rub the inside of the canopy making it all dirty.It's an OK stroller, especially for quick trips, but if I had to do over again, I'm not sure I'd get it."
4,very sturdy,"this is the second chicco capri stroller we bought. we bought the tangerine one for my son and this topazio one for my daughter (i don't like the pink one). its great, has decent storage for an umbrella stroller and paired with a sunshine kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy, is great for drinks and snacks.the only complaint is that its kinda hard to use the latch to lock the stroller, you really have to press down hard on it.the cover is a great idea, but honestly, in the year that we have had the stroller, we've never used it, as when we travel, we use it in the airport and check it in at the gate.i wish they came in more colors - like purple!"
2,seat does not recline,"Despite the advertising the seat only reclines a fraction of an inch. If reclining is not something you plan on doing, and that would be for an older child and not an infant, this would be a good stroller for you. I have a one year old grandson who needs to sleep and I had to return this stroller because it didn't allow him to do so.Chicco C6 Stroller Tangerinehttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/f9/e9/e56d419328a0db2d566fd110.T.jpg"
3,Doesn't look very comfortable,"I like nearly everything about this stroller - it looks good, it's light weight and fits in the back of my small suv easily, which is what I really wanted it for (I'm small and I hate lugging our Jeep off-roader stroller around in my car). However, there is a problem which I consider a fairly major flaw - the crotch strap is not adjustable and is fairly far forward in the seat (for obvious reasons since it is not adjustable...). This results in my son - who is 5 months old and average size - being very slouched down in the seat, with his lower back not firmly seated against the backrest but instead completely unsupported. I'm considering putting a folded blanket between him and the strap to hold him back on the seat further, but we've only used it a handful of times so far so I've not yet tried this. Will undoubtedly be better for when he is older/bigger, but right now I feel like it's much too uncomfortable for him for more than a quick run into the store."
1,Way to short for me or wife,"We (My wife and I) want to like this stroller, but every time we use it we get back or neak pain becuase of the awkward way we have to push it to avoid kicking the wheels. If the handles were adjustable this would be a great stroller. As is don't buy it if you are taller then 5'6""!!"
3,JUST OKAY,"I BOUGHT THIS STROLLER FOR MY 6 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER AND I DOUBT IT WILL LAST UNTIL SHES EVEN 18 MONTHS. THE MATERIAL IN THE SEAT IS NICE AND UPSCALE, BRIGHT AND VERY ATTRACTIVE BUT THE WHEELS ARE ONLY MADE OF PLASTIC. FOR AN $80 UMBRELLA STROLLER I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING MORE. THE BASKET ON THE BOTTOM IS A JOKE. ITS VERY SHALLOW AND FLIMSY. THE VISOR SERVES ITS PUROPSE BUT I WISH IT WOULD HAVE HAD A WINDOW IN IT SO I WOULDNT HAVE TO STOP AND LOOK AROUND THE STROLLER TO SEE WHAT MY DAUGHTER IS DOING. I TRIED TO CARRY THE STROLLER IN THE BAG IT COMES WITH BUT REALLY, I DONT CARE FOR IT. BOTTOM LINE, IF YOUR ON A BUDGET, SPLURGE ON SOMETHING ELSE. WHEN THIS STROLLER BREAKS IM GOING BACK TO THE GOOD OLE' $20 UMBRELLA STROLLER"
5,"Great stroller, better than typical umbrella stroller","This stroller is great! It's lightweight, easy to maneuver, and collapses and opens easily. If you are looking for an umbrella stroller that is more than an umbrella stroller, get this one. The only drawback is the limited storage."
4,nice little stroller,"this is a nice little stroller. was looking for something for my 7 mo old son that he could grow into & for it to be light weight. this stroller is it. it's actually tall enough for me, i'm 5'9"" & my husband is 5'11"". plus, i couldn't beat the price...was looking at the same stroller at babies-r-us, in black - was $20 more. i'm totally sold on this stroller...color is great, my son is secure without being constricted (& it's cool b/c the back reclines slightly if he wants to take a quick nap) & it's at the right height to be comfortable to push. the only draw back is that it is a bit bulky when folded down, but it's a lot more compact than the travel stroller i was using before! i totally recommend this stroller, it's a great buy & i look forward to wearing it out."
3,My back....,"Love the look and feel of the stroller. I have the tangerine model.But oh my back... Im male, 5'10"" on a good day, and do most of the pushing when we are out and about. I cant stress enough that it isnt designed for someone of my height, which isnt all that tall. I have begun to prefer my larger mclaren techno just for my chiropractor's sake.On huge plus about the height is that my son, who is 2 1/2, can push it himself and see where hes going (w/o the canopy). thats definitely worth something."
3,A bit short,"I love how light and simple this stroller is, but the handles are too short. I am 5' 7"" and the handles are pretty short for me, but they are way short for my 6' 3"" man. We both kick the back wheels of the stroller when we walk. I'm really disappointed because I wanted a simple, easy stroller, but I think we're going to have to replace this one. Also, from the picture, the lime green looked more green, but when it arrived it's basically flourescent yellow. Ick."
1,not for 18+ mos old kids,"I was so excited when I ordered this stroller. I really liked it when I checked it out at the store. I couldn't wait for it to arrive after I placed my order here at Amazon.What's the problem??? The CROTCH STRAP! Too short for my 18mo old who is only 24lbs. She's at 50th percentile in height and weight. And this stroller is supposed to be for 37 lb kids?I was very disappointed. So, I sent it back to Amazon. I wish they would fix the strap because I'll be waiting to buy it."
1,New harness system is terrible- buckle digs into my baby's thighs,"I called Chicco because what I bought vs what I tested in the store was not the same product. Per Chicco, new regulations required that they move the crotch strap to the middle of the seat late 2009. The pictures you see online are NOT what it looks like now. Needless to say any normal size baby will end up sitting on the crotch strap, which is a problem but not the reason why I'm rating it 1 star. Because it's in the middle and the crotch strap is SHORT and NON-ADJUSTABLE, the plastic buckle digs into my 15 month thighs. Just note she's 50% weight and 50% height on the growth charts - not a big baby. I don't know if any baby over 9 months can comfortably sit in that stroller with the stap in the middle of the seat. Do not buy unless they change the harness system."
4,Satisfied,"We purchased this stroller for use as an umbrella stroller instead of buying the super cheap ones. We like the Chicco brand. It is very smooth and we like the added features of the sun shade and the goodie basket. I will agree with other users that sometimes my husband kicks the rear wheels and the strap between the child's legs should be longer. However this fits our needs perfectly. We wanted something small, compact, light for our 2 year old in malls and other brief trips. It is very compact and light weight. If you want a full on stroller that has an adjustable handles, cup holders, all terrain wheels I highly recommend the Chicco Cortina Travel System. We loved ours and still use it for the zoo or the fair."
2,Do not take on airplane!,Don't listen to the advice of the woman in the video for this stroller. This stroller is not durable enough to be checked at the gate of an airplane. I know from experience.... the handles broke off in transit and the frame bent. Note that most airlines will not cover cost of broken strollers. Its a check at your own risk. Maybe it was mishandled by the airline but there are better constructed strollers for airplane travel. Buyer Beware!
2,better value than $1 store strollers,"It's much stronger than any stroller from a dollar store but it's terrible anyway. My back hurts from bending because the handles are too short and they don't extend. I keep kicking the wheels and I am afraid I might trip if walking too fast (they are set apart rather narrowly). It is difficult too buckle up, the middle strap's (the one between legs) buckle is sitting way too low and I would add a remowable front bar to protect a child from falling out. Looking for a replacement and no, I do not recommend this product."
1,Short handles!,"Be prepared to kick the back wheels. I'm only 5'5"". Very disappointing. Also, you have to use your hand(s) to fold it."
4,a decent travel stroller,"we purchased this stroller because we had an international flight planned. the stroller is light, easily foldable and reclines.it has a canopy and a tiny basket. you can't store anything on the handles because the stroller is too light. I would buy it again. it does wit a travel bag but when we picked it up from the baggage claim, it had a whole in it..not very sturdy fabric I guess."
3,Just Okay,"I'm only 5'2"" and my feet continuously hit the wheels of this stroller. The handles are way too short. Its lightweight and looks comfortable. The basket is way too small to fit anything. It definitely needs a cup holder!! I would spend the extra money to get a higher end lightweight stroller."
3,Good light stroller.,"Overall it is good. Kid seems comfortable in it. I kick the wheels in a full stride. I don't think my wife does though. The basket is a bit hard to use, small gap to slide stuff in. Good construction and quality materials used."
3,Nice stroller,"This is nice to have as a ligthweight stroller for errands and quick trips. I wouldn't use it as my primary stroller because it barely reclines and also my major complaint would be that while you push it your feet touch the wheels (and not that I'm very tall, I'm 5'5) so I would suggest an adjustable handle in height. All in all, it's a good alternative to when we couldn't use the infant car seat anymore but needed something I could get around with easily with my toddler for errands. Topazio color is very nice."
4,Great stroller with just one complaint...,"Things I love about this stroller:1) folds up into a really manageable size, if a little long2) light and easy to carry3) the shade is actually useful! unlike so many umbrella strollers4) it looks fantastic5) the brakes are super easy to use and very useful (particularly when you have the stroller folded up and put the brakes on so you can lean the stroller up against a wall without it getting away)6) the storage area is big enough to be useful and you can throw a bunch of purses and stuff over the handle bars without it falling over7) it comes with a handy carrying strap, cover, and plastic pouch that clips on that I use to store the cover as well as other small itemsMy one complaint:When you push the stroller, your feet hit the wheels almost without fail. I have to walk as though on a straight line in order to prevent this, and I'm only 5'4"" so my legs really aren't that long!"
4,"nice stroller, but taller then expected","It's a nice and lightweight stroller, but when packed it is taller then the other one i have(chicco cortina travel system). But overall i enjoyed this stroller."
5,My little life saver,Just what I needed. Folds up umbrella style but reclines. No more bobbing baby head when they fall asleep. . I was at the mall with my 3 boys one year old in the stroller and my 8 and 9 year old walking beside. The canopy is amazing the baby had sun in his face and all I did was lower it on the metal bar and it shaded him to his belly. I am hanging up my umbrella stroller for good. I've been carrying it around on my back when I'm not using it and for me it's extremely light. Also when we stopped at the food court and I took the baby out my bags didn't make the stroller fall to the floor. Loooooooooooooove it!!!!!!
4,Like the stroller,"I love the stroller overall. The one issue that I have with it is that my feet hit the wheels as I push it. The stroller itself is great and my daughter loves it. She appears to be comfortable and happy. The arm length is quite nice and I don't have to stoop down, even though I am 6'1. I find that it is a great, lightweight, stroller and for the money this is a great buy."
2,Beware of the harness - crotch strap is very short,"My son is 18 months old and well within the weight limits for the stroller. However, we have to struggle a lot each time to buckle him in. Main reason is that the crotch strap is very short, making it very tight to put in. There is no way to extend that strap and I don't think I will be able to use this stroller for long.What a shame that a product, which otherwise is well made, has such a basic design flaw."
2,Too short!!,"I am 5'7 and the handles are too short for me. Also, when walking my feet always hit the stroller. The stroller doesn't offer much of an option for laying down. It is lightweight and cute but for the money I would go with something different."
2,Not my favorite!,I was looking for an umbrella stroller a little nicer than the usual 20$ ones but didn't want an expensive one either. So I chose this and after using it for a couple weeks I wish I had chosen something different. My husband complains about the fact that the handles aren't tall enough so it doesn't keep the stroller far enough away from him so he is constantly kicking the wheels. I am only 5'7 and I kick the wheels when I am walking behind it to! Its so frustrating! And as far as getting it to fold down...you either have to use your shoe (which is gonna end up being messed up) and use your hand (which you're gonna end up pinching your finger) because its a pretty tough clasp! It is however lightweight and doesn't take up a whole lot of room but I just would have rather spent a little bit more money and gotten one I want to use after all my child is gonna be riding in this awhile!!!
4,Excellent Lightweight Stroller,"My only complaint about this stroller is that there is no cup holder. Otherwise, easy to use, light (compared to my Graco Mosaic stroller, it's over a 10-15 pound difference) and the color rocks. My daughter seems comfortable and naps just fine in it. The straps are also easier to use than the Mosaic stroller. Steering is so easy!"
3,A saver in an airport setting,"If you are going to travel by air, I would highly recommend this stroller. It is lightweight, convenient and easy to pack at the last minute before boarding a plane. However if you are considering this as an everyday stroller, I would be a little more reluctant in my recommendation. The handles do not extend out far enough from the wheels so you constantly bang your feet against the back wheels as you push the stroller. You can push the stroller hunched over or with your arms fully extended but that's only comfortable for so long. I am only 5'10"" and my wife 5'6"" and we both have this problem. Someone smaller would probably not have to worry about this but taller people will probably be annoyed by this even more than us. Other than that it's a sturdy stroller for an umbrella stroller and can even handle some off-road action if necessary. It really was useful for us on vacation and especially while rushing to catch connecting flights in huge international airports."
2,Lightweight But Not Comfortable,"This stroller is lightweight, but it hurts my back. I either kick the wheels or lean forward and hurt my back. It is something about the placement of the handles, because I'm only 5'5"" so I'm not very tall. The underseat storage compartment is deceivingly small as well. I would not recommend this stroller."
2,Baby Planner Review,"I have been using this stroller for a year as a full time nanny/baby planner, and I have never liked it. Here's why:- Short handles: I'm 5' 7"" and I hate hunching over this thing.- Short seat: He was too tall for this stroller before turning two! And since the minimum age is 6mo, we got 1.5 years out of it. That's pathetic for a stroller- Skinny seat: no winter coats here - especially after baby turns one.- Small, practically inaccessible basket: hard to get to, and holds very littleI could go on..."
1,Really Didn't Like This Stroller,"I picked this stroller because it was sturdy and I liked the print- I had the light green one with polka dots- but I almost immediately regretted the purchase. I am not tall- just over 5'5""- and I kicked the wheels with almost every step unless I thought about it consciously and walked different. It drove me crazy. I just sold it on craigslist and am trying to find a Maclaren. The price is much more attractive than a Maclaren, but pushing it was so annoying that I had to get rid of it."
1,Buying this stroller could be tragic,"DON'T BUY THIS STROLLER if you are over 5'2 inches !! Maybe this a great stroller... but earlier today it gave me the scare of my life !!!When you are walking, if you are too tall (I am 5'5)your feet bump the wheels of the stroller. It doesn't seem like a huge problem until the wheels make you trip up and fall....which happened to me today. I watched in horror as I fell, the stroller kept moving toward the street going over the curb. Thank god it stopped right at the edge of the road and we live on a pretty quiet street. It's just not worth the chance you might take by buying this.It might be great if you are shorter but as for me...I will never, ever use it again."
2,Poor customer service,"The stroller itself is decent for the price. It rides smoothly and has a 5 pt harness. However, it's virtually impossible to steer with one hand. We've had the stroller for 3 yrs with minimal use. The rubber footrest just broke and customer service said it cannot be replaced since it is riveted on--poorly designed."
4,"Love, Love, Love it!","I absolutely HATE big, bulky strollers...even for newborns. As if new moms don't have enough to carry around?! I needed something more lightweight & practical. I love this umbrella stroller. It is soooo lightweight, but very sturdy and well-made. The colors are very cute (I got Topazio). The handles are tall, which makes it perfect for taller folks I would imagine, since I'm short. I had to have the 5-point restraint because I wanted to use the stroller for my newborn. I bought a newborn head support for carseats & attached it to the restraint system. My newborn now sleeps cozy in the stroller & I don't have to worry about him flopping around. He's nice & secure! There are a few cons: the bottom basket is very small and there is no cup holder. Still not enough for a bad rating!"
4,Wonderful stroller,"This is a very nice stroller - light (I can hold my child and take the stroller out of the car and unfold it, at the same time); roomy, does not look or feel like a toy, as many umbrella strollers do. I wanted the canopy to cover the back and not to be loose, so the sun always gets to the child, and this one does that. The material looks durable, the 5-point harness is also a nice feature.I give it 4 stars, because when folded the front wheels touch the canopy and make it dirty. The lack of a cup holder is also not very convenient, although not a great minus in my opinion. The back wheels get a little close to your feet, so you might kick them while walking - also not a great issue in my opinion.Out of the lightweight strollers out there, this one is definitely high quality and a decent price. The price on Amazon is $[...] less that the regular retail, which is another plus."
1,Don't Buy,"I own an aluminum ramp already of good quality but wanted a wider ramp for easier loading. This ramp is flimsey and provides no traction to power the bike up. I tried to load my 400 pound bike but bought the ramp intending to load my 600 pound bike with it. No matter what, it was impossible to load the 400 pound bike into the bed of my 4wd truck. I'm back to using my narrow ramp and this ramp went into the scrap pile."
1,big mistake.,the arms do not stay in at all. you basically just have to move the figure a little for them both to fall out. its impossible for the figure it hold any of its weapons. with out a doubt the worst gundam product i've ever purchased.
2,Muddled soup,"Calder gets points for picking an interesting array of subjects for his biography, but his approach to each individual is somewhat confusing in the best of the entries. I found myself having to go back in many instances to follow the trail of breadcrumbs Calder left: names and events appear before we've been properly introduced (giving me the impression Calder had talked about them previously and I should already know who/what he is talking about -- which was not always the case)."
1,it broke!,"my hot water bottle and I were happy together for about 2 years. I never used the massage feature, but it didn't get in the way much.Then, last night, it just split! In my bed! In the middle of the night! Let me tell you, you haven't lived until you have to scram out of bed because very hot water is pouring all over you, then have to spend half the night disassembling various feather beds and mattress toppers (what can I say, I like my bed comfy), pulling off sheets and duvets, and trying to figure out how to sleep in soaking wet bed.This water bottles only function in life was to hold hot water INSIDE, and it failed miserably..."
4,THE DEFINITIVE MISERERE AT LAST!,"THERE ARE SOME GREAT THINGS IN THIS TROVATORE THAT I LOVE - LEVINE'S CONDUCTING IS OUTSTANDING. DOLORA ZAJICK IS SUPERB AS AZUCENA! APRILE MILLO REMINDS US OF RENATA TEBALDI - HER VOICE HERE IS SPETACULAR AND SUBLIME, SPECIAL MENTION TO HER MISERERE. BY THE WAY, I WAS SO SATISFIED WITH THE MEASURE GIVEN IN THIS PIECE BY LEVINE, HE HAS GOT A MIRACLE OF TRANSMITING A MEDIEVAL SOUND SUNG BY THE CHOIR - FANTASTIC! THIS IS THE MISERERE I HAVE ALWAYS DREAMT TO LISTEN!"
3,Not so fast...,"I've read all the fine reviews of this CD and here's another opinion. The CD has no lack of emotion but the delivery lacks energy. What I've liked best about this wonderful singer/sonwriter is that her previous CDs gave me upbeat, pleasant songs as well as the introspective ballads that helped to make her so attractive to such a wide audience. She's hard to place in to one catagory and that's what makes her special. Having said all those nice things, the fact is this CD lacks an enthusiasm, diversity and energy to give it the kind of rating several other of her CDs have justifiable earned. While the songs are ""nice"", the flow is slow. Songs above a slow crawl are few and far between. There's no sense in reviewing each tune, as all have merit. This CD is just not magical, as others have been. I'm thankful for this new product but personally disappointed that it didn't exceed the work Mary has done in the past."
5,An album with soul,"To really appreciate MCC music, and especially Between Here and Gone, you have to listen to it. Not just hear it... listen. I purchased this CD without listening to a single track and am in no way disappointed. This album especially speaks to those who listen to music with their hearts. It has soul."
4,Great! From MCC's biggest fan since 1991,"I started to listen to MCC back in the early 90s and have always loved her music. True that her last few albums haven't been the radio friendliest but they were still good. Her music, voice and class to country music has always been welcome. I mean, the first time I heard Passionate Kisses, I couldn't get enough!This album is a bit of a departure. There aren't many faster songs and mostly just nice relaxed music that you will love just to listen and sing along with. That is true with ""What would You say to me"". And, one of my favorites (and faster song) is Beautiful Racket. MCC's music has always been fun and this album is no exception. She's a wonderful person in all ways. We love her!"
5,love this collection of songs!,"Usually I buy a CD when there's a song or two that I really like...there are at least five that I LOVE on ""Between Here & Gone,"" and every track is good. Love her voice, and her lyrics are so thoughtful and moving. Great CD!"
1,Boo Hoo,"I have all MCC's CD's and have loved many things about all of them until this one....cheer up Mary, PLEASE, you're depressing the crud out of me. Only one good up tempo song, nothing catchy, nothing fun just a bunch of introspective dirge-like monotony. I skip over songs like the ones on this CD when I play her others. I really don't care for subtle (or not) politics when I listen to music."
4,Pool Test Kit,"I ordered this test kit because I had finally purchased my first pool. It is a great test kit, but I think the directions could have been a little more simplified."
5,Great price!,"This is a very basic kit for maintaining pool PH levels. It is extremely reliable and easy to use. But my strongest recommendation is that by purchasing this product from Amazon, I saved money and had it arrive really fast. That's the bottom line."
4,Nice complete set!,Looking for an affordable kit to maintain an above ground pool so we went with this. It is exactly as described and provides the ability to test all levels but the instructions seemed almost cumbersome at times. Accurate readings and easy to handle but no where to store all the bottles etc unless you like to keep plastic packaging :/ Overall a good prodcut for the money.
1,The test result is not accurate,I got this Kem-Tek 450 5-Way Pool Test Kit a few weeks ago. The color code with the first test shows the CH reading is above 5-10 which is way above the normal result. I tested the water again today and got same result. I took the water sample for professional water test. Both CH and Ph are good. I am not sure if the test kit chemistry already expired when I receive it a few weeks ago as no expiration date marked on the small bottles.
1,Worthless,"I followed the instructions to the letter, and found out that I get the same colors all the time and these colors never change. The results just does not mean anything !!!It is not even worth to return it, gone to the trash."
4,gets the job done.,this kit gets the job done at a very reasonable price. no case but for this price who cares?
1,Labels must be misprinted,"The Alkalinity and pH colors are not correct. If you look at any other brand, you will see that the Alkalinity colors are the green tint and the pH is the orange tint. My bottle obviously has a misprinted label because the colors are opposite. This obviously doesn't give you an accurate reading and if trying to fix the ""problem"" yourself then you are fixing the wrong problem. I was getting ready to treat my water for low pH and high Alk, but had my water tested at my pool center. Well....after their test I actually needed to treat low Alk and high pH. I'm sure there are others with the same mislabeled bottle, so heads-up!"
1,Colors show that aren't on the chart,"We have colors showing up that aren't on the chart. As well, searching online to learn how to diagnose this dilemma is futile. The company has not website and doesn't offer how to rectify balancing the water with unusual colors. I won't purchase this product again and am stuck with a new bottle of these things."
3,Accurate Testing,"This test kit provides accurate testing, however the color bar, came loose on the chlorine side and got lost, luckily it is just shades of yellow and you can pretty much just guess if it is good or bad. :)"
3,Colors don't match reference chart that well,"These strips are OK. The tint of the total alkalinity isn't quite the same as the reference on the label, so it's hard to tell exactly what the reading is. Also, the pH reading seems to constantly drift a little over the first 60 seconds, so that reading can be hard to judge. The chlorine works well, but I think next year I'm going to switch back to Aquachek strips."
2,A bit misleading,"Since these were called ""4-Way"" test strips, I assumed the following FOUR items were tested:pHFree chlorineTotal alkalinityCyanuric acidActually, this only tests THREE things. Cyanuric acid is NOT included:pHChlorine/BromineTotal alkalinityThis was partially my fault because I didn't thoroughly read the product details AND I was relying on my memory of my AquaCheck bottle. However, I still feel the name is misleading because ""Chlorine/Bromine"" is ONE line item, not two (therefore making this a THREE way test in my mind!). In addition, I would like to know my cyanuric acid level."
3,Functional but cheaply made,"The Kem-Tek 450 pool test kit contains all the reagents needed for basic pool/spa maintenance. This is not rocket science, and the product does work. But the kit is very poorly made -- the chemicals leaked in the packaging and the caps do not fit tightly on the test vessel, so the (colored) water leaks out when you tip to mix. It also has no box to hold the reagents, vessel and instructions, so you end up tossing everything in a plastic bag. Should have paid a little more to get a decent quality product."
1,Do not purchase,"I have never written a review before, however I felt an obligation to forewarn people on this one. This product does not do what it is supposed to. The color indicators do not work. I have followed the directions, adjusted the pool with chemicals, and this product indicates that nothing has changed. I also use an electronic device with test strips which does indicates the changes. I was trying to use both products just to be sure. This product does not work. Do not waste your money on it."
2,Only a 2 way test kit,"This kit seems to work great for testing chlorine and pH. Testing for alkalinity is impossible. The instructions do not make sense, literally. The logic in the alkalinity test is broken--it can't work following the steps provided in the instructions.The instructions appear to have been translated from to english. Someone really goofed on the alkalinity section."
1,Not satisfied at all,"When i received the chemicals in the mail, all the different dies were mixed together..... Cant use them, each chemical die is for a different purpose. I was not happy when i opened package"
5,Sensitive read-aloud book,"We used this book as spring board for our 2nd grade class Quaker meeting focusing on kindness and times when we've found that what matters is what's in the heart, not on the outside. All of us-- kids and teachers-- were moved to tears and the kids' responses were incredible. Well done book. Lots of applications. Luminous illustrations."
2,Bizarre.,"The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because I liked the general idea of the plot - young boy, getting picked on, finding one friend, etc. What ruins it for me though is two things: 1) Everyone once in awhile, the dialogue makes you wince, and 2) The illustrations scared the crap out of me. After I'd read it, I thought it would have been an awesome story had the dialogue been better and illustrations not be so... dark, moody, creepy."
1,The title says it all.,"The title says it all- be good to Eddie Lee, after all he has Down Syndrome. Talk about condescending! I agree with others here who have commented on the stereotypes that rule this book; Eddie is depicted as exceptionally gentle, sensitive and emotional. He is labelled, ""lonesome"", ""different"", ""dummy"" and my personal favourite, God's ""mistake"". The pictures are absolutely beautiful but the book is absolutely dreadful."
1,Poor Eddie Lee!,"Although many seem to think that this is a delightful book, it is full of stereotyped information about people with Down syndrome that is outdated and offensive. Portraying Eddie as not caring that the children make fun of him, gives readers the idea that people with Down syndrome aren't bright enough to know when they are being made fun of. Always happy, always laughing--certainly not the real picture of people who have feelings, hopes and dreams just like you and I do. The illustrations, although lovely, exaggerate the physical characteristics some people with Down syndrome have in common. Instead of pointing out that people are more alike than different, this book points out differences. If you are looking for a book to educate readers about disability issues or Down syndrome, there are many better choices."
2,Jack defective,"I purchased 2 of these to adapt my banana plug output amp to regular (not TRS) 1/4 speaker cables. I found that if I plug the cable all the way into the 1/4"" jacks, they don't make contact. I have to pull them out a little and then they make contact. It's a pain, and not a reliable way to operate. I disassembled the jack to see if it was miswired, it didn't seem to be. The issue appears to be with the jack itself. They both have the same issue, so it wasn't a fluke.My solution will be to hack the cables together now, but that's unfortunate, since I spent REAL MONEY on these adapters so I wouldn't have to do that.I haven't tried the Pyle version of this pigtail, which is actually a few $ cheaper, but I wish I had bought those instead."
4,Wonderful Recording,"Bought this CD quite a while ago. Unlike most music purchases, I keep going back to this CD. More of a ""pop"" than a ""jazz"" guy, I sometimes wonder why contemporary artists approach standards when they have nothing new to bring to the table, e.g., Michael Buble's ""I've Got You Under My Skin"", which seems (to my ears) like high level karaoke. Sinatra's ""In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning"" is another title better left alone, or so I thought, until listening to Kurt Elling's version. Coupled with Keith Jarrett's ""Leaving Again"", it's hypnotically beautiful - as much on the 30th listening as on the first. Ellington's ""I Like the Sunrise"" also deserves praise. Hope both tracks are included in Elling's Sinatra program at Philadelphia's Annenberg Center this coming spring."
2,"NIce, but too nice","I bought this CD on impulse. Kurt sang on radio one day as I was driving down a busy street and he did something with his voice that caught my ear and I thought: Mmm, nice. It was nice and the entire play list is nice, but it's too nice, safe and, ultimately, for my ears, boring. I thought Kurt might experiment a bit more, float a bit more, extend, go out on a limb, twist, turn, play, but he stayed safe. I own it now. I've played it now. I will give it away now."
2,Too much crooning!,"As a long-time fan of Kurt, I was hoping this album would continue his tradition of walking the innovative ""tightrope"" that defines the tradition of vocalese as pioneered by Eddie Jefferson, Jon Hendricks, and Mark Murphy. Instead I heard an entire album of moody crooning derived from his concerts dedicated to Johnny Hartman. I believe this album was recorded in an attempt to widen his commercial appeal - in that regard it appears to have succeeded. However, this was accomplished at the expense of abandoning the cutting-edge style of vocal jazz that brought him initial acclaim in Chicago. Hopefully, Kurt will come to his senses and return to the dynamic vocalese that played to packed crowds at the Green Mill."
5,This works and fits well on my 80's keyboard!,I got this for my 80's Roland Alpha Juno 1 keyboard and now it works and powers on!I'm happy and it's cheap.I would recommend this product to anyone with a vintage keyboard that fits this Hosa 2 wire cable.
5,it works,"it works good buy i like it and it worked what i needed it for, would recommend it to somebody else"
1,no fit,"Not sure why, but power plugs will not fit into this cable. It's too small. It turned out to be useless."
2,Not feeling this one...,"I love Blaze's flow when he is collaborating, but I'm not digging much of his solo work. He has the perfect hip hop vocals but his beats need some serious work. He should take a listen to Prozak, Project Deadman, Tech N9ne and Boondox. Toe Tagz is the only good song on this album as far as I'm concerned and has a pretty bad ass beat to it too!!"
4,The Hatch that runs under the street,I have Blazes first album and this one..I really like the first album..I just wish that he would do morfe trake by him self..The first album it was more like Blaze and ABK and everyone else..Same thing again everyone is on the album again..He needs to do more tracks on his own..
5,"""Arid"" Al is happy!!","Years ago I started listening to Infotainment Scan with headphones at work. I sat behind my computer doing CAD design, with this album pumping through the phones. It became a solid favorite album from the Fall, if not an all time favorite. I infected others with this record, and when they lost thier copies they found it out of print.It's swell that this new version exists. It sounds excellent, at the moment I can't fault anything in the sound. And extra tracks can be fun. This is easily my fave Fall album period. (and I have most of them) Okay, real fookfaces prefer Hex or Perverted, but this is the one for me. Grab it while it exists."
4,This is primetime B-movie entertainment,"Great cast, giant killer rabbits, and the dvd looks great for a 30+ year old low budget movie.Stop whining about the special effects, because that really makes you film student types look silly. Go watch a Meryl Streep movie or something."
2,"Spectacular! Well, no...","One of the true great classics of the 'B' Movie range (well, maybe 'C'), ""Night of the Lepus"" is one of my favorite bad movies. I think my uncle's train set had better miniature models than this movie, but it doesn't matter: when you see the giant killer bunnies coming over the fences, you forget all about them. I loved it and I can hardly wait for the DVD."
4,Inept but good....,"Great cast,but this is something they should not be proud to be in.Sometimes the rabbits look gigantic,but other times they look like the size of a deer..This movie would be perfect for MST3K...Bad effects(if you call them that),dumb scientists make for a truly great bad movie!! Finally out on dvd-about time!!"
5,night of the lepus,this is the worst movie that actually made some effort to be good I've seen. I love it! Buy the DVD used today.
2,Lepus....That's Latin for rabbit.....,"So what's Latin for tripe? This is the sort of low-rent cheapie you'd see on TV late at night before cable came along and ruined everything. Features a post-Psycho Janet Leigh and a post-Star Trek Deforest Kelley (plus moustache and puffy sideburns), and some really bad special effects. Too boring to be a good bad flick, but still has 2 stars worth of cheesy entertainment in my book.SPECIAL FEATURES:Theatrical TrailerChapter Index"
4,Bunnies on a Plane,"OK, so thay are on a ranch, not a plane, but the concept is the same. Great movie to make fun of while watching! I thought it was soooooo cooool, when I was 10. I gotta get this just to say I have it!!!"
3,"""There's a young couple here from the East...""","Who turn out to be Stuart Whitman and Janet Leigh, both around 45 and showing it. But that wasn't the first instance of mind-numbing dopiness even though it occurred in the first five minutes. Rory Calhoun had already shot his horse when it broke its leg after stepping in a rabbit hole. That wasn't so odd, but the rabbits were just standing there snoofling around while this all happened. Except in stock footage of old rabbit roundups, ALL the rabbits in this movie were tame. Everyone just picks them up!Oh well. As the other reviewers noted, it's so awful you cannot take your eyes off it. Bunnies in slow motion with thick red stuff all over their cute bunny noses are a definite must-see."
5,Great Movie,Great movie. What is not to like about Mutated man eating town destroying bunny rabbits? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.It is terrible. The acting is hilarious. Blaming small children for destroying the world. Night of the Lepus is hands down my favorite movie ever. It's appallingly wonderful.
3,Night of the Lepus,"You must be a fan of the old , cornball scifi , but if you are, you'll have a grand time : early days of ""eco-science"" where reality takes a back seat . You'll laugh and thrill at the same time . Pretty good ""stuff"" considering the age it was done ."
3,Rory Calhoun: Wabbit Killer,"Without question, the best giant killer rabbit movie DeForest Kelley ever made. ""Look at them, standing on their hind legs, like a bunch of Rory Calhouns!"" Very much in the ""so bad, its good"" category."
4,When Bunnies Attack,"I watched this on a whim and honestly was laughing out loud for much of it. Its campy and corny and the dialog is REALLY bad. All these together make this a really great movie. Watch it if you enjoy classic camp.One note, Lepus is the Latin genus for Hares NOT common domestic (European) rabbits like shown in the move. I guess Night of the Leporidae would have been an equally ridiculous title, but would have been more fitting."
4,Essence,"Dr. Bolander has a winner! I felt as if I was right next to the patient in the emergency room as he describes the sounds, sights and even the smells. This is a fast paced book with a great story line that keeps you reading as the characters flee their enemys. Essence would make a great movie!"
4,Love this little deck!,I recently bought this deck two months ago and love it! I love doing readings for others and for myself with this deck. I also enjoy the spells. Which are simple and easy to follow! I have several decks and this is one of my personal favorites!
3,"Fun, if a bit silly","This is a nice lighthearted break from serious oracle & tarot decks. But once you've used it a few times, it will probably go onto the shelf."
2,Extremely disappointing!,"Based on other reviews for the book and the author in general, I chose this book to start learning Java.Plusses: well-written, clear, good examples.Minus: does not cover at all creating windows (AWT, Swing), graphics, and layout.Why the poor rating? Without at least an introduction to these topics, you can only write a program with ""1970s mainframe style"" output: lines of text on a command screen. You cannot write a program with any user input (buttons, text boxes, mouse clicks). Forget about any graphics whatsoever.These topics are not wildly advanced. I am finding them covered in Sun's introductory documentation -- but unfortunately that is not as clear and well-written as Schildt's books.500 pages, and at the end still not possible to create a simple GUI application :-("
2,clear as mud,"Is the author writing these good reviews? Personally, I think this book is about as clear as mud. So far I've read up through ch 7 for a class and can honestly say that I would not be able to produce even a simple program worthy of distribution. No gui or graphics, all text prompts. If this book is a true representation of Java then I'm sticking with Visual Basic."
2,Not so great,"It was OK, but I wasn't overly impressed with it. I would not buy it again and the only reason I bought it in the first place was because it was a required text book."
4,Dog Soldier - A hero among hero's.,"Dog Soldier is a well-written historical novel. Based on sound facts the story takes readers on a journey that is both perilous and heart-warming. Jumper, the canine soldier was an important member of the 109th Engineers, boosting moral and warning of danger among the soldiers he adored. Jumper and his companions give insight into the reality of war and yet it is appropriate for all ages. I believe this would make an excellent scholastic addition to the classroom. Teachers could read to or along with students and have a lively discussion with students from 4th grade through high school. Written through the eyes of the canine hero seems to make it all the more amusing and moving while teaching an important lesson of remembrance as we honor all soldiers."
3,The task is too difficult. . .,"Ultimately, the task of expressing the way of Tibetan Mahayana in terms that are derived from Western Philosophy is one that's bound to lead to failure. In fact, a good book for the western reader would be one that approaches the nature of that failure and introduces language and 'concepts' to deal with a reality that is meta-linguistic and anti-conceptual.From my limited understanding of the original material (I've only read in translation) it seems that Guenther has done a sensitive and sensible job. The text remains extremely difficult and the 'problems in translation' to which he alludes are barely dealt with.However, this is a good start, a reading that may loosen a few cords and enable the student to get a bit closer.Lynn Hoffman, author of bang BANG"
4,Kingston Memory RAM,Great RAM product - got it right away in 2 - 3 days shipping and it works great in my laptop
1,Do NOT buy a Dell,"Dell computer is the worst computer company I ever had to deal with. Their customer service is horrible and will leave you willing to pay for a local computer technician even if your computer is still under warranty. My first laptop was an Inspiron 8600, and in the 5 years I have owned it, it has crashed 4 times for which I needed to pay a technician to restore it. I have since bought two other Dell computers. They both have had problems within a year of ownership, and when I attempted to contact customer service they were rude and offered no help with my problem.Dell has been a huge waste of my money and time and I will never buy another Dell item."
1,Ive never had anything worse.,"The first one I got had a problem with the keys, and a different character would appear on screen than the key that was pressed, on the very first day. A replacement arrived by mail a few weeks later, and it started giving me trouble by the end of the first week. A blue error screen would not allow me to log on into Windows. After 4 months of wait, they finaly sent me a replacement hard drive, and 3 months after that, the blue screen started appearing again. Overall, the WORST investment of my life. Avoid!"
2,Nice Machine... If its working.,"Watch out for Dells customer service. Its really the worst. I have spent 6 phone calls, and about 4.5 hours on the phone with them, still not resolving my issue. After being promised to be called back multiple times, due to the time issue, still no calls. They have sent the wrong part to me 3 times (dont ask me how) All I wish is that I bought the HP or Sony. I dont know how Dell has gotten so big, with the poor quality, and poorer customer service."
1,dell laptops,"Purchasing any dell product is worst mistake in your life. I bought dell Inspiron 6000, and had to call countless times during past 3 years. After 3 years I had to pay 390 $ for hardware warranty support, because I knew it would spoil as usual.Each call to customer support takes very long time and its waste of time and money.The dell technical support, customer support is worst. If you are thinking of laptops purchase any laptops other than dell, because I am having worst experience with dell laptop and don't want this laptop even for my enemy."
4,"Its not Dell, its You.","Dell laptops are not as evil as the 3 lower comments make them seem. It takes some basic user knowledge to get accustomed with the product. There is no need to 'knock' Dell down because of a bad user experience.Blue screens are usually caused by bad programming or writing of software. Blue screens have codes that say ""error: xxx"" where XXX is the name and code of the problem. MOST bluescreens are MEMORY PARITY problems -- bad programming of software.Dell not responding to customer issues is absurd. I have never had that experience in the 15 years I've been contacting Dell for any situation.My suggestion to people who have ""so much trouble"" is to figure out why others do not. You may not realize that installing and uninstalling through the Windows installer is the proper way to install. Installing through each individual programs installer is WRONG. This advice will fix 9% of problems out there dealing with ""my laptop is slow now!"""
3,Small gag!,"When I got this, I expected it to be bigger. I put it in my mouth to see how big it was and laughed, my boyfriend jokingly said ""it doesn't block out much sound, does it?"" and it really doesn't. I haven't FULLY tested it out, yet, but I'm sure I'll be disappointed."
1,One Of The Worst...,"This is truely one of the worst Cd's I have ever listened too. Sure it's great that he is gay and actually singing about being gay rahter than closeting himself, but that does not make for a great CD. The songs are generic and bland with no beat whatsoever, his voice is weak and emotionless, and the lyrics are chessy silliness. The hooks themselves don't even exsist. Once I got to the train wreck that was He's On My Team, (a lame version of The Boy Is Mine by Brandy and Monica), I knew there was no hope. Stay away from this CD at all costs. Not even one song was ok to listen too. I hope he gets better material next time because I do want to be a fan of his, but this is trash.Key Tracks: NONE"
2,No Banjo Ethos,"Chock-full of Irish/Celtic tunes for the banjo. However, nearly all the songs are extremely advanced, and about a third of the book consists of unilluminating and supercilious essays on music theory. Not how you'd imagine a banjo book."
3,Above the heads of the little ones,"I bought this book as part of a Christian pre-school character education program - this book is included in the ""courage"" theme. The story is a bit over the head of my pre-school audience, but the illustrations are wonderful."
4,One of the best inventions in the drill industry,"This flip countersink is a must have for the efficient carpenter. I don't remember them having so much play(in the retainer bearing) in the past, but that is a small issue. Assembled in the U.S.A. and a great value bought like this on it's own, and hard to find these days in the retail stores. Thanks Amazon!......."
3,"World's most expensive ""Banana"" Plugs!!!!",I'm in the market for a good quality pair of banana plugs. I love this classic design which makes it simple to pop it right into your amplifier speaker terminals. Not sure if it's worth the list price of $569.95 for something so cheap-looking. To each his own I suppose. At least the retailer is kind enough to offer this with a huge 98% discount with Amazon Prime eligibility. 5 Stars for the classic design + 1 star for the price = 3 star average. And I thought Monster Cable was expensive! Better get your HOSA accessories at a fire sale price while you can.
4,Okkervil keep getting better,"For Okkervil River fans, this is a must buy. The title Sleep & Wake-Up Songs is very suiting for the album. The album opens with ""A Favor"" which is an instant Okkervil River classic. The album then slows down, but picks up again on the closing track ""No Hidden Track"". The contrast between ""sleepy"" songs and ""wake-up"" songs is perfect for an EP. Rarely will I buy an EP, but I can't imagine this album being any longer or shorter. Will Sheff continues to improve his songwriting yet still keeping Okkervil Rivers' distinct sound. Again, this is a must buy for Okkervil River fans. For those who don't know Okkervil River, I suggest checking out Down the River of Golden Dreams or Don't Fall In Love With Everyone You See."
5,The unique verdian soprano voice,"Aprile Millo is the greatest soprano of these days. Many people thinks she is over, but does not correct. Just listen her singing Maddalena (Andrea Chenier - Metropolitan Season 92/93). Few words: the great voice at her best. Full of power, energy and sharing with the audience her energy. She is the best Luis Miller and the best performer on this recording. Just the last track of the opera takes full value. Enjoy it!"
2,"So, so book, kind of old information","This book was published in the 80s, then re-published in the 95. Most of the information is kind of old. It does not have pictures for most of the fish listed.Another thing I don't like is the lack of common names for the fish. It is one thing to have the proper name, it is another that a big portion of them missing common names. I would say about 60% of the fish listed don't have common names.I would not spend more than $10 for the book, considering what you get out of it."
5,Easy and informative,"Great way to read up on technology related stories. Kindle lets you download it directly and keeps a few days worth of articles (between 4 and 6) on the kindle, so you can have a chance to catch up if you fall behind."
2,fairy tales,its unreal reads like a stories made up by the officers but I may be wrong the storieswere not interesting
4,Body Lotion that silkens my skin,"I love Victoria's Secret, who doesn't? They have the best scents ever, and they have a lot of them. I purchased this lotion and love it. It has a great scent, I bought the Strawberry one. It makes my skin soft and silk.It also doesn't leave any irritation and smells heavenly."
4,Watch those expiration dates!,"I think the product is great, but the last bottle was dated to expire before I could finish it. No one likes to waste."
5,A must-read for high school thinkers and beyond,"I got this book for my son, looking for an intelligent book with substance to it, but also something that he, as a 14 year-old, would enjoy. He never put it down--nor did I, when I read it after he did. I'd rank it right up there with Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies, Chocolate Wars and other high school classics."
4,twists & turns- why to read this book!,"I read this book and absolutely fell in love with it! It is one of those novels that forces you to believe one thing, and all of a sudden, something else happens. Absolutely mysterious and written beautifully... very passionate."
2,eh,"I didn't like this book all that well. The beginning was ok, and the storyline got better towards the middle of the book. The ending, however, was hard to follow and didn't flow with the rest of the book. It's like the author didn't take very much time to think of an ending, and was tired of writing the book."
2,Where has the real Linda Howard gone?,"I remember when Linda Howard's name on a book guaranteed quality - Dream Man, Shades of Twilight and Son of the Morning are 3 of my all time favorite books. I've read them over and over. Then came Kill and Tell and Now You See Her which seemed written on auto-pilot with the reader (and I fear the author)developing no connection to shallowly written characters as opposed to the emotional ties you felt to her characters in the past. I'd hoped things would turn around, but All The Queen's Men is yet another let-down in my opinion. I found it marginally better than Kill and Tell and Now You See Her but still a far cry from her earlier works. I miss knowing a Linda Howard book will be a keeper, and don't plan on buying any more of her work until somebody tells me she's gone back to her old standards of quality writing."
1,A big disappointment.,"The author Linda Howard who once described herself as ""easily bored with murder, mayhem and politics"" has proven herself to be most interested in exactly that- for the third book in a row. I recognize any creators right to evolve and change view but I had always been able to count on this author for a truly rich romance story and the ultimate in alpha male characters-not anymore. After reading the words ""scatter-burst transmission"" for about the fourth time I asked myself what the heroe of the story physically looked like-I could not remember. The bits of information she relays about spec-war technology and techniques are very interesting but the characters are flat, the plot half-hearted and the romance virtually non-existent. In hindsight I would not have purchased (or read) this book in paperback- I will not be purchasing another one of Linda Howard's books."
2,"Not worth the price of a paperback, let alone hardback!","This book is boring! And, after buying both Ms. Howard's last books in hardback, I can tell you it WON'T happen again! Her last book, Now You See Her was stupid, with it's hurried-up ending, and dragged out sensuality. This one is just plain boring. Where was the romance? Pray tell me, what was the mystery, that made this a romantic supsense? And why bother with those stupid love scenes? They were just thrown in to add spice. This is definitely an author who's talents are depleting with each book. Read her old ones for the first time, or reread them! Skip her last two books!"
2,"Lite & Breezy, Dumb & Cheesy","I was in-between books and a coworker of mine recommended this one. I love trashy novels (like Jackie Collins' books!) and was told this book was fast and trashy. Well, it just didn't do it for me. It is very fast paced but the story was just too ludicrous and formulaic without any surprises- Smart, beautiful woman gets involved with espionage and romance while all the men fall at her feet (of course). The characters were too wooden to find engrossing and the plot wasn't nearly trashy enough to keep me interested either. (By the time there's finally a fairly raunchy sex scene you're almost through with the book and then the sex scene isn't all that great anyway.) This is really a pretty short book but I found it so boring that it took me about a month to read."
5,Could we please make that 6 stars?,"Linda Howard has advanced from the pure romance category to the mystery-suspense category with great sex thrown in. I'm not complaining. We have a great alpha type hero AND a heroine who can take care of herself. She's resourceful, competent, logical, and she manages to take of him. Ms. Howard must have great fantasies and thanks to her, I am too."
5,Lots more fun than just pure romance.,"I don't understand the complaints about Ms. Howard writing suspenseful romance. This book was great. My only complaint is that I almost preferred Ronsard to Medina. How about his story (and Eric Govert's)? I've been reading Ms. Howard's books for quite a while - how about finally giving us Chance McKenzie's story, too?"
4,One of the best from this author,"This book is a followup (not a true sequel, however) to Kill and Tell, which I thoroughly enjoyed. You don't have to read Kill and Tell in order to follow the flow of this book. But, K&T introduces the main character of this book, John Medina. I loved the characters in this book. Naima is gutsy but not to the point of emasculation. John is a man's man to the nth degree, but lets his guard down for Naima. But, he doesn't become some poor love smitten sap in the process, which I love. Story flows well, with good action sequences. As some have said, the love scenes are well crafted. Actually, Howard does love scenes with such great finesse, I think her books are worth picking up for that reason alone! I too was a little put off by the ending. I suppose I was expecting something more romantic. But, I suppose the actions suited these particular characters. When it comes to romantic suspense, Linda Howar is one of the best and this book is another example of that."
3,Ms Howard's new book misses the mark,"As a huge fan of Linda Howard, I have been very disapointed in her recent works. This new book is so much better than Now You See Her, but still fails to deliver the old Howard charm. I long for the day that Ms. Howard returns to the writing style that made me love her."
4,My opinion of this book,"Firstly i'd like to say Linda Howard is my absoloute favourite author and i get extremely excited whenever she writes a new one.This book was a very good read but a bit of a let down in the romance department, it concentrated more on the suspense and less on the relationship between John and Niema, they only began to have a relationship right near the end of the book! He never even said he loved her! apart from that it was definately worth paying hardcover prices.Buy the book and decide for yourself, i hope you like it as much as i did. Bye"
4,I WANT MORE!!,"I loved this book! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it needed a little bit more in the romance department. I LOVE how LH combines romance with ""secret spy"" stuff. PLEASE tell me there'll be more. Maybe a telling of Eric Govert's (Hossam) story?"
3,"This book was great,but it lack the Howard fire.","I wasn't disappointed with this book, far from it,but it wasn't Shades of Twilight. John Medina and Niema were great characters and had some very admirable human characteristics which made them to me seem real. I also loved the bad guy, Ronsard and his secret. In this book I learn not to take things at face value everyone has reason behind things and all should learn to forgive. Eventhough this book had its strong points, I truely did not like the ending."
4,Not one of her best - but still a good read,"I am a HUGH fan of Linda Howard's books. This was not one of her best works, but it is still a good read. This book rushed to an ending, just like NOW YOU SEE HER. Still, the plot was a great one and the ending was the only part I didn't list this as a 5 Star book. Only a very small portion of this story was spent on the ending, and I wanted more romance along the end. Linda's forte is romance with suspense."
3,good but lacks the sizzle that Linda Howard usually provides,I was disappointed in this book. I remembered John from Kill and Tell and my expectations were probably too high. He seemed like a very flat character in this book. The heroine Niema was brave and spunky but there was not the usual sparks that Linda Howard usually brings to her stories. Hopefully the next novel will be better!
4,I love John Medina,"He made me want to go hang out near a BUD/S training camp so I could meet someone like him.My biggest criticism of the book was the ending. Did John take the Black Ops desk job? Did they get married or were they just partners-in -spy knocking boots. I needed an epilogue. In Shane Mackienzie's story I thought the epilogue sucked and was unnecessary ( that child, Nick, was so annoying), here where it was needed, nothing. I think LH did not know where to take it. Because Niema's desire to return to the field would not work with being the wife of the black ops head.lastly, this is the second LH book (after the night) I've read where cursing is analogous to deep, abiding love. Is it me or is something not quite right about this? He could've just said I love you. This is the first romance I've read where the woman did not press the man to say he loved her."
2,Not one of her best.,"I am a big Linda Howard fan but this book was a dissapointment. Her other books were a lot better. Where was the story? Everything went off perfectly. Through the whole book I kept waiting for something to happen. The book was truly a bore. The charachters were itteresitng and some of the scenes were hot, but it was not the book I was expecting. After the build up in Kill and Tell this book was a let down. If you have never read Linda Howard I do not reccomend this book. She has written much better stories like Shades of Twilight or Dream Man. Linda Howard is a great a writer but you can't tell it from this book."
3,something different,"I liked this one. Not one of the best but any way readable. Actually I had the idea the this book originally was supposed to be about Chance Mackenzie, but Niema didn't fit into Mackenzie women. She was too independent, too strong. I liked John Medina, but... If the guy waits five years for his lady it gets little boring. And then takes her somewhere really dangerous.I found the love scenes hilarious, but predictable. The absolutely best comment of this book was Niema saying:I would like to introduce you something called foreplay."
5,Do you like good suspense? BUY THIS BOOK!,"Ms. Howard's storylines have truly evolved over time. I loved her earlier works and continue to love the new stuff. Different, but GOOD!If you are a formula romance reader, you aren't gonna like this one. These characters don't leave you with warm fuzzies. What you do get are strong characters (this may be an understatement) - both male and female, interesting locations, and fast paced action.If you want to take a time out from your everyday life and live vicariously through some interesting characters for a few hours . . . BUY THIS BOOK!I read all things Howard and have kept them all. This is no exception."
2,Disappointing,"Linda Howard is an author who runs hot and cold. Her best books (After the Night, Son of Morning) are *so* good that anything less is disappointing.In ""All the Queens Men"" Ms. Howard tries her hand at the world of espionage, the romance in this book takes a back seat to suspense. The hero, John Medina is a cold, unintresting character the reader never warms up to. The romance is completely uninspired.I can't recommend this book, but if you *must* buy it, save your money and wait for the paperback."
3,Before or after 9/11?,I can't say that this book won't thrill you. It will. But also has some boring parts and some things that you know now can't be possible. This is because the airports' security had changed since 9/11 and this book was written before that. Maybe if I read this book before 9/11 I'd give it a higher notch rating.
4,Very Good Read,"I really liked this book. After ""Now You See Her"" I really didn't know what to expect because I didn't much care for it. I checked it out from the library because I didn't want to waste price of HB again. I am now going to buy HB. The storyline was interesting. As one reviewer put I'm glad she didn't blame John for Dallas death but I don't feel she was to blame either. People in those situations are aware of the risk & accept them. I thought there was very good interaction between the characters. One thing I especially liked was John & Niema seemed more like real people. They accepted their attraction & didn't run from it which is the case in most romances. I do agree with the reviewer that said things went a little to smoothly with the copying & bugging of *R's files & office. All in all I'm happy to say LH has won me over again."
3,"Good, but disappointing.","I share the view of some of the other reviewers here who feel that Linda Howard put in too much action and not enough romance. The book was well written with characters I wanted to know more about, it was just the situation was not what I was expecting or, for that matter, particularly interested in. Her last book, Now You See Her, was a perfect blend of suspense and action.One more thing. Who is Harriett Klausner? I see her all over Amazon reviewing books, mostly before they've come out. She has never given any book less than 4 stars - the woman has never read a book she didn't like. I wish I were that lucky."
2,Average for a howard book,"Expected much much better from a book on John Medina. Have been looking forward to it, but found it a letdown. Firstly, we have John, who is a superman who can do everything, maybe even sew a dress. In his line of work, he's constantly surrounded by murder, mayhem and worse, yet he manages to keep his humour and optimism intact without even a hint of cynicism. What does that make him? Ok, superman. Other than this, the lack of suspense in this romantic suspense story really irks. If one wants to know what is truly a romantic thriller, one should check out Anne Stuart's books. Now that's the real stuff."
5,Is it worth the hardcover price???,"Anyone who reads this book, I would like to know if it is worth the hardcover price. I bought ""Now You See Her"" as hardcover. I was disappointed and do not feel I got my money's worth. Before I do the same thing again. I want to know is it worth it???If not I will hold out for the paperback. Thanks!"
2,A bad Linda Howard book,"Definitely a book you should pass onThe thing I did not like about the book is the slowness of how they hook up and plus, I did not enjoy the ""mission"" plotline. To me, the mission they went on did not capture my interest. It was boring for me that I had to skim and skip pages"
5,One of Linda Howard's best!,"I love this book. I can't say how many times I've read it already. I'm afraid that it'll fall to pieces before I've read it enough. I just loved John Medina. I got a knot in my stomach a few times when he thought (or said) a few things that were so romantic. Imagine there being a real guy out there like that. I liked Niema too. Although not for the same reasons of course. It was awful when she lost Dallas but I think she handled it just right. I don't think I would have liked the book at all if she blamed John instead of herself. I actually liked Ronsard too. Strange. To think of the bad guy as a good guy too. That usually doesn't happen to me. But at least he wasn't a ""bad"" guy for the wrong reasons..."
5,I've been waiting for a book like this for MONTHS!,"It has been a while since I've read a book that made me feel so sexy and glad to be a woman. With a well planned out plot, and characters that mingle and blend, Linda Howard has created a book that's unforgettable.As my first Linda Howard book this is, I'm going to read her other works. Fabulous."
5,All the Queen's Men,One of my favorites by Linda Howard. Very fun to read. Not too intense but not too much fluff either.
4,Master does it again,"I couldn't put this one down. I made the mistake of picking it up to start to read it a chapter or two at bedtime. Five hours later I finally closed the book. It was great, it was neat to see how she developed the characters, especially Medina who was literally a ghost in Kill and Tell. Definetly worth reading again, and again, and again."
4,"Exciting, but the ending left me flat.","One of the things I liked most about this book was that it didn't fit into the legendary 'romance formula', it concentrated on a plot filled with action and intrigue and let the romance come later. However, I did miss Howard's customary passion a little. And while I loved the body of the book, the ending fizzled because it seemed forced like she was only allowed to fill so many pages and she had to wrap it up in ten or less. The action dies at the end as does the romance and I found it a disappointing end to a rather interesting, fast-paced book."
2,Disappointed,What direction is Linda Howard moving in? Mainstream suspense? True romance fans will probably be disappointed. I certainly was.
2,Another romance author fails her fans,"Why is it that when romance authors reach the pinnacle of fiction...the NYTimes Bestseller List, they suddenly feel they have to write suspense?? Is there some rule that says ""Oh, you've got all these fans, and we can't have straight romance on the bestseller lists, so write suspense now."" I like suspenseful romance, not the ""romantic suspense"" being served up by many of my favorite romance authors nowadays. Editors? Where are you? Are you publishing anything written, good or bad, just because you can slap their names on the cover and ""count"" on the resulting sales to unsuspecting fans? Won't work, guys... ATQM was too short, had no depth, and the ending was so abrupt I kept turning the pages to find the ""To Be Continued"" line. I've bought every Linda Howard book ever published, but I'm waiting for the paperbacks from now on...and I'll look in UBS first."
4,excellent!,"First ten pages holds you spellbound and it keeps getting better. Fast read, full of excitment with interesting characters and sub-plots within the main plot. Makes you feel like your traveling to other countries with the hero and heroine, in pursuit of the terrorists. A must read for suspense readers!"
4,ALL THE QUEEN'S MEN,"I actually would want to give this book a 5 star rating, but I was a tad disappointed w/ the ending of the story. Looks like the end of the story was written too fast, and there was no mention of our hero's plans when the story ended, like what kind of a future is in store for them after this mission. I think an epilogue or another chapter should have been added to give the readers a knowledge of what has happened after this."
1,Poor video Quality,"I received my dvds very promptly, great service. However the viewing quality of the dvd is poor at best. The picture is so washed out it difficult to se whats going on. The sound quality is poor too. If you're in the mood for retro viewing stick to the old movie theater serials. The quality if these is much much better. I assume its because they were filmed rather video taped."
1,do not buy from amazon,"totally corrupt. used to be good, but now amazon sucks.... adding more stupid words to make these republicans happy. famazon"
4,A GREAT (BIG) BOOK,"This is a great (big) book. My only complaintis it is too big and heavy for casual reading. Didnot like the 3-D glasses provided. Wish I had keptthe ones from TV Guide for viewing ""The Medium"".Most of the photographs could be viewed in boththe usual way plus a small version with 3-D glasses.I found it ""novel"" but hard to hold up the heavy bookand use the box glasses at the right angle too."
5,An exceptional pictorial of the 1906 earthquake,"I've spent hours looking at the photos in Mr. Burkhart's book. They tell a story no words could ever tell, and cover each page of the book's 220 pages. Wow!! That's a lot of photographs. I was amazed!! I, also, really appreciated the 3-D feature which allowed me to see most of the photos in greater depth. Earthquake Days is a unique and brilliantly assembled book with the added bonus of being interactive. I believe it would appeal to children as much as it would adults.Mr. Burkhart did a first rate job of compiling the photographs and telling the story of Earthquake Days. It is a must see book!"
4,"Well conceived, well executed","This is not the book to pick up if you're interested in the 1906 earthquake. Although informative, that is not what this book is trying to achieve. The book is much more a history book about the way photographers using 3-D technology recorded the aftermath. As such, it provides us with amazing photography, and very good quality enlargements of the original photos, so that we may compare ""flat"" 2-D to the 3-D."
3,BEWARE - This book is physically tiny,I obviously did not have read the reviews close enough. This isa tiny book with pictures so small that it's useless to me.
3,Nice LITTLE book,"It a nice LITTLE book for FLW fan, but not what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be a much larger book with stained glass patterns or well, at least ideas large enough. Good for a little book to add to your collection of Frank Lloyd Wright."
5,An old but good book...,"I read this book years ago and was pleased to be able to find it on the used market. It's a fast-paced action novel about the war between the humans and the aliens known as the Jillies. Breakaway station, a usually unimportant relay station manned by the wounded and discouraged, suddenly becomes the focal point on which victory or defeat rides."
3,One of the better books out there,"There are several reasons why this book is good. There is a wonderful breakdown of the different vowel sounds and it also focuses on the southern dialect of Vietnamese which is spoken most in the U.S.Used in an academic setting (whether it be individual or in a class), the drills are very helpful.However, I think the book works best when used together WITH the audio cassette. The two MUST work together to help students aquire the language better. Yes, the authors also developed the audio version but it don't think it supplements the text as well as other foreign language packages have."
1,o_0,"It looked like a really good book, so I downloaded it. The beginning was slow, confusing and made me impatient because what did this have to do with Guin? As I read a little further, it was confusing, creepy and *shivers* dark magic and violent in some ways. I could not read on because it scared me. Not for the faint of heart!!!"
3,a little rough but...,"I actually love this book- am half way through right now and am here on Amazon to order her wolf books. Granted the writting is a bit rough, I have often had to back track to figure out what time of our lady's lifetime I am in or what universe but the basic story line is facinating! A good editor should clean this up a bit but what an imagination!!!!"
2,"Can anyone say ""Mary Sue""?","For the unaware, ""Mary Sue"" is a term used in fanfiction for a character who is, essentially, perfect and has no useful character flaws. Such is Borchardt's Guinevere, as well as what little we've seen of Arthur thus far, and a third character called the Grey Watcher. Guinevere's greatest 'flaw' thus far is a slight level of sexual naivete and a stubborness that really isn't so much of a flaw, anyway. These are virtually the only aspects of her character, except for being ridiculously powerful. At one point she makes a mockery of Merlin-- when she's 13!The plot is interesting, but slow-moving. The second half of the book flips back and forth between what's happening to Guinevere and what's happening to Arthur, and it gets rather confusing.I noticed in the 'about the author' information that Alice Borchardt is actually sister to Anne Rice. I have a sneaking suspicion that that's the main reason anyone gave her a publishing deal..."
1,Absolutely awful,"Rarely have I ever abandoned a book before I finish reading it, but I could not drag myself through even one more page of this horrible book, despite repeated attempts. I was thoroughly disappointed. It has nothing to do with the revisioning and retelling of Arthurian Myth. It has everything to do with the incredibly poor writing, confusing plot and lack of through line, as well as a complete lack of thoughtful and intelligent character development. Save yourself the money, and spare yourself this book."
5,I love this book!,"Don't listen to the people who didn't ""get it"" or couldn't ""follow it"". Go to the book store and read the Prologue. If those two pages don't speak to you, you don't deserve the riches the book has to offer."
3,Like wandering through fog...,"This book could have been much better, had Borchardt eliminated sixty pages or so. I did like the general storyline about Guinevere, but it was so littered with abrupt location changes and weird ""other worlds"" that I just started flipping pages, looking for something that made sense. It was easy to get lost in the many references to ""she"" (the goddess and others) to the point where I just stopped trying to figure out which ""she"" was talking when there were four females having the conversation.Having said that, I gave it three stars because Guinevere was a strong and likeable female character. The addition of the wolf family was a fresh twist. I wish more had been written about them, especially the Gray Watcher. Overall, an average book with some very poetic language at times, albeit somewhat confusing. For a really well written story about Guinevere, try Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot."
5,Wonderfull,"An excelent re-telling of arthurian legends. Guenevere is no longer the whiney, annoying, trophy wife of Arthur. The daughter of Queen Boadiccea, a pagan priestess-queen, she is blessed by extra-ordinary powers. As Dragon Queen she is able to comunicate with her wolf brethren (she was raised by a wolf whom she calls mother that visits her in dreams) and with dragons as well. I recently finished this book and can not wait for the sequel."
2,Dazed and Confused,"I love fantasy books and I liked Alice Borchardt's previous wolf books and the Devoted books. But this book jumps from character to character, from story to story, from one ""world"" to the next ""world"" with very little in the way of transition, explanation or logic. I understand that this book is about ""magical"" things and events, but for goodness sake, I found myself wondering what the heck was going on WAY more often than is necessary. And I kept thinking that at the end it would end up making some sort of sense...but no such luck. Get Ms. Borchardt's other books and skip this one."
2,Not worth the $/time I spent on it,"I totally agree with the reader from Long Island, and I wish I would have taken what she said to heart before I bought this book. I'm about halfway through, and Borchardt is all over the place-between the talking dragons, Guinevere's hand that acts as a torch, and an evil Merlin and Igraine, I'm not finding this to be a very satisfying book. I'm the kind of person that won't put a book down once I find a decent one, and let's just say it's been a few days since I've picked The Dragon Queen up. I also find it strange that Maenial can turn into a wolf, and the whole story just seems weird-I would strongly suggest that someone interested in Arthurian legend try either Stephen Lawhead, or my all time fave Jack Whyte, who takes an ancient Roman viewpoint on it all, in his Camulod Chronicles."
2,"When your own sister gets the cover blurb, it's a problem","I'm currently about halfway through this book and am finding the intense desire to skip pages to get to a decent plot. This is not to see that the actual plot is bad - unfortunatly it's difficult to find. One must wade through page after page of pointless subplot before getting to anything of substance. If I would have known that, I probably wouldn't have picked this book up."
2,Cover Photo is Nice,"What sounded interesting on the DVD of the PBS special does not sound as interesting without the visual. The PBS show only had snippets of the various groups performing very traditional and somewhat archaic Christmas songs. However, listening to the songs in their entireity is a dull experience. If you listen to the first song on this CD, you've basically heard them all. There are better Christmas CDs out there, many even have full orchestras accompanying the singers."
3,bridget jones diary,I don't agree with missing 'an't no mountain high enough - how could you. Also someone like you was sung by Van Morrison - the CD should be the same as Film - how could you.Not buying it now - instead will buy Van Morrison CD.
5,"Great CD, but...","It must be revealed that track 6 on this CD is not ""Just Perfect"" by Tracy Bonham, but ""Don't get me wrong"" by the Pretenders, which is also found on Vol. 2 of the soundtrack. In order to get ""Just Perfect"" you have to buy the domestic version. I presonally think it's worth sacrificing one song to get both volumes of the import though, as they're certainly high-quality stuff."
3,Bridget Jones Diary,"I agree with Sara from Essex, ""Someone Like You"" is a Van Morrison song, NOT Dina Carroll. I won't buy the CD because of that!"
4,Enjoyable Read,"One of Anne Rice's few novels that does not feature any supernatural elements; this is all historical fiction. If you love New Orleans, then you will definitely love this book. It comes off as a pretty fair and accurate description of 1840's Louisiana, I like how she works in a good amount of history without digressing from the story line. I found the parts about the Haitian Revolution to be particularly interesting.My complete review can be found at my blog:http://theforlornpath.blogspot.com/2012/01/feast-of-all-saints.html"
4,"Showtime adapted ""Feast"" into a film","Just wanted to let fans know I have recently discovered that ""Feast"" was adapted into a 2 part film by Showtime in 2001. I have never seen the DVD's available in stores but found them by surprise on the shelf at my library. I was unaware of this adaptation. Amazon does have the DVD for sale for anyone who is interested."
4,"Not only poignant and moving, but also unique.","Set in Rice's favorite town of New Orleans, this beautifully crafted novel is a must read. Rice follows the trials of a mulatto family who struggle to find happiness in the 1840s. This novel is not only a poignant and moving story, it is also unique. New Orleans of the 1840s is a world apart from our own, ripe with new adventures to explore. The story follows young Marcel who is the son of an aristocratic plantation owner and his African-American mistress. Marcel strives to live up to the expectations he has set for himself, and struggles under the caste system prevalent in the city of New Orleans. His experiences, as well as those of his sister, his mentor, and his best friend finally lead him to recognize the truths about life he'd known all along."
3,"Great characters, fascinating history, but...","The characters in Saints are all interesting, and the fact that this is historical fiction certainly helps make them more so. My biggest gripe is that the narrative is excessive and bogged-down at times - not as bad as some scholar might have it - but still leaving you doubting most of the time that much of the extra detail helps develop the story. Also, the author's strength lies in straight-forward story telling, there's no artistic style to her words, but none the less her stories are gripping on their own."
4,Fascinating historical novel,"This absorbing melodrama explores the complex hierarchal and insular community of white upper class landowners and their ""free"" mulatto mistresses and their progeny. Set within the larger context of 19th century New Orlean's slave society, Anne Rice recreates the unique power dynamics within these relationships which don't always have a predictable outcome. Fascinating because it is based on historical facts."
2,Very hard to get into,"I tried to like this book, I really did, but try as I might, I could not fall in love with it, even a little. I dont know what it was, but it was almost torture to read it. I found it disinteresting and quite boring at times. I found myseld losing track of who did what and which character was which. I usually dont have that issue when reading anything. I was truly dissapointed as I love Anne, she is my favorie author. I breathed a great sigh of relief after finishing it because it felt like I had just ran a marathon and was tired and out of breath after. And not in a good way. The last few chapters were much more interesting but it was not enough to redeam this mess of a book."
5,The best Anne Rice book ever!!!!,"I have read every Anne Rice book written, I love the vampires and the Mayfairs and find myself thinking about them, wondering what they are doing and when they will be back, BUT, this book set in the French Quarter is the best book I have ever written by Anne Rice or by anyone else for that matter! It just so happened that I went to New Orleans when I was about 100 pages into the book and found myself standing on the very streets she so vividly describes. I walked down Rue St. Anne looking for Marcell's home, I pictured the shops and streets as I finished this book and I strongly recommend reading it! If you love history, intrique and passion, this book is for you! I am only sorry that she has chosen not to write a sequel, but Showtime has bought the rights for a mini-series! Thank you once again Anne Rice for such a wonderful reminder of our past!"
5,A Must Read for Anyone Interested in Creole Culture,"In this book Anne Rice manages to couple a wonerful storyline with a rich dose of historical data. She is not an imitator that helps to carry on the negative stereotypes about Southern Lousiana. Mrs. Rice has definitely done her homework on this subject and this shines through in her rich desriptive detail.. She was able to convey the attitudes, beliefs, and feeeling felt by this unique group of people to her readers. My experience with all the Anne Rice books that I have ever read were wonderful, but this particualr book stands head and shoulders above the rest. I would also like to know ""where's the sequel?"""
5,We can't morph anymore,School's out for the animorphs. But that does not mean that the evil yeerks are going to stop controlling people's minds or chasing the kids (or andalites) with the abilities to change into any animal they touch. But Rachel has gone to a gymnastics camp she signed up for before getting into the whole mess. She decides to fly a little before going away. She is attacked by sparrows or something and crashes into a tree. When she wakes up she has lost her memory and guesses she is some freak of nature. The other animorphs have a little problem of their own. Each time they morph a dangerous Yeerk creature comes to capture them. What good is morphing if you can't do it without a monster sensing it? And will Rachel regain her memory? I like this book because it's a unique blend of many first-person narratives.
5,A great book for Animorph fans!,"A great book for Animorph fans! It is told by Jake, Marco, Cassie, Rachel, Tobias, and even Ax. I give it, like all other Animorph books, a perfect 10!"
5,What? Bookstores out of them? I'm not surprised!,"A mad dust beast named the Veleek has been chasing the Animorphs around. Why? The morphing attracts it. Each of them have problems.""I couldn't remember anything. Who was I? What am I?""-Rachel""I was stuck. I couldn't get out. The Veleek would catch me soon.""-Marco<I stood there watching. Watching them getting captured one-by-one.>-Tobias<I was stuck. I couldn't get out of the Veleek's grip.>-Ax""You mean you can do 6 morphs, three changes, including one totally new morph?""-Cassie""I watched the Veleek hover ahead trying to catch Marco and Ax.""-Jake""BEST BOOK IN HISTORY!""-Me"
3,A good book full of action,"This book is great for young readers. One of the girls loses her memory, which displays strong emotion. As a vital key to catch young boys atention it also has action, and courage. It's good how the author shows the story from all of the characters points of views. It is a good page turner!"
4,It is almost perfect.,It is good. The plot is great. Except it is hard to go from person to person remembering what happened to that person last chapter.
5,It's the BEAST!!!I mean BEST!!!,"You'll devour this book like a Hork-Bajir. It all started one weekend, they decided to take a weekend off. But who knew that on the way to a gymnastics camp Rachel would lose her memory?Or that Visser Three would get a morph-hunter?Or that Ax would be captured by this creature?Or how this book ends. You can know that by reading this book!"
2,Nice Try .... But No Cigar!,"This is a shakey release of ""supposedly good hard rock"" and it misses the mark for many reasons. Let me first make it known that I am a !!!!BIG!!!! Deep Purple and Rainbow fan and I am a true fan of hard rock and heavy metal music in general and many other countless GOOD! bands that have some decent degree of originality to what they are doing. This release has very little of that kind of quality. The biggest problem I have with this CD is Glenn Hughes. The way you change the tone in your voice while you sing is not good, try to sing normal and maybe it would sound much better. Also what is up with that picture on the back of the CD?. You two guys are Trying to look Cool and Fail Badly!!. Where are any pictures of the other people who contributed to this release???. This is a Rip Off of Deep Purple, Rainbow and Cheesy 80's Metal. VERY little New or Original here. This is a Disappointing Release People!!!. Be forewarned and save your money and not throw it away like I did."
4,A pair of aces!,"A veritable powerhouse,the pairing of Glenn Hughes with Joe Lynn Turner,both with legendary Deep Purple resumes,comes to magnificent fruition on this gem of an album.Besides the talented band backing them up,there are also stellar appearances by Paul Gilbert(ex-Mr.Big),Akira Kajiama,and the one and only John Sykes who,besides rewriting the chorus,also produced a spellbinding guitar solo on the ballad ""Heaven's Missing An Angel"".The album is powerful,classy and very polished,with supreme vocals and musicianship in the best Purple and beyond tradition with a strong bass and keyboard presence creating beautiful backgrounds and solid grooves.This is not only one of the best issues of 2002,but also an assured classic."
5,drenched in Lanois-style production,"Colin Linden, the producer and gutar player has stolen every production lick of Daniel Lanois -- which works well in a strange balance with the tape loops of Reddick's voice and Linden's guitar. Fascinating work. Great harmonica, intelligent lyrics and lots of good guitar licks. Gets better and better with repeated listenings."
