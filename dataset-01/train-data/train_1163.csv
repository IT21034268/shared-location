5,Good,"Fantastic condition as it came in both DVD and Bluray disc. Had it digital code intact aand in prestine order. Well packaged, instant delivery and well cordinated. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Nothing Special,"Obviously trying to keep the success of the Bourne franchise going, but this installment simply lacks the punch the movies before it packed. Just and ok action thriller."
3,solid movie,"This movie's biggest drawback was mostly that it was a sequel, so they didn't take the time to develop the plot more. Regardless, it was an interesting movie with a good pace."
2,Very slow,This movie was very slow. It was also the exact same plot as the other Bourne movies just less exciting.
4,Lotsa fun.,No Academy Award for this film but it was certainly fun to watch! If you like the Bourne story you'll enjoy this film.
2,not a legacy,"nothing more than a rip-off of the jason bourne movies. it was not a good movie. junk, junk & not good junk"
3,audio 5.1,picture quallity was great but dissapointed the audio was not streaming in 5.1 or dts audio this the second movie this has happened
2,Amazon Streaming was totally pixelated,We watched this move via Amazon streaming and the video kept getting pixelated and the audio cut in an out. It made it hard to watch the movie.
3,Better than the second and third but still not as good as the first,"There was a lot of action but not really anything for a plot. Not only that, but they introduced a lot of new story arcs but never really did anything with them. The plot they did have, wasn't that great. It just wasn't that good of a movie."
2,drugs are bad,The plot was pretty thin and didn't have nearly the character development that the first three movies had. The drug-driven plot was not very interesting and was almost entirely inconsistent with the first three movies.
3,Action Without Excitement,"The movie had a lot of movement and chase scenes, just not the excitement of all the other Bourne films. Did not live up to my expectations."
3,Great scenery,Great scenery but the plot is subpar. The Bourne series is too one sided in painting these balck ops as totally evil. Would have been better if it left the viewer with a more complicated choice whether the programs they talk about are good or not.
4,Way to carry on!,"When I heard that Matt Damon didn't want to do another Bourne movie I truly thought the franchise was over. Then enters Jeremy Renner, who I only remembered from the movieMarvel's The Avengers. I didn't think anyone else could pull the franchise, but I must admit that he did an awesome job! The movie was really good! It had action, excitement, and a very good plot. All I know is that I can't wait to see what happens in the next installment."
4,just what you would expect,"I have enjoyed all of the previous movies in this series and this one was no different. Great action and story. If you like these types of action films, this one should not disappoint you."
4,Great action movie,Jeremy Renner was great in this movie and what a body he has. Loved the motorcyle chase. Lots of action. Bought this for my collection.
3,good movie,It is a good movie but it is the same as the original trilogy. But still a solid action movie.
2,Bring Jason back!,I was really looking forward to this after watching the first 3 Bourne movies this week. Was really let down with this movie. Jason Bourne makes this new guy look like a comedian. This movie must have been produced all in 2 or 3 days.
3,OK but liked the first story more,Like this actor did a great job But if they make another I will watch itLove this kind of movie
4,Great movie ties in well with the original trilogy,This was a good story line it expands on the trilogy and keeps open the possibilityof more films.great action!
5,Jeremy Renner you sexy beast!,I love this movie! Im a huge fan of the Bourne movies and this one did not disappoint. Jeremy Renner was awesome! My new celeb crush <3
2,Liked the previous movies better,"The Bourne Legacy was not as good as the previous Bourne Movies. The beginning of the movie was uninteresting and took to long for any action. Wait until the movie is played on HBO, Showtime, Encore, or Max and you will most likely enjoy it more."
4,"that how I feel about the movie, that what you asked for.","it was good but wasnt jason bourne. like the new true grit, he ant john wayne. i didnt like the new true grit."
3,Not Bourne,"This movie is Bourne only in title. There is some action, but the suspense and drive of the other Bourne movies is missing."
2,Jumpy,Movie itself was almost OK but streaming was terrible. It kept stopping and stating from the beginning. Download it if you can first
2,Not as good at the first three Bourne moview,"I felt the movie lacked the feel of the first three Bourne movies, which I loved all of those. They kept you on the edge of your seat, while Bourne Legacy was kind of thin on the plot and could have used just a little more...ummmm...""magic"" in the movie."
2,Bourne Legacy,If following the last Bourne kept going back to people that should have been in jail and apparently they weren't and accusing Pamela Landy of treason. Their is too much that has not been explained
3,Sequel to Legacy to Tie you into the next big show,It wasn't as good as the previous Legacy's because the plot was scattered. It didn't flow as a story too well. It was just lots of action and thrill without the depth. But I thought the main actor's acting was good.
2,A Bourne rip-off,In a quest to make money they took a character and tried to make a new character and failed.Not even close to the original film and character ----- don't waste you money
4,Bourne Legacy,"Special effects were cool, weapons were cool, bike scene was awesome, hoping for a little more gun play myself. Looking foreward for next movie."
3,Complex plot interwoven with other Bourne story.,The plot is complex as it is interwoven with other Bourne story. Probably should have read the book first. I still find it hard to understand as to what is the bourne connection?
3,Love Jeremy Renner,"It was exciting as a race would be, from beginning to end, just not enough intrigue for me. My girlfriend loved it!"
4,Action in the Bourne tradtion with surprising in depth characters,"Excellent and detailed preparation for the next one to come. It was surprising in the characterdevelopment department, in that the characters were surprisingly developed in depth. While the currentedition was not completely satisfying it certainly built up a desire for a movie (part 2?) to follow.The movie was worth my time and money."
4,There never was just one the Bourne Legacy,"The Bourne Legacy is a better movie than people say. I get Roger Ebert Reviews from the Chicago sun times and mister Ebert talked about flashback footage to the previous Bourne movie. The new Jason Bourne is good and the film shows him undergoing survival training as an agent. Most fans would rather have the Bourne franchise go on than not. I have written Bourne movie treatments having taken a writers course. It is possible that Matt Damon might return some day as Jason Bourne to the big screen, allegedly Matt Damon has Universal send him Bourne Movie treatments to read. Edward Norton is a great actor and so is Rachel Weisz."
3,Too convoluted for a great movie,"Characters were not clearly delineated from the first track of movies, which caused some confusion about who was who. Most mainline characters were the same, but some differed or were new characters and that was unclear."
4,decent movie,I have seen all the other Bourne movies and this didn't disappoint. Not the best one but it leaves the door open for more sequels.
1,"Usual, usual, usual","This movie was utterly and completely horrible, not even worth the price to rent it. It's the exact same as all the other movies, just with a different person. He runs from the government and successfully gets a way, just like every other Bourne movie. It also leaves a lot of questions unanswered."
3,I liked the first series better,"This movie was ok, but does not seem as original as the first series. Does an ok job of explaining some of the background of the ""programs"", but is not really consistent with the ""Behavioral Modification"" theory mentioned in the first Bourne movie. Overall, I think I would rather watch those movies Bourne Supremacy again than watch this movie."
4,"Good movie, but Miss ""Jason Bourne""",I like this movie a lot and have been a fan of the past Bourne movies. I missed Matt Damon in this series but I thought Jeremy Renner did a fantastic job in the movie. I wish there was more action and fighting scene but it was nice that it wasn't identical to the other 3 movies.
2,"It all felt like a set up for a movie, without the movie","It did not make me feel involved in the movie or concerned with the characters, some of the action was interesting."
2,Fell short of expectation,"Story itself is so vague and pointless. More like a cat-mouse type of movie and Main Character, Aaron isn't same as Jason Bourne! So Disappointing"
5,Good movie,"This was a good action filled movie, it picked right up from where the last bourne left off. Jeremy is a good actor and really nailed it in this movie. The only thing I didn't like was the ending, but you have to see it to see what I am talking about. I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it. A must have for the action lovers."
1,yuck,The first Bourne movie was the best by far! I do not know what to say about this movie other than it was just bad. Most of the guys I work with think it was an OK movie.
1,Not the Bourne I was looking for.,I have loved all the previous movies. I was apprehensive about watching this movie in the first place. I should have listened to my gut feeling. This was horrible. It took almost an hour before the first fight scene. This movie is definitely a lead up to a following film in all honesty I say skip this movie. It just is not worth the money nor the time.
1,bourne...boring,"I liked the actor, but a mediocre follow on. For me actors were okay, story fell flat. Can't just wreck cars, fire some weapons and call it a movie...oh wait...Skyfall did the same thing!"
1,Worst movie I have ever seen,"This movie went nowhere. The acting was good but the storyline and directing were horrible. For me, it was even worse as I loved the original three. Complete waste of time and money."
1,Ok but not as good as original,Not as good as other three before it but ok. Kind of lame ending. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1,Senseless Chase Flick,Some good graphics and something or other from an attractive Weicz (who deserved a better vehicle than this) or I'd rate it a zero. An insult to the very fine Bourne series.
1,Pathetic and a disgrace to the Bourne trilogy,"For those who loved the Borne trilogy, don't waste your TIME (2:15!!) This was the most pathetic attempt to recreate or to continue the Bourne Movies. It was terribly edited!! So friggin slow, I was waiting and waiting for something to happen and it never really did. They made money off of using Bourne in the title!! He almost gets beat by a female psychiatrist. He get's shot once and passes out!!!! Really?!!!!?"
3,3 Stars: Middle of the Road OK,"The movie does a nice job incorporating parts of the last Bourne movies to bring the movie watcher into what this movie is about. However, this movie was a bit slower and had some scenes that were too long winded (chase in Philippines). Its just OK."
4,Lots of Action - Non-stop,"Keeps you engaged. Good action flick. Continues the ""legacy"" of ""edge of your seat"" involvement. Five mores words are required."
4,Good,This is a good follow up to the Bourne series. You might want to brush up on the previous movies before watching it so you're not confused. Very entertaining movie.
4,TBL,"Good story line, but while watching the movie it would stop streaming. The disruption in the movie made it difficult to enjoy the movie."
2,"Good movie, crappy Amazon delivery thanks to no surround sound","I thought the Bourne Legacy was a good movie and better than I expected it would be, since I had heard it wasn't as good as the first three movies. Thankfully it was better than expected.But since I rented it through Amazon and this movie in HD was conspicuously devoid of surround sound, as an HD movie should be, Amazon gets a MAJOR FAIL for the delivery of this movie, especially at $5.99 and in this day an age - there's absolutely no excuse why an HD movie should be delivered in stereo only.I honestly don't think I will ever rent another movie from Amazon again and will stick with VUDU. Shame on you Amazon!!!"
2,bo-ring,a pale imitation of the real (Matt Damon) Bourne movies. nowhere near as interesting or exciting. surprisingly little action for an action movie
2,put together cheaply,"one deep secreat government is enough, now we go farther under ground and the motor cycle action to unbelievable, not real story a lot of piece together from past movies"
3,Good action but hard to follow plot,This was a really good action movie but the plot was a bit difficult to follow. The story runs parallel to the other Bourne movies. Good movie the first time but it's not a repeat-watch for me.
5,5 stars,I got this for my husband. He loved it. Great movie. Great quality. He was very satisfied and recommends it to others.
2,Bourne Legacy,"Too much action, not much story. Poor linkage to the past. Mediocre at best. Misss Matt Damon who personified the role. Without Damon, should stop trying to stretch the series."
2,pointless,If you are a fan of the Bourne franchise then this movie will make your stomach turn. There is not a plot in this movie. Action movie typically have s very loose/shaky one but Legacy was just lost. There isn't enough action to just enjoy it as a simple action movie. When you get to the ending you will scream THAT'S IT! Pass this movie I want my money back
3,Disappointing,A decent chase scene or two but not worth the 2+ hours. The plot was thin and it took a while for the movie to get moving. This movie did not live up to any of the previous Bourne's.
2,No Matt Damon!!,"I prefer Matt Damon and more action to the Bourne movies. While it was interesting, it seemed to move too slowly."
2,Dissapointing,"I knew this movie has not gotten not-so-good reviews but still wanted to watch another Bourne film. Seems there is a lack of character development of the new main character. Also as a viewer, I felt as if I was just watching a series of events that seem very disconnected from one another. The new agent (main character) seems to have no color of his own, and this makes me not interested in getting to know the character."
2,No beginning No End,"I can understand the no beginning, as the movie is a continuation of the Bourne saga. But, it has no ending, the movie just ends. the bad guys are still after him. I was watching the chase scene at the end of the movie, they got away and as they were on a boat the movie ends."
4,ok but not damion,Renner and wweitz were good but the guy in the meet house stunkand was not believable he seemed to be the enemy and not a fellow operative
3,Eh..,"Good action, but no real story. Basically just Jeremy Renner running around beating people up. The characters are superficially interesting, but that's it."
3,Doesn't hold up to the Bourne trilogy,I'm a huge Bourne fan and this was hard to follow and not quite as smart as the other Bourne movies.
3,Not as good as earlier movies,"It tries to model the structure, pace, and types of scenes from previous movies, but it doesn't quite do it smoothly. Actors do a good job."
2,Can't Hold a Candle to Its Predecessors -- Completely unnecessary film,"The Bourne Series is officially dead. This film was completely unnecessary as it was basically the same as the first Bourne movie but only half as good. They really should have just stopped. The only reason they made this film was because the Bourne Name is so huge that making it would net them an easy $150 million regardless of script.Its not that this film is bad per say, moreso that it is just completely redundant and compared to its predecessors, its just not a good film. If the 1st three Bourne films were lions and tigers than this film would be a sick house cat by comparison"
4,A decent continuation of the bourne franchise,At first glimpse this film looked like a waste of time. But in fact it was actually not that bad of a continuation of this particular franchise.
3,Just another installment.,"We start off technically where we left off. And for those of US that have not left off. There are plenty of flashbacks to catch us up where we left off.Jason Bourne is still on the loose; he gets a cameo picture in this movie. Our new hero for this film is the estranged operative Aron Cross (Jeremy Renner) who comes in from the cold to find he was scheduled for dispatch. Only he has no intention of coming in quietly. He is assisted and assists the beautiful Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) as they race for a cure and escape from the evil U.S. government cabal of know-it-alls.Lots of blood and guts and cheesy scenes, beautiful women, big guns, wide country, and no definitive ending.Okay now we are ready for the next movie."
3,"Not as good as first series, but enjoyable","Interesting conspiracy theory, as all the Bourne stories, with an exciting, if unbelievable chase scene. Great scenery and special effects."
4,Good..not great,"They tried to compact too much in one movie. the character build up is good but then there is maybe 2 really good action scenes . I enjoyed it for sure, but it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be."
2,Inept continuation of a franchise,"No substance as a sequel and it underwhelms, the connection to the previous Bourne film's events are pointless, solely to justify the use of the Bourne name for marketing purposes. Action set pieces--especially in the final are dull and overlong."
1,this movie is terrible,"it's not anything like the previous ones, which could have been good, but isn't. i need 6 more words in this review."
3,Wasn't bad,"But would not watch it a second time. I like Jeremy Renner, he was great in The Avengers as Hawkeye. Worth a rental not a buy!"
3,Bourne Legacy,Not much of anything to brag about. My expectation was that this movie would be as good if not better than the first three.
2,Snoooze,"This movie was mildly entertaining but only toward the end with the motorcycle sequences. The plot--such as it was--was disjointed and hardly made sense. Heck, I disliked this movie so much, that I'm not going to comment on it further other than to say that it wasn't worth the cost to view it."
2,Boring Movie,Liked the back ground story but boring to watch.Just not as good as all other awesome Bourne movies.Very disappointed :(
2,Disappointing,"Too much dialogue and not enough action. I was expecting more high octane action and the usual twist and turns of a ""Bourne"" movie. What I got was drawn out dialogue and a very boring movie."
3,Good action both nothing new to offer,Good acting and good action but story is cliche and there's not much originality or creativity. Movie was a little bland.
2,very disappointed,As a Borne fan and a Jeremy Renner fan and movie was very disappointing. there was some good action scenes but the ending was really anticlimactic
4,I have all the Bourne movies and most of the books.,"If you read the book, you probably would not agree with the movie. It's a modern and undated movie. If you seen the extended edition of ""The Bourne Identity"",you would know that Robert Ludlum wanted that way."
4,"Predictible, but no character development","Great stunts though,didn't see the connection develop between the main characters...disappointing. Great bike stunts though. No more chase scenes please, they have been done to death and are boring..."
5,The Bourne Legacy doesn't disappoint,"You should expect an entertaining movie with Edward Norton and Jeremy Renner in it. Both are good actors and carry their scenes. Both quickly establish their characters and make them believable. The movie takes off at a rapidly fast pace. You must pay attention or you might lose some of the plot. While it takes a wide divergence from the Matt Damon Bourne movies, it delivers a credible sequel that actually convinces you that Jason Bourne is wreaking havoc with the CIA while Aaron Cross is finding a way to save his life. The action scenes are fast paced and numerous. While Jason Bourne still seems more deadly to me, Aaron Cross can kill you silently and swiftly. I would recommend this movie to all Jason Bourne fans. If you like Jason Bourne, you will like Aaron Cross."
5,A Realistic Legacy,"This was a Great movie,Realistic and not so fantasy . With modern day understanding I can see our government actually implimenting a secret program such as this."
3,It was ok,Too long and too much car chase. Predictable but kind of expected that since it was a Bourne movie. OK
3,Ho Hum....,"Not sure whether it was Jeremy Renner or the cookie-cutter 'Bourne' story line, but I just haven't been able to get into this movie. It offers a good cast, good acting, good cinematography, and good action sequences. But therein lies the problem: it's just good, not great like the Matt Damon series. At no point in the film did I feel that I really cared what happened to Renner's character. Hey, I'm not a movie aficionado; I'm just a guy who really liked the three previous Bourne films and was disappointed that Damon declined to go on with it. I was curious what the new adaptation would offer, and having now seen it, largely unmoved. Perhaps if the connections go forward with another entry, they'll figure out what this effort lacked and make the necessary adjustments. I hope so, because I don't feel any closure yet to this story."
2,Ho Hum,Trying to recapture the Bourne saga without the Jason himslef is like casting the Easter Bunny as Santa Claus. Story was a rehash.
2,A disappointment compared to the trilogy,The most unrealistic car chase scene ever! Is this a comedy? I was laughing at the ridiculous stunts like two people on a motorcycle grinding down a railing...
1,How did this get made?,"I think the best action sequences were shown on the commercial. Two really great actors, but a terrible, terrible movie."
2,Disappointed!,"I had high hopes for this installment of the Bourne series, but without Matt Damon, the movie just fell flat. It just couldn't keep my attention, and I ended up turning it off ten minutes from the end."
2,A floop,"This movie was nothing like the other Bourne movies, and had I known that I would not have given a plug nickel to see this one."
2,Disappointing,Movie just did not live up to the hype. Previous Bourne movies certainly surpass this debacle. Gave it a 2 star because I like Jeremy Renner.
3,Explanations Please,"Give us a little more background on why they needed to take the pills. Also, expected more coherent plot than was actually there. Dragged in spots."
3,Bored Legacy,"This was an alright film. I felt that it dragged on and constantly reminded us of how great Jason Bourne is. Legacy goes into more background and side stories from the Bourne universe, and while interesting was not necessary. Jeremy Renner does a fine job here though and just adds to his great year of films."
2,Bourning,Snooze fest in comparison to other Bourne movies. Lots of mystery that never comes up with answers. Ending was only meant to allow for yet another show
3,Disappointing,I was really looking forward to the new release but had difficulty staying awake to the end. Weak story line.
3,Not as good as the other Bourne movies.,The script left a lot to be desired in this one. The other Bourne movies were much better. Relied too much on the action and too little on the plot.
3,Done with Deaver,"My third and last attempt at Deaver lit. I loved The Blue Nowhere. The Bodies Left Behind was okay but left behind my interest with bodies one and two as the book dragged on several plot twists over the line. The Vanished Man, however, was wildly uneven, starting clever and reaching ""oh for heaven's sake, what the hell is that about"" by book's end.The reader on the CDs is excellent, very talented at characterization without taking it too far. Lincoln Rhyme is a kind of techno-talented Nero Wolfe, a home-bound genius detective confined to quarters in an entirely different way. But any comparison Deaver to Rex Stout ends there as the cheap, under-developed plot surprises stress the indulgence of the ""revered audience,"" and, as in The Bodies Left Behind, made me wish I'd stopped this recording one disc short of done.It opens four star, ends two star, thus three star average."
2,"Oh, come on now!","I'm willing to ""suspend disbelief"" in the interest of a good novel, but this is too much. The plot line is so contrived and convoluted as to be preposterous. The characters are largely unexplored and there only to act out the plot, which again, is preposterous. There is some information about magic which is interesting if true, but it's not enough to redeem this ridiculous book."
3,"Not his best, but still good","Deaver does know how to spin an engrossing yard. My only complaint is that some of the solutions (I won't spoil them here) seem contrived, a bit forced. But I like the way Deaver finds new ways to go deeper into his characters, especially the recurring ones. I read a lot of thrillers and would say this one fall about in the middle, maybe a little better."
2,UGH!,"Great plotting (why repeat what others have already outlined?), but totally unbelievable. The characters are one dimensional and not very likeable. Everyone is perfect at what he/she does. I could not believe for one second that all these events could have taken place in such a short period of time. There was nothing credible in this book, at all. Deaver (or more likely, his assistants) did some great research for this novel, but that's the only compliment I can give him. The writing style is trite and without any originality or lyricism. A better writer could have done so much more with this information. I could barely finish it - Deaver's style just annoyed the hell out of me. I'll never read another one of his books."
1,This book shouldn't disappear from the shelves!,"This was my 2nd Deaver novel. I forgot the first one I started, but that should be no surprise. I didn't finish that one either!This plot is so far-fetched, so convoluted, so full of cardboard characters that I gave up on it after 175 pages. Too bad. It started out promising, a nice twist on tracking down a killer(s): He/she always had magic incorporated into the scheme. But this story just went on far too long (keep in mind, I didn't even finish it) and got so unconvincing and outrageous that I had to move on. So many books, so little time. I think my Deaver days are over. Give me Crais or Coben or David Ellis anyday."
3,The pace was just too slow for me,"The Vanished Man by Jeffery Deaver became interesting after about 200 pages, which is way too much. I was planning to stop reading but I continued because of all the great things I had heard about Jeffery Deaver. The Vanished Man is probably not one of his greatest novels; I found it to be just okay. After this novel, I do not think I will read novels that are only about solving crimes.I recommend this for those that want to know more about the techniques used by detectives to find criminals, are able to put up with the slow pace, and who enjoy reading crime solving books in general.3/5"
4,Penn and Killer?,"Misdirection is a fundamental part of all of Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme stories. Through forensic wizardry Rhyme and Sachs brilliantly zero in on the right line of investigation, pursue it, then inevitably get hit with a plot twist from left field. So to build an entire story around a homicidal illusionist whose talents of misdirection are a central theme of the story kind of puts Deaver's plotting techniques out in the open for the reader to see. It also enables him to weave a more complex web of head fakes and suspense filled surprises.Though the acts of the Conjurer, his escapes, characters who come back from the dead and things you think happened that didn't are all totally outrageous, Rhyme is up against a criminal from whom we would expect no less. The combination makes ""The Vanished Man"" work."
1,Just too much!!,Although this book gives a good insight into police procedures I really had a hard time finishing this book. YAWN!! Though I have never read any other Deaver books I thought this was too contrived and he should have stopped at least 100 pages earlier. Not inclined to read more of Deaver police novels. Go to Michael Connelly for a good read!
4,Entertaining,Just when you think you have it figured out - you don't. Just when you think it's over - it's not!
3,"Deaver is good, but I figured out the puzzle instantly.","Deaver is good, but I figured out the puzzle of the Vanished Man instantly, so the story was ruined right from the very beginning. Relax, I won't spoil it for you.But anyone can figure it out. It is not even half as complex as an Arthur Conan Doyle ""Sherlock Holmes"" adventure. I was so disappointed that such an easy trick as that was used by the author. I wish a more elaborate ruse had been employed instead and the book would have been enjoyable.Deaver is excellent at prose and dialogue, but the main attraction of his stories are the labyrinthine plots that are SO inventive! Not this time though. Maybe you'll be lucky and won't figure it out on page 10 like I did."
2,Tedious and not so magical a storyline,"I really do like Lincoln Rhyme stories by Jeffery Deaver. This one just went on too long and was hard to get into. Magic was at the heart of the storyline and sometimes descriptions were vivid and sometimes just clouded by confusion. I never really got into the story, I didn't care for the main character and then find that he wasn't the pivotal villain after all. I can't put my finger on why I didn't care for this novel, but, I know something isn't right when I don't want to add the book to my collection. I cherish books I have read, and even if I don't re-read them, I know that I can. This book will go to Goodwill and I hope the next book I read will get me back on the Lincoln Rhyme track of enthusiasm."
4,A Little Unbelievable......,"but still a good read. I've read several of Deaver's books and I thought this one was on par with the others. About halfway through, you kind of start to feel that the villain must be the greatest criminal on the planet to pull off the things he does. That however doesn't keep The Vanished Man from being an enjoyable read. I hate when other reviewers give a bad review because a book isn't ""believable"". Hell, Superman isn't believable at all, but it's still good.If you like Deaver's work, you'll like this one."
5,GREAT book - but who's Kara? (WARNING - possible spoiler),"Deaver has become my favorite crime thriller author. Even his weaker books are better than most, but this is absolutely one of his best works. The plot and pacing are tight and the central theme of magic, illusion and misdirection fit Deaver's writing style perfectly. In fact, if read between the lines, the book almost reads like a Jeffery Deaver primer on how to construct a thriller.One of the most intriguing characters in this book is an apprentice magician named Kara, a coffee-addicted pixie-ish girl with hair dyed purple, although it's been dyed several other colors in the past. Kara's the stage name she uses as a performer, and we never learn her real name. At one time, she worked at a magazine, and has been involved with the police in criminal investigations before. Old school Deaver fans - does anything about this character sound familiar? My bet is that we see Kara again...and find out that her real name is Rune."
4,Interesting and unusual,Lots of magic and misdirection in this novel. It keeps your attention and keeps moving. Very entertaining and recommended reading for pure relaxation.
3,Wore me out,"I am a faithful fan of Deaver, IF it's a Lincolm Rhyme novel. As usual, Deaver filled the book with interesting facts, this time about magic. For once though, I found one of his books very unbelievable and it almost made me mad in parts, as it seemded to almost get corny with all of the twists and turns and chain of events. Too many times, he made the police look like idiots and skilled illusionist or not, you can only buy into so much trickery. I did enjoy all of the insight into the world of magic, but lost interest in the story line as it became more and more jumbled with what felt to be just filler. Deaver is awesome with his surpise endings and making the reader think one thing and then another, but this one was just too much. He went over the line of enough is enough.This of course won't scare me off of his books. I am a true fan and hope in this case, it was just me. :)"
5,Magic,This is a fabulously entertaining book. The reviews about the unrealistic nature of the plot are complete nonsense and miss the point. This is mystery and entertainment at its best. I have read all of Deaver's novels and The Vanished Man was definitely one of the best.
2,Deaver loses plot,"I'm with the other reviewer who gave this two stars. In Stone Monkey the 'surprise' bad guy was all too obvious because you know that's what Deaver does, but with the Vanished Man Deaver really starts to unravel. For me the story has to be crdible, and far too many scenes in this novel had me shaking my head in disbelief. He still writes in an enjoyable way, and his characters are still a little flat, but this had none of the tension of the Bone Collector and all the signs of someone who really is trying to be far too clever for his own - or his readers' - good."
5,Bravo!,"have been a total fan of Mr Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme since the first book, ""The Bone Collector"" but not since that first outting have I so throughly enjoyed one of his books. The story grabs you from the first chapter and does not let go until you close out the last chapter, which, I might add, delivers a one-two punch I never saw coming. The protagonist is complex and bone chillingly evil. BRAVO! I bought this book in a combo along with another book that I highly recommend ""HE NEVER CALLED AGAIN."""
3,This book exhausted me,"There were too many twists and turns and about-faces in the plot. And much of the plot was simply not realistic--I don't believed that even an accomplished magician could pull off some of those tricks. I agree with other reviewers that Deaver tried to manipulate his audience too much. Just give us a good story and don't try to trick us!The reason I gave the book 3 stars, however, is because I do like the cast of regular characters, and I enjoyed learning about the magic and more forensic stuff..."
4,Is the formula getting tired?,"I've enjoyed all the Rhyme-Sachs novels so far. This one seems a little tired in the begining, as if Jeffrey Deaver's just going through the motions. Things do pick up in the final chapters, but it might be time to shake the series up a bit."
4,Deaver weaves his magic again,"Jeffrey Deaver is an author who never disappoints when it comes to red herrings and misdirection. Simply put this is what makes his books so intriguing, because until you finish each book you never know what to believe is true.Appropriately, Deaver's newest book deals with a killer who uses slight of hand and misdirection to pull off some gruesome murders. Now I won't give up any plot points because that will only cheat the reader. But what follows is a cleverly plotted story which clears all the smoke and mirrors."
1,The Boring Man,"This one seems to be getting high praise, but I think those reviews must be from established fans of Deaver or the genre itself. I found this novel to be extremely boring. Yes, there's much research into forensics and the magic business, but the author tends to talk down to the reader, which I find annoying. One example would be the over explaining of the classic illusion ""Sawing A Woman In Half."" Is there really anyone out there who doesn't know the basic theme of this well-known magic effect?In what is otherwise very stiff text, Deaver attempts to make the characters sound more natural by throwing in way too many contractions (""or is"" becoming ""or's"") from every character. Contrived and distracting.Ridiculous turns of events and cardboard characters who all sound alike seem to be par for the course these days, but beyond that I just couldn't find anything of interest here."
3,A Nice Thriller,Although I did not enjoy this book as well as previous ones in the Lincoln Rhyme series it certainly was a fun read.
3,Too many twists and turns unnecessary and ruin an otherwise great read,"The Vanished Man starts out as an excellent fast paced , technically accurate account of an unusual murder case. I loved the ""posterboard"" of the evidence and clues involving the profile of the perpetrator. Perfect explanations of the instruments used to analyze evidence, beautiful development of the suspect, and classic following the directions given by the evidence.However, then the plot gets so involved, so outrageous, that after a while the credibility of the story loses its appeal. Too, too many nebulous connections and co-incidences. The original story line was just fine- crisp, taut, evidence oriented.. and then- just too bizzarre! Stopping about page 300 would have been a great idea! Keeping the reader engaged is one thing , but the game gets stacked totally against any odds of creating a level field for the reader and author to ""play"" together!"
3,inconsistant deaver,"great premise for a lincoln rhyme mystery but much of deavers story here is too contrived and not believeable. the bone collecter is one of my favorite books, but of his following books,"" the blue nowhere"" is the only one i care for."
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for some great Diabetic recipes. This magazine is by Better Homes and Gardens. It has a lot of ads and good information regarding diabetes. Like I said I wanted some good up to date recipes and there are very few in the magazine. I received my first issue in about 3 weeks after ordering it which I felt was great. Service was very good, just a little disappointed in the product. I will continue to read them and let you know if it improves."
1,Not Child Size. Not Even Close!,These gloves are for adults... no child hands could ever fit in them. I bought these gloves for my 5year old and it wasn't even close to fitting his hands. Not worth the cost. Total waste of money.
1,Is this meant for human hands?,"Given that it was very cheap and came very fast.... the quality of these gloves are so bad! The fingers are SO spread out so the stitching job was done horribly wrong. I can't believe this is for CHILDREN because as an adult it's big on me! The wrists are very loose and it's very plastic-y and uncomfortable. But hey, for a Halloween costume I guess it's not meant for any other useful purpose!"
2,too big,"Wow I know the package says they are gloves for children, but they're too big on me and I am in my 30's. They are far too big for my son. Under no circumstances are these ""child"" gloves. Not recommended that you buy them unless your ""child"" is a teenager on the large side."
2,Ridiculously large,Do not buy these gloves for a child. These gloves fit an adult hand. The quality seems reasonable and they're not wimpy although they've made of vinyl.
3,Way too big for my 5 years old,"These gloves fit my wife's hands, it's not for a 5 years old kid. Every thing else about it is OK, but he will not wear those for Halloween ... not this year anyway."
1,WAY TOO BIG!,These are not for a child; these are huge. I should have sent them back. Maybe I'll have to be Darth Vader next Halloween.
3,Classic Bava - budget disc,"As usual, Diamond delivers an interesting film on a budget disc.One of Bava's better films about victims in a small Transylvanian village, who are found dead with gold pennies coins planted in their hearts.Moody and stylish, with quite a few interesting sequences.Uncut and in LBX but pic quality is on par with $6.99, which means not great. As usual for Diamond releases, there are only 4 chapters. Decent value for money thpugh."
2,"Great film, very mediocre disc.","All the talk of VCI using the best elements available is absolute [bunk], seeing as this film was shown on television here in Australia recently in widescreen (1:85.1) and not 1:66.1 as exhibited on this disc (same goes for Blood and Black Lace). Hopefully Image will pick up this title soon and give it the treatment it deserves."
3,An excellent full-screen movie,"Once again, I have to rate the DVD by its' quality. This entertainment medium is ALL ABOUT great picture and fantastic sound. Although I appreciate the opportunity to see the Mario Bava movie, the DVD is not something that will excite your senses alone.The DVD runs smoothly so at least it has that going for it. One can assume that this is all there is left to publish for this particular movie, even though it came years later than Bava's first features.You will be treated to a couple beautiful women as a feast for the eyes. One is dressed up and one is dressed down. There is an older, spooky woman and of course the female child is unsettling to look at. The spooky village is dirty and old, and it has a wonderful cemetary set.Gee, I wish that I could have seen this movie when I was younger! It's a film that I'll play often."
1,wow.......................overpriced,Very overpriced for a movie that is available by anchorbay.................also isn't ilegal to sell cancelled dvd's i'm sure the studio will be upset........Hello Amazon..........
2,...,"... Video and audio quality are on par with VHS -- even the bonus trailer of ""The Night Visitor"" looks like a third-generation bootleg copy. Had I bought this at a gas station, I would have expected this kind of quality, but a serious DVD release tagetted at Bava fans should have more effort put into it. A total waste of the DVD format. Can't wait for someone else to release it so I can sell it. If you love Bava's work, you won't be disappointed by the movie, but I recommend you buy it used ..."
5,Media in your Life is Must Reading for Mass Com Students,"This book is an excellent introduction to mass media in America. It is one of the few attempts around to draw together a look at the various forms of mass communications--from MTV to the movies to the Internet. While intended for the college student, it also is a good reference for anyone seeking to understand the rapidly changing media landscape in America."
3,Inoffensive but lightweight,"Unlike the offensive Biography DVD, this product makes some small effort to come to grips with relativity, but could have done much more. The few animated examples (train and lightning, man in falling elevator) could have been better executed and better explained. The actor portraying Einstein did a reasonable job, but why the German accent?"
1,Strictly of Beginners,"I thought this product was a waste of time and money. It is a very amateur interview by someone who knows next to nothing about what he's talking about. The yoga teacher he ""interviewed"" was at least qualified and there was a demonstration that might be of some use to older beginners. However there was only about thirty seconds at the end discussing the history of yoga. To make it even worse, there were a couple of music interludes by a young woman who must be related to the producer."
1,"Do yourself a favor, DO NOT buy this book!!!","My son is a huge Harry Potter fan and is always looking for more information on the series. I thought this book would provide additional insite and it would be something he would enjoy reading. I read through the book and decided not to give it to him. This book is garbage. One of the chapters discusses the character Snapes similarities to the lead singer of a rock band which makes him appealing to females. I'm okay with that but when the discussion turns to how well endowed he probably is, I tossed it in the trash. This book is not for the typical Harry Potter fan."
1,"Adults only, self important, disappointing.","My personal disappointments are these:1. There are no warnings on the outside that this book is NOT suitable for underage readers.2. Many of the authors seem smug.3. I expect better commentary from this group of otherwise seemingly talented authors. What do I mean by ""better""? How about something that is really about the Harry Potter series instead of what these authors wish it to have been?4. How sad is it when the cover artwork far exceeds the book?I've read a lot of Harry Potter ""fan"" books. This is the only one that brought less than ten minutes of enjoyment. If you want this book, you can have mine."
1,NOT ONE MAP!!!,"This is the worst book I have ever read. Since there is not one map in the book, these people who wrote a collection of essays actually believe that a simple children's book requires someone to hold their hand in understanding a very simple story. There are one or two essays that are partially interesting. But most of the book is various inept authors that cant understand why they have not received the fame that Rowling has. So if you like to read about a bunch PHDs complaining misinterpreting and over analyzing, or you were confused by a children's story ... buy away."
5,great shirts,"All of these shirts are great shirts. They dont shrink, and the pictures are awesome. I have brought alot of these shirts for me and friends and love everyone one of these.Got all of the shirts before the delivery service time too.JB"
2,A little frustrating...,"This woman may have a great body, but she cannot teach dancing for anything. In the 35 minute 'cardio dance' portion, dance steps are taught frustratingly fast (and this is from somebody that enjoys dancing!). It took so long to figure out the steps--which are not your 'typical' exercise or step class steps--that I shut the DVD off and jumped on the treadmill.The two 15 minute hip and thigh workouts are a little better, but you really need to do them both back-to-back to feel any benefits. I would say this is a good video for anybody thats got LOTS of patience to learn the moves and an alternate workout for the first few times you run the DVD, because you'll get no benefit from the workout while trying to figure out what she's doing. Save your money!"
5,Great workout!,"The first day I did the cardio, I had a little trouble following it- but the next day it was no problem. I love the cardio matched with the ballet and yoga workouts. I had been using carmen electra's fit to strip volume 2- and this dvd blows that away. I immediately felt a difference with the ballet workout! If you have trouble at first, don't give up- it really is a great workout!"
2,down't waste your time and money,"I have been doing this work out for some time and it is not that great. It's too dancey I feel like I'm at a ""dance party"" but not in a good way. after I'm done working out my body doesn't feel any of it. Also the instructors motivations with ""you can do it"" and ""great job you"" are a bit annoying. Cindy's work outs are much better if you want something more effective."
3,Not for Beginners,"*UPDATE*: I HATE THIS VIDEO!!! ZERO STARS!!Like many of the other reviewers, the dance moves are really hard to follow. They also do weird close ups of the performers. Show me the moves not their faces. I wouldnt recommend this video for beginners, like myself. I was expecting something better."
1,Skin Damage,"Electronics on my 31 worked extremely well.After 20-30 running sessions, the 31 scrapes large sores into the skin on my chest despite using it in the way Polar describes. This has been the case each spring for the last 3 years when I've started retraining after winter. Fortunately, it sounds like my case is unusual.My chest is rather bony and about 44"" around. Routine use when running causes the transmitter to bounce up and down. The strap and stitching dig into, then break the skin. Initially, it looked like an allergic reaction. However, experimentation showed that it's abrasion, not allergies.The old HR100 chest strap worked much better. Polar did try to work with me on this and I commend them for their level of effort."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"I have used this chest strap for only a couple of months and it produces inaccurate readings all the time!! I am seriously disappointed with the inaccurate readings that I receive, and more importantly the fact that the monitor does not pick up a heart rate at all half the time. I would recommend against purchasing this chest strap...it may be slightly more comfortable than the hard chest strap, but the fact that the chest strap fails to pick up a heart rate, or in rare cases when it does, the fact that it is inaccurate makes this chest strap worthless. I am purchasing a new hard chest strap for use with my Polar HRM."
2,No active sports allowed,"I walk, bike, run and play volleyball and I mostly wanted to see how it worked for volleyball and it doesn't. I've made it as tight as I can and it just doesn't register with the jumping and moving associated with a highly active activity. Otherwise, it has been pretty consistent with walking, biking and running."
1,Over rated junk,"I bought the Polar RS800 and under a year the Ira (infra-red) capability to download to the laptop died. I have spent probably another $30.00 dollars in batteries just to rule out the failures.I called the manufacture who requires the ""original"" receipt before they will repair the unit. Instead I went out and purchased a competitor's solution which takes the signal from the heart monitor and transmits it to my iPhone.For over $300.00 I wouldnt touch another Polar product"
4,Very Happy,"Well pleased with comfort and accuracy of the transmitter. I use it with my rowing machine. Only complaint is the direction to twist the transmitter off the strap is not clearly marked. This is only a factor in the beginning, but after using it a few times it becomes a piece of cake."
2,Transmits poorly,"My husband has the old style Polar chest strap (battery not replaceable) and it works like a charm after 2 years. Mine only transmits a signal when it is in the mood. It reads my heart at 0 in the middle of an intense workout or randomly says it is over 200 when I am not even moving... or it will get stuck at a number. Then it will spontaneously start working again. When I use my husbands chest strap with my watch it works fine, so I know the problem is in the in the strap not the watch. It is a source of constant frustration. I have replaced they battery several times and follow all the instructions from Polar. It seems like moisture may be able to work into the battery chamber causing it to short? For an expensive piece of equipment to work maybe 20% of the time is a disappointment!"
2,Replaceable battery isn't,"The cover on the replaceable battery no longer is removeable. I've replaced batteries in the past without a problem. I've cleaned the gap between the cap and case, but no joy. The slot for inserting a coin or screwdriver has deformed and no longer provides any grip for turning the cover. I'm hesitant to reward them for a poor design by purchasing a replacement."
2,"Bulky, clumsy design","I bought a new F7 that came with this strap - however, I am very disappointed with the sheer bulk of the chest strap. I never had a real problem with the old style, so I may be biased here, but the new mechanism sticks out much further than previous models. Its pretty obvious that Polar will be improving this in coming years, as the mechanism itself is far too bulky. Poor, clumsy design."
4,More comfortable than previous version,"This HR strap has less tendency to slide down while running. It conforms to your chest better because the strap design is more flexible than the previous version. Snapping and unsnapping the chest strap is a little funky. It takes a little getting used to avoid getting the tabs jammed. Once you figure it out, it seems to work fine. The graphics (on how to snap/unsnap the strap) in the manual are not a lot of help."
2,Battery slot impossible to open,"The perceived benefit of the device was the replaceable battery. What an ordeal this was, even brand new. This is my second unit and resorted to drilling a hole in the back of the device to open. This flawed device needs to be re-engineered. The device will open but only with extreme measures."
5,buena compra,"excelente, muy buen producto, muy buen servicio, no tengo quejas. el producto cumple con todas las expectativas, que tenia muchas gracias."
4,"Works well, remember to wash often...","Works well, remember to wash often or it will stop working! Just wet the strap under a tap before placing around chest...hoping Polar comes out with a wrist strap cos not good trying to breath with being restricted."
3,comfort an issue,"So I had the old Polar transmitter; the one where you couldn't change the battery and other than the fact that you couldn't change the battery, it was great. I would wear it and not even know it was there. When the battery died I debated whether to just replace it with the same thing or to go with this newer version that lets you change the battery when it dies. Seemed like the latter of the two was a better choice economically over the long run so I went with it. It got here super fast and it works great but it is not comfortable. I find myself reaching up my shirt to adjust it at least twice every time I wear it. I have changed the band length to see if it was that simple of an issue but nothing seems to make it comfy. Having it is better than not having one at all but overall the comfort level is just not that great. I wish Polar would come up with one that is like the T-31(I think that is the name of the old one) but with the option of battery replacement! My two cents."
2,heart rate monitor,"Bought this to replace non coded transmitter that stopped working after 2 years. Belt is more comfortable but after wearing the transmitter 35 min. it stops working and needs to be dried off. This is always in the middle of my workouts. I haven't even worn it in the pool, not sure if it will even detect my heart rate if its submerged. Would not buy this product again."
2,Problems start when you replace the battery,"It works properly until you have to replace the battery. The cover is stuck, it is very hard to open it. After the battery was replaced, it gets stuck in the middle of the training, or give wrong pulse reading - very high or too slow.I consider not to replace it but buy the whole set from a different brand."
1,Polar Quality has Declined,I have lost my high opinion of Polar products. The last three transmitters I have purchased have either not worked at all or worked so sporadically that it was impossible to get a consistent reading. Lack of reading negated any valid results to flowlink. I've given up wasting my money on their products.
2,Not too good for me,"Polar should see a way of making a new model as comfortable and accurate as the T31 with a replacement battery! With this one I just can't get it to fit comfortably under my bra. Also a hassle to have to wet it before and after every use. I get erratic readings and have to keep trying to fit it several times during my gym workouts. Disappointed, if I can't get it to work properly soon (I will try wearing lower, backwards...), I am going to order a T31 coded so I am able to use it with my FT7 (previously I had a wonderful A5 -which I only decided to stop using because of the FT7 data storing capacity- that came with the T31 non-coded, but unfortunately it is not compatible with the FT7). Unfortunately when you purchase a new Polar model (such as the FT7) you have no choice because they only come with the Wearlink."
4,Replaceable battery an improvement,"I had to order this replacement transmitter when the battery in my old one wore out. The older model transmitter did not have a replaceable battery, so this to me is a great improvement. I'll be interested to see if it's water-resistant enough to keep out moisture from perspiration."
1,Polar WearLink bad investment,Unfortunately I was disappointed when this device didn't work with my phone properly. The device is great until it stops working in the middle of the workout. I spend more time trying to fix it during my workout then actually working out. Granted the supported devices do not include any of the three phones that I bought. In the end the device didn't do what I purchased it for.Don't buy it.
2,Just another disposable transmitter,"This transmitter is very comfortable. However the main problem arises when, just about over a year from the date of purchase, one has to change the battery of the unit. The lid does not open! One can easily turn the lid to the full ""open"" position; but, doing so does not produce the desired result at all. The lid remains locked and does not pop out! Good luck to anybody buying this unit thinking that he/she will be able to change the battery when it goes dead!The way the strap is connected to the transmitter is also poorly designed. Disconnecting the strap from the transmitter requires a lot of care so that breakage of the locking mechanism does not happen."
1,Disappointed,"Went to change the battery -after only a few good uses the reading became erratic, then non existent-; the coin -5 cent nickel coin as advised- wore out the indentation and it was impossible to open again. contacted polar cust svc. live chat were I was given the address of a repair shop in downtown LA."
1,Long Time Customer - Really Disappointed,"My experience with this transmitter and the FT80. I have used Polar monitors for years and I can't tell you how disappointed I was when the first ""improved"" transmitter stopped working. It worked fine for about 10 weeks. Then I started getting readings of 208 before even warming up. I would mess around with the belt and transmitter over and over to make it work - and it would sometimes for about 5 minutes - then back to crazy readings. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, replaced a 10 week old battery - same results. So I bought another transmitter here on Amazon only to have it do exactly the same thing after only 2 weeks. The product is bad because of the transmitter and you cannot use the older models with it so I am back to using my Polar F6 which has been bulletproof (and costs 1/4th as much). Polar - you really need to fix the transmitter problem on the new watches and provide us an alternative to the one flawed transmitter you offer."
2,Broken after 10 months,"Very comfortable, but from the start I felt uncomfortable about thatlatch. It was hard to open and made very strange sound, like breaking. I used the strap 2-3 times a week for a 1.5 hours. After 10 months I tried to open the left side to wash the strap and the metal button from the strap tore away."
1,Only replaceable if you can open it...,"The product worked great for a few months. When I went to replace the battery, I struggled to open the screw on the back. The plastic is so soft that even mild pressure strips it. I tried a screwdriver, coins, flat batteries... nothing works. Guess I should have just bought the ""single use"" version..."
4,Great Replacement to the Hard Rubber,"I bought this to replace the hard rubber one that came with my Polar RS100 a few years ago. So much for the 2000 hours or whatever the web site claims for the old non-replaceable battery. This strap has several advantages and a couple of things I didn't like.Likes:Very comfortableVery responsive to the watch0 interuptions or loss of signalEasy to washDislikes:The clip they use to attach around chest could be betterThe signal pod is bigger than the T-31The likes by far outweight the dislikes, but couldn't give a 5 star."
4,Good upgrade from the old style transmitter,I bought this to replace the old style solid transmitter. It's way more comfortable and the contacts are soft so they stay wet if you don't start your workout right away. Unfortunately the belt clips are starting to delaminate after about 3 months. The clip is still fine but it's looking ugly. Still better than the old units.
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH IPOD NIKE+,"I bought this to work with my iPod Nike+... but it doesn't. Not that it says that it would, but Amazon currently doesn't sell the kind that DOES work, so I guessed (incorrectly) that ""well, maybe this is the one that sync's with the iPod.""I'm sure it probably works great on it's own, but that's not what I bought it for.Nope."
2,2nd Polar WearLink,"I had to buy a new transmitter because it is impossible to change the battery. Once the cover is removed, you cannot put it back on. It is an extremely poor design. Other and the inability to change batteries, it works fine.I seriously considering getting rid of my polar HR Monitor when it is time to change the battery again."
3,Too difficult to replace the replaceable battery,"The batteries are unnecessarily difficult to replace. After sliding the slider to the ""Open"" position, the cover didn't simply pop off like it's apparently supposed to. After trying various things, what finally worked was to slide the tip of a sharp knife in and pry the cover off.Polar should consult one of the 5000 other companies which seem to have figured out how to make water-resistant screw caps that are easy for consumers to use."
5,Even better than the previous one,"It's really good even better than teh one I've lost, I use it under water and still transmiting ok.very good product"
1,Unreliable,"I bought a watch with this transmitter and soft strap and the strap lasted like 6 months. I have 3 old style hard straps, 1 from 1993, which still work perfectly. Wouldnt buy anything with the soft strap setup. Trying to find the other hard straps new or switch watch brand to another manufacturer. Had problems with my last 2 polar watches too. These are 2 expensive not to work perfectly."
1,Not a good buy,I purchased one of these less than a year ago. The electronics went crazy after about 10 months and changing the battery was no help. The mechanism for latching the belt around you consists of two separate loops of cloth into which a plastic hook is inserted. The first loop broke after several months and the second loop broke just when the electronics went nuts. With the loops broken there is no way to wear the belt. A poorly designed and poorly constructed product!
2,Good for about a year,"This strap came with my M61 Polar monitor. It is very comfortable but sometimes difficult to disconnect. The transmitter began to give erratic readings after about a year. Sometimes, after about 30 minutes of exercise, the readings would settle (it had nothing to do with being wet). I regularly cleaned the strap, but decided to clean all contacts too. No help. I replaced the battery. Still no help. I feel this strap is way too expensive to give only one year of usage!"
1,bad reception and high maintenance,"VERY HIGN MAINTENANCE. wash it THOROUGHLY after every use, soak it every time you use it so you look like you are breastfeeding. I bought a new strap (without transmitter) thinking the old one was past it, better but not much.I never had any trouble with the old strap, except when it came to the end of its battery life.The obvious solution to me is the old style strap with a replaceable battery.I only keep the polar now because I like the way it counts calories. I think the latest Garmin products have improved their method (it didn't count when you were on a static machine!!), so I might be looking there next time."
1,Performance not what I epxected.,Just another watch Heart Rate Monitor obviously made at a price. Didnt like the performamce and lost Heart rate when runnign hard. Thinknig of one attached tomy Android smart phone so I get GPS and voice feedback and isntant web connectivity. I think the Zephyr HxM may be next purchase
2,Not what I expected,"I only gave 2 stars, because this is not the book i thought it was, it took dayssssss to arrive, I paid for a ""un-returned"" book from a NY library, and the book was falling apart. Why 2 stars you say again??? because it was cheap - and that's what i got - CHEAP!"
2,"Too much fragrance, not enough absorbency",I typically purchase Huggies but decided to try these (my son liked the design!). Unfortunately the fragrance is completely overwhelming and the Pampers are not as absorbent. I will not purchase these again.
5,A very helpful book,"My husband is a very hard working pastor. He focuses more on other people than on himself. This book reminds him that he must spend time with God for himself first, then he can help others.A great find."
5,A Call to Action,"It is easy, when reading a book, to ""fall in love""with an author or the concepts he or she discusses in it. With most books, the ardour often dissipates within days of the reading. That will not be the case with The Contemplative Pastor. Peterson's depth of analysis will require repeated visits to drink in the wisdom on these pages. His diagnoses of the core ills facing the pastor and his flock are keenly insightful. His prescriptions for these sicknesses fit well with Scripture, and they sit well with my soul. This is a ""how-to"" book in the purest and best sense of the phrase. It is not a book of behaviours to imitate but an attitude to embrace. If we want to matter, all of us who have been called into service for Jesus must serve as thoughtfully, faithfully, intentionally, thoroughly, humbly and gracefully as God will empower us to do. Thank you, Eugene Peterson for that important reminder."
1,Text for Commissioned Lay Pastors (New Castle Presbytery) PC(USA),"This book is being used as a text in Pastoral Care class for Commissioned Lay Pastor students and graduates of New Castle Presbytery - PC(USA). Eugene Peterson is a favorite author and does not disappoint in this book. He dispels some of the most common myths about what a pastor should be and do, putting prayer at the heart of all action. I think this book is a most helpful addition to the library of any pastor and/or lay person who desires to minister effectively without ""burning out."""
5,not emo,"while many people will say this is an emo band they are not, they are power pop. it's a good cd with very catchy songs. there is not one song i do not like on the cd."
5,"Cartel, extremely underrated band","I heard of this band almost by accident, after putting a random play of music onto my shuffle, the song Runaway came on as I was talking a walk. The song came on by surprise, I didn't know I had it and I knew it was just an incredible band. The powerful vocals and solid instrumentals really deliver, and after listening to the rest of the CD I was hooked."
4,Good if it's what you're looking for,"Good lyrics, catchy guitar riffs, and a good singer. Very emo but you probably knew that already. If you're looking for a pop punk emo sound, a very good choice. Has somewhat of the generic pop punk band feel with an above average singer and great lyrics which makes them anything but generic."
5,Great CD!! wow I loved it,"I really did not like this band the first time I heard them. but I finally stoped being a loser and decided to hear the whole thing all the way through. I was honestly blown away by will pughs voice and could not believe how well that kid sings. The entire cd is awesome and fun to listen to you. They grab you and u just cant stop listening. I saw them live 2 weeks ago in atlanta at the masquerade and they were perfect. amazing vocals and great music. Im going to keep my eye on this band because they have something special. If I fail, settle down, and matter of time are the best songs on the cd... honestly their first single is awesome, but I just focus all the other songs more because thats important. everybody go get this cd and have an open mind when you hear it. Cartel is a great band, I dont care what you say"
5,Pop punk at it's best,"Cartel is keeping the pop-punk scene alive with catchy chorus's and a beat that just makes you want to bob your head along to every song. I highly recommend listening to anything by Cartel, not only this album."
1,Boring,"I couldn't get through the first story. I don't know if i just wasn't up for it at the time or what, but i was so bored i had to read something else and then i just deleted it (from my kindle)"
3,Pretty good stories,"The stories are pretty good - not super scary, but not too simplistic, either. My 8 year-old & I really enjoyed reading them together."
3,Ghost?,I'm glad I read this but it's not worth the price. If it had been free I wouldn't have minded too much. The stories were a little hard to follow and some left you wandering why it was included. Just not what I had expected for ghost stories.
3,Some good tips - but kind of slapped together,"Burton has some good advice and tips but I was really put off by the way the book is kind of slapped together. Very few of the projects he presents do you get to see finished - and as a result he comes off looking like a pretty mediocre carver. He's probably better than that but judging from the cover photo how can you tell? Have you ever seen a rams head that looks like that? Bad lighting for the photography and lack of a clear explanations give the impression of a rushed amateurish book. I give him a lot of credit for the practical and clever jigs and the home built carving table (plans would have been nice!) but boy, I could not stand carving in that plywood box he calls a studio for long at all...I'd go nuts."
3,Mediocre at Best,"Wile the author is very straight forward in his insistence that this book will cover the practical and not artistic side of carving (and he attempts to make a convincing argument for cutting corners wherever possible), it's fairly obvious that the latter eludes him after flipping through a few pages. It is hard for me to take anything he writes very seriously when I would be embarrassed, as a rank amateur, to show the pieces discussed. Combined with the fact that very little true architectural carvings are covered instead focusing on the more mundane aspects of the craft (like building a workshop, selecting tools, safety, etc.), it would be hard for me to recommend this piece to anyone."
3,A Hoot and a Half!,"What we have here has been concocted to resemble the first three episodes of a 30-minute TV series aimed at pre-teens and teenagers. The plot is simplicity itself--- four ""hot teenagers"" protect the planets of our galaxy from the devious schemes of the evil Lord Doom. The ""series"" borrows stop motion animation from at least three different movies, and some giant monster footage from yet a fourth.Acting ranges from wooden to excellent. You can see some of the inexperienced actors searching for their floor marks as they walk on set. The main inspiration, apart from STAR WARS and STAR TREK, seems to have been the Toho Studios 30-minute series beginning in the 1960s with ULTRAMAN. The Planet Patrol fights a lot of giant monsters, in other words! If you can mentally make yourself 10 years old again (I can, effortlessly), then you will love this. Otherwise, give it a miss, infidel."
2,i dont like it.,This is one of the worse dvd i have ever watched...It looks childish but some part can be entertaining.yeah really
5,Beautiful Film,"This is definitely an attractive movie from the characters, shading, textures, setting, and story standpoint. I must stress that the colors, particularly, stand out remarkably for a 1942 production. Though there are no magical elements in this narrative, if you enjoy the period with its architectural and clothing splendor, then this is the ticket."
3,Not the 'Thief of Bagdad',Not by a long shot. Actually quite boring in spots. Nice to look at but not as much of the type of fantasties I am used to from this period.
5,Wonderful Escapist Fun,"Maria Montez finally on DVD -- and better late than never! The Queen of Universal Technicolor in the 40's, this beauty starred in a slew of films that showcased her good looks in scanty harem wear more than her acting ability. A late show staple for years (and inspiration for generations of gay men), Montez is unknown to many current film fans. But it's hard to imagine anyone, from the kids to Grandpa, not getting a kick from her movies, and ARABIAN NIGHTS is a fine place to start investigating. Full of breathless action, corny comedy, epic romance, and eyepopping color, it's ideal Saturday afternoon fare. Grab some popcorn and hunker down for a great time."
3,A well presented oriental adventure...,"After her adoring audience had grown up, they discovered that Maria Africa Vidal de Santo Silas (born 1920, died 1951) hadn't done her own singing (she was dubbed), nor her own dancing; her ability as an actress was also put into question, but her spell was not tarnished...Maria Montez was still the madly glamorous South American 'Queen of Technicolor'. What her roles (all of them variations of Scheherazade) required were ingredients she had a surplus of: statuesque bearing, regal demeanor, fiery beauty and, best of all, an unassailable confidence in herself... When one weighed all the things she couldn't do against the thing she did so well, the balance came out in her favor...Her film, ""Arabian Nights,"" is a well presented oriental adventure which has nothing to do with its source material but entertained multitudes in search of relief from total war and was followed by several vaguely similar slices of hokum with the same stars..."
2,You have to be dedicated....,"to Wolfe to get much out of this compilation. This covers a lot of his early journalism pieces. Though they are well-crafted, the people and groups he describes are not that interesting anymore. Maybe in the 70's, they were.... but really, considering all that has transpired in the US since, the complex and quirky personalities, movements and clubs described just don't have much surprise anymore. Many of the pieces just made me wonder why am I reading about this? If you are interested in his work, you would be much better served to read ""The Right Stuff,"" ""A Man In Full,"" and ""Bonfire of the Vanities."" In those, the same style and research is applied to people that operate within an interesting context and story arc."
4,Dazzling concept!,"This is the kind of book that makes you want to read more, both of the trilogy itself and of the author. The story was a bit confusing in the beginning but I soon became riveted to my comfy reading chair and couldn't put the book down. The people in the book are believable and the story is great and colorful. I really look forward to reading more of the Deities of the Vales and beyond."
4,Another wonderful read from Duncan. Went straight for volume 2!,"His worlds, civilizations and characters never cease to astonish me. The story reels you in page by page, and then you find yourself surrounded by war, magic, religion, and pure human experience."
4,A nice book,My children really liked this version of Red Riding Hood. They enjoyed the CD telling them the story. However I also purchased the Goldilocks and the three bears and I haven't received it is too bad they are expecting this book. Congratulations to the author.
5,"This ""Dance of Utter Darkness"" is a true literary delight","Cynthia Gralla is a fabulous new voice in fiction. The novel draws the reader into Liza's world of beauty and image, risk and reward. Beautifully written, Gralla's work calls to mind the lyrical and visceral prose of Ondaatje's English Patient, exotic and richly-spiced, with the intelligence and historical framework reminiscent of Nabokov or Durrell. The reader comes away changed, as though Liza's journey into her own ""dance of utter darkness"" had served as a scrying mirror in which one could divine those things hidden and secret within us all."
1,poorly written but interesting subject,"It is too bad the poor writing - from poor grammar to incorrectly used words - diminishes a very interesting subject. I could not make my way through this book due to the terrible writing. The writing hinders understanding of what the author is trying to say - sometimes causing really confusing scenes and descriptions. She needed a good editor or ghost writer to help her.The content of the book, however, is fascinating - and the author has apparently done her research into Japanese dance and culture. I would have loved to be able to read about this ""floating world"" but just couldn't make my way through the poorly constructed sentences and quirky, trite (if nonsensical) descriptions.Too bad."
5,More than a rant!! Much more.,"Very slim book. A quick read. In just a few pages Miller successfully presents the comprehensive problem of dealing with something that outsiders perceive as being so easy--just get rid of that guest of yours.Well, Miller had made an obligation, and knew what it mean to be needy. So, how does one simply say, ""GET OUT!""? But more exciting is Miller's ability to give a sober, fair representation of the rude guest. It would have been so easy & bratty to present the guy as thoroughly rotten; but Miller gains credibility as an artist by delineating the complexity of a condition.So, I disagree with a previous reviewer who took this book as a rant. No, no. Miller makes a huge effort to be fair to his nemesis. Rants are one-sided and uninteresting."
5,"A superb rant, very wry, a sardonic masterpiece","From page one of this book Henry Miller exacts his revenge on his unwelcome houseguest. This book is a superb rant, filled with some of Henry Miller's most brilliant and amusing caricatures. Henry Miller deftly swings between sweet admiration and praise for the object of his troubles, and outright disgust. Set in Big Sur, later in his life, it's a short, easy read, and doesn't contain the profanities that cause some people shy away from in Henry Miller's books. Highly Recommended for those who want to laugh out loud at Henry Miller's audacity and want to better understand HM's genius."
1,Not Reliable,1)It doesn't support US Time zone.2) It doesn't work at the maximum network speed of 100 mbps. The max speed I get on this device is 28 mbps.3) If you copy a directory that contains lots of small files...the unit freezes up sometimes.4) If you stress the unit too much by copying too many files over a long period of time....it freezes up. This becomes evident when I'm performing a 80-100 GB backup through backup software.5) Noisy Fan.6) Bad Customer support.7) No patches in the customer support page.I don't recommend buying at all.
2,there has to be a better way,"I loved the idea of this product, but was so sad to discover it must use a ""overlay"" to work correctly, which means if something goes wrong you will loose all of your data, and good luck recovering it, it also is very intermittent in its operation and not fast enough for streaming video what so ever.I spent well over 100 hours tweaking, and rebooting to no avail, it is now in my ""junk box"" oh well perhaps the more expensive ones work."
1,Really Poor Quality,I ordered this unit and could not even get it to turn on. Do not touch this garbage.
4,A must buy for beginners,"I just started tying flies a couple of months ago and have been learning the basics by reading instructions for beginners on the Internet. After having read this book and followed it's instructions I feel much more confident in my fly-tying. The author does a terrific job at explaining the basics of fly-tying and the photos and illustrations are top-quality. This book is clearly intended to be a ""beginners guide"", and as such it does a terrific job. The only drawback, in my opinion, is the heavy emphasis on tying dry-flies. Here in Iceland, we don't use them a lot, but if you're looking for a great guide to tying dry-flies, here it is! Overall, a must buy for the beginning fly-tyer."
1,Terrible,This card had the worst range I have experienced. I am using it in conjunction with the matching Trendnet Router. I have 4 year old wifi cards that work better then this card.
5,Quick Wireless,"Love this for my laptop. replaced a USB wireless connector which was bulky and using precious ports. Install was quick with CD, connection is superb at the max rate, and worth every penny of the $50ish I paid."
1,Good vendor,The product does not work well. It loses connection frequently even when 2 feet from the router. Would not recommend it.
1,Did not work for me on RedHat or Xubuntu Linux,"I've been using Linux for about 12 yrs now, but I could not get this card to work on RedHat 5.5 or Xubuntu 9.04 Linux. I've downloaded and tried the drivers from Trendnet and Ralink, but received errors with both. I'm going to continue to try to make it work with RedHat 5.5 on an Pent4 machine and hopefully it works soon, or i guess I'm going to have to return it. I don't use MS Windows at home.Right now the error is dpm.o is not formatted correctly."
2,Not for wedding flowers ideas !!,"I was looking for a wedding flower book to help me pick the flowers I would like to put in my bouquets. This books does not have a large variety of different colored flowers. They are very simple bouquets. The flower girl flowers were very large and massive not simple and elegant. I didn't really care for the selection of flowers and how they were coordinated in the the bouquets, but we all a different taste so maybe this could be the book for you."
1,Canola Oil,"I came across this searching for Paleo-friendly products on Amazon. ""Canola"" oil is NOT Paleo. Admittedly, the product does not specifically advertise as Paleo, but really, canola oil is very unhealthy. Skip this and ask for Wilderness Family to re-stock their mayo."
5,Ojai Lemonaise is the BEST!!!,I love this product (Ojai Lemonaise) and have been using it for years. My family loves this product. I use it to make tuna salad and chicken salad sandwiches. Or anything I would use plain ol' mayo for. Our favorite is to mix it in with a little melted butter for artichoke dipping. Yummy! The only thing I hate is having to order it and have it shipped.
2,"GMO Canola oil, no good!",This product comes off as natural but let's not forget people that canola oil is a horrible oil. And if it isn't stated as non-GMO than IT IS.
2,blah for the bucks,"...after paying the shipping the item cost over $11.00That would be perfectly OK if the lemon-mayo gave a different little ZING! to things I would normally use mayo for. However, tastewise I didn't care for it, but I thought..oh that's just me. Then my DH said ""Ohh.h.h..h I dont even like the way it smells.""That's too bad, I love mayo and I love lemon, but this product didnt have an appeal to either of us.Finishing with something GOOD to say..it arrived speedily and I love the label..it's an attractive label."
5,Excellent,This was a great product. The materials are sturdy and my boyfriend loved it! The rubber grip is good and not too rigid.
4,Clapton!,"Great album, Layla (original version), Key to the Highway Blues, more great music. Bought as a gift for me Da who called me asking who did this ""song about a highway and keys, long song"". As an aside, a Satellite radio for an older parents (70+) vehicle will lead to many of these types of calls at odd hours of the night. Clapton never changes, always great music, Me Da calls me every time Key to the Highway comes on!"
4,Kenko's Time-capsule: A Cultural Survey,"Anyone interested in or studying Japanese history/literature/culture should read this book. It contains a series of short essays (zuihitsu) and reads much like Sei Shonagon's Pillow Book. These essays range from Kenko's moral opinions about various aspects of life to his aesthetic tastes and thoughts about beauty. These essays are Kenko's opinion, yet they can be taken as the opinions of Japan's society at the time of the writing. Therefore there is a great deal of interesting cultural information and meaning behind Kenko's words. So if you are interested in Japanese Buddhism or religion, this book's a must.If you are interested in Japanese aesthetics- aware: the idea that beauty is transient/fleeting, wabi-sabi: by becoming aged and through use, an object's history and experience bestow upon it greater value than an object that is new, the idea that uncertainty/non-uniformity/ and incompletion can inspire imagination- by all means read this."
3,My error with this purchase,"I originally studied this book in college and loved it, and bought it this time for a friend. My mistake was not checking who translated this edition, as it is quite different from mine. I prefer the translation by Donald Keene, as it is more whimsical and meant for everyone to understand."
1,Wrong advertised translator,"The Kindle edition is a translation by Sansom, not Keene as indicated by the Amazon description. Not what I wanted or expected."
4,This series is moving along nicely...,"If you like action/violent anime, this is your ticket. I like how heroes and villians alike explain a bit about their pasts. Another reviewer complained about 'overly long back stories' but I guess he doesn't know that anime is KNOWN for rich storytelling. This installment has a pretty even balance of action and story which, to me, gives the viewer a better handle on why the characters are at odds with each other. The animation quality is the same as the 1st dvd(slightly better than average) but I just love the character designs. No problem with the English dub in my opinion either. Want your samurai action anime fix? Grab this one."
2,It's hard to sense Samura in this.,"Foremost, imho, the discussion between Samura and his editors is well worth the price of this, and they express not so positive views on this adaptation.Beginning credits end with Manji against a...contemporary highrise background?Characters walk as if robotic toys; their running disturbed, jarring.Starved ambiant soundtrack, when not illtimed, heavyhanded rock (the appearance of Giichi triggered an unfortunate laugh).Facial movements are wooden, mouth movement derived from a lesser ventriloquist technique, the voicework formulaic, unimaginative - the sound of Rin's cries, as Manji falls ill to Shizuma's poison, channeling Luanne of Mike Judge's King of the Hill.Samura's shifting viewpoints inject more contemplation/ambiance than the slow pans employed here. And, possibly the use of a narrator would have tempered overlong and explanatory character monologues."
4,lovely voice,Cory Sipper came to my college and sang. I must say she has a beautiful voice. I really loved the song she sang called Dragonfly. She was great.
1,This book is terrible,I have never read such a bad book. This was such a self serving pat-myself on the back kind of book
2,Not the definitive Photographer's Guide for Photoshopers,"I am always searching for good books that cover the subject of digital photography and Photoshop. I thought this book was it, but it came up short. There were some good sections, even for the intermediate and expert level, but the majority of it is basic information. Few of the techniques were useful, but most of them were amateurish and not really used in professional photography. The makers of Andromeda filters must have sponsored this book in some fashion as there is a whole chapter dedicated to these filters. Again, most of these filters are not useful in real world applications. Overall I was disappointed in this book."
3,Decent on some levels,"I bought this at the same time as I got Barry Huggins' Photoshop Retouching Cookbook. While Busch's book has more information, and i am sure it will prove useful, I was a bit disappointed in the caliber of sample photos. All the pics were underexposed, grainy or just plain superficial. Unlike Huggins' book--which contains pics that are beautiful and clear.I'm only on page 76 of reading Busch's word-for-word, and I've done the sample exercises with the accompanying CD. So far, I've found TWO errors. One on page 75... in regards to vignettes. The instructions leave out a necessary step (drawing the marquee on a separate layer). Same with page 76--it instructs you to start with a b&w; image and bring up hues/saturation box. This is impossible to do with grayscale photos, so you have to convert to RGB mode first, a step that is not included in the instructions.I hope there aren't too many more missing steps throughout the pages."
3,Very basic information,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I read through it once, learned one or two things, then was done. Much of the information was ridiculous, and not at all applicable to photographers now.It's a good read for beginners, but not a true reference book."
3,Good but not good enough,"It's not a bad book. It has a few things worth looking at but if you're looking to seriously improve your photography using PS, then keep looking. Photos used through out the book are old and it seems they were scanned on a ship flatbed scanner."
3,Not enough info for the money,"This book is for beginners only. There is no room for growth. Only the basics are covered and they are the basics that you should already know from just looking around the internet; i.e. color curves, sharpening, clone tool, etc.This book has been updated for photoshop 7 from a previous book and it looks as though the example photographs were taken in the '60s and '70s with a lomo. Ok, not that bad and it does not directly effect the photoshop information, but it is nice to see something pleasant along with some good info for [the money]."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible","If you are looking to protect your TomTom One, stay clear of this so called ""clear"" screen protector. This overpriced piece of foggy plastic actually makes your screen look like a computer screen thats been baking in the sun. The size isn't even correct. It is too small and leaves about an 1/8"" on each side exposed, which makes the screen look even worse. And forget about getting a reply from customer service when you want to return this piece of junk. It's been a week and still no reply. Stay away from this screen protector, and stay away from Boxwave."
2,You need to protect the screen.,"You need to provide some sort of protection for the screen and this does the job. However, it certainly is not worth the price. Any piece of clear plastic even plain ordinary plastic wrap can be used. The glare protection is worthless. If the sun hits your TomTom you can't see the screen no matter what. Save your money."
2,"Likely to break, and quickly...","As other have mentioned, the think plastic forming the ""latch"" simply doesn't hold up to the kinds of forces exerted on it. Expect it to break. Aside from that, it's a great case...solid, sleek (if a little bulky), and convenient. But unfortunately, if it doesn't stay closed it kind of defeats the purpose.I'd avoid it. I returned mine, and have no desire for another."
2,Great case - lousy catch,"I've had 2 of these and love how durable these are. I tend to drop it and it gets bounced around in my purse. It's all scratched up but my Palm is perfectly protected. If the manufacturer would make a better catch I would rate it 5 stars. The catch is basically a little plastic ""nub"" that fits into the right side of the front cover. It broke on my first one because someone didn't know how to open it and forced it apart. It broke after a few months on my second one with normal use. Because it is great protection, I just put a wide rubber band around it. That makes to a pain to open, but it works for now."
1,"Case latch breaks easily, so case isn't worth half it's price","Many people here are commenting that the latch on this case is its Achilles' heel, and I'll testify to that too. We had our first one replaced because the latch broke after a few months, and then the latch on the second one broke after a few more months.Now my wife uses a hair elastic to keep it closed. I guess it is still better than nothing, but I wouldn't pay for one of these cases."
2,"Tungsten E hard case, OK ,but not what it could be","Got the case even after the other reviews about access to sync cable, exp card, and on-off switch. These are easy to work around. The two concerns I had are.1) Loose fit, PDA can bounce around inside of case. Added foam tape, along top and bottom,inside cover to give it slightly snug fit.2) My hinge pin broke, and it's only 1-1/2 weeks old."
1,Very disappointing,"The Palm will rattle within the case even when properly placed. Also, there is no ready access to the on/off button, stylus, synch port or charger when the Palm Tungsten is in the ""normal"" position in the case. If this wasn't bad enough, the case is difficult to open. Palm should go back to the design studio and get it right."
1,Screen Cracks if you Push On Case!,"I bought this case because I take my Palm with me everywhere and I thought the hard case would keep it safe. Unfortunately the hard case CAUSED my screen to crack!Here is why: On the inside, opposite the screen, are brackets for keeping extra memory cards. They stick out higher than the rest, so if you push on the case from the outside, they go right into the screen and crack it! It doesn't take much presure either.Palm does not consider this to be a design defect and won't pay to fix the damaged screen. If you buy this case, be very carefull not to let anything ever push against it. Actually, you may want to consider a protective case for the protective case!"
2,Too big (and does NOT look like the one in the picture),"The only thing this case does well is protect the Tungsten E like an armored car. That's it; everything else sucks. The palm rattles when it is inside (i.e. it does not fit snugly). You cannot reach the power button or get the stylus without having to lift the palm out of the case. The photo of the case that shows in amazon and everywhere else suggests that the case has an opening in the top right corner for easy access to the stylus, but this is not true, at least not here. Basically, I wish they made a case like the old palm hard case for the palm Vx...just a simple hard case that opens easily, protects the palm, allows for easy access to the thing and all the needed buttons, and, most importantly, does not add bulk. Until some intelligent designer gets this done, this case is good enough to protect my palm while it jumps around in my briefcas."
3,Does the job but not a great case.,"This product is alright but the case I had for my Palm V was a lot better. Unfortunately, the outside of the case doesn't seem to be a very strong metal so when I toss my keys into my purse it gouges the case. Also, the case doesn't ""lock"" shut very well so when I accidentally dropped my Palm the case popped open. In addition, the case is a bit awkward to use when using my Palm and when charging the case sort of gets in the way. Like I said in my title, the case is doing the job but not what I was hoping for."
4,Great case..........almost,"This case for my Palm E2 is well made and delivery was super prompt. My only caveate lies with its overall thickness which I thought would be less than it is, said dimension due to the storage slots for memory cards. Maybe another possibility exists out there, but, until I find it, this one will due."
3,Good but limited,I bought this case for my wife who uses and abuses her Palm Pilot all the time. She has found it sturdy and has not had any problems opening it. Only drawback so far is hot-sincing is more difficult because the port is not as accessible.
4,needs a belt clip,"The hard case really protects, but sure could a way to attach to my belt or pocket."
3,Mixed Review,"Greetings..Been a user of PDA's for awhile.. and I think the E is a great device. I am a landscaper, so I need a good case for my palms.. But I am also always very aware of where the palm is when I am working. I keep it in my back pocket so it pretty much stays outta harms way. So i bought the hardcase to keep it safe BUTThe SD hard holders left scratch marks on my writerite screen protector, which leads me to beleive that if you take a hard hit with this case, it would break your screen.... sooo i'm sticking with the flip cover that comes with my device.. I figure I don't care about scratches at all.. only the screen.. sooo thats my two cents"
1,Doesn't hold it,"In order of their appearance: (1) dangerously slippery surface, can literally slip out of your hand (2) unit slides off of slide-on bar when tilted (3) case catch stopped working at 2 weeks without any trauma, so it constantly gapped open in my purse. At the time, there were no alternative cases so it at least protected the unit (poorly) for a while. I threw this waste of money away."
2,Nicely functional but poor quality,"I really have loved this case from a functional point of view. It nicely protected my much loved Tungsten E, but after only five months of use, the latch is broken and the case will not stay closed. This is a real disappointment as it met my other criteria for a good case."
2,"Sleek look, but doesn't live up to rep","I bought this case because I needed something sturdy to protect my Palm inside my purse. It's sturdy and sleek, a little bigger than other cases, but I was willing to make that trade for protection. But after just four months, the clasp broke and now the case pops open inside my purse, subjecting my Palm to the ravages of keys, combs and various whatnot. This is not good. I am extremely disappointed. I used a leather case on my last Palm and, although it got beat up, it never broke! Depending on your needs it may be best to stick with a tried and true solution - leather."
1,Badly Designed Case,"This is a very poorly designed case, and I would encourage you to look at alternatives before spending your money. The problems I have with the case are:1. The palm does not fit snuggly inside the case and tends to rattle around. I had to glue a piece of foam inside the front cover to stop the rattle.2. You cannot get the stylist out, even when the case it open. The edge of the back cover blocks you access to the stylist, so that you must balance the palm between the front and back to retrieve the stylist. Very, very annoying.3. The case muffles alarms so that they cannot be heard. I've just missed another appointment, so I'm going out tonight and buying a new case with slots for the speaker."
1,Hard cover for Plam Tungsten E,Two hard to hold and try to do anything I am going to look for a leather one soon!
4,Perfect!,"Wanted to protect my new PDA - this is perfect, a little bulkier than I would have liked, however I can toss it in my purse or bag and not worry about damaging it....or turning it on and running the batteries"
3,Great if you're rough; Bad for convience,"Good points:- This case will take a beating and completely cover the Palm. This is what I was looking for. This is coming from someone who broke his Palm V because it was in my pocket during a fierce game of volleyball.Bad point:- It prevents easy access to the power button & stylus; the locking mechinism broke, it is bulkly and it shakes & rattles around while in the case.Conclusion:- After my volleyball error, I purchased another Palm V and brought the aluminum case that goes with it. It was durable, compact, and easy to access. I was hoping to find a cover that did the same for the Tungsten, but to no avail."
2,"Great case, poor quality","This case is really slim and protects my Palm well. I keep it in my purse, so I needed something to protect it from getting banged around.The case somewhat blocks the on/off button and the hot sync connector, but it is a simple thing to work around.My big gripe is that after 4 months of use, the top hinge connector went wacky (it used to spring in and out, and now it just falls in and out) and the case now falls apart when I open it. I have not dropped it, so I'm not sure why it broke (another reader suggested that dropping it might be the cause).I love this case, but I'm not going to buy another one to replace it -- too expensive to replace every 4 months. I'm going to try a slim leather case instead."
1,Didn't hold up at all,"I had a RhinoSkin hard case for my old Palm Vx that saved it from several drops. When I got my new Tungsten E I knew I HAD to have a good hard case. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this one. After a few drops, the connecting post broke off from the case. Accessing the on/off button and stylus is a pain. The only good feature that I don't see in other is the double hinge that allows the case to fold back, but I won't get another one of these. I am in the market for a more durable case!"
1,An Inadequate Product,"The surface of the case is alarmingly slippery.The expansion card ""holders"" do not hold. Theextra expansion card I had just purchased isgone; slipped out of the ""holder"". ka-ching!More money down the drain. Now, after a whoppingthree weeks of use, the case does not clickshut at all.The only good thing about this case is that itis still protecting my Tungsten E somewhat.As soon as I find a decent case elsewhere, it'sgoing in the trash."
3,"Protects well, but latches broke.","This protection is excellent for taking care of your Tungsten E. My palm does not fall out of the case ever, and I don't find that turning it on, hot syncing it, or powering it is a problem. For the hotsync, you just open the case and plug the sync into the bottom of the unit. With this case, I am able to keep my palm in my back pocket and even to sit on it without any problem whatsover. I have dropped it several times with no consequence.Unfortunately, 3 weeks after I bought it, the latch on the side broke, so the case does not stay shut. I either use a rubber band to keep it shut, or just keep it in my pocket. It's still good, but not perfect."
4,apples and oranges,I just got this case and am very happy with it. The things listed in the other reviews are an issue if you're looking for a different type of case. However this one is great for the type of design that it is.It completely encloses around the device so the stylus and the hotsync plug are not accessible when it's closed and you do have to lift it out a little to get to the stylus and to plug it to the charger and to do a hotsync but that's just the design of the case. I have no trouble opening it with one hand. One thing that i was a little concerned about before buying was about the lid. I was concerned as to whether it would be ontrusive or not but it folds all the way back behind and out of the way. This is a great case if it's the type of case you are looking for. But if you're looking for something just for easy access then it's probably not the case you want. No other case would offer as much protection though.
2,"Sucks, falls apart.","When you look at the pic, your think solid titanium. Try slightly hardened plastic. I have had this case for a little more than a month and it is falling apart. The hinge keeps detaching and can't be fixed. Screws become dislodged and will forever remain squeeky. I am afraid to open it for fear and screw may come out and I will lose it permanently. The plastic bends and dents easily. Once I dropped the case and it popped open and the SD Card popped out onto the floor. It is lucky I got this for free with my Tungsten E or I would be severely mad at spending $40 in a store. The price on this site is better and more reflects the value of the case. Should be a little lower still! :-("
4,Palm hard cover,My husband bought a Palm and a soft cover. He keeps it in this shirt pocket and it cracked within a couple of weeks. I replaced the Palm and chose this hard cover. His Palm is still in good condition. The hard cover is dented in a few places but his Palm is safe.
1,Disgruntled,"I'd like to thank reviewer ""An electronics fan from New York, NY USA"" for the advice to call Palm Corporate. Unfortunately, I called today and was blown off after a long conversation. I was told there is NO warranty on Palm assessories and to go buy a new case. This is my second Palm Tungsten e hard case and each has broken within 40 days. Unfortunately amazon.com will not return if defect is not within 30 days. Do Not Buy This Case unless you have tons of $ to waste. It WILL break at the clasp no matter how gentle you are with it. Zero star rating for product and company."
1,it crashed my tungsten e,"When I first get this I thought ""this is what I need"", but then it hit me that this item didn't have a clip to secure it on my belt or pants, so I had to wear it on my shirt pocket but it kept falling (fortunately the PDA didn't break because of the case), so I had to put it in my pants back pocket. After wearing it many times, once I sat and apparently the LCD screen pressed the expansion card clips and the screen broke so my palm is now useless. I'm very dissapointed and I strongly reccomend to bear this in mind when buying it"
1,Not what I had in mind,"I used a Palm Vx for many years, and it was always in the Palm hard case. I had hoped for a similar product. Alas, this case is far too big - most especially too wide - to begin to imagine carrying it around with the flexibility I was used to with the Palm Vx. I am now off to explore the competitors, and hope they are narrower. Frustrating."
3,It Looks Good,"The price was right and it looks stylish but I find it just a little bit too large for my pocket, hard to open quickly and hard to access the PDA on/off switch and stylus once opened. Other than that, it is okay. For my needs, I would have been just as happy with another faux leather flip cover."
2,Fragile clasp,"Everything about this case is great except for one thing. After two months of use, the clasp that holds it shut broke apart from both sides. The case is still usable, but I just have to be even more carful now."
4,I really really like it!,"I bought this case the day after I bought my TungstenE and found that I didn't like the flap cover. I really really like this case! I don't what people are doing with it to their to break the hinges and to have it fall apart! I can use one hand to open the case and flip the cover backwards to read e-books daily. I've also dropped it a couple of times, once on gravel in the street and it held up well.Only things I wish for in this case is for access to the headphone, miniUSB and power jacks. Other than that, it serves what it does for me."
1,Hard case does not fit Tungsten E2,"Contrary to what the description says, this case is not designed for the E2. The guides for the mem card slots on the inside cover interfere with the handheld's metal case, preventing proper closure. If you apply pressure and force it to latch it is almost impossible to open."
1,Palm case is CLUMSY,DON'T BUY THISI hate this case. I had a hard case for my Palm Vx and this one is a big step backwards.The case is too large - it unnecessarily thick - and much larger than I expected.It is really difficult to turn on the palm and get at the stylus by simply opening the lid. I have to not only open the lid - I have to also swing the back of the case away from the PDA.This case was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.
3,Cost too much!!!,"Way too easy to open. No padding at all so the PDA is free to slide up and down and front to back, not good when it's in a hard case. Also not sure how long the TINY latch will hold. Tried putting padding in it but by the time you get it to stop rattling you can't close the lid very securely. It should have a sliding latch to open for the price you pay. It looks nice but it's built like it's made in China (and it is)."
5,Great product! Fast. Safe. Useful.,"The Hard Case for my E2 was my first purchase on line. I was looking for a secure site to find what I needed, and I finally found it! The Hard Case is just great! I received it in perfect conditions and, most important... ON TIME! Now I have it, my E2 is grateful with me, his owner!"
3,Serves its basic purpose,"The Palm hard case for my Tungsten E2 serves its basic purpose to protect my PDA, especially during business travel. Pros: Easy to slide PDA in an out of the case, easy access to use the screen while the PDA secured. Cons: Can't easily access on/off button on the top of the PDA while in the case lying flat, difficult to sync to my computer while the PDA is in the case (it's do-able, but very awkward), and I sure wish the case closed securely with more of a snap...kind of a mushy clasp functioning when you close it. However, the case provides much better protection that just the suede cover flap that originally came with the PDA."
2,palm holding case,"This is a very sturdy case, but I find it a little tricky to get the Palm situated in it and close it shut so it doesn't accidentaly open on me in my purse. Sometimes it gets knocked by other items close by and it opens up. It needs a better designed locking/closing system to it."
5,Fun romance!,Enjoyed reading this romantic and fun book. Great relatonship between the sisters and between the single dad and his daughter. Also a good depiction of the strains and rewards a troubled child can bring to everyone around them. I'll definitely read the remaining books in this series!
3,Family,"I enjoyed reading the book as light summer reading. It really had little substance, and I would not recommend it."
4,Book,"Book was in good conditon, packaged well, received in a very short period of time, haven't read it yet but I am looking forward to it soon."
4,PC DVR Net,"This PCI card is installed inside your computer. Your computer must have Windows XP or 2000, but the system requirements on RAM and processor speed are overly strict. I am running this card on a 650 MGHZ HP with a mere 56 MB of RAM. It's obviously sluggish if I play back multiple cameras, but it records just fine. I also bought a pair of SWANN Bulldog cameras for outside, and 2 of the SWANN wide angle cameras for my garage and tool shed. This combo works great for me.Otherwise, I agree with everything RY said in his review, especially about the need for a 10X fast-forward on playback. Regardless, the card works like it's supposed to, and the price is hard to beat."
1,Bad Company Return,I purchased this product and when received discovered it was not for a 64 bit system. I tried to return it within two weeks maybe three because I didn't try to use it right away and got no answer to my emails. There's no phone number to call. A real crappy way to do business. I am now stuck with a product I cannot use. I use to like buying from Amazon. Do what you want to but I got screwed!!!!!!Swann PC DVR 4 Net
2,not recommended,"I can not recommend this product, It is easy to connect and install, but impossible to get voice recording, support OK for I think Australia"
1,Does not work with Windows XP Pro 64 bit,Bought this card for use in a Windows XP Pro 64 bit machine.Everything installs with out any errors.But the device shows up without a driver in the hardware list.
3,Software is impressive.. Glitches with Vista,"I've installed two of these cards in two of the exact same machines. I contacted Swann and asked which of the three support drivers would work best for a Vista 32bit application. In both cases I was referred to the latest 5.4 (I beleive) driver update. Upon trying this, I received misc errors. I then tried the oldest driver, and presto. These things have worked like a charm.I'm still working on figuring out the remote viewing and local viewing portion of the device, but so far it has lived up to what it says.Once I get these port forwarding glitches and the firmware correct, I should be good to go. Also this card allows you to recycle the destination folder for your motion recordings, and keeps your hard drive from filling up with squirrels running through your yard, or leaves blowing in the wind.Overall with a little work, I give it three stars. If their Australian support team was a little more helpful, I probably would have gave it four."
1,"VERY INCOMPATIBLE, TECH SUPPORT LANGUAGE BARRIER.","PURCHASED THIS CARD TO MONITOR OUR STOREFRONT. ERROR MESSAGES ON INSTALL 15 SECONDS INTO IT. WAITED ON HOLD FOR SUPPORT UPWARDS OF 40 MINUTES, THEY WERE NO HELP. THEIR REMEDY WAS TO REFORMAT. CALLED 2 DAYS LATER, TALKED TO A DIFFERENT PERSON, HE WAS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. WE WENT THROUGH 45 MINUTES OF INSTALL THIS, DOWNLOAD THAT, MOVE THIS, REINSTALL THIS, THAT, THIS, NOTHING WORKED. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED."
4,Good Product,"I bought this DVR Card to replace the one I had in my PC which was very unreliable, mainly the old card would locked up my PC after running for about 2 weeks. All I can say was this card was worth every penny, it was stable and the software that came with it was very easy to use.Would highly recommend this product."
4,Vey Good Card,Very Good Card. Has all the features you need for Surveillance Camera.Easy to install and clarity is very good.
1,Fault of the card,"This card works only with certain processors and motherboards, something they don't tell you about until it's too late. Unless you like to gamble, buy another brand."
3,good for what it is,"My mom got me this kit as a Christmas gift. I have wanted to try glass beadmaking for a long time, and this is a good introductory set for those who just want to get their feet wet and don't want to make a large investment. The items included in the set are not very good quality, and the kit does not come with much instructional material. I checked out a few books from the library and took a bead making workshop at a local studio to learn the basics. Since, I have used the kit to make several successful beads. I will definitely be replacing the torch and buying some more glass rods and didymium glasses to protect my eyes. This kit is by no means all-inclusive or great quality. However, for the price, this is a good set for beginners."
1,Poor safety,"This kit includes nothing to protect your eyesight. At the very least, it should come with didymium glasses. Do not buy this if you value your eyesight."
5,Love it :D,"My daughter says ""It is really pretty and I love it."" It does not stain her finger. A good deal!"
5,Bigger Conspiracy Than DaVinci Code,"The wanderer is on a journey and manages to stumble across the greatest conspiracy in the entire history of human culture.Where do you go when everything you know is wrong?Well...there seems to be a reasonable answer.Great read, stimulating, provocative!"
3,Good watch IF lock would have been better...,This watch is good. I bought it for my father. It looks nice with no fancy look.Watch is perfect for its price. The only draw back is - its single lock. It gets open with slight jerk also.. so this is causing big trouble.
5,Awesome Watch,I am very very happy with this product. I ordered it on December 7th and was not to receive my item until December 22nd. I was shocked to see it had arrived after 3 days. Opening the shipping package was exciting only to find that the watch was cased in an authentic Fossil box. The item itself was beautiful. It has a nice waight to it for a man of my husbands size. I am one who purchased my share amount of expensive watches and I must say that he is going to love this as much as the Movado.
5,Love it!,"My husband is a huge fan of Fossil watches, he's been wanting another one so I purchased this for a xmas gift. It arrived today in the mail. It is stunning! It looks beautiful, classy, and I know he's going to love it! It only took a few days to arrive, have no complaints at all!"
2,Disappointed but heard back from company,"I bought deluxe Best Friends grazing muzzles from a local store. After a month the hole at the end of the basket began to tear, and now it looks like a comma, not a period, and grows ever bigger.I did hear back from the company's president who offered to swap out my almost brand new muzzle for a new one, free of charge. As for the ever-widening opening in the basket of the muzzle, which allows the horse to eat more and more grass, it was explained to me by several people that it may just be the way my horse tears away at the grass. I am still disappointed that the muzzle hole didn't stay intact for more than 6 weeks, but perhaps it is one of those things where depending on the horse, muzzles don't last more than a few months."
2,disapointed,The muzzle did not work; however there was no packing slip nor return information so I cannot return the muzzle. I am just out $45
4,decoration,"I was thrilled with these toy animals, but did not use them as intended.They were decorations on a baby shower cake. They matched her jungle baby animals theme perfectly. They were nicely painted with a smooth finish and the paint did not come off on the frosting. They were the exact size I thought they were. Very nice quality."
3,vcr BLUES,"This unit is the closest I could come to matching VR555, an RCA vcr I have been very pleased with. However, even though VR639HF has all the same features, it does not tell you what is going on in the VCR display window. It is also a very noisy machine when it ejects or accepts a tape. I was also disappointed with the remote, which has no mute or volume control. I miss too, the HI & BYE which I had with the other VCR."
4,Really works,Great workout but Tony talks too much and is annoying. Wish you could just jump to stretch and workout without all the pre chit chat.
2,Not a complete waste of time,"This book contains several generally accepted principles in creating learning environments. I was actually shocked by an original thought somewhere near the end. The author is very vague, and contradicts himself several times.He says ""A major advantage of the Internet is that teachers do not have to worry about software and hardware issues as much as in other situations."" This is absurd. It is a major barrier to learning. Teachers often have to cope with just those things before any learning on the subject matter can take place. It was not any easier in 1997 when this book was published -- it was more difficult because the technology was still young and far less stable, and because learners were not nearly as comfortable in the environment!I feel that in his push to get his book to market early in the game, he sacrificed content and ideas for (what was then quite forward-thinking) technology.You can learn something here, but watch your step."
3,Mystery classics V. 2,"Since I enjoy all mysteries, I enjoyed watching these and would recommend to anyone who loves mysteries."
1,Read another book instead,"Don't waste your time with this book, it's too technical. Get ""Dress your House for Success"" by Sarah Zackheim instead."
4,Lockie The Lover,Lockies first day at school was promising day. he found his girl.Being a surfy his Dad a cop and his brother wets the bed he didn't stand a chance this book is for 13-14 year old.It is funny too.
1,Try tracfone instead !!!,"Tracfone gives better deals in minutes.It is perfect for those with light, in town usage. It only uses one unit per minute, two if you're outside of your area code(roaming), and long distance doesn't cost any extra. The airtime doesn't cost a fortune, and you have no credit checks, or monthly bills. Reception is good because they utilize many different providers instead of just one. They also have a referral program, so you can earn 100 extra minutes for free if your friends and family buy one too(they also get 180 minutes). If you want a referral to get started with 100 free minutes, just e-mail me at [...] , I'd be happy to send you the link!"
2,Is There a Dentist in the House,"This is a fantastic and mildly amusing movie. Peggy Cummins, Bob Monkhouse and Kenneth Connor do their best but it just can't quite turn out the laughs intended. Director Don Chaffey did the best with what material he had. Perhaps they should have asked if there was a good screenwriter in the house."
5,"rats, snakes and a puppy.","Widowed, and with two sons old enough to live on their own, Mari Grana set about fulfilling her dream of owning a small homestead in a remote area of New Mexico. This she found in Begoso Canyon. It was an old stone cabin, long deserted, with mud-plastered walls, and full of rat droppings & broken furniture. It lacked running water and electricity. Her only companion would be a Labrador puppy. And her pickup truck.This is a beautifully written book. It goes far beyond documenting the struggles involved in fixing up of a cabin or adjusting to rural life. It waxes poetic on the beauty and isolation of the area. It educates (and at times, stuns) us with it's often tragic history. It introduces us to her neighbors and greater community and the strong bonds they have with the land. This book should appeal to anyone with enough ""hermit"" DNA in them to think of escaping the rat race. And also to anyone interested in slice of NM history.A quiet, overlooked gem of a book."
4,Convenient idea,"I love the way this is packaged to fit in a diaper bag. The only problem I see is that by the time your baby wears it, the outfit is going to be very wrinkled. Seeing that this is designed for emergency changes...I guess a wrinkled baby is better than a naked one. Love the colors."
2,Disappointed with Pampers,"I used the ""Feel & Learn"" pull-ups for my oldest son 3 years ago. I recently ordered them for my 2 year old who is potty training. However, this is our last purchase of the Pampers brand feel & learn's. I have switched to the CVS generic. The Pampers fell apart nearly every time he wore them - once @ Wrigley Field (VERY inconvenient time) during the Cubs game. The seams do not stay together - I ordered the largest size and it is supposed to work for his size. But it didn't. I will be sending a letter to Pampers. I have used Pampers Cruisers with my son the past 2 years and plan to use them with my ""baby on the way"". However, the Feel & Learn's need some design help."
5,Pampers Feel 'n Learn Advanced Trainers for Boys,It fits perfectly to my 2yrs and 10 months boy and a good training pants. I would highly recommend this product.
1,Not great at all,I thought by getting these and saving a few bucks would be a great thing. NOT! These are not made for accidents AT ALL! My son might has well had on his big boy undies because they are more absorbant than these.
2,"Hmm.....it's not a scream, baby, not at all!!","What's the point, they're all the same: some stupid killer is stabbing some big-breasted girl, who can't act and is always running up the stairs, when she should be going out the front door. It's insulting!"
4,It ranks # 2 on my top ten list!!!!!!!!! :),"I liked the movie so much I seen it 10 times. I especially liked "" I Still Know What You Did Last Summer."" You picked a GOOD cast!IT WAS GRREAT!!! :)"
4,I know this is a good movie,"What a teen horror flick! You have a strong female heroine, Hewitt, good supporting characters, and a probable plot. The chase scenes were gut wrenching and fun to watch, while the story progressed along quite well. It would have been nice though to have Jennifer Love Hewitt battle the fisherman on her own. She is a smart young lady and is fully capable of handling the fisherman. Other than that, great movie."
4,One of the greatest horror movies of all time.,Kevin Williamson does it again. This film is a worthy follow up to his Scream. The first have of this film is classic.
3,"Better than ""Scream""","I know, this movie was quite predictable, except the killer, but this movie is a perfect example of how books can't be translated to movies, with few exceptions. The movie is way far off the track of the book, and therefore the movie is no better than the book, actually quite worse. The plot is very simple, which is good. But the acting is not very good. This movie has few high points, many low points. For scares, buy ""Halloween."""
1,Cliched crap on the Scream bandwagon,"I thought the Scream movies sucked, but this was scraping dirt where the bottom of the barrel used to be. It was not scary, it was not entertaining, it wasn't even the least bit interesting. I was bored waiting for the end. You know it's a bad movie when you are watching a movie and you just keep saying to yourself 'Oh please just hurry up and be over.""No inspiration at all. It was a movie for the sake of being a movie to get some more cash that fell off the 'Scream' series, that was almost as bad. If you want a good slasher flick, invest in Friday the 13th series."
3,"not very good, but not that bad","The main reason that I'm giving this flick three stars is because Scream, Halloween and Scary Movie all deserve at least two stars more. Another reason is that so many of the characters are such obnoxious jerks that I couldn't wait for them to die. On the other hand, most of the actors did a good job and some of them were very easy on the eyes. It's nice seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar again (Buffy in Buffy the Vampire Slayer). Ladies and gays will appreciate the shower scene with Ryan Phillippe. The music was good. Some of the scenes will help you understand parts of the hilarious teen slasher spoof Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday The 13th. I'm not ashamed to rent this flick, but I wouldn't buy it."
2,Kevin Williamson's first flop.,"I Know What You Did Last Summer is pretty lame in every way possible. Two stars go to Ryan Phillipe and Sarah Michelle Gellar who make this horror flick not so unbearable. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jennifer Love Hewitt on the other hand, can't act worth a dime. The plot is silly as well, these four drunk teens run over some guy after a 4th of July blowout. Kevin Williamson who wrote this movie is the mastermind behind the Scream franchise and the creator of Dawson's Creek, they even made a sequel to this movie (that one is even worse than this, if you can imagine). Stay away from this hook-hand silliness."
4,If Only.... They were all this original!,"Without a doubt one of my favourite horror movies I have ever seen. The premise is original as well as interesting.The core ensemble consisting of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ryan Phillipe are thrown into a terrifying quest to survive when they begin to recieve letters regarding an incident that happened the year before, involving the core cast.The highlights of the movie would be the originality of the whole thing and the cast of actors whom at the time were upcoming talented actors..And not to mention that Sarah Michelle Gellar has one of if not the most nail biting and amazing chase scenes in the history of horror films.In conclusion a film that is definetly worth viewing just avoid the pathetic sequel attempts!"
4,Good Faily a 4!,If you like these kinds of Movies you Will love this Horror (1997) Movie staring She's All That (Fridde Prinze Jr)Ray and Part of Fives (Jennifer Love Hewwit)Julie and Buffys (Sarah Michelle Geller)Helen.In this movie four graduates who are coming from a party runs over a man and dumps him in the lake thinking hes dead.A year later that fisherman Ben Willes comes to ruin the fours live with 2 dead and 2 alive!This movie is a Fairly 4 for one reason!Is written by Kevin Willamsons wh also wrote Scream (1996)
5,"I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie,",Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jennifer Love Hewitt did a wonderful jo of acting. THeir shrieks and screams petrifide me. This is definetly a movie to see with curves and jolts that will keep you on the edge of your seat. HTis movie has a suprise ending dure to petrify the most brave of viewers. THIS SI A MOVIE TO SEE!
5,Excellent!,I loved this movie so much. These young actors all did a fantastic job in their roles. My favorite scene was when they were in the middle of the road trying to figure out what to do about a man they had just hit. It makes everyone wonder what they would do in a similar situation. I could watch that scene over and over. This is excellent from beginning to end.
2,Textbook style horror movie benefits from good cast.,I was surprised when I saw this blazing terd fly across the screen... how could a director waste such a good cast making this complete by-the-book waste of celluloid? The story is mundane and predictable... the non-existant special effects are poorly executed... and the blatant 'there's a sequel coming' ending just left me begging for the credits... If you're a Jennifer Love Hewitt fanatic you'll love this film... if you're not...avoid it. I'd rather watch Urban Legend (and that's not saying much).
1,SHOWS HOW PEOPLE HAVE NO TASTE IN MOVIES!!!!!!!,The movie started out dark and promising but I swear to God this movie was just predictable as h***. What did you like so much about this movie that you gave it 5 STARS??? I cant understand you all. This movie was TERRIBLE! Total camp from beigining to end. It makes Scream look like Schindlers List. Total waste of time. And this movie spawned a sequel which is 100 times worse...STAY AWAY FROM CRAP LIKE THIS!!!!!!!
2,Sarah Michelle Geller Should Have Been Cast In The Lead,"The movie was the only slasher flick to come out after ""Scream"" besides the sequels to ""Scream"" that was any good.The fisherman is creepy looking. My only problem is that for a horror flick the body count is too low. And to tell the truth the film really has no suspense. The filmakers trick us into beliving that Sarah Michelle Geller would pull a ""Buffy"" and make it through this movie to see a sequel, her final scene is probably the longest chase scene for a character in a horror flick that does not live. Usually when there is a prolonged chase scene in a horror flick it's towards the end of the movie and the person being chased ends up surviving.But the only survivors here are Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jennifer Love Hewitt who live to star in this films horrible sequel ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer."" A film that wasn't scribed by this movie's scribe Kevin Williamson."
2,It could have been better,This movie was ok i only watched it to see if it was going to be like the book and because freddie prinze jr was in it.To be honest i screamed more when i babysat one morning during the summer and the kid wanted to watch teletubbies.Trust me if your not big on getting scared then watch this movie.
1,"As a stand alone its ok, but...","when you compare it to the book, this is a stinker.Don't get me wrong, if you want a decently good teen horror flick, this will definitely fit that, but if it is supposed to be based off the book, it falls flat. The book is a really good book, and much tamer than the movie. Read the book, forget the movie."
2,How many more?,"What is it with teenagers? They have their dreams stalked in NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST, they are brutally killed in FRIDAY THE 13TH and now a group of teens run over a psychotic killer. Whats wrong with old people, running over a killer? Just because it's glamouress to have fresh teens fall under the knife, does'nt always mean a realistic film, or good story.This film was okay but far too clich'e. Stalked by a recluse killer, hmmm we've never seen this before. I reckon the sequel to this was an improvement."
1,real horror fans --don't waste your money !!,"Serious fans of horror will be disappointed with this mild and weak film . It's only positive points are the cast , who look lovely ( especially Jennifer Love Hewitt ) , who's acting is okay . Other than that,a complete waste of time !"
1,best acting duo since lemmon and mathau,"There is actually a very entertaining performance given by Jennifer Love Hewitt's cleavage in this film, which steals the show totally away from Sarah Michelle Gellar's thighs, Ryan Phillippe's sensitivity, and Freddie Prinze Jr.'s hunkiness. The at times comically over-the-top pair of actors do a massive work-out throughout the film, being that they have to keep the audience from ever realizing how dull and unoriginal the movie is. The cleavage twosome do their job very well at times, although I think they've done better in lighter films like Heartbreakers. Still, their performance is proof that if you can distract the audience, they will walk away believing they actually saw a great movie."
1,I Know... this movie STINKS,"Oh man. You know the filmmakers weren't thinking when they made this movie. Teenagers hit and run a fisherman and one year later, he arrives in style sporting a fish-hook. Rotten fish! He goes after the teens and manages to reel two of them. Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) needed to put on some makeup and get major sleep, Barry (Ryan Phillippe) made funny comments to the two girls saying, ""you look like stuff ran over twice,"" and the other two (now married in real life) just look as if they're confused why they're even in this movie. ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" is pure skunk. Smelly."
2,A middling slasher at best.,"Four teens who run over a man and cover the crime up are stalked by a mysterious figure who claims to know what they did that night. This Kevin Williamson slasher is actually good fun for a while, before it gets increasingly ludicrous and falls apart completely in the conclusion. Sarah Michelle Gellar is actually decent here, but Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze, Jr. deliver one-note performances, and they do it poorly.** 1/2 out of *****"
2,Preppy horror movie.,"Ok this starting off this is a scream wannabe.Except there is one problem, scream did everything this movie TRIED to do better.I mean come on, juts cause an actress looks ok doesnt make her a good actor that fits the part!!I mean seriously most of the kids in this movie getting killed are rather on the dumb side and you do not feel sorry for them in the least.It starts off with a bunch of underage kids getting drunk, and then a killer hunts them down one by one, yadda,yadda,yadda.This is NOT an original movie.You know every single thing that is going to happen, so nothing at all surprises you.Oh, did i forget to mention the dialogue is pitifull?"
1,what a horrible movie,"this was a terrible movie, it is one of the most predictable movies I have ever seen"
2,Not that great,"I thought this movie was going to be a blast, but it was nothing but cheesy horror.These 4 teeenagers accidently hit a phyco killer on the road coming back from this homecoming queen thing.They dump the body in the water and try to cover it up and a year later they get notes saying soon,and i know what you did last summer.So he tracks them down 1 by 1.The movie is very predictable and the killer always walks after the people and manages to catch up with them and ofcourse nobody is in the streets at the time for god knows what reason! I would recomend something such as Scream which is a great horror movie."
2,The writter of scream couldn't clone his own creation,"Four kids run down a pyschotic fisherman late one night and dump his body in the ocean to cover it up. A year later they each recieve death threats by someone claiming they know their secret. Then, one by one, they get hunted down and killed by a pyscho dressed in a floppy hat and trench coat who carries a hook. The story line to this movie showed very little effort to be a SCREAM clone, even though it was scripted by Kevin Williamson. Not nearly as scary as it should be."
3,Average movie with brilliant DVD-features,"The movie is ok (part 1 was better), it's an average slasher-movie. But the DVD-version really rules! I liked the making of and especially the clip from Jennifer Love Hewitt's ""How Do I Deal"". If you are a fan of Jennifer, buy this DVD! If you're looking for a good horror-movie, try Scream."
3,A fine slasher with a nice Jennifer Love Hewitt,"If you are a horror/slasher film, then you will enjoy this movie. Especially the last 30 minutes are really great. ""I know"" is not that good than Scream, but it is a nice and entertaining movie...and Jennifer Love Hewitt looks simply great."
1,I Don't Want To Know What YOU Did Last Summer,"The only reason I rented this movie was the fact that the writer from Scream wrote this movie too. I thought it was going to be good because of what the critics said. So I watched it. What a disappointment! This movie had no humor at all. It wasn't scary, gory, or even good. I won't even see the sequel! Rent Scream or Urban Legend instead if you want to see a GOOD movie."
5,Stop comparing this to Scream,"This movie was a thrill to watch! The casting was great, the great Sarah and Jennifer in the same film! I personally thought this was a great movie! The only thing I have a problem with is people comparing the movie to Scream. I know what you did last summer is nothing like scream so why mention it at all. Both are great movies. Anyway this movie was my favorite, if only the kept the series going after the sequels . Their was a rumor about number 4 but nothing ever came of it. If you haven't watched this film make sure you do. It's great."
5,A great film to watch on Halloween night.,"I Know What You Did Last Summer is definatly a classic horror flick.The movie is about four friends who run over a man and dump his body in the river so they won't get arrested.One year later they fnd out they didn't really kill this man and he is still alive and wanting to kill the people who ran him over.The movie really is actually very suspencful,unlike some post-Scream slasher films.The movie has good performances from Jennifer Love,Sarah Michelle,Ryan Phillippe,and Freddie Prinze Jr.Kevin Williamson is a genious in the horror film genre.A must see for everyone who loves horror flicks."
4,JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT..,"IS EXCELLENT IN THIS MOVIE, SHE KINDA REMINDS ME OF JAIME LEE CURTIS WHEN SHE WAS IN HALLOWEEN. HER CHARACTER IS SMART, PRETTY AND BRAVE. THIS STARTS OUT WITH A GROUP OF TEENAGERS OUT JOY RIDING AND THEY HIT BEN'S DAUGHTER SARA, BUT INSTEAD OF TELLING ANYONE WHAT THEY DID THEY DUMP THE BODY, THAT'S A BIG MISTAKE. THEIR'S A FISHERMAN WITH A HOOK IN HIS HAND, BEN, AND HE TAKES HIS REVENGE KILLING THEM ONE BY ONE. IT'S REALLY NOT A BAD MOVIE FOR A TEEN SLASHER. IT KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT UNTIL THE VERY END."
2,I don't really care what you did last summer,"I am not into these genre of teen horror flicks that use stupid dialogue and overdone plot sequences.These movies aren't scary at all. Save your money and don't watch this movie. If you want to see a scary movie, go rent one of the Exorcist movies. Sorry, I wish this review could be more helpful, but I just couldn't resist bashing this movie."
2,Are slasher films going through a slow period?,"This, just like all other recent slasher films, have hit a sour chord. Many people say that slashers just aren't up to par anymore, and I agree. I believe that it's mainly because Hollywood decided to start casting celebrity heartthrob 'beautiful people' as the stars.Horror slashers used to cast no name actors/actresses and it gave you a gave you a sense of reality -- that it could be any Joe or Jane Doe being stalked by the killer.You never heard of these people before, and for the most part, never heard from them again.It takes the believability potential out of a slasher film when you see celebrities getting stalked.As for ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" I had high hopes for it and really tried to enjoy it, but it really wasn't that thrilling for me. The more times I saw this film, the more I realized that it was created as nothing more than a fame vehicle for the celebrities that stared in it."
1,Originality takes Hollywood by storm!!!,"Right, and if you believe that about this movie, I got some beach front property in Arizona to sell you. It's no wonder so many people think horror films are cheesey and infantile. With movies like this, how could they not? This makes Friday the 13th seem like ""Gone With the Wind"". Still, I give it 1 star, mostly for the fact that it ended. Want REAL horror? Try ""The Shining"" or ""Psycho"". Something with more brains than a beer commercial."
1,I know why I bored myself to death last summer,"The plot is so full of holes that the whole story trips over into them and never comes up again. The actors do their best to convince us that this is supposed to be scary, but it fails. Better avoid it like a bad rash."
1,This movie is one big piece of siberian snake sh*t,"This could be and should be in the top ten crap list for the 90's horror. They dont make horror like they use to (ie halloween, dawn of the dead, texas chainsaw massacre, just to name a few. Skip this one it is truthfully crap"
1,Better than staring at a wall...,"One mindblowing, boring saturday night I decided to watch I Know What You Did Last Summer. Oh what a choice. So I sat there and watched and watched. The first maybe 25 minutes seemed quite entertaining. But as the plot began to unravel, it seemed more clear to me that it was just like any other Scary teen movie. Yes, some parts of it were suspensful. But the movie was very pointless. Some guy chasing after some rich ass teens after they killed a guy that wasn't even related to him? And what was up with the whole costume? It was very stupid and predictable. Bassicaly this movie is good if you have nothing else to do, than waste one hour and a half of your life."
3,Good......not great,"Although many people think this movie totally sux I didn't. Sure it was predictable and the chase scenes weren't all that thrilling, it still gave me my horror fix for like a month. So I say watch it if theres nothing better, or you've seen everything else"
5,very good,i really want to buy the movie i know what you did last summer also i still know what you did last summer.
2,Read the book,The book by Christopher Pike is WAAAAAY better. I was really disappointed in this movie since I've always thought that Pike's books would make great movies.... hopefully some of his others will do better.
5,IT'S DA BOMB!!,I Know What You Did Last Summer is one of the best movies. Ryan Phillipe and Freddy Prinze Jr were so HOT and Sarah Michelle Geller was brillent. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and the ending is wonderful. GO SEE IT NOW!!!!
5,quit comparing this movie to scream!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I know what you did last summer was inventive and creative...so was scream. How ever they are two totally diffrent films and i wish that ppl would quit comparing them. I know what you did last summer is a good film on its own and doesn't need scream overshadowing it..so go see it..it is a good film..full of tension and laughs.
2,Garbage!,"Yes, I said it was garbage and thought this movie just can reflected one thing that Anne Heche's performance how professional, that all!"
2,Where's Wes Craven when you need him?,"For those of you who think that this movie is the scariest movie ever, you obviously haven't seen very many horror movies at all. What on Earth led them to the idea that dumping the body would be a better option than reporting the incident to the police? ""This is your future, Julie,"" one actor says. ""Let's dump the body in the sea."" So, let me guess, you're gonna make the situation even worse by making it look like intentional vehicular homocide instead of a much lesser involuntary mansluaghter charge. And, Jennifer, if you're as talented and smart as you are beautiful, then I know that you're capable of much better. The only reason I gave this movie two stars and not one is that I thought Sarah Michelle Gellar did an excellent job.About the sequel: Rio de Janeiro is NOT the capital of Brazil! Hell, they could have answered Cincinnati and still win! The capital of Brazil is Brasilia. You want a REAL horror movie? Watch THE EXORCIST."
5,SE IT!!!,"Better than Scream! Better then I still know what you did last summer! As good as Scream 2! Allmost as good as Halloween:H20! A HORROR-MASTERPIECE! PERFEKT! Se it! Belive me: you dont even have to like scary movies to enjoy this film! Rent it, or better: BY it today! You wont regret it!"
2,A few brief comments,The first point I want to make is this is NOT a good movie. Not even close. The second point I want to make is that if it wasn't for the inviting cleavage of the two lead actresses I probably would have turned it off. The third point I want to make is that the crabs in Jenny Love's trunk were the best actors in the movie. The fourth point I want to make is that I'm hungry.
1,This movie SUCKS,4 stupid teens run over a serial killer and dump his body in the river and hope he'll forget all about it. Then he comes back for revenge. No suspense! No scares! No humor! This is just a SCREAM ripoff complete with nearly matching dialogue. BOO!
1,no artwork,wasnt brand new factory sealed not mention serious tragic opening box frustrated aggravetion disc was tore wear busted cant play it demand refunded useless sending back damage open
2,Gree$dy Writers,"Late in the wee hours of the night after one too many happy hours you are racing home hoping to beat the sandman before passing out and you hit a dead man walking.You see your destiny; jail, legal bills, bankruptcy, and eternity roasting at a bus stop. Using a well placed wetland you do the old man a favor. He wouldn't have lasted out in the sticks anyway.Now some freak keeps calling,""I know what you did last summer.""Ingrate!The script writers started a classic then saw $ signs and behold a cheesy blood bath.One last observation: The creepy crawlies made me think buffet, buffet, buffet."
3,Scary and okay,I thought it was okay. it wasn't so bad. it's like your in the movie and you want to get out of it. but then at the end you say to your self im not the person thats getting killed here its jest a movie so then you want to see it again. I think it is better then I still know what you did last summer. Number 1 is more dead people and scarier. I would rate this 3 *** stars.
5,horror flick,this is a first class horror movie i first saw i still know what you did last summer just cause im a horror buff and was very dissapointed the acting was bad and they didnt even show brandy that much then i watced this and was impressed see this.
1,i don't care what you did last summer,"I will start by taking away the one star i gave this movie. This movie is a disgrace to horror flicks. ""I know what you did last summer"" is a product of an alarming number of ""designer horror movies"" being produced in Hollywood. If your going to make a horror movie, make a horror movie! Go all the way! None of this cop out editing and close-ups on an axe dripping blood. we want to SEE the axe going into Jennifer Love Hewitt's head, we want to SEE the giant hook gouge out Brandy's eyes (in I still know....). The director of this movie was obviously more concerned about worrying if Sarah Michelle Gellar's pants were on tight enough. The only massacre going on in ""I know what you did last summer"" was the actors reading the script. I'll bet i know what they're doing this summer..................................... Making another terrible ""I know what you did last summer"" sequel!!!!!!! Bllllllllllllgh! Gag me with a hook."
1,It is AWFUL!!,"I first saw this movie a good time ago when it first gained a theatrical release. It appalled me then, but after seeing Trojan War, another of Jennifer Love Hewitt's movies in which her acting was superb, I decided to see it again. And, I'm sorry to say, the movie is still terrible. The acting is atrocious, the scenario unbelievable- the 'Fisherman' must be superhuman to remove all those crabs and the dead body in a matter of minutes, and to sneak into a house and hide in a closet all night.It's cheap, nasty and utterly unconvincing. If it wasn't for the excessive gore, there would be no audience for it. And, now, it seems I'm to be punished for ever going to see it with the release of 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'. God help us all.Love, you're a great actress- get out of this pathetic chain of movies while you still can."
3,Quite boring,"This was the first true product off the conveyor belt of Hollywood teen-slasher flicks after the highly over-exposed SCREAM. Teen-slashers were suddenly back in fashion. And Hollywood loves teen-slashers. These movies are basically the same tripe done over and over, made for very little, with no aces up the sleeve and...actors in their 20s playing teenagers. Something that bothers me very much. You've probably noticed this by looking at my other reviews.IKWYDLS is no exception. Every scene has been done before and the film has little originality. Some of the killings are totally pointless and are only there to fill up the running time and give us something to look at while the characters argue over ""who is the killer"". A standard argument in these kind of movies.It's a very boring film. It takes ages to get started and when it finally does get going it's more annoying than it is exciting. Bo-oring."
2,2.5 Stars for medicore teen scare,"I've watched my fair share of teen horror films, this one, was simply boring. I watched from beginning to end tried my best to get into it and my viewing taste wasn't having it. I'm sure the book was better than the movie (they usually are). The acting was so-so at best, the plot was flat due to the poor execution, and the scare factor was limited. Since I did not watch this movie in 1997 and did not go see it for the star power, my appreciation for the movie won't be there like others. While I like Sarah and Ryan, this movie just missed the cut, in my opinion."
5,One of the best =),"What is not to like about this film? One of the greatest and most memorable horror films out there. The kills were very good and suspenseful and the film moved along with many sneaky creepy moments all coming to the grand finale which was a very suspenseful chase scene. I have to say, everyone will mostly remember Sarah Michelle Gellar's chase scene which had to be very long and she did put up quite a good fight unlike most females in horror films. AMAZING FILM OVERALL!"
2,It's Not What I Would Call A Thriller!,"The movie ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" grabs you off of your feet for a couple of minutes in the beginning, and about 10 minutes in the middle. The ending only has one scene that gets you, so this movie wasn't well done. I am only being honest. It is not as suspenseful as the movies Scream, Scream 2, any Alfred Hitchcock movies, or its sequel. I also believe that the language and sexual content in this movie is also inapropriate for the young viewers who enjoy these movies. Many of my friends and I enjoy the Alfred Hitchcock movies, which display no bad language, and nothing but maybe a kiss. I also believe that it is more fun to be involved in movies, like Alfred Hitchcock's movies ""Rear Window"" or ""North by Northwest"" in which you get to try to solve the mysteries along with the characters. If you really want to view a modern scary movie, then I would recomend ""Scream 2"" or ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"". This movie is not a good choice."
5,Can't Wait To See The Sequel!,"This movie rocks and anyone who doesn't think so needs to watch it again, or maybe they are not as big of a horror fan as they thought that they were! All I have to say is if you buy it, it's well-worth the money!"
5,a killer stalking the teenagers who hit him with their car.,"Teenagers who accidentally hit somebody with their car dumps the body in the river. They think everything is alright, but they were so far from the the truth. A killer dressed as a town legend and tries to kill them one by one."
3,An average movie that profited from cute young people,This is an average movie and by that I mean that it isnt totally bad and it does have some great moments but the story doesnt hook you the way scream did. A good performance by Jennifer Love Hewitt and a good supporting role for Sarah Mochelle Gellar help but the story jus has too many glitches.
3,Typical Hack-Um-Up,I wasn't too thrilled with the movie. It was typical of all the other hack-um-up movies of the past. The ending was a big let down. Another ending that's obviously meant to leave room for a sequel.
5,Outstanding!,"Sound was awesome with dolby digital receiver, I've seen this movie 3 times, and it still makes me jump in certain scenes just from the audio track!Can't wait for the sequel to be released on DVD!"
3,too familiar.....,after watching this movie i noticed it resembled the book called `the hitchiker` from the point horror series. if you have read this book you will know what i mean. it was a bit too predictable.but all the acting was great.
3,Not great but not bad,"I think that,I Know What You Did Last Summer,is an ok movie.But I think they should have made it more like the book.Books are always better that the movies."
5,It was a great movie I would recomend it to adults.,It was a scary movie. I think it had a good plot too. It was one of my favorite movies.
3,"The Gorton's Fisherman. OOOOH, SCARY!","First off, I would like say that I Know What You Did Last Summer is not a good movie. However, it is an ENTERTAINING movie. Just as long as you never take it seriously, it could make for a wild Friday night rental. The plot isn't anyhthing too original (teens do wrong, teens are stalked and killed in vengence for the wrong, teens try to find killer) and the acting is mediocre, but there are some decent murder scenes, like the ""department store killing"". One fault I have to key on however is The Gorton's Fisherman. His costume just isn't scary or symbolic, so Columbia can forget about issuing the rights for Halloween costumes. I did it have been made in the 80's? That way we could have seen at least some of Miss Hewit or Gellar. (Yes fellas, that's right! There is absolutely NO nudity in this film!) Bottom line, it's a worthy rental. But don't expect much"
2,Pretty bad,"Compared to it`s cousin ""Scream"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" (long enough title?) is pretty god-awful. First off, it was totally blatant that the film tried to live up to Scream`s quality, but it fails miserably. 2 out of the 4 lead actors can`t act (It`s pretty obvious who), and the plot is pretty vapid and stupid. In fact, the plot is an example of what ""Scream"" jeered at. ""IKWYDLS"" has the basic running through the woods, killer with hook, unexpected jumps, ""open the door!"" substance that gets tiring, FAST. The only positive thing about the movie is it kept the gore to a minimum."
5,Fabulous entertainment.,"I had wanted to see I Know What You Did Last Summer long before I did, and i'm so glad I saw it. It is fabulous entertainment full of thrills and chills and plot twsits to keep you on the edge of your seat and begging for more.The sexy cast are Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Ryan Phillipe who play Helen, Julie, Ray and Barry. On the magic night of high school's end they all decide to get together and go to the beach. On the way back, they accidentally kill a man. They bury his body, but a year later, Julie gets a letter saying ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" - eek!"
4,An edge of your seat ride all the way through,"I usually dont watch teen movies cos the actors are very lame and naive at times. I watched Scream because of all the hype and liked it. Then came this stating scarier than Scream I thought its worth a look. Its about a bunch of teens who start partying, go crazy get drunk and run over an innocent road crosser. With the fear of going to jail for murder they decide to dump the body so nobody knows, but the problem is somebody knows. This somebody is gonna make these teens pay for what they did.The film is more thrilling than scary, if you are looking for exocist type of horror then this is not it. The DVD is two sided with the widescreen and full screen versions of the film (the film is all on one side). Theres also a directors commentary if you can be bothered."
1,Why must they sink so low?,"Ah, here we are, scraping the bottom of the barrel once again for what may very well be the worst horror movie ever made. Plot matters. So does acting. People forget these things and make movies like this to plague the general populace. Do you know what was scary about this movie? The fact that it made any money at all. Gives me the chills every time I think about it."
1,"I'll get you for this, and you're little dog too","Hewitt and her dumb friends hit a serial killer on a deserted road and dump his body in the nearest body of water, vowing not to speak of it again. Until he gets up out of the water and hunts them down one by one. Dreadful SCREAM clone is nothing more than an excuse to bring back the ""He just won't die"" slasher films of the'80's with no humor despite it's video box and nice cast. The sequel is better."
5,It was an excellent movie.,"This movie was an excellent movie because Jennifer Love Hewitt shows her talent on the screen. This movie was very suspenseful from beginning to end,and Gellar was very good as the beauty queen."
5,This movie rocks!,This movie movie is da best. After reading the book I just had to see the movie. I would definitely recommened watching this movie.
2,"a good horror flick, but lacked major details","I have read most of Mrs. Duncans books and this isn't at all the best one. It has a good scare element in there but it lacks a real plot. In the movie they don't really develop it very much. Hewitt did an outstanding job as an actress. which brought the movie up to bar, good acting. It's a great one time see movie. I gave it two stars due to lack of plot, and jumpyness in the whole movie (skipping around)."
2,Scariest thing about this movie? That it actually sold!,"Again, this was another movie I was really psyched to see because the previews made it look great (of course). It didn't take long for me to see that this movie was just going to be lame and annoying. The characters in it are no more than over-aged cry-babies. The story-line and plot were just so stupid that I found it had to believe anyone could enjoy this. While we're on the subject I might as well mention that ""I Still Know..."" was even worse. Really want to see this movie anyway? As for it as a gift so you don't lose out on any money when you want to throw it away."
1,WHAT A PILE OF SHIIIEET,"GOOD GOD WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU 4 AND 5 STAR PEOPLE""I can't wait for the next horror movie with Ja Rule!"""
1,who cares what you did last summer.,I saw the 1st. know what u did. and it was the worst movie I saw. with the worst actong. the only reason why i MIGHT THINK of seeing the 2nd. one. is because of FREDDIE PRINZE JR. i just saw she's all that tonight. And it was really good. I LOVE FREDDIE PRINZE JR. HE'S SO BOMB AND SEEMS LIKE A SWEET GUY. HE'S A REALLY GOOD ACTOR. I'D LOVE 2 MEET AND STAR IN A MOVIE WITH HIM ANYDAY.
1,where did the horror go?,"They're all the same. Some stupid teen runs around screaming while being chased by some mysterious psycho. Too much of those Scream-like movies. This is NOT a horror movie, it's a 'slasher' movie."
1,Needs a HUGE makeover if considered to be good.,"This movie is something completely different than from what I thought it would be. The comedy is not funny, the suspense could be a little more suspenseful, and the actors should take much, much more acting lessons. Jennifer Love Hewitt is only a busty air-head with good looking friends who don't know a thing about covering up a murder (or so it seems). They just scream and run around instead of taking proper action in the first place. J Love H s*cks in this movie, although I must say Sarah Michelle Gellar is a good actress who should continue with the good work she has been doing. Jennifer on the other hand, needs some help, because she thinks she's a good actress. Please, Jennifer, try a little harder, and people will want to watch your movies and TV show because of your acting, and not because of your body. All intelligent people would appreciate it, except for all the dumb h*rny guys who see your movie for your body. Better luck next time, Jenny."
4,What I Did On My Summer Vacation...,"Four rich kids hit a man w/ their car, dump the body in the ocean, and go about their lives. One year later, they begin receiving ominous threats from someone who knows about their deed. Stalking and murder ensue. Jennifer Love Hewitt (TV's ""Ghost Whisperer"") carries most of the movie as the only one who really seems bothered by what happened. She convinces her cohorts that someone is out for revenge, while trying to solve the case Nancy Drew-style. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Scream 2, The Grudge, TV's ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"") reluctantly assists Hewitt's character in her sleuthing. The killer is fairly impressive and iconic in his black slicker. IKWYDLS isn't as dead-on as the SCREAM films, but it does have it's moments. Watch for Anne Heche (Wag The Dog) in a creepy role, and Johnny Galecki as the world's tiniest fisherman! Enjoy..."
5,Good slasher flick.,"Good movie, cool atmosphere, great killer and lots of suspense. Not the greatest ever but certainly worth a watch or two."
2,My daughter plays guitar too,"I was disappointed in the recording as it was a very simple guitar accompanyment with none of the energy of a WH recording. I could just as well have recorded my daughter strumming her guitar and not paid the $45 purchase price with shipping for the impact the CD had.Also, I paid the extra for expedited shipping and it took till the very last day of the estimated period to arrive, which has never happened to me before. I needed the recording for a new year's party and didn't have any time to practise as it came on the last day.Sorry but don't recommend it."
5,A great how-to book for Cool Edit Pro / Adobe Audition,"I was in need of a resource to explain how to use a trial copy of Adobe Audition, the name Adobe gave to the software when they acquired it from Syntrillium. As of this writing, there don't seem to be any books on this subject under the new product name, so I tried Richard Riley's, hoping it would fill my need. I was not disappointed! His book does an excellent job of explaining how to put this software, by whatever name, to use. The items covered in the book appear to apply to both the prior Cool Edit and newer Audition products, so it should serve owners of the software under either name equally well. It provided a great deal of ""put it to use"" information, and was an excellent value."
3,Disappointed.,"I purchased this book hoping for in depth information on certain editing effects topics, for example ""hard limiting"". From what I read, the book does not go into much more detail than the information already available in the Help included with the program. I have returned this book and will be choosing a more costly one."
2,Very overpriced and quite disappointing,"This book is unfortunately very overpriced (a fact which didn't stop my cover falling off after a couple of weeks though) and difficult to recommend. The best the book has to offer is an accompanying Cd with a relatively current version (2.1) of Qt, which may be a reason to buy for those with a poor or no internet connection (Downloading qt is an ~ 10M undertaking depending on exactly which version, and although most linux distributions come with a version is currently much earlier (1.4, I believe at present).The author seems to have tried to write a reference book in 270 pages. Instead I would suggest such books should try to offer introductions and an pedagogical overview as does Solin (""Qt Programming"" by Sams), since the online Qt documentation is almost impossible to beat as a reference (what it leaves to be desired is the short complete examples covering the wide spectrum of classes/concepts that Solin achieves)."
1,Waste of money!,"I have the the ""Qt Programming for Linux and Windows 2000"" by the same author, that was a poorly written book, only 20 percent of the content maybe usefull, I am surprised even such book got published, it raise my doubt about HP Professional Books. The list of Qt classes takes at least 20 percent of that book's content. I would sell mine brand new one for...(just to recover part of my cost)."
1,Awful,"The bulk of this book consists of page after page of tables, reformatted from the Trolltech HTML Qt documentation. In what little original prose exists, you will see the phrase ""See the Trolltech documentation"" repeated again and again. A short section on project management is fairly good, but its two dozen pages hardly justify the cost of the book. The few sample programs are undocumented, and don't appear to do anything useful; it's hard to say, though, since many of them won't compile as written.Save your money and simply download the Qt package from Trolltech for free. This slap-dash effort is an attempt to cash in quickly on Qt's increasing popularity, and offers nothing worthwhile."
2,Qt Programming for LINUX and Windows 2000,"Whoever it was that tried to tell me this book was a huge disappointment was absolutely correct. I've already been programming with Qt quite extensively, and this was no more than a repeat reference of the online docs by Trolltech, but worse. At least I can use ""Find"" on my browser to do searches. I feel ...no more knowledgeable than I am already. Please save yourselves the (PRICE) and find a useful book on the subject."
2,Riddled with errors,"While the overall content and organization of this book is good, the text is riddled with errors, inconsistencies, and bad grammar.The publisher could have done a much better job of ensuring that the text followed the basic rules of the English Language."
2,Bells and whistles aren't enough,"I had been looking for a sturdily built pedometer that had some kind of alarm to let me know when I got to 10,000 steps. This one seemed to fit the bill. Most reviews seemed positive, although I read once or twice about steps not counting correctly; it would continue to count down when you were sitting, etc. I mentally disregarded these comments as I was wowed by all the bells and whistles. I bought it and regretted it the first day.Setup could be easier but I had the same problem with inaccurate count. It doesn't matter what extra ""goodies"" a pedometer has if it can't count basic steps! Luckily, I was able to get a refund but a warning. Save your time, money and frustration and don't even buy it. It was worth more trouble for me than it should have been. Planning to go back to the New Lifestyles brand which has never given me a problem."
5,super pedometer!,"It is great to be able to download the info to your computer. This way you can keep track easier of your average number of steps in a month. I think it is so much fun it makes me want to reach an average if 10,000 steps a day."
2,Too many steps,I have had this for about a week and I found it's to sensitive. I can not use it in the car when I am driving b/c he keeps on counting while I am moving and I drive a Lexus so it's a smooth ride. When I picked it up of my dresser and put it right on my belt it had counted already 8 steps from two little moves. I found it was 3 steps more per each step at most times. So even when I did not walk it shows a very high number which makes it worthless to me. I don't need it to show me I am doing a good job when I am not. Now maybe thier is a fix to this and I plan to call the manufact on this today otherwise it's going back. I spent close to 30.00 for mine and I guess paying more is not the answer.
4,Bizarre,"This movie has it all...bulimia, lesbians, a psychotic latina, transvestite nun, and great dialogue.Who could ask for anything more? Check out the original Freeway, also. It's not as bizarre, but very entertaining..."
3,where did all the exploitation movies go?,"Eploitation is alive and well and it's living in the direct to video market. This modern retelling of Hansel and Gretel (no kidding! ) is unabashedly raunchy with little or no redeeming qualities. That's why it's so good! Murder, masturbation, huffing, lesbianism, incest, prostitution, vomiting, and a myriad of other bad things are exploited to their fullest extent. This movie ain't for moralists, so be careful. I'm giving it a three because it's got a good beat and I can dance to it. Enjoy this film."
3,Campy fun!,"Although it doesn't live up to the original, superior film, Confessions is a really good movie. It does start out a little boring and the characters seem less interesting, but stick around and you'll be pleasantly surprised. It has the same amount of over the top violence and bizarre humour and lesbianism. Natasha Lyonne(an excellant actress) perfectly plays the bulimic ""White Girl"" to perfection, and Vincent Gallo has a great cameo as Sister Gomez, the maniac who takes in Lyonne and her on-the-run Hansel, Cyclona, a lesbian who killed all her family for screwing her up. Anyway, the film serves as a twisted version of Hansel and Gretel as the original film spoofed Little Red Riding Hood. Anyway, Don't buy the DVD, rent the movie and see if you like it, if you do, then buy it. Look for David Allan Grier as Lyonne's less-than-professional lawyer."
2,WHITE GIRL 2: NOT FOR THE TIMID,"The first Freeway was an original and well done black comedy. The only way I can categorize the sequel is as a cult movie. This film was disturbing from the start,only to have a more horrifyingly twisted ending.It's hard to say what I liked about it,but it undeniably held my attention. Just as fair warning though,this movie is not for those with a weak heart or stomach. In fact,DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU HAVE NO SOUL. Otherwise,you'll end up having nightmares for the rest of your life and wake up in the middle of the night sobbing to yourself."
1,Is this really from the same director/writer of Freeway?,"We're a long way from the Oliver Stone produced ""Freeway"" with this melange of a women-in-prison/women-on-the-run flick and hints of Hansel and Gretel. Writer/director Matthew Bright scored big in the first Freeway, a street-life take on Little Red Riding Hood. But without Reese Witherspoon, Keifer Sutherland, Amanda Plummer et. al, this new version never takes off. The characters aren't all that interesting, the humor is missing completely, and the cliches come thick and fast. Just so you know, none of the characters from the original appear in the falsely named Freeway 2, and to tell you the truth, I didn't even see too many ""confessions"" here. The only connection is two exerpts from the original appearing on a television screen. I can't really believe that the guy behind the first one had much to do with this one. A big disappointment."
2,dissapointing,"freeway 2 definitely didn't live up to my high expectations after seeing the brilliant original freeway. It's alot darker, and alot pervier than the first, substituting disturbing visuals for witty dialogue. Natasha Lyonne is all right, although i definitely don't think this was her greatest effort ever. Vincent Gallo was very effective as sister gomez - horrifying. One of the many problems i had with this movie is (and maybe i'm being way too literal)that bot of the girls thought sister gomez was really a she! couldn't they see the five o'clock shadow? i saw this movie last night, and i fell asleep at 5.30 this morning, still thinking about her (or, rather, him.) don't get this film unless you are prepared to sleep with the light on for a loooong time."
2,"I love the Lettermen, but NOT this CD!","I own this CD, and never listen to it. If you love the beautiful harmony of the Lettermen in the 50's, you need ""For Christmas This Year"", not this CD. It is well worth the extra money, or get the MP3 version.For Christmas This Year"
1,"""modern"" lettermen",Not at all nostalgic.Original Christmas was well done and respectful of the music. This one sounds like old guys trying to be cool.
1,Overproduced Digital Instrumentation,"I keep pulling this cd off the shelf every Christmas thinking ""Lettermen harmony, yeah"". I end up getting turned off by each tunes intro. Every song is dominated by midi drums & orchestration that overshadows the simple beauty of what the Lettermen do. ""The First Noel"" given a digitally rendered ""Summer Place"" backing track?!, puh-lease!! If the album could be remixed with at least a couple of a capella tunes, or simple (read analog!) piano or guitar accompanyment, it might be palatable. As is, it's a demo of the programming abilities of the producer, the Lettermen contribution seems an afterthought."
1,Save your money!!...,"I received this item broken when it arrived. I too was misguided by the previous good reviews, but after looking at it, it takes up too much space, poorly engineered and is an overall inferior product."
5,cd/dvd holder,Purchased this item approx. 2yrs. ago---outgrew it lok everywhere possible then found it @ amazon/com--different/easy to use/attractive/long lasting we simply wanted to seperate our cd's&dvd's but wanted a match sure glad we did lso the price cannot be beaten.
2,These people got what they deserved....,"Aside from the death of the innocent children, we are all lucky to have these fanatical pedofiles erased from this planet. How can anyone seriously blame the goverment for the death of the children. The Davidians held the children hostage from day one, used them as shields, and finally murdered them all at the end. Those children could have been released any time during the stand-off from day 1, and especially could have let them go as soon as the government went in. They wanted everyone to die. Get the facts straight!"
5,Still A Great CD!!!,"When this CD came out I was 12 yrs old. Now I'm older and its like being a teenager all over again. I mean all these songs take me back. Some albums lose their spark after a while but this cd sounds so fresh. I believe it's Monicas voice which makes everything work. Still one of the best voices to come in a long time, and better things to come I hope."
4,Monica Naranjo's auspicious debut,"A lovely CD, full of passion and intensity. From the heartbreaking pathos of ""Oyeme"" to the dance groove of ""Supernatural"" and the frenetic flamenco/disco energy of ""Solo se vive una vez,"" this CD is a classic of Spanish pop. Monica is a wonderfully emotive singer, and her songwriting with Cristobal Sansano shows great promise. Brava!"
2,Only 1 song I like,"Only 1 song I like, the rest were boring, but if you like Monica Naranjo, by all means, get yourself the CD."
4,This was freakin' hilarious!!!,"The characters in this book are too much! Collen must be a babe. And the angels remind me of Secret service agents from heaven, were they wearing sunglasses, I forget. I wish more writers could catch me off guard like these guys."
2,Is this a reliable source for Bible Study??,"I have no idea if this book is Biblically sound. It is so old that I can't find anything about the author. I can't tell if it really is informed by Biblical doctrine, or if it originated from something like The Watchtower society. I would have to read the whole thing to find out. I really just want a reliable source for Bible commentary, and don't know whether to trust this source."
3,Average,"This was a good book, worth reading, as it is entertaining. I cannot rank it as a 4 or 5 star since it does not do justice those books that SHOULD be ranked as such. From bad to worst in the set it ranks around the middle. It is worth reading if you are a Hardy Boys fan."
3,Misleading Title,"Frank, Joe, Chet and Biff go on a camping trip to the Rockies when Mr. Hardy asks them to track down a gang of credit card counterfeiters. Along the way they come across an Austrian mountain climber, a crazy man who believes he is related to King Arthur and a number of gangs that try to scare them off of the case. Most of this book is quite good; the story was fairly well written and it was fairly action-packed. I liked that there were three gangs after the Hardys and their friends. I found that it made it interesting trying to figure out who belonged to which gang and how they were all connected. The title is somewhat misleading, though, because the book has nothing to do with vampires and vampire bats play only a small role in the story. While most of the book deserves a four star rating, I gave the book three stars because the last chapter was really bad. It lacked excitement, was more silly than anything and was a big letdown to an otherwise good book."
5,Original Art!,One of the first I ever read. It still rocks. Biff! Chet! And the cover art is the same as when it first came out.
4,Off to solve a spooky mystery...,"This book was actually kind of good, but it still was not what I call ""Mind- blowing and fast paced"". Frank and Joe's pal, stocky, good natured Chet Morton unknowingly finds himself tangled up in a mystery after buying a stolen truck. The boys are sent off in an exciting mystery, complete with the same camper Chet bought!This book had a fair amount of suspense in it, so I still encourage you to buy it.So if you were thinking of buying ""Danger on Vampire Trail"",Go To It! <3"
3,Good Book,The Hardy's journey to the American rockies to break up a phony credit card scam. Poor cover art - but the book was action packed with a lot of interaction with the criminals. Among the higher volumes this has always been one of my prefered books. The majority of the book is spent near Vampire Trail camped at the foot of an apparent mountain or large hill. As boys enjoy camping in the great outdoors - it makes for an appealing read. RATED B-
4,CROOK TROUBLE ON VAMP TRAIL,"It was about the Hardy Boys traveling all over the country looking for thieves. They had a few problems along the way. They nearly got arrested once on their journey. They ran into three guys that tried to hurt them. They was getting hot on the theives trail. The they got caught by the gang, which had captured another gang. Luckily Chet got away. He went to the cliff of the steep mountian trail. He then saw a person they saw along the way. They went down the mountian together and got the cops. They came with the cops. To learn more read the book at your local library.I thought the book was a good book. It gave alot of serious detail. It did not leave you hanging, but it will make you wont to read another book in the series"
1,Not compatible with many systems,"Warning: this card does NOT support Media Center in recent Dell Dimension PCs. Sonic CinePlayer will not function after installing the ATI drivers. The card does not work with Roxio Creator MyDVD. Neither ATI tech support nor Dell support can offer fixes for these incompatibilities. If you are lucky enough to have a compatible system, this card may produce great video. But beware, the driver software may not work in your system."
2,"Slow, Slow, Slow!","Pros: The picture quality is niceCons: There is a two second delay, so channel surfing is NOT an option. The product does not come with viewing software. The remote does not tune cable boxes. Plug-ins for the remote software are user-derived and filled with glitches."
3,ATI TV WOnder Elite,"Nice card. An upgrade from my Wonder VE. Video quality is very nice, but software included is crap."
3,DOESN'T WORK WITH SATILITE TV,"If you have a satellite dish and a Dolby digital surround sound card, the ATI card doesn't work very well. You have to use the composite signal input, not the tuner input. The tuner portion of this card is for ANALOG SIGNAL ONLY. In order to watch your satellite TV thru the composite signal in, you have to download ATI's Multimedia version 9.13.Now you can watch Satellite TV, but ATI's Multimedia version 9.13doesn't recognize a Dolby digital surround sound card. You have to us the RCA right and left stereo inputs from your Satellite Box.Even after all that the ATI card doesn't work that well, the response is very slow."
5,Misguided description an ripped off,I returned it because I got a men's watch instead. The seller charged me 8% for restocking ($100.00) even though I clearly ordered a women's. The description of the 1582.30 clearly specified it's for women. I was ripped off by Amazon and the seller.
5,"4 years, no problems",Had my RCA DSS dish for 4 years and service has been great no problems. Looking foward to AOL / Direct TV internet deal
1,I do Tech Support for DirecTV,"I have one word for you...Sony! RCA receivers are littered with software glitches that cause an infinite number of problems. If you do want to by DirecTV, do NOT even CONSIDER RCA or Hughes. Buy Sony!"
1,Hope it does not rain !!,Every time it rains I lose my picture .. RAIN FADE.. I'm going back to CABLE .. I've not been a happy customer since I bought it .. DIRECTV has not answered their phone in two weeks .. message says call back at another time they are to busy .. WHAT DO YOU THINK ??
1,No Spirit,"I bought this as a gift, but was able to listen to it afterward. If you're not a Burning Spear fan (like me), I wouldn't start. The songs all sound alike, and there was no real musical spirit. As for reggae, I recommend Toots and the Maytals over Burning Spear any day."
5,A useful classic,"Have you got two kids who fight?""Remember the cat and the dog that didn't get along, then they did and they were happy?""Read the book and use this line when sibling rivalry causes fights in your house.Love the drawings. Easy to read the whole book at bedtime. A classic."
3,"Cute, funny","Cute, funny, interesting characters--a good read despite the very similar plot to a Susan Elizabeth Phillips book. I'll check out another to find out if she has some original plots..."
5,Mokey is coming,"Sabba toys has announced that Mokey will available summer 2006. I for one couldnt be more elated. She was always my favorite as a child, and you can sure bet I will be watching intently for her."
4,Great but what's with the hair,"I recently purchased the full set of fraggle rock season 1-3 dvd's. My kids *adore* the show. I got them these to hang out with while they watch. Nicely made, but gobo's hair is way more pink than on the show. And it's much longer.He still loves it."
2,I HAVE TO AGREE...,"I am rather disappointed that there is no Mokey doll! Mokey was the artist, Man! Just because they use the expression ""starving artist"" doesn't mean that it's an irrelevent role! Mokey was a ""key"" character of the 5 lead characters. She's the one I remembered first when I remembered the show from my childhood! I don't own any of the plush fraggles either, but my favorite fraggles are the following: Mokey, Boober & Wembley (and in that exact order). PLEASE RELEASE MOKEY & PUT BOOBER BACK ON THE MARKET.Sincerely,A Huge Fraggle Fan"
4,Kavik,"I read this book when I was about 12 or 13, it was soo good that I actually read it 3 times. I highly recomend this book to anyone who likes adventure."
4,This was an OK book.,"This was a good book but it was way to short. Just as I was getting into it it stoped. It is exciting and fun! I think you should read this book. I won't wast your time by telling you what happened in the story because everybody else dose that. Walt Morey is a great author and if you haven't read Gentel Ben you should read it. Walt Morey is my 2nd favorite author, my first is Gary Paulsen you sould read some of his books. This was a pretty good book and I would read it if I were you! :)"
5,one of the best.,"I think this book is one of the best,because it tells of love,determination,and overcoming your fears."
4,"""I won't complain"" was cut off.","I ordered the CD just for the song, ""I won't complain."" Well, I must complain. The song was cut off. I was very disappointed about that. I thought there was something wrong with my stereo, but it had nothing to do with that. The song is much shorter than the original version. If I had known that, I would've continued my search. Other than that, the other songs, which I had never heard before, are really uplifting."
5,Can't complain,"I have found this cd, I Won't Complain, to be everything I expected. I love the song ""I Won't Complain"". When I first heard it, it spoke to my heart. I had to find it. Thanks Amazon! My family and I have played this cd a lot.I truly recommend it."
5,AWESOME CD!!!!!!,This is a soulful CD I really enjoyed listening to it. The songs on the CD are all really good they take you back and you feel the power of God in the words. This is a must get CD REV Jones truly left his Mark RIP!!!
1,Neither Sufi nor Christian - marginally poetry,"In Praise of Rumi is a valiant attempt at modern poetry infused with the spirit of Rumi - especially Rumi's use of ""tavern"", ""intoxication"" and ""separation from the Beloved"". However, some of the poems seem contrived; some seem muddled in a ""sufified"" Christianity; some seem didactic. Unfortunately not one of the three descriptions mentioned above is particularly appealing to me. On the other hand, I do believe that Christian poetry needs a poetry of ecstasy - a Rumi, a Mirabai, a Lalla - and hence I appreciate the intent of this volume."
4,"If you have dreams,this is the book you should read","There isn't on earth more inspiring person than Walt Disney,he was not only a man with big dreams but he also was a visionare,he was a big child who made all his efforts for made his dream come true.His work of art is still a big entreteiment for people all over the world.In this book you can read his biographie and see how a young poor man can built such an empired."
4,Sexy woman - Nice voice,"Well first of all she is extremely sexy. Her voice sounds pure and young, a lot like Shanice. I would love to see her work with some more r&b flavored producers because she definitely have a great voice. The cd has a pop feel to it. I was hoping for more R&B flava. I liked the songs Supernatural & Things that we all do for love (slow jam). She could go far with the right songs. Love you Nona. Looking forward to the next one."
3,first love,"I bought this cd for one song only, ""The Things That We All Do For Love"", because it was very sentimental for me. It was the only single I had ever heard from Nona Gaye, and was released my senior year in high school. The rest of the cd was nothing to rave about, but that song is one that will bring back memories of my first love for years to come."
1,Not about the Smiths-,This was an absolute waste of time and money. It mentions the Smiths in about 1 page worth of material. The rest of the book is about the author. Why they bothered killing trees for this is beyond me. If you want a good look at the Smiths and their music get a copy of The Smiths by Johnny Rogan and a copy of Jo Slee's Peepholism.
5,"I only read an excerpt, but...","...Joe, did you get the channel wrong that you finally caught ""How Soon is Now?"" In the excerpt I saw, you wrote V68. Wasn't it V66? That's what I used to watch. Good old David O'Leary's launching pad (I think)."
2,Pretentious little piece of self-referential twaddle,"Let me preface this by saying I love the 33 & 1/3 series. I also love how every author tackles the subject matter in a different format. However, I do expect certain points from each volume, as befits its intended purpose - like, say, an actual discussion of the album, the making of said album, and a review of the cultural influences and impacts it may have birthed.Unfortunately, we get none in this edition. Avoid unless you enjoy treacly kiddie b.s. love stories that read like a worse Stephen King ""Stand By Me"". Ridiculous waste of time all around."
2,But we looked here,"A couple of the other reviewers suggest we look elsewhere for bits about the making of the album, what Andy Rourke was drinking, etc. But that's why we looked here. That's what 33.3 is about.Joe Pernice is a good writer, and the story isn't half bad (though how many teen angst stories do we really need?). It's just not about MIM. And that's what it is supposed to be about.The worst part is, the album deserves a nonfiction account dedicated to it, and now there won't be one."
5,"FOR THE PRICE , YOU CANNOT BEAT THEM","The price was reasonable, the shipping was prime, so I took the chance on these bits. I predrilled holes in 1/8th inch thick angle iron a self-tapping screw stalled on. I had little trouble and would recommend these bits to every homeowner."
1,Didn't last 5 minutes,"I received them today, a day late from expected delivery. I used one and it broke,I used another and it also broke. Very brittle product, do not recommend."
2,1/8 bit broke in half after first use,"These bits aren't 'super hard' as the name suggests. My 1/8"" drill bit broke after the first use..I have used the other, larger drill bits in drywall and they have been fine so far. It's a good cheap set that can get little jobs done (like putting up wall shelves). Def not heavy duty."
4,Good quality cobalt bits,"I was very hesitant to buy these as the price appeared to be too good to be true for cobalt steel bits. I have only used them once, but it was to drill through high-tensile carbon steel that regular bits wouldn't even dent. Sure enough- drilled right through (using generous lubrication to keep things cool). At this price I will likely buy another set just because it's such a screaming deal."
2,weak,i got these along with another set and just like the other they could not hold up to the work load went dull fast even with lube
1,Sets the bar high for fake products,"First, Neiko Tools USA sounds like the US sales division for a Japanese tool manufacturer, but this isn't one of those. It's just another Chinese tactic to give junk the appearance of being good stuff at an outstanding price.Second, these aren't cobalt drills; they're ""cobalt coated."" In my experience, ""cobalt colored"" would be more accurate. I've completely rounded the tips while trying to drill through thin mild steel; I've also smoked a tip on mahogany boards. If you're drilling anything harder than, say, dry pine boards, go buy something that's made of actual cobalt."
4,Neiko Cobalt Drill bits,"I've only used these bits a few times but cobalt is the way to go. I am going to throw out all of my old worn and dull bits. I tried sharpening them using a specific drill sharpening machine, but no luck."
4,The long awaited and long needed return of Bonfire.,"One of the better later books of the series, ""The Black Stallion's Sulky Colt"" continues the story of the harness champion and second son of the Black, Bonfire. Alec must help Bonfire's owner and driver, Tom Messenger and Jimmy Creech, after the horse starts spooking at horses on his right side after a bad accident. The ending is perdictable but the trip between is refreshing and interesting as Farley peppers his writing with information about harness racing. Worth the time and money."
5,A wonderful book that you will never forget,"Author Campbell Armstrong has written a superb book about his much loved former wife Eileen and her daughter Barbara who were apart for over forty years.Both women were afflicted by cancer and the story of their meeting,together with the author`s self analysis of his own life make this an unforgettable reading experience.Families who have encountered this dreadful disease will be inspired and encouraged by this moving memoir."
1,Not very good,"I checked this book out of my local library, and boy was I glad I hadn't bought it because after the fourth chapter i wanted to stop reading. It really is a boring book compared to other buffy books, such as child of the hunt, or note from underground.I would recemend not buying this book."
3,not only typos,"If you are already an experienced DBA, this book may be helpful as a quick reference. If you are still trying to be a good DBA or preparing for an OCP test, this book is not a good choice. It is misleading. I read some pages in the very beginning and feel disappointed that the SMON is Server Monitor (system monitor in Oracle Manual), DBWR is Dirty Buffer Writer (Datebase Writer in Oracle Manual). To make things worse, the author has not offered any corrections for his books."
3,Could be much better if it was error-proved,The tests are very disapointing because of the numerous errors and misspelings that are so abundant. I do hope that in a future revision these could be eliminated and the material better presented so to correspond to the real exam covarage. Otherwise the test questions very much resamble these sample ones you could find on the Oracle Education site so it is evident that the author is insider.
4,Well worth the money,"The 2 Exam Cram books by M. Ault do an excellent job of prioritizing what you need to know to be an effective Oracle DBA or technical support person. If you know what's in these 2 books, you'll be a good DBA for any typical Oracle site. I disagree with those reviews that emphasize errors/typos... there a few, but they hardly compromise the value of these useful books."
3,A good supplement,"This book is not enough to pass the tests. However, if it was, then the certification itself would only be worth $29.99 list (the cost of the book). This book, in addition to the other titles referenced and experience should be enough.The second volume is better."
2,Get it for the practice tests,"Badly organized, bordering on criminal. Author recommends that you read chapters 2 through 10 for test 1, and then chapters 2 through 10 (again!) plus chapter 13 for test 2. The author could have separated these sections better (like he did in his follow-up book: Tests 3 & 4).Also there are some horrendous mistakes, particularly with some basic concepts. According to author, DBWR is ""dirty buffer writer"".The practice questions, sample tests and cram sheet are the best aspects of this publication, and almost compensate for the inadequacy of the rest."
1,This book is out of date,"This book is completely out of date. It covers only Oracle7, with little to no applicability to the current market. Is this guy ever going to come out with an Oracle8 book?"
3,Lot of errors which may lead to a poor scoring in the exam .,"Errors are more,but still it will help an Oracle DBA(with atleast 2 years hands on real industrial experience), to certain extent to get through the OCP.Before you read this book please go through the Oracle Documentation(comes with your ORDBMS/RDBMS) carefully.However I don't want to REJECT this book. Michael R. Ault Please correct errors and bring a better second edition. Best of Luck to all the NEW READERS."
2,Where is the beef?,"The long and the short is this, the book is too brief. Combined with the massive number of mistakes not a good book to use for OCP candidates.j.c."
2,Not the book I wanted,I was hoping that this book will provide a good study material but alas I was dissapointed. First this book covers only Test 1 and Test 2 . You need to pass 2 more tests to get certified. The course is not well structured . More attention should have been paid to the contents of the book.The author gives an impression that everybody who reads his book will pass the exam which is a false impression. I would recommend the book by Jason Couchman which is expensive but good.
2,The wait was not with worth it!,"I waited several months for this book to be published. I even pre-ordered this book and find myself believing I wasted my money! I have 2 specific issues with this book: 1) The organization of material is not presented in the order of the tests. 2) There are gross errors in the sample test questions. Examples: Pg 362 Question 1, the answer key states 'B' while the explanation states 'A'. Pg 303 Question 42, the procedure references variables 'v_proper_ratio' and 'v_found', while the question references 'v_proper_line' and 'v_approval'. Pg 40 Question 3, 'b' is the correct answer (LGWR), but the choice is typed as 'GWR'. Pg 43 Question 8, states 'Which shutdown mode will require instance at the next startup?'. Obviously, the word 'recovery' is missing. On and on...basically if there are this many gross editing errors, can the rest of the information be accepted as correct?"
3,"OK, but caveat emptor...","Most of the other reviews have outlined the perceived problems with this book. I just passed (barely) the PL/SQL test, and my comments are based on that part of the book only. This book is useful as a review before the test. The organization is not optimal IMHO, forcing one to read extra material for the PL/SQL test. It is not useful as one's primary reference for the test - caveat emptor! The strong points are the tests after each chapter and the sample test in chapter 12. The explanations for each question are useful. However, the comments about typos, et cetera are true. For example, I think question 1 in chapter 8 probably was supposed to go in chapter 9. I also used the Kevin Couchman DBA certification and Scott Ulman PL/SQL books from Oracle, and the free self-test downloadable from Oracle, as well as the Boson test, and about five days of exposure to SQLPlus."
3,too much for test #1,"If you are just be preparing for test 1, the contents of this book may be confusing since it focuses a lot on the DBA stuff which will not appear in test 1.On the other hand, the sample test in the end is extremely similar to the real test. It goes into detail very much."
1,Buyers Beware !!!,"I bought mine from 'Surpluscomputerbooks'. This seller is veryunscrupulous! I thought it was for Oracle8i, but it turned out to be for Oracle7 !!! Beware of what you buy into, someone might be dumping out of date material on you!"
5,Excellent final review and test questions.,"This book provides an excellent final review to read the last couple of days before taking the test. The sample test questions, along with answers and explanations, are excellent as well.For test 1: I recommend studying the Oracle PL\SQL book as the exam covers much more of PL\SQL than expected. Be sure and work ALL of the problems! Then study the official Oracle study guide and then this Exam Cram.For test 2: Study the Kevin Loney Oracle DBA book and then study the official Oracle study guide and then review it with this Exam Cram.Just my two bits worth... take it with a grain of salt..."
1,Almost completely worthless,"The only worthwhile part of the book, like all exam cram books, is the full exam at the end. There were several errors or vaguely worded questions that wouldn't make it past a beta exam. The chapters are pretty much photo copies of the oracle documentation with one main difference -- there are VERY FEW examples. Do not waste your money on this or any other exam cram books."
2,A great disappointment,"I still love this group, but the music wasn't up to pare with their other projects and live performances. Don't waster your money."
4,Not as good as their first,"This is a fun DVD to have as an extra if you already love these guys, but it's not nearly as good as their ""Three Mo' Tenors"" DVD (also available for purchase). This DVD has different songs than the first, and the songs are fun, but they all seem too focused on tonal gymnastics and ""in your face harmonies"" rather than focusing on the story being told in each song. Cook, Dixon & Young also don't seem to connect with the audience quite as phenomenally as they did in their previous show. Also, for reasons beyond explanation, the costumer put them in black clothing with a black stage background through almost the entire show, so you just see little bits of color coming out at their collars and cuffs...not fun to watch. As I said, if you already love these guys, it's a fun second DVD to have, but if you want the best of their work, spring for the other DVD ""Three Mo' Tenors."""
3,Average performance,"I expected great things from this CD, given my prior exposure to the group. However, I found their performance here as obscure and uninspired. Disappointing."
5,"Cook,Dixon&Young, Volume 1","Excelent show. Good to see and hear African American singers, professionally trained, proficient in the many types of music."
4,Becoming accountable,I love this. It makes me accountable for my exercise. It's accurate and I love that it keeps calories and records and logs it all. I have used it in water and on land. It is perfect for all levels of exercisers. It is comfortable and looks nice. Great features.
1,Stopped working after three weeks,"Three weeks after purchasing this unit, it started recording strange heart rate readings for no apparent reason. The next day, it stopped reading the heart rate all together no matter what I tried. It now seems to be stuck in one mode, simply recording time. I can reset it and I can use it as a watch but that's it.After reading all of the other reviews here, I'm not sure it's worth the time to try and get it repaired."
4,Practical monitor but lack some features,"I know it is not a watch however it would be great if by night it could have a light button. I wear it all the time but knowing time in the middle of the night is not that easy. Also some features like a timer, alarm and a stopwatch alone will be good to have. But overall is a great monitor. Night reading is the only con."
2,Polar Heart Monitor,"I used my Polar F4 consistently for 2-3 weeks before I ever had any trouble with it. Now I can't get it to pick up a heart rate, and if it does, it isn't even close to correct. I have tried all of the trouble shooting techniques, and nothing has worked. I will be sending this back to my great disappointment. I will probably buy a different one, but I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone."
4,Good product,I have been using this heart rate monitor for 1 month now and I have no complaints. My heart rate is always accurate (against the machines at the gym and taking my pulse manually) and the information on the wrist unit is easy to read.
4,Good basic HRM/watch,I have owned this product at least a year. I have not yet had to replace the battery. It is a good basic watch. My main problems are that it is always on...you can't turn it off when not using it (the watch feature is always on) and that there is no backlight which makes running before dusk/after dawn difficult.
2,Stops working accurately,"I've owned two of these watches and both of them stopped reading my heart rate accurately within a few months of daily use. While running it will start out giving an accurate reading, then start jumping around, giving me an impossibly high (151 at a slow jog) or low reading (71 while running uphill) or it will jump from an extremely low to an extremely high heart rate (51 to 160) in a second, a virtually impossible reading. It's maddening. For some reason, I do not have this problem while working out indoors at the gym. Only when running outside. It's too bad because it's easy to use. But what's the point of a heart rate monitor that reads everything but your heart rate."
2,Loved it....until it BROKE,"Love this watch, awesome tool for working out & improving fitness. But the ""start"" button on the left fell off after 10 days, rendering it useless. I've sent it in for a warranty claim, so we'll see...."
4,Good Buy,"I am very satisfied with this purchase. The only reason im not giving it five stars is because it doesnt have a stop watch or a pedometer. I have a small wrist, and the watch face is a good size especially if you dont like a bulky look. It is comfortable and the band stays put. It is easy to operate, and set up. you can easily turn the sound on or off. The strap is probably the same as all others and occasionally when i switch from doing cardio to weight training the clasp will pop apart, but that only happens occassionally."
4,Great for workouts not 100% perfect,"I love the heart rate monitor. I love knowing how many calories I burn in my workouts, my trainer is even using it now to gauge how hard he is working me. But I have to say untill you start sweating it has a hard time picking up an accurate heart rate, make sure you do what it says and wet the back of the sensor a bit. I do love that a lot of cardio equipment automatically picks up the polar sensor!!!"
4,"Good for ""new"" fitness junkie",Used this model to replace one stolen at my gym. Was perfect and works with all polar machines in my gym and with the band from other model. The storage isn't as large as previous monitor - but it works great for me!
4,Simple and easy,"This watch is simple to use. The instructions are very easy to follow. It's fun being able to see my heart rate while I'm exercising. It works with the heart rate monitors on the equipment at my gym. I don't have to hold on to their handles. The signal is transmitted from this heart rate monitor to the treadmill, elyptical, or whatever, and shows up on the screne.I wish the watch had a stopwatch and a light. No such luck."
4,A great gift for my lovely wife.,This is a great watch and it's why I got it for my wife for our anniversary last year. She likes to go walking so the heart rate feature was also a nice added feature. It has manual and automatic heart rate zones so you can find your target heart rate and then monitor from there to see your progress. It also has a stopwatch feature so you can time your walks as she does. For the price I think it's worth it as it has so many great features. She has really enjoyed it.
2,"A good product, but you might do better.","I trained for a marathon and several 10K races using a heart rate monitor. They are very good instruments for training and I recommend them to everyone who wants to lose weight or get in shape. After you've purchased one or two of them, you become a better shopper. I purchased an F-4 for a friend, and I was very, very disappointed in the battery life when I found out how soon the battery in the main unit wore out. Some of the newer heart monitors - Nikon for one- have user replaceable batteries so you can save a lot of money and time replacing batteries after one or two years."
4,Polar Ice blue HRM,"Gift for wife who works out at 5:30am. Primarily because it would support her current routine: Lots of Aerobics.Nice that it's compatible with many of the treadmills/ steppers...Easy to set-up and use. Medium chest strap fits her, (size 4) and adust to fit me as well(42'' chest. had to try it). Got this primarily because of design, color. Ofcourse the features are very important, and I trusted that this model had most of the valued features in HRM's.I've owned Polars before, and it helped me maintain a great workout schedule. My wife uses it everyday, and really enjoys the summary feature which recaps the week totals."
5,Love it!!!!,The family loves the entire set! What inspirational music...everyone has a favorite or two. Have recommended it to family and friends.
5,Wonderful,"A fine piece of art, simply wonderful. Very good job Israel Houghton and team, thumbs up for all of you."
1,Avoid this flaccid derivative like THE PLAGUE!,"I had excoriated this novel from my mind, and then was reminded of it strolling along an Amazon Cyberpunk reading list.This is derivative junk. It is not an homage or pastiche - it was an attempt by an author to ""cash in"" on the cyberpunk craze of the 80s. It is forgotten, but not a ""forgotten classic"". The plot is puerile, the tech laughable, and the characters one-dimensional. VERY little suspension of disbelief or sociological relevance. Some reviewers say that the main characters are based on ""real"" punks of the Paris underground. Whatever. Then the author COMPLETELY failed to make them believable or interesting!Avoid this trash. If you get a retro kick to read some classic cyberpunk look out for the usual suspects - Gibson, Sterling, Spinrad, Brunner, etc. Or even second and third wave authors. Avoid this book."
1,Co-Pilot has problems,"I've had my Co-Pilot for several years now. The first one failed within a few weeks of purchase. Minn Kota replaced it under warranty. Year two, Co-Pilot appeared to be sensitive to heat from direct sun. It would stop working completely on hot, sunny days. Sometimes unplugging the motor and plugging it back in would get it started gain after shading the Co-Pilot. This happened about once or twice each outing for a couple of years - annoying. Now, the Co-Pilot has quit entirely. It used to give a short burst of beeps when power was initially applied to the motor, but now it is dead and long out of warranty. The wired foot control works great. I can't recommend the Co-Pilot. Too many problems."
5,I LOVE THIS!!,"We bought this for our 5 and 7yr.olds, they love it, they like rolling the balls more than bouncing, but it's alot of fun, very happy with this one, I even love playing with it."
3,Not as great as everyone else said it was,"It's small, and the kids never really took to it after Christmas. It was under $[...] shipped, so no complaints there. It's not the same as the beloved ski-ball. You have to bounce a ball into the holes instead of roll it. It's small, and the kids tend to cheat after awhile racking up the points. Young kids will enjoy this more than older ones. It's ok, but not sliced bread type stuff."
3,"OK, but needs an update","I just bought and read this book. Being a foreigner temporally moving to LA, I appreciated all the general information on buying or renting a house, plus neighborhood information, since I had no clue where to start looking. Now I can confine the area searches to those that (supposedly) match my income and living expectations. The last edition (4th) is from 2005, talking about how the house and estate market will keep rocketing to the sky (and how you get a subprime loan)... Maybe time for an update?"
3,Good all-round information,"This book gives you a bit of everything, but don't expect to get any detailed information. The information on schools is very limited."
2,This was a waste...,"All this is bascially 2 8 1/2x11 pieces of cardstock printed on both sides. I think I could have just found a free pdf file on-line, printed it out, and gotten the same thing. It actually looks like that's all this is. Not worth the hassle of returning, and pretty disappointing."
1,Total waist of money,"One of the things the few people that have purchased this thing have said they liked was the fact that the pamphlet put chord combinations together to form a nice sounding riff or pattern, or a Chord Progression.Take the first example on page 7; everything goes along swimmingly until you strum the last G(dom7) chord that makes no sense whatsoever, it should be G(Maj).Once I really went over this pamphlet, I realized it was nothing more than a rip off.Buy Mel Bay's Deluxe Encyclopedia of Guitar Chord Progressions and the picture Chord Encyclopedia by Hal Leonard.These are the only two books you will probably ever need for Chord Shapes and Progressions.I have been buying guitar books for ten years and have a large library of guitar instruction material and I could get rid of about 25% of it with these two books alone."
3,"Good content, cheap printing.","I was actually surprised with the cheapness of the printing, for the price paid, but the guitar chord chart has excellent content. Its a rather thin book, but my wife says she really enjoys the content. I would have been more impressed if they had printed it on something a bit better than printer paper quality, like a magazine or even laminated the thing."
5,The book you will use for years.,"This is the book that I go to when people ask me about criminal law procedure. The text is comprehensive from investigation and examination to execution of sentencing. If your CJ curriculum uses this book and you are debating on whether to buy it, buy it. I have an earlier version and although it may be dated, it would be in case law only. Because of the breadth of information compiled in this text, I used this book alone for a ton of my classes."
3,ok,"did not care for the reading material of this book, it seemed one sided- required for Law Enf class school"
2,Not a good book,"This book is actually quite weak. While, the other books recommended by Actuarial Societies are quite strong, this one does not hold up. There are not enough examples or problems in the book. In addition, the book continually reuses the same information in its examples requiring less thought to get through them.My biggest complaint is how the book approaches Put-Call Parity. This book offers the worst explanation for that concept I have ever read, which is sad because it is the basis for pricing calls and puts."
3,So-So,"This seems to be the book chosen by most instructors so there must be some reason for assigning it. I am familiar with the material from reading corporate finance texts. This text, however, is not written well and is actually confusing. So one struggles to understand what the author is actually saying. Hope it gets better."
3,Nice textbook on Financial Math,"It has important facts that I needed to learn for the Actuary Exam FM.Unfortunately, I find textbooks to be tedious, and it does not provide the answers to the questions at the end of the chapters."
4,Smart intellectual history--if you can take it.,"This is a detailed (painfully so) and scholarly (painfully so) account of the development of Modernist aesthetic theory through the twenties. L.'s contention is that the period, which seems jumbled and contradictory, was in fact a period of distinctive trial and experiment"
3,More than just good fight scenes...,I bought this DVD at a local store expecting low level acting & decent fight scenes. Didn't expect the great acting & really good fight scenes. I was most impressed by some of the special effects especially fire shooting out of one of the fighters stomach.
4,great fighting,"I loved this movie it had great fighting scenes, and good actors, the story was a little used, but overall it was good."
4,Workbook only,This is only the workbook to the Every Womans Battle book.This workbook is does offer some strategy and insight on singlehood but is not that great of a tool.
3,Guarding heart,"Every Single Woman's Battle by Shannon Ethridge is a workbook companion that includes quotes from Every Man's Battle and Every Woman's Battle.A women's heart matters. The heart acts as an emotional conductor and radiates how you are feeling to every cell in the the body via the heart's electromagnetic field: this energy field can be detected up to 5-10 feet away (heartmath.org). Your heart projects what it is feeling.Every Single Woman's Battle deals with identifying who the battle is with, the truth, taking thoughts captive, guarding your heart, being aware, surrendering, true intimacy, and retreating with the Lord.Proverbs 27:19 says, ""As in water face reflects face, So the heart of man reflects man.""I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group and was asked to review it on my blog."
4,every single women's battle,"Are you guarding your heart and mind from affairs? This book will help you understand that, while men are more physical, women are more mental and emotional beings. You may not realize that you are destroying your relationships because in your heart and mind you are fantasising about other men.This book is a great self help tool and devotional. You will be asked many questions and if you answer honestly you may be surprised by your answers. This is a great book for personal study if you take the time to really think about the questions and your honest answers. I really learned more about myself from reading this book and i would suggest this book to any woman who is having a difficult time in her faith and her life.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
3,Single Woman's Edition Should be a Workbook,"Shannon Ethridge's ""Every Single Woman's Battle"" broaches a sensitive topic for a unique group of individuals. Her original edition, ""Every Woman's Battle"" would also be applicable, but some readers will be more apt to read this book that speaks to them directly. ""Every Man's Battle"" also had direct quotes incorporated into this version.The format was more similar to an accompaning workbook, but the quotes did not have citations to follow along with the original books. I would have preferred the concepts reworded instead to give a smoother, uninterupted read. Also, the themes are very mature and should be read by young adults. By having accountability in a group discussion, this book offers opportunity to face sensitive and vital topics. It may not be the easiest book to follow, but for readers who appreciate a topical workbook study, this will be a great benefit.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
2,Every Reader's Battle,"There wasn't a moment of hesitation when I chose this book to read. I'm a single woman and I wanted to know what insights were in these pages. I would've been better asking around my neighborhood. This wasn't a new idea, or even a new book (it's more a supplement to Every Woman's Battle) and it was honestly a waste of time. You are much better off buying Every Woman's Battle. Don't waste your time on this one.I was provided this book by Waterbrook Multnomah's book review program Blogging for Books. I was not required to give a positive review, just an honest one."
3,Workbook Review,"This is a workbook and although it recommends you read ""Every Woman's Battle,"" it is still a good study without it. The book is about what the cover says, ""guarding your heart and mind against sexual and emotional compromise."" Each chapter goes into depth about desirous thoughts that may go through your mind, questions that make you reassess those thoughts, and then verses in the Bible may help you in that process.Although it is a good book if you're currently single, I think it is a better book if you are in a relationship. It is easier to get from point A to point B physically than it is emotionally, mentally or spiritually and this book helps you take a step back if you need to. This book may be good for a young women's group, but I think working through it with one close friend or accountability partner may allow you delve more into it.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
3,Every Single Woman's Battle,"As a single Christian woman, so much of this life is put in my path. I'm tempted on a daily basis. I have thoughts that I know I shouldn't, and yet I think them and sometimes let them pass by without a care in the world. I feel things that I shouldn't; desires of the mind and body. It's hard sometimes when you really want something that you see another woman have. And the past few weeks have just been that. I will be turning 30 soon, and I want a family so, so very much. I have desirous, sexual feelings on occasion and I don't know how to control my emotions. But by reading this devotional, it's helped me open my heart and learn to turn to God when I start having feelings that I don't know what to do with. I understand them a little more too. It's not an easy road, but I know that God has a plan for me, somewhere, somehow. And I need to learn to trust it and keep my eyes on Him to keep from straying to the other side."
3,Okay but it's just a workbook,"Every Single Woman's Battle: Guarding Your Heart and Mind Against Sexual and Emotional Compromise was an easy to read book about a challenging topic. Best done with a small group, this book tackled a hard subject and Ethridge did not shy away from asking the hard questions. Readers should approach this book with an open mind and a willingness to evaluate their thoughts and actions when it comes to sexual and emotional compromise. A compilation of quotes from Every Woman's Battle and Every Man's Battle are included throughout and wisdom is graciously shared. Please be aware that this is a workbook.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review, but the opinions expressed in this post are mine."
5,Beautiful rug - Incredible deal!,"Without a doubt, this purchase was one of the best deals I've ever had from Amazon.First: the rug is not only beautiful, but very well constructed. Love the pattern, the colors, and the thick pile. I've had numerous compliments on the rug since it arrived. Other reviewers have commented on how much the rug ""sheds"" after arrival. This simply hasn't been an issue. A few loose fibers...but no more than one would expect.Second: What a deal! Not only was the rug $100 less than any other vendor on the internet. But the purchase price included FREE shipping to Alaska! (For anyone who lives in Alaska, you can appreciate the rarity of an internet vendor actually honoring a ""free shipping"" claim when the shipment is to Alaska.)"
4,Great addition,I used this with red floor mats and it completely changed the car. It made it feel completely different. The only issue i had is that it hurt my hands and took forever to fit it on my 15 inch steering wheel.
4,cool cover,"this cover is pretty neat, just like a racing cover. it held up for about 10 months to a year, but now its starting to crack and peel apart at the seems, but hey i use it everyday and my hands are always on it.. and it will still hold up for another year or 2. so good buy."
2,Nice...for a little while,"I've owned two of these. The first was quite some time ago (years) and I used to love this cover. It lasted a long time. I recently bought another for my new car. I figured a red impala with black leather this would look good. Only a few months later the red is turning dark/dirty and has a number of scrapes and scuffs in the material. At one spot it's down to the liner!These used to be great, now they seem cheap and just fall apart."
3,not to happy,"To bad. Is sure is pretty, but does not hold up. It has small tears and chips in it, and I've only had it a few months."
2,Buy Undead Instead,"If you're time tripping, skip over this one and go right to Undead. This for the most part is just dead."
5,Our favorite toy,"I would say this has to be my 5 month old twin girl's favorite toy right now. I always throw it in the diaper bag for when we go to church because it keeps them occupied longer than any other toy they have. There are so many bright colors on it, the ""tail"" is a crinkly material which my babies love, the also have teethers on it. They seem to love chewing on the feet for some reason. I have washed this ""chicken"" (what we call it too!) numerous times because it has been spit up on and it holds up really well! Definitely would recommend."
2,dissapointment,"i recieved this book this book in the mail and had been eagerly awaiting its arrival. i don't know how else to express it other than i was very dissapointed. i have see Michael Doyle's fist edition of his Color Drawing and my original intent was to buy the second edition of that, but when i saw this book with its raving editorial review i decided to try this one instead. i mean who could turn down a book with a review like ""the most complete guide and study of color rendering of interiors ever compiled"" and ""exhaustive in its coverage"" i thought that this book was going to be wonderful. i think that i might have found it useful if i had never even picked up colored pencils and markers before. There was very little rendering of total interiors just objects or things that might go in an interior. If you are really looking for a complete source then i really wouldn't recomend this book, only a just starting out beginner might find it useful."
4,Great for students!,"I am a senior interior design student and this book was recommended by one of my instructors. It gives good, very basic step-by-step instructions for rendering common building materials with different mediums (watercolor, color pencil, and markers). One issue that I did find was that some of the illustrations don't exactly follow the written instructions, but because of the format, that's a pretty small issue. This is a book that I'd recommend for beginning design students, but more advanced students may find this book a little too basic."
4,EXCELLENT QUALITY SHARP FLAT PANEL LCD TV,"I purchased this TV based on reviews and seeing similar Sharp models in local stores. Overall product quality is excellent. Very stylish look-easy to set up and handle. Can hang on a wall if so desired. Cable hook-ups a little awkward due to back panel arrangement but nice clean look after finished. Audio and Video setup pretty straightforward-actually more choices than most people will need but nice to have the options. The default settings from the factory do need to be changed. Sound quality is tremendous for TV only speakers. Soundfield very spacious in simulated surround with good freq. response,balance and output level. I have DirecTV hookup w/o HD but picture quality excellent on most channels. Remote very intuitive and well-designed. For a price below $900 with free shipping and no tax-a no brainer! You will enjoy it-buy it!"
5,"'More to See' in Sharp's Aquos 26"" LCD TV","We bought the Sharp Aquos LC-26DA5U 26"" LCD TV a few weeks ago. Great picture quality, superb sound, stylish design. After a lot of research and numerous trips to stores, we narrowed our search down to Sony (picture), Samsung (price) and Sharp (middle ground). Sharp definitely gives you the best of both worlds - quality picture at a great price. One area for improvement - remote control design (reminds me of a laundry bat :-)). Thank you Amazon for the FREE standard shipping offer! Got the TV within a week of purchase."
2,Fair,"For some reason of all the pathetic cover arts drawn after The Secret Agent on Flight 101, this one does not bother me. The Monkey is bulleted in the dead center of the cover and captures the eye. The story was action packed and keeps the reader's interest. The brothers are hired by a local man to solve a case for them which takes them to Brazil where they encounter many adventures. Lots of action - but little suspense I found, coupled with a moderate amount of mystery. The book is worth reading but ranks among the set's inferiors. RATED C"
3,It was ok. . .but,"I was expecting more and I feel shortchanged. Listening to this was like listening to a lecture from a high school substitute teacher. While the facts and information presented was cogent, the entire package lacked. It was too short. boring. Uninformative, yet full of information. Um...I wouldn't purchase it again or recommend it to anyone."
4,Old school book of sticking it to the man,"Older book of tricks of the trade. Gives you a basis of how to get started if your a novice such as myself. Definitely a lot better than I was doing by myself. Gave me the starting point I so much needed. I just wish the knives I had stuck a lot better. I'm hitting square on they just don't stick some times which can be costly if floor is concrete like mine(had to grind a few quills already). practice, Practice, PRACTICE!!!"
5,Insight,"This book accurately reflects the emotions and disorientation experienced by the loved ones of a patient who suffers a sudden, unexpected and - at least in their belief - preventable death. I'm not going to debate the medical merits with the first reviewer, no doubt a physician. But after 20 years of representing malpractice victims in legal proceedings, I can say it truly reflects their pain and their motivation in seeking legal counsel in a death case: A desire for information, honesty and validation. The book also addresses how the legal system can be a crud tool for achieving those goals - but the only tool they have."
4,A moving work that invokes every spouse's empathy,"This is a chilling story of the coverups that, while not routine, exist in large medical centers. While the novel has a tragic ending, it reveals a comedy of errors, and the unsettling subsequent covert response. The reader walks away recognizing that a woman as intelligent and as well-connected as Gilbert can still be stonewalled by ""the system"", and leaves the rest of us wondering what our chances are. Even with this, the reader is in complete empathy with Gilbert and her family, and the obstacles that they faced in seeking the truth."
4,My Review,"A very good book for beginners. I expected a much more complex tome. As a carpenter, I found it easy to absorb and am very pleased with my purchase."
3,Its worth it.,"It works perfectly, but sometimes as i begin running the chest band begins to slide or it unlatches itself, very annoying when your running and in the zone. but the heart rate monitor and the signal is always recieved and only takes like a second for it to pick up your heart rate. I would buy it again."
1,UnHappy Customer,Sent me an Extra Small. A wast of money. Never ask me the size. So it will end up in the trash. Cant use it.
1,Utter crap!,"Item is just 4 minutes of grainy images set to bad synth pop. I expected better quality images, more of them, and a description of the artworks at the very least. I realize it's my mistake for not checking the run time, but even the description gives more details than the images on the disc."
3,Good fun time,"I seen this film many years ago and remember few parts, so when i got the chance, i bought it on Amazon.Erik Estrada does a good job at over the top acting in this movie as does most of the cast lol. This movie has it all, a very nude and sexy nun, demonic possession, sex with a demon lol, its a fun ride if u like B movies."
1,Not challenging,"This video is not very challenging. I did all 4 of the abs workouts at once and I really couldn't even tell that I did anything. My abs weren't sore and I wasn't tired at all. And I just had a baby 4 months ago, so it's not like I am in that great of shape. I was very disappointed in this workout video."
3,"Okay workout, but feel decieved","Overall the workout was okay. It has a good aerobic workout, and the ab workouts target the abs in different ways. However, I feel decieved by Shape because the cover to this dvd looks new, but it is an older workout. If you can deal with an older workout then this is a good workout, but if you want something new then you may want to keep looking."
4,Several abs routines,"Good workout, I really like that is has different sections, like Classic, Pilates, Core, Dynamic and I learned several new abs routines. This is far from the usual crunches."
3,A Bit Tricky,I'm not the most coordinated person out there so the dance portion was a bit for me. The ab workouts for a bit short for me as well.
2,Way too easy,"The video certainly has potential, however as someone that has been working out for over 10 years this tape is WAAY too easy. I barely feel a burn while doing the ab workouts, and they are entirely too short. Perhaps if they were three times as long and did all four back to back it would be a worthwhile workout. But I have much better ab tapes that kick my butt with 5 minute segment(notably The Firm abs and Tamilee Webb ab tapes). If you are an advanced exerciser I say pass on this one."
3,FAST PACED!,"The Fat Burn Workoutis not for the average person this is a extremly high paced difficult to follow instructor. I recommend it only if you are ready to step it up in a big way. Absolutly no classic aerobic moves are used and I find the instructors expecting you to know the names they call there moves before hand, which throws you off and makes you want to give up. But it is good if you are extremly bored with the everyday aerobics DVD's. Although the abs workouts aren't that hard to follow but I mean how can you mess that up anyway right!"
4,"A beautiful, beautiful book","As a student physician with a deep interest in Critical Care Medicine, I've been reading textbooks on the subject whenever I am able to get my hands on any of them. This one is an old book, published in 1992, and I found it in my med school library.My verdict: A classic. It explains, from the foundations up, the physiological and pathophysiological bases of Critical care medicine, in a way I have not found matched (or even approached) in ANY text on the subject. It is a shame that this book is no longer in print. What concise brilliance, what pedagogical excellence...The only drawback, now, is that 10 years after it was written the therapeutic recommendations will, obviosly, be a bit out of date. And yet... what a book."
5,A remarkable overview of the mammals,"Mammalian diversity - and the remarkable adaptations of living and fossil mammals - are the topic of this updated version of the standard text on mammalian biology. New figures and a completely updated systematic treatment characterize this volume, which should become the standard for professionals and the general public interested in the biology of mammals."
1,smut disguised as christianity,"My 15 year old daughter is studying this book in history. Not art history, just history. I saw this book in her room and picked it up when I saw ""Mapplethorpe"" on the cover. My daughter is in a private Christian school so I never in a million years would have thought she'd be learning anything about this freak. I was wrong, she got to learn about Mapplethorpe's photos of men urinating into the mouths of other men. Oh, and Annie Sprinkle's performance art consisting of masturbating then letting customers examine her private parts with a flashlight. I fail to see the reasoning of such graphic descriptions disguised as ""Christian"" information."
4,Waterford Clocks for HPI,"The product is excellent. We purchase them all the time from our local jeweler as anniversary gifts for long term employees.I was VERY VERY disappointed in the packaging. The clocks from the jeweler are packaged in sponge packaging. These clocks were wrapped in tissue paper and were rattling around in the boxes. Additionally, one of the boxes was crushed on the corner making it a little embarrasing to presenting the beautifully wrapped gift and opening the box that was crushed on the corner. The Waterford boxes are always part of the gift itself. And one more thing - the great big bright green [...] sticker on the top of the box - not attractive at all and impossible to remove without ruining the box. My dissatisfaction was not with the product itself, but Amazon.com's handling of the packaging."
3,bow is a little too big,"I just wanted a cute understated flat, but the bow on this shoe makes it look childlike."
1,Poor Quality,"This book is not anything like what it showed on the box. I was hoping for a larger diary and the dimensions in the descriptions were mis-leading. The diary is not that large. The pages are thin like tissue paper. I plan to return this item. It's way overpriced. I have seen better quality at the ""Everything's a $1.00"" store!"
2,don't buy this,If you were just dying to buy somthing you could buy this but it is not a good value and the lock does not work to well it is also very small.
4,A People aArift,Could not find book locally and Amazon was able to get it and it has not been the first time they have helped me find a book.Thanks
1,Not very good,"Will the current crop of politically correct anti-Catholic writers such as McBrien, Cromwell, and Steinfels ever give up? This book is little more than a rehash of the well worn lines spilled out by others in the recent past. My advice -- avoid the ""been there, done that"" feeling."
3,Not for identification!,"I agree with the other reviewers--this is a fantastic book with excellent information. Too often, this kind of ethnobotanical information is lost over time, when the information is not passed down over the generations.I rate the book three stars only as a cautionary to anyone looking for a book which will help them identify medicinal plants--this is not that book! There are some (Some!) black & white photos at the end, but there are no physical descriptions of any of the plants. Curtin does provide the Spanish, English, and Latin name for each plant, but overall, this book is for people who have already identified the plants, and now want to know what to use them for. Since some of the plants discussed are, for example, the garden onion and pinto beans, this may not be as much of a hardship as you might imagine. Her list of ""herbs"" is really quite complete."
4,Good,"DEWALT DW1956 Pilot Point 16-Piece Twist Drill Bit Assortment. Bit work great, cut trough wood like butter, works good on steel. Not for concrete-cement, if you need concrete drilled buy a masonry bit.hope this helps."
1,"Way, WAY too aggressive","I was excited when I received these drill bits about three years ago. Of course any new, sharp drill bits are always exciting. I find myself cursing these drill bits every time I use them. The ""pilot point"" tends to drill into the wood like a cork screw, VERY quickly. Even if you try applying very little pressure, zip, right into the wood. I made the mistake of using these for some finish work on a newel post and the ugly hole I started with looked better then the finished product. I don't even enjoy using these bits for rough work, they just screw into the wood every dang time. Oh, and the ""no slip"" shank is a crock. Only the larger bits have the no-slip shank. When the smaller bits screw into the wood and get stuck, and then you throw the drill into reverse, the bits just spin and spin (granted my Dewalt drill has a keyless chuck).I'm disappointed that these carry the Dewalt name, I think they tarnish an otherwise decent reputation."
2,Too agressive,"After drilling the pilot, the main part of the drill grabs the work piece. With a portable drill, the drill is wrenched out of your hand. With a drill press, the work piece had better be clamped down."
2,Dewalt pilot point drill bits way to aggressive!,"I used this drill bit set a couple of times and really don't like them at all. The bits grab into the wood way too fast making a very rugged hole. I used them today drilling holes in treated, outdoor lumber and the bits would grab, get stuck, forcing me to constantly reverse the drill and back out. Even with soft pressure, they want to force themselves into the wood way too fast jerking the drill out of your hand. The holes were all chewed up and ragged, just awful! I can't imagine using these bits in metal!!!"
2,Once there're gone they're gone...,"They are high quality, idiot proof to use and will drill steel nicely, but they can't be re-sharpened (well mabye...). I've tried by hand but there are to many angles and surfaces to deal with to get them right in a timely manner. Sharpening a regular drill bit is hard enough. If they would make a bit sharpener that would sharpen these (and not cost way more then a drill doc) I would continue to use them all the time and not have to buy new ones. Now I only use them when I'm drilling something vary rounded or when I can't find a small bit to make a pilot hole... not worth the money if buying for a long term use in hard material."
2,screw right on through,"I've never had a drill that grabs so aggressively at the end. Their site claims that ""Pilot Point Tip starts on contact for clean, accurate holes and reduces lock-up on breakthrough"" Balderdash, the large bits 5/16 and up will chew right through shallow holes. You will have very little control on depth when drilling freehand; the bit is design to chew not drill in a controlled manner. I got the 29 piece set and wish I would have returned it after the first bad hole as a result of the aggressive design."
2,Far too agressive!!!,"These bits were fine for utility work but when used for any finish work.. (i.e. mounting hardware or trying to drill w/o going all the way through) they are too hungry for the wood. The larger bits don't actually drill through the wood so much as drill into it like a screw. Even when being extra careful to apply light pressure the drill was twisted out of my hand as the bit tore through my workpiece. while drilling through some Maple Plywood drawer fronts the bit pulled the workpiece up off the table and out of my hand leaving a large chipped out area of veneer on the face of my piece. I also wasn't impressed with the pilot point, the bit still walked. Nothing beats an awl or center punch for accurate drilling"
3,It's OK set of drill bits but not all that great.,"I've owned this set for a year with very infrequent use and half of the bits are useless now. It was sharp at first but dulls pretty quickly although it lasted much longer than the Black and Decker bits. I dropped the largest bit 3/8 from waiste height and it broke in half. Anyway, I'm now shopping for another set of drill bits and Dewalt drill bits are not going to be on my shopping list."
1,Don't buy for hand drill,"You have no control on the feed rate of these drill bits. If you want to drill a pilot hole half way through a wood table top, the bit gets sucked into the wood and the bit will come through the top of your table. I've used drill bits of every type for the last 40 years, I have never seen anything so bad. I have a brand new set, but they are worthless. I only use my old set. If you have a table drill you may be able to get some control with the feed rate of these bits, but for hand tools you will constantly be struggling. I know this point has already been made, but somehow many others have prematurely given these bits a higher rating. These people probably have only used the smallest sizes with harder wood. My old set worked with all types of wood and metals with no problems. Do yourself a favor and keep looking."
3,Drill Bitts are difficult to get in and out,"The bits are decent but they are very difficult to get in and out of the case, I have just ended up leaving them loose in the box which kind of destroys the purpose."
4,good one,"well i bought these shoes after reading the good reviews it had got. And i was not to be disappointed. They are really awesome!! They are real comfy and fit perfectly for every sport i play. I even wear them to office sometimes ;) Though after wearing them for a long stretch of time, i did feel something in my right ankle but it was temporary and maybe that is why i dont want to rate it full 5 star. But they are worth every single penny i spent on them.If you want to get good shoes which not only feel great but look good too, look no further"
1,Bought 2. Both broke.,"I bought two of these cards since they were cheap. My mistake was taking them on my trip to Italy.The cards developed a problem in which my camera said that they were both empty and full at the same time. I couldn't take anymore pictures but I could not review them on the camera as is said that there was nothing on. My card reader could not find any files on the either.Luckily, I was able to recover the files with a data extractor program when I got home, though some of the photos are corrupted.I'm glad that Amazon doesn't have this product anymore. I'll never trust Kingston again with my data."
4,CF card,"I have used the card for several photo's and so far I am happy with it. When I use the HI resolution setting it takes longer to process than I had anticpated, but it is fast enough for what I use it for."
4,2GB-S 2 GB ElitePro CompactFlash Card,"Well this is my first purchase of a digital camera & a compact flash card, so I really have nothing to compare it to. With that said, I think it works fine. I've only used it a few times, but it keeps my data intact. The only thing I didn't like was the writing speed, which is 50X. Next time I'll probably get one that writes faster. The problem comes in when you want to set up to take another shot & the card is still writing the data. Aside from that, it works fine."
3,Late delivery,The product is good.But that delivery was bad.It arrived at July 20.It took about 2weeks.
3,Neither the fastest or most reliable...,"It didn't take long (about 5 sessions) before the CF card errored resulting in my loosing all of the images I had taken not once, but 3 seperate occasions. Granted, I was using a new camera (Rebel XTi) but I hadn't expected to loose images.Thinking about it, I don't remmember if I formated the CF card in the camera I was using it in or through my computer. That would make a diffrence on my review.All in all, there are x133 speed CF cards out there with twice the capacity for not much more. I recommend looking at thoes before getting this specific card."
5,Fast CF Card,"I upgraded from a 512MB Kingston CF card (normal duty/use). This card actually stores images faster than the old card on my Canon S500 digital camera. Plus, the added space made the camera last all day without CF card changes (I was in another country without my laptop to upload pictures to). I bought 2 of these for a 2 week trip. It went well."
5,Great Value,I've used Kingston cards for years with great success. These 2 gig cards are fast and reliable. I'll be buying more to replace our old 512 cards.
5,Very good and cheap CF card,I am using this card for my Dell Axim PDA. I have to say that it has not given me any trouble so far for the last 2 months. The card is working pretty good. I also have an SD card and a USB thumb drive from the same company and they are marvelous. Maybe the transfer rate is slower than the most epensive cards but for the price this is perfect.
1,Shocked,This CF card lasted a little over a year and then after downloading my pictures my Canon camera or my Dell XPS would not recognize the card. The card is unrecognizable to any electronic devices. I do not recommend.
2,Card died at a crucial moment,"I paid a lot of $$$ for this card and expected it to be hassle-free during a trip to Ireland. After I had filled about 1.1 GB on the card it suddently refused to work and my camera would no longer recognize the card. I had to use other cards, and my amount of storage was drastically reduced because I lost those 900MB.However, once I got home the pictures could be retrieved by using a card reader. Somehow about 50 strange folders with jumbled characters had been written to the card, causing the problems (not a camera problem, the card was the problem).This card was noticeably faster than my other Kingston 1GB ""standard"" card, however it was slower than the SanDisk Ultra cards that I brought. I was not pleased with the write speed of any of my kingston cards."
5,Excellent product!!!!,"The Compactflash work fine...the write/read times are very good, i used the card in a tiny workstation with linux OS, and works excellent.i think it is a very good product."
5,Great value,"I have been using this on my Canon Rebel XT for about 9 months. I also have a similar CF card made by Sandisk (Ultra II) which I paid much more. I'm fully satisfied with this and don't see any difference in performance between the two. Btw, I shoot in RAW format and the 8 megapixel RAW files are pretty big."
4,Does the job; good price!,The card works well in my camera and was purchased at a good price compared to several other sources. No problems with delivery.
3,hm,"I don't have any main concerns with this product, however, whenever I open my files and I'm playing music on Windows Media Player, for some reason, it ends up putting my music files into the card without me doing it. I don't know if it's my computer, but it becomes a problem when I try to take pictures and I'm out of space because of all the music that was somehow transferred into the card. The only way I can avoid it is if I don't have windows media player running at the same time."
4,Card not compatible with iPAQ 2495B !!!,"I recently bought this card for my iPAQ! The device doesn't recognize the card at all. The card itself is pretty good and fast and worked fine with all the other devices i tried it with. Eventually I was able to trade the card for a SanDisk 2GB which seems to work without any problems.So, Kingston 2GB CF card is generally a good choice but if you have an iPAQ, make sure you test if your PocketPC is compatible with this card BEFORE buying it.... ;)"
4,"Music Library ""Must Have"".....","This is a great follow-up to Chris Lopez' ""First Stage"" guitar book for beginners. I am in the transition stage; going from beginner to intermediate in my playing and not only do I take lessons one hour per week, but I also go back to these books for the basics. They are easy to follow, and will help you remember the basics of playing that guitar...."
2,"a good idea, poor execution","Mr. Bloom's book is a good idea. Certainly, Nihilism and the lack of respect for tradition, classical education are a problem in our society. I do agree with Mr. Bloom that a university education should be rooted in reading the classics of literature and science. However, his argument was filled with what one reviewer called ""cheap shots"" and his inability to see anything good or positive in popular culture undermined his argument against much of what is going on in popular culture. This book was a disappointment."
5,With Gratitude,"I read this book in my final year of grad school in geology. It explained most reasons for my intellectual and ethical frustration with my entire college experience, in which I had found the academic system to be shockingly and willfully ignorant, totalitarian-restrictive, and corrupt.My college experience was 20% Milovan Djilas, 80% Allan Bloom, capped by a thesis defense out of Martin Luther, all in William Burroughs' unconstituted police state.This book is essential reading for any student who doesn't want his mind destroyed. I am eternally grateful to Allan Bloom for writing it."
1,The immaturity of America's right wing,"No response I can give to Bloom's book would speak against it as well as Lawrence Levine's excellent response, ""The OPENING of the American Mind."" Bloom's not all wrong, but his answers are even more of an easy way out than even the most mindless liberal arts course. Please read Levine's book if you read Bloom's, and decide for yourself who is paying better attention to this country's culture, and who only likes to hear himself talk!"
1,Mr. Bloom is sadly pessimistic about the future of America.,"As a teacher and lover of History, and Social Science I do understand the importance and beauty of freedom of press, mind and opinion. Mr. Bloom shows the reader the ugly side of this in this mass of pessimism. If he has intended it to motivate America's youth, he has failed. If he intended it for the reader to enjoy, he failed. In my opinion, and that of many of my colleagues, Allan Bloom is a bitter, hate filled man, with nothing better to do than write a biography of America's downfalls, ignoring all of the advantages that coincide. Shame on you Allan Bloom!"
1,A point not taken,"(...)He brings forth some perfectly valid and intelligent points, but by the end of it, I had to ask myself, ""so what?"" Bloom tells us we need to control new forms of popular entertainment, and even abolish some of it in order to provide only pure, moral art and entertainment that stimulates the intellect rather than lustful and dishonest emotions.I concur with this reviwer and want to add that Allan Bloom needs to take close look at the literature that he espouses as being some of the most enlightened. It is funny how the literature of the West is loaded with lustful imagery from the Bible to the present. Bloom seems to overlook this. If we are to follow the ""lessons"" of Western literature (whatever they are) then the world is in deep trouble. What he deems as pure, moral art has something to be desired on both fronts. Keep listening to rock n roll and relax or you are going to end up like Bloom and implode."
5,Wow!,An in-depth perspective on how our thinking has changed. Did we open our way of thinking or did we close it? Fantastic read.
2,Wait for the Cliffs Notes,"A meandering, bloviating journey through America's supposed intellectual history (as the author sees it) peppered with digressions, asides, and excursions into ""look how smart I am"" and ""I know so many things."" Your time is better spent reading the countless real intellectuals Bloom references then to accept his second-hand, watered take on them. I give it two stars rather than one because at least he cares about things intellectual, even if he is a prig about it."
2,I threw my copy away halfway through,"As far as I can tell, the late Mr. Bloom was upset that as a professor, he no longer got automatic respect. And he went on about that at some length. I was never convinced that he merited any respect. I thought this book was a waste of his time and my money.Henry Troup"
3,Good Book,"This was a fairly good book, but it was a little hard to grasp the concept at times. Overall very informative."
4,Kindle Version Needs Work,"Kindle users be warned, the Kindle version of Closing of the American Mind has numerous typographical errors. It looks like somebody scanned and OCRed the print version, and never bothered to proofread. ""World War II"" is rendered ""World War H."" The word ""modern"" is almost universally rendered as ""modem.""The Kindle version also lacks a functioning table of contents. Instead, there is a list of hyperlinks several pages into the book. So you have to click ""go to cover"" and then ""next page"" a dozen times to get to what ought to have been the TOC."
2,Nice Intro...,"The best part about this book was the intro. In fact all you need to understand what the late Mr. Bloom was trying to put forth is in the introduction.The rest of the book is a chore to read. The confusing and tedious writing style leads to a lot of re-reading of sentences to figure out the point the author is trying to make. Someone should have counseled Mr. Bloom that ""Brevity is the soul of wit."""
3,Bloom was Alternative?,"I found the book to be quite interesting but somewhat lacking on the elements fundamental to Plato's early principals. If you're not familiar with Bloom, he was openly gay at the University of Chicago for many years. That is only mentioned in the new book Revelstein, but is fascinating considering Bloom's high moral standings and role as preacher/author yet simultaneously held as degenerate by his homosexual behaviour. Quite a contrast, yet society can sort it out. In the end, Bloom can still be a role model for the Christian and Ethical Realm."
1,An ironic play on words...,"This would have been a better title for an Alan Bloom autobiography.I feel the best review on this book I can give is a quote from Jello Biafra's ""High Priest of Harmful Matter"":""I can think of one mind that was so closed that he didn't bother to peer into it before ranting and raving on paper because he'd been welding it shut all those years.""This book could have easily been written by Tipper Gore or Jesse Jackson or the like. It is written to appeal to people who consider themselves ""liberals"" (the yuppie crowd) and parroted exactly what groups like the PMRC and the Moral Majority said about rock music in the eighties.If you believe rock music is the great scapegoat on which to blame all of parents' failures, then this book is for you. For the rest of us, don't be deceived by the title."
2,What does he think he's thinking...?,"Bought this book when it came out and read it cover to cover. Fascinating pile of information, but never did figure out what it was that Bloom thought he wanted to say (except that Brecht and 'Mack' are downright unAmerican--the Augsburger pseudo-patricii don't like Brecht either, so maybe Bloom ought to try A-burg! Good bakeries and butchers there, anyway!). Read the book cover-to-cover 5 more times (dated it insside the cover every time I read it)--that's how fascinating the book is. STILL never did find out what Bloom thought he wanted to say! Don't think I'll read it again.Bored with trying."
5,An excellent command of political and social philosophy,"Prof. Bloom is obviously a very perceptive and intelligent writer, as his books shows. I have read _Closing_ three times, and each time have been astounded by the command he holds of such philosophers as Plato, Nietzsche, Hegel, et al.This book, besides its analysis of the current crisis in Western liberal education, also serves as an excellent introduction to the great Western philosophers. Anyone who finds _Closing_ thought-provoking and interesting should pick up the two great critics of the Enlightenment tradition, Rousseau and Nietzsche. I have read several works by both philosophers, and never failed to be bored by either.I will be attending Queen's University (in Kingston, Canada) next fall as a Humanities major. Thanks to such writers as Prof. Bloom, I now know what to expect while pursuing my study of history. _Closing_ is a book that I hope to read and re-read in the years to come."
3,Not the best critique of relativism,"For a vastly superior critique of relativism turn to C.S. Lewis'The Abolition of Man. ""Men without chests"" abound, a species which Lewis hoped the world would never see. Lewis is an astonishingly powerful thinker, far more intelligent than any room full of the fundamentalists who seem to worship him. A couple of other superior critiques of the foundations of ""MTV/MBA-World"" are: Lewis Mumford, The Myth of the Machine; Jose Ortega y Gasset, The Revolt of the Masses, Man and Crisis. Of course, when you have to spend page after page targeting popular culture, as Bloom does, one feels that it is really too late. I agree with Bloom's premise, it's just that the analysis has been done so much better elsewhere."
3,"Yeah, but so what?","My review is in regards to Mr. Bloom's chapter on the corruption brought about by rock music. I really wish I could find out what it is in rock 'n roll that Bloom says drives an individual towards sexual conquest because I haven't been laid in years. This book reads like an updated version of Plato's ""Republic."" He brings forth some perfectly valid and intelligent points, but by the end of it, I had to ask myself, ""so what?"" Bloom tells us we need to control new forms of popular entertainment, and even abolish some of it in order to provide only pure, moral art and entertainment that stimulates the intellect rather than lustful and dishonest emotions. Restricting freedom and encouraging nothing but cleanliness is also a form of fascism. Bloom would have made a much more convincing book had he written with more compassion than condemnation."
5,Prophetic! A classic examination of American culture!,"Written in 1987, Alan Bloom's book, THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND, has proved to be prophetic in it's description of what society would look like if the trend of leftist education continued in American universities. As Bloom warned, America has become a place where group politics dominate individual rights and the lie of cultural relativism has taken hold. America is in decay.If you are looking for a book that will describe in detail the philosophical underpinnings of today's politically correct society, as well as the truths that established American society, this is the book you should purchase. Bloom is profound and provides ample evidence to document his arguments. You will understand how America arrived to where it is now, and why Americans think the way they do."
2,Dry & mindless prose,"Sorry, I don't get the attraction. On & on, an endless editorial on the American cultural condition, in dry & occasionally mindless prose. Like its contemporary, Cultural Literacy, Bloom's The Closing of... is critical tepidity to make smug ignoramuses feel bright. In other words, it's the best we have. When Bloom tackles pop music, you can feel not only waves of ignorance about his topic but an undercurrent of indifference as well.I finally read this because I thought it might be part of my cultural education. But it wasn't; however, it's legacy remains firm: newspaper commentary & those Sunday morning public affairs programs are packed with the recycled themes of curmudgeonly Mr. Bloom & presented in the same self-absorbed fashion."
3,It's O.K.,Very slow and repedative but quite informative. It's nice to be complete and thorough but when it gets monotonous it makes it a bit of a tough read for some of us.
5,exccelent book,"I have received the book in the condition described by the seller! I recommend the book to whoever wants to discover more about the reason why we are where we are today, as far as education, culture , social life,etc."
5,An excellent work,"this book is amazing. as a college freshman, I was taken aback by this work. His style, a combination of erudite learning mixed with an energized, passionate, no bones writing floored me. The book is phenomenal."
1,A Touch of Frost,"Great show as usual,seems to me they are not as long in running time. Great acting, story, would watch every evening"
5,Inspector Frost,Inspector Frost is always intertaining. I have all 12 seasons of these mysteries and this is my favorite. The inspector is always in trouble with the top brass but he always comes out on top with his great detective work even if he hates the paper work that goes along with the job. I highly recommend this dvd to any one who loves a good mystery.
5,Grows on you,"DCI Frost is the most lovable character you can possibly have. Careless about his personal life, disorganized in his methods, disobedient to authority. But there's another side to this man. That side shows up when his friend George is injured in this episode. His meticulous attention to detail where a case is involved has many around him wondering how he does it so effortlessly. When I had first started watching this series, I found myself occasionally nodding off due to the slow pace of everything... the title music, the scenes, the dialogue... everything is unhurried and relaxed. It is only after I had watched 2-3 episodes that I began appreciating this series- it grows on you."
5,I love them!,"I made a sound purchase when I picked this set up. I wish to encourage others to pick up a set or two,also, depending on one's family and personal needs. The price was definitely affordable."
5,Great product and gift for the money,"These pans look like pottery, not your normal shine of corningware. I'd be proud to give them for any gift, and have found multiple uses for the casserole with a lid, and the big lasanga or cake pan. The 2 small ones are identical and nice to make a matching serving set."
4,Get the Skinny on the War Against Weightism,"Margo Maine has done it again in her book Body Wars. I learned how to connect myself with various groups working for a better community, to recognize examples of brainwashed thinking in myself and to do something about it. Margo Maine is an intelligent and empassioned researcher and activist and I am glad she continues to regale us with her comprehensive style and life-changing material."
2,"Great potential, great disappointment.","This book should be applauded for pointing out things about today's media and culture that many people overlook. It provides a pretty good well of facts about women in the media to draw upon. Having said that, the level of analysis taken in this book is disappointingly superficial, and appears to be motivated more by shock and awe than honesty. Main fails to make several important disctinctions (in my opinion), and I fear that this book may perpetuate its own set of misconceptions about health and beauty that are no less dangerous than those perpetuated by the culture it exposes."
2,purely factual,"I think this book would be good for a parent or teacher- it is basically a reference guide. In fact, it seemed to me to be nothing more than a compilation of ""facts"" and statistics, most of which just underline what is already common knowledge. It provides a very basic overview of the various ways we are all manipulated and controlled by body ideals and expectations. BUT I would not recommend it for someone who is actually trying to do some healing. There is no emotion or guidance in this book; it seems to just hold up these facts as reason enough that you shouldn't be so caught up in the ""body wars."" A poorly written disappointment."
1,Don't be decieved!,I viewed a 20' West Coast Chopper Bike in a local store but figured I would compare to online shopping. Since there is no image available I was unable to compare a visual. But how many different versions of this bike could there be. Apparently a vast difference at least in this on vs the one I saw. The one I saw look alot like the Stingray but had the West Coast logos. Very cool looking. This one looked nothing like either. It is a horible cross between a Stingray and a regular looking bike. I ended up returning this bike and purchasing the Stingray which I should have done the first time. It was a $22 (shipping cost) lesson. Learn from my mistake. Don't assume it's what you want unless you see it.
5,west coast chopper bike,i bougt a west coast chopper and i am verry satisfied with it. it rides very well. and if you are looking at buying one it's worth the money.
4,Perfect for the workplace...,"if you're not embroiled in the MP3 craze. I recently purchased this radio for the second time (for my girlfriend) because it is probably the best stereo out there for the workplace. As the price indicates, this isn't a boombox which you're going to carry on your shoulder down the street but rather a light to medium range sounding box which is compact in size (fits great on the workdesk) and won't annoy the coworkers. I would suggest buying this to ease your time at work and only if you've just about lost your mind if your company's central air system is driving you nuts!"
4,Light-weight bird identification,"This is a folded, laminated brochure. It is filled with bird images on both sides. The birds are grouped according to type, e.g. wading birds and birds of prey. It helps if you have some idea about what type of bird you're looking for. Often you also need to be able to gauge the size of the bird in front of you to be able to say exactly which one it is.Surprisingly enough it has so far covered every single bird I've seen in the Bay Area and along the Northern and Central Coast. It would be nice to have a little more than the 3-5 words that accompany each bird. But then again, this leaflet I'll actually take with me. The weighty tomes with lots of bird info tend to stay at home on the shelf. Considering how often I've consulted it, I'd say it's definitely worth the price."
3,Review!,"It's a textbook. As far as textbooks go, this one is not so bad, but it's not like I'm reading it for fun."
5,Excellent,"This is a great book about management and organizations. In particular I liked the two final chapters very much. The second to last chapter deals with strategy, which is really the theme of the whole book. The final chapter is on globalization, described in a style that makes one think of general systems theory. It's a book with a good moral."
2,Good Idea,"I think this is a great idea for travel. But unfortunately I am not so keen on the fact that it is made out of vinyl. Vinyl has come under some heat as to its safety. I have only recently discoved this. But it makes sense, the strong smell that comes from it can't be good for you and especially your baby. I wish they could make it out of somthing else- otherwise it is a great idea."
3,it's ok,"After the opening instrumental kicks things off to an exciting start, the energy goes way down. Apparently many blues fans don't want their music to be too vital, but I personally felt that on most of this cd, Williams sounds like he hadn't been playing much, rusty, compared to to the sure-handed work of his first incarnation in the fifties. His singing is passable, but if he wasn't a legendary guitarist, no one would be listening. Williams had been doing no gigging at the time of this recording, nor for decades up until this point. He since has put together an excellent band of his own, and they've toured extensively. If his soon to be recorded next cd is a reflection of these changes, it should be a much more worthwhile experience./////1/12/06: Jody seems to be retired again, for a while in fact. Any word out there?"
2,Short but sweet!,"In my quest to own a full collection of 'Giant Monster' films from Juassic Park to Amazing Colossal Men I was overjoyed to find I could now view this legendary 'porn + fantasy' movie, similar in style to 'Flesh Gordon'.This re-edited and retitled movie (originaly called King Dong), which now only lasts 40 minutes, gives us a chance to see what you do with just a few dollars for a budget. A couple on fair stop motion dinosaurs and a giant gorilla along with some nice sequences using matt work are quite good to look at.The acting is mostly poor and post dubbed..But what brings this release down is the dreadful DVD quality which looks as if it's been copied from an old video tape. Great, great pity"
2,or 2.5 stars for lost nonadventure isle,"film q, length, fx, monsters&variety & story-rather lousy. it had pleisiosaur-whatever, kong and t rex is all i can remember. film is way overpriced no matter what and they cut out better younger actor and its extended scene."
3,Not all here... For personal reasons.,"According to another reviewer's list of titles for this DVD there is no ""99"" Interestingly enough, the CD that the title and artwork for this DVD came from does have ""99"" listed. I heard that this may be due to Steve Lukather's hatred of the song. Oh well, Bummer for us music lover's!"
2,"no 5.1... then, no star","Totally disappointed by the lack of appropriate audio. It's no longer 1985... and we have technology available that allows listening to a much better quality than just plain vanilla stereo. Toto members should seek out those responsible for this weak mix, and fasten their heads to a guitar amp for a concert or two... sorry guys, I love U, but your producers blew it... and I have too many glass coasters already!!"
3,Good collection. No update.,"This is an excellent video collection, one I've had on VHS for years. However, would have enjoyed it more if the producers had taken the time to add some clips for other songs which were not included on the original release, as well as some of Toto's more recent videos."
5,FOR THE MUSIC LOVERS A MUST TO HAVE,Only Journey Greatest Hits can be better than this DVD. This is a must to have for any true music lover. My rate is 8 stars. These guys are from the time musicians needed to be musicians. Lukather you are an amazing guitar player and singer. Rosanna was really a masterpiece. Long life to all of you.
1,not happy,"The quality was only 'ok'. The original recordings have a better spatial field. Don't buy this DVD if you love Toto's music and have never seen them in concert or in a video! You will be disappointed with the guys and the quality of the videos!After having said all that, I LOVE Toto and highly recommend their music. Very talented group --- in the studio! ;)"
5,"London Bleeding, London Burning","This book is a love letter to the city of London, from several points of view. I normally don't like the books and movies that shift between several people, as one story usually is stronger than the others. (See my intense dislike of _Infinite Jest_ in spite of liking Foster Wallace's nonfiction.) However, here the main character is the city, not its inhabitants. The characters are just transients on the surface of the dynamic city. Nicholson has a character say it better than I just did, but when I wanted to make a not to myself about the central theme of the work, I had no pencil close. It was worth while, but remember my views are idiosyncratic and subjective. Read it and we might have something to to talk about."
3,Better books available,"I hesitate to write this because I respect the author's work and fully endorse it. The reason for the three stars is that this book is extremely light in the pants. For anyone who's studied after death, near death, OBEs, psychic phenonmenon, remote viewing, and so on, don't bother with this book.I expected far, far more after reading the overview, but what I found was that I learned almost nothing here. The book is also written in the style of the scientist who finds that there's more to the universe than the physical, which is really old and tired to most readers.If you've never read anything on any of these subjects, you'll enjoy the book, but it's still a very light rendition of the subject matter."
2,Disappointment and bored in Mass.,"After reading Dr. Morse and Paul Perry's wonderfully insightful and inspiring books, ""Closer to the Light"" and ""Transformed by the the Light"", I was disappointed and mostly bored with this didactic rehashing. Donald W. Mitchell's excellent review was actually more interesting than reading the book itself. Buyer beware."
2,Right temporal lobe?,"This book is written from a scientific perspective to explain paranormal things. The book itself tries to discredit God. These paranormal occurring are not so paranormal after all. The bible explains everything in reference to this theme. The problem is in how people understand supernatural phenomenon. In scientific minds, there is not God connection to these events or whatsoever , for them it has to be the right temporal lobe located in the brain the one responsible for these strange events. For those who knows God , these so called"" Paranormal events"" are not paranormal in anyway. As far as for reincarnation, I would better call it spiritual beings dwelling in other bodies or spiritual possession, in most cases for the worse."
1,This author was arrested.,"I haven't read his books on near-death experiences of children. But it's worth noting that Dr. Morse has been arrested (as of Aug 9, 2012) for ""waterboarding"" his daughter repeatedly over two years, as a method of punishment. He has a prior history of arrests involving child maltreatment, according to Delaware's local newspaper."
2,"Unless you're a scientists, this book is too deep for you...",This book is very scientific and deep. Was a hard read and I don't think I ever finished it nor got anything valuable out of it.
5,Thought Provoking,"Dr. Melvin Morse gives us one of the best books that I have ever read. Thought provoking and detailed. How do humans connect to God? Is it through the brain? What of near death experiences and how are they similar? Is there proof of past lives? Do they connect? What is our link to the universe, or our position? Many topics are explored in this book in detail.This book has to rate as one of the best on the subject of Paranormal Science. A must read for anyone who has an interest in the subject, or to someone who may be curious as to what this subject is all about. But this book, open your mind."
5,To each his own,"Music just doesn't get any better than Pet Sounds. I say this even though I'll never make a dime from the album. Pet Sounds changed my life, made it better in a way no other recording ever has or, likely, ever will."
2,Whats the big deal?,"I'm sorry, but it all sounds the same! Putting this in the same league with ANYTHING the beatles ever did is insane. Just what is so great about this I will never understand. Rubber Soul it is NOT!"
3,Very Nice,"This is some ways is typical MOR '60s music,similar to Simon & Garfunkel in a way.Sweet,poppy,often profound,but trapped in a musical timewarp.I would recommend it to misty eyed romantics and the like,also fans of Sgt Pepper,Rubber Soul et al.But having said this,objectively speaking this CD is not up with the best ever,although probably one of the sixties.So if buying this album for the first time,dont expect too much,just a laid back light pop album,otherwise you may come away disappointed.Just think Simon & Garfunkel or Mamas & The Papas and you have the idea.Just dont expect a Sgt Pepper or Ok Computer and you will probably love this fluffy masterpiece!"
2,the beach monkees,"after hearing this was better than the beatles,pink floyd,etc. i bit on the hype, only to find out that brian didn't write the songs and the beach boys didn't play the music, i might as well have bought a partridge family album,oh well, on to the music, some good songs, and a lot of very forgettable ones. it's too bad that beach boys fans have to be so rude and insulting of other peoples musical tastes' it just make them look like a bunch of sour grapes. i happen to like the kinks, but that doesn't mean the rest of the world has to."
2,These Pet Sounds need potty training,"One of the greatest albums of all time? Please! This is a perfect example of how popular opinion can snowball into pure nonsense. I can name 100 albums that are much better than this droning, boring and highly overrated icon.It is very much like saying that ""Citizen Kane"" is the greatest movie of all time just because it has been said so many times that it becomes gospel and people avoid being honest in fear of being labeled as ""out of touch""."
2,The most overrated album of all time.,"I just don't get the hype over this album. It's got a few good songs, but that's about it."
3,i don't know much about music but i know what i like,"in my humble music-illiterate opinion of course 'sgt. pepper' and 'pet sounds' are interesting but they're also not 'equally' as good. i've listened to many pop albums going back to the fifties and there are a whole bunch of them that i prefer to the aforementioned because the music's more appealing as i sip my beer (i think some lsd would probably help those to get through 'pepper' and 'sounds' more than once). and the folks who decry that 'pet sounds' is the best album? go to the zoo, take out a recording device and make a record - you folks will love it i'm sure...signed, still stuck on good MUSIC p.s. brian wilson is a great talent that much i'm sure of (in my opinion)"
2,Surfer boy stays home and cries about puppy love,"Maybe if I hadn't heard the hype, I could have enjoyed this for what it is, an OK Beach Boys album that has one or two greatest-hits-caliber songs. Unfortunately I went in expecting something on the artistic level of the Beatles at their best, which this is not. True there is a consistency of voice, but it's that of a whiny teenager with girlfriend problems, enough to hold my interest for about one song. The lyrics consist of commonplace rhyming conversational prose, totally lacking in imagery, metaphor and anything else that separates verse from poetry. The music has that distinctive Brian Wilson sound, pleasant and ingratiating. Breaking up the meter or, adding accordions, barking dogs and train sound effects doesn't alter that. If you love the Beach Boys, buy Pet Sounds. If you only just like the Beach Boys buy their Greatest Hits instead."
3,Great Album - Missing Mono Version and Extra Track,"I am rating the MP3 download version, not the audio CD version or the album itself. Everyone knows this is one of the greatest albums ever made. The MP3 download version does NOT include the original mono versions of the songs that are included on the CD version. It also doesn't include the bonus track ""Hang On To Your Ego"" that is in the CD version of ""Pet Sounds 40th Anniversary"" and most re-released Pet Sounds albums. All that being said, it is hard to beat the special download price."
5,Beach Boys CD purchase,Overall positive transaction; good communication and status reports from seller; the CD is just what I wanted.Thanks Amazon for helping.
4,A really beautiful CD,"I like the Beach Boys, but I have to admit that I prefer their earlier California style hits (e.g., Fun, Fun, Fun) and I'm not a big fan of 60s music. Nevertheless, ""Pet Sounds"" is undeniably a beautiful CD that still sounds great today. ""Sloop John B"" and ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" were top 10 hits in the US and ""God Only Knows"" and ""Caroline, No"" cracked the top 40, but all the songds sound great. Brian Wilson's voice has never sounded more beautiful and the harmonies are near-perfect. As a bonus, ""Hang on to Your Ego"" is included (it was recorded at the same time, but not released). It's a great song and may be familiar to alt rock fans via a remake by Frank Black. The liner notes are also terrific and include comments from Brian Wilson as well as a song by song description. Great CD!"
5,"If ""Sir"" Paul McCartney, why not ""Sir"" Brian Wilson","I could go on forever about ""Pet Sounds"" and many other Beach Boys/Brian Wilson gifts, but I'd only be repeating what so many others have already said. If only this country had the equivelant of ""Knighthood"" as Great Britain does, then certainly Sir Brian is as worthy as Sir Paul. I will simply say: Thank You Mr. Wilson. You have given us all the gift of melody and harmony unsurpassed! Your music is a national treasure!"
3,"5 stars for music, 3 for DVD-Audio release","What a disappointment is the new DVD-Audio version of this classic. I had been looking forward to it for sometime, only to find that it's not much of an improvement over the much cheaper 1996 CD release (which includes both the original mono and new stereo mixes of all tracks). Sadly, I must recommend sticking with the CD..."
3,"5 Star Album, 1 star for stereo remixing","I was rather excited and eager to listen to a stereo mix of Pet Sounds. Other stereo remixes of Beach Boys tracks.albums have proven excellent, especially for those with surround sound speakers or for headphone listening. But I forewarn all Pet Sounds aficianados, stay clear of this stereo mix. Alot of the songs are missing vocals, double tracked or otherwise (Still Believe in Me, Wouldnt It BE Nice) and in general it is WAY overmixed. There is too much echo, and alot of the times the orchestrations/instrumentations drown out the vocals. I hate to give Pet Sounds anything less then 5 stars, but this stereo mix is rather unlistenable for long time Pet Sounds fans. First time listeners accustomed to stereo sound won't complain, until they compare the stereo tracks to the mono mixes. I guess it all comes down to that old cliche, ""If it aint broke, dont fix it."""
1,Worst Pet Sounds version ever,"Read the other reviews carefully - this edition of my favorite album is a disgrace. The sound is terribly dead, has drop-outs and plenty of tape hiss, and the flimsy packaging is hopeless. I have Pet Sounds in at least a dozen different formats, and this one is the WORST sonically. The gold disc does not matter at all in this case. Stick with the DCC, the reissued vinyl LP, or the 40th Anniversary mono/stereo editions. Pet Sounds Sessions box set is also a must-have, and even the ""bonus"" mono-only disc in the Pet Sounds Sessions box set sounds better than this. Pass on this one and spend your money elsewhere."
5,Outstanding! A landmark in musical history,This album is definetly a milestone in the history of music. Their harmonys are obviously legendary and there songs such as `God only knows` really shows what perfection sounds like.
4,God Only Knows,"God only knows what Pet Sounds would have sounded like without the Beatles. Its a very good album, and I'm sure, at the time, it was groundbreaking. But for all this Beatle-bashing, I don't get it. Its obvious the Beatles were influenced by the Beach Boys, and many others. WHO WASN'T. By the same token, the Beatles influenced all in return (with interest). Funny thing is, Pet Sounds is widely praised BECAUSE of the Beatles. Paul McCartney never skips a chance to praise it. The Beach Boys(actually Brian Wilson) should be very proud of this achievement, but the Beatles have a few other albums they can hang their hat on. Still, it's much better than any of that Stones garbage."
1,Audiophile version?,"Sorry I have to say that this does not sound like best version of this beautiful album, even it is marketed as a ""audiophile/gold/superhyper"" recording. Somehow it sounds a bit ""muddy"" to me."
5,Great Tunes,"""God only knows"" is my favorite. The writing of the songs and singing is phenomenal and this group has got to be the best from the last 50 years."
3,Didn't meet my expectations,"Now I am a fan of all music and so I bought Pet Sounds with great expectations. What I got was a nice CD but nothing I would call extravagent. I mean ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" ""God Only Knows"" and ""Sloop John B"" are all good songs, but I mean I don't agree it is the best of the 60s (but then again that is just opinion). There is a lot of arguments about The Beatles not being a real band and just studio musicians. All I can tell you is that when I sit down and listen to Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road or Revolver I feel the music and it touches me it makes me feel good and Pet Sounds didn't do that to me. The Beatles are my favorite band, but I'm not knocking The Beach Boys or Brian Wilson. It's like comparing Playground Basketball to the NBA. Sorry Brian."
4,No one mentions this.,"I am a big Beach Boys fan and would give this album five stars but there is something about this album that no one seems to point out that makes me prefer a different BB album like ""Today"" over Pet Sounds. Every song seems to be overly drenched in studio reverb. Maybe it's the Phil Spector influence at work here but some of these songs sound to me like they are coming from the bottom of a well. And the modern stereo versions seem to exaggerate this quality also. Instead of a stereo mix I'd rather hear a ""dry mix"". Some of Carol Kaye's picked bass parts as lovely and melodic as they are sound like the bass amp was distantly miked from the back of a cement parkade. Just not my cup of tea and just my opinion."
5,In the top ten of all time,"Like most albums, this album takes about three listens to fully enjoy. But what an album! The vocal harmonies are smashing, the instrumental tracks are interesting, and there is not a single boring moment! There is an obvious lack of guitar, but it doesn't matter much to me. This is a classic in its own right, and it definitely should not be compared with Sgt. Pepper. Two different album, two different bands. It's all about taste. Just forget about thinking which is better and enjoy the sounds of both. Oh, and a reviewer mentioned how this wasn't even in the top ten of '66. Completely false. This beats Face to Face (barely), Velvet Underground and Nico, and Fifth Dimension, although those albums were wonderful too. Let's just say '66 was a great year for rock and leave it at that."
2,I may be missing something,"First, I love the Beach Boys. I think they have some great stuff. I also love the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeplin, old blues, Black Sabbath, and new rock, etc. I am very open minded when it comes to music. I love classical, jazz, opera, every genre. But I apparently have some deficiency when it comes to this album. Although there are a few great songs, I find the album mostly aweful and unlistenable. It is beyond me how some have put this as the greatest rock album of all time. Maybe one day I will wake up and see what I'm missing, but I doubt it."
2,"Sorry, I dont agree with all the hoopla","I thought this was going to take me back to the hey-day of the group, but it didnt. The only tracks that I loved were the ones I already owned in the beach boys best songs cds. I found this album an attempt to recapture what they had, and in my humble opinion, its a dismal bust. The new stuff was dreary, melodramatic, and overwrought. No rythm, no purpose, just cry in my beer stuff that left me wondering why in the world I ever bought this to begin with. but i do know why! I wanted that past. sadly, the past is gone."
2,"""THE MOST OVERRATED RECORDING IN ROCK HISTORY""","I share the same confusion as the reviewer a few entries below me - what's the big deal here? To hear so many people champion this recording as the greatest rock album ever seems ludicrous to me. I bought this CD a few months ago and listened to it several times, hoping it would ""grow on me"", as many of my favorite discs have. I finally gave it to my father-in-law, hoping he would derive some pleasure from it. If you're looking for truly original and inspiring classic rock, stick to ""Rubber Soul"", ""Tonight's the Night"", ""Astral Weeks"", ""Born to Run"", ""Exile on Main St."", or any album by the Velvet Underground."
5,the best way to show all that is possible with music,Simply one the best albums ever! Ill write a longer review later.
3,"Unusually strong for 1966, but less so out of context","Any non-compilation album with Wouldn't It Be Nice, God Only Knows, Sloop John B, and Caroline No is a stand out, whether from '66 or not. To put this in a class with a Beatles album, though, is difficult. I should mention, though, that I never heard this until last year, but Beatles' albums from this period grew on me a lot faster than Pet Sounds. If this influenced Paul McCartney, then it's historical importance is certainly significant, but is it as consistently listenable as Rubber Soul or Revolver? Of course, Brian Wilson had little songwriting help while Lennon & McCartney had each other, so his accomplishment as a songwriter is on par with theirs, at least for this album. Compared to 95% of non-compilations from '66, this is outstanding."
3,Influential and important? Sure. Great? Not so much.,"Like many other ""classics"" from its era, Pet Sounds simply hasn't stood the test of time, not because its sounds weren't ground-breaking for when it came out, but because most of the songs really haven't aged well. ""Wouldn't it Be Nice"" and ""God Only Knows"" are absolute classics, but the best (and best known) of the remaining tracks, ""Sloop John B"", isn't even an original composition, and there's a reason that ""Caroline No"" is probably the only remaining track that non-owners of the album will have ever heard. This album is far more important for the influence it would have on The Beatles as a studio band than as a musical statement by Brian Wilson: it's certainly not unpleasant to listen to, but the second-greatest album of all time, as recently selected by Rolling Stone Magazine? Absurd."
3,very melancholy,I was looking for the upbeat poppy beach boys...this is definetely not it...b vitamins... st johns wort...psych drugs...anyone?
3,"Other than the hits, why is this considered such a landmark?","The hits from this album are certainly top-class pop/rock, as are most of the Beach Boys hits. But to compare this favorably to almost any Beatles album is way off the mark. 90% of the tracks on any Beatles album would have been ""hits"", the songwriting/production/etc. is that consistently solid. Maybe Pet Sounds represented a significant departure for the Beach Boys, but it pales next to what the Beatles were making then (or previously or subsequently, for that matter). No matter what Paul McCartney says either."
5,Best of Pet Sounds,"As a record collector,somehow I'd previously overlooked this all-important ""Concept"" album,until recently acquiring a version of ""love is here"" in association with a project I'd been working on.The Wilson influence was immediately apparent and so a copy of ""Pet Sounds"" I had to have!Oddly,it wasn't until getting to the stereo versions of the songs that the true brilliance came out,and so by track 24,my justification for buying this album was justified.Fantastic!"
2,Nostalgia triumphs over reality,"I've listened to this album a number of times - I own this album. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. I simply don't understand why it's raved as one of the best albums of all time because it's so outdated. It's so cheesey and it gets boring. The songs are fun and poppy, but really get thin after a few listens. Why does it get such high reviews? It is important historically, but I sincerely believe that the legend is far too inflated for such a bland bit of 60s pop.I guess I'm unimpressed by Brian Wilson."
4,Good Listening,"OK OK OK....I was reading most of the reviews and they all say about the same thing....this is the greatest album of all time, so on and so forth. I actually bought this album because I was intrigued about the Beach Boys after watching the miniseries about them on abc. Yes, I think this is a good album but I really don't think that any album should be classified as the best. As for the Beatles, which I have to mention because they are my personal favorite group, they were influenced by this album. It might seem that I am biased against the Beach Boys, because I do like their music, but I think that the Beatles' material has more of a greater listening quality. Truthfully, one has to be in a certain mood to listen to ""Pet Sounds"" and really enjoy it. But this is a good album."
5,"My 2 cents on Pet Sounds, and competitors for ""greatest""","Everyone else here seems to be doing it, so here I go. First, I think the title of greatest album and greatest rock album are totally different. Pet Sounds does not rock as much as the Beatles albums thrown into this discussion (Rubber Soul, Revolver, SGT Pepper). Of those, I'd say Revolver rocks the most, easily earning the title of greatest rock album. Then you've got Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper .....bringing new sounds and concepts into popular music, wonderfully orchestrated. I consider both of these to be art more than rock, though they do have their moments. I'd call it a toss up, if it werent for the one track that stands outside of the ""performance"" of SGT Pepper's LHCB.....A Day in the Life. That album closer is enough to push SGT Pepper over the edge as the greatest (general) music album ever recorded. As much of a genius as Brian Wilson was, he was no substitute for the combined creative efforts of John, Paul, George, and Ringo."
5,You can never have too much Pet Sounds,"Pet Sounds is the ultimate aural experience. I enjoyed the 5.1 Surround mix. I sat in a chair, closed my eyes and drifted into a soundscape of textured notes and voices.I already own the box set, the 1st CD edition and even an original vinyl copy. It seems that every time I upgrade I am never disappointed.Purist seem to like the Mono version of the album. I love the all the sounds that scream out of the stereo version.If you do not have the box set or the other stereo Cd, I would highly recommend this set. It covers everything Pet Sounds that you will want. If you do not care for the interviews and film, you will appreciate the surround mix on the DVD. The box set is more for Brian wilson Fanatics(Myself included) and collectors."
1,Very Few Good Songs,"In my opinion, there are very few good songs on this CD. I have only used it a couple of times. It is not worth using for a couple of good songs."
5,pet sounds,"almost as good as sgt pepper. one of there better lps. all good tracks, so of had good vibractions on the record."
5,its a frikkin classic,"just buy it, it's their best album and has many great songs. you really cant go wrong unless you hate the beach boys, and in that case you know what to do."
3,Disappointing release,"Whether people want to admit it or not, the mono version is the canonical version of this album. It is really the mono mix that needs to be in high resolution, not the stereo mix. The stereo mix is okay and it sounds pretty good in high resolution but it doesn't matter. The fact is that it is not the same album due to the number of concessions had to be made.Sorry, folks, the 5.1 Dolby Digital mix is a waste of space. I'm not thrilled with how the surround was used but it almost doesn't matter. When you turn up the volume, parts of it are downright abrasive. I don't know if the problem is in the mix, the mastering, or the Dolby Digital compression but I don't care. Pet Sounds should never be abrasive!I suppose we'll have to wait for the 50th Anniversary for this album to be released properly. Any release that does not have the original mono mix with the best sound quality possible is not worth the bother. We might as well stick with the earlier versions."
5,Pure and Simple Genius,"The hallmark pop album of all time. If you dont own it buy it. Mono, or stereo, its just too great to be without. A must have."
3,"Not judging the music, but the DVD Audio edition","I won't go into the music - it is fantastic. Just some comments to the DVD Audio. First: It will play on any DVD Video player and it has surround sound. However, you have to possess a DVD Audio compatible player if you want to benefit from the high res stereo or surround sound on high end equipment. (On cheap Home Cinema Systems or Stereos, it doesn't make much difference). To my ears, the surround mix leaves something to be desired. On one side it is great to listen to the heavenly harmonies coming from all around you in the living room. On the other side, it sounds - no, it feels - different to the original mono mix of Brian Wilson. Maybe it's just me but this is one LP I rather listen to in its original mono mix than the souped up stereo and surround mix.Also, it seems as if the DVD Audio format is loosing ground compared to the competing SACD format. But I might be wrong here. If I'm right though, this might become a collector's item one day"
4,Pet Sounds,"Pet Sounds being The Beach Boys 11th studio album and their 1966 release and singles released on the album were ""Caroline No"", ""Wouldn't it be nice"", ""Sloop John B"" and ""God Only Knows"". Yes it is a good album, however to compare it with ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" does not work for me as I consider Beatles to be far superior. Even Rolling Stones has made better albums then this. However, do not get me wrong this is a good album, but not as good as many would have you believe. The booklet is very nice with many photographs, liner notes written by Brian Wilson and David Leaf. No lyrics are included but we get a list of whom plays what on each track. 4/5."
1,Not close,"Pet Sounds is OK. Not close to being the greatest album at all. The only really good songs are Wouldn't It Be Nice, God Only Knows and Sloop John B. I do not see the impact nor the hysteria that some Beach Boy fans see in this album. A lot of the other songs seem to be a throw together of random melodies and dreary rhythmic structures. If one continues to compare the Beach Boys to the Beatles, stop it... There is no comparison; Lennon and McCartney still rule in the composition arena of popular music.Carlos"
2,The most overrated album in history!,"Never a Beach Boys fan I had to listen to this much hyped album after hearing rave reviews. What a dissapointment. I just don't get it. ""God only knows"" is indeed a masterpiece, but the rest of the album is filled with boring music that does nothing for me. I've tried multiple listenings to make sure I'm not missing anything, but the plain truth is that this album stinks. I was expecting some deep music as described by some Beach Boys fans, but the best use I can get out of this album is using it as a coaster. In a word, BORING."
3,harmless little harmonies,"It's got some decent moments, but really folks, trying to compare the beach boys to the beatles is trying to compare sandlot stickball to the world series!It's just not real to try, and even brian wilson said in a interview when sergeant pepper came out ""we knew there was know way we could compete with the beatles"". This is a ok album, but to say it's the best ever is pure insanity!"
2,Maybe I had to have been there...,"But I think this album kinda sucks.The only song I like is ""God Only Knows"". I might like ""Wouldn't it be nice"", if it hadn't been killed by a million plays on commercials and movies.Ho-hum. I like the Beatles a billion times better, if we're comparing."
1,BIG disappointment.,"Having previously bought the 1987 mono remaster, and the 'Pet Sounds Sessions' box set, I was anticipating yet another improvement in the sound quality of this wonderful album. But my excitement turned to disappointment as soon as I listened to the stereo version of 'Wouldn't It Be Nice'. The high frequencies are heavily filtered, and the bass simply isn't there. The rest of the stereo version is an improvement over the previous stereo version, but the fact that the first track is so bad completely spoils my enjoyment of the album.I don't care about the surround sound mixes - extended resolution stereo is what I am interested in - so this disc has been an expensive waste of money for me.Who messed up, Capitol records?"
3,Best Album of all time? C'mon!,"A nice Beach Boys album. Several great tracks (Wouldn't It Be Nice, Sloope John B., God Only Knows, Carolina No), some fillers with excrutiating banality, and then some silly games with a sound effects machine. If you like the Beach Boys, go at it. But the best album of all time? Please. Doesn't hold a candle to Revolver, the White Album, Wish You were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, The Joshua Tree, Actung Baby, Who's Next, Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road, Led Zepplin IV, etc. etc. It's embarrassing to make that claim for a album that is half fluff and 2/3rds pretension."
2,THE most overrated album in history!!!!,"I bought this CD mainly because of its critical acclaim. When I first listened to it I was completely shocked at how ordinary it was--the word that comes to mind is CALLOW. Listen to the over-the-top wretchedness of Mike Love's so-called singing on 'That's Not Me' and you'll understand what I mean. Brian Wilson's comment in the liner notes that this particular song was so great that he 'couldn't get enough listens' must mean that he's actually deaf in BOTH ears when it comes to judging Mr. Love's ability. There are actually some good songs on this album, however-- 'Sloop John B', 'God Only Knows', and 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' are rightly called classics. But to compare it in the same breath to 'Sergeant Pepper' is ludicrous."
5,..................................[speechless],Most definitely the best album ever recorded by man. Essential
5,Love you Brian,"If I could listen to the Beach Boys in a club I would have a chance to kiss a girl listening to ""Caroline no"". Too sad..."
2,I don't get it!!!,"I can't believe what I'm seeing. I am 36 years old and have been a fan of rock and pop music for at least 26 of those. I had barely even heard of ""Pet Sounds"" until recently. The Beach Boys sound, and yes, including ""Pet Sounds,"" which, yes, I have listened to, has always been and always will be nothing but bubble gum surfer music. When did society decide that this mediocre piece of fluff was greater than truly legendary fare such as Sgt. Peppers, Dark Side of the Moon, Exile on Main Street, Highway 61 Revisited, and on and on and on?"
2,Average album with one great song,..that song being god only knows a great song. Wouldn't it be nice is cool though not great. The rest is a mish mash of bubble gum boy loses girl pop and pointless instrumentals. This was influenced by Rubber Soul but really misses the boat big time. The thing is brian wilson was a good songwriter of surf pop tunes but couldn't compete with lennon/mccartney when it came to deep timeless pop. As for best album this album probably isn't even among the best ever. The people who rate this album highly either have an agenda or like ho-hum music.
3,harmless little harmonies,"When released in 1966, this album got as high as no 10 on the charts, and faded from the top 40 after 21 weeks.Wouldn't it be nice got to no 8 , and God only knows got to no 39. This is o.k., but only just that! This album is not a earth shattering release. The beatles ""sergeant pepper"" no 1 for 15 weeks and on the charts for 63 weeks was a earth shattering event! Listen to this if you like, but when your ready to move on , sergeant pepper, rubber soul, abbey road, revolver, the white album, dark side of the moon, led zeppelin 1-5, and on and on await you!"
3,I don't understand what the hype is?,"For some reason, I cannot figure out why this is considered by many to be the greatest album of all time. This is always compared to the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's but I think Sgt. Pepper track for track can anhilate this album. There is no track on Pet Sounds that can compare with ""A Day in the Life"". On Pet sounds I only really found 3 tracks that are strong, the rest were very weak. On Sgt. Pepper I would say 12 out of the 13 are remarkable. I really hope people stop even putting Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper in the same sentence because the Beatles are by far the greatest band ever. The Beatles are the Greatest Band Ever!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Concept?,"I keep hearing that ""Pet Sounds"" is a concept album. Can someone explain to me what the concept is? ""Bookends"" by Simon & Garfunkel was a concept album about aging and the fear of aging. But, ""Pet Sounds"" seems to be simply a collection of songs, some great, some not so great."
2,Definitely Overrated,"According to one of the reviews here, Pet Sounds is ""most definitely the best album ever recorded by man."" This is truly sad. There are, at last count, about 238,481 recordings in the history of music that are more interesting, entertaining and/or influential than Pet Sounds.Don't get me wrong - I like the Beach Boys as much as the next band that plays easy-on-the-ears pop music. The Brian Wilson biography on A&E a few months back was both sweet and sad. But in a musical era & genre where the Beatles, Stones, Dylan and Hendrix were setting the pace, the Beach Boys and Pet Sounds were peripheral candy."
5,One of the greats.,"When I bought this album in 1966, I had just broken up with my current girlfriend the night before. I purchased it along with ""Big Hits, High Tides, and Green Grass"" by the Rolling Stones and ""If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears"" by the Mamas and Papas. Needless to say, when I played it first the other two were soon neglected. I had never heard anything like it before and now thirty-five years later, I still haven't. If you have never heard this, please do yourself a favor. You will never forget it or regret it!"
2,I Don't Get It!,"Why this is one of the greatest records in Pop Music history is beyond me. I have listened to this cd several times in both stereo and mono and I just don't get it. Each time I listen to it I have to struggle my way through. To me, it's just another Beach Boys record with Brian Wilsons' whiny vocals. That's not so bad when he's singing that corny surf music but when he tries to get serious as he does on Pet Sounds it's almost unbearable. How can anyone think that this is better than anything the Beatles did is even more ludicrous. Unless you're a serious Beach Boys fan or you just want to be tortured then buy this cd so you can be tortured in both stereo and mono for the price of one."
1,Masterpiece?,"I am very disapointed! After looking for this album for 10 years, at least I bought it and ... masterpiece?C'mon people! I have around 2000 Rock albums in my collection and I would never placed this not even between the top 100.How could anyone say that Rubber Soul or Revolver are under Pet Sounds? Any 60's Rolling Stone album is one hundred times better. And something else, if this is the sound that shape the American pop music, I might be wrong, but ... where is Jimi Hendrix, Muddy Waters, Miles Davis, etc? Those are really masters of American music, not The Beach Boys.I can't give to this album more than half star."
1,"More like the ""Mope Boys""","I love the Beach Boys as much as anyone. Let me say that again. I love the BEACH Boys as much as anyone. By that I mean I love the Beach Boys who actually live up to their name, singing about the beach, girls, surfing, cars, and Rhonda.This is not the Beach Boys. It can't be. Why? No beach songs! I thought it was some kind of joke. All ""Pet Sounds"" offers is the opportunity to hear Brian Wilson whine for forty minutes, backed by elevator music. There's barely any Mike Love on the album at all.Way overrated."
3,Nice beach music,"I find it hard to take anything from the US seriously,afterall its a cultural desert.The Beach Boys are typical examples of this cultural wasteland,empty & vapid with no soul.Remember we are talking about surfer boys here! Not your average birthplace of artistic genius! This album is just harmless party music and meant to be taken as seriously as a baywatch CD.I suggest the Mozarts of our time,the Beatles and their masterpiece Seargent Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band unless you just want a bunch of filler plus a few hits."
3,"Great Album, Not So Great Execution","Pet Sounds is one of my favorite albums, so the three stars I gave for this review is more of an indication of how I feel about this anniversary release.While this release will be great for those who never owned Pet Sounds, or only owned the standard CD, the DVD-Audio release of this album from a couple years ago had a much better surround sound mix. The dolby 5.1 mix on this anniversary disc is awful compared to the DVD-A. At the very least it should have been a DTS surround mix.But, for those who want a great album in unique packaging, then this is for you. But if you do have a DVD-Audio capable player, go for the DVD-A release instead."
3,"Important, yes, great, no.","Just because something is important doesn't make it great. Look at our current president, important, yes, great, not hardly. Yes this album is good and Brian Wilson deserves praise, but let's not go overboard. Springsteen, The Beatles, and others not only have one, but more than one album better than this. You Still Believe in Me, and Don't Talk sent me running for the phone to call the suicide hotline. These songs don't evoke much if any emotion and are droning. There are some very good songs on this album (Wouldn't if be Nice, Sloop John B, God Only Knows, and a couple others are good) but to be a great album, shouldn't most, if not all, of the songs be great? 2.5 stars."
3,Good,"This is a good album. Thus said, I don't see it deserving being on any top 10 or even top 50 list of greatest albums ever."
3,it's rated over Revolver?,"When the editors of Rolling Stone put out their magazine on the top 500 albums, I looked in it and saw that the only album in the history of rock music that beats this album is Sgt.Pepper,WHAT? I borrowed this album from someone and listened to it, and don't get me wrong it was very good, and no doubt ahead of it's time, but still number 2? Rolling Stone is not the only people who feel this way,in the liner notes it is praised by both Paul McCartney and George Martin, in the VH1 100 greatest albums it was rated number 3(Nevermind was 2 and Revolver was 1).But when I think about it maybe I feal this way because I was not around when it was put out, maybe I truly do not understand why people are saying it was so great. My true opinion is that it is a very good album and should be listened to and maybe even bought but don't trust the quality of this album by looking at Rolling Stone, listen to it and if you love it that much then buy it, but I still think it is very overrated."
1,Tired background music,"Come on, there's a reason why people werent buying this album in the 60s (it's the beach boys least successfull album todate) it just wasnt good. There are no great guitar solos like on good charlotte or Simple plan. All I hear is Brian Wilson whining about love for 50 minutes backed by background music you would feel embarrased to listen to. This isn't real talent, real musical talent is 50 cent, Jessica Simpson, Good Charlotte, that's real music. This? I dont know what it is."
5,IF GOD MADE MUSIC---THIS IS IT!!,If you can listen to this and not feel moved your obviously not a human being. If you can listen to this and not cry--youve obviously never been in love. If you can listen to this and notwonder about relationships--you obviously have no heart.To all those people out there who bash this album*beware the darkside of the force*
3,"""A"" for effort, ""F"" for relavance","I so much wanted to enjoy this piece and although its composition is of the highest conceivable quality and the performance herein absolutely first rate, I find the notions of ""agitprop"" tiresome at best, pendulous, heavy handed and well, irrelevant (in this case) at worst. Colossal disappointment. Post Fascist Europe, post Communism, this paean to the imminent International Workers' uprising (that never occurred) is hard for me as a Baby Boomer to take. As far to the left as I may be, it must still be admitted that Communism was irrevocably discredited not so many years ago after tens of millions of murders and incarcerations. And so, this brilliant composer's talents are just plain wasted in pursuit of proselytizing the world about a passé Umweltanschaung. Perhaps the wheel will turn making this work and its attendant aesthetic yet again relevant. Maybe his instrumental music next time..."
5,The best pet diarrhea medication,"My German Shepherd has colestridium, a chronic diarrhea condition caused by increased levels of bacteria in the intestines. It occasionaly flares up when he is stressed, or eats the wrong thing, like deer feces. Previously, my vet treated it with antibiotics, which were expensive, and took forever to kick in. This product is a lifesaver! It coats the intestines, and clears up the symptoms fast. It is a much more natural way to treat this condition. I even use it as a preventative, such as before a vet visit, or a long car ride. It literally keeps diarrhea from occurring. I have found that mixing his doses with cottage cheese, or pieces of cheese that he loves works much better than putting it on regular food or water that may not be finished. Plain yogurt or baby food is also a good idea to mix it with for pets that are picky eaters. Great product!"
1,Pet Pectillin,"Pet Pectillin is vanilla flavored and my two cats with severe diarrhea absolutelyrefused to take it. It may be useful for people with dogs,but I do not advisebuying it for cats!"
2,Very bland,"Tough-talking noir drama about LAPD detectives' ethical dilemma after heisting robber's loot. Fans of classic character studies should enjoy the abundant dialogue, but those seeking hard-boiled action should look elsewhere."
5,You either love it or hate it.,"You may notice the other reviews rate Two Lane Blacktop with either 5 stars or 0 stars. This can be attributed to weather or not the reviewer does or does not understand the fascination gearheads have with the automobile. There is no in-between. If you are looking for strong acting performances that inspire and move you, then keep looking elsewhere. If you are down with the era gone by, sadly, of musclecars and then men who are obsessed by them, this is your movie. You will see things you never will see today. Superbirds racing Hemi 'Cudas, Superbees racing Chargers, 442's and Chevelles getting it on. If you know what all this means, buy this movie. You will understand. You will not be sorry you did."
4,two lane blacktop,i bought this dvd for my boyfriend. we sat and watched it and was very satisfied with the condition the movie was in. there was no skips or scratches on it at all which is surprising for a used dvd..i would definitely order again
5,An Increadable insperasional movie,Two Lane Blacktop is one of those movies that just seems to leave you in awwww it is just great for ordinary movie watcher's I could see the story laging at times but you have to understand it to appreshiate it
2,"Ya gotta love James Taylor in anything,,,,But this movie",Lame is an understatement. Not even worth a Netflix rental. JT must have been at his peak of drug use. I don't have anything against drugs either! We likely got some great songs out of his wilder days. I love his music and I love anything with old cars in it but this IS bad. I couldn't finish it after two trys. I'd bet he's better actor today but there is no need. JT was born to sing. His voice is just a great now if not better than ever. Buy a record instead.
1,Too-Lame Blanktop,"This has got to be the MOST BORING movie ever made. Even allowing for the cool factor, nothing can account for the endless scenes of NOTHING HAPPENING.As for the fact that these two well-known and respected musicians' acting careers never went anywhere, it is certainly no surprise, since this movie and the characters they play go less than nowhere.What are they talking about? What are they doing and why are they here? Who frickin' cares. The usually reliable Warren Oates is wasted and the ""love interest"" is as exciting as a dead battery.Don't waste your time. Even the trailer couldn't find 30 seconds of excitement to string together."
1,Still Boring after all these years,"I originally saw this film in a theater in Fresno, CA in the early 70's. I thought it was boring then and still do now. It was my interest in Dennis Wilson that made me see the film and then buy the DVD. Slow, boring and will put you to sleep. You wonder why a movie like this ever came out. Dennis, James, Warren, and Laurie try their best but who approved the script and financing for this film?"
1,discarded tape,The first 12 minutes of this tape are unwatchable(?) because the tape is wrinkled. This was advertised as good used. This tape should have been discarded.Like everything else now adays. Ones opinion differs on good versus trash.
5,"Hypnotic, Bittersweet, Remarkable","I found this movie in my TiVo suggestions list a few months ago, and it has really gotten under my skin.As some of the other reviews have mentioned, the movie appears to be about fast cars, drag racing and cross-country travel, but it is realy about loneliness, alienation, and numbness.The four main characters (listed in the credits as ""The Driver"", ""The Mechanic"", ""The GTO"", and ""The Girl"") barely interact with each other (there is less than 20 lines of dialog in the first 45 minutes). When they win a race, the driver and the mechanic show no emotion; they seem to derive no pleasure from it.When the GTO shows up, the film gets more noisy, but the constant chattering that Warren Oates' character is spouting to every hitchhiker he picks up seems to be a desperate attempt to avoid silence, to avoid dealing with his own thoughts.The pace is slow, but the images are beautifully shot and the sound is clear."
2,dvd,"this disc would not play in the xbox, playstation, but only in the computer. oh well. that's what I get for choosing the cheapest option."
4,muscle cars,"highly recommend this '70s road movie, the cars are awesome and the acting is so about what I expected, well worth it"
4,Cool Movie for the 1970's,"I liked this movie and is along the lines of ""Vanishing Point"". I enjoyed seeing the good old days of cruising, racing, etc. Gasoline at .41 cents per gallon and the old American landscape was a hoot. The movie does move slow in some places but very well done for the 1970's. No green screen special effects, just plain filming on the fly. Quality of reproduction was very good...."
5,"Gas, Tires and Oil....","Excellent 1971 film reminiscent of Easy Rider or Vanishing Point with James Taylor as the stoic Driver and Dennis Wilson as the Mechanic....these two characters travel across the country in their '55 Chevy racing anyone who wants to for money--definitely a life going nowhere, which kinda explains the non-resolution ending....perhaps implying that it just never gets anywhere.... Cool scenery and places long gone are ever present as Warren Oates pilots his GTO eastward and onward, interacting with the Chevy as they race to D.C. for pink slips.... Techniscope, a poor man's Cinemascope, was the film of choice for this production....it is almost as grainy as 16mm, but looks good enough on this blu-ray.... The audio is mono or a narrow 5.1 mostly positioned up front, with the massive engines benefitting the most from it....cool supplements as well....you can never go fast enough...."
4,2-Lane Blacktop is more than a great gearhead flick,"First of all, the encounter at the gas station involves this question by an admiring attendant: ""Small block?"" Taylor's response: ""Big block"". Attendant: ""396""? Taylor's glorious response: ""454"". OH yeah.I especially like the part where the girl they pick up kisses Warren Oates goodbye. He looks at her and grins, as if to say [but he doesn't -- he only grins] ""Hey, I guess I must be pretty cool for you to kiss me like that"". After she pulls away to leave his car, she stops and looks at him -- a long, deep look. His grin fades, they share a moment of understanding, then she leaves. Her look said to him ""The kiss was for your pain, your loneliness -- I understand"". Heavy stuff -- very '60's. Ultimately she leaves Taylor as well, opting for a biker. She looks back to Taylor -- who remins in the diner they had stopped at. What is unsaid speaks volumes about her fear of closeness, and his struggle with the isolation he's chosen for himself."
3,classic road picture,"I was one of the many extras in two lane blacktop, so for me, it was a great piece of nostalgia. Ok, the acting left a lot to be desired, except for character actor Warren Oates. He was a hoot. But as far as the car flix genere goes, Two lane rates up there with the best. A must see for car buffs and hot rod fans"
1,Buddy Gonna Shut You Down,"I have to wonder whether other people giving this movie four and five stars actually watched it. A die-hard Beach Boys fan, I tried to watch it and cheer for the Mechanic-actor Dennis Wilson. Fell asleep more times than I could count. The acting stalls worse than a siezed engine that has been leaking oil. Yikes."
2,Two Lane Dead End,"I watched the movie after purchasing it for a freind who is a big James Taylor music fan. I was disapointed in the character writing, as J.T. (The Driver)and Dennis Wilson (The Mechanic) both play the ""straight"" role, and it causes the scenes to drag. Upon more in depth analysis, Wilson's character is supposed to be aloof, and J.T.'s intense. Unfortunately, bad acting and poor character developement defused this combination.Warren Oates does contribute to some of the best scenes in the film, as the mixed-up ""GTO"". A chameleon-like persona, ever-changing to adapt to and impress each hitch-hiker he picks up.The scene with Harry Dean Stanton is particularly amusing in its context.In all, ""Two Lane Blacktop"" was interesting, easy to watch, but the ending, if you can call it that (I find it hard to believe that the original theatrical ending is what I viewed on DVD) left me cold and wanting."
1,bad movie,I am very disappointed. I bought this tape for my boyfriend and I felt like a fool when he put it in the VCR and all you could see was fuzzy lines. First I paid extra for shipping and now I paid for a movie I can't even watch. I hope you will send me a movie that works and also a self stamped package so I can send this defected one back to you.
4,"Slow, But Captivating","I finally saw this last night after having heard so much about it. Yes, ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" is a slow-moving film, but its essence is very soothing. Perhaps it's the quiet of the open road or the quaintness of the small-town gas stations and diners. Or maybe it's that the simplicity of the protagonists' lives points to a simpler era.""Two-Lane Blacktop"" makes me think of Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road.""The acting of the two leads is stale, but their good looks make up for it. You could almost feel the Girl's wanderlust; her character is admirable for rejecting convention in search of a larger life. G.T.O. is obviously in need of pyschiatric help, but the hitchhikers he picks up are fascinating. (It's a bonus that Harry Dean Stanton is one of them.)See ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" if you just want to peacefully zone out for a couple of hours."
3,"Easy Rider, but with cars","The existential angst that ""Easy Rider"" made so simple is presented here with tedium and lotsa stuff that simply wasn't very interesting. If it weren't for the performance of Warren Oates, it would've been a bust, at least for me. I applaud James Taylor and Dennis Wilson for the effort; they were actually OK, but there's no excuse for the over-wrought, annoying performance of Laurie Bird, as the only major female cast member. Why Taylor or Wilson would even give a ** about her made this film annoying, maybe only for me. Sorry I don't like as much as others; I very much like and respect Independent film."
5,VERY VERY COOL,"I hadn't seen this film in such along time that I forgot what a gem it is. Such a departure from what you might expect considering the stars of the film. A must see for anyone into cars, music, the west, and road trips. And and intersting fact about the film - A.J. Solari, who plays the ""Tennessee Hitchiker"" (I believe the 3rd hitchiker Oates picks up)is the brother-in-law to legendary Los Angeles and New York disc jockey B. Mitchell Reed."
3,Artistically lacking but still a good car flick.,"I saw this movie when it was first released to the theaters and 2 or 3 times on tv since. The acting by Oates was typical of him. It seems that he played the same type character in all his movies. Taylor and Wilson just plain didn't act, no personality or character to relate to. There was a very thin plot. For people that love cars like I do, enjoy this film. The competition between the old hot rod and the sleek new factory built hi-performance car makes this an intriging movie."
3,A Look at history,"Although this book bought home a lot of histroy, I really thought it would have been more in depth. I was looking for more pictures and perhaps interviews. If there is a publication that is offering this, I would want to hear about it."
4,Just what I expected,"It's exactly what I expected when I ordered it. It's only plastic, but it looks great on our wall. My husband loves the Packers and he was so excited when he opened it."
5,Read this and prosper,"This book covers business basics that haven't changed in a thousand years. It presents the concepts simply, with planty of analogies and examples. Don't look for details, but if you follow these guidelines, you'll run a good business. I had my senior staff read this and we reviewed it chapter by chapter."
5,First rate textbook and resource for practicing engineers,"This is an excellent text and sourcebook for practicing engineers. While not a handbook, this book contains a lot of useful data, however, its primary value is as text that gives general guidance and explains why the alloys behave as they do. The authors of this book are world leaders in the subject matter, and as expected, they have produced a first-rate book. The book begins with three chapters, which concisely describe the metallurgy of stainless steels, followed by five chapters that discus the welding of the different types of stainless steels (i.e., Austenitic, Ferritic, Martensitic, Duplex and Precipitation Hardened stainless steels). The final two chapters discuss the welding of dissimilar steels and weldability testing."
5,Great intro book with lovely tunes,"Robin Williamson's Penny Whistle book has been around for a long time and it's a wonderful book for beginners and beyond. There are some stunningly beautiful, yet simple tunes in it and he does a wonderful job communicating in words how to develop a good sound and how to read music."
5,budget speech,nick drake and fives leaves left a classic folk album that is no means depressing as others have stated it's a visonary album of beautiful strummed guitar with a voice of an angel over the top with simple lyrics too not over-stretch our tiny mindsa beauty of an album a great artist who died too young well i suppose these things happen for a reason
4,Well intentions,"It seems to me that Nick Drake had a a perfect thought. And that thought tried to leak out in his music. It leaked in a beautiful manner. Although this is a wonderfully made album. Some tracks do become a bit too much, repetative, or odd in some eays. The introduction; Time Has Told Me, is perfect. Then thre are several songs such as River Man, Three Hours, and Way to blue, and those are a bit odd, and have too much Bongo. Day is Done is the true Masterpiece of this album, and Saturday Sun is the true icing on the cake. I love the Cello, and it is approached in such a beautiful manner. Way to go."
2,More like two leaves left,"In my opinion, the CD contains two songs that I thought were worth listening to; the rest just sounded like filler music. I should have purchased the singles instead."
5,timeless flight,"a record of a very clear moment, but not at all tied to the time it was recorded.... file next to 'forever changes' and 'astral weeks,' naturally..... for fans of yorke, j. buckley, sheik and binocular.... for sure..."
3,Beautifully Disturbing,"I've tried Five Leaves Left several times: at the office, in the car, on my home stereo, and with headphones; frankly, I don't understand what all the hubbub is about. The album rates near the top on everyone's Top-100 list, and I had hoped that I would be enthralled by the ""unnoticed master."" I have no argument with the fact that his work is melodic (The Thoughts of Mary Jane) and lush (Way of Blue, Day Is Done). I'm simply not enthusiastic concerning his voice and subject matter. Drake reminds me of Britain's answer to Bob Dylan - Donovan. His delivery is effeminate and breathy. Compared to the Zombies' Colin Blunstone, I believe Drake's voice falls short in energy, range and beauty. Lyrically, Five Leaves Left is lonely, disparate, melancholy, and generally depressing. I keep my copy handy for rainy afternoons. In small doses, I find Five Leaves Left beautifully disturbing. Perhaps a greater appreciation of Drake will take more time."
5,One of the bests records of all-time,"It's impossible to me, an educated 29 years-old south american man, describe the fellings that been brought to me by Five Leaves Left. As all Nick Drake's records we got here sadness, shyness, fragility and above it all, beauty. But it's a new kind of beauty, which come from soul, and it's not just coming from Drake's soul. This music makes our souls more beautifull than before and I can't explain it with simple words. Songs like River Man are modern opus of the century, with the strings floating over the ground, made by Drake's voice and guitar, leading us to a state of grace and compassion. I know it seems corny, but it's true. Buy this cd now and be prepared to see the world by another perpective."
4,Don't miss him this time around,"As someone whose musical sensibilities were shaped in the 60's, I'm ashamed to say I didn't discover Nick Drake 'till 2000. Someone suggested I listen, and I bought 3 CDs within the week.Listening to his music feels like I missed an artist whose music was as essential to his times as Joni Mitchell or Van Morrison. It feels impossible that his music escaped me at the time. If you've never heard him, take a listen. You won't regret it."
1,TGreat CD!!!,"I heard all these bad reviews from the other reviewers and I wasn't sure I should buy this, but my friend convinced me I should. I'm not sure why everyone hates this book. I mean, it is kind of dumb, but it's OK."
2,Moribund,"Nick Drake was a minor talent when alive, and death hasn't changed that one iota. He sings in a Donovan-like moribund drone, the arrangements are lacklustre, and most significantly, there's a definite lack of emotional connection between the music and the listener. His music is strictly ""emperor's new clothes;"" people want to see something there, when there's little to nothing."
2,"tired, aloof and coy","I know this guy is supposed to be some kind of saint, but this CD left me cold. If Drake can't be bothered to show a little emotion on this, he shouldn't have bothered to record it."
5,Perfection!,"As I was reading some reviews from Tindersticks' ""Curtains"", the name of Nick Drake appeared before my eyes for the first time. And, for the first time ever, I listened Nick's voice in the now-classic song ""Pink Moon"" and I fell desperately in love for his music. In reviewing ""Five Leaves Left"", which I consider to be the best album ever, I just wanted to express my gratitude to Nick Drake for making some of my days more beautiful."
5,Why have I not known about this guy??,"I am the owner of over a 1000 CD's and have spent a lot of time collecting 60's 70's rock and folk. Just a couple of months ago my brother-in-law sends me Nick Drake for my birthday. I went nuts. His voice and lyrics remind me of Leonard Cohen, his music has a very clean sound, and his guitarist is fantastic. Going to my books I found out this guys interesting history which especially includes his real performance anxiety and the lack of FM radio in Britain during his era. All they played was pop at the time thus neglecting a real master. If you like the fusion of folk, acoustic rock, and classical elements with clear tight vocal arrangements then you cant lose with this one."
4,"Encircling, a little bit in circles.","This album from my absolute most favorite Christian Band was a little bitof a dissapointment. It seems nothing in my mind can top their ""Journey IntoThe Morn"", their fourth release. I love this band and will buy anything theyrelease. Giving them 4 stars is not a put down but just compares them withprevious albums. My only criticism, is sameness. But we do want the stylerepeated which caused us to embrace them initially, right! Again I was a littledisappointed after such a long lay off. I thought there latest would shake theworld, at least my world. But it is a great album, and I would recommend a buy,and while you're at it. Buy all their releases. Steve Ward"
4,A SINGER WITH A DEEP SOFT VOICE REMINISCENT OF ENRIQUE,MOST OF THE SONGS ARE SLOW BALLADS WITH A SOFT- ROCK UNDERBEAT. HIS SOFT SILKY VOICE MAKES YOU WANT TO MAKE SPANISH YOUR FIRST LANGUAGE. I RECIEVED THIS CD AS A GIFT AND I REALL ENJOY IT. IT REMINDS ME A LOT OF ENRIGUE IGLESIAS. WORTH THE MONEY.
5,I saw the movie the Peaceful Warrior and it changed my life! So........,"I had sent my copy of my older book to a friend so I thought I would like to have thiis one and it is awesome as promised. For anyone needing inspiration to live in the NOW and to learn to stop THINKING and just BE or DO, this is the book to read. It is often difficult to QUIET THE MIND LONG ENOUGH TO listen to your heart, intuition and soul. I highly recommend it. Second Wind Creations on facebook."
3,Not that good.,"Just a story, not much enlightenment in my opinion. Not as good when compared to others accounts of Millman's ""journey""!"
5,awesome,"this book is an enlightening artefact for me! ..and believe me it can be for millions others too! it gives a unique approach to the ""serving others"" attitude ..it's just a life's aim for me! it's a journey actually.. as the peaceful warrior's journey"
4,Inspiring....well worth the read.,"This book is a follow up to Millmans' first book, ""Way of the Peaceful Warrior"", which should be read previous to this book. Although I found Peaceful Warrior more inspiring, I still really enjoyed this book and gained some inspiration from it. This book deals alot with compassion and love and would recommend it to anyone who is interested or beginning in buddhism. The book is very fictional and metaphoric but the messages are clear and real. I think that it is a great book for anyone young and old and would recommend it as such"
1,"Love Millman, hated this book.","I have been a Dan Millman for over 20 years. I own almost all of his books, but this was by far the worst. If I had read this one 1st I never would have picked up another book by him.This book goes too far into the ""mystic"" and ""new age"" side of his teachings. It was too far fetched for me. Minor details did not fit with what was written in ""The Way of the Peaceful Warrior."" One MAJOR thing was that ""Joseph"" comes back from the dead to make an appearance in this story. Not a vision - Joseph is alive and well and raising a family.Everything else I have read by Dan, has inspired me to make changes in my life and try to improve, not so with this story.It does have some insightful thoughts, but they are few and far between.Finishing it was drudgery. Do yourself a favor, choose another title and let Dan inspire you."
4,Decent Sequel To Peaceful Warrior,"I loved the ""Peaceful Warrior"" book and, to be honest, I didn't expect much from this ""sequel"". However, after reading it I was pleasently suprised. True, it is not as enjoyable as the Peaceful Warrior, but I liked it and it added some ""lessons"" to be learned.It's too bad Millman stopped writing semi-fictional stories and now just produces ""How to be Happy"" type of books. I really enjoyed his stories! For those who also like the fun and excitement of learning through a story you may want to check out the book ""The Evolution of a Warrior"" <Regan>."
3,Some good messages,"I have read a handful of Dan Millman books. The Way of the Peaceful Warrior I believe will forever be my favorite book period. I read an article where Millman was saying how initially this book was going to be a 50 page book, not a novel, of methods towards being a peaceful warrior. It is funny because after I read the book and before I read the article my thought was, ""He should have just made a 50 page book of these teachings."" To me personally, the story is not that strong. It is worth reading simply for a lot of the teachings, 50 pages worth. The rest is 150 pages or so of a story I personally did not find much value. But, Journey's and The Way are his two strongest books. Both of which are excellent."
2,Elemental,"This book may be OK for people with little or no background in spiritual awareness.The author has been ""inspired"" - to put it mildly- by Castaneda's work.He is nowhere even close to attaining Castaneda's depth or artistic talent.There is no new concept, no original idea that I can remember : every single inspiration can be tracked down to previous authors .The overall design , i.e. a man who finds a spiritual teacher almost as if by chance is a direct copy of Don Juan. Situations, characters and dialogues are infantile ; it is definitely an effort to put forth some spiritual ideas through an adventure story ( absolutely unbelievable) to appeal to a wider public.If you buy your books at the Newstands stores of airports, this may be right for you : easy reading and sugary.If you have a serious interest in the field, be sure to leave it on the stand."
4,The Sacred Warrior review ~,"I am currently enjoying the Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior. Although I have not ended the book, it is uplifting and fun reading for early mornings in the hot tub!!! It is somewhat spiritually uplifting and I appreciate that very much. I have other projects in the middle that is why the reading is going a little more slowly but in this way I can enjoy it a little more as well. Thank you for this review."
1,Great dissertation,"The title suggest a very interesting and worthy subject. However, the book seems to be a copy of Ikegami's dissertation. Factual information does not have to be communicated with words that cannot be understood by most readers. I spent most of my time in Google - researching definitions. It appears this book is a regeneration of the writer's dissertation."
5,Best. Pencil. Period.,"If you are saying to yourself ""is one pencil any better than another?"" then the answer is simply YES! The pencil writes extremely smooth, just as smooth as a Ticonderoga (at least). It's much more durable then a Ticonderoga, too. A Pink Pearl eraser is simply one of the best erasers available, and I'm glad to see that somebody finaly decided to incorperate one into a regular pencil eraser. The pencil also looks really nice (like anyone cares) and the paint doesn't chip easily. Finaly, and most importantly for some people, don't forget that these babies are wicked CHEAP. Well-crafted, but cheap in terms of price. At just over two bucks, these are worth every cent.~PEACE OUT~"
2,"Too much fluff, not enough stuff","I agree with pretty much all the negative reviews. There's too much history of the fitness industry, too much about the author's spinning obsession and what she did in college, not enough information about ""ultimate fitness."" Bottom line: this is not a book for the athlete or anyone wishing to improve their fitness routine. There are some nuggets of wisdom, but they're hard to find; the author puts them in almost as an afterthought and does not build on them at all. I'd give this one a miss."
1,Reporter turns a good article into tedious book,"This book contains about 25 pages of interesting information, most of which you have probably heard before, about how various forms of exercise can reduce weight and improve health, fitness and mood. The other 90% of the book is a pointless and boring melange of personal recollections and anecdotes about people you have never heard of and would never care to meet. The author's ""spinning"" fetish is especially wearisome. Unfortunately the 25 pages of interesting information is scattered throughout this tedious tome, so the rate of information transfer is about 10% of what one would reasonably expect from a good nonfiction book. The author is a journalist and should stick to writing articles that can be purged of their fluff by a good editor."
3,"Basic info & history - but no revelations - why ""ultimate""?","This is a good history of exercise in the United States and discussion of basic information on fitness. The author has investigated the more commonly held myths about fitness and written out her findings clearly. However, I was disappointed that there is much more history (at least 2/3 of the book) than real news about exercise. Most of the myths explored in this book have been ""debunked"" by others before; the knowledge is not new if you've done any ready about fitness at all since 1990. (The only thing new I learned, in fact, is that studies have proven that different people's bodies respond differently to exercise - and that approximately 1% do not respond AT ALL. Yikes!) Overall, this is a good book, just not as ""ultimate"" as I was led to expect."
3,Refreshingly honest,"Despite the somewhat rambling nature of Kolata's style, I found myself unable to stop reading this book. If you're looking for a book to tell you exactly what to do to get a slim, healthy body, this is not it. It focuses much more about what is not true about exercise than what is true - but in some ways that is just as helpful. I never realized how much we don't know about the benefits of exercise. The main virtue of the book is that it makes no bones about saying that getting that body will take a lot of hard work and effort, but that the process and the satisfaction of success will be worth it. Despite all the bad news, it's inspiring!"
1,Not as title would indicate,"I would simply like to confirm/reiterate what other negative reviews have said about this book, Ultimate Fitness. It is not a book about either the science or history of exercise, but is rather an extended reflection on the author's obsession with spinning, which is a form of highly stylized but intense stationary biking. It is well-written, but I wouldn't have bothered reading it if I had understood what it was."
3,I'm in love with the cover,"This book is an interesting reflection of it's author, but disappoints. Perhaps the cover promised too much. The author and her husband are addicted to ""spinning"" which, I surmise, is the exercise du jour of the New York gliteratti. The book purports to outline the structure and history of the fitness business. Indeed, there are interesting thumbnails of characters ranging from Bernarr MacFadden through Joe Weider (Arnold's mentor). However, major influences like Paul Bragg (who inspired Jack LaLanne and others) are not mentioned. There are summaries of a variety of academic studies (reps vs. weights, etc.) but the usefulness of the information is swamped by the self-indulgent effusions about spinning and particularly the author's joy in doing it. Not a bad book, but hard to recommend."
1,horrible book,"loaded with useless information. Pay attention to Harriet Klausner's reviews all of them are 5 star reviews, I believe Harriet Klausner is paid to write perfect reveiews as none of her reviews are ever under 5 stars which is very suspciousdon't give any of her reviews any credit cause she's full of bsDropb0mbs"
1,Terrible book,"This is a terrible book. It doesn't warrant me saying more than that. If you buy it or even waste your time reading it, you deserve what you get."
2,stick to reporting,some of the statements from the book are just not accurate. For example stating that putting on 4 pounds of muscle will not add weight. That four pounds that will not have a positive effect on a persons overall metabolism is simply not true. Muscle is your metabolism and the bodies fat burning machine.
1,Tiresome and repetitive- why did she write this book?,"I still can't find the answer to that question. This book began with no voice to lead one through it's sprawling travels of unlinking timelines and ended with no point in hand. I have no time to begin with but then to waste ones time on a book like this makes me crazy. There is not one remarkable, enlightening statement made in this book, everything in it is a no-brainer, don't waste your time like I did."
3,Good but...,"I found this book very interesting, but was disturbed by the historical work she did looking at fitness -- as if the only people involved in fitness/exercise as a way of maintaining health were white Europeans. Here we go again. Nothing about the incredible traditions in other parts of the world. This made me not really trust how accurate the rest of the book was, but I still found it interesting -- if heavily culturally bound."
2,Not What I Expected,"If you really want the ""truth about exercise and health"", just read the Epilogue. The rest of the book is filled with far too much detail about the history of the fitness movement and business, including the author's own experiences. In fact, one comes away with the conclusion that this woman is somewhat obsessed with exercise. What reader can relate to a person who admits that she belongs to three different gyms, two in New York and one in New Jersey? In a word, the book was boring. I only continued reading it because I kept thinking it was going to get better in terms of answering the big question, i.e., ""what is the truth about exercise and health?"" Little did I know that I only needed to read the last chapter to find out."
3,Starts off great but then dies....,"I agree with many of the reviews here. This book starts off great reviewing and explaining fitness ""truths"", but then dies when she spends about a 1/3rd of the book going into great detail about her Spinning experience. I was interested in learning about the science that backs up - or doesn't back up - the exercise information that is pushed every day by trainers, magazines and sales people. This book only touched on that and then when into a slow Spinning death...."
2,This is NOT a fitness book,"After reading halfway through this book, I decided to stop reading any further. This is not really a fitness book geared for people trying to get into shape.After seeing Gina Kolata on a TV talk show, I expected a lot of useful information on fitness myths. Instead, the book consists of 5% fitness information and the other 95% percent are boring anecdotes about her personal life and fitness gurus, trainers, and doctors that I doubt anyone would care to learn more about.Read this book if you literally want to learn the ""history"" of various fitness myths (in all it's arcane detail). For me, I just want the bottom line information."
3,who in the world is Harriet Klausner???,"She's written over 5,000 reviews for Amazon, and from scanning her About You page it seems that at least 70% of them are 5 stars, and at least 20% are 4 stars. A Google search confirmed this pattern on a number of other reviewers' sites.Which suggests:1. Mrs. Klausner is ridiculously easy to please: she has very low standards and loves everything she reads/sees,2. Mrs. Klausner has amazing psychic abilities: she only reads/sees things that she accurately anticipates liking,or3. Mrs. Klausner is a clever businesswoman: she gets paid to like just about everything she reads/sees."
2,"Pleasant read, but doesn't deliver","I found her style to be very enjoyable to read, but the book lacks substance. Some interesting history of fitness. She shoots down some excercise myths, but then doesn't provide much in the way of answers. Seems like an extended magazine article.This is certainly NOT a how-to guide for fitness, especially ULTIMATE fitness!"
1,"Misleading Title - Non Scientific ""Story'","Not worth 1 cent. Virtually zero science, and the rest reads like a diary review of narcissistic self-thought. You will learn nothing of exercise, physiology or anything else that might be useful for personal exercise or training. A womans story with all the interest of discussing shopping."
4,Interesting Read Indeed!,I am a sports medicine doctor and I found this book very insightful and full of all sorts of pearls that I can pass onto my patients. I particularly enjoyed the way the author used her own personal experiences to find out what is real and what is bunk in the world of exercise. Kuddos Gina!
2,Grill Cleaner Envy,Did not care for this product. Very hard to use and not very effective. You would be better off with a copper brush for your stainless steel grates. I would not recommend this product.
4,Great sound,"These Meinl wood claves are great. They have a really good and traditional sound that is very resonant. I was pleasantly surprised by the resonance and the range of sounds you can get with these. You may be able to find cheaper, but these are definitely the best choice. An excellent way to add to your music!On a side note, you may want to look elsewhere if you are looking for non-traditional claves or a really high or low pitch/timbre."
3,Not the best sound,"I got these for my daughter to play along with her dad, but the sound is much shallower than I'm used to. Good price though."
2,Taking a weak stab at Blair Witch...,"The film takes a stab at capturing some of the realism of the original Blair Witch project and reality TV. The story itself is entertaining and could easily be used again to greater effect. However, this movie only gets 2 stars for a number of reasons.1. There is little to no action in the first hour of the film. It is just people talking about little to nothing, with no special effects, and a minuscule amount of action. It's nearly painful to watch.2. The biggest point of realism in this film is when the two filmmakers discuss wanting to do more but not having any budget for special effects or doing what they want. I felt that was probably VERY real.The last fifteen minutes are faster paced with more effects and wrap the film up nicely. Overall, this is a nice movie to relax with if you're ready for the first hour to be dull. Asylum had made better movies and I look forward to seeing them evolve."
1,"Enough Asylum, we've had it with your bad movies.",Haunted house is another Asylum production. This movie is nothing more than a glorified home video (and not a good one). I have seen better movies on cable-access. There is nothing to recommend about this movie. They should show this movie to the prisoners at GITMO. It'll have them confessing to anything. A little more than a hour long. An hour I'll never get back..Don't watch it!!!!
1,"Walk away, Far away!!","Okay, so I saw the cover for this movie at the video store and desided, why not. I'm all about the horror flix. I sat thur the hour and 14 min movie. And I now wish I hadn't. It was by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Even worst than Kazzam. For real. If you love yourself or the people your with. Please don't watch this movie."
2,a haunted house story you could make yourself..,"it's not that this movie was bad,it just it wasn't any good.like eating taco bell in Mexico..acting was not bad,it just wasn't acting,the story wasn't bad,just no story..the filming was bad(yes they did film this umm..story)..it was filmed in 16 mm..or something kind of flat..you do get to see some boobs..for about 10sec..one actor said he wasn't an actor...and he was right...so this movie would be great at a party were no one was watching..or a great cure for insomnia,just to let you know..i did watch it twice..i wanted to like it..but honestly..write me,and you can buy my copy..better still find a better movie.."
4,My Favorite Talking Head&#65533;s CD.,Good CD. Brings back memories of my college years in the 80's. The Talking Heads are a very unique band whose style compares with no other band.
2,It really pisses me off when a band raises my expectations and then disappoints me,"I've heard some bad rap about this album from those who hold true to Talking Heads classics, and what can I say, they were absolutely right. And She Was is easily the best on here, and Road To Nowhere is also very good, but the remainder is pure uninspiring rubbish that won't be memorable. Go with '77, More Songs About Buildings and Food, Remain In Light, and even Speaking In Tongues was better than this, and that to me is probably the last album you need to get. I've heard samples of Naked, and I won't even bother listening to the whole album, since that's even worse. This seems to be more representative of David Byrne's solo work, which tells me he wasn't listening to the advice of his bandmates, which might have been what expedited their breakup shortly afterwards."
3,Some Creativity But Limited In Substance,"Probably teh best qualities about this recording are thespecial arrangements and some oddball David Byrne lyrics. The lead tracks And She Was, Road To Nowhere, and Stay Up Late are the strengths of the disc most notably the middle tracks ocapella opening. Walk It Down as an interesting bass line and Creatures Of Love is kind of spunky and doesn't take up too much listening time. The rest of the songs do not offend me but in the same respect do not have much memorable about them either. The instrumental backing and vocals are creative, a bit unusual but not all that good with a few exceptions as noted above. Truthfully Elvis Costello, The Pretenders, Joe Jackson, and a few other new wave artists seem to have more talent going for them than this act. But these guys(and girl) are not bad. They have their niche and big fans of them will like this record. However, outsiders to this style could pass on this batch very easily."
4,"""Little Creatures"": Memorable, great pop from 'Heads.","I actually came across this album a couple years ago, but at the time I only really payed attention to the big hit, ""And She Was."" Then I checked it out again, and realized that each of these songs is catchy and solid. Sure, it's not as quirky or goofy as moments in older releases, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have greatness. It does. The album especially has a good album-ending punch with ""Television Man"" and ""Road to Nowhere."" ""Road"" was actually pretty unconventional compared to the remainder of the album even though it was one of the hits from the album. And yes, David Byrne sings more mid-range here. He actually does sound British at points, like in the chorus of ""Creatures of Love."" Quirky lyrics like ""I've seen sex and I think it's okay"" and ""I wanna make him stay up all night"" make the album memorable. It may not be an elitist favorite but it still connects to younger people, including me, a fan who isn't even 20 yet."
4,This is one of the best Talking Heads albums,"This was a gift for someone's birthday who had mentioned over the past year or two she had been meaning to buy this CD. She owned the vinyl album of this years ago, but now only has those memories of this excellent CD. Getting this for her is something I do not mind at all as I also like this album. Songs like 'She was' and 'Up all Night' are some of the tunes that come to mind and are timeless and just as fresh sounding now as they were 'all those years' ago. If you were a Talking Heads fan you will sure want to have this in your collection, if not a fan yet, just give this a listen and you will buy it. Every home needs an album this upbeat, fun,l and just dang good! Enjoy!"
4,It's getting to be pop music . . .,"This is an interesting recording. The TH's had really moved beyond their edgy-ness, but still had a knack for writing cool songs such as ""And She Was"" & ""Stay Up Late"" in particular. In this, they're moving toward the mainstream. Some of these songs are a bit of a drag, but overall it rocks."
5,Excellent Buy,This was an excellent buy and the customers service person I called was quite warm and accomodating.Courtney Whyte
5,The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: to Be or Not to Be,"Kennan Ward's book contains stunning photographs of the land, plants, and animals of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Mr. Ward writes from his personal experiences as a photographer and naturalist. Kennan published this book to help keep this pristine wilderness area a place of incredible beauty and wildlife diversity. His book makes a strong visual argument for the case of preserving this wildlife area from oil drilling. He does this by showing photographs of the significant environmental impact of oil companies in Alaska. I hope this book will not be a reminder of what the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was like, but instead, what it will continue to be for future generations of people and wildlife that come to this ""last wilderness."" I would highly recommend this book to any person who would like to learn more about the wildlife and environmental issues pertaining to the Refuge."
4,A wonderful project - Thank you to the Wards!,What a beautiful celebration of an area under threat. Thank you to the Wards for their focus and drive. We hope to see more work from these talented artists.
1,AD IS INCORRECT,"I bought two of these wrenches as I needed them for a specific job that required 1/8"" pins as stated in the ad copy. They arrived and the pins are 4mm. This is closer to 5/32."
2,A for effort,"The authors have put in much time and effort but I seem to have missed the point with this book. As a long time Oz and Garland fan, I don't know quite what to make of the whole thing. As a cookbook the recipes are old and dull, with most loaded with sugar and fat, (as are the celebrities who contributed their thoughts!) There isn't a single photo I have not seen before and the Oz related information is simply rehashed facts from previous Oz books. Even with the plethora of info available on Ozthese days, these authors have managed to get a few facts wrong. A nice thought. If you're an Oz fan, get it, you can never have enough books on Oz. If you're a cook or a baker, don't."
5,Cooking with Oz: Kitchen Wizardry,I bought this book to add to my Wizard of Oz collection.Very interesting movie and cook book.Very nice!
5,"We're off to see the Wizard, the one that cooks that is!","Who doesn't love the Wizard of Oz... and who wouldn't adore a cookbook in its honor!! This is such a treat. Lots of simple, fun and crazy tasty recipes will be found in this gem of a cookbook. PERFECT for when your child is into Oz and wants an Oz-themed birthday party! There's even a Toto inspired treat for your doggie too!Lots of behind the scene info, pictures, history of the cast and favorite cast recipes. Enjoy!"
5,quick reference,Very informative book on what you have not seen or done in the O.R.! Quick reference to help you prepare for your case! This book is worth getting!
4,pocet guide to the operating room,"I received the book in a timely manner, it's very useful, im currently in school for OR Surgical Tech and that is why i purchased the book, its very detailed informative book. it explains and alot, but only wish pictures were involved.thank you"
5,GREAT REVIEW FOR NEW RN IN THE OR,"I'm a new grad strating out in the OR and this book is a great review, esp. if you want to brush up on a procedure before the case starts."
5,Best gets even better! New 3rd Edition,"Back in October 2007 I wrote: As a senior nursing student doing my practicum in the OR, this little book offers the best concise information on specific procedures. Great for preparing the night before or in 2 minutes before a procedure. We have a voluminous Medcom series available in our suite, but I haven't touched it since getting Goldman's gem. Our OR nurse educator has taken a look at my copy and is considering recommending it for her new hires. If your need is not immediate, be aware that a new edition will be out in December 2007.January, 2008-Well the NEW EDITION is here and it's twice as many pages (1200), up-to-date (2007 vs. 1996), 100 new procedures and covers all the newest techniques and technology. As I now start my OR internship as a greduate nurse I look forward to using this new and even better edition of the best portable nursing reference for the OR! It's a bargain for the info it contains!"
4,No pictures!,This is a very compact guide packed with detail but has no photos or illustrations. The print is a small font they used in an effort to squeeze in as much info as possible. It is useful for surgical techs 7 operating room personnel as far as putting together surgical instrument trays/packs.
4,Great book,It is a great book with a lot of useful imformation that can help you while in the operating room learning the different types of procedures.
2,disappointed,"I got a new job in the OR and was excited to see that this book came in Kindle Format, which meant of course that I could have it immediately. What I've found is that Kindle version is not very useful. Difficult to read. In some cases the print is so small it is unreadable even on largest Kindle print size. Normal written addition is probably better. I'll never know. I feel like I wasted 40 dollars on Kindle addition."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Worthless. That's what I'd call this toy. The problem with this toy is that the child needs to be able to color match in order to use it. And if your child can color match, he/she is probably a little too old for this toy."
5,Played with Daily,"I got this for my son(12m) as well as one of my friend's son (11m). Both of them love it. My son still plays with it daily, granted it may not be how it was intended to be played with. Have had no problem with the balls going in. My son just smashes them in with his hands. It's also taught him to put things in cups, buckets, etc, so in away soon he'll be picking up all his toys :)"
1,Impossible for kids under 5,"My mom bought this for Easter for my daughter who was 6 months at the time. I didn't expect her to be able to hit the balls, but when my nieces who are 7 & 9 years old tried to hit the balls through the holes- it took a lot of strength. I don't understand why they would make a baby toy so hard for a baby to use. It's a great concept I would suggest another toy like this from another company."
4,Hard to say,"Until my toddler plays with this I cannot really give a good review. It looks okay in the package, though."
4,Fun toy,"My son enjoyed this toy, but he loves to bang on pretty much anything! He is 2 and his younger brother is 8 mo., so I have to supervise very closely to protect baby brother. It's also hard to keep up with the balls when he starts pounding away at this toy."
4,"Good toy, but watch carefully.","We bought this toy for our nine-month-old who likes to beat on things. For that it's super. She does have to hit the balls pretty hard to get them to go through the holes and she isn't so much interested in that yet, but she'll grow into it. I would say to be careful, however, because she has gotten her hand stuck in the hole trying to pull a ball out. She started to whimper and I looked down at her to find that she had shoved her hand into the the hole to pull out a ball and, because she wouldn't let go of the ball, she couldn't get her hand out. The thing is like a raccoon trap! Other than that, however, it's quite good. I love that it's entirely kid-powered with no batteries or obnoxious noises."
3,Just okay,My son got this for his first birthday. He doesn't use the hammer but likes to push the balls through and bang them together. For the price you can't expect much. The plastic seems brittle and it's not as well made as other name brand children's toys.
1,Intermittent Operation - Disappointed,"The Heart Rate Monitor worked okay for about two months then became unreliable. The heart rate goes in and out of lock. Wetting the chest band helped in the beginning. The watch display started to fade after about one year. I was so disgusted with the reliability I decided to try replacing the watch battery myself....don't try it. I disposed of the watch/waste band in the trash.......no loss. The watch/chest band must be retured to a dealer for battery replacement. After reading HRM reviews I decided to buy the Timex Heart Rate Monitor at Costco for $39 (user replaceable batteries). All I need is a HRM that will show I have reached my target HR, I do not need all the bells and whistles, it's on the workout equipment."
2,Battery dead after 6 weeks.,"I have used this watch for approx. 1 month and loved it, but just recently it just froze up on me. Couldn't get it out of the mode it was in, which was in the middle of a exercise session. I took it to a watch repair and they took out the battery and told me it was a little on the weak side. Put it back and now the watch is totally dead. Barely lasted 6 weeks."
3,"Nice, but watch size is too large for women","I bought this watch several months ago, and used it a couple times. It was a little loaded with features, which made it confusing for the basic exerciser to scroll through the HR, Calories, and Exercise Time menus. The thing I liked least about it was its huge size. It looked like a man's watch on my arm, and since I wanted to wear it daily as a watch, it was not very attractive. I did end up returning it to the store and purchasing another Polar model that was more basic and easier to operate. Polar makes a very good product, but having to send them away when the battery dies is not acceptable. I just end up buying a new one. Polar's bands have a problem with discoloration from wear, and by the time the battery dies, the watch is a little beaten up from daily wear, so paying for extensive reconditioning (like $60) is usually not worth it when you can buy a new one for $80."
1,Complete Piece of Garbage!!!,"Worthless. Half the time it doesn't work -- picks up other monitors, or doubles your heart rate, or doesn't show one, or shows a ridiculously low one. Nice, when it works, but completely unreliable. Don't waste your money."
5,reliable,"I never thought a device like this would motivate me to train even harder (and smarter), but it did. Informative display, and the record keeping function which tracks previous workouts, calories burned, etc. is nice feature for comparing and tracking your progress."
4,Excellent Product - Even if you're sasquatch!,"I have been very, very pleased with this product so far, after having been using it 3-4 times a week since December '08 and 5-6 times a week since March '09. It has performed extremely well even with my (sorry to say) very hairy chest.If I could have given it 4.5 stars I would have, but the fact that you have to send it away to get the battery changed is sort of hassle. Overall, though, I highly recommend this. Very, very happy with it."
2,Excellent product. Spotty Customer Service,"UPDATE: I lost the watch/receiver of my third Polar F6 and have decided to go with the Timex Race Trainer, instead of the Polar. Bought my first Polar F6 in 2006. It was reliable and produced accurate, consistent readings - but quality has gone downhill since then.I've had my Polar F6 for two years. It's a great product, but the company's customer service could be improved. Recently, I sent the unit to the Polar Dallas, TX service center and requested a new LCD and a new elastic transmitter strap. They returned it with a new battery and new transmitter. Go figure.People do make mistakes, but my follow-up email was apparently read by the same person who gummed up the original request. A simple repair request has now turned into a time-wasting Tarbaby."
3,it's ok for some...,"What the F6 doesn't do: 1. allow user to time splits. Kind of important if the user is a runner. 2. have a ""fitness test"" function.Ergo, it's not so great for experienced runners who are training for a race, wanting to really improve, etc.There are also a few functions that are not so intuitive on the F6. Mine will occasionally switch off the BPM screen to another screen that displays what may or may not be my percentage of time ""in the zone."" The screen switches at what appears to be random times and maybe I haven't read the manual avidly enough...What the F6 does: 1. it sets up easily and is comfortable to wear. 2. easily stores and retrieves data. 3. Occasionally loses HR signal when the user is wearing a lot of clothes over the chest strap.It's a good unit for beginners and intermediate exercisers. Perhaps not so great for runners."
5,Pretty good heart rate monitor,It works perfectly as it claims to does. Band is pretty comfortable and I have no complains about the watch.
3,Good product !,This product is for person who never exercise before and now is working out. Easy to use and do settings. Good product!
3,Polar Review,"Good product, does what it is supposed to do. May not be 100% accurate, but close enough given the price."
4,Polar F6 Heart Rate Monitor--Review by Gift Recipient,"I received this monitor as a gift, and am pleased with my use of it for monitoring my heart rate during cardiac rehab exercise. For that purpose it has performed quite satisfactorily. The only reason that I gave it only four stars is that I find the advanced functions a bit overwhelming, with very little explanation provided in the user's manual. This is particularly true for the PC communications functions, which I have yet to investigate and/or attempt. When I have had more experience with the device, I feel that I will be equally satisfied, but I would like more detail in the user manual."
4,Product Great - But container not as pictured,"The lotion and fragrance is what I expected but it came in just a tube, not the pretty bottle as picturedin the ad. I ordered that special one becuase it matched the perfume & cologne containers I already have.oh well what you see is not always what you get but i will still have a nice fragrance on me...."
3,Steve Stone Remembers a Legend,"I wasn't a Cub fan growing up, but I watched the WGN games almost everyday in the summer and I came to enjoy the broadcast team of Harry and Steve. Steve Stone is one of the most underrated broadcasters on television and the anecdotes he provides for the book are truly gems.Steve loved Harry quite a bit, and blasts former Cub play by play man Milo Hamilton who was particularly ugly to Harry before and after his death. But the subtext of the early chapters is that Harry had some flaws, and Harry and Steve had their ups and downs during their career together. It would have been easy to gloss over that reality, but it's a credit to Stone that he paints a very human picture of a baseball legend."
5,A must have for baseball fans,"I absolutely loved this book. I laughed, I cried and then did some more laughing. Even if you are not a die hard Cubs fan, this is one book you must have. Steve Stone did a great job showing us the side of Harry we didn't get to see."
5,A real treat to read,"Don't think that you need to be a Cubs' fan to enjoy this book.I actually chose to read this book for a class paper on great American journalists. I had a hard time convincing my professor that Harry was indeed a journalist and not simply an entertainer. After thoroughly enjoying this book, I think I convinced the prof - I got a 99% on the paper.If you have a love for the game of baseball, you will surely find this book entertaining. As someone now in sports communications with a professional baseball team, I recommend this book to all my co-workers. It's a great way to learn about aspects of the game that most fans would never know about - and it's about a guy everyone feels they already know.Perhaps one of the most disappointing things about biographies is that they somehow tarnish the memory or reputation of the book's subject. This book will simply make you love Harry even more."
4,"It could be, it should be, it is: Holy Cow, a must-read!","Harry Caray introduced me to baseball as I sat recovering from a traffic accident. For three days, I sat on a couch and watched baseball, courtesy of a friend's satellite dish. I was hooked not just by the sport, the voice or the myth but by the way Harry brought baseball right into the living room. The phrase that did it: ""One more biscuit for breakfast and that ball would have been out of here!"" Being a Bud man myself, and a Cubs fan, Stoney's collection of Harry tales is a classic. So grab a nice cold Budweiser, put on the game and spend a few minutes visiting Harry just one more time."
5,A Must for Any Cubs Fan,"Steve Stone opens up about his personal and working relationship with Harry Caray in this book. The many anecdotes will not only bring back many fond memories, but will also shed some light on parts of his life that most people don't know about. For example, he wasn't really drunk up there in that booth. He was just acting so fans could relate. Harry was always one for showmanship, and he was one of the best at it. If you miss Harry, you need to read this...it will help."
5,Hoist your Budwieser and sing along!,"""Take Me Out to the Ballgame ..."" Steve Stone, Harry's last partner in the broadcast booth, does a great job of remembering the indomitable and irreplaceable Harry. The reader will find lots of heartwarming and heart-rending anecdotes of our beloved icon. Stoney gives us Harry - warts & all. Where's Harry? He's in Heaven - leading a rousing rendition of the 7th inning stretch!"
5,A fun and easy to read book about a baseball legend,I enjoyed this book very much and wished it lasted more than two plane rides.
2,Harry the egomaniac,"After reading this book, I am convinced that Harry is a self-important, arrogant, spiteful & phony man who will go through great lengths to make sure he's in the spotlight at all times. The story where Josh Lewin went to thank Harry for giving his grandmother joy by listening to Harry do Cub games before she died, only for Harry to arrogantly dismiss him was very disturbing. As a huge fan of his growing up in the 80's, I was very disappointed to find out what a phony & a poser he really was.There is no controversy in this book whatsoever, if that's what you're looking for. In fact, it's a pretty good bootlicking session. This read shows that Steve Stone is as bland a writer as he is an announcer. VERY vanilla."
5,Great Tribute,"This book will make you laugh cry, and just say ""wow"". Steve Stone is the perfect person to write this book. Every baseball fan should read this book!"
5,Stock up on batteries!!,"My 2 year old loves these cars. I had bought this car in August, and the race track during for Christmas. These cars are motion sensitive meaning they are easy for a young child to rev the engines up. My son loves seeing the cars moving on carpet and on the track. There is also an off switchI wanted to say that these cars DO require 3 batteries that are included (3AA). I had seen a review that said they do not require batteries. With that said with constant use and turning the toy off when not in use, the batteries die after a few days.."
5,Great toy! Why didn't they make these when I was kid?!!!,"Brought it for my nephew, he's 2, for Christmas this year. According to my sister, he was thrilled when he set it on the floor and it took off, with him running after it. Good exercise for him.However, my sister was startled when she received the package and heard a vibrating, zooming sound. She didn't know what was in it so she opened it before Christmas and my nephew was so happy he started playing with it.Why don't they package them without the battery inside the toy or have it turned off?It was suppose to be a surprise."
2,Dissapointing,Animation is weak and story line a bit complex for kids to follow. Action and Characters are outdated and not enjoyable compared t other more recent Mecha titles.
5,A Jewel of a Film,"A touching and lovely nod to Hollywood and the dreamers who people the streets along Hollywood Boulevard. Quirky, charming and compelling characters take us on a journey with a young woman who wakes up in front of Graumann's Chinese Theatre with no memory of who she is or how she got to the walk of fame. What follows is a poignant story of the dreamers. Beautiful performances. Sybil Temtchine is a delight."
3,Feels like Twilight Zone,"This film is just okay, probably more like a 2.5. I felt like watching something before I went to bed so I gave it a go. What it suffers from most is its basic premise, the idea that Hollywood is a place of dreams for those who live there and everyone would like to be part of the glamor. Okay...and??? Even with that, don't expect super deep insights. The girl, who says very little during the film, doesn't help and the dialog drags when she does talk. My title really says it all. It feels very much like an old Twilight Zone episode with an insightful but less than startling ending. It would have been better as a thirty minute short or a short story with lots of internal dialog."
2,Molly Myers Review Standard Review,"I am employing the review standard which Molly Myers has introduced to me to review this book: because the author cannot possibly speak every language from the countries he writes about in this book, he cannot be considered an expert and therefore noone should buy this book. Because as Molly so intelligently points out, you wouldnt buy a book about China by someone who doesnt speak Chinese."
3,"Italian lesson, and good movie !","This DVD is produced not as a movie but as an Italian lesson (using the movie)by a well-known Utah University . In this respect, it is a great lesson of Italian, but it is not the greatest visual quality. This did not bother me because I happen to seek the Italian lesson. However, I usually like my movies crisp and clean, and this DVD version does not qualify for such specialty. I though the potential buyer should be told! Otherwise, I love the movie...!"
5,Filme de derroteros existenciales y frustraciones sociales,"Una película que encierra todas las claves del cine comprometido con los valores del propio cine. Es decir, la fragmentación del tiempo y del espacio; la detención del tiempo (Woody Allen haría lo mismo algunos años después); las referencias al propio cine; la emoción y los sentimientos como verdaderos hilos conductores del drama; los giros del lenguaje audiovisual que revoluciona rto lo establecido en conductas semiológicas; la vida que cambia, los personajes cambian y sin embargo todo queda igual. Film magistral en que la historia de cuatro amigos sirve de excusa para sumergirnos en las azarosas vidas de personas comunes y corrientes con sus derroteros existenciales y con sus frustraciones sociales. Espléndida y sentidas actuaciones de Nino manfredi, Steffano satta Flores, Stephania Sandrelli y un Vittorio Gassman único. Una de las películas más bella de la historia. Para ver y volverla a ver hasta el hastío."
5,Clarification !,"The Second edition of this DVD has been available since 2001. The first edition, which went to the menu after every scene, is no longer available. Neither version cut any scenes. The DVD now being sold at this site and others is the complete, uncut movie and can be viewed without interruption. I apologize for the confusion caused by my earlier explanation."
3,Why does the DVD not play the entire movie?,"This DVD version of C'eravamo tanto amati was created under a non-thatrical, educational software license. We did not have the legal right to show the movie in its entirety. It was originally created as an Italian language tool. We have since purchased the theatrical rights and are in the process of remastering the DVD to allow continuous play. The new version should be available in May.Harold H. Hendricks, project director."
5,one movie about directors and life,"Movie about other movies is commmon (Trauffats ""la nuit ammericaine"" one of the best, other in the absence of ideas directors do remakes), but over directors, politics and social life is rare. This movie is a tribute to great italian directors: De Sica, Rosselini and Fellini. Besides it shows how the social life changes in Italy after wars, since Mussolini times up to the sixties having love as background. I hope all Scola's movies will be in DVD soon, as La Cena and other."
4,very good but could be better,"I really like this book, and I was glad to see that they included a bit of the rich histories of the neighborhoods of Atlanta. I wish, however that they had included more neighborhoods (no Cabbagetown? Reynoldstown?) and more detail on each of them. Also it might be helpful for newcomers to know more about crime rates by area, ratings of school systems, etc. than is included in this book."
3,"More Love, More Lotion!","If you mix it all up, Saturday Night Lotion is a success.It's not a perfect album for sure, but I like it. There are a few outstanding tracks, my favourite being the intro and track 10. Existing fans of the famous Plump sound will love this album as it remains tricky and happy as ever, with fun buzzes and bleeps in all the right places- if you're looking for dark sounds, look elsewhere!Beatwise, it's closer to Y4k by Hyper, or Y4k by Phil K than DJ Ils or Way Out West. Fans of fast-paced, very complex, or aggressive breaks won't find much joy in this album; but if you're looking for good vibes and rhythms on a long drive, count on the Plump DJs keep you company."
3,Coming up a little short---,"Coming up a little short--- This item received from Amazon is 67"" long, not 78.5"" as described. The color appears white but is actually light grey. It arrived promptly."
1,"FYI, this is gray colored...","This is a gray colored raceway, and the picture here makes it looks white. I need white, so this was a wasted purchase. Very misleading and as far as I can tell there is no color description."
4,Good service,"What is to say? It is a piece of plastic wiring duct. Delivery was timely by the supplier If this is not enough, I do not know what else to say. It is a piece a plastic channel in which wires are placed."
2,Need a good Mouse,"With in a week of getting this mouse, the scroll wheel started squeeking and the cursor started to move on it's own and half the time making me go to a link/command when I click."
2,Not good.,"Only the outside appearance of the product is good. It is not good quality, even if you do not use it, and leave it somewhere else on its own, without putting anything on it, it deflates in just a matter of hours. I tried two and both are the same. So, if you do not want to buy something that is not usable, then definitely avoid this one."
1,"Don't waste your money, Do your reasearch","Seriously guys. DON'T buy this Tv unless you want to replace it in two years! This model of TV has a huge KNOWN problem to lose its audio after 18-24 months. We bought this TV 2 years ago and it was amazing until one day the sound decided to shut off and never work again. Sharp has terrible customer service and if you were to get the sound problem fixed it would cost you $300 and upwards, its not worth your money.If this tv didnt become a complete peice of trash after 2 years then maybe I would give it a better score."
2,Why is this not full HD resolution for this price?,Sharp would have had a winner here if they had made the choice to offer full native 1920 x 1080 resolution. Sharps new years resolution should be to offer 1080p on All their monitors instead of tying to trick people into thinking that anything less is state of the art.
4,Neat little stickers,"I love these things.They were easy to place on, however, some got crinkled while being placed (human error I suppose).Some of them are starting to fade after about 5 months of use.I really wish I could figure out how to get Microsoft Word to let me type in Japanese..."
4,Bushwacker 31911-11 Extend-a-Fender Flares,"Installed on my '99 Tacoma, took a couple hours. The rears fit quite well, most holes lined up OK though a couple required some elbow grease to align. Fronts did not fit nearly as well, no matter how I tried a small gap between the fender and the flares remained - not sure if this will affect long-term performance. Holes did not line up quite as well with the front set, took more wrestling to get them on. Once installed they look and perform just fine. They're expensive items but I needed them and am glad I got them."
5,Adult Sanity,"If you value your sanity, get the kids ONE EACH. Great toy they'll play forever if grandma joins in."
5,Thank heavens for this toy!,"My son got this when he was about 18months old, and already facinated with letters and numbers. He learned how to use it in seconds flat, and has kept him entertained for ages at a time. It is especially great in the car!! Very portable for him, and packs easily. The write on panel has become pushed in a bit. It still works fine, but obviously doesn't hold up to the weight of a toddler drawing on it (they push HARD!) But he is never frustrated by it, which is a blessing. The only annoyance is that he always hands it off to me to write numbers or letters for him (but honestly, can I complain?)"
3,Does not hold up to the regors of several small children.,My three children loved the game but it could not past the test of time. Both had only 2 to 3 months on each one of them with average play.
2,"too small, unfortunately","I really like the Magna Doodle when it's big enough. Unfortunately, this one is too dang small. We bought two of these for our kids (ages 2 and 3) for trips. The drawing surface is a good size, and the pad pverall is easy for the kids to handle -- but the ""wiping"" action doesn't clear the screen in less than 3 or 4 passes, and the action on it is sticky. As a result, most of the image remains until Mommy or Daddy can take a minute and work with the thing to get it off.The larger size doesn't have this issue, by the way. I'd recommend that one."
2,Read the unabridged version -- it's much better,"Opal Whitely's story is an utterly amazing thing in every respect. Her life as a child, her exquisite sensitivity, and her way of expressing herself -- it's all just amazing.That said, I don't understand this version! Compared to Jane Boulton's original adaptation (if that's what you'd call it), ""Opal, Journal of an Understanding Heart,"" this seems gutted and meaningless. Maybe it's meant to be less sad for young children, I don't know. Read the original version."
2,"Cats don't like it, but seems to work.","After purchasing this item and using it once I thought...this can't be right. The cats hated it. I could barely get one clump (doesn't come out in drops, more like gel) into each ear without them freaking out and running. It has a horrible alcohol smell. Both cats have run and hide for half a day and shake their heads all night, but the next day they do seem happier. I have used it twice - only one drop in each ear, rub, let cats run and hide. Then I gave off one day and did it again the next day. I am going to try and use it for a week and if their ears don't clear up take them into the vet. I was told by a vet they didn't have ear mites, just dirty ears... but not sure if they picked it up in a month as their ears looked a bit dirty. They never really itched their ears, but they did have the black stuff in them. I am going to give it a go since the cats do seem happier the next day... but it was a concern after the first time I gave the medicine to them."
2,It helps. But imagine putting Icy Hot in your ears. Now you get the idea....,"After treating the cat with this stuff, and having her run off and hide before we could get the excess out of her ears, we found the cat coming to us drooling like crazy. She was trying to get this stuff out of her ears and got it in her mouth... We managed to get it on our hands and it is hot like icy hot rub.... It certainly is cleaning the cats ears out, and she scratches far less, but it is really not a pleasant thing for her...I guess this is what we get for taking in an orphaned cat...."
2,pass on this one,If you look really hard you will find helpful information in this book. The issue I have with it is in the way it is written. The use of font variations and size is very distracting. I am not sure who they thought would read this book; I would not read it again
2,Not for industrial,The book does a good job in illustrating why the little things we do is important in creating return sales but it does not dive into the world of industrial sales. The customer of this book is most often the retail consumer. The world of customer loyalty in industrial relationships is motivated by different needs and not addressed by this book.
5,Chock Full of Practical Techniques,"Understand, I am biasd towards Jeffrey Gitomer. Never met him but I have read every book he has written, all of them several times because they are all packed with common sense principles and techniques that could help anyone in any business and in any personal relationship.This book was the hardest for me to read not because of the way it was written but rather I would read a page or two or three and get an idea and my mind would go off into lala land thinking of how I or my company could use the advice to improve. Then back to the book, then back to lala land. Jeffrey backs up a lot of his recommendations with personal stories and in occasionally provides a self-test (which are always great).I would highly recommend this book for everyone in sales and who is not in sales of some sort so I would recommend it to everyone who is breathing."
1,Save your money and time,This book is simply a re-hash of books from good authors work. Nothing new except for the distracting and annoying font/spacing changes he makes to stretch this out to look like a book rather than the newletter it really is.To all of you folks that that gave this good reviews: Did you actually learn anything here? You actually didn't know your customers paid your salary before dropping $20 on this book? You didn't know positive attitude was important?Get Real: Gitomer is a salesmen. Good enough to get us to buy the book. He is not a business leader.Just Try This: Read books from people who have actually trained or changed organizations to change rather than point out the obvious.
1,"Practically Worthless, should be Priceless",Heaven help the poor customer service reps when the all-powerful sales and marketing surrealists attempt to put this superficial tome into action.
3,"Okay, but can be skipped","After reading the book a couple of times (yes, I spent the time doing that) I find there is some substance here but not a lot. It could be I was expecting a lot more from this book than it had to offer. There was nothing in here I didn't already know it was just more of an affirmation. I found it more useful as a vacation or shopping directory (go here for good service). In the future I would only recommend this book for people very new to the business world either in or leading the customer service segments."
5,This BOOK is priceless...,"This book is only for those who wish to give the most outstanding service possible...those who want to hear ""WOW!"" again & again. The book is clear, easy to understand, and humorous. It's also hard-hitting & forces the serious service provider to take a hard look at themselves and their businesses. I gave a service orientation for my co-workers based largely on the contents of this book. The results were astounding. Even the most jaded of our service providers were overflowing with questions, comments and excitement. Anyone who works with the public should read this book. Just a note: If you are curious as to what happens if you take the opposite approach, check out another great book, ""It's Not My Department"" by Peter Glenn. The examples in his book spotlight a lot of the ""customer service nightmares & horror stories"" that tend to occur when apathy is the prime emotion guiding service."
4,Interesting Read,This book takes what we apply at Ormond Computer Company and brings it to the next level of Customer Service.The book entices you take a hard look at how you and your company approach the current service level and tempts you to re-analyze where you want your company to be in the eyes of your clients.It is a relatively easy read and very humerous at times while keeping the subject matter serious...it will make you think about your approach to customer service.
4,Tell Everyone You Know,"Easy read, great information. Solid tips. Relates to all sales jobs, and All Sales associates who ""want"" to succeed, will get it!"
2,What about creation of value for customers?,"From the tone and content of his book, Gitomer apparently believes that customer loyalty comes from superior service. In my experience, this message is a very superficial and one-dimensional approach to understanding customers. For well-known examples of companies doing a great job of creating loyal staff and customers - like USAA, Rosenbluth International, Fed Ex, State Farm, MBNA, Southwest Airlines and Ritz-Carlton - service is just one element of their success. Companies like these are so committed to their customers, every process is targeted at building value. Other than a page here and there, ""Customer Satisfaction is Worthless...."" offers a light snack on customer loyalty and the creation of value rather than a full meal of insight."
1,Horrible!,This book only saids trivial things.. full of cliche phrases you wont get anything from reading it... waste of money
1,Too much hype - no real content,"I bought the book to gain insight on giving good Customer Service and was really disappointed. The author completely says, even in the title, that customer satisfaction is worthless - which is completely untrue. No real plan given. Typical sales book - many pages with only a 8 word giant sentence printed on it (to fill space undoubtedly). Nice concept - no real content to run with and apply to a business. Sorry I spent the money (he did accomplish his purpose by getting me to buy his book!)"
5,"Absolutely AWESOME book, a must read for any business person.","Many, many great ideas in this book. Simply excellent. I have given this book to other business owners as gifts. One of my favorite sections is about PITAs (Pain in the Ass Customers). When you fire 3 of your PITA customers, you will receive many, many new good customers to replace the fired ones. He explains how this works in this book. Many other eye opening ideas and observations. You must buy this book. You will read it and re-read it many times over."
5,Your Solution to Dazzling Health and Enduring Relationships,"Ten years after he revolutionized the way we think about how men and women communicate in romantic relationships, in Mars and Venus Diet and Exercise Solution, John Gray tells us how the sexes differ when it comes to diet, exercise, sex, depression, and particularly brain chemistry. Why is it that so many of us rely on pills, alcohol, and food to be happy? Why are so many Americans overweight? Why are ADD and divorce so prevalent?In this comprehensive, readable, and fascinating study, Gray not only supplies intriguing answers but recipes, exercise plans, suggestions for energy-boosting, chemistry-altering foods that will become your lifeline to satisfying, passionate, and enduring relationships.Drs. Mary and John Valentis, authors of Romantic Intelligence: How to Be as Smart in Love as You are in Life."
1,John Gray is phoney,"Don't buy this book, please! The man is a complete fake. He's degrees are totally worthless. He is making money off of people looking for help and tricked into believing his marketing hype. Just do some research on Google and you'll discover the truth about him."
3,Not the best in the series,"My husband and I have read all of Dr. Grays books. His principles are really easy for us to follow because he is all Man and I am all Woman. But we had trouble with this one. That is because, even though the foods that are good for Mars, and the foods that are good for Venus, are different, we just have one refrigirater, so we got them mixed up. So we are still fat."
5,Informative,I found thhis book very informative but easy to understand.It helps explain a lot of things and gives solutions that are do-able.
5,This is an amazing book!,Thank you Dr. Gray.My wife and I have read all of your books and this one really has changed our life. Thank you for giving us a natural solution for diet and exercise. It really works....
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought two copies of this book after hearing him on COAST to COAST AM. I planned to give one to my sister. Well I should have read the reviews from normal people first. I notice the excellent reviews all come from other authors or co-authors or those somehow in the diet or doctor field. I am having a difficult time getting anything out of this book. I find it's presentation frustrating, and a lot of gobblety gook. I tried to find specific information I heard on the show and am having an aweful time doing so. I like a book where I can go to a chapter you ""think"" is about what it says it is about, and goes to the point without fancying up and saying a lot of nothing in the text. The highlighted text on each page throughout the book is very distracting. The font is too small (age I assume). I am sooo disappointed. ;("
3,Mars and Venus Diet and Exercise Solution rocks!,"Although the content of this book is somewhat repetitious, the suggestions for boosting metabolism and improving diet are great. I'm drinking the activated water in the morning and bouncing and shaking my way to a day with increased metabolism and energy. I'm using the Isagenix shakes in the morning as part of this program and so far so good."
1,"Good Salesman, Bad Advice","Dr. Grey, with a PhD from a university closed down by the State of California as a diploma mill, is a great salesman and story teller. Although his thesis in his new diet and exercise book is intriguing, Grey does not give any references whatsoever as to from where his theories about hormones and their role in nutrition come. Some facts in the books seem dubious, ""..the brain uses 20 percent of the calories we consume.""However, because the caloric intake of his nutrition system should be less than the reader would normally take, participants in the system should show a loss of weight over time. And because the theory is novel, a reader will also tend to believe everything Grey says, as believe they ""feel"" better.I would feel safer about his nutrition ideas if he had added an appendix of references to scientific or even to popular literature that could confirm his ideas as good science."

3,The Mars & Venus Diet and Exercise Solution,"This book has some excellent information on the science of brain chemistry and how it pertains to health, diet and fitness. Dr. Gray does a fine job of explaining this complex information.What he neglects to do is outline his diet approach in a visual manner. The book lacks charts and examples for creating the all important breakfast shake. The shake he describes has so many cross references and rules that I'm afraid to even try making it. The Isagenix, which he suggests as an alternative, is expensive (over $40 for 14 shakes) and you have to be prepared to wait 2 weeks for delivery.If Dr. Gray had added just a few examples of how to use the information he so eloquently describes, I would have given this book 5 stars and be mixing up a shake right now."
5,"THE best tasting, MILDEST Habanero Sauce","Taste may be a subjective choice. With that stated, this product *was* truly the best tasting Habanero sauce I have tried to date. It was full of flavor - NOT heat. Heat index may have been comparable to Tobasco brand Smoked Chipotle flavor sauce - milder than the original red sauce. Very mild, considering it's habanero-based.As of 2013, this particular brand disappeared perhaps over a year ago. So sad. Scattered reviews share the same thoughts... Phenomenal flavor, little heat. But, no longer produced."
1,WORST BANK EVER,"OK, if I could rate this 0 stars, I would. Within a week of getting this item, we realized it counted wrong. Also as you know, kids have a tendancy to ""accidentally"" tap on things. If you tap this bank on the top, it thinks you put in more money. I wish my bank did that...hahaha. There is basically no way to know when you have enough coins to make a roll because when you push the button to tell you the amount of each coin, it resets if you're not extremely quick. Basically, this does not work. I even tried to return it, but since it was a gift, we have no receipt and we had already thrown the box away, so now we're stuck with it. If you really want a bank for your kids, please don't get this one. Your kids deserve better!"
2,"Sorts well, but...","Have had three of these machines-company sent a free one after two went dead. What happens is coins get stuck in drop tray, causing the motor to continue to spin, until the motor dies from over-heating."
3,HOW MUCH THE COIN WRAPPER CAN CARRY,THE COIN WRAPPER SHOULD CARRY MORE THAN $35.I HAVE TOO ASK MY MOM TOO GET CASHED 4 TIMES A WEEK ALMOST.IT SHOULD CARRY $395.
3,Not as good with a perspective of years,"I read ""Reminiscences"" shortly after it was published. I was in my mid-20s and didn't have the perspective gained by another fifty years of life and reading. MacArthur was a remarkable man by any measure, especially his own. He is a good writer and makes his case well, so well that it was a pleasure to read. He is utterly convincing to a reader who has not read more of MacArthur's life and times. But . . . there is another view. For a more balanced perspective read David McCullough's ""American Caesar"" or David Halberstam's ""The Coldest Winter,"" a history of the Korean War. I mark the latter as the best of the lot and one of the finest pieces of historical writing I've read in a lifetime of reading. MacArthur looms large and terribly flawed."
5,Recommended for military readers,"This is an outstanding book. Great for active duty military O3 and O4 level audience. This book covers operational art, lines of effort, joint planning, end states, civil-military relations, military budget cuts, etc. All the topics mentioned in professional military schools today. For example the Naval War College still (2012) uses a case study on the Inchon Landing (which MacArthur addresses in this book). Concepts like how to fight a withdrawal, trading space for time, etc. It's all here. The reader realizes that on a fundamental level there are no new problems. Today's military faces the same conceptual struggles that previous generations have dealt with before. BUT this is much more than simply doctrine or volumes of After-Action Reports. It is an exciting true-life story. I love it!"
4,Inimitable,"A half century after his abrupt removal from command in the Korean War, MacArthur's autobiography presents a fascinating combination of prescience and error -- much like the man himself. His heartfelt belief that ""there is no substitute for victory"" was proved wrong by our decisive triumph in the Cold War, achieved in spite of stalemate in Korea and outright defeat in Vietnam. On the other hand, his insistence over the years that America ought to be paying more attention to Asia (vs. Europe) seems to be validated not only by the rise of China, Japan and India but also by our current predicament dealing with the Islamic world. Right or wrong, MacArthur was always eloquent, and this book delivers his own inimitable take on the violent first half of the 20th century."
5,Great!,We bought this to add to our building collection for our son's homeschooling material. It is a fun game that is also educational. Would recommend this to any parent.
5,still our favorite,"This was our first Sesame Street/Elmo video, and when our 4-month old saw it for the first time, she lost all interest in Baby Einstein (except for the Day on the Farm one). We now have about 10-12 more Sesame Street DVDs, thinking more of a good thing has to be good--but this one has remained her favorite. She is 11 months now and still claps and smiles at her favorite parts. She seems to prefer the Sesame Street DVDs that have one or a few ""themes"". This one starts out with Grover delivering an important ""package"" to Oscar, then it's followed by a series of ""cookie"" themes (including the familiar ""C is for Cookie"" song), and my personal favorite, the peacock that won't do the peacock dance despite Grover's showing him a training film made in China of little girls doing the peacock dance. It's great to have this to completely entertain our baby when I need that--or to hold her in my lap while she watches it, mesmerized."
2,"4 Stars for an ""Elmo"" Video 0 Stars as a Retrospective","Plain and Simple - when a show hits 35 years the people that made the show should be smart enough to realize that Parents who saw the show as Kids want their own Kids to watch what they had watched - to share memories with them.In this case, its yet another Elmo video. Fine, OK, things change. But don't misrepresent what you're going to see - I really wanted to show my boy Mr. Hooper, and the guy with the pies that slips down the stairs, and when they thought Snuffy wasn't real, and all the old characters.The stuff is on tape Sesame Street Execs - can you please put out ""Sesame Street - Best of Season 1, 2, 3? I'd buy everything from Season 1 - Season 6. I bet I wouldn't be the only one either....Please put out some older Sesame material.... Don't slip in a few seconds of Mr. Hooper in an Elmo tape."
1,"3 stars for the episode that aired on PBS, 1 for the DVD","Wow, do I miss the sesame street from when it was good!! The Dvd wasn't like the TV show that PBS aired. The TV show had a 5-10 minute segmant on scenes from sesame street from the beginning of the show until now, the DVD din't do that at all, and that was the reason I bought the DVD! They have a split second of Mr. Hooper, they briefly show Maria and Louis getting married, didn't bother to show them meeting for guacamole for the first time, they showed when miles was adopted, but don't bother to point out olivia. They don't talk about when Gina came to sesame street. This is not a reminisant look back at all. It's let's put out yet another elmo dvd, and dumb down the show even more. I think that the only thing you learn in this episode is the one song about counting to 10. Don't bother with this one, if you want to reminise, go pick up a copy of christmas eve on sesame street."
2,"Very Basic, more Everyday than Gourmet . . .","It's not a bad book and in general the ingredients are readily available, but the recipies are pretty simple and sometimes plain. Not really Gourmet at all. If you already have lots of raw books, this is good to add to your collection, but try some others first if you are just getting started."
4,A Classic,"Nomi Shannon, one of the first ""seerers"" to embrace wholly the raw foods, living foods lifestyle, after attending a session at the Hippocrates Health Institute, and then working and educating there, has gifted us all with one of the best living foods recipe books ever written.""The Raw Gourmet"" is the standard by which all else are measured, in my opinion, still.Easy to follow, with recipes that not only delight the palate, but the purse and time allowance, and offer incredible images so one can actually see how splendid the meal will look as well, Nomi has captured the beauty and ease of raw, living foods for us.A well-known proponent of natural health and healing, as well as a certified Hippocrates Health Educator, Nomi is an expert upon whom I have relied much over the last ten years of my own living foods lifestyle. I always highly recommend ""The Raw Gourmet"" to my clients as well.[...]"
4,"Pretty, yummy and doable recipes","I've owned this book for a few months and have made a handful of recipes. Beautiful photography, coherent directions, good intro on raw foods along with a basic set of menus and an overview on the basics of food combining. My chief beef with the book -- and the reason I'm rating it 4 stars instead of 5 -- is the sloppy index, which I've been correcting as I find errors."
2,There are better raw books...,"My husband and I are transitioning to raw foods. We have read numerous books and were prompted to buy The Raw Gourmet because of the cover and the incredible photos inside. Truly, the pictures are stunning. Unfortunately, the recipes lack that certain something. We made a few, but there were no instructions on exactly how to get the results she got in her pics. In some recipes, the photo didn't even show the same ingredients she lists in the recipe! I returned the book to the health food store after one week. There are better raw food books out there. See my review on Rainbow Green..."
3,Time consuming,"This seems like a great book, but, very time consuming. Also, I live in the outback and its difficult to find some of the ingredients. One thing that was confusing was on page 200 it explains foods that shouldn't be eaten together, such as oranges and dates...yet, on page 186 there is a recipe for Orange-Date Dessert Bars. Go figure."
2,Looks beautiful - but not very substantial,"What a disappointment! Most of the recipies seems to be for sauces and salad dressings - with not many ideas about substantial main course dishes. Fine for faddy eaters, no good at all for someone trying to keep a family healthy."
3,dog loves his o-oh,"but the velcro that encloses the voice box doesn't close well, so DO watch the animal with this toy. Of course, the dog tries to get through the velcro opening."
4,Great book,"Great book, highly recommended, very useful for who wants learn english and do well on toefl. Take it and you won't be disapointed"
3,i bought a wrong edition,"I have bought a wrong edition book ,but I cannot change. His service is good."
1,"The simplest of words , nothing more complex than intricate","This is the most useless book I have read in a long time. I routinely answer only about 50% of the readers digest vocabulary questions correctly and yet, in this book I didn't find a single unknown word."
4,"Great book light, but short battery","Very useful book light. Fits comfortably on right ear and light is enough to read easily by. Light adjustment is simple to align with your eyes and once you do, you can read for hours. Works much better than the clip-on lights to your book. I just wish the battery life was longer."
2,A bit disappointing,"I recently bought this product from the grocery store. There were absolutly no directions on how to put this thing around your ear. The company need to think smarter, not everyone knows how to attach to ear. It took me many trys to get this thing on. This was downright wrong. I have to give credit that the ear piece was comfortable. I was able to read well. Yes, I had to strain my neck alot. I also found that the piece only attaches to right ear. What if some people don't have a right ear? DISCRIMINATION!! Omega should have made it usable for both ears."
5,this is the best book I've come across!,"I had read good things about this book, and that is why I purchased it. However, this book has more than surpassed my expectations, and is brilliant!The concept of learning the preterit-tense first is incredibly valuable, and is a nice change from learning six tenses of each verb under study (ie. the textbook method). The book is also interesting reading, and some of the conversations in Spanish are funny (Roberto es terrible).This book is an absolute must have for anybody interested in learning Spanish."
3,Not much different than any other Language book,"I did not find this to be significantly different that any other Spanish Language book that i have used in the past--it is organized a bit different and offers new exercises, but without previous studies, especially pronunciation, I don't think that it is especially useful"
3,Interesting approach to learning Spanish,"The approach he used to teach Spanish is different from any other book I've read. It is hard to describe but basically, he points out all the similarities between English and Spanish so you end up not having to memorize as many words. I didn't like the way he started with the past tense of verbs instead of the present tense as I was also using other books and found that confusing. I think this book is good in conjunction with other more traditional books."
1,Not a good book to learn Spanish,"I think this book is simplistic and does not teach communicative Spanish, it is just a list of words that relate to each other but if you do not have a context you can never use those words."
3,Fair,Simply not what I was looking for. A bit in volved for general tourism. I suspect it would work well for someone wanting an in-depth study.
4,The Best!,"This is by far the best book for adults learning Spanish on the fly. She teaches past, present and future tenses together so you can actually communicate! The Andy Worhol illisturations are fun too."
4,great book but needs an update,"This is a great book, espcially to use in conjuction with a real spanish class. But beware, its is out of date on a few things. The most glaring being the rules for using indirect object pronouns. Other things that would benefit from an update is the spelling of certain pretrite conjucgations. But none of these problems are show stopper. On the whole the book will do a good job helping you cement in basic spanish."
5,This is a great book!,"I don't know if I can put it into words. Most mortals don't pick up text books or language tutorials and read them cover to cover, mainly because most books of this type are boring. I'm not the kind of person that can do that. And yet I did . This book is very different. Vocabulary and Verbs are presented in a very simple format. It all makes perfect sense. The author makes it all fun ... somehow. She was a great writer. The book introduces the past tense first, which is how most of us talk to each other. To talk in present tenses is something to aspire to as Joni Mitchell reminded us in ""Cari get out your key"". In real life Madrigals approach makes perfect sense."
4,Good refresher to rapidly expand vocabulary,"If you learned Spanish in the past but rusty now, this book is very helpful to quickly re-establish a your vocabulary again."
1,Ridiculous,This book is a waste of money. It will NOT teach you Spanish. Don't be fooled into buying this or waste one second with this highly unhelpful book.
4,book,"easy to use Spanish book. I will actually use it more next year when my daughter has her first high school Spanish class and I ""relearn"" it along with her!"
3,Good Book- but not worth the price,"This is generally a good approach to french and could help you make some elementary progress, however by the time i got it i had already studied french for 6 months so I didn't learn a lot of new things. The book is out of print and very difficult even fing a second hand copy. In my opinion you should spend over the top to get this book and I dont believe that it is worth more than 30. There are a lot of equally good french books available on Amazon."
2,I learned how to speak Spanish in six months.,"I used this book to learn how to speak, read and write in Spanish. After finishing the book, I drove to Mexico City. I was able to ask for directions when I got lost, carry on conversations in restaurants, find my way in the city, and speak with a Spanish language accent. I have read many other texts but this is by far the best and I use it to teach Spanish."
5,Great basic learning book!,"We were heading to Spain for a month long vacation and figured learning some basic words wouldn't hurt, at least we could get around with knowledge of the very very basics. This book does just that and then some. We went through the book a few times, and re-read it over about 3 times (each time takes between 2-4 hours depending on your speed and need for repetition). That's all it took for us and made our vacation that much more fun since we broke out in our own weird broken Spanish dialect, but not bad enough to not be understood! I would recommend this book for those looking to learn the basics. I guess for more advanced learning, other programs like Rosetta Stone are probably better (and cost a fortune!)."
5,Spanish made easy,Absolutely the best self-teaching guide I have found. The keys make learning so much easier. This book will assist you with so many aspects of the Spanish language.
4,spanish book,Enjoy the book on spanish. It is very helpful for learning spanish and I am sure for those who are brushing up on spanish also. She uses alot of methods to help the student learn Spanish the easiest way possible.
5,Best book for learning Spanish,I have read lots of books on learning Spanish over the years. This one is the best. It explains things in a way that is easier for native English speakers to understand Spanish. It explains words that are identical in English and Spanish. It explains verb tenses in an easy to understand manner for all the tenses. It also helps you to start forming conversations. Plus it has illustrations by Andy Warhol!!
5,This is a Cool Book,"This book has a unique approach that finds common words that parallel both in English and Spanish. I haven't had time to read through the whole book, but what I have read has been interesting."
4,Madrigals magic key to Spanish,"I like the book, I like the way they group similar words together, but I don't like in the Ebook that there are no page or chapter numbers so I can see what page I'm on, and can go back to another. the book has verb conjugations lined up, but in the Ebook they are out of line, which is annoying to have to figure if I look up for the next conjugation or look down, it's not as easy too use."
4,In the tradition of Orwell and Nietzsche...,"I have been looking for a copy of this book since I read it several times (and subsequently gave it away) years ago. Especially fascinating is the authors' use of a ""border-crosser"" or guerrilla-type figure who, as one of the main characters, crosses boundaries between hyper-city and rural community in a post-Apocalyptic age, thus allowing us to reflect upon our own circumstances, plight, and so on as people caught between and inside fractured communities of all shapes and sizes and flavours. The book is imbued with Nietzschean values and has a tinge of Orwell's Burmese Days to it, in the sense that it conveys a tangible feeling of exile throughout (which 1984 does, as well). The authors have a gift of expressing philosophy in a novel that is both provocative and a joy to read. Write more, guys!"
5,Excellent Fantasy,"I loved this book. It is one of the greatest books that I have ever read. I suggest that anybody that wants to read a good story about a time and a place far away, yet seems so familiar, then get this book"
2,Save your money,"An expensive book with little meat. Whole chapters dedicated to basic electromagnetism. Nice if it was a primer on electromag but this is supposed to be a focused book.Buy ""Noise Reduction tech. in Electronic Systems"" Henry W. Ott. Much better book for the money."
4,Get it because everyone else references to it.,"This book is not as good as Ott's in both depth and clarity, but it is a classic in the field. You might well get it because everyone else references to it."
2,More confusion added to a confusing subject,In his book Morrison says he may have gotten a few things wrong. That statement is almost the extent of what he got right. But Ott's book. You won't be sorry.
2,Confusing themes...,"Although the ""Power"" section is relatively good, the ""Culture"" and ""Economics"" themes were unclear and mixed up. We had to read this for class and my classmates agree that maybe the themes for ""Culture"" and ""Economics"" should switch. It feels like there is more on economics in the culture section and more culture in the economics section.However, it was a good read and was helpful information. It was just confusing on which theme is which."
1,this one is a dud,This is a series of shoddy lectures (142) the author did and then had run off. It is a shallow thematic history on hte relations between China and japan with special emphasis on hte pre World War period. The guy is a historian of sorts and the global bit of the title is to hide just how shallow is his knowledge. Harvard have obviously little to do with their money if they publish weak drivel like this.
1,manga style,manga style means this book is a glorified comic book. i wish i had known before i bought.
3,"Problems In The ""I"" Of The Storm","You had me for 400 pages. Maybe I appreciate seaside tales because I was raised in land-locked Ohio. I couldn't wait to reopen the book, even when I discovered the bad guy a hundred pages earlier.Me? I? Awfully personal! That is the problem with the last one hundred pages. The point of view is first person. A very cynical, sexist, cocky and genuine first person. We know the bad guy. The narrator's partner is expendible. We are all in a hurricane. What's the problem? ""I"" can't be killed. Not by bullets, gas or ocean. ""I"" am narrating. ""I"" am alive. For 80% of the book, ""I"" wasn't relevant to the great tension & intrigue. There was no tension in the climax because ""I"" am alive.It is a shame for the author to have gone so far with a colorful plot, only to lose it at the end. In this case -- the ""I's"" don't have it."
4,"Great Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring read!","One of the more entertaining books I've read recently. Some of the most fun in print. The only thing Corey did not quip was that ""she had legs that would make a Bishop kick out a stain glass window...."""
3,I miss John's sarchasm..he was definitely not boring,"While I found portions of the story predictible, I still did not want to put the book down or end. I have read several of DeMilles books and will continue to enjoy his work. I like his women, they have substance and individuality. John Corey's jokes were entertaining and well placed. Who among us has not uttered some of the same sarchasms under their breath in similar situations?"
4,Couldn't help casting the movie,"What a great read, the kind of story that would translate well onto film. I found myself casting the movie - Tommy Lee Jones, Uma Thurman, Jeremy Irons."
4,Not bad. Not bad at all.,"First, I'd like to give the woman who wrote, ""My husband laughed out loud while reading this book. My friends recommended it. I found it a complete waste of time."" a ""10"" for her review. It confirms no book is for everybody. I, for one, have no plans to read War and Peace in the next decade or so! I found this book to be very different from the other DeMille books. In most of his other books, DeMille's graphic descriptions create a great deal of horror and suspense. DeMille took a very different approach in Plum Island. There wasn't much suspense and the potential for horror was mitigated by the odd personality of the main character. Still, it was a good, entertaining story."
2,Major disappointment,"A big disappointment after reading the very entertaining ""Gold Coast"". The premise of ""Plum Island"" is unlikely, and the plotline soon becomes predictable. Worst of all, the dialog is insipid to the point of distraction. (People talk like this in bad TV movies and in cheezy novels --but not in real life.)"
2,Waste of time,"What a disappointment! An adolescent, misogynistic (is there any other kind?) NY cop as the hero of an amateurish story filled with two dimensional characters. The writing and story seemed so obviosly aimed at a screenplay, I kept being distracted by wondering if the author had Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson in mind for the role. It certainly would be fitting for a cheesey Die Hard- or Lethal Weapon-IV. And the boat chase was right out of Patriot Games. ""It was a dark and stormy night..."" Jeez, Snoopy would have written a better tale. What on Earth kept this book on the Best Sellers List for so long?"
3,John Corey is a bad trip,"Intricately plotted and well written, but I don't think I have ever encountered a more unsympathetic lead character than John Corey. He is an annoying, odious lout. In this book he is in Long Island recuperating from a shooting. I doubt if that crime will ever by solved because the shooter could well be anyone who ever knew him for five minutes. His personality makes the various love scenes implausible. Would any woman want to be around him any more than necessary? It requires quite a suspension of disbelief. This guy got on my nerves to the extent that in every encounter with the villains, I was rooting for the bad guy to beat the hell out of him."
4,Great Read,I gave this book a four star rating because as soon as I finshed reading it I was a Nelson Demille fan for life. He has a great way of bring the story to life and John Corey is just the type of man that America needs.
5,Plum Island,"Nelson DeMille should be read every chance you get! Well written with lots of twists in the plot. Having lived on LI for 25 years, the places are real and the general geography correct. Plum Island does exist and is in fact a government restricted area, so one really does wonder about what takes place on the island. Demille's story consequently is very plausable. Put up your feet and enjoy this stunner!"
5,Awesome Story --- a page-turner,I loved this book and have now bought a ton of Nelsome DeMille so that I can read more about John Corey. Great character.
2,A bit much on the macho wise cracks,The story was ok. Overkill on the NY macho attitude. Not sure if I'll buy another DeMille book. I normally like murder mysteries but this one was too simplistic in the writing style.
2,The character development exceeds the plot,"Most thriller/mystery stories live and die by their plot lines. If that be the test, this one mostly dies. The author tips his hand (or perhaps wholly opens it) midway through the book. One gains the impression that he does so in order to use the balance of the book to sell an unsaleable plot. Without wshing to give it away, the entire plot hinges on a single unexplained (and unexplainable) assumption. Indeed, the only ""mystery"" in the last half of the book is the reader's (logical) reluctance to accept the profferred explanation of events. On the other hand, the author is a skillful writer, conveying a likeable protagonist and believeable dialogue. By far the most appealing aspect of the book is its insightful description of the residents of this small section of Long Island. The author's evocative recreation of his characters raises the product of a wholly unconvincing plot to an average book."
3,Odd Storyline,"This is the first book by the author I have read. Although not a masterpiece, I believe I will seek out some of his other works to compare. The story line struck me as odd, however the author is skilled enough to make it believable. The characters have depth and the plot twists and bends so that you are quite surprised by the end of the book. All in all, not a bad read."
4,"Not Gold Coast, but...",Plum Island is not written with the depth of characters and story of Gold Coast but it is extremely entertaining and a good read.
3,Good read--too long.,"The MarginPlum Island is my first DeMille novel. The story is good, but much too much detail. Educational, yes, but tedius at times. I even went to sleep reading through the description of the facility. On the other hand, Conley is my kind of character--sarcastic and rude (when appropriate). I enjoyed his quips.I do prefer a faster pace, but otherwise would recommend this novel.Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin. A sophisticated mystery with unpredictable twists."
4,"Neat, twisty thriller","This book was recommended to me by a co-worker, who is coincidentally from New York. One of New York's finest, John Corey, is convalescing at his uncle's place on Long Island when his two neighbors (who are research biologists) are shot dead. Corey becomes involved when his friend Max offers him $1 to help with the case. The book is wordy but the dialogue is crisp and the twisty plot chugs along like a train. I would definitely seek out this author's other books."
3,It's okay,"I had already red The Lion and The Panther, and they were better written. It was good to see how the character came about."
3,PLUM ISLAND,"THIS BOOK IS OKAY, BUT I REALLY COULD NOT GET INTO. MAYBE YOU WILL LIKE IT. GIVE IT A TRY"
3,Not a bad read,"I can't say it's the best book I've ever read. Detective Corey is pretty cool and I like his attitude but the story line seems very ""manufactured"" even with the twists. It was as though characters were thrown in left, right, and centre to throw the reader off the plot. I think I liked the setting of the book and the accuracy of certain elements more than the story line. I just couldn't see how he deduced so quickly who the murderer was. The last half is the best part of the book. Overall, I'd prefer to see it as a movie."
3,Predictable but good,"While this book was very predictable it was still very entertaining. I didn't enjoy it as much as The Gold Coast but it is more of a DeMille style book. There is good suspense the book is very funny. I found myself laughing with the main character, John Corey, at his comments on other characters in the story. The story is very formulaic but there are couple twists that keep it interesting. It was very obvious to me early one what was being smuggled off the island but it was done pretty well."
3,A not too suspenseful thriller,"Plum Island's plot is quite convoluted and therefore interesting. However the unravelling of the mystery itself is a little bit predictable. Mr. DeMille attempts to add a fair number of twists and turns to the plot. Unfortunately, these unexpected changes hardly seem to throw the reader off for long. By the time the reader reaches the last chapter, he already knows too much... as does John Corey. For a guy who swigs that much beer and thinks mostly with a not so cerebral part of his anatomy, Corey's deductive skills are amazing, if not incredible. Also the narrative is clogged with too many trivial details.However Demille's unique blend of sometimes subtle and sometimes not so subtle sexuality as well as his action-packed sequences make for some entertaining reading. This is one book whose movie promises to be better."
2,Plum Island What a let down!!!,"I was hooked within the first 200 pages. I loved it. It was exciting it was believable. I was telling everyone about this book and was thrilled to find on a road atlas, Plum Island restricted area just like the book! But the twist in the story line killed it for me! Stolen treasure!!! be serious. It's like Mr. Demille left and another writer who obviously thought the story needed something finished it. Is this customary for Demille? I've purchased another one of his books and have not opened it for fear wasting my time. I like surprises, but pirate treasure? - from top secret government agencies, CIA, FBI, to pirate treasure? Perhaps I missed something."
4,Demille is the best....,"NELSON DEMILLE IS THE MOST ENTERTAINING WRITER TODAY. HIS STORIES ARE GRIPPING, ENTERTAINING, AND EDUCATIONAL. HE IS SIMPLY A GREAT WRITER. WHILE PLUM ISLAND WAS VERY GOOD, DEMILLE WILL ALWAYS BE MEASURED AGAINST WORD OF HONOR AND CHARM SCHOOL. BEING A LONG ISLAND NATIVE I LOVE NOVELS THAT HIT SO CLOSE TO HOME. PLUM ISLAND HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PLACE OF UNCERTAINTY, FEAR, AND MYSTERY TO ANYONE WHO HAS SEEN IT PASSING ON THE FERRY. DEMILLE ALSO WRITES SOME GREAT SEXUALLY CHARGED TENSION SCENES. THIS IS A WINNER."
3,Murder? Biological Warfare? Terrorism... NOT!,"If you think you are getting into a story about scientists, biological warfare, and world wide terrorism (as the cover leads for you to believe) get ready for a big disappointment. This book boils down to a murder story worthy of a ""USA Network Original Movie"". It's not bad and if you are one of those people who read a lot and enjoy a ""by the numbers"" murder mystery, then go for it. Corey is entertaining in a ""Fletch-wannabe"" way, but his act it like a Backstreet Boys single: Mildly entertaining for a while, then annoyingly over-played, then just excruciatingly painful. If this is Nelson's best work, I'll pass on his other efforts."
2,I wish I was always right,"Books where the main character always seems to know what's going on while other characters stand around clueless always irritate me. This is exactly one of those books.While the writing is good, and the storyline an interesting premise, Demille's characters are just too unbelievable. His main detective questions everything (and is always right) and everybody else kind of just takes a back seat.The villain is fleshed out nicely until the end where we get the cliche maniac, and the book is probably 75 pages too long.This is the first book I have read by this author and I can't say this title made me want to try another one."
1,Did I read a different PLUM ISLAND than everyone else ?,"Maybe I read a different version of PLUM ISLAND than everyone else, but I thought this was horrible. What happened to stories like The Charm School and The Gold Coast ? The first 200 pages kept my interest and then it was all down hill with a let down of an ending. Interested in a real good story like DeMille used to be ? Read Jon Land's THE WALLS OF JERICHO or David Morrell's EXTREME DENIAL...you won't be disappointed."
1,I don't get it.,My husband laughed out loud while reading this book. My friends recommended it. I found it a complete waste of time. I stuck with thinking it would get better but it didn't. I'm told I should give some of his earlier books a try. No thanks.
3,Plum Island,"Boozy detective on a heterosexual rampage along Long Island's normally quiet North Fork. Alcohol swilling detective John Corey uses his badge as a battering ram, commiting multiple felonies and misdemeanors in the pursuit of vengeance for homicide victims. Due process and the constitution are trashed as our testosterone-driven hero wreaks havoc on persons and property, punching, shooting, and disemboweling his way into your heart. Stereotypical bad guys include the sinister head of security at the Plum Island facility and a sniveling winemaker. Definitely not Demille's best effort, but it's still a hoot. Pick it up for some light summer reading."
1,"Too long, crude humor, sexist.",Most of the other reviewers touched on the same problems I had with the book. It was way too long for what it is. The humor is right out of middle school. Most of the humor is sexist.You should pass one this one.
1,Slowest Book Ever!!!!,It seems this book has taken me soooo long to read - it just never picks up speed. It's one of those books that never seems to grab your attention. Too much description - too many wise cracks - too much information about pirates. IT DRAGS ON FOREVER...
3,Visions of Nasty Plums,"This is my first taste of the critically lauded Nelson DeMille, and I have to admit I think he's a little over-rated. ""Plum Island"" is a thinking man's mystery, which is not negative in the long run. However, the pace is amazingly slow, and the lead character, John Corey, can sometimes be a little egotistical and arrogant. The case itself is an original idea, but there are no real surprises and the denouement seems forced and lethargic.Not a bad read, but nothing special."
1,Piece of cheese.,"This so called novel isn't even good enough to be received as a gift. Bad pun after bad pun, bad characters, bad everywhere.But apparently well enough to be published.Somehow!"
1,Extremely dissatisfied!,"Ordered a new book; received an obviously used book, with no dust cover and worn hard cover. Wrote to the seller, never received an answer. If I had wanted a used book, it would have cost 4 or 5 dollars. Paid twenty-five; will never use Amazon again."
2,Should have remained buried...along with the treasure,"You should stop reading this book after about Chapter 5. It starts with the introduction of a potentially great character in Detective John Corey, and an exciting scenario for a mystery. But DeMille cannot sustain the plot or the character, and from then on it limps its way to a dreary and inevitable conclusion.Reading DeMille is a hit or miss affair, and it certainly fun trying to guess what he is going write about next. Sometimes it works: General's Daughter, Gold Coast and Cathedral are all very different, but all work. Plum Island is a great disppoiontment."
2,Plum Island ... plum rotten,"Wait for the movie. Missing deadly viruses, natural disasters, car chases - it will all work better on the big screen. Bruce Willis will probably have the starring role (a la Die Hard).The most likeable characters in this book are the couple dead before page one. Do you really want to keep reading?"
5,Plum is a plum of a book,Plum is a great read. I love smartass cops and John Corey never stops. I will likely read other of his books.
5,"Great plot. good, tragic love story. EXELENT sea chase in a hurricane. LOVED IT.","5 starsIt is a great example of a page turner. I hated to put it down, but I did have to work."
1,Really bad.,"This is the first and last book I will read by this author. Everyone was raving about the book so I decided to read it. The detective, who I thought was not the least bit funny, was so annoying that if he were a real person I would probably kill him. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,How could a book this bad be published?,"John Cory is a macho, sex obsessed, obnoxious, smart alec, disgusting cop. He's also a case of arrested development, with the mind of a high school sophomore who spent most of his time in the bathroom. In between making insulting or boorish comments to, or about, everyone he meets, There are pages and pages of drivel; pointless conversations or observations on nothing anyone would want to waste time with. I don't know how the book ends. I don't even care; it ended for me when I cheerfully tossed it into the recycle bin."
2,broken reality,"Fiction is a remarkable phenomenon. It begins as anunread sequence of words, the whimsical constructionof the author's mind. But as the pages pass, the realitygels, the events become meaningful, the author disappears.But sometimes work strains the suspension of disbelief to thebreaking point. The veil of reality disappears, and one isagain left with words... words of the author's design,the events they describe without importance or causal connection.This is what happens with Plum Island.It isn't a total loss. Some of the character interactions,through most of the book, are compelling, and the descriptionof the local culture sustains interest. But the end-gameis where it falters. Drama surrenders to silliness. The readeris betrayed.I haven't ready anything else from Demille, and probablywon't. I instead recommend Robert E. Parker's Spenser series(I recommend starting from the beginning) as superiorin virtually all aspects -- it's a far better executionof the same style."
3,Not that great.,The detective's character and sense of humor got a bit tiresome after a while. The story wasn't that good either so I have no idea why there were rave reviews.
5,A Treasure!,"This book made me laugh hard and even made me sad at one point. It gave a nice history of Eastern LI as well. Its treasure hunting twist made the story very exciting because of the way it was juxtaposed against the animal disease background (two completely different motives). The ending with the speed boats was overdone for a novel, but I really enjoyed it anyway and could easily see it fitting well in Hollywood."
4,"A fast, snappy read, with wit and charm.","Overall a fine story with fast pace, interesting characters and lots of laughs along the way. Which makes it one of my favorites."
2,Read C School and Gen Daughter before thinking of Plum Isld!,"What a let down after Charm School and General's Daughter. Characters forgotten and not to mention plot forgotten, I was left wondering where or what happened to 3 or 4 characters.This was definitely a weak effort."
2,Demille is running out of steam,Following the fantastic The Generals Daughter and The Charm School this book is a big bust. The main detective is annoying with his wise guy attitude and the finale is totally unbelievable. A good one to skip.
2,Predictable,"This book was a disapointment. I just read ""Mayday"" which was exciting and terrifying. But this? I liked the jargong of the antihero. But why has always, always, the girl/woman who are sexually free - have to die? And why does the hero always have to end up with the ""good cop"". This book is filled with good dialouge and good craftmanship. But the sexual frustration and predictable social storyline let the whole concept down to only two stars."
2,Stupid Cop or Inadequate Vigilante?,"The main character in this book is a horribly sexist homicide detective who in the real world would have been drummed out (and probably jailed) for blatant disregard for the constitution. All female characters are ""hot."" The plot is as thin and contrived as the action scenes. Nothing to recommend here."
5,One of my fav's,"This guy is a master story teller. I love his John Corey character. Great sense of humor too! I love the fact that this character is such a horn dog, loves women but there is no raunchiness."
3,never read any DeMille previously,"TOOO much repetition on material. Seemed to be trying hard to be ""blue"" and failed . It was more like a middle schooler trying to learn to use sexual inuendo.He seemed to repeat and repeat the details.Both women were written as if thy only had a brain in their heads if they agreed with him,otherwise his character was olny interested in what his glands told him.He also does not have very skilled grammer editor./"
5,Master,"I really like DeMille books, and John Corey seems to be the friend I wish I would have. He is clever, sarcastic and funny. This book as others Demille's is very good."
4,Thrilling and lol funny,"I liked the pace of the book, the unexpected dry humor. It fell short of the 5th star due to overly drawn out ending."
5,"Try it ,you will love it!","Plum Island has something for every reader. Great plot,lots of action.You name it it's in there.You will hate for the story to end."
4,Just Plum Good Read!,"Very enjoyable, good plot, fine characters, and good humor mixed in to a good mystery. I like the style of Nelson DeMille's writing, good plot development, likable detective in John Corey and it moves right along."
4,"Plum Island ""John Corey"" review",a good story and plot. i really enjoy the the quirky commentary. John Corey is an excellent character and I look forward to reading all the books in the series. Nelson DeMille keeps the plot moving and is a terrific author.
1,"The main character gets very tiresome, and the plot wanders.","Having reading two other of the author's books, I looked forward to a plot that developed with some imagination and reality. The ailing main character, should have stayed in NYC and let the female detective do the intelligent work. The dialogue by John Corey soon wore thin, and not much humor was left after the first third of the book"
