4,Thoroughly entertaining and thought-provoking.,"When Jack Cantrell returns to his home in Lincolnshire after 10 years in the Caribbean, it spells trouble for all concerned. Jack must leave his beloved mistress, and his brother's death has left him with the title of earl, a decrepit manor, and a family in shambles. When Jack first meets his brother's ex-fiance, he can't figure out how his nasty brother wound up engaged to a bishop's daughter. But there are plenty of surprises in store for him as he works to undo the damage his brother has done, to Priscilla Wilcox and to the family.I thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining story. My favorite thing about the book was how Priscilla ""came into her own"" as the story progressed, and it was refreshing to read about a heroine who was average-looking, rather than beautiful--it's easier for the typical woman to relate to. I also liked that fact that Hingston brings some controversial issues into play. Keep up the good work, Ms. Hingston!"
2,Pain in the rear to install,"In order to mount this HSF to a motherboard correctly, you must first remove the fan, and then the fan mount. only then can you access the mounting clips for the heatsink.while it works acceptably well, I wouldn't buy another."
2,It is indeed frustrating to install,"As a previous reviewer said, you need to remove the fan to install it right. I did not believe first and struggled to do the ""easy"" way. After 15 minutes of frustration, I finally removed the fan and it was secured in 60 seconds."
1,There has to be a better CPU fan,"Thermaltake was a brand I held in high esteem. So when it came to buying a CPU fan for my computer, I did not think twice about purchasing the TR2 M21. Well the first one I purchased lasted about 8 months. Then the fan seized over the weekend and I found myself looking for another fan locally. The selection around town was less than desirable. It was either buy another TR2 M21 or spend $80+. (Hindsight is always 20/20) But I went against my better judgment and purchased another TR2. That was only 5 months ago. Now I am in the market for yet another CPU fan, as my current TR2 suffered the same fate as the first.It is possible Thermaltake's higher end equipment is better quality. However from my experience, I would strong discourage anyone from purchasing this CPU fan."
3,"Looks okay, doesn't fit?","I have two P4 machines, socket 775 and one Celeron D machine, same socket. When I needed a new cooler for one of my P4 machines I took the one from the Celeron and attached it so the P4 could keep running imeadiately.I then ordered this one for the celeron, and it doesn't fit, not even close.The copper is round, meaning that on either my P4 or Celeron machines only about 80% of the square proccessor surface area would be in direct contact.Also, the Unit is square, all three of my socket 775 machines require rectangular mounting.I don't know what this fits, but of my three socket 775 mother boards, none of the above."
1,UGH!,I bought one for a new pc I was assembling and it worked well for a year. It then started vibrating and making noise like the case would come apart. Thought maybe I'd gotten a lemon and bought another of the same type. It lasted about two months before the bearings started going out and vibrating once again! Does this thing have plastic bushings? Junk!!!
4,Won't fit in smaller cases. May get noisy.,"I bought this cooler to replace the stock Intel cooler that came with my Pentium 4 CPU. I wanted a quieter fan, and I knew Thermaltake makes quiet fans. I also one that would fit in a Micro-ATX case I was using; however, this fan didn't fit in that case. The 3 arms on top of the fan made it too tall, and the case's power supply was in the way. Luckily, I had a spare PC case that wasn't being used, so I moved everything into that case so it would fit (yes, I consider a quiet fan that important).I have this fan in a computer that's running all the time. After only a few months, the fan started getting loud sometimes. And it so happens that it often gets loud at night when I'm just getting into bed to sleep. It might just be the particular one I bought, but I might look around for a different one."
2,Overpriced shipping,"$4 product, listing indicated multiple items, not 1 unit, and shipping came in over $15."
2,Standard vacuous '80s love story.,"Meg Foster plays a 30-something photographer/artist. Douglas Greenall is a 19 year old adrenaline junkie who races motorcycles. They fall in love and encounter the usual relationship problems. The only thing that saves this film from being a total waste is the appealing nature of the two leads. Other than that, however, this is strictly an unremarkable love story which has been told countless times before."
1,Not a SharePoint 2007 Book,"Amazon lists the date for this book May 4, 2009 and this might make you think it covers 2007 version. This book was published in 2005 and I have no idea where Amazon gets that 2009 date from.If you looking for a 2007 book check Scot's other book: WSS and MOSS 3.0 Development (Video Training): 10 Solutions Every SharePoint Developer Should Know How to Create (LiveLessons)"
5,This is an exceptional Electrical Device!,This product is a great tool for installing a separate electrical power source in a garage or work room. You can turn the power off at this box and not affect the power source in your home. It was easy to install. It is small and compact-not taking up much space on the wall.I would absolutely recommend this! We had a new garage remote door installed and were able to shut power off at this box and not affect power anywhere else. It's great!!!
1,avoid...,"well vaughan's work is a double threat it is true:1. the value for reading the words and looking at the pictures is 0/5 stars.2. the value for using these pages to catch waste from birds in cages, or to be used as cheap tp...1/5 due to the less-than-optimal paper."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The complete lack of information and accountability about the Culper Ring comes back to haunt Yorick here. Agent 355 thinks Yorick's mental state is not what it could be, so she sends him to Agent 711, for a bit of programming or reprogramming, depending on how you look at it. There is less of the yelling and more of the drugs and sex in her methodology."
4,Story keeps moving forward,"Y: The Last Man is simply one of the best regular books out today and comes highly recommended. The gist is great: Something kills every last male on the planet. Humans, animals, all of them. Except for this one guy and his monkey. Cue post-apocalypse, Standish troubles. Chaos ensues, governments fall, militant women go nuts, doomsday religions pop up, and on and on and on. It's a nice twist on a done-to-death (no pun intended) concept, this time in comic form.This installment, Safeword, is a little weak in its first half (though it does contain some nice revelations about the title character), but plunges into a very good second half that again pushes the main story forward. This story arc did not leave me floored like the last arc did, but it certainly had me eager to continue with this great series. The art is a little vanilla, but the story is great.Recommended reading. HIGHLY recommended."
5,The best collection yet!,"""Safeword"" (the first three issues in this volume) is by far the best story arc in the entire series so far. Seeing Yorick deal with his survivor's guilt was some of the most inspired character development I've seen in recent comics. The second story arc, ""Widow's Pass"", was also a treat. Not only do I recommend this volume, but I urge you to read the rest of the series as well!"
5,Real Wood!,I've been looking for a table that was real wood and not have a veneer finish. This piece was perfect! The price was right too!
3,Great furniture but...,"I received 2 of these end tables for Christmas as well as the coffee table. All three products went together very easily which was a major bonus. The two end tables were put together on seperate nights. Upon putting them side-by-side in a pile of things to be put in my car to take back to my apartment, we realized the problem: one end table is approximately 2 inches shorter than the other! Both had the same dimensions on the outside of the box, but one was much shorter than the dimensions claimed. If you are buying more than one, be wary!"
4,Tables,Purchased the mission style end tables and coffee table for a medical office and they are great - Our patients comment everyday about how beautiful our new office is
4,Very cute table,"I just ordered this table. It matches perfectly with my couch and the coffee table. It is easy to put together and I'm not good with tools and screwdrivers at all. The holes are a little bit small and I chipped it a tiny bit (that's why I gave 4 stars) but I'm okay with that since I can't see the little defect. It's sturdy but not too strong. In my opinion, it is a great accent piece. I've placed a plant over it and looks quite nice."
4,End Table,"This item was just what I wanted. It's sturdy, easy to put together and seems very durable. I really enjoy the look and the shelf on the bottom. I was looking for an affordable light colored wood table."
4,Mission end table,I love the mission end tables I ordered. They are a great value and look great in my den. The quality is very impressive and better than I expected them to be.
4,Great Looking Set,"I recently purchased the Mission End Table, Mission Coffee Table and the Mission Hall Table. I am very pleased with all three of these pieces. The construction was fairly easy (for my husband!) and they are all very study. They look wonderful together. I would highly recommend these pieces to anyone looking for a casual set."
4,"I Like It, I Love It...","I read the mixed reviews but I really liked the design so I ordered this coffee table and two of the matching end tables. I had all three pieces put together in an hour and a half. It was the easiest furniture assembly I've ever done. I don't know why anyone thinks they are wobbly or ""unsturdy"" as I found that when put together according to the directions, they are neither. My only complaint is that I think the silver screws are too soft and the heads easily stripped, but I'm flexible and I got around that."
5,A great table for your mini-fridge or TV console,"It takes a bit of time to assemble the six pieces, but with patient,careful work one person can do the whole job alone. The only tool youneed is a philips screwdriver. The wood from Vietnam is superb."
5,always pleased with Target,"I puchased another Mission table (different size) years ago andnow adding the end table to match. These are good quality ata very reasonable price. I know I will be pleased even before my purchase arrives, because Target is all about having qualityas well as reasonable pricing."
4,Easy to Assemble,"I bought this table because it looks sturdy, functional and matches my other furniture. However, there were no screws or directions with this piece. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to obtain the missing pieces and directions. Fortunately, the assembly looks like it will be very easy once I get the missing pieces. I'm sure I'll be very happy with this table once I get it assembled."
1,"Very low quality, look elsewhere","My mom bought two of these and I put them together, or at least tried to. It was more frustrating than it should have been because many of the bolts did not fit cleanly. On one of them two of the screws snapped in half. On the other the top shelf snapped in two with almost no pressure being applied. I was planning on using that one for my new tv, luckily I never got the chance.I don't usually shop at Target, but I was under the assumption that their quality was decent. Not a good value."
4,Founding of America,A well done documentary done by a always good History Channel. It gives you a general view ofthe founding of our nation.
3,Could be better,"I am a big fan of the Weichuan cookbook series (maybe because my mom based her cooking on them when I was growing up) but was a little disappointed by this one. I was not expecting such a large section about dishes served over rice, but rather more recipes using rice and noodles as a central ingredient. Having said that, a lot of the staples are in here so it still serves a handy reference manual (I tend to improvise and add more ingredients than suggested, using the recipes in this book just as a general guide)."
3,A little disappointed,"I thought there would be a lot more noodle dishes in here, but it seems to be mostly rice. The dishes I have made so far came out OK, but not great."
2,fair,"This book is okay for an individual who can read asian. Many recipes are written in english as well as asian. The book is an older publication, not up to date with ingredients we now have available at local oriental markets."
5,Nobody does it better,"Dennis Lee is a treasure. My daughter and I devoured Alligator Pie when she was a little girl, chuckling merrily over author Lee's zany humor and vivid imagery. I have subsequently given each new Lee book to the children (and even some of the adults) I know, happy to introduce this outstanding author to those who haven't yet discovered him. Want to make your children/grandchildren/neighborhood kids laugh out loud? Get them anything Dennis Lee has written. He's truly gifted, truly tapped into the mind of the child in all of us.My highest recommendation."
3,Worth the Price?,"I haven't read this book. My comment is on the first review--last line. ""Worth the price""? It's 600 DOLLARS (+/-). I love books and know that collectibles can run into the $millions. Surely, this is a fine book, but just maybe a work-a-day letterpress printer can find a more economical guide!"
2,Low quality,"This review is, of course, for the publishing and other aspects of the book. Poe's work stands for itself.I had two complaints, and felt they were sufficient to justify returning the book. The paper is thin, of low quality, and the binding also seems weak. The illustrations are terrible. There may be a few that are good, but not of the dozen or so I looked carefully at. As a class, they are amateurish and meaninglessly caricaturized so that they add nothing to the story. In one case, the picture revealed information that had not yet been made clear in the story, but was only found after turning the illustration over (The Oblong Box, and the fact of the box's contents).Perhaps for the price this should have been expected, but it stands."
2,Love Poe This Edition Is Bad,Poe is always a great read. The content is good when you can find it. Horrible Table of Contents and will ask Amazon for refund. Read Poe but maybe go for a different version. TOC needs lots of work. While a buck 99 isn't much for a PD book would be nice to locate what you are looking for.
4,Good Transition to E-Book Format,"Poe's works are a formidable challenge, and I admit I've read less than 20 percent of the total (it may be a lifetime project). Accordingly, I'll limit my remarks to the Kindle translation.Overall the editors did an effective job of translating the book to E-book format. The organization is logical, and the reader can easily move from the text to the contents when coming to a passage he or she wishes to skip. Poe's vocabulary can be daunting, and having quick access to the built-in dictionary is an invaluable feature. Recommended to any Poe fan for whom the world seems a bit more orderly with constant access to these works."
2,"Great content, awful Kindle edition","Thanks to Amazon's generous refund policy I have just returned this book, because this edition (Delphi Classics) is unusable on Kindle. It is unusable for one reason: the book has no chapters. This means you you cannot navigate directly to the next / previous poem or story. If you're reading one story and want to skip to the next, you have two options:- click the Next Page button as many times as it takes, or- go to the ToC, navigate to the collection you've been reading, then find the ToC for this collection and click the link to the story there.All this instead of a single press on the 4-way button on my Kindle Classic. I hope there is a better formatted edition out there somewhere."
3,Kindle edition with chopped text,"I'm reviewing the publishing and the formatting. I'm not sure if this is a problem with the delivery system, the kindle program on my tablet, or if it's a problem with the text, but I'm consistently getting chopped text.A paragraph will end, and then it will jump to the middle of a paragraph. It totally ruins the reading experience for me.Poe rocks, though."
2,Not a good keychain connection,"I had this product for about 3 months and I noticed that as I started using it, the connection between the cap that connects to my keychain and the actual drive began to get looser and looser, until one day I looked down at my keys and there was no drive. Just a little cap connected to my keys.Needless to say, If you want to keep your information on your keychain, then this product is not for you. Find a flash drive that has its connection to the keychain on the body of the drive.. not the cap."
5,great costume,"My son loves this costume,And unlike other costumes, this ones quality is realy good.My son wore the costume for two days in the purim holyday and was very happy!!I recommend it to everyone who want to have a superman costume that combins fair price and good quality."
2,Warhammer 40k,"This gift was purchased for my son who would tell you it's a great gift. For the money the items are very tiny , making them difficult to paint and the paint to finish them expensive. The need for multiple sets to play the game isn't worth it as it's not very popular in the states. With that being said he thinks they're wonderful and worth the work."
1,not good quality,we burned through them all after a couple of uses--be sure they are the right size--one size does not fit all on the Hoover Windtunnels!
3,In Agreement With Everyone,This belt should be purchased in bulk; IT does what it is supposed to do. Did you realize you would replace it every 6 months when you bought your Hoover? The Hoover WindTunnel does not support the former reputation of the company. I will never buy another Hoover product; not worth the money from Day One.
5,Enlightening,"This video is one of the most enlightening films you can buy. The information is out there-available for anyone to find-but Alex compiles it into one neat package that will knock your socks off.Once we face the truth, then hopefully we will begin to act.Another thing I'd recommend is to visit prisonplanet on the web."
1,Too Conspiracy-Theorish,"I was hoping for this documentary to be critical of the widely disseminated perspectives on 9/11, but it was too dramatic to take seriously. From the conspiratorial voice of the narrator to the ridiculous argument that the killing of a drunk led to World War I (a claim that is just as absurd as the killing of the Archduke leading to World War I), the film was neither informative nor entertaining."
3,"Very good, but incomplete...","Alex Jones, the ex-Scientologist has gone'straight' - or has he? Since 1997 Alexhas pumped out one VHS or DVD tape afteranother and the 'goyim' have gobbled themup like candy. Like half-baked Dave Icke,he seems to know what he is talking aboutbut since Alex wife, Violette 'Nichols'isa khazar (so-called'jew') and her fatherwas a former US diplomat, maybe that ex-plains why good old Alex, who was some-what offbase on Bohemian Grove (see TomValentine or call him at 1-800-522-4279),always tries to cover up the Zionist con-nection on all things New World Odor (seealso Bo Gritz book, ""My Brother's Keep-er."") No, I think I'll stick to the 9/11film of Eric Hufshmid or reports by ChrisBollyn for future reports on the 'terror-state'. But this IS the best Al has doneto date. Proceed with caution! Revision-ist Rich Salzer, Ches., VA, USA."
1,Horrible Propaganda,"I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to see what real propaganda looks like. Too many ""facts"" are not able to be verified. There are too many ""facts"" spit out at one time that you feel bombarded. It was so preposturous that I couldn't watch the whole film. This is NOT a true documentary but a definate propaganda film. If there were an opportunity for me to give this ""0 stars"" I would have!!"
1,Save your money!,Don't bother with this DVD. I'm not a neo-con. But this DVD is a waste of time. Better off doing your own research. Read a book!
3,Firestorm Jones,"Jones makes some very worthwhile points, not the least of which is that terror is as much a matter of perspective as definition, especially in light of some of the U.S. government's actions that could be accurately and fairly labeled as ""terrorism"" (which Jones does a decent job of summarizing).Here, Jones doesn't quibble with the fact that 9/11 was an act of terrorism, but with who the guilty parties are. The numerous discrepancies presented (along with many that are not), are certainly worthy of further scrutiny. And it is amazing (inexcusable and probably criminal, actually) that more media investigative attention has not be given to such a major event and the litany of unanswered questions associated with it.I disagree with Jones' condemnation of government as the evil responsible for 9/11. Rather, the focus should be on the individual criminals responsible, instead of the institution they exploited, or circumvented, or victimized, to perpetrate their crime."
5,Well done!,"I have seen the video for free on the web, and now I have finally ordered it so that I may distribute it around to friends/family. My main goal here is to raise people's awareness (like Alex and Paul do) by informing them with evidence that: 1) We are not as FREE as we think we are 2) Don't settle for the status quo definition of what freedom is 3) Do you want your children to grow up in this environment of shrinking freedom?As Alex and Paul would say: Wake up, and don't fall for the phony left/right paradigm! That way of thinking is meant to divide and conquer, to distract us~ Thank you."
5,KNOW THE TRUTH!!!,"as soon as you start watching the video you will find a different type of documentary from alex jones who had previously done many films about government terrorism.this is the best! hard facts! and cant say no to it,after watching it your life would change because if you were in the shadows of misinformation this truth will open your mind to a better knowledge of the people who rule you.wake up humanity!-manuel,fl"
5,Amazing....,One of Alex Jones best documentaries and thats saying a lot. If you want a taste of the truth watch this video but beware for it will unlock a door that you will not be able to close. Remember ignorance is bliss...
1,Less than I expected,Terrorstorm - A History of Government Sponsored TerrorismThis video was horrible. It made things up along the way and made connections where there were none. I was very embarrased to have purchase this dvd and currently am going to put it up for sale for a few pennies. It was very bad.
1,One of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen.,"This is an absolutely preposterous video. The whole video is like a propaganda film that has wild ideas thrown in with some defrocked government interviews and sketchy statistics. It is so incredibly ridiculous that it is almost beyond argumentation. If the people who adhere to these wild conspiracy theories would view their own material as critically as they view the information from society, these films would never be even considered. If 99% of society says your ideas are crazy - they probably are."
5,THIS IS THE MOVIE TO CHANGE YOU ABOUT GOVERNMENTS,If you like to think on your own terms without mainstream media telling you what you should think or belive well this is the movie for you without a doubt. You will be thinking out of your box of the prapragana of mainstream and will look at what really is real and what isn't real. Terrorstorm will change you how you look at governments once and for all. It us the people that the government should be scard of not the people scard of the government. Right now years apon history will look at this and its US to make it through everything standing up to what the usa is really about. Buy Terrorstorm it will expand everything you disbelieve before.
3,Historical Context of 911 Makes the Point,"We've all heard the claims that 911 was an inside job. The film brings together the historical reports, previously confirmed false flag operations, successfully implemented but deceptive propaganda techniques to achieve a desired end, motivations for an Iraq invasion suggested in intelligence reports, and other supporting evidence. Viewers are left with little doubt that the American public has not been told the truth. Although the film is repetitive, loud, and sensationally presented, it is convincing. You will be disappointed and disgusted and hopefully outraged."
5,One of Alex's best...,"Alex Jones has produced some of the greatest conspiracy videos of the genre. Hardcore conspircay fans have been following him since his Police State 2000, when he was prophesizing our current state of affairs, with Clinton as his bullseye...""TerrorStorm"" is one of his best... Alex actually eases off of his typical ""excitment"" and does a good job of presenting factual information without offputting the viewer. His other works could be unpalatable to the average viewer and golden to his hardcore fans.""TerrorStorm"" rationally and calmly sorts through the information without bashing you over the head with it, like his other videos do. The man is motivated and an inspiration to many.Watch the film, share it with others. Spread the word."
4,A great X-Mas Gift for the uninformed...,"Terrorstorm is the latest Alex Jones documentary, examining his favorite subject: State sponsored terrorism. Americans really need to watch this film for obvious reasons. Its a detailed analysis of methods governments use to scare the populace into following the ""party line"", whatever the party line is at the moment.The greatest benefit of this film is to give people information so they can stop being afraid of terrorist boogeymen.Well worth your money..."
1,Alex Jones sucks!,"I bought and watched `Terrorstorm' and to be honest I didn't think it was very good. It was poorly edited; there were scenes that went on for just too long (I.E. interviews). Plus, the Doc. seems to be more about Alex Jones, then the message he's trying to get across. After watching `Terrorstorm' I get the impression that Mr. Jones is nothing more than a trouble making egomaniac with some major issues. Makes me wonder if even half the stuff he reports on is even true, or just fabrications."
2,Not Good...,"I watched the whole thing and I didn't laugh once! The plot was ridiculous, the acting was terrible and the special effects looked like something out of 1986.I'm surprized the Bush administration agreed to put their good name on this - if anything, they came out of it looking bad...Why buy Terrorstorm when you can buy ""Scream"" starring the lovely Neve Campbell for the same price?Verdict:come on Hollywood, give the people what they want!"
1,Oh no not again.,"""TERRORSTORM sets a new standard in documentary filmmaking.""Well this comment, from Dylan Avery (failed film student and creator of the awful ""Loose Change"" series), is true anyway. There are few example of such atrocious drivel previously in the documentary genre.It's a combination of many of Jones's pet conspiracy theories (false-flag terrorism, the NWO et cetera) jammed together into an inchoerent (and contradictory) mess.Give this rubbish a miss."
4,Great info,"These are important dvd's. More important is ENDGAME. If you are into great independant films and love your country, get them all."
5,Terrorstorm Rocks You Like a Hurricane,"Alex Jones rips through history like a hurricane, siting examples of state sponsored terror and how governments use deceptive military tactics on their own people to garner support for war and occupation.The film is packed with information. I find the bull horning sessions amusing.Counter Terrorism Tzar Richard Clark stated that ""your government failed you on 9-11"". After watching Terrorstorm you realize ""your government killed you on 9-11""."
5,Packed with alot of information,"I have watched this three times trying to absorb it all, and will need to at least once more. Very worth watching- both entertaining & makes you think."
5,Watch this and hopefully you might wake up before it is too late!,"What's the difference between a `Conspiracy Theory' and a `Conspiracy'? A `Conspiracy Theory' is just that, a theory with no real concrete facts or evidence. A `Conspiracy' is very, very different. It has solid facts and evidence to support it. Learn from this DVD that 7/7, 911 and many other `state sponsored' terror attacks are just that - `Conspiracies' not `Conspiracy Theories.'Watch this and hopefully you might wake up before it is too late!"
5,the powerful truth,"Excellent film.A great eye opener to the ignorant or uneducated sheeple who still believe the mainstream media.Please watch,take notes,and do your own research.Join us in the fight against the new world order."
5,"The truth will set you free - but first, it will piss you off!","Many people are waking up to the truth that there is something wrong with what we are being told with regards to the ""War On Terror"", which might as well be called the War On Terriers. Alex Jones has been on the case for many years now, exposing the plans of the Globalist Agenda. Terrorism is a phantom that has been created and supported by governments throughout the world to stir up fears within the people so that they will react emotionally, instead of rationally. If you like scary movies this one is even scarier than the worst fake horror movie, because this one is real folks! This movie is based in facts that have been documented and are part of the historical record. It is professionally done and needs to be seen by anyone who is ready to be deprogammed from the War On Terror Death Cult."
5,What we don't know CAN hurt us,"This video touches on declassified ""false flag"" operations, including the CIA orchestrated coup in Iran (Operation Ajax) and the even deadlier ""Operation Gladio."" Also covered: The USS Liberty attack, the (manufactured) Golf of Tonkin incident, the 1976 bombing of flight 455, and Adolph Hitler's' use of false flag operations to secure absolute power. This documentary reminds us why our founding fathers were so adamant about limiting government power / secrecy. ...That few in America have even heard of these events reveals the danger of trusting our ""mainstream media"" to keep us informed."
5,Please Everyone Watch This Film,"This is a must see film. This documentary allows the viewer to see things that the American news industry is withholding from the American public. The concept of a ""False Flag"" campaign should be taught in our schools and to every American today. A well executed ""False Flag"" campaign threatens the freedom of every man, woman, and mostly the children. Please watch this film."
4,look for truth,"A very good eye opener,needs more of the panel discussion 911 for truth.But I still felt good about this,it feels very real,thank you Alex Jones, you are a fine human Being."
3,Excellent Resource,"A very well done film. My compliments and praise to AJ and the rest of the InfoWars crew. In my opinion, however, the film attempts to cover what seems like almost too much material; I would recommend focusing on one specific event, as is more typical of AJ's efforts and InfoWars' productions. The sheer scope of events that the film presents is almost confusing at times, and I feel it might upset the attention span of most ""uninformed"" individuals. Other than that, I recommend this film to everyone, and I shamelessly plug InfoWars' other productions, especially ""Martial Law."" Definately combine this material with other sources, as no one single person has the right answer. ""A thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it."" -Oscar Wilde"
5,TERRORSTORM,"Alex Jones is a man on a mission. His mission is to uncover the corruption and tyranny of the major governmnets on this planet... and he does it very well! This DVD will chronical the history of government sponsored terrorism. Over the last 100 years, governments have used terrorism to their advantage as much, if not more, than they do today. This new version includes a great interview with Jesse Ventura in regards to oporation Northwoods, The Gulf of Tonkin, and 9/11. This is a must see for anyone who wants to know how things really happen in the world. There is no cherry on top, no mainstream media distortion; only real and in your face facts about government sponsored terrorism.A+"
5,Great Expose on False Flag Terrorism,"Governments kill their own people to blame it on an enemy and get what they want.It's called ""problem-reaction-solution""Alex Jones, using only a handful of examples (otherwise the film would be 100 hours long), proves that it is a historical fact that governments are behind most of the big sensationalist terrorist events of the 20th century.Also see: ""Endgame: Blueprint for Global Enslavement"""
5,Traditional Willow Blue Sugar Bowl,"This Johnson Brothers Willow Blue Dinnerware Covered Sugar Bowl is the traditional-shaped one, as compared to the covered pagoda 3-D sugar bowl. A matching creamer in the traditional shape is also available in this pretty blue and white porcelain pattern. That is the fun of ""choosing"" your ""open stock"" china pattern--you can pick the design that suits you, your decor, and your mood."
4,works well for specials needs students,I bought these cards and the pen and find that they work well for special needs students. They find the sounds from the pen reinforcing and I feel like they stay with the activity longer.
5,great new series,"100 Bullets is a great new series, though I've read the books not included here, and I think it might have been better as a mini-series. Nice artwork, interesting and original storyline, though not one that coudl be continued indefinitely. Still, good stuff, if only the first volume. Legendary."
4,Great premise,"Great premise for a series--a stranger shows up and presents a gun and 100 untraceable bullets to a person with a grudge. It's a license to kill, and the fun is in watching how the recipients handle their gift. Reminds me of the old 1950s TV show ""The Millionaire"" in which the mysterious Mr. Anthony gave out $1 million checks to average Joes. The artwork in FIRST SHOT, LAST CALL puts you right there--you can feel the grime of the barrio, smell the smoke and stale beer at the bar. I felt that the first story (Dizzy) was better than the second (Lee), but they both had the requisite grit and nasty to be quality noir. I'll be picking up other books in the series."
2,Doesn't have the punch I was expecting,"Having read ""The Sandman"", and being almost through with ""The Preacher"" series, I decided to branch out and try another extended tale. But for some reason, the first volume just left me saying ""meh."" The art was ok, but the story wasn't meaty enough to really grab me.I suggest buying the first volume and checking it out for yourself BEFORE you buy any more. If it works for you, great - but it didn't work for me. So I guess what I'm really saying is to dip your foot in the water before you dive in."
5,The Best Series Out There,"This is the beginning volume of a series that just blows your mind. The story is more of a crime novel than a classic comic or graphic novel but maintains all the qualities of the latter. The art is outstanding;I got a lot of great tattoo ideas from these books as well. Characters developemnt is very good and new characters continue to be introduced. There are characters from all walks of life. You never know who to route for or who the good guys and bad guys really are and the story never competely unfolds. I am eagerly awaiting volume 11 to come out. Wheher this is your first graphic novel or you are an old pro, pick this one up."
2,Not exactly what I thought it would be,"I had this recommended to me and the premise of the story is quite appealing. The execution and the characters were less than appealing though. My first gripe is that I absolutley can't stand the characters. They're all hood rats and there's plenty of ""knowumsayin'"" in the text bubbles. I can't stand the ghetto, hip-hop speak and that alone made me not to want to read this again. The art is so-so. I've seen better. I found myself rooting for the bad guys so I wouldn't have to read another, ""knowumsayin'"" or ""homey this, homey that"" UGGGHHH!"
1,Reads like an episode of Scooby Doo,"I thought the whole point of a comic was watching a story unfold, someone should tell this author. It was 3 stories filled with stereotypical characters saying and doing nothing of importance until a character at the end gives a ton of ridiculous and unbelievable exposition in an attempt to make sense of the stupidity. MOST OVER RATED COMIC EVER."
2,Could be more upbeat.,"Being a member of the Church of the Living God, I know this music. Mr Treadway, is a good musician, without question. But I fail to see why the music played during the church services were not incorporated in this CD. He could have played the improvised tunes so familiar to the Church as well as the well known songs. That is one important thing lacking in this CD."
3,"A great start, but the middle is weak","Newbies to C# will very much appreciate the first 5 chapters, as they cover both C# essentials plus a very nice review of OOP. Some other reviewer jokingly compared this book to the writing of Immanual Kant. If he was referring to this first section, I heartily agree.However, prospective buyers should read the scathing treatment of another reviewer here of the subsequent chapters on GUI/Windows application programming. These middle chapters really fall short, with missing or misleading steps in writing the test application, what to do if one does not have the MSMAPI ocx component loaded on his computer (necessary for completing one of the chapters). Twice I could not finish the chapter.The first 5 chapters deserve 6 stars. Now I have to find another book on C# to help me through the rough patches in this one."
5,Great Puzzle,It is so hard to find nice puzzles lately. This one is great! Big nice colorful pieces that are wood and teach your child shapes! My six year old daughter loves it! Thanks for making such a high quality puzzle!
3,"Good, but cheaply done","Great concept, but I was disappointed to find that the shapes are plain wood with colored paper on just the front, rather than painted wood all the way around. One or two mouthings and the paper started wearing off within the first day! I generally really like M&D products, so was sorry this one wasn't more durable. I'll probably only buy these in stores in the future where I can examine the quality more easily before I buy."
1,Cheap; paper covering rubs off,My grandson loved these blocks but when they got sticky I wiped them with a damp cloth and the paper started rubbing off. I thought they were painted and would be more durable. Any child's toy should be sturdy enough to wipe clean.
2,Falls apart,"My daughter loves shapes and has mastered a few puzzles already at her age. She loved this toy when we got it but within a few hours the wood started to chip. Since all kids throw their stuff around, this is not a good toy to have about. The shapes are made of a cheap looking composite and even at the smallest drop on my carpet, the wood chips. I spent another hour just trying to pick off the wood bits from my carpet.The next day, the paint or sticker on the shapes started to peel off. Very disappointed and a very cheap product for what I paid. Waste of money.I bought another word puzzle for much less and it has been extremely durable."
3,jury is still out,"Got this for a 16-month old girl. she played with it over the course of a few days and it's been sitting in the corner since. I'm hopeful she'll pick it back up randomly like she does with many toys. She quickly picked up on which shapes go where, but her dexterity isn't always good enough to ""lock"" the pieces into place."
4,M & D shape puzzle,"I got this puzzle for my one year old son. He is too little to do the puzzle but he loves to hold the shapes and put them in his mouth. He has a few teeth so our puzzle pieces are munched around the edges and he drags them from place to place on our tiles so thet are getting scrapped up too. The paint has come off in a few places but if you got it for an older kid who doesn't put everything in his/her mouth I think that wouldn't be an issue. We spend time talking about the shapes and their colors, so I like the educational aspect of this puzzle. We will be buying more puzzles as he gets older."
2,a bit disappointed,"I typically love Melissa and Doug products, but I was very disappointed in this puzzle. The color on the shapes is only on the top, and the rest is just bare wood. My niece had teethed chunks of the colored paper off each shape less than half an hour after opening it. I know other M&D; puzzles are more durable, because I own a farm animal one I purchased several years back and the pieces are solid color on the front, back, and sides and have endured two children's teething just fine.Great concept, very disappointing quality. You can do better than this Melissa and Doug."
3,"very educational, but looks very worn after a few months","first i have to say my daughter LOVES this puzzle. we bought it for her when she was about 1 year old. she found the pieces much easier to hold an manipulate than the peg puzzles at that age. she learned her colors and shapes very soon afterwards. it is very pretty, but started getting chipped after a few uses. the puzzle pieces are not very durable in a toddler's hand's, unlike some other puzzles i have for her. i would still recommend it unless you can find a similar one of better quality."
5,perfect,not only did my 2 yearold learn shapes thanks to this puzzle but aslo his colors!!!! smart buy for all
5,Puzzle Fun,"I bought this puzzle for my 20 month old grandson, and he is learning to master it by himself and having fun doing so."
4,Okay,My fault for not looking at the publish date. It's 12 years old. I have to learn to read all the details! As far as shipping and condition Very Good.
4,"Well made, but...","my cat doesn't seem to be too interested in it at all unless I play with it with him. I guess it's good for the ""bonding"" process, but he seems to enjoy the other canip toys that he can destroy easily or cat crazies (especially his version of hockey in the bath tub)."
3,Bland Toy,"For some reason, my kitten does not play with this toy like he does with somany others I have purchased here. It doesn't crackle or squeak, so thatmay be the problem. On the plus side, it comes with catnip that's easy toput into the toy. If your cat/kitten loves catnip and doesn't mind thatthis toy makes no noise, then I would recommend it. For us, it was nogood."
5,Another great Kong product,"All my cats like Kong refillable cat nip toys, and this is no exception. They will pick it up and carry around with them until they find a good spot somewhere in the house. Then they flop on the floor and go to town- chewing, kicking, biting, throwing it. Great toy. Seems pretty durable so far (purchased about a month ago)."
5,fun cat toy,"The cats have had a lot of fun with this. For some reason when they are done playing with it, they put it in the dish with their crunchies."
3,Not great,"I had high hopes for this mirror but because the magnifying part flips over the real mirror it is not crystal clear and I don't think as magnified as it should be. It actually distorts the vision slightly, I would not purchase this again and I am looking for a replacement."
4,Great Product!,"I bought the table to put my stereo on, so I was a little nervous when reading other reviews that said the table was not very stable. I ordered it anyway because I have the matching shelf, coffee table, and end table and am very glad that I did. I am extremely happy with the table. It is not shaky at all and it perfectly accents my room. I am again impressed with the quality of the mission furniture."
5,Great multifunctional table at a great price!,"I love this table! I was looking for something to use as a vanity in my room (minus the mirror) because my dressers are very tall, and this fits the bill perfectly. I received the order ONE DAY after I placed it, and it came packaged very well with simple instructions and was easy to assemble. (I will note that they ought to have a native English speaker proofread the assembly instructions -- ""attack the cam screw"" was one of the funnier typos.) I think I'll be buying another one of these to use as a home bar -- love the color and finish! My one complaint is about the wood ""caps"" meant to cover the screw holes... some of mine were too small and slid all the way in and I cannot get them out. Minor issue with an otherwise fantastic buy."
1,So bad I returned it,"I thought this would be the perfect table for an odd space in my office. That might have been the case if I could have figured out how to put it together. In the hardware packet I had too many of some pieces and not enough of others. There were many things wrong with the instructions which were far from ""step by step."" Some of the hardware did not match the pictures in the instructions. The same was true for where holes were drilled in some of the wooden parts. I called the number on the front of the instructions for assistance and got passed around to many people who weren't much help. I finally gave up and sent it back. I can say that the Amazon return process gets 5 stars! I then got lucky and found the perfect table for my odd space at a local liquidation store which I was able to put together myself in about half an hour."
3,Unstable Table!!!,"For the price, this console table isn't bad. HOWEVER, I find it to be very unstable. The table top, shelf, and sides are held together with wooden dowels versus screws. When the table is touched, leaned on or bumped, it rocks, slowly pulling the pieces apart over time.I'm going to try super glue on mine and hope that the next time my Mother-In-Law leans on it to put her shoes on she doesn't end up on the floor."
5,Great Table,"The color is better (lighter) than in the picture, and the wood is very well laid out, with a variety of sized-lengths. It makes for an interesting layout. Also the grains varied, which also look great; easy to put together but the little circles used to hide the screws were too short. I filled up part of the hole with paper, and it looked fine."
4,Nice but.........,"This table is very nice and fits nicely with my decor, but I would have preferred not to have the aggravation of missing parts (10 wood plugs for screw holes) that neither Amazon.com or Target.com (the actual seller of this product) could provide to me. Each suggested that I disassemble the table, repack it and return for exchange or refund...this after I spent an hour assembling it! Ultimately I accepted Amazon's offer of a small refund and I would look for ""plugs"" at a building supply center. The refund, by the way, was considerably less than what it would have cost Amazon to pay return shipping and ship a replacement ($27.40 each way)."
2,Mission Console Table,I was very disappointed in the Mission Console table. It is not very sturdy. In my opinion it needs a second bottom apron to make it more sturdy. Also I think the instructions should tell you to put carpenters glue in the holes where the dowels go to help in making it more secure.
2,The book lacks maps,This would appear to be the only critical review of this admired book. I bought it as I was interested in reading about Islandhwana and any new insights that may come from this analysis.There is no new insight - the author unashamedly is a serving officer with the 24th Regt of which he writes glowingly about. Nothing really wrong with that except that the bias is there.This book lacks good clear maps to really follow the text appropriately - there is only one general map in small scale!Thus unfamilarity with place names mentioned in the text but not shown on the one map makes for very hard reading.Not for the general reader.
4,A Surprise!,"I came at this book from the Mansfield camp and a little exhausted by all of the stale comparisons between Mansfield and Woolf. However, Smith's work is full of well-researched and thoughtful analysis. It's an amazing study--particularly of Mansfield, I think--and one that belongs on the same shelf as Kaplan's KM & THE ORIGINS OF MODERNIST FICTION and Dunbar's RADICAL MANSFIELD. Essential reading for Mansfield scholars and fans alike."
4,A Surprise!,"I came at this book with an interest in Mansfield (and to a lesser extent Woolf) and was tired of the countless studies (chapters and essays) comapring the two. Needless to say, then, I approached this study with trepidation and assumed I would not think much of it. But what a surprise! Smith has done a terrific job with her research and has produced a study that towers over the others I've seen. The study smells of sweat and hard work. I put it alongside Sidney Janet Kaplan's and Patricia Dunbar's studies of Mansfield. It is one of the best."
4,Best in town...,"I originally owned the Kingston 128, but as time went on, I found that it wasn't enough memory for my needs. So, I moved up to 256, then on to 512. it's been a great tool for my needs. I move lots of docs and am able to use it to repair PC's. I highly recommend it.Pros:reliable, sturdy, adaptable (works in both PC/MAC's) and fits nicely in your pocket (don't forget it or you may wash it by accident, unfortunately, not water proof... :P)Cons:It's a little bulky, but that's only when compaired (ex. sandisk models, had one, but it was a piece of junk) a short adapter is included, which allows you to use it in tight spaces..Overall it's a quality item for a decent price. I've owned current one (Kingston 512MB) for over six months and use it almost every day.You can't go wrong with Kingston...."
2,first do no harm,This book is total fiction. I am a teacher working with many Dyslexics of all ages and none of the important or helpful information is referenced. If I were using this as a resource I would be seriously disheartened. fortunately there is valuable research being done and many successful programs available and many stunning breakthroughs right over the horizon.
5,Useful resource,"My son's tutor uses the word lists from this book and recommended it to me as a less academic read than some of the others books out there can be, but still with a lot of useful information. I'm glad I bought it, I've done some of the activities with my son and learned things I didn't know before (like maybe considering trying voice recognition computer programs). My son is going to school without a fight now. I don't think he'll ever get to the point where reading is like second nature but he has improved so much and is more optimistic about his education"
4,"""Judicial error does not exist""","Thoughtful meditation on a society in turmoil by the always interesting Italian/Sicilian writer, Leonardo Sciascia. While the story (serial killings of judges in an unnamed European country) is a police procedural on the surface, it is more Sciascia's pessimistic commentary on Italian politics of the 1970s. You have to wonder if he would have written the book any differently in the present. Certainly, most other current writers about crime in Italy (Leon, Lucarelli, Dibdin, and to some extent, Camilleri) are generous with barbs about official corruption and the hopelessness of achieving real justice in a society that is completely cynical about how power is used and abused in the country.In any event, the previous reviews for ""Equal Justice"" have pretty well nailed the essence. I would only add that Leonardo Sciascia is a pleasure to read in any format and this book is no exception."
4,"Often Maligned, but...","This book isn't as bad as one might believe it to be. Mainly it's been criticised by Robert Plant for Richard Cole selling out and manufacturing stories and attributing events to Zep. Still, it does give some insights into Cole's relationship with the band. Cole undeniably had a long history with Zeppelin. Like ""Hammer of the Gods"" - one has to take this one as an anecdotal account and with a pinch of salt...I found it to be readable."
3,Text book style writing,"Although Cole dishes up a lot of dirt that wasn't mentioned in ""Hammer of the Gods,"" his writing style, with the aid of Trubo, is so dry that it seems like he was trying to publish an article for a medical journal. (He uses the words ""inebriated"" and ""intoxicated"" so often that can you picture him looking up different ways to say he was drunk.) You also get the impression that he considered himself a member of the band. Too bad he didn't tell more of his stories to Stephen Davis when he was writing ""Hammer."" It would make for a lot better read."
2,Gratuitoulsy vulgar.,"This is mostly a vulgar, salacious, juvinile and generally banal account of one of the better Rock & Roll groups of all time. The text is mainly for a high school level of reader, and the sexual and drug related stories are disgusting and perverse. Not enough is said about the music, and too much is said about spoiled morons with too much money and not enough brains (or morals). To anyone who says this is the best book they have ever read, for Heaven's sake, get out of the house and buy some real literature."
1,Sack of ...,"Self-important blather from someone who enabled the terribly destructive habits of this band, and then complains that he wasn't given enough credit. What a useless sack of dog crap--the book AND the author."
2,Something smells here,"Another beach read, I picked this one up because I had left the book I had planned to take at home, and pickings were slim on the island where we stayed. In retrospect, I feel pretty bad about lining Richard Cole's pockets, but at the time it seemed like an entertaining enough subject. Within a few pages I had it pegged for what it was; a cash grab by someone who had pissed away the fortune that they'd made in their glory days. While I'd recommend ""Hammer Of The Gods"" for those interested in the Zeppelin story, I'd have to say this one should be avoided."
2,Redundancy,"The ""insider"" aspect is covered far better and more thoughtfully in other books on Zeppelin. Throughout the book, you get the feeling that Richard Cole is trying to elevate his status as an ""insider"" by telling every disgusting tidbit he can remember.Yes, they were young men in their 20's whose hormones were flowing in overdrive. Yes, they had the means to do whatever they wanted to. Yes, like most of us, they did things in their 20's that were callous, reckless and unconscionable. Yet do we really want to hear about another orgy 2/3's of the way through the book?The book falls into a boring repititve cycle. As a music fan, there are less than three pages devoted to any of their albums. Isn't that the main part about Zeppelin? The touring is an integral part of the story, but the music was the main part and anyone expecting to learn about that aspect of the Zeppelin mystique will be short-thrifted here."
3,Good Book!!,"I had found this book in my basement piled under all my brother's records and I had decided to give the book a shot. After reading it, I was amazed with all the stories that Richard Cole had, but I was disappointed in the way he delivered it. I found that he didn't elaborate on most of the events that occured in the book. During his description regarding the process of writing and recording each of Led Zeppelin's albums, it only summed up to be a couple of pages long at the most. (And keep in mind it is written in large font.) Some of his stories were so outrageous and unbelievable, that it leaves you wondering if some of it were true or not. Or quite possibly, could these illusions have been the result of the alcohol and drug binges that were a part of their everyday life. Never the less, it was a great read."
4,"Led Zeppelin, the sex, drugs, and fun.....","Personally i think this was a very intrseting book. It's been said many times that most of it was lies. Now i'm not saying that, that statement is wrong but i dont think all of the book is fiction. Maybe 40% of it is. I think Cole only did it for money because he was broke. Many people would probably agree with me that the only reasons cole was the tour manager was because he thought they had potential to make him money and so he could score some free smack. It's one of the better books bout the band, but, Page should get an authour to write his story of led zeppelin. Not that page needs or wants anymore money but the truth should be known. P.S If anyone thinks that Plant (Eventhough he was great) was not the reason Zep was good... Page = Zeppelin."
2,"Being from an insider, I expected more","The book deals way too much with the tabloid-y aspects of the band. Yes, we knew they were hardcore partiers, we knew they were into the booze and drugs. Yes, Cole was there so his perspective means something, but no real insight into the genius of the members, the stories relating how the songs came together, etc. What a shame. Cole could have had something special, but instead choose to over-emphasize the frat boy mentality of the sex, drugs, and rock and roll world.This book is no better that Stephen Davis' Hammer of the Gods."
3,Are you dizzy when you're stoned? Cole is!,"I understand Richard Cole is supposed to be a first-hand account of Led Zepp's outrageous events, but c'mon. Can he really remember what happened with his girlfriend while he and Jimmy were snorting coke- all those years ago? I can't remember what I ate for breakfast a week ago. Richard Cole tries to entertain us but it's a weak attempt at best, especially the bits where he shares his women with the band. Try the other way around, squire. I gave Stairway a 3 star only because, like it or not, Cole was the inside man to the mania and probably witnessed most of what he wrote about. Give credit where it's due. The rest was probably made up while he was on the loo."
4,Insider's look at Zeppelin,"Richard Cole was there. For pretty well all of it. Consequently, he should at least know the truth of what he saw or participated in. Dark, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, it is clear that Cole loved the guys very much and bears some animosity to what has happened since those days. Loosely written, some facts are dubious, does not agree in some areas with other written histories, or with interviews offered by Page, Plant or Jones"
3,Too much of a good thing,"This book is interesting for a while, but I started to tire of reading it 3/4 of the way through, just like the band got tired of playing."
1,Pack of Lies,"If I could rate this book a zero, I would. It's even worse than the other ""tell all biography"", 'Hammer of The Gods'. These are Richard Coles egomaniacal, crack induced fantasies of what he wishes life with Led Zeppelin was. 90% of the book is pure fantasy. Want proof? The boys in the band released statements renouncing the book and Cole himself. The fact is this book is more an attempt by Richard Cole to boost his own ego than a factual account. If you like fairy-tales, get it. Otherwise, well, I guess we're still waiting for an accurate and well writen biography. Someone,anyone? Wanna help us out?"
5,You will not put this book down!,"This book is a classic Cole was there for most of Zeppelin's career, and tells many stories that won Zeppelin their title for ""One of the most rambunctious bands of all time"" A must read for all Zep fans."
3,There are better Zep books,"Even though Richard Cole was the road manager and has some good stories to tell, he basically comes off like a blabbermouth who should have just been loyal and quiet about his friends. Led Zep rocked, and that's all you need to know."
3,"Pretty good, but not much new","Several of the stories I'd heard before, but the book was still pretty good. Cole even managed to surprise me with a few tales I'd never heard before. Such as Bonzo driving a VW bug into a lake to see if it would float! Cole is pretty honest about his own shortcomings and drug use. I'm surprised he lasted as Zep's tour manager as long as he did! There are a number of stories about the band treating people like trash, but I never suspected them of being boy scouts. I got the impression Cole was more of a hellraiser than any Led Zep band member. With the exception of Bonzo perhaps. ""Hammer of the Gods"" was a more entertaining book. I had trouble getting through this book, setting it down for weeks at times."
3,"Entertaining, but...","I read this book in a day. It's an easy read, and very funny. But I take what I read with a grain of salt. I'm not sure how credible Richard Cole is, and I'm unsure of his motivation.I would have enjoyed a deeper look into who the members of Zeppelin really were. But you never achieve that with this book. What you see, is what Richard was made privy to. And I don't believe it was much. That most of what you do see, is the drunken escapades, tells me a drunken escapade is what it took for the band to allow him into their circle. Drunkeness or a crisis.I don't doubt Cole's affection for the band. This shows through in the writing. But I do doubt the overall accuracy of the picture.Still, as someone who was born in 1971, this book really did help me to better understand a group I've long admired, albeit after the fact. But I'll keep reading, with hopes of seeing the entire picture."
2,Shallow and vapid,"This book offers the promise of an inside look at Zeppelin, given that Richard Cole was probably closer to the group than anyone aside from Peter Grant. But the inside look he provides only extends as far as descriptions of the debauchery that accompanied the group's earlier tours. His insights generally all share the same sophomoric form, such as: We drank a lot of beers that night, boy were we wasted! And the writing style is hilarious. This book probably sets a record for the use of exclamation points since virtually all of the accounts of dialog are of a form like: Jimmy turned to me and said 'Richard, surely you're mad!' It isn't totally without merit as this does paint an outline of the band's story and at the end you gain a sense of the chronology of the tours and albums. But that's where the merits end. There must be a good story to be told of Zeppelin's history, but this isn't it."
4,Good Information,"Never having had any experience or knowledge on the basis of this disease, I got the book to help me understand my father's disease. I have gotten a fuller understanding of the causes of the disease, the symptoms, the treatments (and making decisions regarding the selections of the treatments), and the progression of the disease. I feel much better informed and feel I can support my father better because of it. It was definitely written to help support the patient and family supporting that patient."
3,Very Basic,"This would be a good book for someone newly diagnosed or only a few years into their diagnosis, but if you have had Parkinsons for more than a few years, the information in this book is nothing new. For more advanced Parkinsons disease, there are far better books out there. And if you get onto many of the PD websites, you can download a lot of the information that is contained in this book for free. I had gotten this book on review recommendations and was looking for information on Vitamin D deficiencies for my mother who has PD. This book did not even mention the fact that more than 50% of PD patients have a severe Vitamin D deficiency, which can cause all kinds of problems."
4,Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson's Disease: A Complete Guide for Patients and Families--bit depressing but informative; good symptom checkklist in back of book-- worth the money
5,A Wonderful Reference For Parkinson's Disease,This was a very helpful book to understand Parkinson's Disease a little better. It gave me an insight into what my aunt goes through on a daily basis with her Parkinson's Disease. I recommend this book to anyone that has or can relate to somebody with Parkinson's. I've been reading a lot about Parkinson's Disease and this book along with a short book calledParkinsons Disease (Parkinson's Disease & Forced Exercise)which speaks to the importance of a specific type of exercise routine and seems to be helping.
5,You'll want to eat this with a spoon!,"And you can because its that mild.I'm a chilihead from way back, and a friend of mine turned me onto this stuff so I picked it up and made some Chili Verde. One bite and I was completely hooked. It wasn't what I expected, I knew the serranos weren't going to blow my socks off, but they are barely noticeable. But that sweet and tangy tomatillo and garlic flavor is just right for flavoring dishes like this, or just eating with chips, nobody will complain about the heat...its not there. Also wonderful on homemade fish tacos.You may have to search high and low for this locally, I have one store that carries it and they are always sold out, so buy an extra jar if its available."
1,"It's alright, but not worth the $10","This salsa is in fact quite good, however, no better than other salsa verde that you might find at your local grocery store and that is made closer to where you live. If you're into hot salsa, this one is just a little hotter that, say the one sold at Trader Joe's, but you can hardly tell the difference. Bottom line is it's a good enough salsa, my concern is that it's not fantastic, and specially not worth the $10 (with shipping) for 16oz."
5,Where Chase books are available in abundance...,"To the reader who asked about where Chase books are available. I grew up in India and in my youth spent many happy hours reading Chase books borrowed from an Uncle who had the complete collection. In fact he had ""Cade"" half open on his in his hands and a beatific smile on his face when he passed on.As far as I know Chase books are still available in many of the older book stores in many Indian metros. If you can't find it in the bigger stores second-hand book stores will definitely be able to offer you the complete selection."
2,The Remix,"Jay Benson Ex-army musketry trainer, and his wife Lucy's dream of running a shooting school turns sour as the school heads towards certain closure. They need cash - badly, and more of it seems. At the last minute, Augusto Savanto, head of a vast corporation in Venezuela, walks into their lives with a proposition they can hardly reject; he has offered to pay them $50,000 to transform his son into an expert marksman, within a period of nine days. Jay and Lucy Benson, being desperate for the dough accepts the challenge but find themselves in a deadly game of ruthless and genuinely intense murder."
5,A Welcome Relief!,"As an immigrant to the US, I have always struggled with how companies work in this country. I have been here for nearly 20 years and I have still not fully adjusted to the way things are done here. Dilip Saraf's ""Conquering Your Workplace"" is a welcome relief. The book is written for anyone who finds working inside organizations puzzling. The author has done a good job of describing all the important basics in an organized style. Chapters and Appendix material is very useful. Immigrants, who have problems at work, will find how to get success when reading this book."
1,Will not ship to California !,"I placed an order, received confirmation, and the next day received an email stating that they would not ship to California due to regulatory considerations. I wonder what those regulatory considerations may be. Last time I looked California was still one of the fifty states. If they do not ship to selected states, they should note that on their page. Not a vendor that I would ever use again."
5,Square delivers on mini-games as per usual,"This game brings in a lot of classic Final Fantasy characters and music. Its great for nostalgia, and a solid addition to any Square / Enix collection."
2,review,this game was a bit boring and did not hold my attention. i ended up taking it in to a game exchange store very shortly after getting it.
3,not as expected,"was not that fun compared to other rpg game, it can do a lot better. i guess i thought it'll be more like ffiii so i was disappointed when i played it."
1,Not for adults,"I imagine this game would be quite fun for small children, but marketing it under the Final Fantasy name smacks of a marketing gimmick to sell more copies to the fans of the franchise. I'd recommend for 3-7 years of age."
4,Final Fantasy: A lovable brand name,"At first I was a little skeptical with the whole ""storybook"" approach. After the first few mini-games though I became hooked. All the main mini-games are a lot of fun, plus there are tons of other sidequest mini-games. The card duel style is interesting but nonetheless fun. I think any Final Fantasy fan would enjoy all of the references to classic monsters and characters. The games are fun, and some are suprisingly challenging to fully unlock. Overall I give this game a 4/5."
4,Simple but versatile,"The organizer is simple, but that's its strength. There's nothing to not fit. There's nothing to break. On an arm rest it works as exected, but I wanted to hang it off the bed, to hold a book, remote control, my glasses and a glass of water. With that much stuff, the friction on the flap is insufficient, so I compensated with a two-cent safety pin. My water glass was also heavy and sagged a bit. That one took a small peice of cardboard. Now its perfect. I've been using it for a month now and don't even need to look to find stuff. No spills and my glasses are safe and at hand."
2,Not great,"In theory this is cool. In reality, it's flimsy and of poor quality - not worth the money I paid for it. Then add on shipping costs .... well, that's like salt in the wound."
1,crappy,This was very shabby and the cloth was like a cheap sack. So ugly didn't want it for what I needed it for...to hang from my recliner. Material is awful.
1,Forget it !,It was a piece of junk. The material was creased and looked shabby. This product deserves ZERO stars and should not be sold.
3,sidekick organizer,"I like the spaces it has, however it slips down if I put a thick book in the large pocket.I think it needs to be weighted."
2,doesn't hang well,does not hang on chair arm well at all. with a box of tissues in the one pocket it is difficult to reach in other pocket
1,wrong relay image & p/n listed & received,They are selling the wrong breaker not the one show on the web image. I had to argue to receive a return call tag against their will. Even though the wrong product was clearly identified the site has since not yet been corrected. Why can't someone just get off there ass and correct the problem? I guess they are just too profitable and don't care.
5,Dramatic instrumental spacemusic,"I discovered this CD quite accidentally but I was very impressed with the music. CD was issued by Hearts of Space, which is well known to all new age music fans. Steve McDonald is New Zeeland's leading electronic keyboard artists and his music compares with Patrick O'Hearn or Ian Boddy. There are 8 suites on this CD, all instrumental, with nice rhythhms, some are fast-paced, some are slower. I liked track 6 in particular, which starts with the sound of sea waves abd then builds momentum."
4,Good Buy!,Mission Natural Coffee Table is a great buy. It looks like we spent a lot more money on it then we did. We just bought our first home and it has been expensive!! But a lot of fun. We have been looking for a light wood coffee table and this is one of the best out there.
5,It's a survivor,"I've owned this coffee table for four years, and it has received constant abuse... soldiering on through four different roommates, four moves, and countless parties. It's been sat on, danced on, and used as a footrest, coaster and ashtray... and the only thing wrong with it now is that it's a little bit wobbly, which I could fix if I had the initiative to get down there and tighten the screws. I've been extremely happy with it... and if something *does* happen to mine, I'll probably buy another one just like it."
3,Good buy,"The price is good. I really like the table. One thing, it came with one slight ding to the wood on the side, not that noticiable, but I know it is there. Amazon was great and refunded me a % for the damage, since I didn't want to return it. I was very happy with the outcome. Nice, inexpensive furniture. Very easy to put together."
1,horrible table,i had this tablle for about 4 months. When i first put the table together i noticed the the quality of wood was not great as there is a knot in the top of the table. I also noted after being put together there was never a tight fir. since then the table has benn getting worse every day. the screws holding it together were not doing a very good job keeping it from swaying. The bottom shelf fell off after about 2 months. Today the whole table just fell down. Two of the 4 screws that hold the top o the frame split in half and the top part of the leg where the two prg holes are split. while this table will work for a short term solution don't count on it lasting for more than 6 months.
4,Good buy for the price...,"I am a college student with a budget who bought the mission coffee table for my new apartment. It was easy to assemble (although the screws provided stripped easily and the alignment was a bit off), and it looked great when finished.I love the style and natural color, and recommend it for anyone on a budget who seeks nice looking furniture.My only wish was that it was a few inches longer in length, other than that, its Great!"
2,Cheap!,"Table came with chipped wood on one leg. When put together, the chip got even worse. The table is horribly unsteady. Would not recommend to anyone."
3,Get What You Pay For,"I was having the same instability issues that a lot of others here seem to be having, so I finally flipped it over (assembled) and added Elmer's wood glue around all the joints, and it seems to have done the trick...for now. Just remember you get what you pay for. My opinion is that if you're going to go cheap furnishing your home, go to garage sales and thrift shops. You'll get a lot better quality stuff for the same amount of money."
4,Compliments Small Living Room Nicely,Very nice coffee table. Good size for small living room. Nice looking. Assembly was relatively easy. Only problem was screwing the top on was a little difficult.
4,Great buy for the $$,"If you're going to buy a coffee table for $70 with free shipping, you can't really expect the highest of quality right? After a few months of having this I noticed a crack in the top of the table (you would only notice if you're moving it). Other than that, the table has been fine, crack still there obviously but hasn't really grown and the remaining parts of the table have held up quite well. I have to say I am very happy I spent the extra $10 on this nice looking table than that cheap-o one I was looking at from IKEA. Oh yeah, it can also hold a surprising amount of weight on the bottom layer."
5,Great Table,I purchased both the coffee table and end table from this line. Both are very sturdy and of good quality. I had tables from Walmart which did not compare at all to these Target tables. The quality is much better.
4,Small Apartment Living at it's Best,"If you live in a small apartment, everything should be streamlined, sleek, space-spacing, or do double duty. This coffee table addresses several of these subjects/problems. Like all Mission style furniture, it is, if not sleek, at least minimilistic. With the shelf below, it gives you a storage spot for the 5 remotes everyone seems to own these days, while leaving space above for those huge Coffee Table books that no one actually reads...you can afford other lovely co-ordinating furniture in the same style. I'd love to completely re-do my apartment with furnishings from Target's furniture department. Great for the just out of college person!"
4,Great value,"I am very pleased with this coffee table. The construction is very solid, and the finish is very durable. You will not find a better coffee table for the price. I am buying the mission bookcase and end-table to match!"
4,Mission Coffee Table,"I bought the whole set. Two end tables, coffee table and the console table. All were real easy to put together, did it all in an afternoon. Would recommend to anyone who wanted great furniture at a reasonable price."
2,What was this?,"I thought I had goten a movie with Fran Drescher, you know the Nanny Series. Anyway, I really didn't like this movie. It was too late to get my money back."
3,Doesn't go into much depth,"This book is great if you're straddling the fence about beginning urine therapy. There are many articles & research studies which can help to give one a more open minded view of the subject. However if you are already practicing urine therapy, there's a good chance you won't learn much. The author scratches the surface of many different applications but doesn't go into much detail in my oppinion."
2,"Therapy is good, but book really isn't","The main reason I bought this book was because of the authors miraculous recovery from illness using the Urine Therapy. Her story is the first chapter of the book, how she went from years and years of misery to total wellness in a short period of time using her own urine.After that initial chapter, the book pretty much stinks. The information isn't very in depth, the ideas jump around a lot, and it's content is sloppy.I believe Urine Therapy is a wonderful practice, and it has its benefits, but this book just doesn't get to the root of why it's beneficial. There's testimonials in the book. Some people get excited about testimonials, which is fine, but they don't do anything for me. You need something more than 50 pages of testimonials to shed some light on why we should be drinking some of our own medicine every day."
2,Better Information Elsewhere,"Like another reviewer noted, this is primarily one chapter containing a good account of personal recovery from debilitating illnesses using urine therapy, but beyond that, it isn't much. Even the physical quality of the book leaves a lot to be desired. Appears to have been composed with a cheap word processor and printed at Kinko's and my copy has lines that are difficult to read because the ink prints only a small portion of the type. Van Der Kroon's book is much more in depth and would be money better spent. You can also search the Internet and get better information than this book provides. I gave it two stars because of the author's testimonial, would otherwise have given it one."
5,The Bigger and Cheaper Hope for everyone looking for help,"This book it's great, I've read three other books on the subject after this one, and this is the best, with medical research references, it gives the book great credibility.I fasted 4 days and lost 4.5 kg... and feel better,this information should be given to people with cancer, arthritis, asthma, allergies, etc.It doesn't have lateral efects... it's great.You should give it a try before using the ""advice"" of any doctor."
4,Very Impressive!,"The book contains a lot of information on a subject that is little-known in the USA. The author writes passionately on the subject because it has changed her life. Her use of many references should be of help to skeptics. Her instructions are helpful to anyone desiring to try this ""cure."" Her work is thorough and easy to read."
2,Dull novel about a woman finding her aunt..,"""The Embroided Sunset"" is a flat attempt at a mystery. An American woman living with a nasty uncle goes to Yorkshire to find out if her aunt is really dead or alive. She never does find the answer to this, but she does discover that her ""aunt"" is in danger as she stumbles into where a mad criminal has escaped. The writing is too vague, and there is a odd climax dealing with a flood and a badly built carpark(parking garage), and an ending that bums us out and makes us curse the book for wasting our time."
4,Cajun Pioneer Live!,"Joe Falcon attained legendary status as the first Cajun accordionist to record. He was also one of the most prolific Cajun artists to record before World War II. Joe continued to play well into the 1960s and this is a live recording of a gig he did in Scott, Louisiana. The recording is important for many reasons. First off, the music is great Cajun music in the 1950s dancehall style. There is a burning version of the ""Flames of Hell"" --check out the drumming by Joe's wife, which sounds like whips being cracked in Dante's Inferno. Joe didn't record much late in life, so this is a nice example of how his sound had progressed since the 1920s. Finally, this is a rare early live Cajun recording. You can even hear the glasses tinkling in the background. Plus the sound quality is very good. A must for Cajun and Coountry collections."
1,Not receive it yet????,I am still waiting on this product to arrive????? I order a lot online andnever find this problems. If I do not get it soon I expect a full refund.Thanks
4,perfume,"I bought this because of other recommendations about the scent lasting. although I like the scent a lot. It is very feminine, worthy of Elizabeth Arden, I didn't think the scent lasted very long on me. I know different skin types hold scent differently, but I don't know if I will buy it again when there are so many others out there."
2,Elizabeth Arden???,"I gave this order five stars originally, but then I opened the perfume. It was shipped quickly, but NOWHERE on the bottle does it say Elzabeth Arden, and it just does not smell like the original True Love. I am unhappy with the product."
2,cheap and not so good,"I thought this perfume was nice, kinda sweet or something like this, But ain't like this. There is no fixation, you put and in 03/04hours the smell is gone...Don't buy!"
1,not long lasting,I purchased this not knowing how it smelled. I liked the smell from the bottle and when it's first sprayed but the fragrance was gone within minutes and never could even get a hint of it throughout the day.
3,not the same,i had a bottle of this years ago and loved it but found it was 50 to 100 bucks in stores.i know why the price is low...it smells like a watered down version.
5,This is great stuff,"My wife loves it, and I love the price and how quick I got it. I'm not positive that it isn't a knock off, the scent doesn't last very long, but it does smell exactly like the True Love she ran out of."
2,Cheap side material tears easily!,"The top of this mattress pad is fine, comfortable, and holding up well. The material for the sides, however, is cheap and flimsy. It tears a little more each time I remake the bed. I'll have to replace it soon just because there won't be enough left intact to hold it on. I do not recommend purchasing this!"
3,not what you think,I don't think this was an original product. The paper was a reprint of an original and the first time I put it on the bed - the skirt ripped.
1,DO NOT BUY IT IS A RIP OFF,IF ANYONE IS LOOKING TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM I ADVISE U NOT TO!!!! IT SUPPOSE TO BE QUEEN SIZE AND IT LOOKS LIKE ITS A TWIN SIZE PAD. IT WOULDN'T EVEN FIT AT THE TOP OF MY BED LET ALONE COVERING THE ENTIRE BED. IT LOOKS AS IF IT WAS USED. I AM TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED I HAVE NEVER ORDERED ANYTHING FROM AMAZON THAT DISPLEASED ME AS MUCH THIS PIECE OF CRAP!! i SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED MY FIRST MIND. MONEY DOWN THE D*** DRAIN!!
5,Great price for a great pad.,"I was a little hesitant to buy this mattress pad, wondering if it would be what I wanted, given its low price. The Simmons name convinced me to try it. It's perfect."
1,This may be the worst purchase ever from Amazon,"This mattress pad is so cheaply made that the minute i took it out of the packaging and tried to put it on my mattress, it ripped TWICE. Will never order anything from this manufacturer again"
2,Not quite right,Looked difrent than the product in the picture and had troble mounting it to one of my trackers and would not fit the other.
2,wrong one,"I actually received the wrong model. The sealed package had the model number that I had ordered. But, I got the 4 screw model instead of the 6 screw model. Would not fit. Product returned and refunded."
5,Great scope mount,"By no fault of the seller, I actually received the wrong model. The sealed package had the model number that I had ordered. But, I got the 4 screw model instead of the 6 screw model. With only minor modifications, I was able to make it fit. The scope then mounted easily. Great product ---Not so great packaging/labeling."
2,What was the point?,"What was the point of this book? First of all the people who he calls poor in the West are different that those in the third world. They are mostly substance abusers and or mentally ill which is what led to their poverty. It would have been far more informative if he had spoken to working poor. Second, the book was all about him and it reminded me of a college freshman lacking self-confidence debating all kinds of questions. Third, the photos were generally of poor quality and did not contribute. Fourth, paying people to answer your questions is not a good way to get true information about poverty. There were parts of the book where the writing was excellent which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1."
3,Dated Canadian rock music,"It's not bad, sounding like a mix of Styx and Saga with some Prism thrown in. It does sound a bit dated, but if you like the previously mentioned bands, you'll enjoy this."
3,Works OK,"The archery netting isn't suitable for today's high speed ( greater than 300 fps) compound bows. It works for stopping arrows that go through a targert, such as a bale of straw. However, high speed arrows go right through the net if a target is missed and the netting is the only barrier to the arrow. This product would probably work fine for recurve bows or youth but doesn't work for modern high speed compound bows or crossbows using field points for target practice."
1,not what I thought it was,the description said grommets every 24 inches but did not say it was only on one side the other sides were not vinyl finished.so I sent it back
2,Boring but good backgound music,"I was looking for another Native American flute artist after discovering R. Carlos Nakai, whom I really like. Based upon reviews by a self-professed flautist and appreciater of Native American flautists, despite not being able to learn anything about the music from listening to the 30 second sound bites, I purchased the album. Big disappointment. There is a fine line between subtle and boring. This music is so unvarying and monotonous that it far transgresses that line. It is expensive white noise. I can understand it being used for entirely unobtrusive background music at a spa but for anyone who wants to LISTEN to flute music it is a complete waste of time. Also, when I meditate I don't want any other noise than my breathing so it is of no use to me for that purpose.Your tastes may difer from mine but I strongly recommend that you listen to the entire album before purchasing it."
5,A truly magical sonic masterpiece,"All of the praise this recording receives is appropriate and well-put. This is much more than a floaty, ""new age"" CD with loads of reverb and soothing sinewaves; it's a spiritual experience. If you're looking for something of the same order as Peter Gabriel's ""Passion"" but a bit more gentle, definitely give ""Thunder Chord"" a try. It will heal you."
4,A Wanted Man,"The protagonist Harry Raines sees Col. Edward Baker the man that he is to protect killed. Of course Harry is found with the body and he becomes a wanted man by the North. The Confederates also want Harry. He has no choice but to solve this murder. I found the first of the book rather slow but I liked the mystery intrigue of Kilian's books. He also uses a little humor to entertain us. By Ruth Thompson the author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
4,Business card holder with some sex appeal,"Who says you have to be boring when networking ?? Stand out with some ""bling bling"" ! (lol)"
1,don't judge a book by it's cover,"It was beautiful, in perfect condition and if I wanted a silver case it would have been fantastic...but I returned it for in the picture (even compared to other products they sell) it looks gold. To my dismay it was not, nor do they sell gold... I hope they now have the word silver or chrome to describe the product for future buyers."
2,Don't believe the dimensions,"This item is much smaller than the dimensions indicate. The length measurement includes the visor. The height and width are the exterior of the visor, not the door or the interior space which only get narrower. It is very pretty, but nowhere near big enough for any kind of pet over 15lbs."
1,Complicating the simple and confusing the clear,"This book has been a huge disappointment. Wrox books had thehabit of being no BS, clear, hands-on, detailed techical tutorials.. and this is why they had their original success. But now, perhaps in conjunction with being bought by Wiley, Wrox is definitely going down. The authors of this book souns like IBM managers, not certainly programmers. The first chapters do not contain ANY techical info but just advertising for IBM products (I am not making this up..!)The rest of the presentation is a confused, disorderly, bloated,verbose, unnecessarily complicated sequence of ""click here and then click there"" instructions. If you have some brains this book will be unbearable, if you have none, well you're probably one of the authors.What is most irritating and annoying about this book is the pompous, monotonous, slow tone aimed at passing straightforwardtechnical notions for rocket science, which unfortunately seems to be a general trend at IBM."
2,Surprisingly Unhelpful,"There are a lot of things wrong with this book. I gained very little on WAS (ass opposed to WSAD, which I don't use) from it that wasn't available in the application docs (which are pretty poor to start with). But let me sum it up with an example.The cover says ""A Guide to Building J2EE Applications"". In the index under debugging, I find:debugger, 78debugging business processes, 461-462I don't know about anyone else, but such minimal coverage of such an important topic makes me think that the authors must not have ever actually developed an application using WAS."
1,the damned software doesn't work!,"I paid OVER $80 for this book (dumb me, I know...) hoping I could get a version of WebSphere that might work with some sample applications but I was apparently asking too much. I go through the entire 30 minute installation process from both CDsand then when I start WSAD 5.0 I get the helpful error messagetelling me that 'The license cannot be found. IBM Websphere Studio application developer version 5.0.0 cannot start'. Well,THANKS A LOT IBM - taking a lesson from the Microsoft playbook?And OF COURSE there is no reference to this problem in the book or on the WROX website though there at least 20 license.* files installed with WSAD, none of which have anything to do with an actual license that can be read by WSAD when it starts. I'm taking the book back and hope I can get refund so I don't have to spend a day trying to figure this mess out. Thank God for WebLogic...."
2,Unclear,It is very hard to follow the example that is covered in various chapters.The optimization and tuning the server is hardly there.
5,Amazing,"This book with CD is a must have. After reading, and listening to it I gained a new look at my walk with Christ. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
4,This will fire you up,"This is a very good book on evangelism and in it does Comfort make a strong case for using the law in evangelism. He argues that its the only way throughout, but explicitly states that the law is the way to bring conviction on page 167. The book is loaded with stories, illustrations, wisdom from the Bible, and witnessing advice. Comfort is quite confrontational in the book, and tells many stories of being rejected. However he also has many stories of how God used him to reach a lost soul. The book is very easy to read and written for the laymen. Only major complaint is that he does not give an in-depth analysis about how to witness to cults, and culture Christians. But overall a good book to fire up people for evangelism."
5,Superb,"This book is superb. As with most of Rays books it is easy to read and funny. It exposes a common serious problem of ""easy prayerism"" which is so common today. And focuses the need for proper biblical salvation rather than just calling on Jesus for life enhancement. At the end of the book there are a few good ideas for evangelism and motivates oneself to do more in evangelism."
5,This book should be read by everyone.,"This book should be read by everyone. For those who do not believe in God's wrath, need to read this book to understand the concepts of the 10 commandments and how each and everyone of us breaks them. Everyone will realize that this is true because of their conscience that is written on their hearts. We mostly all believe that we are good people, but when you judge yourself against the 10 commandments....you realize how we all fall short. Repent, and put all your trust in Jesus if you want to enter into the kingdom of heaven."
4,No scruples on my conscience!,The book has totally changed my view on management of my business and the way my business is run. The book points out all the good things that business' could do and all the things that business' don't do. I know my business certainly does do them all now. This is a revolutionary book and the first of its kind. A fantastic pioneering venture into the world of Corporate Responsibility! Well done Mr. Cowe for this fantastic editorial. When's the next book?
3,Some info in here not anywhere else,"The Banks book is a typical user guide replacement text, though he makes mention of some items that other books don't -- DM in ROM and what some of the various files do, for example. I keep the book for the file list in the back. The material in the book itself may be useful for someone w/o any DM documentation. If you still use DM or just bought a used machine with DM, this might be a good addition to your library."
4,"Not an original parts, but works","It's not an original parts from Hoover. But it works fine so far even though it came in smaller and I needed to stretch it a little bit to put it on. It's a little surprise that it came with 2 so that I have a spare to use. For a low price with free shipping, what can I ask for?"
2,Hoover belt No. 38528027,"I bought 2 belts from Amazon.com for my Vacuum cleaner Model No.U4617-910D2 and was sent the belts with the wrong number. The recommended belt is 38528-027These two belts are too short, a lot too short. There is only one belt that could fitthe Dual Purpose Hoover Vacuum Cleaner (Elite II). No amount of streaching make it work.Obviously the 38528040 is the wrong belt. Is the original belt sold by Amazon?"
5,Original,"This belt went right on, good fit, always found the original stuff seems to always work the best. love it"
2,Hoover belt - replacement,Replacement number does not fit !!! It is wider and shorter than the original therefore useless to me. Money wasted.
2,Demby Enters a Black Hole,"I am a Constance Demby fan. However, this CD was disappointing. The harpsicord sound throughout overshadowed the other sounds of the songs. The harpsicord became repetitive and irritating at the same time. I would recommend Novas Magnificant and Aetna."
4,Does Aladdin's lamp really exist?,"In this story it does! This story is about two children who find an old lamp at a garage sale, and actually beilieve that there is a genie inside of it. It's a really cute how the children really believe it could happen. This story could've been written by a child, because somehow the kids manage to convince their step mom that the murders have something to do with the lamp. The killer follows the main characters in the story, state to state address to address. It's creepy, and it' kinda of like a mystery, yet it's scary. It just amazes me how Ruby can take ordianary objects like say, a jump rope, and make it scary somehow. I have to say this is prob. one of my favorite Ruby Jensens 'cause it basically takes place in Ft. Smith Arkansas where my mother is from. The plot is simple once again, but still it is a good story."
1,Doesn't point North,"I bought this for my 7 YO. It was meant for fun more than anything else. Of course I didn't expect it to be very accurate, but this compass doesn't point North. Let me be specific, it does point North sometimes, sometimes East, South, West or anywhere in between. It's pretty random. Like I said, accuracy was not a requirement, but it needs point generally North.It doesn't appear that this is just a defective unit. It seems that the magnet is not strong enough to move the dial. Just a bad design. Avoid this model."
3,Neat little laser pointer for the money.,"The threads on my old red dot pointer stripped so bad, that the caps wouldn't stay on, which basically rendered the pointer unusable. I was pleased that this pointer came with a durable metal carrying case. Put some bubble wrap inside to keep the thing from moving around in the case. The pointer itself is an all metal tube with fine machine cut threads securing the end caps. Well made, for the money.UP close in a dark room I'm OK, but I can't see red dot laser pointers from any distance, due to my poor color vision. I first saw a green dot sight at a gun show. When I saw the dot from several hundred yards away I knew I had to get one for hunting, and find a green laser pointer as well.Yeah, the beam on this pointer isn't well collimated, and the further away from the target you get, the blurrier the dot becomes, but I can still see it easily."
2,A major disappointment,Stopped working after 1 day so I didn't really get a chance to experience how well it works. I would say the poor quality explains why it was reduced so low from its retail price.
1,Terrible Product,"Honestly I'm not even sure why i got this, I used it for less than an hour, and then when I pressed the button, the laser wouldn't even come out. waste of 30 dollars."
2,Probably not worth it,It was very bright at first. Then button began malfunctioning. I emailed customer service and never heard back. Don't know if it was a problem with my unit or a poor quality button.
2,burnt out after I had it for a few weeks,laser diode died after a few weeks of possession. wasn't happy. no way to repair it.
1,miracle beam laser pointer,Off/on switch seemed defective. Was extremely difficult to turn on and keep on. I returned this and will try another brand.
2,Pointer Bright for a few Seconds,"It was bright for the first couple of uses, about 20 seconds, then went dim. Now it's bright the first 1/2 a second or second then immediately dims when you press the button. Tried two sets of replacement batteries with the same results. The unit comes only with zinc batteries. Case differs from what's pictured. Back it goes."
4,Very strong,"It works very well. But, as others Green Laser Pointers, it very strong, not to useful in a presentation inside a room."
2,Cheap laser,I purchased this laser pointer to play with my dogs out side. I have a green laser pointer from Wicked Laser that is a little more expensive but the quality product as far a building is far superior to that of this laser pointer. I thought I would see if I could get something close to the quality of the Wicked Laser but this is not even in the same game. I have owned the Wicked Laser Pointer for over two years now and uses it both morning and later afternoon to play with my dogs for about a 1/2 each time and still not problems with the Wicked Laser Point. I was looking for a good back up but this one is not it. Save yourself some time and purchase a better built one like Wicked Laser
5,Excellent laser pointer,"I really like this pointer. At night, you can see a thin, green beam through the sky. You can also see its reflection off clouds! However, I would be careful with this: you could get in trouble if you hit someone's car with it, or shine it in someone's house. It really is very bright!"
1,NOT STABLE,"the unit is not stable. The laser has deffects in size and the intensity is variable. Beaware, maybe I got a deffective one so I am thinking about returning it."
1,Amazing at first.,I was very surprised at how strong the beam was initially. Problem was that the unit is very cheaply made and the contact point with the button became loose by the 2nd hour of operation. This resulted in an inconsistent beam that worked only part of the time.
4,I'd buy it again.,"Found some recipes to try. I collect cookbooks, so I am always looking. This is a very nicely written cookbook."
2,"Guide to ""SOME"" Radios",Don't waste your time. Way off on prices-(low). Looked up the first ten tombstone radios on ebay and only one was in the book.Take the money you wound spend on this and get something with a high recommendation.
3,Ancient Greece Deserving Better Than this Average Production,"This DVD set is made up of documentaries of variable quality. The documentaries ""Gods and Goddesses,"" ""The Greek Gods,"" and ""Oracle at Delphi"" are worth watching. The documentaries about battles are too often overburdened with computer generated images that make them at times look like video games. The documentary ""Troy: The Passion of Helen,"" is by far the worst of all these documentaries. This fluffy documentary is of limited interest to any history buff. In summary, this DVD set is in dire need of some retooling."
5,"""Traditional"" Creamer","Since Johnson Brothers Willow Blue is an ""open stock"" pattern, you will have to order each piece of this beautiful handpainted porcelain china separately. This Creamer holds a cup of cream, and it matches the ""traditional"" Willow Blue Covered Sugar bowl. It's hard to make a decision between the pretty 3-D sets and the traditional sets, so you might want to buy them both!"
1,Spiteful much Ravi?,This book was strictly created for the financial benefit of Ravi because he didn't get to stay their guitarist. He cashed in on Hanson's fame and if he was REALLY such a wonderful friend of Hanson's then he would have never done such a thing. This book contains photos that I myself found to be an invasion of Hanson's personal lives and I didn't find that cool AT ALL. I suggest not buying this book.
5,This book is hot just like HANSON!,This book is so awesome it shows different stuff and what they do. They show pix that were never seen before which is really awesome! Ravi as got to be the best author in the world. Read this book itz so awesome!
3,Not a Lilac Scent,"While I don't usually like floral scented soaps, I ordered this product because it is supposed to have a lilac scent, which I love. The soap lathers well, is very creamy, and is clearly a quality product, but I take issue with the claim that it smells like lilacs. Before getting it wet, it has a nondescript scent which is somewhat floral, but not lilac. Once it was wet, I smelled it and tried to put a descriptor on the scent. I came up with ""soft cinnamon."""
3,Hollow,"The story of a man who goes west towards the territories so he can start over is plausible, however, the fact he never knew he was gay, isn't. Personally, I couldn't get into this book because it lacked imagination, detail, and characterization. I never really empathized with any of the characters; each of them were two dimensional. Either they were good or they were evil, no middle ground. The fact this book uses mysticism is a shallow ploy to cover poor writing skills. Aside from good grammatical editing, this story had no redeeming value."
2,My Humble Opinion,"I thought the plot was inconsistent and unbelievable, and I did not feel any connection with the characters. Also, I noticed a lot of distracting typos."
2,More lame gay fiction,"I wrote a review of Michael Jensen's Frontiers. Based on my dislike of that poor review, you might wonder why I choose to read this one.Given the state of gay fiction, did I have much choice? The majority of books out there are crap. And, like the Frontiers, at least this wasn't yet ANOTHER piece of gay fiction about a crystal meth snorting screenwriter from NY or LA.The first book was bad. Sterotypical characters, a plot that was derivative. Basically it was a bodice-ripper...or should that be buckskin-ripper.This sequel? It was worse. Totally a ""Scooby-Doo, Old Mr. Potter dressing up to scare everyone away from the gold and it would have worked too if it weren't for you meddling gay frontiersmen who have sex all the time"" story. But I got through it in a couple hours, so it wasn't a huge time suck.Go read something ""Line of Beauty"" Alan Hollinghurst, or the new novel ""The Parts"" by Keith Ridgeway. Don't waste your time with Jensen."
5,"Adventure, mystery, romance!","Firelands is a great adventure story, mystery tale and romance novel rolled into one. The twist is the love interest of frontiersman Cole Seavey, is a Delaware brave named Pakim. The first chapter sets a gripping tone by tapping into a universal fear, that of being consumed alive by a wild animal. The pace doesn't slow til the last page as the two men try to sort out the rumor that the attacks are caused by an ancient menace known to the First Nation's people as the wendigo. Meanwhile, they try to sort out thier realationship.Cole's confusion at his own feelings and the suspicions of local pioneers are handled superbly by this writer. The rich mix of characters is delightful. Beter pay close attention to the turn of events so the ending will make sense!"
4,Frontier gayboy,"This well-paced novel is, yes, a gay frontier love story, set in 1799. Cole Seavey is viciously attacked by what we later find is a wendigo, a beast some previously thought was mythical.Cole is strongly attracted to Pakim, the young Indian who saves him and takes him to the house of John Chapman (from the author's previous gay western novel). The love scenes in the story aren't gratuitous or poorly-inserted porn scenes; they're the result of a natural progression of the characters. While I somewhat felt we were told, more than shown, that Cole was ""cold-hearted Cole"" at least we fully see his gradual change.This is a page-turner that has strong elements of horror and mystery. The town of Hugh's Lick is downright creepy, and the who-is-next factor with the wendigo is chilling. It's an absorbing, engaging read. And kudos to the author for successfully blending genres and providing a fresh environment for a gay story."
3,Very musical,It was amazing in how he sounded like so many famous people.. The problem was it wasn't funny enough not enough humor
5,full of laughter!,Perfect! I first saw this being streamed through netflix. My family watched it severaal times. We knew we had to have it on DVD. :) we're very pleased with our purchase.
2,Not that funny...,"I don't really get what his bit is... All he does is take puppets out and sing popular songs. That only goes so far, you can't just do the same thing several times in a row and expect me to laugh at it. He had a few funny jokes, but most of the act is just singing awkwardly. If you're looking for a good comic who does puppets, just watch Jeff Dunham."
4,Very funny video,If you are a fan of Terry Fator or have heard about him and wanted to check out his shows this is an execellent video.The man is very funny and very talented.
4,Terry Fator DVD,"This product arrived in the promised condition in a timely fashion so that we could enjoy the DVD as a family over the Christmas holiday. Some of the material on the DVD was rather dated (such as the Michael Jackson routine), but it allowed us to recall why we voted so many times to make Terry Fator the champion on ""America's Got Talent""!"
5,FABULOUS DVD!,This DVD was fabulous! Terry Fator & his puppet crew kept the whole family rolling on the floor laughing. Can't wait until he comes out with the next DVD!
5,Fator is Fantastic,"Terry Fator is not just a ventriloquist. He is the consummate entertainer. He does terrific impressions of male and female singers, all performed with his lips not moving. And, he has a great singing voice that he doesn't need a dummy to prove. My 14 year old nephew watched the video over and over. Amazing talent."
3,expected more.........,Expected more with the puppets. Not as family friendly as expected. Would not recommend to anyone else. A big disappointment.
3,Entertaining,"This show is a nice way to spend the time it takes to watch it. I found Terry Fator to be very talented at what he does. But while I found the show very entertaining, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't funnier. I had hoped to laugh considerably more than I did."
1,save your money,I didnt watch Mr Fator on americas got Talent so when this dvd came out all my friends said i should get it. They all said he is just as good as Mr Dunham who i LOVE. so i droke down and brought it. Man was that a waste of money. I watched it 3 Times with all my friends and each time i didnt laugh at all. My friends didnt laugh either. I ended up throwing it out because it sucked so bad. So if you need a laugh get a JEFF DUNHAM dvd instead you will watch it more than this one. I know i do.
2,not what I thought!,"wasnt bad ,just thought it was something else. Terry Fator is very good at what he does. His show is very funny"
5,Terry Fator Live from Las Vegas,Everything about my purchase was great. Video is fantastic - very funny. Service/Mailing was terrific - fast and efficient.
4,Great Show to Watch - Once,"I like Terry Fator. I thought this was great to see his Las Vegas Show!There are some reviews on here that object to the sexual innuendos. To those folks I say, he's doing Las Vegas, not Sesame Street or prime time TV. So, if you fear you or your guests might be offended by some ""very light"" sexual innuendos , don't watch this Blu Ray Disc."
5,Terry Fator: Live from Las Vegas,We have absolutely loved this DVD. It is hilarious. My husband has shared it with everyone in his family and given 2 away. We only wish there were more out there. Unfortunately this is the only one Terry has on the market.
5,FABULOUSLY FUNNY,This mans extraordinary talent keeps you hilariously entertained from beginning to end. Recommend this to everyone who enjoys ventriloquism and fun!!
4,A true genius,"Terry Fator is absolutely amazing to watch. He can sing pretty darn well on his own but when he sings through his puppets the magic really happens. Seriously... the guy has his mouth nearly closed and he can still do impressions better than most normal impressionists! There's only a little adult humor in the DVD so overall it's family friendly. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to watch a great show.As to the DVD itself, I wish they could have kept on one camera view for longer than two seconds. The constant jumping around is more than a little annoying. I am rating the DVD based on the quality of the recording, not on Terry himself!"
4,An Awesome Performance!!!,"Terry Fator is an awesome performer, and extremely talented! He gives life to his characters who are incredibly funny. Terry is just as good as Jeff Dunham. Some of his characters are a cowboy named Walter T. Airedale, Winston the Impersonating Turtle, Maynard Tompkins is an Elvis impersonator who does not know any Elvis songs, Julius is an African American who sings 'Soul' Vicky the Cougar is a 49-year-old who loves younger men, and finally you have Terry's annoying neighbor named Dougie Scott Walker who loves to party. Terry also does an awesome Michael Jackson spoof, and takes a man from his audience and turns him into a Cher puppet. If you love ventriloquists, singing, and impersonations, I highly recommend TERRY FATOR: LIVE FROM LAS VEGAS!!!"
5,Terry Fator Live From Las Vegas,This has to be the most talented person ventriloquist I've ever seen. Talented and versitle. The way he can switch voices so quickly is amazing. He deserved every penny of the million dollars he won on America's Got Talent! I watch this repeatedly and enjoy it every single time!
5,Best ventriloquist EVER,"I watched Terry Fator on America's Got Talent and told myself that if he didn't win, I would never watch that show again. He won, and I've watched the show since, but have never seen ANYONE come even close to the talent displayed by Terry Fator. His characters are fun and his interaction with them believable. I have seen Terry's show in person in Las Vegas and have also met him. He is an extremely personable man, and very humble, an absolute pleasure to talk to. Where else can you find such varied talents coupled with genuine down-home humility? Makes Jeff Dunham look like an arrogant amateur! Buy this DVD. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Terry Factor Live from Las Vegas,I enjoyed Terry Factor's show in Las Vegas. This dvd is practicaly the same as the show and is as enjoyable.
5,Terry Fator,"I saw Terry Fator on America's Got Talent and was thrilled he won (not only is he talented, he's a Texas native). I was thrilled when I heard this DVD was coming out because I didn't know if I would ever get to Vegas to see his show. I was not disappointed. I have already watched it several times and love it!"
5,A FUN DVD,This comedian is very good and the disc is a good value for the money and the material is first rate. recommend this to all who like to laugh and is PG in my opinion.
5,happy as a lark,"we really enjoy this movies,,its so funny,we enjoy movies like this,specailly in the north theres nothing else to do but watch a movie,thanks"
3,Terry Fator,"I bought this DVD for my husband for Christmas--I had watched this man when he was on America's Got Talent and thought it would be a cute DVD to have. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good as some of the stuff he did on AGT so we were a little disappointed. However, Terry Fator is a very talented ventriloquist and I love the range of his voice."
5,terry fator live in las vegas,It was laugh out loud funny and very entertaining. We have watched it twice now and just loved it. Can't wait for the next one to come out.
5,Terry Fator is HILARIOUS!,My husband and I watched America's Got Talent the year Terry was on there and we rooted for him the entire time. He is so incredibly talented and entertaining. This movie is a great buy!
3,His performance on AGT was better,"I remember being gobsmacked by Terry's performance on America's Got Talent, and was expecting a similar caliber of performance in this video. It's not bad, it just doesn't live up to the AGT performances. There are a few routines he uses from his career before AGT, and some new ones, but the performance quality just isn't as good."
5,Hilarious...,My husband absoluely loved this video and will watch it many times. Can't wait for our friends to see it.
5,Terry Fator,This dvd came in perfect condition and is an excellent dvd to watch over and over again. Terry Fator is an excellent ventriloquist.
5,"Funny funny, funny",Wow - he just keeps getting better and better. Way to Terry and Amazon - you're a team!
5,amazing,Just amazing...The singing is outstanding...we have passed this DVD to all family members and also co-workers...not one bad review. We can't wait for his next DVD.
5,Awesome!!!!,"We just received and watched this DVD and it is absolutely the best. I have loved Terry and voted weekly for him on America's Got Talent 2 years ago, and he has just gotten better & better. This is worth alot more than what I purchased it for. Best money I ever spent for a DVD."
3,a little disappointed,"I love Terry Fator. I think he is one of the best entertainers ever. I bought this DVD because I thought it would be great family entertainment. It has some content that is not appropriate for children, and I really don't need to hear that stuff, either. His performance choices on America's Talent were much better."
3,"Somewhat entertaining, but WAY TOO MUCH SINGING.","Yeah, I get it, you can make your puppets sing, but it gets extremely old after the first 15 minutes. I'd much rather watch one of Jeff Dunham's videos. His wit is clever and fresh. I didn't watch the whole thing because there was just too much singing, and it was a FREE streaming video with Amazon Prime. Just not my cup of tea."
2,Extremely uncomfortable,"I didn't try it myself but bought it for my mom who had jsut had hip replacement surgery. She said it made her feel unsteady and was very uncomfortable, she didnt like it at all and we sent it back. It did work fine though. Maybe for someone with a smaller behind? Does seem you really have to be on a firmer chair - soft chairs don't work well with it."
2,great concept-poor performance,"I bought this for my father who has a difficult time getting out of his recliner. He liked it at first but the bar that you use to adjust the weignt, and thus the reponse of the seat, kept coming out of the slot making it even more difficult to get up because it wouldn't lift art all. Apparently this product can not be returned for a refund if it has been opened so beware of making the purchase."
1,seat assist,"Way too expensive, it doesn't work on all chairs,doesn't work on my computer chair for example, won't work on sofas,recliners,or armchairs. And after one hour sitting on it, feels uncomfotable. You also have to make sure you're holding the side of the chair when you get up, or you might lose your balance, and it's easy to forget about that."
4,Performs as advertised,"Chair performs as advertised. Just puts you three or four inches higher than normal, which takes your feet off the ground, unless you are extremely tall."
1,Winesceptre Wine Chilling System,"Not worth the money. Does not keep the wine chilled, definitely cannot replace a wine ice bucket."
1,Cover is deceiving!!,"I don't recommend this book at all. My son is very much into finding hidden pictures and this is one of the most boring books I've seen. The cover makes it look like it is colorful, but it has a total of two colors throughout the whole book...purple and green. Ugh! It is hideous! Honestly, some of the activities look like they could be fun, but the lack of colors just puts me off enough that I wish I hadn't spent my money on it. I will be looking for a better book."
1,Good for little kids maybe,"This book is rated for kids 9 - 12 so I bought it for my 10 yr old. WAY too easy, just a few things on each page, and overall a disappointment. This would be appropriate for a 5-7 year old. I'm very disappointed."
5,Part of My Pirate Library,"This is probably my second favorite book on pirates (Under the Black Flag by David Cordingly is first on my list). However, this is a high quality overview of the history of pirates from earliest recorded times onward. Konstam breaks it down by era, from the ancient world on, with discussion of the periods, famous names and regions.While the textual content is well written and researched. the graphic content is probably even more impressive. The inclusion of maps and period images make this an entertaining as well as informative read. P-)"
5,A very well rounded review of pirate biographies,"This book is heavy on the illustrations. That being said, it is NOT necessarily light on information.In particular, I was VERY pleased with how well balanced the very subject of pirate biographies was treated. There are sections of the book dedicated to each major geographical region, as well as to different time periods.It lightly glosses over the subjects of ships, weaponry, practices, flags, and strongholds (for better coverage of these things, try Benerson Little's Sea Rover's Practice), but gives a great deal of general biographical information on many different famous pirates from the Indian Ocean, Far East, Caribbean, and even on back into the ""Ancient World.""For general reference in a well-balanced delivery, with plenty of attention given to other-than-Caribbean and other-than-late-17th-century piracy, I recommend no other book more."
3,A fun introduction,This book is an enjoyable and easy to read introduction to the personalities and history of piracy throughout the world. It gives you a fun insight into the time periods and fates of many of the prominent personalities.
3,"Except for the ""Chinaman"" reference on p. 173, it was o.k.","I don't care if that's how Chinese were referred to back then, try substituting any hateful racial reference for that word and see how it reads."
3,I thought this would have more places to see,"and less festivals and such. I wanted places that I could visit any time, not just at certain times of the year. It does have some interesting things in it, but not enough of what I was looking for."
4,Eccentric America 2nd,Fun Read. A friend and I are taking a cross country trip.Wanted to check out some of the odd things out there along the way.Well organized with tons of things to see along the way.We may not want to return home.Who can resist the Spam Museum or the Biggest Ball of Twine ! LOL
3,Mixed feelings,"This bank is great if you don't plan on opening it often (or don't want it opened by you children!). The lock doesn't work very smoothly, and usually doesn't open on the 1st try. It also does not recognize $1 coins. Counts them as quarters. Otherwise it is a great concept, and has taught my children that there needs to be money IN an ATM before it can be taken out and used. Both my children also like that they can quickly see how much money they have saved."
2,Not what is advertised at all!!!!,"I bought three of these from two different stores. All three shared the same problem: they do NOT do what they are advertised as doing. First, in the instructions included in the box, it says the ATM says 'Hi, and welcome back'. Not one of the twelve in the store did that, as did not the three I bought hoping to find a good one. Further, not ONE of the three would recognize a bill had been inserted, OR even let you add a bill using the 'bill' buttons on the top. My son and I both were thrilled with the IDEA of such a product, which is why it got two stars....for performance, it gets none."
2,Not great for older kids,I bought this ATM today and was little disappointed. It was really annoying. Everytime you push a button it makes a weird spacy sound. You don't need a PIN number like a real ATM. The combo is difficult to turn and you can't change it when your sister finds out the number. The dollar amount is hard to enter. It's not like the directions. I really wanted something more like a real ATM. I recommend this toy for kids between 5 through 9 (I'm 11).
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!,This is the most frustrating and horid bank I have ever bought in my life! The combination is very hard to figure out how to use and after about one month the dollar inserting slot stopped counting dollars... NOW I HAVE TO PUT IN QUARTER AFTER QUARTER TO PUT IN THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS I WANT TO! Don't waist you money... find something else because this product is a useless piece of junk!
2,BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!!,i got this cause i wanted to keep track of my money it worked well until like two months later whenever i turn it on it goes straight to deposit and it wont let me deposit n e thing i still kept my money in it but one time i tried to open the door(you have to do the code like five times befor it opens)and it fell off i would recomend n e thing but this one!!!!
1,Not worth the money,We purchased this for my son who was wanting an electronic bank. This was our second try as the first one we returned. Our son has not been happy with this one either. It does not count the money correctly and cannot be used to truly track your money to save. I've given up trying to find something that works well to help children really learn about saving money and is more modern like todays ATM's. Back to the piggy-bank!
5,ATM Savings Bank,My daughter enjoys her new bank. It teaches her how to use an ATM and helps her to keep an accurate count of her money
2,Doesn't Work Well,"This ATM Bank was OK but it only lasted about half a day! It should be returned because it doesn't work very well at all. After using only a few times, it thought every coin was a dime. It quit for awhile and didn't do anything at all, then it wouldn't allow me to see the balance. I advise you NOT to buy this product. It's fun but disappointing in the end."
2,BAD ATM,DO NOT BUY THIS! I bought it and about a month the display went blank and the feeder didn't work and it wouldn't detect the bills. and you cant store any bill over 20$ GET SOMETHING ELSE!
2,broke too soon...,"My son loved it, it was great at the start. But then the trouble started, batteries died, balance never matched, the bill feeder broke, atm card got lost, finally the combination lock broke. It just wasn't worth the money."
4,Great Toy - Money well spent,"I bought the ATM for my 11 yr old daughter and she loves it! Its a great way for her to save her allowance money. She puts money in each day and is thrilled to see it increase when she checks her balance. She loves that her information is kept ""secret"" and only she can check it. She and her friends play with this toy more than they do any other. They pretend to be bankers, play house, go to the ATM before they go ""shopping"" and she keeps her credit card in her wallet at all times. When I bought the toy, the girl told me their was a bigger, better version of this ATM and it was supposedly a sell out item. I beleive it has many more functions and capabilities. Depends on how much money you want to spend. Its a great toy. Money was well spent!"
1,ATM MAchine,This ATM Machine is really bad. DONT GET IT! all it does is says how much money you have. you put in money then put how much money you put in and it adds to your total. to get money out open vault. (code on bottom) if you want a good atm machine get the talking atm machine at toyrus for only $29.99!!!!
3,"Sociology, not theology","I bought this book expecting to get a healthy dose of sociology along with some seriouse theological reflection on the sociological data. I was wrong. In my opinion this book was too heavy on sociology and too lite on theology. If Clark would've spent more time connecting the sociological conclusions to theological implications, the book would've been a gem."
3,Too technical for me as a lay person,"While I have no doubt of the value of this book or the qualifications of the author to write it, it was beyond my ability to finish. Had I been buying at a brick-and-mortar store, I would have realized this was not as appropriate for the lay person as I had hoped."
2,does not deliver,"Perhaps when this book was first published,the information presented was seen as new, but I don't think that is the case today. I was expecting some ""eye openers"" or at the very least some innovative suggestions on how to deal with the issues presented, but I found none of those. Quite the opposite, I found myself wondering if the author had spent any time at all around teenagers before embarking on his study. He seemed to just rehash and even sensationalize the issues of self-esteem, perceived abandonment, emerging sexuality and pressures to perform and succeed that teenagers face. If you have no experience with adolescents, this book may be helpful to you. However, if you work with or around teenagers, you should be able to write this book yourself, and shame on you if you can't!"
5,Who doesn't like Cilantro?,"I have tried all of these nuts and they are fantastic. I highly recommend them as a snack which is not only healthy, but tasty. If you don't like cilantro try all the other great flavors."
3,"Beautiful set, not sturdy.","We bought this for our daughter. Loved it! Beautiful. Was warned to be very gentle putting it together - we did and didn't split any of the pieces. On day #1, the table was scooted a bit to make room for something and one of the legs splintered - wobbly leg now, which cannot be fixed. Now, every time the kiddo pushes on the table the least little bit, we have to re-stabilize the leg to keep it from falling off. Recommend being very careful - make sure to pick it up to move it. We've grown weary of trying to keep it together (we've had it about 2 months), so we're simply going to look for something different."
2,Worked for a little while.,"I bought this table and chairs for my daughter when she was two. Good size for children. We were happy with it till the planks on the chairs started falling off. Tried wood glue, small nails, nothing would hold them together. With in a few months all the wood planks and support pieces on the bottom had fallen apart. My daughter hurt her self a few time before I just ended up throwing it out. We had it for a total of a year."
4,Dramatic and comedic moments mixed,"Although Zach's character is obnoxious and always doing or saying the wrong thing, you can't help but feel for him since he has just lost his dad. And you will also have mixed feelings towards Downey's character, who wants to be with his about-to-deliver wife but who also could find better ways of dealing with people rather than antagonizing them. There is also a funny little dog along for the adventure as this road trip goes along.Funny yet touching."
2,Probably funny on paper,"The acting seemed to me to be ""mailed in"". I really like both of the actors in this movie. And to describe some of the scenes to my friends, you would think it was a hilarious movie. So I'm pretty sure the writing was good, but the execution was off. The timing and the passion never seemed to click. Maybe having Downey Jr. as the straight guy was the problem. He seemed more mean that funny. Mean can be funny if given proper attention - Dr. Evil is quite funny, but he was vulnerable too. Downey's vulnerable side seemed fake so you never really cared about the character. Comedy is surely one of the hardest forms of acting to capture on film - you really have to commit to the character and the scene. This movie and the actors never really did that. There were a few funny moments, but in all it was a rather dull ride. What a shame. I really wanted to like this movie. Two popular actors cashing a check. That's all."
2,Eh......,"Not the best story, chemistry between the two characters was just OK.Wouldn't waste my time watching it again."
1,Lost Student,"The writer and/or director and/or actors were once students in my school but dropped out in 9th grade due to heavy doses of self love and other drugs. These class comedians who continue to thrive on attention and I'm pleased to see successful at maintaining their narcissistic sense of humor (well, maybe humor to someone) now have a pool and BMW to show for their lack of effort.Oh, and movies of mismatched characters with less than redeeming personalities being fatefully tossed together and ending up better for it has been reduxed endlessly. Nothing new nor funny in this one but nice ""borrowing""."
2,Poor,"Product was marketed as new, but arrived with no packaging and a scratch across the back of the DVD. Very disappointed."
3,Solid,"Overall, this movie really does deserve 3 very solid stars.....it's pretty good. Yes, I was thinking it'd have the ""magic"" that ""The Hangover"" had (it didn't)....but that was unfair of me to expect that.Overall, is watching this more fun that having a Brazilian bikini wax? Yeah, probably it is."
3,"Okay, better to rent","the movie was an okay movie, it had some funny parts in it. And the idea that they would make it that far on that little amount of money is unbelievable. The sleeping in the car sene was a little disturbing though."
3,It was okay,The movie was good. Sometimes funny. Sometime lapses that were boring throughout the movie. Definitely low-priced rental. Should only be watched one time.
2,Not recommended,"Could have been funny, but it was mostly just sad. I expected more from RDJ, and ZG is not my favorite."
1,"I don't ""get"" this genre of movies","UGH this movie. It was awful! Way too many parts just made me groan. It's not even ""gross me out and farting boys"" humor - it's just bad overall and just not very funny at all. I stopped the movie at some point - too hard to watch because I was just hating it. I had some work around the house to do so I just put it on as background noise and would look up once in a while; just so I didn't feel like I totally wasted my money. I'm SO happy I did NOT see it at the theaters!"
4,Anything is funny on a graveyard shift,Decent movie. I enjoyed it and will probably watch it again. RBD is the classic jerk that he plays so well and Zach G. is just as goofy and silly as ever. Pretty much exactly what I expected from them teaming up.
5,Great movie,I laughed throughout this whole movie. It is just a feel good movie. A great pick me up. Great storyline.
2,Predictable,Let me say up front that I don't generally care for brainless comedy. This was so predictable I could have sworn I had seen it before.
1,What a stinker!,"There is nothing entertaining, or uplifting, or laughter-inducing about this stinker of a flick.It's not even worth my time to ""review"" this sorry piece of trash. I am writing this to warn everyone not waste their time or money on this."
1,This movie really sucks,"We didn't find anything funny in this movie. Any scenes that were remotely funny were all shown in the movie trailers on t.v. Our conversations after watching this film on DVD were basically this: ""How did Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Fox ever get talked into making this bomb?"" and ""Did Downey and Fox owe someone a big favor and this was how they had to pay it back?"" This movie SUCKED."
3,"More Heart than Laughs, but Not Enough of Either","I have to start off by saying that I own, and do enjoy this film, despite my less than favorable rating. Also, I love some of Todd Phillips's other films, Old School and The Hangover. I also enjoy Starsky & Hutch for the most part. This movie will be great to people who can ignore how much of it has already been done in other road trip comedies. I even saw things ripped directly out of Todd Phillip's last movie. I love the cast, and honestly, they're the main reason that I can re-visit this film for repeat viewings. Zach Galafianakis is always a pleasure, to me at least, and I really enjoy Robert Downey Jr. in just about everything he does. Problem is that Due Date seemed to not have much effort put into it, but luckily the cast cared enough to make up for it. Otherwise, it's sure to get a handful of laughs, especially if you didn't see the trailers a hundred times. I definitely recommend Due Date to fans of the cast, and fans of Todd Phillips."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"From the writer, director, and star of the Hangover, aka the funniest movie I've ever seen, comes Due Date! I can't tell you how excited I was to see this film. Unfortunately, if you've seen the preview, you've seen all the funny parts. Robert Downy is great as the moody, uptight, Peter. Zach Galifianakis however, was pretty bland. Metro-sexual Ethan didn't have the same shock value and loveable loser quality as Alan did, I didn't find him funny, I just felt sorry for him. The plot didn't help the film much either. How many times have you seen two strangers, thrown together by happenstance taking a road trip together? Due Date was OK, but it's been done, and they made the rookie mistake of putting everything good into the preview. Despite the great cast, I say pass on this one."
2,OVERHYPED AND 2 GOOD STARS COULDN'T SAVE THIS MESS,"Please- save your $ and buy something else with a better rating with either of these stars.It was not especially funny except for a handful of scenes.(The dog should be given credit for the cute factor. Cream colored Frenchie named Sonny)We thought they tried to make this like the movie : TRAINS -PLANES AND AUTOMOBILES- which was a GOOD movie, but this road trip felt like it never really went anywhere.Simple storyline:Downey has to get back home to his very , due any moment, pregnant wife and time is running out.That is it.The rest is a mad rush with the two characters using any means of transport to get Downey back to the hospital in time.The simple premise could be forgiven if only the movie had been truly entertaining- which it wasn't.I am a fan of the stars of this movie- but not even that will change my 2 star rating :-("
1,Doo Date,"Reviews Of Unusual Size!Re: Headed to Los Angeles for his baby's birth, RDJ gets kicked off of the plane and put on the no-fly list thanks to a grating, bearded stranger. Broke and desperate, he ends up getting a ride across the country with the man and his small dog.Outstanding: It was fun seeing Michelle Monaghan and RDJ in the same movie. It reminded me of Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang - a movie I loved. Even when he's working with a movie like this, Downey Jr. remains watchable.Unacceptable: The jokes were strained and unfunny and there were so many loose ends I started to think there wasn't a rope. Gross out comedy has taken the place of wit.Summary: Hidden beneath the bad jokes and pointless cameos, there's a good movie about loss and friendship, but it's not worth finding.1/5"
1,"Strictly ""guy"" humor. And annoying.",Love RDjr and so wish he hadn't been trapped in this film with a foil whose character is so unappealing you can only pray the movie will end. Don't personally know a woman who would watch it to the end.
1,Oh my...,"The only movie I ever turned off before finishing was ""RetarDead"" but that was expected from a sequel to ""Monsturd"". I really had high hopes for this movie but 20 minutes into, I simply couldn't take it anymore. It was horrible!!! Zach was way too obnoxious to digest and his jokes were forced and utterly stupid and not even Robert Downey Jr. could save it. The only scene that I was actually laughing was the ""take care of my kids for awhile"" scene with RDJr but after 10 more minutes... that was it. I've read other reviews that say the movie doesn't get any better after 20-25 minutes so I feel good I didn't waste my time finishing it."
1,skip this one...why...,Crass and stupid! There are some scenes that were good...the best that I remember was when Robert D.'s character was sitting on the plane and the goof ball was trying to get his luggage in the over bin and when they were on the road and they stopped for grass. What he did to the boy was hysterical! The kid had it coming. The masturbation with the goof ball and the dog was low class. After that I could not waste my time. If you want a stupid and crass film this one is for you.
1,One of the worst movies of the year!,"Due Date is an extremely boring movie. I'm really surprised that anyone could find it funny. I laughed once, and only a little, during the whole 95 minutes. That's not very much, really. But then I don't find it funny if someone masturbates in his car and is imitated by his dog.The rhythm is slow and uninspired, the acting rather pointless. I felt sorry for Robert Downey Jr who would have deserved better. I never thought I would have to see another movie where a guy carries his father's ashes in a coffee box and in the end even coffee is made from the ashes. How low can you get?Theres is nothing that can be said in favor of this movie. It is just terrible, insipid, terribly boring and very badly directed and acted. I'm sorry to say...So if you don't want to ruin your evening like I did, avoid it.There are so many better movies out there, worth to be watched!"
4,"The Modern ""Trains Planes and Automobiles""","Very Funny!This movie is the new version of ""Trains Planes and Automobiles"". An Architect plans to travel to Los Angeles to be next to his wife on her due date. He encounters a very goofy guy in the airport not knowing that he will later accompany him in the the craziest adventure on the roach to Los Angeles.Has lots of funny moments. Don't compare it to the Hangover, its an entirely different story."
3,More Raunch than Laughs,"Years after Trains, Planes, and Automobiles we again have two very funny actors, in this case Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis, thrown together by happenstance in a road movie with back stories. Due Date, for me, is by far the lesser of the two. I suppose one could watch them back to back and ponder the societal changes that have gone down in the intervening quarter century as reflected in what's acceptable fare on the screen. Instead, I personally spent most of the last half hour of the movie wondering if our border crossings with Mexico had become so lax that an obviously stolen vehicle, driven by two people without ID, can get so easily into the United States. That puzzle replaced the earlier bemusement at how two people could survive an obviously fatal crash with only minor injuries. Due Date has some laughs, no doubt about that, but too many of them are tinged with sadism and antic though the plot is, it is ultimately not all that engaging."
5,"Automobiles, Planes, and Automobiles!","I was all set for a chick flick. But.. it is not! Good news ...This movie was all out funny from start to finish. Lots of great laughs. Not juvenile, Will Ferrell stuff either. Best of Odd Couple. Great acting. Great screenplay. Great direction. Terrible title. Pregnancy.. babies.. NOTHING to do with the story -- and thats the good news for us guys.. Sorry ladies."
4,;0),"I like this movie, if your familiar with Zach's comedic work in movies then you basically have an idea how the movie is, I think Zach always plays the same characters in his movies he needs to change it up a bit real soon I don't want to get tired of it. While the storyline might seem weak and silly at times it was still ok for me and funny to watch, I love Rorbet Downey's comedic side I think he is funny in a serious way. Spoiler maybe******** love the part with Jamie fox, Robert and Zach drinking the so call coffee lol. This is the type of movie you can sit and watch with your friends to have a good laugh."
3,due date,"the movie was o.k.! it wasn't as good as i expected! i was hoping it would be as good as hangover, maybee my expectation's were to high!!!"
3,Just OK,"As the title says, it was just OK and I actually ejected it a couple of times forbetter movies and have not finished it.I kept looking around for John Candy............"
2,This is funny?,"I watched half of this film and couldn't make it past that point. The whole time I was watching I kept waiting to laugh. This is a comedy? Most of the events that happened were odd, but not really that interesting. The very few attempts at humor often fell flat, with only a small side-joke actually making me break out into a light chuckle. I recommend that in place of this film you watch either Sherlock Holmes or The Hangover. Both films contain one star from this film but are actually entertaining films."
4,"Great comedy, with a good story","If you are looking for a really funny movie then this is a no-brainer. What it lacks in depth it more than makes up for with laughs. Although there is some character development along the way it is not the highlight of the film. Galifianakis and Downey Jr. make for a great ""odd couple"" pairing which creates some of the movies best moments. The film doesn't take itself too seriously and I think that it's a solid movie that can be watched multiple times without getting too stale."
3,"Funny movie, but not what I expected.","I watched this movie hoping it would be like Trains, Planes, and Automobiles, but it wasn't. There were some similar scenes. I thought it was funny, but there were some immature jokes."
5,Awesome Film!,"RDJ is magnificent, as always. They both worked well off each other! I rented this movie, but now that I've seen it, I'm going to buy it. I felt so bad for RDJ's character, getting hurt throughout the film, but the other guy was so oblivious to things, it was hilarious. Simply fantastic flick."
4,"PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES/ GOOD TO THE LAST DROP","Two incompatible men are forced to cross country with each other, sometimes on limited funds. Robert Downey jr. plays a architect who is a bit of a snob. Zach Galifanakis, is a common man with dreams of being a movie star. He is a fan of ""2 1/2 Men"" and like a child, or my last gf, sometimes doesn't realize or care about the consequence of his actions. The movie is laugh out loud funny. I didn't think that it measured up to the original PT&A, simply because Downey's character was far less colorful than Steve Martin. The movie was written to showcase Zach Galifanakis. I thought it was better than ""The Hangover"" in that it excludes the abundance of sophomoric humor. No nudity or sex. Contains language, masturbation, and pot smoking."
2,Paging The Laugh Doctor. Patient Is Critically Unfunny.,"""Due Date"" attempts to be a raunchier version of ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"". It succeeds in being raunchy but lacks the wit and ingenuity of John Hughes' film. Zach Galifianakis absolutely flounders here. Don't get me wrong. I think Galafianakis is a real comic find with his work in the ""Hangover"" movies and ""Dinner for Schmucks"". He could be the next John Candy but here he seems to be channeling Chris Elliott or, even worse, Tom Green. Robert Downey Jr. is left with egg on his face playing straightman to Galifianakis' pathetic antics. What keeps me from giving this one star is the occasional laugh notably a scene at the Western Union station. Regardless, a waste of time. Director Todd Phillips must have had a hangover between ""Hangover"" movies."
5,Funny well worth a watch,The film is very funny I laughed out loud a number of times which many comedies don't do. The chemistry between the main actors at times is up there with the best!
5,Like new,all it needed was the price tag. Both the box and CD were in great condition. I was very happy with the quality and it's quick delivery. Will definitely buy more!
2,Tehnical Director,What can I say. The best part of the movie was already shown in the theater trailers. Not worth the price.
1,Disgusting,"I have enjoyed some of the recent comedies like The Hangover and Bridesmaids, but this movie was so awful, I couldn't finish it. Some things just aren't funny to me, and some movies just go too far with the gross-out humor. I assume that if I had continued past the scene where the two guys spend the night in the car with the dog (you know what I'm talking about), other funny scenes might have redeemed the movie. Maybe if I'd been in a movie theater, it would have seemed funnier?"
1,Horrible and frustrating.,The only part that this movie makes you react is that you feel as frustrated and irritated as the caracter played by Downey Jr. It is a really bad movie.
2,A steaming turd pile of a movie,1.5 starsSure it has its moments but it's just not very realistic nor well-written...Zach Galifinakis is funny as a stand-up comedian but the script he's given just seems really contrived...The best part is the ending when he has a supporting role on 2&1/2 Men...And I'm so tired of these generic stereotypes of pot smokers and what it's like to be stoned...
1,Horrid,"Many of the other negative reviewers have tapped in to my feelings exactly - a complete waste of time. With actors like these two, it is almost impossible to believe something *funny* could not have been made. Even something REMOTELY funny.My initial thought was that it was a sad attempt at recreating Planes, Trains and Automobiles... without the warmth or humor.Awful."
1,Worst Movie Ever #17,"Well, I basically rented the movie, because I like the guy from hang over. It also said the movie was done by the same producers, but this movie is just stupid.Save the time and do something else"
1,bad to worse to even worse,"I am about half way through this god awful movie, I don't believe that Robert downey made such a slooooooooooow, crappy flick. I bought this based on the quality of the actors, obviously I was wrong to do that, save your money and time and watch something else. Anything else."
1,Horrible Movie!,"This was just a horrible movie. I rented it and returned it right after. This movie was not even funny. It was over commercialized to make it seem more funny than what it really is. Everything about this movie was just bad. The script, plot, and comedy was just horrible. It was too predictable and nothing really worked."
1,"Two great actors, one terrible movie",I'm a big fan of both Robert Downey Jr and Zach Galifianakis. Unfortunately this is a terrible movie. Just a long string of unrealistic and shocking but not really funny bits. It's essentially a bad remake of Planes Trains and Automobiles with Steve Martin and John Candy on steroids. But they lost any likabiity or chemistry between the characters. It was so painful I skipped over the last 30 minutes of the movie to the last five minutes. Didn't look like it got any better.
5,wow! one of the best ones I've seen lately,I did not think at all that I will finish it the way it started but was I wrong. It is awesome and funny movie! The conversation is hillarious and things that happen made me laugh! didn't think I would enjoy it but it was awesome! Time well spent!
3,Funny if you suspend total believability!,"First, I really like Downey as an actor - he can be as serious or as corny as they come (like in Tropic Thunder) and be good either way. He basically mailed this role in - there's nothing here that stretched him as an actor in any way but he's still better mailing it in than most actors trying their best. There's some really funny moments in the film and his ""buddy"" interaction works for the most part. However, to enjoy this movie, you have to totally dismiss any connection to reality and forgot how lame the story really is. I will mention ONE scene that totally blows it - Downey calls his friend (Fox) to help him out and is given money and car to DRIVE rest of the way. Now, given his circumstances and urgent need to get to his wife AND his hate for the forced roadmate, WHY THE HECK DIDN""T HE JUST FLY REST OF THE WAY?"
2,So Difficult to Rate,"Hey You...This movie is funny and I hate to rate it at 2 if only I could add 2.75. I laughed and sometimes felt should I be laughing at a very scary and realistic situation. When you watch the film be mindful, it takes time to switch geers from seeing the perspective of Pee Wee's Large Marge grand adventure or John Candy's devil to Steve Martin and ending up with the semi-truck escapade. Zach Galifianakis is hilarious. Robert Downey Jr. needs to lighten up for he can be mean. However, if you don't laugh you may appreciate the soundtrack for there are several great songs from Pink Floyd to Rod Steward. Rod plays an astoudning chord of Amazing Grace."
2,Didn't like this movie,"I was hesitant to see this movie. I got the feeling all the good bits were in the previews. And they were. However they seemed a lot funnier in the previews than in the actual movie. My husband and I considered stopping the movie on many occasions, but somehow we did manage to watch it the end, in hopes it would get better. It really did not. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Average at best,"So played. Half assed comedy & half assed drama - failed at both. Jamie Fox's cameo/storyline retarded.Any fan of Zach G. will be disappointed, but I'm glad he got a paycheck."
4,Great movie but DVD version was a FAIL.,"Hilarious movie! Lots of special features and great picture on BluRay, BUT my DVD version was corrupted. Halfway through the movie the DVD was unplayable and skips about 15 minutes, it wasnt my DVD player cause it also didnt work on my PS3. Too late to return now."
2,...it's okay,"It's not as funny as Hangover many things seem recycled from that movie not to mention other movies. In this movie Zach Galifianakis, like in Hangover, plays a sort of lonely sad idiot who seems to have no friends, has a penchant for drugs, gets other people in trouble, and then makes them want to kill him and at the end of the movie somehow, for some reason they (or in this case him, Robert Downey Jr's character) forgive him. There other similarities that I don't want to give away. Anyway, I just found it mostly boring. There might have been maybe a few laughs here and there but it mostly seemed boring, recycled and unfunny to me but, hey judging by the number of positive reviews chance are you might like it. If you liked Hangover you MIGHT like this one. A couple of beers...or whatever could possibly help you enjoy this film even more but chances are if you didn't like the Hangover then you won't like this one..."
3,Due Date is a solid take on nevertheless well worn material.,"If you've seen Trains, Planes, and Automobiles, you don't need to see this movie. The former is a John Hughes classic with comedy legends Steve Martin and John Candy. The plots of the films are more similar than a lot of recent official remakes. I liken this to Red Dragon, a completely competent if unnecessary remake of the good film Manhunter. Stars Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis put in great work in their respective mostly dramatic and mostly comedic roles. But the road trip movie has been done to death, and even people who've never heard of TV Tropes will find most events and character turns in the film predictable. The film was solidly directed, and there are some beautiful landscape shots. Due Date will probably draw in fans of the Hangover, but this story is nowhere near as outrageous, and it feels much more like a lost, just 'okay' 1980s road movie."
3,Reminds Me of Another Film,"And that film was ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", the John Candy/Steve Martin vehicle. However, that film was funny (hilarious in spots) and very enjoyable to watch.'Due Date' stars Robert Downey, Jr. as Peter Highland, a man whose wife is about to give birth. He's across the country in Atlanta, and the movie details all the trouble he runs into just trying to fly back to the left coast (LA). He runs intoEthan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) who is one bad luck charm just waiting to ruin your day (and your trip).The resemblance to 'Planes...' is enough to periodically compare the two at different points of the film. Due Date suffers in comparison, unless you are looking for a dark comedy to watch for an hour-and-a half.I give the movie three stars. I have no desire to watch the film again, but it was dark enough and gross enough to satisfy a bit of curiosity about the film."
3,Movie was OK,The movie was OK. I expected better. It wasn't all I expected it to be. It wasn't all that funny.I would definitely do business again with the seller. Product came fast without encountering any issues.Movie rating: 3/5
2,Recondidtioned Rowenta Iron,I am disatisfied with this iron because when I tip it up to put waterin it it drips out the bottom also when I set it on its heel.
5,I feel more secure.,I commute to the office a couple days per week by bike. When I start out it is dark and that may last until I get to my destination depending on the time of year. This reflective vest with the built in LED lights down the back helps me feel much more secure about riding in the dark. The thing is so light I don't even know I have it on. I would recommend this to any runner/biker that want's to improve his/her visibility to cars on the road.
3,5 stars + 5 stars = 3 stars,I admire both musicians in this colaboration album. Their individual styles have exerted an impact on the ambient genre. They both brought their distinct personal asthetic tone to this SoMa CD. And the project as a whole is satisfying. Yet the imaginativeness and charged expression lack luster. That Robert Rich sublime tension and mystery is not evident. And Roach's synthguitar sounds reduced. In short one would imagine a more fulfilling less overproduced offering from these two ambient masters.
4,"So far, so good...","The supplements came quickly, the price was excellent, and the shipping was free. All in all a good experience.As far as how well the supplements work....who knows!?! Like most supplements, you don't get some immediate, noticeable response. If I got some outstanding, immediate response, I would have given them five stars and be typing in all caps!"
1,Possible Fire Hazard - Don't Buy This!,"My son loved this for the first six weeks. Then it shorted out, and the batteries got so hot that they melted the inside of the case. The manufacturer constructed it so that the main wires leading from the battery compartment to the door of the safe get caught when the door closes. The insulation on the wires quickly wears away until the hot wires are exposed.If you own one, be very careful! This ended in the trash."
2,breaks too easily,"I bought two as Christmas gifts for the kids, and on one, the plastic piece holding the hinge together broke even before we cut it out of the plastic, and the other broke when the boys were opening and closing it repeatedly to make the alarm sound (not sure how rough they were, but we weren't amused that it broke so easily!).I was going to replace them, but I think I will return the one that they didn't break themselves, and look for a sturdier one. I'm pretty sure a replacement would break again!"
2,Broken after 3 weeks,"I purchased this for my son and gave it to him for Christmas. He loved it and it is alot of fun. However, it is now mid-January and it is already broken and I don't have my original receipt to return it. The lock doesn't work so all you have to do is pull it open. I'm very disappointed."
5,The Best and Most Consistent Cookbook I Use,"I have been incredibly pleased with _One Dish Meals_. The recipes are quick, easy and extremely tasty. Even meals which feature combinations which sound unusual have resulted in rave reviews. The wine suggestions are also fun for those newly interested in wine.I am buying copies of this book for my friends and family. This is the first cookbook which has seemed wonderful enough to do so!"
4,Dreamy and Emotional,"I'm an American living in Switzerland and stumbled on Raphael in Seville, Spain! I had never heard of him and bought the album on a hunch. I'd give it 3 stars except for for cut #3, ""Prayer"", which has an unusually strong effect on me, evoking feelings of sadness and yearning, especially when the CD artwork is viewed as I listen. Most comparable music, feeling wise, for me is certain cuts on ""Deep Breakfast"" by Ray Lynch. I'm curious about Music to Disappear In."
3,Angels are too deep,"I'm a massage therapist, and Raphael's music to disappear in and music to disappear in II have been among my massage music favorites. Angel's of the deep, however, was a little new-agey for me. It lacks much of the musicality of the previous two. If you like your music deep-space, you might enjoy this one. Myself, I prefer the rhythms and moods of Raphael's earlier work."
3,"cheap, cute, small, nice, NOISYYYYYYYY. :(",The title tells everything.Unfortunately the internal power supply comes with a very noise small fan that starts slow and silent but in 10 to 15 minutes it accelerate and makes a noise that is absolutely unbearable. It's comparable to a small vacuum cleaner.One detail is that I Iive in Hawaii. MAYBE in a cold place this guy would stay silent.Everything else about this product is perfect.
5,dvd plus cd set,This is an attractively packaged (with liner notes) dvd plus cd set. Brother Ray is in fine form.
4,Muir's Text of Pathology,I am looking for This book for my friend Writer: Muir's (RNM)Mascween and Kwhaley Muir's (Medical Pathology)14th Edition Name of the Book (Muir's Text book of Pathology) I Need Only The 14th Edition.
5,Best Ever,OTH is the best show ever!!!!! I can't wait until it comes out on DVD. It should have came sooner like The OC...
2,The O.C is way better!,"buy the OC instead. its waaaaaaay better than one tree hill. it only has few good actors, where all the cast in the OC are awesomee with great episodes, drama with alot of comedy unlike one tree hill which has absolutely no comedy!"
3,the oc is better...,"if you want to watch a really good, way better than one tree hill teenage soap, watch the OC. sure, the seasons may cost more- [...]a season, but considering how much better the show is, its worth the extra money. this show is not one that grabs your attention and roots you to your couch as well as the OC. the pilot for the OC was a lot better than this show the goods for the oc is that it picked up on the story quick and had you begging for the next season to come out sooner. and it has fresh hot characters, drama, plot twists, and laughs. this show is okay, but the OC is much more exciting."
1,How can this have 5 stars?,"I do not understand why enough people like this show to actually let it have a 5 star rating. One Tree Hill is easily one of the most conscience-deprived pieces of fluff to ever reach television, much less the WB network. The WB has been known for groundbreaking series since its creation, yet this ""show"" is neither innovative nor interesting. It's the same crap TV execs have been churning out since ""Dynasty"" pioneered crappy weekly soaps.For the record, I've seen about 8 or 9 of these episodes, just because I was giving it a little time to impress me.It never happened.Do yourslelf a favor and get the Everwood DVDs instead."
5,Great idea by the WB,"I had seen a couple of episodes of One Tree Hill, but never really got into it. Then while on one trip, my sister had this so I decided to watch it to pass the time on the road, and boy did I get hooked. This is by far my favorite show on t.v. It is very entertaining and I just had to watch episode after episode. I found myself finishing one episode and going right to the next. I could not get enough of this show. I definately recommend this for any OTH fans or anyone that wants to get into this show. This is a GREAT buy!"
3,Why fullscreen?,"It is beyond me why such a good show be published today fullscreen with a very poor video quality...sometimes you seem to be watching a video tape and not a DVD. So I really hope Season 2 will correct all these issues. I rate the series 4 1/2 stars for plot, but 1 star for DVD quality."
5,Great tv show,"Buy this season on dvd, it's totally recommended but highly addicted :DLucas, Nathan, Peyton, Hailey, Brooke, Jake, Mouth, Dan ( it's one of the villians of the show, but with soul ), Karen, Deb, Keith and Coach Durham, make ONE TREE HILL as a good, entertaining and a must see tv show."
4,"A little slow, but it pays off later.","This show starts out slow, but now that I have completed the 3rd season, I can tell you that it pays off later. I highly recommend this show to anyone that likes teen shows. But what I really like is the fact that the parents have a major role in this show too. It's good soap opera stuff...love triangles...secrets they learn about their parents..etc. One Tree Hill gets better and better after each season."
4,great gift,Bought this as a christmas present for my roommate who has become obsessed with this show. She loved it. I have now had to purchase seasons 3-5 just to get her through break.
5,great season,"Overall, this was an amazing season (partly due to the great actors and actresses). It was filled with action, suspense, and a really surprising ending that even I didn't see coming.Five stars all the way :)"
4,Good Job,"The transaction was smooth. The product came quickly and very safely packaged. I love One Tree Hill, and am glad I chose to purchase Season 1 here. Thanks."
5,one tree hill nock off?,when i first saw a promo for one tree hill I thought great a Dawson's Creek nock off. Not one year since the show was done. But the way that nathan and lucas brothers who hate each showed that in a way they were different but maybe were a lot a like. Both wanted the same girl Peyton Sawyer. Who also wasnt exactly who she protrayed either. With her best friend Brooke who was very sexual and just being herself. With lucas best freind Haley James who nathan uses to get to lucas at first but then really starts to love. With all this basketball being in this and cheerleaders this show proved to be a no holds barred show. And turned into my favorite show.
1,One Tree Hill- The worst thing on the surface of the Earth,"Ok this show has got to be the absolute worst show I have ever seen! The actors... if you could even call them that... are god-awful, and the plot hits rock bottom. Even the clothes are terrible. OH and the worst part... the music?? Mainstream, pop-culture crap. I could not watch more than 15 minutes of this show. Trust me, do not waste your money on this show."
1,Hometown Girl,"This show SUCKS! It's STUPID and lacks in the substance department! Do to its lack of a PLOT, they have, like, 25 climaxes in one episode to make up for the stupidity. If you have a brain, you won't buy it. That's all. Thank you."
4,Pretty Awesome...a little short though,"9 songs, and one filler noise track...so 8 songs. Ugh! Why do bands do that?My first time listening to this, I really didn't care too much about it. There were some great riffs, but it was so ""progressive"" that it didn't flow...so I got bored. But the more I listen to this, the more I like it. It's got a good sound....crunch Bloodbath guitars with some melodic thrash thrown in.All in all, if you're looking for a new melodic death band to check out, give this a whirl. It's unique enough to explore, yet still thrashy and heavy enough to mosh too. Good stuff."
5,wow.,"really incredible album. awsome production quality. some of centinex early work had somewhat mediocre production value which made it kind of hard to listen to, eventhough the music was heavy as hell and still great. but DECADENCE is flawless in that category. This music itself is a great new style of metal that Centinex has perfected. Its extremely heavy, awsome lyrical content, great drumming, and some KILLER guitar riffs. any metalhead can really enjoy this effort. it's definately worth checking it out. i promise u wont be dissapointed!"
4,An overlooked feel good story,"Linda Hamilton plays the main character and goes through a number of trials and betrayals. Never fear, in classic Christmas fashion, the ending makes you feel great and happy. It is a heartwarming holiday film that likely reflects too many real lives. It is worth the watch."
4,home for xmas,"haven't received this DVD as of yet. But, every year it was enjoyable to view. Glad I will have it to watch ""whenever!"""
5,A Powerful Christmas Movie worth buying,"When I first watched this movie the beginning seemed a bit depressing because of everything that happens to the main character.It is very believable and made me think about those who have been in a similar situation and found themselves homeless. The ending is wonderful and it inspired me to share with more than one ""adopt a family"" this past Christmas. I've been blessed with a home, a job that I love, health, family and friends. This movie made me truly appreciate all that God has given me, and inspired me to share more with others who are less fortunate."
3,Home by Christmas,I was sastisfied with this purchase it came on time and was packaged as it should be no schathes on disk and it played well so I couldnt be happier.Thank YouBarb
2,Totally unbelievable even for a Christmas movie,"What was believable in this movie was how fast the divorce took this woman down. She didn't seem to come with any common sense -- which would have her hire a great lawyer in the first place, not to mention keep money in a secret account. But what wasn't believable even for a Christmas movie, was that people kept saying how pretty she was when in fact she looked terrible. What was that hairdo supposed to do? Also, were we to believe she didn't know how to wash and style her own hair?? Also what wasn't believable was that she had no resources of friends, and didn't use the one (the old man) she had. It was a shame that she had to play Cinderella instead of a person who finds their own strength. I much preferred her homeless friend, but don't believe that she wouldn't have just taken menial work and be done with it. Oh well, back to Scrouge and the ghosts, all believable."
5,Excellent!,"""Home by Christmas"" is a depiction of real life ~ in a nutshell; but what a story of hope! Linda Hamilton does an excellent job portraying the devastation that is the reality of an unexpected divorce. However, she also conveys well that good consequences follow good decisions if paired with determination and a refusal to give up. I also admire Ms. Hamilton as an actress...she has not chosen to have ""experience"" removed from her face as so many actors have, and she is beautiful."
4,Mrs. Jackson does it again!,This book is an example of how Mrs. Jackson continues to deliver a page turner for her readers. It also allows you to catch up with members of the Madaris family.
5,SECRET LOVE WONDERFUL STORY,"THE STORY WAS WONDERFUL. FULL OF LIFE, LOVE AND ROMANCE. IT WILL MAKE YOU CRY AND LAUGH AT THE SAME TIME. IT'S EVERY WOMAN'S DREAM TO FIND THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE AND IN BRENDA'S BOOKS YOU FIND HIM. GIRL YOU OUT DID YOURSELF AGAIN KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. I'LL BE WAITING FOR THE NEXT BOOK."
2,Not for you,This dvd is not for you unless u consider an interview worth it because thats basically all it is.i watched the first dvd and for 90 minutes expected the best to come but it never did.its a 90 min dvd of just clips of basically nothing. toilet issues and drinking problems (not slipknot)i regretted buying it and felt let down.not what i expectedthe 2nd dvd has its moments.the interview and the live shows which we already have more from disasterpieces.thats it.
2,THE FIRST DISC IS BAD / THE SECOND IS WORTH A LOOK,"I GOT THIS DVD WITH HOPE OF WATCHING AN INFORMATIVE DOCUMENTRY OF SLIPKNOT IN WHICH I WOULD SEE FOOTAGE FROM THE LAST 233 CRAZY SHOWS THEY HAD PERFORMED AROUND THE WORLD. INSTEAD, THE FIRST DISC, CONTAINING THE DOCUMENTRY, FOCUSED ON TOILETS AND A CREW MEMBER VOMITING. THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME I WAS HITTING THE FAST FOWARD BUTTON, HOPING THAT THE MOVIE WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE SOME FOCUS. IT SIMPLY DIDN'T. IT SEEMS THAT THE FIRST DISC WAS ATTEMPTING TO BE ARTISTIC WITH CAMERA SHOTS THAT, FOR THE MOST PART, HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BAND. APPARENTLY, PISSING IN A TOILET IS ARTISTIC TO THE BAND. THE SECOND DISC WAS VERY COOL WITH INTERVEIWS, LIVE CONCERT FOOTAGE, AND VIDEOS. I LOVED THE SECOND DISC, BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE FIRST DISC WHICH HAD HORRIBLE SOUND QUALITY, CONFUSING MENUS, AND NO DIRECTION."
1,I bought it and sold it within the first week!,This is a poorly directed video.It is not something you can watch more than once.The concert footage looks like it came from a cell phone.It's hard to navigate through the menus to find what you want.I've heard Disasterpieces is much better in quality.I haven't seen it yet.Don't waste your time or money!I was expecting more.
1,This is Awful!,"This thing really stinks. It opens with a man urinating into a toilet. Later, a guy gets drunk and starts puking. Who needs to see that? The live footage was shot by Shawn Crahan onstage. It should have been done professionaly like on Disasterpieces, a much better DVD. No insight is provided here about the band, what their lives are like on the road, etc. Stay away from this."
2,"It's no Disasterpiece, it's just a disaster.","It was really hard to watch it. It's just so damn boring! There were some cool parts, watching Joey play drums is always amazing, but it was basicly just a bunch of little clips that arnt really very interesting. And the sound quality was terrible! The mics in video cameras really arnt that great for picking up very loud concert footage. The second disc was pretty good. It was interesting to see the band without their masks. Also, the music videos were awesome, and the live performances were pretty good. But the documentary was just horrible and didnt really document anything interesting. Buy the Disasterpieces dvd."
4,VOLIMINAL: INSIDE THE NINE,DVD was good. Thought there would be more concert then there was. Would like to see more of a concert DVD less interviews
4,Before I Forget to Write a Review...,"I was really excited of this new Slipknot DVD. I have to say that the first disc which includes the movie was quite awful. There was just drinking, vomiting and all kinds of stuff like that. It's OK to watch one or two times but it's not high quality. The second disc was much better. There was five music videos which all were excellent. There were all the music videos from ""Vol 3"" and the music video made from the live album. There is also 9 live tracks and 9 interviews. They were interviewed without the masks, mostly! I have to say I'm quite satisfied. A slipknot fan should have this DVD!Music videos:1. Duality2. Vermilion3. Vermilion pt.24. Before I Forget5. The Nameless (live)Live:1. (sic)2. The Blister Exists3. Eyeless4. Duality5. Vermilion6. The Heretic Anthem7. Pulse of the Maggots8. Before I Forget9. People=Sh*t"
3,not good.,"I would rate this one star, if it weren't for the interviews. I love slipknot, so I was stoked to watch the interviews. But the actual movie was horrible. It was choppy w/ no direction...and peeing in a toilet?? They think they're being artistic but they are actually just being jerks by wasting my money. Hopefully, in the future, they will put out better DVDs. This one gave me a headache."
2,Not a good buy,"First of all, it doesn't show a full live song just bits and pieces of them. Second it looks like it was filmed by a LSD tripping drunk guy! There are so many special effects in the movie it makes you want to puke. If you were tripping it would probably make a good movie LOL. I thought it was rather boring. The only good thing was the music videos. As for the live concert footage there wasn't much to show just little pieces edited together. I would not recommend this video. The effects in the video make me dizzy and take away from the concerts."
2,"Slipknot rules, This dvd doesn't!","There other dvds blow this one away! The menu is wierd to figure out at first, The interviews tell us nothing. The live footage is bizarre. The space in between is exactly that. It gives me a headache to watch! I know that was probably what clown was going for but it doesn't make it any easier on the eyes! I own all there other dvds and would recommend one of them above this one"
3,Weber Grill,"On June 8, I bought this for my husband for fathers day. It came 2 days after fathers day, and was damaged. When I contacted Amazon, we were told that because it was a gas item they could not take it back. They suggested we contact Weber, and have them fix it. Which we did. Then July 4 came and went and we still didn't have a grill. Weber had ordered the parts, but the parts had not come in. After several phone calls back and forth to Amazon, they agreed to send a new grill. Yesterday, the new grill finally arrived, and we put it together last night. It seems to be an overall good grill, easy assemply, but we have not yet had an opportunity to use it."
1,Shipped Poorly,This product was shipped to poor construction. It was hard to put together. I had to bend several parts to put this together
4,Cookin' with gas,"This grill was purchased as a Mothers Day gift. It arrived on time and in fine condition. Assembly was accomplished easily with two sets of hands. Although made out of our country, I consider it a fine product. After all, it IS a Weber. Mom has not fired it up yet as she is in her 87th year and waiting for some grands or great-grands to stop in for some grillin'."
4,A useful tool for critical care nurses,"This book is very useful as a practical reference in clinical setting and for developing internal procedures.It is well organised and peer reviewed.Each procedure is clearly described step by step and furthermore the rational for each action specified. The expected outcomes are mentionned, further references are available at the end of each chapter.I believe that this manual can be useful to nursing students,experienced nurses, advance practice nurses and even physicians working in a ICU."
5,For Creative Children,"This book is for all those children who have imagination, who have imaginary friends that they communicate with, this book gives children the opportunity to be part of the story, and let's them create with Darinka.How wonderful! Children will have a real deer with this book."
5,"Bravo, Rachel Luna!","During our study of New York City habitatsI read ""Darinka"" to my second grade students. I was thrilled by their responses to this story! At the conclusion, I asked what the author's message may have been. Answers included that you should ""stick to your dreams"" and that you should ""follow your heart"" even if it means ""sticking out of the crowd."" I'm so happy that second graders could verbalize these important life lessons after such a fine book! Bravo, Rachel Luna!"
3,Starts out well but fizzles about 2/3rds of the way through,"The plot:A young woman visiting an old flame on a Caribbean island books passage on a ship heading to New York. Her friend, recently injured in a riding accident, entrusts her to deliver a package for him since he cannot make the trip himself. On board she discovers the contents, and a chain of events, including the deaths of two others on board, begins. Among the ""suspects"" is a poisonous snake being transported back to the states in the cabin of a passenger.My review:The adventures on board the ship hold your attention, and the confined space makes for a whodunit in the grand tradition, since there are only a handful of suspects. Once the action changes to New York, interest flags a bit. I grew quite weary of the heroine's actions, although the denouement shows the logic behind what she does.All in all, an okay mystery in the Golden Age vein."
2,Harware is okay,"I purchased this as I thought it would be better since it was not one of the cheap ones. The stand itself seems quite nice, but they include the cheapest screws and allen wrench you can imagine. The allen wrench did not even last through putting all of the legs on. The screws are so cheap I am leaving now to get some good ones to finish putting it together. An by the time you have it most of the way together are you really going to take it apart and spend shipping to return it? I would recommend not purchasing this product."
3,Description lacks a diameter or bird size.,So what size bird can use this? Medium doesn't tell me much. Please be more specific. Thanks.
4,Spores & Aliens,"""This Side of Paradise"" A planet laced with plants that shoot out spores which make everyone happy & content infects the crew of the Enterprise. How will they break free?""Devil in the Dark"" An underground monster is killing a bunch of miners. Why? Watch & find out."
5,"Great Book, But Needs an Update","What a fun book for the true Redbird fan. A 142-page history of the club, followed by a section with photos of every single player, coach, and manager to ever wear the Birds-on-the-Bat, profiles of every Redbird Hall of Famer, pages of statistics, and color reproductions of antique scorecards and memorabilia. It's a great book to leaf through while listening to KMOX or to end arguments over trivia. A Cardinals fan's delight. The only downside is that it's getting dated. It came out in 1998, so it doesn't include McGwire's 70, or Edmonds and Pujols. It needs another edition, and it's good enough and comprehensive enough that the publishers should seriously think about coming out with a fresher edition."
4,Fun but short,Bought as a gift for my husband (a Harry Potter fan). He liked it but it is a little short.
4,Adorable but a bit short,"My 13 year old HP obsessed daughter wears this scarf to school every day. We live in a very cold climate, so it is actually a nice scarf, warm and soft. It's on the short side, so it's hard to wrap, but all in all, we are very happy with this purchase!"
3,Perfect present,"My daughter wanted a Hogwarts scarf for Christmas. I checked @ stores and knew I'd have to search online for one. She was very pleased with the scarf. Perfect length, the material isn't too thick--wears nice."
2,PHYTOSOLAIRE,"This product didn't do a thing for me. My skin is very fair and I had high hopes for this treatment. I followed instructions carefully, but no results...I still got burned and no tan."
2,"Had Potential, but made a U-Turn.","I had a lot of high hopes for this book. Sirona Knight has obvious experience with magic, and talent with the pen. Dream Magic starts out weakly, yet another book that feels the need to defend itself in the first few chapters. (The usual, and far too often repeated magic isn't Satanism, Some Christians aren't that understanding...blah blah blah.) Then I started to really enjoy myself while working through her versions of quarter calling, circle castings, and astral meditations. However, I expected her to go into more advanced studies...or further details and she never did. The start of what could be an awesome book drops off into a number of love and wealth spells. What a let down."
4,A Nice Cookbook for the Beginner to Intermediate Practitioner,"Sirona Knight's book on Dream Magic provides a solid foundation for the practice of magic in and around sleep. The reader should have a good working knowledge of magic theory before picking up the book, as the work provides little of that. Without the prep and background that would be provided in other books, this is just another wierd list of spells, smells and bells. With a background and proper preparation, however, the book proves to be a pretty powerful tome - full of useful ritual and spell ideas. Each ritual is well documented, and the needs list both in summary form at the beginning of the book, as well as at each ritual makes it very practical to use. Like a cookbook, if you know how to cook already, you can make some great stuff with the recipies. If you don't, the book won't teach you how. Same here..."
2,Don't be fooled. This is NOT a book about dream work.,"This is a Wicca 101 book in disguise. I have an interest in dream recall, alternate conscious states and lucid dreaming. This is not what I expected. This author teaches how to set up an altar, cast a circle and spellcast under the guise of 'dream magic'. Nice marketing ploy."
1,Nancy and Lee 3,"I'm sorry, I'm a huge fan of Nancy Sinatra but this CD is the worst. The packaging looks like it was done on a home computer, the disc actually has a paper label! With the exception of Nancy's solo version of ""The Hungry Years"" the songs are tired, cliched and just annoying. Nancy's voice has aged into a very sultry-smokey sound but Lee needs to give it up! I fear a better cultural experience could be had watching re-runs of ""Cops"" on Fox!"
1,RIP,"Overpriced and unsatisfying comeback attempt that falls flat. GYPSIES AND INDIANS, AFTER THE LOVIN and GOIN DOWN ROCKIN were interminable. Why did they make this cd? Have no idea. Unforgetable it's not."
5,Why'd they wait so long????!!,"A great mix of works, a little rock'n'roll, some ballads, love songs, some country, all done like nobody else can do. Lee's voice is an octave lower (if that's possible)(lose the ciggies, Barton!), and Nancy's is mellow, intense, sultry, whatever the song calls for, and her natural vibrato is wonderfully warm. Her solo rendition of ""The Hungry Years"" is the best on the album and one of her best of all time. ""Packsaddle"" has great lyrics and melody, is a lot of fun, and should be a hit on any country chart (as well as ""Texas Blue Moon""). ""Is Makin' a Little Love Out of the Question"" is a riot. ""After the Loving"" is a very sweet love song, and ""Loving You Loving Me"" is another hit. Why'd they wait so long??!!"
1,Sub-standard,"There's better books on the subject out there then this one. I was disappointed when this book arrived, primarily because the notation is so poorly presented in the book that it is completely distracting. That is my first and biggest complaint about this book. The notation and presentation of beats is written for complete beginners and is very distracting and annoying for someone who can actually read drum notation (how hard is it anyway to read drum notation?). For instance, there are two beats on each page where there could be twenty.Secondly, the meat of the book isnt quite there. Once you go through this book, sure, it will make you a little stronger, but you will be thinking, thats it?My opinion is, skip this book and pick up a copy of Colin Bailey's bass drum book. Or if you must pick this up, dont expect it to be extremely through on the subject, rather a starting point."
5,Tipbook,Gives a lot of knowledge to all areas of the instrument including different opinion's on various topics. if you want to get to know about saxophones start here!
5,A well of information for beginners,I fond the Saxophone Tipbook to contain a lot of valuable information for me as a novice saxophone player...
5,Great Book,I received it in the time promised and a must read for marksmen. Great product and seller.
5,a gift from a god of music,"this cd is simply wonderful, the recordings were recently uncovered and assembled by hartford's band member and banjoist extraordinaire bob carlin, he has given us something really special. as important to own as the two albums that it overlaps with: steam powered aereoplane and morning bugle. now if someone could just release the never-released album radio john, we'd really be swimming in classic amazing john hartford music. this is some of that"
4,"Massacre in the foodcourt, pics at eleven...","I understand this is the second in a series, so I gotta check out the first one, Numbers, which I assume is also great based on what I have seen here.... this is good crimedrama action, with witty, real-sounding dialogue and some nice noir touches in the artwork. I can honestly say I have never seen anything quite like it. Original, quality read."
5,necessary,"A necessary introduction to Camel for those who care to follow the journey. Bonus tracks amaze those who bought earlier live versions - not available elsewhere. If you were lucky enough to hear Camel live, especially recently, you will treasure this - hold on to it, but share with friends of the vision. Never give a day away..."
5,This is the H:TLJ Season To Get!!!,"Season Four of HERCULES THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS is going to be great! Not only is it a season we've never seen before on either DVD or videotape but it also features such great episodes like ""Web of Desire"" (Introducing Nebula), ""Heroes Heart"" (Are Hercules and Iolaus really parting?), ""Stranger in a Strange World"" (Introduction the black clad ""Sov"" as well as alternate Iolaus), ""And Fancy Free"" (Introduction the Widow Twanky) and the classic ""Armageddon Now"" with guest stars Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor as Xena and Gabrielle. And if that doesn't grab you, how about Kevin Smith playing both Ares and Iphicles (""War Wounds"") this season? There is so much to look forward to! I can hardly wait!"
3,Cheap Packaging!,"Personally, Season 4 of Hercules was my favorite. However, after buying all six seasons, Season 4 seems to not work in my DVD player. The rest of the seasons however, work perfectly. I blame the packaging with its overlapping discs. It creates scratches near the centers of the discs and causes my DVD player to make an incessent hammering noise."
3,Hercules The Legendary Journeys-Season 4,I'm not a fan of the show. But it was the ONLY way for me to get my hands on the Xena: Warrior Princes cross-over episodes. Those I keep and watch. The rest of the season 4 went to donation. The price was right for the episodes to complete my collection!
2,non working disk.,i like this BUT there is one disk that does not work and there is another one that the episodes are mixed up.
5,Great for a gift .......or a prize....... or.......,"This is a wonderful packet. There are 8 different note cards on one side and a book with quotes about tea on the other. I have gotten several of these to give as gifts and to use as door prizes at events. I also have had several for myself. Why would I need more than one? I have used the cards as invitations to teas, then have given the books as a gift to one of the guests. I keep one on hand at all times, never knowing when I may decide to hostess another tea. Actually, the cards are lovely enough to frame and I keep thinking ....... one day! *sigh* If you are looking for recipes, this isn't it. If you just love the idea of beautiful paintings and gracious words, this is it! Or remember the tea lover on your gift lists."
4,Long ranges - long talk time - loud environment - NO PROBLEM,"I used the previous model CT10 and was very satisfied with it. After about three years (and that even surprised customer service) I had to exchange the battery for the first time. My job requires to phone extensively long in order to repair equipment in different factories in US - Mexico - Canada - Germany. Long range (away from base) - long talk time - loud environment - NO PROBLEM.So far I used the CT12 a couple of times and had the same results. Plantronics designs with the customer in mind and has a couple of improvements on CT12 that make live easier. There is always space for improvement, but well...Plantronics CT12 is very close to perfect."
3,Interfers with wireless systems,I do love this phone. The sound is clear and its very easy to use. HOWEVER..... I have a wireless system and I am constantly being knocked off the internet when I am using this phone. I bought it for my home based business that requires computer and phone use..I am not able to use it because it disconnects me from my customers. However I did gift it to my daughter who doesn't have a wireless system and she absolutely loves it.
3,Plantronics Cordless Headset Phone,"The sound quality is hissy, and wavy. When we pull the headset off the receiver and plug it into a different phone, the sound quality is better. So the headphones/microphone assembly is top notch. The tiny little receiver unit isn't as good as others. However, for a person with limited use of the hands, the small receiver unit is easier to hold and dial.Fred"
4,Great headset,"Great headset - has superb call quality. Also, we have SEVERAL 802.11 wireless networks running in our office, and I don't get any interference with any of them. The only two complaints I have are:1 - Mute button doesn't mute the call - this may be a compatibility issue with my phone, however...2 - The ""firefly"" indicator light that flashes to let others know you are on a call makes a slight (barely audible) noise while on a call. I may see if I can disable this, since everyone in my office always asks me if I'm on a call anyway...Otherwise it is the perfect headset - highly recommended."
3,"Great concept, but too much static","I love the idea of this phone, and I've heard great things about it from people I work with. Unfortunately, the one I received had a constant static problem. I used it in different locations - near and far from electronic devices, and the problem was the same. Ultimately, my cordless phone with a hands free plug-in was superior, so I sent it back. I was very sad to send it away, but static is not something I can tolerate."
3,It's okay...,"Well, I have had better phones... and better headsets. My biggest complaint is that the sound quality is terrible. The buttons are also quite small. The base is very light weight.. so much so that it can be easily pushed around on a desk.. or knocked off even. I should have known better because I have been fooled by Plantronic junk before... The reason I gave it a try is because it's so hard to find a small cordless phone like this. I am now back to using a regular sized cordless phone."
4,Great Cordless Economical Phone,"I initially purchased phone to keep my husband off his cellular phone while at home during the day to help save his peak minutes. We love the phone because it allows us the freedom of movement that other yet cordless phones do not have, primarily the sleekness and weight of the phone itself and the two types of headsets that comes with the phone for your convenience. I am very pleased with the product and would recommend to anyone who is looking for a handfree cordless phone. Great phone to purchase for elderly parents or anyone who has trouble handling a handset. The ID caller area is a little smaller than I would like but I can live with it. Thank you."
3,"Great phone, but kills my wireless connection 50% of the time","I've had this phone for a couple of years now. I bought it to use for phone conferencing while I work from home. I like that it is fully cordless so you can use the handsfree and have a dialpad that is completely mobile. The Mute button and Caller ID are great features. But there is one problem that has me now looking for a replacement. This phone operates at 2.4 GHz and about half the time it knocks out my wireless internet connection when I use it. This makes it really hard to use when working from home! I know that other reviewers have said that it doesn't affect their other devices, but it does with mine - so I wouldn't recommend the gamble."
4,margo's review,"This head set is ok, I just don't like how the clip does'nt stay on. Other than that it's a great phone."
3,Decent headset phone,"I bought this phone to replace a 7 year old GE headset phone which served me well. Working for a call center I knew of the good reputation of the Plantronics name.Overall, it's a nice little phone, with emphasis on the ""little!"" The handset buttons are tinier than many cell phone keypads, so big fingers may struggle a bit. The sound is adequate, although not as clear as my GE. It's a bit fuzzy sounding, but overall that's not a big deal. It has a quiet oscillation noise that seems to correspond with the blinking red light on the headset mouthpiece - this bothered me at first but now I can ignore it. My biggest complaint about the phone is you can't tell when you're muted - it doesn't say ""Mute"". That's kind of a pain, especially when on conference calls with intermittenly noisy pets in the background.All in all, I would recommend this phone to someone who wants an inexpensive, decent but not amazing sounding phone, and who can stand a couple quirks."
4,Good Phone...no interference!,New job requires HOURS on the phone. Got this on the advice of a colleague. Works like a champ....NO INTERFERENCE with Linksys Wireless G Broadband Router. Just be sure to keep it charged....I may yet spring for an extra battery. Only thing I would change would be the method of securing the headset cord. It is susceptible to catching on things as it hangs.....I'd buy this again!
5,"Lightweight, Clear, FeatureRich, Long Life TalkTime!","For hands free walkabout capabilities this product shines. There does not appear to be any competing products with the wired headset connected to a dialer element first of all. My older ""like"" phone died and I wanted at least the same capabilities. This phone had it all: a light headset that adjusts very easily, clarity in sound for speaking and listening, LONG talk time on the battery that is stock with the phone, caller ID for incoming calls (while on line). Price is not cheap, but I do get the value from it I need to justify the price I paid."
4,Functionally a great phone,"After using this unit for several months, I am pretty happy with it. Call quality is second to none and I have owned several others in the past. I only have 2 real issues with the unit.1) there is no battery meter, and when this battery runs low, you have very little time to work with. When it goes, it goes fast.2) The ear hook and inverted cup that fits against your ear is not a very good fit at all. It stays in place, but it just isn't comfortable at all. If you are wearing this for hours at a time, the complete headset (comes with it) is a much better option, just bulkier."
5,Best Headset We've used,"This is a heavy duty little unit. To dial you will need your reading glasses. We had used the Radio Shack model prior to this and they never lasted more than a month without the headset wire breaking. This one has been in use since Janurary 1st and is not even sweating yet.Time will tell, but it seems to be a great phone."
4,Nice piece of equipment,"This phone was recommended to me by a friend. It is a nice piece of equipment for the price. Good range, works well, comfortable headset, and the phone unit and buttons are top quality. I would recommend it highly."
4,Good value,"The headset could fit a bit better, and the cord can be a pain sometimes when you're walking around. I've snagged it a few times, but have gone to tucking it inside my shirt which helps. The menu options on the keys are pretty small, and if you're vision isn't the best they can be very hard to read. But once, I got used to where everything is that's not a big deal anymore.Sound quality is very good. All in all, a good solid product for the price."
2,There Has Got To Be Something Better,"I hated giving up my GE headset which was great, but old. Buying a new one, all I could find was this Plantronics.I was very disappointed in that whomever I am talking with cannot hear me through the headset speaker. Very annoying that I have to move the earpiece halfway off my ear to arrange the mouthpiece to fit closer to my mouth."
2,This is NOT cordless,I have been using Plantronics headsets for a long time and I like Plantronics products very much. When I bought this I wanted one that's cordless--has NO cord from the headset to the handset. This is NOT cordless. I already have the same set up with the Plantronics headset I plug into my existing handset.
3,Not good enoug to be the only phone,"Bought this in hope of being able to jettison a GNN Netcom 920 that people complain about when I'm using. Plantronics is a nice bundle but the audio is blurby on my end and the clip does not secure the unit to a pocket, so I end up carrying it instead of attaching.Cool to have the dial pad with you wherever you go. Wish Google would enter the cordless phone market and shake up Plantronics/GNN thinking so they'd innovate. The market is flat on its back without ideas right now."

3,Plantronics CT12 2.4 GHz DSS Cordless Headset Phone with Caller ID,"size is great, clips onto pocket, waistband or easy to carry around. Am not using the caller ID feature. Volume control from my end is good. People I call say that I sound far away - since I am using a headset, I have to put the mike piece almost in my mouth for it to sound better for my listener. That is the piece I am disappointed in. I have had the CT-10 before and this is much better."
5,No more sore neck,"I love this phone. I had an older plantronics headset for years but it finally wore out. I work from home quite a bit and am using the phone for meetings frequently. The headset is a must. Works great...mute is simple to deal with and has a decent range.My only complaint about this product compared to the previous one I had is that you can't have it on the charger while in use...it hangs up. This limits the time you can use the phone without charging though to this point I've not hit that limit even after 2 hour calls.Oh, the other problem I have noticed is that when receiving a call my Linksys wireless router will disconnect. Not an issue when placing calls though."
3,Good phone - except in wireless environment,"Good phone, however, it conflicts with other wireless devices, such as a wireless modem. You can switch channels on the phone fairly quickly and easily as a short term fix. Usually this appears to shift the frequency enough to bypass the interference and allow sufficient signals to the laptop/PC. I wish I had known this inconvenience existed prior to purchase. I would encourage Plantronics to make note on the website to inform buyers of this problem."
4,Plantronics headset,"I love this product. It does exactly what I need it to do - I work from home and I'm on the phone constantly for meetings. I'm able to walk around, do laundry, cook food - anything. I don't have to be stuck near the phone all day.Compared to the much more expensive Plantronics options I think this is definitely worth the money -There is occasional interference when I go near my wireless router, but apparently it can only be heard on my end."
2,Mobile but Not Quality,"I was happy to find a phone with a mute button after my GE crapped out. This was a great phone for 2 to 3 weeks until the cord that attached the headphones starting to make a crackling noise. Also, the WiFi network card I used interferred with the phone everytime, rendering it useless while using my laptop.I so badly wanted this phone to work and work well. All other aspects were superb: large reception area, too many Caller Id stored numbers to count, great features and compact, PLUS a mute button for when one must do laundry on long conference calls from home.This phone is wonderful in theory, not so hot on actual function."
2,"Very Poor Item, disconnects wireless network",I bought this phone after using a 900mhz plantronics product and am very disappointed. It is basically useless since I only use this working from home and need to be on my computer simultaneously. Using this headset disconnects my wireless network. Not the quality you expect from Plantronics.
2,"great phone, but wireless network killer","Love the phone. Had it for a year before I put in a wireless network, then lost the network everytime I used the phone. It's a paperweight now unfortunately. As someone said below, you can change the channel, but only after you are on a call. That doesn't work well since the phone is having no reception problems but it is wiping out the wireless network and doesn't care. If you get lucky and find a channel that doesn't interfere, your wireless devices will be out for a while because they are trying to reconnect to your wireless router."
3,Great phone - serious WiFi problems,"This is a great phone: clear sound, great range, convenient form factor and very comfortable. It works very well with Lucent and Avaya office phone systems, greatly extending the usefulness of those systems.However, it is horrible in an environment where any 802.11 wireless network (WiFi) is being used. It appears that it has 4 channels, and 3 of them interfere with the WiFi network to the point that it drops all connections off the access point for all users in the vicinity. This makes it pretty much unusable in a networked office environment. No amount of fiddling with the WiFi channels solves this problem. I note that Panasonic phones have this same issue, but VTech 2.4GHz phones do not.Too bad, but the one big disadvantage outweighs all the others for me."
4,Great product,"Works great. Reception is very clear. Only caveats are that there's no battery indicator other than an audible warning when you're about to run out of power, and that this will interfere with wireless networks using the 802.11g protocol."
4,Meets the need,"Thought this worked well, has a little static every now and then and once in a great while the channel will be the same as my wireless and cause a problem. All you need to do is change the channel on the phone and your wireless will start working again. I like the phone the freedom it provides is great."
2,Poor Design and System Limitations,"1. This system does not come with either a dual phone jack or a pass through connector to put it in-line with an existing phone. It has to be a standalone line2. Does not work with some PBX based office phone systems so if you were thinking about going wireless in your office, check with your IT/Phone group first."
4,READ THIS REVIEW,I am a young business man that make his money by talking on a phone. This phone is stellar. Its limitations are mostly having to do with the phone systems of some offices. Firefly light is the best invention yet. It is very light and small. It can definately be used in conjunction with a multi-line phone as long as you are not constantly transfering calls like a switchboard operator. Don't be afraid to buy this phone if you get it for under a bill.
1,Plantronics CT12 2.4 GHz DSS Cordless Headset Phone with Caller ID,"I Have problem with this order, I dont recive Yet, What happendThank you.Abel Berrios"
4,Plantronics CT12 2.4 good but too small,"Plantronics has been making these products for years and their operation is mostly very good. This model however becomes a real eye-test to use. The multifunction buttons are hard to use and near impossible to read(function) because the button and type is so small. Some of the type is 1mm high! I've had to 'scan' the unit and make an enlarged copy to make the button type readable.Works great, very convenient otherwise."
3,Plantronics Wireless Headset,"On the plus side, the Plantronics is comfortable, and easy to use. Earpiece volume is good. The output volume of microphone is low though, and sound quality a little tinny. The called party always complains of low volume so you need to speak up. This seems like an easy fix on Plantronics part but all I have tried seem to be plagued with this. For the price it is still a good value."
3,sugarpine,"I have had this headset for 2 years and it been ok with two exceptions, One, is the headset fitting. I am not sure what size heads the models have when they design these but it sure isn't for smaller heads. I always struggle to keep it on. Two, The number pad need to have lighter/bolder numbers. Since I am not a fan of the earpieces, as one, reviewer wrote, ""it's the only game in town"". Even with the two problems it's ok for what I need."
4,good phone,"this is a good phone, it does not get the full 4 hours of usage without being recharged, but the clarity makes up for it"
2,What used to be good...,"I have used this phone in the past and this is my third. This last phone has had complications with reception and battery power. What used to be a good thing has just slipped in quality. Sad because it's a good size and fit for my home, but when things go wrong, it's time to move on."
3,Great if you don't have wireless/internet,"I purchase this phone for home office use. It started off great, but while on the phone with clients looking up there information, my computer would lock up or become slow, or wouldn't bring up requested WINDOWS. I had to return the headset. The hearing and quaility on the phone was great, but THIS HEADSET DOES NOT WORK WITH WIRELESS OR INTERNET."
3,Skip it if you have a wireless router!,"I really, really like this phone. Great design, great range, great voice quality, great Firefly headset.*BUT* it crashes my wireless router!I should have read the other reviews (though most of them were not out here when I purchased the phone) because I started having router issues shortly after getting the phone. I replaced my router (Linksys 54G --> D-Link DIR-655), I replaced my cable modem, the cable company ran a new drop, put in a new splitter, etc, etc... I finally figured out it is the Plantronics CT-12 phone that was causgin the issues. Oh, if I could only have my countless troubleshooting hours back!!"
3,Plantronics CT12 disrupted my 802.11g network,"I can't give this a complete review because I didn't get a chance to fully use it. I read some reviews that said this product was fine with wireless networks, and others that said it only disrupted 802.11b networks. The wireless in my office is 802.11g and as soon as I took a call on this or tried to make one, it killed the entire network. When I hung up, everything came back online. It was reproducible and predictable, so it was definitely the CT12. I tried different channels on the device, but nothing helped.It's too bad because this is the only product with the feature set I wanted."
3,Not as great as I expected,"I should have read the description better as I realized after it arrived there is no way to use it without the headset.PROS* The sound quality and reception is great* Very lightweight* Excellent range* Durable, still works after being dropped many times (see below)CONS* Have to use the headset* Phone can not be used while it is in the base* The belt clip is very weak. It will pop off while I am walking around the house.* The button functionality is not as intuitive as other portable phones I have used.All in all I would not buy it again if I had to do it over. I would buy a separate phone handset and headset to use."
4,Plantronics Review,"Excellent Audio. This portable phone is a ""hands-free"" model that is perfectly suited to office and computer work, while allowing freedom to move about. It seems to have noise cancelling capability that is excellent for noisy environments. I tested the range of the device and found that it easily exceeded one mile (at my location), without dropping out, or hanging up. Persons I have communicated with, state this phone has better audio quality than my more expensive telephone set. On the downside, the display panel is hard to read, and the touch-tone buttons are too small to use quickly. Otherwise an excellent instrument that I would highly recommend to anyone."
4,Let freedom ring (during my conference calls)!,"This phone has set me free. Recently had neck surgery which causes me to have to get up and move around often. Long conference calls are not conducive to moving about when tied to a non-portable phone. This phone allows me to move about with all the commands of a regular phone (mute, caller ID, dial, hang up, pick up, etc.). Very cool! My only down side is that I like the over-the-ear rather than the over-the-head configuration for the headset and its a bit uncomfortable for my small ear. Not a show-stopper, though. I don't have a wireless router/modem, so I don't have any issues with my other home office equipment."
3,CT12- Phone Review,"The phone and headset work pretty well from a clarity standpoint. The problems that I have, is it interferes with other wireless devices that are also 2.4 GHZ. I get kicked off my wireless internet connection at times. Sometimes I cannot get back on until I hang up. This does not always happen and sometimes changing channels helps but sometimes it does not."
4,"Compact, good quality","The item is compact in size which is very convenient. Although the headset doesn't adjust quite small enough for me. Haven't used it much yet, but the sound quality appears to be good. Packed full of features (which I have a hard time remembering how to use). Has several different ringtones, which you can assign to different callers, if you wish. That is a feature I had only had on a cell phone prior to this. Drawback: It is hard to remove from charger with the headset cord attached. Must grab it just right from the top two side edges. Overall, excellent product."
3,Should have listened to others,"I am disappointed with this phone, but mainly that is my fault as I didn't listen to others. The headset is OK (I now know it was not the previous phone that was bad but the fact that I am too close to my wireless router) but it is useless as a regular phone because you can't use it without the headset; which ticks off my wife!!I guess I should have bought a wireless headset phone."
2,"Ok, if you don't have a home wireless network","Loved the portability; unfortunately everytime I'd dial out or answer an inbound call, it would disconnect my 802.11g wireless network. I tried every channel on my Netgear router, and on the phone, and all still had the same issue. I talked to Customer Support and it's a known issue!I don't know how the FTC allows competing devices to be manufactured on the same frequencies, but don't buy this phone if you have this 802.11g router."
3,Nice Product and 2 Gripes,"Excellent sound quality, range and comfort. A visual cue (blinking red light on mic boom) when you are in an active call is an innovative addition.Two gripes: Unlike the other reviewer, it does interfere with my Linksys wireless router, so beware if you want to use these two devices competing for air space. Also, the mute feature requires that you depress the button for 2 seconds in order to activate. Not sure what Plantronics was thinking here."
2,old model,"The phone works well and good reception, but is an old model and has a few drawbacks. When on a call the phone disconnects if you want to put on the charger. Also you cant make a call while phone is on the charger.There are newer phones that have wireless headsets. I found myself ketching the cord w/ something and dropping the phone. Other than those drawbacks the phone is ok for someone that does not stay on the phone all day for work, since it only has 5.5 hr talk time."
3,Wireless Router killer!,Great phone but it will disable your wireless connection while you're on the phone.
1,Don't do it,"If you have any type of network - don't waste your money. Anytime I turned the phone on, it would drop my network connection. Returning it."
3,First Job Related Headset,"The Plantronics CT12 is a pretty good headset, although I haven't been through many used entirely for work. I don't move around much in order to fully utilize the cordless functionality of the phone, but when I do move, I can take the dialer with me.The headset itself isn't much noise cancelling, as I can hear echos when I talk sometimes. If I turn the volume up, I hear an annoying buzz in the background. Therefore, the headset isn't that great. It's comforting on your head, if you use the head piece. If you use the ear-only piece, the headset starts to hurt my ear, because you can't fit the ear cushion.Since this is my first job-related headset, I would only recommend if you move around a lot and want your phone to travel. I can't rate or review how it works with a network because I don't use a wireless network at my workplace."
2,"good phone, but kills our wireless network","good phone, but it kills our wireless network.We've moved the wireless adapters for the phones 6 feet away from our wireless network router; still NG. We get static and a disconnect from our network when the phones are used. I'll try the channel option others have suggested for our verizon router/firewall."
3,handy,"So far, this phone has proven to be reliable but I do find punching in the keys to be a little tricky since the handset is so small and the information on the keys is not clear... It would have been better if the print on the keys were in white rather than black on brown."
3,Don't buy if you have wireless router-otherwise awesome,"As with other reviewers, I have had problems with the CT12 signal interfering with my linksys G wireless router. No one-Linksys or Plantronics-has a solution for the interference.If you don't have a wireless router, the CT12 is well worth it."
1,Dissapointment ... Had to return,"Like many other people, I had to return this phone because it contstantly knocked me off of the interenet. I tried changing the channel on my router, which screwed things up with my computer. It is crazy that Plantronics doesn't allow you to change the channel permanentally on the phone!"
4,"Good phone, but headset needs frequent replacement","I've had this phone for about 2 years, and it's worked well. My only complaints:1. I've gone through 2 headsets. I finally bought a different headset (a Panasonic), and hope that it lasts longer than the Plantronics.2. I get terrible static when I get near my cordless mouse, and it even renders the mouse unusable.Other than that, I'd recommend it."
4,COOL CORDLESS,"I love this device. ITS SMALL,CUTE, AND PORTABLE.The only thing is it dies too quick, i use it for business purposes and THE PHONE starts notifying me THAT ITS DYING ABOUT 3HOURS FROM THE TIME I STARTED USING IT( I GUESS THATS STANDARD FOR A CORDLESS PHONE). ALSO I DONT LIKE THE STATIC I GET WHILE ON EVERY CALL. BESIDES THOSE TWO THINGS EVERYTHING ELSE I LOVE SO MUCH.I LIKE SO MUCH, I WILL BUY ANOTHER(I WILL BE SWAPPING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WHEN ONE DIES) BUT THIS TIME A I WILL PURCHASE A BRAND NEW ONE TO SEE IF THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE."
2,"WI-FI KILLER, SHORT BATTERY, CAN'T BE HEARD","After spending $[...] bucks for this phone I expected a whole lot more. This unit sucks and I will never buy another plantronics product again.First off I work from home and get sick and tired of knocking out every wireless device everytime a call comes in. I had inteded on using my laptop on some workdays but this ""Wi-Fi Killer"" has me stuck using on my desktop.Secondly, why do I have this phone when after only 1 hour of talk time I have to switch back to my handheld phone.Finally, why is it every other caller tells me to ""Speak Up"" because they can't hear me. If this phone would last a full 8 hours of talk time I would probably get laryngitis from yelling into the mouthpiece all day.Plantronics has made a high priced piece of crap pawning it off like it is some great headset. I'd have been better off buying a $39 dollar cordless phone with a headset jack."
5,PLANTRONICS -THE BEST PHONES,"I have used Plantronics phones for 10 years now and I have never been dissapointed, specially with the CT-10 (my first plantronics) and CT-12 models which are perfect for work and personal use. This is by far one of the best phones!"
3,Adequate - but not high quality,"This phone was a replacement for a Radio Shack hands-free phone I had previously -- and it doesn't quite measure up to what I had, but that old one was no longer available. Nevertheless, it does do the trick, it is adequate for my ""hands free"" needs. One problem - the keypad is tiny - similar to a cell phone - and not intended for those of us who have any difficulty seeing itty-bitty print or pushing teeny tiny buttons! That can be aggravating. The headset is, again, adequate - but not high quality. There is a clip on the phone to hook it to your belt for true hands-free use, but the clip is small and does not hold snuggly -- so I don't completely trust it will work. Rather, I put it in my pocket to keep from having it drop off the belt loop, which it has done. I had trouble finding a hands-free phone again, so I'm grateful to find this one -- just wish the quality were a bit better..."
3,not a total working product,"I received all in one piece and was easy to install! only problem I have is that the firefly on the headset is not lit and doesn't work and also the over ear peace - not great instructions how to use - so not using that - afraid i may break it. overall the unit is great - just don't like spending that much money for something that doesn't work 100% and is brand new!disappointed,Nancy"
3,Helpful,This publication was helpful to me while I learned about the current world and US population and many of their aspects.
2,evil town,"typical 1980's ""b"" movie ...lynda weismeier talentzz r shown...saw this yearzz ago ...the price wuz right ..."
5,Excellence!,"I found this recording to be faithful to Hindemith's score and his intention for Morder, ""Hoffnung der Frauen"", one of the composer's three Expressionistic shock-operas. Not only is the performance majestic, disturbing, and thoroughly enjoyable, but the liner notes are scholarly and insightful. This is a wise purchase for anyone wanting to better understand musical manifestations of the Expressionist art movement in Germany at the turn of the century, or a fan of Hindemith who seeks a broad picture of his stylistic evolution. This is not the Hindemith of 1940!"
1,ELIZABETH AT HER WORST!,"I have adored Elizabeth Taylor since I was a child. She was one of the most beautiful women who ever lived. She may not have always behaved as modestly as some would have wished. IF anyone had a hired a photographer to put together every BAD photo of Elizabeth Taylor they could not have done a better job. There are 1 or 2 photos of Elizabeth that I would have actually torn out and framed....but for the most part...If Elizabeth were alive she would have filed a lawsuit. I purchased the book ""My Love Affair with Jewelry"" many years ago in the SALE BOOKS section of Barnes N' Noble and it is STUNNING. I paid a couple of dollars for it and now I see them with ASKING prices of hundred's up to a thousand dollars. I should have purchased twenty of these when I had the chance. SAVE your money on this one. It is just AWFUL despite having a Brilliant Cover Photo"
3,Could be better,"Being that the author knew Elizabeth Taylor so well, the photos could have been on a more upscale tone. Some very mediocre photos when we all have seen gorgeous photos of a gorgeous lady. Somewhat disappointed."
4,beautiful!!,very nice book amazing pictures and beautiful subject!!!I just hoped to see more color photographs but it was really a pleasant journey..
4,Beautiful but flawed,"While the pictures in this book are rare, beautiful, and intimate, I was disappointed that the editors did not catch two errors regarding Dame Elizabeth's fabulous jewels. First,the Krupp Diamond's name, now known as the Elizabeth Taylor Diamond, is misspelled (""Crup""), and most importantly, the beautiful picture of Elizabeth wearing her suite of emeralds, a gift from Richard Burton, is credited as the ""rubies"" gifted her by ""Mike Todd."""
4,I like it but was not impressed at first,When i first received this kit it gave me 2 mushrooms. I got a few grins from people around ($16 a mushroom!). But then i dried it according to the instructions and started it again. It gave a bunch more mushrooms. I am enjoying it and planning or drying and starting it again. Even if it does not produce any more i have enjoyed it enough already to give it 4 stars.
2,Didn't grow,"I don't care for this mushroom kit. When it was time to open the bag it came in, the mushrooms started to form in all different colors, not like a shiitake mushrrom is suppose to be. I had to throw it away due to concern about what kind of mushrooms they really are."
1,Shitake Mushroom,I waited a long time to write this review I did not get one mushroom from this patch. I will never waste my money again!
2,Poor Customer Service,"I had a problem with lack of mushroom production when using this kit. I e-mailed the vendor several times, asking for advice. I have not gotten any help.VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!"
2,a single fantastic mushroom,"Followed the directions but only got 1 mushroom to sprout. to the company's credit, it was indeed a really fantastic mushroom, certainly the best i have ever eaten, with texture and nuance of flavour that really beat any other. how i wish i could have more of them! Alas, i only got one. On the second flush i was plagued with mold. It seems to be very difficult to get the humidity just right -- too dry and no mushrooms, too wet and you get mold, and there isn't much room between those two states -- if there is any room at all."
2,Problems: seller never got backto me,"My log developed mold spots on it (due to excess humidity?). I wrote to the seller to ask for advice and to see if I could salvage it(at the email address that came with the log) and never heard back. I ended up tossing out the whole thing. A waste of money. :-(The log did grow a large amount of mushrooms (though, again, inedible because contaminated by mold.)"
5,Always excellent,"I am so puzzled by other reviews that are negative.I have grown Shitakes from their kits for many years and have always been pleased.Numerous times I have called them, at times for guidance, general questions or occasionally a problem.Their customer service has always been responsive, helpful and fair.The instructions enclosed thoroughly cover any of the issues mentioned, otherwise give them a call.Last kit produced 3 incredible flushes."
1,Ever so disappointing,"We followed the directions to a T, but we certainly didn't get the production they suggest...a few mushrooms, and that was it. The directions were incomplete...didn't suggest things like washing well before handling the medium block... We ended up with mold that weren't mushrooms."
2,10 CD's of Chopin from old 78's,"This looked like the deal of the century. Revered artists playing hours and hours of Chopin. In fact the recordings were mostly from very scratchy 78's with no apparent signal processing. I prefer dynamic range to complete suppression of surface sound, but some of these were really unlistenable. I gave the set to my library's book sale."
4,Worth Reading,"A wortwhile read if you are interested in a period (mid 19th century) piece on education or life in Indiana. While fiction, this book is more important as a historical vignette than as a piece of literature. Additionally, a good description of a spelling bee to compare against Laura Ingalls Wilders' in the _Little House_ books."
1,BEWARE,This set is now being made in China and is poor quality. The glaze looks like jelly. The pictures are blurry. The dishes are not delicate but are heavy and tacky looking. They are not sold with any notice that they are not made in England unless you see the little paper sticker on each piece that states where it is made. The set I bought actually was described in a catalog and web site as imported from England.
4,Mud flaps,THis product was exactly what was described and fit really well on my F250 ford pickup. Did front and back flaps and they both fit well. Took about an hour to install.
5,"Clark And Duhon, Masters Of The Bayou Sounds..","Old time Cajun music is right, and these two old pros Octa Clark & Hector Duhon knew exactly how to play it right, as Octa always said it ""you can't go wrong if you play it right"", Clark rocks on accordion & vocals, Duhon is sure-fire on fiddle, also filling in the gaps on guitar is Michael Doucet. The traditional sound of this genre is the best and without hesitation I'd rank this recording on top with the likes of The Balfa Brothers, Iry LeJeune, Nathan Abshire etc...Clark and Duhon recorded this album, their first in 1981, the original recording is thirteen tracks, the last four on this disc were added and recorded in the same time frame at Doucet's home in Lafayette,La...The Arhoolie co. seems to be fairly consistent in releasing rare and ""old timey"" recordings, similar to Smithsonian Folkways, the audio is excellent including a few liner notes by guitarist Michael Doucet. Take my advice, don't miss this one baby, you're liable to miss the train."
5,The Eternal Aeterna Appeal,"Well it had to happen eventually- an IMMEDIATE contender for my top five ""desert island"" CD list. Demby has outdone even her own high standards and has created a true ""classic"" that grows in importance with each successive hearing. Piano lovers will revel in the simple, poignant way the instrument is used(always audible yet never overwhelming the orchestral timbres.) The Rites Of Passage movement is especially beautifully constructed and is an 18 minute journey that will leave you alternately enthralled, enlightened, amazed, bewildered and ultimately transfixed. Anyone that cares deeply about music should obtain this CD as soon as possible. WARNING: It is habit forming and may need to be attached directly to your hip!! Pure ecstasy at a reasonable price!"
2,Too heavy and hard to handle,"I am sorry to say but I really do not like this whip. The break apart feature in the middle of the whip is constructed of a heavy metal and it is so heavy in your hand that it is really uncomfortable to use. The metal adds considerable weight to the end of the whip and so the whip always feels like it's being pulled down in your hand which is rather uncomfortable on your wrist. Also the two pieces attach just by one fitting into the coupling of the other so the two pieces come apart every so often when I am using it. On the positive side it is good quality and well made, just not the best design."
1,Skip it...content of zero value...,"...Uldrich makes big bucks on the public speaking circuit discussing nanotechnology...I suspect this book was published for no other reason than to provide some ""credentials"" to support the speaking engagements...his most recent books published since this one have been one about George Marshall and another about Lewis and Clark -- real cutting edge technology there!...nope, don't buy it."
3,good but too optimistic,"I found the book a good overview of what nanotechnology is and how it can change our lives. However, his time estimates were wildly optimistic. It is ten years later and we aren't reaping much of the benefits he claimed there would be by now."
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!,"My mom gave me this book for Halloween trying to encourage me to read again.When I pick up this book I'm instantly in Sammy's world!The action is amazing!!!I's scary ,funny, and amazingly good.This book deserves 99,999,999, thousand stars.I've planned on reading all of the books!"
5,The super sluth strikes again!,"This book is wonderful. I have read her first book, and I didn't think The Skeleton Man could be any better, but I was wrong! It is very entertaining and a treasure for any age. A standing ovation for Mrs. Van Draanen!"
3,Packers Banner,"The banner is good size, but one of the metal loops that reinforce the corners broke the first day I used it."
1,Unable to ship item undamaged,"Placed order online April 03, 2011.

5,Sandy in sunny Texas,I have the original 2 volume edition of this set and just couldn't wait to get the updated version. What a treat to have so much information on the White House and presidential families in one place!! You will not be disappointed with this purchase!
5,Reference Books Extraordinaire,"If one has any interest in American Presidential history, this should be required reading and then saving for reference in the future. Lots of little known facts and stories to intrigue the reader."
1,The President's House,"Both books were in brand new condition just as promised. The spines were in great shape, not broken at all. I am so pleased. I would give this five stars."
1,Jim Davis needs to give up,"This cartoon has always been the same : lasagna, Mondays and diets. When I saw how old this book was I couldn't believe it. I thought this stuff was mildly funny when I was 12, but it's just insufferable now. Odie needs to kill Garfield and save us all another 20 years of anguish."
3,Good intentions but not that great,"A brief factual overview of the bad things gone worse in the 20th century. Unfortunately, Laszlo's idea to make things better is driven by a need to keep up with our mad technological race, which is just not conceivable. May be useful as a reference to happenings in the 20th century; otherwise, don't bother."
5,Consistently great quality,"When it's from CTG, I always know I'm getting a great quality cable. It's all basic here, no fancy unnecessary doo-dads."
2,"Burns too hot, and too suceptible to wind","We bought this unit specifically to smoke Kokanee salmon. Unfortunately, this unit burns too hot, and the burner is too susceptible to wind. We have tried adjusting the regulator control valve on the gas cylinder tank and air shutter valve, and still can't seem to hold the temperature below 200 degrees for any length of time. We end up sheltering the smoker in the garage, then the garage smells like smoke. Even the manual does not list temperatures below 200 degrees. So if you are looking for a unit that smokes at a low temperature, pass on this smoker. Save yourself the frustration."
3,Burner sensitive to wind,Mild gusts of wind will blow out the burner so you have to constantly have to monitor it while smoking on anything other than a calm day. My first try at smoked trout turned out very good however.
2,7in1 got smoked,"Product received promptly. Assembly was uneventfull, but instructions lacked in clarity. Upon first smoking dicovered the following:1. At 6 hours used a complete 20 gallon tank of propane and ran out. Couldn'nt complete a 6 lb. brisket, or 6 lb. Pork butt. At 1-1/2 hrs. per pound this was frusrating. Most previous input indicated about 30 hours / tank. Not with this product. Ambient outside temp is 60 degrees!2. The temperature guage is at least 20 degrees off (as many other reviews indicated).3. It is literally impossible to add wood chips after smoking has begun. Not smoker friendly.4. Construction is not for years of service. Carbon steel is extremely thin guage and shows prelimiary corrosion without exposure to outside moisture (stored inside).Summary:Buy another better quality smoker. You will spend far less in the long run. Two tanks for smoking is at least, $20 more per smoke than a good quality smoker. Buyer beware."
3,Could be better,"Had high hopes for this grill, but there's a major flaw. There is no way to control the amount of air going to the coals. The only adjustable element is the vent on top. A 85-90 degree temp outside, full waterpan, and about 3/4 chimney of coal, you are stuck at 300+ degrees till the temp starts to drop. After that, only an hour or so before it's at 200. The coal access door is quite small, so adding coal is done a briquet at a time. The one saving grace is the ability to complete your smoke with the gas burner. This I also use as a high BTU burner for stir frying. If all you plan to do is charcoal smoke, there are much better options at cheaper prices."
2,Masterbuilt M7P 7-in-1,"The unit is disappointing. I purchased it mainly for smoking and occasional grilling. There is insufficient room between the charcoal disk and the water pan to allow adequate charcoal for smoking. Also, the charcoal ashes dropped onto the air vents clogging them and not allowing enough air to enter to keep the fire going."
5,Incredible unit and here's how to fix the yellow flame,"I can't say enough good about this. So versatile, well designed, heats fast, regulates well. Oh, and the food tastes great! I did a 22# turkey on the bottom for Tday with a huge pumpkin on top. It was the best pumpkin anyone had ever eaten and the turkey was so juicy because the water keeps boiling humidifying the smoke.Another reviewer said the flame turns yellow when on low. Mind did also, on high too. Dismantling the burner assembly and shaking the carbon out took care of it. A shop vac might work too.Be SURE to keep adding water!!! It looks like a grease fire would occur if the water boiled out. I add boiling water as it doesn't draw the smoker's temp down."
3,masterbouilt 7 in 1 smoker,"I have owned 2 of these models liked it enough to buy the 2nd unit. The major problem is I needed to contact Masterbuilt, Called customer support several times, My calls were never answered. Decided to try contacting them Via. Email Guess what?NEVER RECIEVED A REPLY. Thinking of buying an electric unit. I bet I won't buy a Masterbuilt"
3,"Ok, but not as good as other Smashbox Products","I'm not sure if the Smashbox Cream Eye Liner I received was old or what, but it is very dry. And when cream eye liner is dry, it just doesn't go on.I love the color and I want to love this product, but I really think I just received a lemon. I have the same Smashbox Eye Liner in another color and it is an amazing product.I am willing to give Smashbox the benefit of the doubt on this product."
3,Lexmark X6170 - Windows 7 Incompatible,I have owned my Lexmark X6170 for several years now operating it on a computer with Windows XP. I have also been able to share it with other computers on my network also running Windows XP. The problem has been within the past year when I purchased a new laptop running Windows 7. I have never been able to share it on my laptop running Windows 7 even with the latest driver. It will not work over a home network on a computer running Windows 7. It will however work if it is connected directly via USB to a Windows 7 computer.
2,Lexmark too complicated!,"I bought this new machine for my office,I needed a Fax conformation,read the book,e-mailed the company finally I got teck support on the phone,this machine is not easy to understand. It took up to much space in my computer and my computer man had to come and re-install the softwear.Costing me too much time,buy something easy to install and use. The faxes are too light coming in and we don't know why,have plenty of ink. Not going to waste 45 minutes on hold,it is easier just to make a copy of the fax darker. Still cant get a copy of the conformation with the time on it.Must make a copy of what I faxed and staple it to the time conformation the machine prints out.Machine is fast and quiet.Need to have extensive knowlege of the computer world to even hook this up, my 21 year old asst.could not do it and she has been working with computers her whole life."
1,Too many technical issues with this model,"As I'm typing this, I'm on hold (yet again) with Lexmark tech support (in India) who tells me that they will have to replace my printer with a new one (or maybe it will be used) due to a defective modem which apparently Lexmark is aware of. This will be my second replacement within 6 mos. The last time, my machine suddenly stopped being able to communitcate with receiving fax machines to send faxes (another problem with the modem). Lexmark won't give a refund. They'll only continue to damage their name and bottom line by sending defective machines out to their customers.It's a good machine that scans and prints ok WHEN IT IS WORKING! I just can't seem to get it working for more than 6 mos. at a time. I'll never buy another Lexmark product again."
1,Major disappointment,"The dates of the 5-star reviews may tell most of the tale: I bought the X6170 about two years ago based on the price, the sheet feeder and my experience with a Lexmark network laser that is now 7-9 years old and still cranking along. From the beginning, the X6170 would suddenly interrupt my telephone conversations and scream a fax tone in my client's ear (Lexmark solution: restore factory defaults -- so helpful). I also noticed that an 8x10 photograph used 20-25% of an ink tank to print. But the final straw was that six months ago (18 months old), the printer began to misfeed paper, either not picking it up (and I assume, spraying ink everywhere inside) or feeding at an angle (something the printer was specifically designed to prevent). It always puzzled me that the paper bin did not contain a single straight edge, making the stack always appear crooked. I would avoid anything that looks like this Lexmark printer (Dell has used a clone of it). I know I will in the future."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"Would have given it 0 stars if Amazon let me - Please read my original comments dated May 31, 2004UPDATE:Well I received the 2nd replacement machine due to experiencing a modem problem AGAIN with this machine. So what happens when I plug the replacement machine up ? THE SAME THING! Lemark sends me another fax machine with a defecetive modem. Whatever you do, don't buy this product. I had to spend an extra $75 just for a spare fax for when my Lexmark machine goes down."
5,Great product at a great price,"This printer offers all of the advantages of an all-in-one device with the added advantage of both a flat bed scanner as well as a page feeder for large scanning jobs. It has a very high print and scan resolution and a wonderful print speed. Finally, it is a very attractive device with an innovative shape and all blue backlit buttons and display (No more standard green LEDs! )"
2,Disapponted,"Iam a graet fan of Corelles and was disapponted wih this product, its neither dishwasher safe nor microwave safe."
2,Storage bowl set doesn't please me,"It's metal; can,t go in micro-wave. It's painted on metal; I'm afraid to put it in the diswaher. Don't think I""ll use these bowls very much"
2,No Dishwasher????,"This 6 piece set was a surprise. They are very small, they are out of what looks like a enameled metal.THEY CAN NOT BE CLEANED IN DISHWASHER!!!!!!!!!!!! What good are they??? they are pretty, but I won't be using them much."
5,John Ozoga Whitetail Intrigue,"I have been studying and hunting Whitetail deer for over 30 years and this book actually contains useful information. Too many times books of this sort are centered on some gimmick to kill the big one. This is not the case with Ozoga's work, you will come away with a deeper understanding of the deer's habits, social order and habitat requirements. Especially for the northern deer herd. For anyone who has an interest in Whitetails this is a must read."
1,Confusing mishmash of psuedo spiritualism,"Masterton is a pretty good writer and I'm willing to suspend disbelief especially when reading horror but this just made no sense. He mixes in a bunch of Native American spiritual mumbo jumbo as well as voodoo which could be fine but there are way too many inconsistencies to overlook. There was no suspense just a lot of gratuitous gore and a really squirm inducing sex scene (yuck!). I read ""The House that Jack Built"" too and it had the same credibility problems. I guess I'm just not a fan of Masterton."
5,"Practical, detailed...","A practical guide to the wide range of techniques used in Indian embroidery, which details ways in which these can be adapted for Western embroidery."
5,An introduction to Indian textiles' historical development.,"This marvellous book includes the influences of local and regional traditions, exploring individual techniques such as quilting, counted-thread work, shisha (mirror) work, metal work, beading, applique and patchwork. A brilliantly written book, that I highly recommend."
3,Too light on detail,"Usually, attending class is required to find out what the professor is going to focus on in the book. Using this book, attending class was required because the book is so shallow, the lecture actually goes into more depth then the book.This is a very introductory text book, and at times can be frustrating trying to go the next step that is needed for comprehension of a concept. If you are looking for an introduction to Game Theory concepts and examples of the introductory games, this is a good book. But once to try to go the next step and start analyzing the boundary cases or a more complicated game, this book will not have the answers."
4,Good Text,"This is a good game theory text book. It focuses on the analytical portion of GT, and presents a good explanation of how the concepts work without requiring an in-depth knowledge of math. This was the assigned textbook for my political theory class, for which the math requirement was HS algebra.If you're looking for an in-depth, math intensive game theory text, this is not your book, but if you're looking for an analytical overview, this book is well written and helpful."
5,I love Easy Connectionse,"I can't believe there are other women out there who read this book as children and it stuck in their memories too! I thought I was the only one! I didn't even know there was a sequel. I read it over and over as a child and the other day was struck by an overwhelming urge to read it again. If anyone knows where I can find a copy, please email me at: infosupply@lycos.com"
5,UNFORGETTABLE,"I too, first read this book when I was twelve and I've been trying to locate a copy for well over ten years. I hope it is re-printed. An unforgettable read."
3,its not okay,i havent read the book yet but i was reading a review Rannveig Thorarinsdottir and rape isnt okay even if u are really sorry
5,I can't believe it!,"I can't believe that so many people from around the world have read and enjoyed this book. I read it about 10 years ago at school and found the mix down to earth characters and heady rock-and-roll lifestyle fantastic. I also read the sequel, and found it be of the same excellent standard. However, my favourite Liz Berry book has to be Mel. It is just a shame that they all seem to be out of print. These are books that I think every new generation should read."
5,My favorite in the series,"How does he do it? Not only were the first two books instant favorites, but the third one became my favorite in the series! More deep storylines, more great characters, more excitement, more suspense, etc. I'm officially hooked on these, and now I get an adrenaline rush when I start a new book by Bryan Davis."
5,Spectacular!,"This is a wonderful book for readers of all ages. Circles of Seven is the third book in the Dragons in Our Midst series. It's a great continuation to the series. It is very well written and thought out, the plot is deliciously complex, and the characters are ones that you come to love. It's combination of fantasy, Arthurian legend, and the Bible make it a unique and fascinating tale! I recommend this book for all ages."
4,Good book for the tweeners.,Great series for Tweeners. Combines the tales of Arther from old with Christian principles. Even my early-teen enjoyed it! Highly recommended.
3,Book for Teen,This book set has been great as we have been slowly taking out the unappropriate books and slipping these in for them to read. Both the boys have been really enjoying them and are now asking for the other sets. The books came in 3 days and they were in practically brand new condition.
4,Yet further...,"My opinion of this book is the same as that of the previous two books. However, I have one thing to say: The most cliche book cover I have ever seen in my life. Other than that, not a bad book at all."
2,The Flick that Bites off More than it can Chew.,"**NOTE**(Actual title is ""Killer @#$%&"")The cover is double-sided and reversible.So you can display it with either title.OK I was expecting a gorier asian version of ""Teeth"" when I purchased this flick.What I got was a cheaply-made,haphazardly-construed, badly-acted, softcore asian porno.I can't really say anything beyond that as this was the first flick I've ever found myself incapable of sitting through.Maybe some day, I'll give it another go,see if I missed any cool gore, or profound creature effects.On the bright side, there were plenty of half-naked, asian chix.A plus, but certainly not a selling point.**You ever have one of those movies you were too embarrassed to even give away.Yeah...........it's one of those.MORAL OF THE STORY:Aquiring an STD,would be less painful,than sitting through 20 minutes of this flick."
2,so so,I really did not like this as much as I thought I would. I really liked the Authority and thought this would be good as a back staory and it really was not. The story was all over the place and you did not get a good sence of the characters. Oh well
4,Christmas,"Okay, so this is not Academy Award material, but it IS about Christmas, and will be added to my Christmas movies collection."
3,Melissa Gilbert fan,"Every since Little House on the prairie, I have always supported her movies. This one is a little weak, but a nice story line. Worth the purchase, will be keeping, but not one of my favorites. Family freindly."
3,The Christmas Pageant,"As I am a fan of Melissa Gilbert I enjoyed this Christmas film (I am also a bit of a sucker for Christmas stories). It is fairly predictable and a bit soppy but a good family movie. The main character (Melissa Gilbert) loses her job and no-one wants to employ her because of her abrasive manner. She is finally offered a job in a small town, to direct their annual Christmas Pageant. Her manner immediately puts people off and she was going to leave but then decides to tone down a bit and eventually becomes accepted by the townspeople. Nothing to rave about but most enjoyable!"
4,Good show!,I have always enjoyed Melissa Gilbert's acting and once again - a very lovely Christmas story! My hubby & I have oodles of Christmas shows and this one is tops!
2,The Christmas Pageant,The Christmas pageant I am still waiting for this item to arrive so at the moment I cannot really submit a proper review.
4,Great!,Oh I loved a young Ian McKellan in this movie. The story of DH Lawrence was fascinating and historically accurate as I study English Lit.
3,janelle taylor is wonderful but this falls a little short.,"This is very difficult to review. The book, as outlined above, started well. Then it got bogged down in detail and description and I wished it would end. BUT...the characters were good and likeable enough that I couldn't abandon the book as I wanted to know what the outcome was. And towards the end it picked up again. It is a very different plot with lots of twists and plenty of western action...more information about running a ranch than I needed.I didn't think the ""romance"" was in any way sensual physically but emotionally there was attachment. I think this book will appeal to some and be a disappointment to others. Or, as with me, some of both."
2,depressing,"I thought this book was very depressing, just one problem after another. Matt Cordell was a nice man, he deserved to marry a nice woman, not a woman that was in love with another man. I do not think people should marry because they ""like"" someone. I do not wish Matt to die, he is nice and he has two children at the end of the book, but neither do I want Navarro Breed to have to live with out the woman he loves. Also it is not fair for Lane to never know his father, when his father is a nice man. I was very unhappy with the ending. And no-way will I ever like a book where Navarro falls in love with a different woman or will marry one just to have a family."
2,A Poor Copy Of Such Other Greats,I thought this series would be as entertaining as the series E'otherwise but sadly I was greatly disappointed. Like a reviewer said the animation while unique was terribly done it seemed like they were trying to do the animation to much like Aeon Flux. The storyline also suffers greatly a first few episodes seem to show a great conspiracy than after a few episodes it just seems to spill into teenage angst and infighting. Even the finale was annoying to me it just made no sense that greatly pisses me off. The voice actors for the Japanese cast did a great job as well as most of the English dubbed cast though there were a few they could have done without. So all I can say is if you're still interested in this series wait for the price to become more reasonable because if you pay more than $40.00 for this than you have gotten ripped off...
2,Seriously Lacking in Many Areas,"First let me say: Gilgamesh is an anime that promises much but never delivers. The animation style is unique, but there are many glitches and often the animation quality dips when the view is farther away.The ending is the worst of the show, without giving anything away, watch Wolf's Rain or Ergo Proxy, the endings are similar but MUCH better. The writing bogs down in many areas.I was intrigued after the first few episodes but the story just falls apart from the second disc onward. We see a bunch of angst ridden children attempting to discover their heritage. More often, the children sit around fuming. By the end, we see 10 Gilgamesh, but really only know one or two.Pros: Interesting conceptCons: animation, story, charactersViewing preference: Japanese with English subs"
2,Great artwork for a slowpaste uneventful anime.,I was soooooooooo disappointed. It wasnt even funny. The story made no sense. But I love the art concept. Jult Warfell
4,I don't know why...,"I don't know why some people gave Gilgamesh one or two stars... there is absolutely nothing about this anime that deserves that little credit. Yes, it takes a certain type of person to be really into Gilgamesh, but even so, the dark, gothic motif of this series is totally different and unique that it deserves at least a 3. I think, if you are aspiring to be experienced in anime, you should definitely have Gilgamesh in your record."
5,Bring history alive!,"I am an 8th grade social studies teacher and have found this a useful classroom tool. The kids have really gotten into performing these plays.There is a nice range here- from Fort Sumter (which is great because it offers a female perspective) to Reconstuction. The plays offer bits of insight into the human side of the Civil War as well as fun bits of trivia. I needed a way to teach the Emancipation Proclamation and the Frederick Douglass play offered views from both the north and south as well as white and African American. I am also happy to say that generally quiet students participate with the plays. Some parts as quite large others just two lines. This really works well with a mixed class and offers good ""sparks"" for wrap up discussions.It was nice to see my students think about these people and events and even relate a little bit!"
4,A Big Hit,A nice everyday earring. I get at least one compliment when I wear them and they always ask where I got them. Will be getting more for gifts.
5,Wrapped in White: Visions of Christmas Past - John Doan,"A beautiful, fascinating combination of classic music songs. Notes have a lot of information about the instruments used and history of the songs. This should be part of everyone's Christmas music collection."
1,When did these writers take these ships?,"Many of the ship reviews are terribly out of date and don't sound anything like the ship is today. As a travel agent who specializes in cruises, I am distressed when a client brings this book in to plunk down money on a ship that is nothing like the authors portray it."
2,It works after wire cutting,"This UPS does work, but the supplied plugs did NOT fit my AT&T; phone. It was necessary to cut the plug from the AT&T; brick and connect the plug to one of the supplied plugs. I had to make sure the polarity was correct. I can't figure why there was not a plug for an AT&T; phone. This is not an off-the-wall phone.Once the correct plug was connected and energized the installation was very straight forward. Because of the plug problem I can't give this product a higher rating.I could not find a chart showing what phones this unit will fit.Use caution when purchasing."
1,Discontinued by manufacturer,"When I received the product it had only 3 power tips, not the 4 shown in the picture. Looked at manufacture date and it was 2002! The manufacturer lists it as a discontinued product.[...]Tips did not match my new Panasonic phone and voltage settings do not match either. A good idea as I cannot find any other small battery backup but unfortunately in my case a refund was in order."
1,Incompatible! Old technology.,"Incompatible with Panasonic KX-TG6513B DECT 6.0 PLUS cordless phone. The unit's date of manufacture was 2003. Nine years ago. The plugs are incompatible with the newer Panasonic cordless phones which operate at 6.5 volts DC. This unit operates at 6.0 volts. It may work with some older or other cordless phones, but not with the KX-TG6513B. Returned to Amazon for credit."
2,Didn't work with Panasonic Phone,The Panasonic phone that I use (kxtga641) runs on 6.5 volts. The Cyberpower doesn't offer that voltage. Had to send it back. Amazon credited my account no problem.
1,Be Careful with This!!,"Cool device and works well if used mildly. Do not let the battery drain fully because the recharge is dangerous. I measured the temperature of the case as it was recharging and it was 80*C, then it made a big spark and I unplugged it and will not use it again. Also note that my specific device as well as a friends were both manufactured in 2002. I am not in favor of using a 8 year old device that I bought as new that is going to overheat and spark. The manufacture agreed to take mine back."
1,Piece of crap,"None of the cords or the voltage matched the phone system I was going to use it on. Over a year later when I got one that matched, the system didn't work at all. NO JUICE whatsoever. Of course it was well past warranty or return time so I just had to junk it."
5,Power my Network,"Hey these things are great, I bought three of them, I first bought one for my mom's cordless phone up stairs so that if the power went out she would still have her telephone. I then realized that I could use these devices to power my cable modem and my wireless router and they work great. They haven't missed a beat and my Internet hasn't stopped working even when the power goes out. I use one power saver on the cable modem and the other on the wireless router. Tomorrow I'm going to go to the store and buy one of those magic jack's that you see on TV all the time and refit an old laptop computer that I have as a phone server and plug the magic jack into that and then tell verizon where they can stick their phone bill. (Magic jack is much cheaper than verizon.)"
5,Wow!,"This is the 2nd Bombshell book I've read written in the 1st person, and I LOVED it! Trust me, it really helps when it comes to the suspense.This book is action-packed (the kind that keeps you up all night cause you can't put it down) witty, engaging, suspenseful, and enough to make me impatient for her sequel! A definite keeper."
4,Entertaining for children between the ages of 6mths to 18mth,"I was introduced to this video by my sister who has triplets. I found this video to be very captivating for children between the ages of 6mths to 18mths. And, the music is enjoyable for me to hear in the background while I'm doing my housework. My son seems to enjoy watching the closeup shots of other young children playing plus the bright colors. This video, as well as ""Baby Its You - Multiple Madness"", both seem to captivate my 9mth old sons attention for the duration of the tape. I've tried other cartoon videos which he is not quite interested in yet."
3,Good overview but lacks depth,"This book is big and covers a lot of territory. It does a very good job describing how to use OS X, the pre-installed applications, and keyboard shortcuts. By far the best parts of this books can be found in highlighted and 'tips' sections strewn throughout the text.Unfortunately I found this book lacking in details. For example the Keychain feature, which is like a lock box for passwords and other confidential information, is only given ~3 pages. Because applications can query this information and there's no real analog in other systems, I feel that more text should have been devoted to this feature. Fortunately the NSA had the information I was looking for in their ""Securing OS X"" document.Over all this book has everything most users would want to know. However, if like me you're looking to get under the hood this book won't get you there. This book gets 3.5 stars; it's not a replacement for a tech manual, it's verbose and yet still misses details."
4,Great Selection!,"This book definitely has an amazing selection of pieces from old and new musicals alike. Everything ranging from Carosel to Rent. Althought it is quite pricey, Amazon.com has been able to reduce it greatly.- A definite ""must-have"" for all you theater buffs out there!"
2,"Good Book, but not worth the price","This book had quite a selection of songs, but it wasn't really worth the price. If you need it though, Amazon has it the cheapest I've ever seen."
2,Broadway Fake Book,"I really love all that this book contains, but it was poorly bound and fell apart the second day I had it. There are so many pages due to it's hundreds of songs, but the technique used to bind the pages together is less than impressive."
3,Contents Great/Binding Bad,"The contents are much improved--great songs that were not in previous editions (""Somebody, Somewhere,"" ""Stars,"") as well as newer shows. But the binding started to separate within the first 2 days of use!"
4,Re-bound my copy,"Great content -- I help students find audition songs, so this and Hal Leonard's new Broadway anthology are terrific, efficient, wide-ranging sources.What's wrong: plastic comb binding fell apart the day I got the book. Comb bindings don't work for 800+ pages. I took mine to a copy shop, had them drill-press three holes, and now have it happily in a 3"" looseleaf binder."
2,a step down,"I have been using the jet boil integrated set for a while - I love it. Then I decided it might be nice to cook eggs & toast bread when backpacking. This pot sits on top of the burner using an adapter. I find the adapter to be clumsy & awkward to pack because of sharp points that catch any material sacks you put it near/in. The pot does not sit solidly on the burner especially when the handles are extended. The finish is not anti-stick so a lot of grease has to be used while cooking. Even though I did, the metal was stained on the first use. Not a good addition to my outdoor cooking equipment"
4,Love it!,"I have to disagree with a lot of the negative reviews - I really like this crockpot a lot....the shift-to-warm feature is wonderful, as are all the programmatic functions. The lid fits just fine, and the pot is nice looking as well (yes, it's kind of big, but it's supposed to be! It's all pot, not additional packaging). I do agree that the recipes should be in a book, but, with that said, the recipes I've made so far were lousy anyway - very bland. So, the recipe function is an add-on that may be nice on principle, but not a reason by itself to buy the pot. Buy it for its digital capabilities, design and volume."
2,Not the best book on the topic,"I bought this book because it was the only one on the market at the time. While the writing is clear, the coverage is pretty thin. In the end I didn't feel that I could do all of the things that I wanted to get CourseBuilder to do. On the other hand, the book Using Dreamweaver to Create eLearning was extremely thorough and well written. It showed how to get the most out of the product and the examples were relevant to the interactions that I needed to build."
1,Worst book I have ever bought from Amazon.com,I have bought 40 to 50 books from Amazon over the years. This is the first review I have ever written.This is a poor beginners book on Coursebuilder. It is too confusing and leave you hanging in the wind at crucial moments. I e-mailed the author and recommeded she read the H.O.T. book at ...before writing her next book. Lynda knows what users need and how to present the information.A good book would be great to have. This is not it!
1,It takes all sorts,"This is one of the most disappointing technical manuals I've ever read. For a start it's poorly edited. There is loads of redundant language, saying the same thing, in different ways, repeating and repeating (you get the point?) And, as other people have pointed out, some of the examples just don't work properly. However the real problem with the book (described as Intermediate to Advanced) is that it spends 260 pages on the 'easy' part, setting up the Interactions, and then tries to deal with the hard part of scoring, tracking, learning management systems and connecting to databases in 70 pages. That's just not enough, what's written is not clear and you'll learn far more from the on-line help."
2,Another text written more for the author than the user,Like many of the texts that pretend to be training manuals this one could have used consultation from a non-technical person. Descriptions of Coursebuilder are fine but the learning projects are very poorly designed. There are significant gaps between steps and errors in instructions that should have been resolved before publication. Perhaps a third of the book is worthwhile....
5,Very Helpful,Have been trying to learn to use CourseBuilder and Learning Site from the product documentation and was not making a lot of progress. Then along comes the solution to my problem. This book helped me to get my project started and working. Wish I would have had the book a year ago.Good work Donna!
5,"Barbara Cook, Josh Groban & Audra McDonald","I was lucky enough to be there for the actual concert and I can honestly say that this CD makes me feel like I am there all over again. Ms. Cooks voice is as impeccable as ever, cutting to the emotional heart of each song. Yes we've heard Ms. Cook sing most of these in the past, but the extra special setting of the Metropolitan Opera infused Ms. Cook (and the entire evening) with an added spark that was palpable and clearly evident on this recording. This is not to be missed.My only complaint is that Elaine Stritch's performances were not included on this recording as the two really played well off each other. But no worries the duets with Audra McDonald and Josh Groban are also very compelling. Listen especially to the duet with Josh Groban which is acted so well by both. It's songs like this that make me wish Barbara could be in a musical again."
5,Barbara Cook at The Met,BUY IT! She is a classic and so is this CD. Eric Stern works with Barbara beautifully and brings out the best in this wonderful CD!This will NOT disappoint any fan!
4,creamer/gravy boat,Love it! Even though it is no longer made in England. It is well made and beautiful. I love to serve cream/milk with tea to my quests.
3,Good for a general overview of Mr. Jackson,"If you're interested in a general overview of Andrew Jackson and the more notable events of his life, this book is fine. While presumably accurate, it presents a superficial summary that doesn't seem to be particularly insightful."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I bought this about 5 months ago. The coating on the plates started coming off within two months and is now gone. It is unusable. It snags and pulls your hair. I've owned several straitners, this is no better than the $20 straitners. Actually, I think the cheap straiteners last longer. I wouldn't spend this much money on this product."
3,It broke down!!,I liked it but the cover on the plates didn't last much and after 8 months it never worked again!!Don't spend your money because you gotta replace it within a year! :(
4,Good for light use,"I use this straightener a few times a week just to straighten my bangs and get rid of some frizzies (I have medium-wavy hair). It works perfectly for that! I don't know how useful it would be for a full-head straightening for very curly hair on a daily basis. However, if you need it for light or occasional use, this is awesome. I bought my mom one as well, since she likes to straighten her hair for special occasions."
2,Does the job but very BASIC,This was the least expensive I could find but the plastic is a little light. I have an under 10 lb dog so it works for him but it's very small and light. THe small is only good for VERY small dogs who don't push their food bowels.
2,disappointed,"I have been searching for new bowls for my cats. I have two bowls, that I have had for years. My mistake was trying to find similar bowls in this new market. The dimensions given are unclear, turns out it is for the base, not the inside of the bowl, so they are too small. Made of pathetically lightweight plastic, you can almost see through it. I considered sending them back, but with return shipping costs, it is not worth it. I'll just donate to the local thrift store, maybe someone else will want them."
4,Lexmark X6150,"I have had this time item for about a week and a half now. It is a Great printer, scanner, and copier. The one problem I have with it, is I set it up to print 2 sided cards and it prints the second side upside down. I am still trying to correct this problem."
4,"Years Later, Still Ticking","I bought this printer around 6 years ago as a replacement for a bundled printer that came with my computer. At that time the Lexmark X6150 was a fairly feature-packed and high-end model, but was worth the money. It ran loud but solid, and did all of it's tasks with ease and simplicity. Fast forward to today and this All-In-One is still printing/faxing/scanning/copying dutifully, even in the dank and dusty conditions of it's basement lair. Yes, the ink is still expensive. Yes, there's 1000's of better printers out there today. No, there's still no way to connect it to a Mac. Despite all of this, after years of abuse, it still works just fine. If you happen to stumble across one of these at a yard sale or something, nab it."
1,Do not purchase this printer! Buyer beware!,"We have had issue after issue with this all in one. Customer service for Lexmark is terrible. Unless you want to spend hours and hours of your time on the phone with lexmark customer service, find another printer!"
1,Worst purchase ever!,"I purchased this printer in June and within two weeks of receiving it, it stopped working. It kept saying there was a paper jam when there wasn't. I called tech support and had to go through hoops with them to PROVE that it was defective. They finally sent me a replacement (which was dented and scratched up, obviously not a new printer) and after a rew days, it started doing the same thing. I contacted them again and asked for a refund. They stated that they dont' do refunds. At the moment, it's been six months since I purchased it and it's only worked for about three weeks of that time. This is a terrible quality printer. What are the chances of two random printers giving the exact same error message?"
1,Bad design/ poor quality,"I bought this printer in december. All was fine until it had a paper jam. In the process of the paper jam it knocked off an encoder strip. Now I get a hardward error code 502. Cleared the jam but now I have to put the strip back on. Call Lexmark and they tell me to try to put it back on. Not easy, damn near impossible.Since my printer is under warranty.They said they were going to send me another one. A used one. All I want is mine fixed. Instead they're giving me a used one, refurbished. Mine is damn near new quality.And I'm getting a old. Bad business, I will never get another lexmark. They are too disposable for me. Bad design and quality."
1,Paper Jam Issues,"Bought the printer four months ago and one night it would no longer feed the paper thru. Conacted Lexmark Customer Service and was given a whole long list of checks to do. I was still getting the Paper Jam error. Lexmark sent a new printer and it also gave the same paper jam error from the start. I bought a new USP cable and checked all connections, reloaded the software twice. Still the paper will not feed and the paper jam error shows up every time. Going out tonight and buying a Canon Printer. Doubt Lexmark will give a refund, so one printer will end up in the trash and the other retuned to Lexmark in Ohio."
4,Ignite origins,"This album is the spark. It's all emotion and none of the later more composed style. They went through a score of different singers before settling on Zoli Teglas, who I like, especially ""In my time"". I had the privilege to hear the ""Scarred for life"" album with Zoli's powerful voice right when he started out and it was magic. About seven people in the crowd, but the music wouldn't be denied. Ever since this album I expected Ignite to top it and technically they did, but as far as impact goes it stops right here. You can't beat the desperation trying to claw it's way out of the singer's chest. Repeat city."
2,before Zoli... watch out,"i haven't heard this album in like 14 years, but this is their early material with a different singer who is nowhere near as powerful as Zoli Teglas. if you wanna take a chance go ahead, but caveat emptor!"
3,"Mildly amusing, but not as great as other reviewers claim.","I don't know why this got such rave reviews. It was ok. It held my interest well enough that I read the whole thing. I love Laurie Notaro and David Sedaris and was hoping to find something similar with this book/author, but I didn't. I'll have to keep looking."
5,Juggling with Joie de Vivre,"Hilarious, heartfelt and with more moxie than a locomotive, Hillary Carlip's memoir is a must-read/must-have/MUST-MUST for all. Ferociously fresh. Infectiously inspiring. When one door closes, Hillary builds a dozen windows and several skylights... and takes us along as she trampolines up and out with no net below.Indomitable spirit is an understatement. You'll find yourself howling with glee, moved to tears and cheering enthusiastically every page of the way. I didn't want it to end. Please, please say that there's a sequel."
1,GOOONNNGGGG!,"Based on the other glowing reviews of this book, I expected to love it. I didn't. I expected it to be funny and insightful. It wasn't. It was boring. I actually chose it as a selection for my book club and then had to retract it after finishing it, because it doesn't provide any interesting material for discussion. This is the first time I have reviewed a book, and I felt compelled to do so because my experience of the book was so different from the other reviewers'. Ms. Carlip apparently has many talents, but writing isn't one of them."
5,I wept cuz it was over,What a riot! I had a blast reading this book and wept when I finished it cuz my ride was over. Will there be another? I believe there are still several years that were not discussed. The humor - the story telling - the historical antidotes - all fun and heartfelt. I would recommend this book to anyone that is breathing.
5,It's a thrilling roller coaster ride...,"Reading Hillary Carlip's Queen of the Oddballs is as exhilarating as a roller coaster ride at your favorite amusement park. As you travel the rails, spotting cultural milestones with each dip and turn, you'll grow giddy from Carlip's loopy landscape below. Hold on tight as she shares her adolescent sleuthing, fan fervors, and crazy disguises. And when the ride softens, during poignant love affairs, family reminiscences, and self-doubts, you'll stay aboard, wishing you could've been there to hug your new friend. And you'll be grateful Carlip hoarded mementoes, photographs, letters, and artwork, and for her generosity in sharing them with readers. Queen of the Oddballs is a great ride. Don't miss it."
4,oddballs get even,"I picked this up at 6pm and when I looked at the clock, it was 3am and I'd finished. Hillary Carlip is completely posessed/ blessed with the knack of making real-life 'unputdownable'. (It probably helps that she's had an incredibly off-beat and interesting life.) The only thing that disappointed me was a sense of bitterness that appeared out of the blue in the final chapters - perhaps it was her relevation about why her relationships were such disaster zones, but it did feel a little uneven. Still, she's a fantastic writer and this made me feel nostalgic for a time and places I've never experienced in my own life...I straight away wanted to re-read 'A girl's guide to taking over the world', AND find a copy of 'Girl Power'. Oddball = awesome."
3,"Some good ideas, some fluff","Our daughter already goes to bed at 7:00- she's only 9 months old- and I had always assumed that her bedtime would get later as she got a little older. This book has inspired me to try to keep her bedtime earlier for as long as it seems to work. That said, the informative content in this book that is specific to sleep could probably have been expressed in a detailed magazine article, or a single chapter in a longer book about sleep. There is a lot of filler in the book, some of which may be interesting to some readers. However, if you really want to know more about children's sleep and how to deal with sleep problems, I recommend looking for a different book- something more detailed, such as Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child by Dr. Weissbluth.I don't recommend purchasing this book because you can get the gist of it by simply picking it up at the bookstore or library and flipping through it for 10 or 15 minutes."
3,"Good ideas, but impractical for working parents","We're in Silicon Valley. No person in high tech gets home before 7. We eat at 7:30. We hang out with Daddy until 8:30. Bed is at 9.They get up at 7:30. They take naps from 3-4:30.She has nice ideas, but her schedule is highly unrealistic for most of the working world."
2,The listing is wrong and deceiving,"These pads are okay for a light day. The title says (4 Packs of 250). They would be a good deal. They send you 1 pack. That is not a good deal. After complaining, they sent me one more box. That is still not the listing. I would not recommend this product."
4,Great overall organizer,"This is a good quality organizer, at a good value. I appreciate the neutral colors, and I have had no problems using the velcro fasteners to affix this to the changing table. The middle compartments could be a little larger, but overall this is a great way to keep some essentials close at hand without cluttering up the changing table."
1,Dont FIT in every CRIB,"Besides the fact that the straps wheren't long enough to hold on to my son crib, it ended up on the floor every other day!!! Save your money and don't buy it!!!!"
4,A Must-Have For Me!,"As others have said, this product is a bit flimsy, but I solved that issue well enough, and it works great for me! Instead of strapping it to something, I use nails to secure it on the wall!I cloth diaper, and CD'ers know how much space all those bulky diapers can take up! My son gets into everything. He especially loves throwing laundry around if he finds any. He also loves to move around small furniture items, such as changing tables! So, this product is a life-saver! I secure it to the wall with nails, and this holds everything I need, while keeping it far from the baby!And it's a great price! To put it in perspective: It costs less than most diaper stackers I've seen, holds 3 times the diapers, plus other accessories."
2,Just okay,"This organizer is great in that it straps to the back of a chair. I keep it on one of my dining room table chairs and I keep a changing pad on the table. But the top two shelves are useless. They don't have sides, so they can't hold anything. Manufacturer should put sides on the top shelves in the future. Also, the mesh cubbies at the top are pretty small and don't hold much."
5,Baby Shower Gift,WHO: Bought this for a baby shower giftPROS: Great priceCONS: No complaints as yet so she must have liked it.
3,"It's decent, but not great.","Would be nice if the velcro was longer - it barely reaches back around when you try to attach it to our crib so I'm looking for another way to attach it, and it would be nice if the material was wipable/washable. But it does have plenty of storage space"
1,Don't Bother!!,"I got two of these as shower gifts. I thought that they would be so handy. WRONG! The velcro kept slipping and sounded as if it would fall off of the changing table. The openings that are shown holding the powder and lotion are VERY small. They will only hold the travel size or the next size up. It was made cheep. The ""shelves"" are not sturdy at all. Save your money!!"
2,Don't bother... there are better.,"This product will only hold light-weight items. You can use the four little pockets at the top for small itms, and the lower shelves are fine for diapers. But don't plan on storing wipes, vaseline, powder, lotion, or ANY other items heavier than a diaper on any of the shelves! They will just slide off, no matter how you position them. Just not worth it."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed to find that out of 11,001 names for African-American children, there weren't many I found that were African-American based. Though just about every name in the book was a name of at least one African-American, many had European roots. The names I found most interesting (under the new name section) had no meanings and naming my child with a name that has known meaning to me is very important.It's also a little outdated. Khalid Muhammad is listed as a national representative of the Nation of Islam and anyone who's up on current events knows that that fact is no longer true."
3,"I am based in England, so black name books are hard to find","This book had many Afriacn America names, I was pleased that my own childrens unusual names were in there also, will be passing this book on to family member who become pregnant."
2,"Useful photos and drawings, but poor scholarship.","Diehl provides some useful measured drawings for those of us who can't make it to the V&A. But nothing is documented (esp. his dubious historical notes, e.g., that seasoning wood was unknown in the Middle Ages, that drawboring was used because they worked with green wood). Modern woodworkers will find it adequate; students of medieval carpentry should steer clear."
5,Just what I was looking for,This has plans that fit what I am hoping to build soon. Kudos to the author for the plans and descriptions of the furniture.
3,Average..nothing special,I was an ok book to have but nothing that stands out. I just bought it as I plan to make some dog biscuits and other book have pretty much the same recipes.
4,fun but inspirational as well,"The story of the Three Dog Bakery and how it came about is heartwaraming and inspirational. Entertaining commentary, too. The recipes for the specially prepared foods are pretty good. I have tried a few of them and my three elderly dogs love it."
3,If it's for personal use,"If you bought this book for personal use then it's a great book but if you bought it to help with a home business, many of the recipes will not last long. A lot of the recipies I didn't think I would use for my personal pet either. But just to say, I like shopping at their stores."
5,Easy cooking for the pups.,"Many great recipes to try. All of my choices, so far, have been easy to manage."
5,shonen jump naruto volume 12 Byakugan Battle,i think Hinata has a secret crush on Naruto but he just doesn't realize it they both we are so good for each other i like her and her cousin Neji makes me want to knock some sense into his mean hatred towards her. i think when i bought one of my season's box sets this was in it but i just like Hinata so much she gets stronger because Naruto cares its so wonderful thanks! Pam :)
2,Watch at your own peril,"I would not be writing this review if I thought that the other reviewers were accurate in their characterization of ""Dance Party USA."" Last night I wasted 66 minutes watching the mind-numbing movie, and I submit this review as a gesture of altruism -- if one person is dissuaded from renting or (God forbid!) buying this film, I shall have my reward in heaven. Trivial plot, inarticulate characters, mediocre photography.... no redeeming features except a short playing-time. -- If this is the future of independent American film-making, count me out. I'll watch ""Touch of Evil"" or ""Gilda"" again instead."
3,A good 1980's guide that's now rather dated,"As with ""The Runner's Bible"", rapid advances in clothing technology, camping gear (backpacks, tents and sleeping bags, and electronic navigation/communications), and footwear have rendered some of the information in this book a bit dated, but it was very good book in it's day, and it helped me prepare for some of the more challenging backpacking trips I went on back in the 1980's.It covers most of the essentials, such as the basics of sleeping and hiking outdoors, the basics of outdoor survival and navigation, food basics, low-impact camping, first aid (esp of the feet), etc.It also offers some information on major trails and hiking attractions, from around the country. Much of that information is probably still good, but can probably be found for free on the internet."
1,Make me want to quit drifting,"If you like drifting at all, do NOT buy this. It sucks a fat one. Literally made me want to stop drifting because I didn't want to be associated with this video."
1,Million Dollar Video Poker,Thought this was a how to book to playing video poker. Instead it was the author bragging about how good he was at the game. Boring!!!!!!
3,Most useful for pro video poker wannabes,"Well written in a chronological diary style, this book describes the tedious life of the professional video poker player. Yeah, Dancer gradually works his bankroll into six figures and stays at the MGM Mansion, but his ""job"" is to play 15000 hands of VP per week and calculate the payback of a casino's latest coupon deal to the hundredth of a percent. If you want to be a pro gambler, read this book! Dancer pretends to be a wonderful, ethical guy, but he spends his days (nights) looking for VP machines programmed incorrectly to pay a high cashback rate. He's like the guy who checks pay-phone coin returns. Dancer is a smart guy, but he doesn't contribute as much to society as he wants you to believe. Still, this is a unique look at full-time casino action."
3,"If you're REALLY into video poker, this is for you","If you really want to learn the best way to play video poker or want to hone your skills, this is a good book. It tells the story of Bob Dancer (a video poker expert) who set out to win a million dollars playing video poker; it also lets you in on how to properly play video poker, there's quite a bit of learning to do if you want to play the game perfectly.Both Bob Dancer and Jean Scott are both considered to be expert of Video Poker and they are two completely different people, I'd recommend looking up both of them. Bob is more brash, and Jean is more easy going and happy, however this is just my opinion."
1,Waste of money,"This book will be very interesting to anyone who is interested in conning the casinos, cheating, and then finding religion after winning at gambling. The book offers nothing in the way of video poker technique. You would do just as well spending the $20.00 on one hand of black jack."
3,Very good if you like Native American,"There are several great tracks, and several not so great tracks, If I were introducing a new listner to Mike Stearns I would not choose this particular CD. Ron Sunsinger is fair and actually detracts severely from this CD"
5,EYE CANDY AT IT'S VERY BEST . . . . .,"This show features some of the most stunning women in""Adult Entertainment"" stripping completely naked, andgiving some of the most erotic dances imaginable.Avery Adams, Tanya James, Lonnie, Breanne, Autumn Austin,Bella Starr, Ashley Fires and Sheena remove their tinyskirts and thongs to give excellent views of theirperfect tight bodies. This is erotic eye candy at it'sbest, with the most stunning scenery I have seen in a""Softcore"" DVD. Very highly recommended."
4,Superior effort from Hot Body,"My faith in Hot Body has been restored....somewhat. I certainly liked this disk much better than the last one I got (Blondes Tease, Brunettes Please). Flirts in Skirts is more of a 1st-rate effort. While the ever-present John Cross is still there, with his, at times, annoying banter, it's at least tolerable. This volume is a good example of what guys pay to see......lovely women showing their all, tastefully done. While featured model Avery Adams is stunning and cover girl Lonnie Waters looks quite nice, newcomer Sheena has to be one of the hottest redheads I've ever seen. And saving the best for last is the sizzling Breanne.You can't please everyone all the time, but I think most guys would be more than satisfied with this DVD."
2,"It's so-so, I guess","I saw this DVD and Naughty Nurses, and I think I liked the Naughty Nurses one better.These Flirts in Skirts girls stripped out of things, and they were pretty, but I wish there would've been a bit more pizzazz to the whole thing. There just seemed to be a piece of the puzzle missing, but I just couldn't put my finger on it.One girl was writhing around on a rug on the floor as she was stripping; and, oh, I don't know, it just didn't seem like it had as much glitz and sparkle as I would've liked. The person or persons who put this all together should've hired a choreographer and got better sets. The thing just seemed like it needed more style or polish....somehow.Some guys will like this because it has PINK, and that's the only criteria some guys have when they see things like this. Yeah, it had P I N K, so some guys will be HAPPY; but, oh, I don't know, I just wanted a little more."
5,This series is great!,"I fell in love with this series as a child and ended up buying all the tapes before DVDs became standard format about 9 years ago. Great family friendly series! My very conservative pastor uncle was insulted by the natives' lack of clothing, but nothing is shown and I find it quite tasteful. They are island people! It's hot! Come on. Your kids are going to be too mesmerized by the scenery and the story to notice."
1,Crap,I can honestly say this was the biggest piece of crap I ever purchased. The producers of this should be utterly ashamed to even link themselves to the Evil Dead title.
2,video would not play,I recieved this tape in perfect condition however it would not play in my VCR. I tried it in another VCR and it wouldnt play there either. The VCRs just kept ejecting the tape. My payment was refunded within a day or two.
3,"Scanner, Copier, and Printer for under $100","At the time this was originally purchased it seemed like a lifesaver.An All-in-One at a great price level.The problem is....If you don't print a lot, say 1-ream a year, the printerseems to take notice..... I may be be overly paranoid.I picked this up at WalMart 2 years ago.I was very happy with it UNTIL....... I had to replace the Black Cart even though it read full ( according to the software ) after less than 200 pages.I did so and guess what?It started acting up aka "" streaking "" the print-outs after only about 3 months.The scanner is excellent...... the printer attached sucks."
1,This printer is NOT worth it!,"I don't know which Lexmark execs wrote these 5-star reviews, but this printer is horrendous! It SUCKS ink from its cartridges ridiculously fast and its print quality is below average. It is nice to have the copy/scan/print functions all-in-one, but not when the quality of the output and the machine are this low. Do not buy this."
1,Don't Be Fooled By the Price,"A great price doesn't always mean good value. First off, the ink for this thing will cost you almost more than the printer itself. Another problem with this machine is the paper: it can't handle more than 3 or 4 sheets at a time or it will become jammed, and/or print crookedly. Not that it doesn't print crookedly half the time anyway! The life of this printer is horrible. I have taken excellent care of it, but somehow it just won't work anymore. This is a bit sad, as I purchased my printer last November and it is now only May. It lasted six months, if that, and between the paper that I had to waste to get it to print straight and the high cost of the ink, this printer is not a good buy. I would advise you to spend a few extra dollars for a Cannon or an HP, because they will last longer and save you money in the long run."
4,GOOD!!!,"I HAVE THIS PRINTER AND IT DOES A GOOD JOB WHENEVER I HAVE IT PRINT,COPY,OR SCAN. I SAY ITS WORTH THE MONEY AMAZON.COM IS ASKING FOR IT. ITS AN ALL IN ONE PRINTER... BETTER IS THE LEXMARK P4350 (its an ALL in ONE also), YEAH I STICK WITH LEXMARK THEY WORK GOOD..."
1,Prepare to spend a lot on Cartridges!,"I just replaced my cartridge, again!!! I'm sure I only printed a total of 20 pages (over estimating). Find a printer that's going to do better on cartridges. You can only buy ""recycled"" cartridges for the black and their very expensive."
1,Lexmarks are terrible!,I just threw my 3rd Lexmark printer out! The ink is so incredibly overpriced and the printing quality is good for 1995--but it is 2010. Really--does the ink cartridge cost THAT much? No! but greed does. I will NEVER buy a Lexmark again! It sucks up the ink at an alarming rate and gives a crummy output. It is unbelievably slow and the error messages never end. I'll pay Kinko's before I ever use another lexmark. Hope you guys go out of business!
3,Very memorable,"My sisters and I saw this movie years ago and are laughing to this day about certain scenes. To us,it is a classic.The musical numbers aren't hits, but the film itself reaches out to young people of different backgrounds. It shows that no matter where in the country or the world you are, we all deal with similar issues."
1,Does not fit your head,"The headphones don't fit my daughter's, wife's or my head. The band is not adjustable and it pulls all the tops of our ears down."
3,Sound quality is great but...,"The sound level & quality is great but the fit really sucks, big time! I'm surprised that Samsung let that happen without any consideration AT ALL to people with large heads. HELLO"
1,Only fits small heads,"I can't give you a review on how these earphones work, because I can't even get them to fit on my big head. If you have anything over a very small head, these will not work for you. I can put them on my ears properly, but as soon as I turn or tilt my head, they pull right off."
1,Completely Useless! Not Made For Humans!,"All the photos show this item spread out like the SBH500 but it actually coils up into a little ball. I unrolled it and tried it every way I could but there doesn't seem to be any way it will fit a human, the neck band is way too small and it keeps rolling back up. There's nothing to hold it on the head either. I gave this to a friend with a small head and he loves it so YMMV."
2,Size Matters,"The Koreans need to spend a little R&D; money on determining the head size of the average American. While the Samsung SBH170 Bluetooth Stereo Headset sports some respectable sound quality, finding a comfortable fit is something like an adult male trying on a t-shirt in size Youth Large. While it may be possible to get it on, it will never be comfortable. One must wonder why Samsung chose a one-size-must-fit-someone approach to this style of headset. It is difficult to believe that none of their design engineers divined the need for an adjustable headband.It is unfortunate that one glaring design flaw ruins an otherwise impressive piece of technology. Pairing was seamless to an iPod Touch, and the sound was quite good. If your noggin is something comparable to that of an eighth-grader, perhaps this is the perfect headset for you. Otherwise, consider something else."
1,Poor qulaity plastic that breaks all too easy,"I love the sound of this Samsung headset, works great for phone calls too.Everything is great but the plastic that is between each speaker. It breaks so easy , I glued it with gorilla super glue, it holds but breaks in in a different place.The plastic is thin hollow to allow the wire to get through to the other side.It has broken three times and is usless. Too bad, I like Samsung products, hope this helps you make a better purchase."
3,easy jazz vocal,"I took a chance buying this CD as I had not heard Ms. Henry before, but I am a big Eddie Higgins fan. The trio provides excellent accompaniment as expected, and I enjoyed the tune selection. The vocal performance was good, but not exceptional. Ms. Henry seems more comfortable in the upper register, and her throat sometimes sounds tight, almost like nervousness. I liked the music more the second time through, which I thought was promising. At this time, Ms. Henry seems to lean more toward Whitney Houston than Ella, and may eventually find her niche in pop. Overall, a good effort and pleasant music that makes me curious about the direction Ms. Henry will take from here."
5,Fantastic Voice!,"I first heard Nicole Henry sing at my church in Hollywood, FL. Her voice gave me chills as it was angelic and powerful. Since then I have been following her music and although I did not think she could get any better than the first time I heard her perform, to my amazement she does. Anyone who loves to be inspired by a pure vocalist with talent beyond ones imagination should at the very least listen to this amazing vocalist sing one song and after that I am sure you will want all of her albums."
3,Social Psychology 5th ed,"This book is very easy to understand, and the real-world examples/analogies are helpful (even if they are a little in excess). It's one of the few textbooks I've bought that I don't consider a (total) waste of money."
3,Southern Tyrol and Ticino,"We purchased this DVD with the idea that it would be a travel log of sorts with classical music as backround. I was disappointed that, despite the wonderful footage, rarely were the locations revealed. We were expecting views of the lush meadows, towering Dolomiti all contrasted against the ancient villages. Unfortunately this was not the case. The viewer travels ridge top to ridge to without visiting the other features that make this part of the world so beautiful.David"
1,Horrible smell,It had a terrible smell. I tried to return it several times and got no response from the seller! I understand you get what you pay for but the smell i making everything in my closet stink!
2,pay attention to the reviews.,discription did not say it was patchwork. my friend who wanted it for a gift loved it. i wanted to send it back. but you get what you pay for.
1,The jacket is not what you expected,"""The jacket is not what you expected, is of low quality, is very small, it's awful, it smells terrible, bad finishes, a complete disappointment. I would like my money back. as they can not sell something that bad. get what you pay. ""."
2,SIZES ARE NOT CORRECT!!!!!! FITS WAYYYY SMALL!!!,"NICE COAT, GOOD QUALITY, HEAVY......BUT.....SIZES ARE WAYYYYY OFFF!!!!!! I ORDERED A 2X AND IT IS MAYBE A L AT BEST XL!!! NEVER GOT TO WEAR IT AND IT WOULD HAVE COST MORE TO RETURN IT THAN IT WAS WORTH! ORDER BIGGG!!!!"
1,Waste of money,"I bought this jacket a couple of years ago. I loved the style it looked good. After having it for only a month, the leather starting coming apart(shoddy stitchwork). Abrasions were becoming very visable and jacket looked worn out like I had it for much longer than a month. It was used for casual wear and should not of fallen apart like it did. I will never purchase anything again from this company! The one I bought sold for $40 from another website but same maker."
1,Won't ship to Alaska,"I was looking forward to getting this jacket, but they cancelled my order because they wouldn't ship to Alaska! Very disappointing! I don't understand why companies won't ship to Alaska. We are not a foreign country, yet we are treated that way by some companies! I hope they are reading this!"
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this item 3 years ago. I ordered an XL and it's more like a medium, so it doesn't fit right. Also, no where does it tell you that it's patchwork leather. Honestly, if it fit I'd wear this all the time, which is why I'm giving it 3 starts. My advice: order one size (or two?) larger then you need."
3,Runs small,This is a very nice jacket but runs really small. I wear a large but I like my jackets big so I can move around. I ordered a 2x and It was to small. The 2x was more like a Woman's Med. It is sort of tight in the shoulders.
1,Very Poor Quality,"I recently purchased this jacket. I knew I was taking a gamble given the price, but I could not have been more disappointed. The zipper was just short of feeling rusty, and the cut and proportion when it's on is hideous. I highly recommend that you spend extra money and buy a quality coat. I can't even give this thing away."
4,Nice-looking leather jacket for the price and quite warm.,"Not a very expensive jacket, and the leather isn't top quality, but it has a nice line, flattering, slenderizing fit with the belt, and is quite warm. I wear an 8 Misses normally, and am 5'7"" and not a petite, and the size Medium was a perfect fit for me, but if you are a 10 or 12, you might want to get the Large. Sleeves were a perfect length."
3,Almost great but with serious flaws,"These have a great fit and are extremely comfortable to stand in for long periods of time. Unfortunately they have (in my opinion) two serious downfalls. First, as another reviewer mentioned, the leather scuffs VERY easily. But since these aren't really dress shoes, and the leather doesn't have a glossy finish anyway, I suppose I could have let this one slide. However, there is also a patch of very rough fabric on the inside of the shoes, near the toe-end of the tongue (directly above your toes). Even with decent socks, this managed to rub my big toe raw within two days (and yes, I bought the right size)."
2,Underwhelming and inappropriate soundtrack,"This is a WWII documentary. It has lots of shots of cannons going off, battleships firing, planes bombing things, and Hilter and the Germans walking around feeling all proud of their silly uniforms.What was really annoying about this video was that the audio didn't have enough commentary and it had way too much loud music. (By loud, I mean that the music was much too loud in comparison to the commentary.)Furthermore, the music was of the annoying and inappropriate ""isn't it great to go off into war"" type that trivialized the subject matter. I kept wanting to just turn off the audio, but then I'd miss the snippets of commentary."
3,Bizarre until the end....,"While reading this book, I absolutely could not figure out what in the world was going on. It was confusing because you are reading about all these different characters and strange things going on, BUT I was truly impressed by the writing ability of Linda Hall because its all neatly connected at the end for a satisfying conclusion. Not my favorite of her books, but its worth reading if you like her style, and I absolutely believe it takes talent to write this kind of story."
3,"Odd, but interesting","Having thoroughly enjoyed all of Linda Hall's books so far, I have found this one to be a bit strange, but I still recommend it. The setting is fairly primitive--an old abandoned church which houses homeless people and how they interact with each other is not exactly my cup of tea, but it still held my interest to some degree. The person guilty of committing murder seemed obvious to me, but there were a couple of twists to the plot that held my attention. Don't expect this to be the best one you've read, but it's okay."
1,Gounod's Faust,"This is an opera on an old VHS tape with very poor visual quality. The subtitles are in Japanese that the vendor did not divulge. The good part is that it only cost $5. Still, caveat emptor..."
2,Not very effective or motivational,"This book is very short and overpriced. The authors seem to take great delight in telling their readers that they will basically remain weak and scrawny and that 17 inch arms is the very, very best you can expect - if that! The information was out dated even when it was first written. The very best book on bodybuilding for hardgainers who want to be mega massive without gear is operation morpheus andOperation Morpheus - Transform your Bodybuilding potential - Drug FreeThe author of that book really knows what he is talking about and is 280lbs gear free to prove it!"
3,Chuck Love - Bring Enough To Spill Some,"It's difficult to argue with Chuck Love's smooth production on his first album, BRING ENOUGH TO SPILL SOME. In terms of club-ready house, you could do much worse than Love's gentle melodies and solid beats. Love brings some unexpected elements to his work (the harmonica in ""Livin at Night,"" the Spanish guitar on ""Something Right,"" or the horns on ""Beatdown"") to keep things interesting, though his music never pretends to be something it's not. The Latin house on ""Bailando"" seems somewhat out of place, but it manages to avoid cheesiness. Love's collaborations with Fourfeet yields some funky tracks, particularly ""Soul Symphony."" When Love takes his mixing skills to the 2nd disc of remixes and extra tracks, it's seamless, as you would imagine, but perhaps suffers from too little variation in the beat. Still, ""Funky-Ass-Beat"" is pretty awesome, though."
1,Beautiful but only lasted about 6 months! Boo!,Pewter cracked and head came off! Save your money! I am still looking I loved the fact of hanging my keys in my pocket I am hooked on it.Mahalo!Joe
3,Weak,"It looks pretty good, though not nearly as shiny as the image; however, the curve of the keychain (the part meant to hook onto your pocket/belt/bag etc.) is very weak and bends easily. It hasn't broken yet, but I'm not expecting it to last that much longer."
3,Old Britain Castles,"The item was not as described in that it was one saucer only - not a set of 4. The picture showed cups and saucers, which misled me into thinking I was actually getting 4 cups and saucers.Having said that though, the seller was most reasonable in refunding all of my costs without any fuss whatsoever. For that I was most grateful. Unfortunately, I have still been unable to purchase the cups and saucers I wanted."
4,"A good book,but not a great book!","I own a copy of this book and I am a bit displeas- ed. It doesn't dwell with using compressors or any effects units. Which is most important,to the home recordist. If there are others out there who own this book,also. I would like to hear from you."
2,Quite dated,"While there's some good info contained in this book about the basics of home recording, overall I would not recommend this book as it's copyrighted 1996 and talks a lot about cassette recorders and Portastudio technology of the time."
3,i guess i expected something else...,"...i expected the book to also weave into the ""mix"" the new digital world with many of these expensive machines now so cost-effectively reduced to computer programs-- BUT, it is detailed and all the basic principles and most terms still apply. it just seems so dated to be giving so much attention to what must have been quickly fading technology like 4 track tape machines even in 1996 (print date...). if you want to do it ""the old fashioned way"" then it seems to be a great book-"
4,Good workhorse printer,"It is not the fastest printer around, but it has worked reliably for me. I use it mostly for black and white document printing."
4,Militia Is Metal Madness,Check out their My Space page to get their newest release. It's hardcore metal. This is some bootleg that was put out and the bands never got paid a cent. Poor quality also. Shame on whoever made money off of them.
3,movie is made for men,"the movie is good, but it is a definetely a guy kind of movie. you can check your brain at the door. the person i bought it from did an awesome job getting me/my husband the dvd, timely, and not scratched. but over all i wasn't too keen about watching strippers all night but my husband and his friends give it 5 stars :) just to let you guys now."
2,Zzzzzz,"The two actresses are good. The movie has been done sooo many times that I had a hard time staying awake. No story line that hasn't been rehashed a zillion times. there were a few moments of comedy between the girls and cat fight (probably stunt doubles). If it were made in English, instead of the subtitles it would have been much easier to follow. No T+A, a couple of teaser moments, but the only nudity was a man (for goodness sake, ugh)."
2,Holiday bummer,"This was not a keeper for me. Some may enjoy it,it is a typical Lifetime movie. Not a bad film, just shallow."
2,dorie,"The story was good but the acting was poor. The story kept shifting from one point to another . I did not get the gist of the story properly. I thought this dvd,s story sounded good when I saw it when shopping at Amazon, but I was left disappointed."
4,Such a good movie!,"This is a good Christmas movie. One of those ""The Grass isn't always greener"" kind of movies that gets you thinking."
2,Holiday Switch,"This movie was very similar to a movie made 1990 with Jim Belushi and Linda Hamilton call ""Mr Destiny"". One of those wish I lived a different life movies. Although I found ""Mr Destiny"" more entertaining, ""Holiday Switch"" had an interesting surprise at the end. I doubt that I will look at this one again."
4,Quite Good. One of the few lower budget Christmas movies I will keep.,"I'm not sure what anyone is saying about not being able to follow the story line. It's similar in concept to Nicolas Cage's movie ""The Family Man."" I thought this movie was quite good and I am very picky about what I keep in my library. It wasn't the best Christmas movie I have but it was definitely worth keeping and watching traditionally."
4,I like this movie. Thanks!,"nice movie, it was nice to see it. Good package, fast delievery, thanks, any time again.Look forward to see movies like this."
2,Didn't Work for Me,It seemed too derivative and contrived. I was never really rooting for the lead character.This flick was a disappointment.
2,Could have been worse,"I love a good Christmas movie, but I definitely thought this one fell into the cheesy over the top category. I liked the story, but there was something about the acting and how it was put together that just fell flat for me. I would watch this one again, but only to have it on in the background while I was doing other things."
1,Rubber ring STINKS,"The bowl is nice, right size, but one of the most important features is horrible. The rubber ring that goes around the base of the bowl (to keep it from sliding around on the floor) has a gawd awful smell that I can't get rid of. It has such a strong rubber smell (like an old tire) that my dog won't eat or drink from the bowl. I have to remove the rubber ring in order for my dog to even go near the bowl. I've tried washing the ring with all kinds of soap and detergent, but the smell hasn't decreased a bit. Without the ring, this bowl is mostly useless because my dog noses it around on the floor. This isn't worth the cheap price. I'd spend more to get a bowl with rubber that doesn't stink up the room."
2,OK...,"This dish is ok. The size is perfect, but there is a rubber edge band around the base that keeps it from sliding around. My lab puppy had the band off and destroyed in about 5 seconds after putting it on the floor with food in it. Disappointing..."
2,A little confused,"I ordered this cat dish because it looked like (and it still looks to me, like) it has a small bowl connected to a large bowl. Well, It doesnt. It is one big bowl. And, unless I received the wrong item, I am a little disappointed and a bit annoyed."
3,Too much Bite,This is too spicy hot and bitter for my taste though my husband liked the kick and that it wasn't too sweet. I personally like the Red Fire bar better as it has just enough kick and the chocolate is less bitter.
3,Santo Fans Won't Be Disappointed!,"This budget DVD-10 from Lionsgate has two El Santo movies: Santo in the Wax Museum(1964, black and white) and Santo and Blue Demon in the World of the Dead(1970, color). In 'Wax Museum', Santo battles a Vincent Price-ish guy who makes wax statutes out of people! In 'World of the Dead', Santo battles a demon who possesses his girlfriend(Pilar Pellicer)! This film predates The Exorcist(1973) by three years. El Santo was like the John Cena or Hulk Hogan of his time; he was a professional wrestler who starred in his own campy movies. Santo movies have detractors(especially with people in the Mexican government)for being mindless camp. In the plus column, 'World of the Dead' has the Funky El Santo theme by Gustavo Cesar Carrion! For Santo fans only!"
2,Caveat Emptor-Let the Buyer Beware,"I purchased this tape thinking that it was a PBS documentary of the exact same title made by WGBH in Boston for the ""American Experience"" series in the late 1980s or early 1990s. It isn't. This is simply a tape of the actual ""21"" quiz show in which two of the most noted of the fixed-quiz-show contestants, Herbert Stempel and Charles Van Doren, squared off in a rigged contest. This story is most ably told by the Robert Redford-directed movie ""Quiz Show,"" which was nominated for Best Picture, and is well worth the viewing. The only value this tape would have is if someone, possibly an acting student, would have the curiosity to see the original show, uncut, as a character study of the individuals involved. From that standpoint, it is of some mild interest, but cannot really come near to the point of desirability to own in one's video library. Save your money unless you're doing a term paper on the subject."
5,Surprisingly pleased!,"I bought this product because I have used other toners in the past with no results. I was hesitant about the price but I am so glad I took the risk! The first time I used it I could see a reduction in redness on my problem area (by the nose and mouth, also a bit on the cheeks). I continue to use 1 drop every morning after washing my face and I would recommend this product to anyone! For me it works rather well, I will buy it again when I run out!"
3,Kitty,It's bigger than I expected so it hardly fits in a backpack. The material is nice and durable though.
1,Not recommended...,"This product took over 4 weeks to arrive and is not what is advertised. First the tray is about half the size as the one in the picture on Amazon. Second, the seeds were not the ones advertised. It seems that the supplier had old seed stock that they needed to move as only about 10% of the seeds they did include are sprouting. This was really a disappointment, especially considering the price. I knew I was overpaying for the item when I ordered it, but figured I was paying for the convenience... lesson learned. I wouldn't repeat a purchase from this seller."
2,Too Tedious For Children,"I got this for ""family movie night."" Some children will be disturbed by the camel birth; almost all children will be bored to tears by the movie. For that matter, so will most adults. The only movie I have seen recently more tedious than this was ""The Brown Bunny."""
2,Staged throughout ... fake ... boring,"I had been excited by the previews and the subject matter of this movie. However, I was completely disappointed by the film. It's a docu-drama, and the scenes were clearly staged. After awhile, I started to feel that the entire story was fake. The entire lulling of the mother camel and her colt with the string instrument and a female vocal scene is beyond believable. The only nice aspect of this movie is that the people filmed are ""natural"" and not familiar actors. BORING. BORING. BORING. I can see how others gave this film 5 stars ... if they appreciate that region of the world BRIEFLY portrayed (infinitesimal)."
1,jesus wept,"This film was so banal i felt like a moron watching it.Still it always makes us chuckle now to remark 'well at least it's not as bad as the weeping camal"" when we talk about films.It was so S-l-O-W. Who want's to see them pottering round their oh -so- tidy yurts? Poor buggers having nothing on their minds but camels.So the big drama is baby(cutsy)camel gonna die cause it can't drink?-so what!Fact is nature can be cruel.And so on and on it drones.Finally the kids get a chance to escape into town across miles of desert cos the baby's white hair is rare:at last some novelty in their lives maybe money.And boy are the kids glad to find t.v.in town!Now having put up with all this so far the documented miracle of mummy camel being affected by human music just doesn't make up for anything.It should. But by then i'm too much in the who cares mode and all i can think is my god is that the only high-light of their lives? Pathetic."
3,Interesting documentary from Mongolia,"The title of this documentary from Mongolia is not a metaphor - there is an actual weeping camel in the movie. Directed by a Mongolian woman and an Italian man who met as students at a German film school and set in the Mongolian steppe, the plot is slight and the directing style is somewhat artless, yet the story is charming and interesting. After a difficult delivery, a mother camel refuses to nurse her young. The camel owners (nomadic Mongolian shepherds, living in a ger in the steppe) send their two children to the city in order to get a violinist to convince the camel, through music, to feed her baby. And the movie allows us to see a particular civilization that is increasingly encroached by the modern world (one of the movie's most poignant scenes had the children demanding their father for a television)."
1,Part of the movie was missing,"I had already viewed the movie. If you're interested in introducing a young person to a foreign film, this is it. I purchased this for a grandchild. When it arrived the box had a big dent/hole in the cover. Before I sent it on I watched it.At the end of the movie the mother camel cries a lot. So much so that the Gobi winds show the camel crying quite a large amount of tears, and these tears are being blown away by the winds. It is really a touching part and touching end to the movie. None of this was provided, and I was so angry at being taken."
5,Really nice video,"This is a very nice documentary-style video. Appropriate for the entire family, and for any age. The video shows what it's like for everyday living for Mongolian nomad, and shows the closeness they have with their animals."
4,Message is clear without understanding the words,The viewer has a bird's eye view of the simple life in a family in Mongolia. They are a tight unit and support each other in all their daily activities. The weeping camel stands out when she finally accepts her little offspring and it is touching to realize that so many of the human race are dying from the lack of love and affection. This really touched my heart.
3,The Story of the Weeping Camel,"This movie, overall, was rather interesting. But the fact that there was no English spoken, nor any captions to tell you what people were saying, left you guessing on some things. It was not a high action movie, either. It was more like someone using a video camera throughout the day, capturing daily life. It is worth seeing once."
4,Good Product,"Great for tattoos, and fairly gentle on skin, just wishing they still make satin, but this is definitely the next best thing."
4,Saved my piecings,"Both tragus piercings were infected and developed keliods, they were painfully ugly. I used the soap for about two weeks, twice daily, for the infection and keliods. I still wash once daily to prevent any issues"
5,Awesome Product!,"This is great for new piercings especially, and if you get any redness or irritation from the piercing, then use this to wash it for a couple days and it clears up great!! It probably depends on the piercing though, I'm not sure, but I had a cartilage piercing and they are really sensitive. So if this works with cartilage then it must work for most! You only need to use a little bit about once a day, so it lasts a really long time. Totally worth the price!"
3,Good but expensive,"This is hands down the best soap to use on a piercing, but for about a quarter of the price, you can get the same stuff at a pharmacy, just get an unscented soap with the same active ingredients."
5,Great product!,I use this on everything from cleaning piercings to cleaning infected wounds on my pets. Works wonders! Have used it for years now.
5,Provon works great,"For some reason I thought it might be a bit bigger, but it doesnt need to be. It lasts long and works welll. I use it yo clean my piercings and they have healed very nicely and it didnt irritate at all. Very good product."
2,Lousy,"I used it, but only the first 15 minutes were of any value to me. The lady goes off dancing without giving enough instruction during the rest of the video."
2,It is probably ok if you are experienced!,"I think it is a good video for intermediate and advanced belly dancers, but I am just a beginner, and I found it very difficult, I think she could have done better with the instructions!! She looks good for being that pg, I admire that."
2,There are better options out there.,"I have been doing bellydance for exercise for several years and love it. It seemed like a natural way to exercise during pregnancy, being relatively gentle and a great way to keep up abdominal tone and also relieve hip and joint pain. The first half of the video is fine, but once it moves to the floor movements, the dancing becomes too complicated and does not have enough instruction to support it. Instead, I turned to the Neena/Veena prenatal bellydance video and LOVE it!"
3,Belly Dance prenatal fitness,The basic of the video is very good. But she jumps from event to event very quickly then expects you to remember everything from the beginning. If you are good at belly dance then it is a video for you.
5,An Excellent Exercise Video!,"This video is well formatted, the movements are adequately explained, and the workout is the perfect length to provide some strenth training and stretching. I really liked it!"
2,not for beginners,"This DVD is not for beginners. Although, with LOTS of practice and patience you will get the hang of it. I wish she would have given more detailed coaching on how to move your hips and legs. Also, it would have been nice to have a slow introduction to the individual moves before moving on to the much faster moves."
5,Great mostly gentle workout!,I LOVED this video. I purchased it right before my 3rd trimester and wish I would have bought it earlier. It's easy to do in loose comfortable clothes (I still can't get the quick moving steps down though). It gets your heart rate up and really stretches your back and hips well. I haven't been able to do it a lot because I have had really bad sciatic nerve pain (from the way my baby is sitting) but really look forward to doing the workout after baby to get my shape back! You can do this video with spoken and shown instruction or without spoken (so you could make up your own steps to the music if you wanted). Excellent video-I think it's a good workout for people that aren't pregnant also!
1,Very Fast and Difficult,"I have had a beginning belly dancing class and still cannot keep up with this dvd. It is extremely fast with minimal explanation. I find it extremely frustrating and am spending most of my time on slow speed frame advance with no sound, trying to figure out what Naia is doing so I can do it, too. I believe that some one with no belly dancing exerperience would be so exasperated by this video they would choose never to belly dance."
4,Awesome book but goes slow,"I thought that the book Cal Ripken Jr. The Only Way I know was a really good book. Because, one it shows you how it feels to be in the majors. Against tough pitchers. Second it makes you feel like you have lived with him your whole life. The third is how I did not like the book. It was very slow going. It went at a very slow pace it was very boring at times. But other than that it was a really good book. Thats why I gave it 4 stars."
4,great book but need some more,I have read better ripken books but I have read worse. The facts were wrong in some parts but others were great. I love the autos very nice. You have to love cal to like this book and I love cal.
3,"""The Only Way I Know""","The Only Way I Know is a good book. IT tells you alot about Cal Ripken Jr. It talks about him as a child, a baseball legend, and a father. I enjoyed reading this book a hole lot. I recomend this book to any Cal Ripken Jr fan. The book helped me understand what it is like being a profesional athlete"
1,Boring,I bought this book hoping to learn about the Cal Ripken Jr. the man...But all I was able to learn from this book is that he is a baseball player. He goes very little into his own life outside of the ballpark. I would not recommend this book to anyone that is not a huge Ripken fan. D-.
2,.225 at Best,"Anyone who has read George F. Will's extremely comprehensive analysis of the game, 'Men At Work,' will be somewhat disappointed by this book. Having read 'Men At Work' many years ago, I may have been jaded thinking Cal would present the same observations at the same level GFW did. Sure, Cal shares his private feelings (family, charity work, etc) with us and an all-to-short analysis of the Birds tumble to mediocrity over the years, however there's far too much time spent on 'boys' stuff (wrestling, practical jokes) and not enough on the beauty and technical-side of the game which Mr. Will brought out of Cal in his book. That said, it is a ghosted autobiograpy (and not altogether too well-edited) and Cal's story, which Cal presented, 'the only way he knows' I suppose. He is, nonetheless, a joy to watch in play."
4,Good biography with poor editing,"To address the previous review, the authors do mention in a later chapter that Ted Williams indeed won the Triple Crown. This is an example of bad editing. The book feels conversational. While that is a good approach, the editors left in too many badly structured sentences that made for difficult reading at times. If you can wade through, it is a great biography of Cal in his (supposedly) own words."
3,Somewhat interesting but the facts are wrong,"In this book the author states that Frank Robinson and Carl Yastremski were the only players to win the Triple crown. If I'm not wrong, I believe that Mickey Mantle and Ted Williams also were triple crown winners. He also says that Davey Johnson won the World Series as manager of the Cincinnati Reds. This is also wrong. Can someone explain this to me."
1,Lexmark makes lousy products,"I've owned two Lexmark printers, and both of them did not last two years. One had problems after 3 months of usage--would not print in black ink. The other one lasted two years, and it also stopped printing in black ink. I've tried installing new cartridges, and I've tried their ink nozzle cleaning program on numerous occasions--it doesn't help to fix the problem. I will never voluntarily buy a Lexmark product, ever again."
3,Costly to run,"In our experience, this printer runs fine. The problem is that ink seemingly cartridges last about two minutes. And the ink cartridges, at this point, have run us far more than the printer did in the first place! When as and if we get a replacement for this machine, it won't be from Lexmark."
1,My review of this product,"Lexmark use to be the king of inkjet printers and once upon a time, it was the only brand I would purchase. Sadly, this company and its products have fallen by the wayside. This printer constantly jams and shakes too much while it is printing. I will never buy another Lexmark printer again. Do not purchase this printer. The top loading document feeder sucks also. It frequently pulls in two sheets of paper instead of one when you click on the print button."
1,"Bad printer, setup was not easy and print quality is lousy","I have a Canon i550 which was much easier to install and quieter than this Lexmark that I received with a laptop purchase. The cartridges are difficult to snap in place, and until they are perfectly snapped in, the printer will not work. Print quality is fair to mediocre. Print speed is slow."
4,Sublime,"Great interpretations of hymns & carols. The interpretation of ""Little Drummer Boy"" is so unique, with middle eastern percussion & scales, that it is worth the price of the recording. In general, great arrangements; there are a few more predictable moments, but overall quite good."
5,Never Disappointed with British Castles! Beautiful and Durable!,"I have been collecting Johnson Brothers Old British Castles for years and have yet to break one dish! This stuff is not only beautiful and elegant, but suitable for everyday use! And we really use our set as it's the only one we have! I once only used it for special occasions but after I realized they never broke even with rough handling, I now use them every day! They clean up great in the dishwasher and none have faded. I have noticed when you buy these dishes separately, they may have a bit more or less color."
3,overpriced for a swim noodle on a stick,"I inspected these the other day and I can't believe the gall of this company. A list price of seventy dollars for a pair? Even for fifty dollars it's insanity and insulting to their customers.Here's how I made 2 ""foam sleeves"" for under $5: Get a 10-foot length of 1/2"" thinwall metallic electrical conduit (also known as EMT) at your local Homers. Saw it in half. Get 2 lengths of the black closed cell 1/2' pipe insulation (also you could use kids ""swim noodles from the dollar store). Put the foam around the conduit and put your zipwall pole under it to hold the plastic barrier tight to the ceiling.For sealing to sidewall - put the thicker version of the foam noodle around the zipwall pole itself and position your zipwall pole close enough to the wall so the noodle foam is squeezed against the wall.Spend your savings on more tools."
4,Like 3rd and 4th hands,"This is my second set of foam rails. They really do work well, are simple to use and non marking. The best part is that you can set them up in the morning, take them down at night and set up again the next morning. No wasted plastic, no wasted tape, no tape residue or pealing paint on the ceiling."
2,Dissapointed.,"It looks like the product will do its job, but I am disappointed because I have other Zip Wall products and have a carry case for the poles.The rails do not fit into the carry bag.I would use the box they came it to store, but when you put the clips on to attach them to the pole the two will not fit into the box.Little clips do not look like they will stand up to being installed and removed over a period of time."
5,containment,the product is a very use full tool when doing construction containment systems. zipwall products are on all of my projects
3,Figurine for display,"I wouldn't consider this a toy for children or for playing with, but more for a Man Cave in which all sports memorabilia is displayed. The figure stands up well without falling off unless it is jarred from its shelf, so I wouldn't recommend households with kids place this on a lower shelf."
4,A very practical book,This is a very practical book. Which is wonderful if that's what you are looking for. There are other books with better theoretical discussions of what IPSec is. But few books are as helpful in getting IPSec to actually work in a Windows 2000 environment. I found it very helpful in setting up a few Windows 2000 VPN servers.
3,well written but slow,"This writer came highly recommended from a mystery-loving friend. It was well written but I found it a bit slow in pace. Had a soap opera feel as well. Perhaps I'm just used to reading more fast-paced American mystery-thrillers. I was entertained at times but I didn't find the characters realistic and I only found one person in the book who was likable. The ending was a let-down (and not a surprise) and not worth the slog. I'm giving this writer another chance - currently reading ""The Sculptress""."
3,Not Her Best Novel,"Having read The Sculptress and The Ice House, I looked forward to my next Walters book. I like the fact that she creates fresh characters with each story, rather than relying on a ""serial"" detective.Having said that, The Scold's Bridle was not the best example of Walters at work. The story was slow to develop, and the characters were not as well-drawn as they could have been. The red herrings were too obviously that, and almost everyone in the story comes out as unlikeable.I am usually a quick reader, but found myself slowed down by the side plots. Although the last few chapters were compelling reading, it did not make up for what went before.If you like Minette Walters, as I do, it is worth reading, but don't expect The Scold's Bridle to be her best novel."
2,"So-so mystery, I expected better","I expected a lot from this book, maybe my expectations were too high. One thing for sure is the motive for the killing is weak at best. Don't bother with this one."
3,Couldn't put it down...,"After seeing ""The Icehouse"" on PBS, I was intrigued by this mystery author and wondered if her other works were as complicated in plot. I was not disappointed by the twists and turns in ""The Scold's Bridle."" With each new chapter, more skeletons dive out of the closets of this small town. Is Matilda's death just one last spiteful act from an evil woman, or did someone finally decide that she deserved a deadly end with her scold's bridle atop her head? It is this question that keeps the pages turning until the end. The only drawback is that the answer to the mystery is a little too neat and tidy for the warped little village."
2,What could have been ...,"Elements of this book are terrific; a great setting; cast of characters and Minette's attention to detail. But unfortunately Minette chops and changes between protagonists leaving the reader with no character to root for and is prone to make her characters contradictory - they serve the plot line rather than act as you would, in truth, expect them to behave.The overall effect was disappointing; with such a clear story world there should have been more for the reader to enjoy."
5,One of the few books I recommend to others,"I read a lot on planes; US to Europe is a 3-booker. I had seen this reviewed but hadn't read it yet. Picked it up on the way back to the US. Couldn't put it down. One of the best mysteries I have read in ages. Made me go out and get all of hers. I found the characters solid, the plot twisty and the writing wonderful."
3,Disappointed,"I love a good mystery and after having read several favorable reviews of Minette Walters books esp. ""The Ice House"" I was very interested in reading one of her mysteries. I felt it began well but ran down to a disappointing end."
4,The Scold's Bridle Review,"All in all, I only gave this book a 4 because of the underdeveloped characters. I'll start with the bad stuff, then the good. The characters in my opinion were underdeveloped and undetailed. The ending, definitely unforseable, left you thinking, ""Huh? How'd that person jump from having 2 lines to being the murderer?"" Had it been less misleading towards just one or two characters, but more misleading towards all the characters, then I think the book of would been better. You would of never guessed the suspect cuz the suspect's barely mentioned in the book! Anyhow, the ending was nonetheless great with the developed characters, and the plot itself was excellent. Another page-turner! This is definitely a murder-mystery book!"
5,ALPINESTARS JACKET RAIN RJ-5,"Excellent, just follow the size chart from their web page , and it will fit perfectly..."
4,The Truth Will Come Out,"Helen McCloy's THE DEALY TRUTH takes place on Long Island in an isolated seaside villa. Dr. Basil Willing is renting a small shore shack for a vacation. He has been prodded several times to join the house parties given by his landlady, Claudia Bethune.Claudia wants to learn the truth of what her relatives and friends think of her. She steals a truth serum and holds a dinner party for her nearest and dearest. In the early morning hours, as he returns to his cottage Dr. Willing sees what he thinks is a fire and investigates. He finds Claudia near death at the table and hears footsteps fading up the stairs.Someone didn't want Claudia to learn the truth about them and Dr. Willing finds himself landed as a suspect in murder.A good read for those who love early detective stories.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
4,Nice Towel,This is a nice towel for the money. The shipping was a little slow. It took about two full weeks to receive and that was after I reminded them.
5,Great addition to Superman Bike,I ordered the Superman helmet to go with the Superman bike. What a great combination. A must have for the superman fanatic in your family! Helmet also comes with elbow pads and knee pads.
3,Eh,"Well, this book is okay. Because of the glowing reviews, I was excited to read ""Rachel's Choice."" The plot is very good with some interesting twists. However, I'm tired of reading romance novels where the man sweeps in and saves the day for the woman. I'm also tired of reading ""sex scenes"" that are along the lines of ""he took her again and again."" Be real. Plus the historical aspect isn't very realistic. I get tired of all Southerners in romance books not believing in slavery/not owning slaves, lets be real, if this Chance fellow (crative name) was a calvary officer, then he had to provide his own horse, meaning he owned property and, undoubtedly, slaves. This book has good imagry and discriptions of rural life, but it's not much of a historical romance novel, unless romance has suddenly come to mean sex that involves throbing hardness on the riverbank. Also, I found it to be slightly homophobic in one part."
3,About average,"Having read hundreds of romance novels, Galbadon to ones such as this, it becomes easier to rate them and harder to find a great one! Rachel's Choice is about average for writing style, character development and sensuality. The part of the plot that is hard to believe is the ending. A confederate from Virginia moving seamlessly into a Philadelphia law practice days after the end of the war is not believable--even with the advantage of great wealth--then going on to Congress!!"
4,No Problems,Fits the vac without any problems. Would recommend. Would purchase again when needing to replace the filter next time. a
3,hoover 40130050 allergen cartridge filter,"worked as it described,didn't fit very well but it ain't going on the airplane i'm flighting on so it's okay for the money and convenience,no big deal"
1,NOT AUTHENTIC,"I ordered a HOOVER filter. Although I received a filter, I received one that was generic, without Hoover manufacturer markings, not in a retail Hoover package. It was in a ziploc. Seriously? If I wanted a generic filter I would had saved a few dollars and ordered this one.Generic Hoover Foldaway and TurboPower HEPA Filter 3100Shame on you, @MoreQualityLessMoney, Shame on you."
3,Not exactly a fit...,"The part I received is not the same as the picture, but an off brand, so beware what people may be sending you. I ordered this product on Amazon after finding that all of the local stores like Target, Walmart, Shopko, etc no longer carried replacement filters for our vac. The filter seems to work okay, but it is not exactly the same quality or type of plastic as the previous genuine hoover filters I used in the past. It was difficult to get on the top mount, but went on with what seemed an excessive amount of force followed by a snapping sound that is usually associated with breaking plastic. Everything seemed solid and it works though, and I could find no cracks in the vacuum part."
1,Very dishonest - NOT sent filter in picture,"I have purchased these filters directly from Hoover before and was very satisfied. I was lured in because the price on Amazon was significantly lower. I read some of the poor reviews but somehow thought I would be the exception. Boy was I wrong. The filters sent are not in the genuine Hoover packaging as in the picture. Instead, they are cheap knock-offs. I will no longer trust Amazon as in my opinion this was outright fraud."
2,"Not sure if it's a Hoover filter, probably a generic","When I got my shipment the filters were not in protective packaging as seen in the advertisement. The filters were loose in the box, and when I looked at the filters there was nothing on them to denote they were Hoover allergen filters. Who knows what company produces these filters."
4,Evil Intentions,"This book was recommended by an acquaintance who grew up with the victim. It was difficult to read but provided a lens into the depraved world we live in and that we can never be too careful to protect ourselves and loved ones. The author was very respectful in approach of telling this story, as well as being objective."
3,Evil intentions,Good read. Author gave great background on all characters. I would recommend to anyone that loves to read true crimes
3,just ok,This book never really moves forward.It just keeps repeating over and over.I am a true crime fan and I can only say this book is just ok.
2,Old rules rugby.,This book is redundant due to the changes that have been made in the laws since its publication. Wouldn't bother with it.
3,Necessary for school,"This was an interesting book, but very dry. It was necessary for my class, but the customer service end of this product was very good."
4,science of fingerprints:classification and uses,good and interesting.i can get a lot of informa- tion about fingerprint.a lot of understanding and reading about the info. which is fingerprint.
2,A decent manual of fingerprinting technique,"A pretty good opportunity to learn about how the FBI handles the details of fingerprinting. For example, the book explains how the FBI recommends what police agencies should do when they arrest someone without fingers.However, the title is inaccurate. There is nothing scientific in the book. There is not a single footnote; there is no reference to any scientific work."
3,"Book we got with this ISBN lacks publisher, may be older edition","Our library ordered ""The Science of Fingerprints: classification and Uses"" by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, ISBN 9781619491366. Amazon indicates this title was published by Empire Books, in December 2011.However, the book we received lacks a publisher name, imprint page, date of publication, and seems to leave out all mention of 21st-century computer databases for tracking and filing fingerprints. (I found Chapter 8 in the 2002 edition dealt with computer databases, but the Chapter 8 in our received copy is titled ""How to Take Inked Fingerprints."")I believe this copy is NOT the one advertised and may be a public-domain reprint of an older edition, as some do seem to be available at Project Gutenberg.Amazon, it would be helpful if you listed contents, so we cataloging librarians could more easily determine if we've received the correct edition of a title.Thank you.Pat Dunn, Red Rocks Community College Library."
3,beginning fingerprinting class,"Bought this book for a beginning fingerprinting class, I believe I paid under 10$ for this. Good thing because the edition I received looks like it was thrown out of the window of someones car and landed in a ditch and was run over several times. It was a good book to study for tests."
4,Very Informative,"I'm an 18 year old interested in the field of forensics, so although this book might be a bore to anyone not into fingerprint analysis, I found it to be quite interesting. It may be very wordy at times and things might be explained a little roughly but I've gotten a lot out of this book. There are a lot of informative diagrams but sometimes you may get lost having to flip between pages to look at the diagrams being referenced the page before, or sometimes almost several pages before."
4,Nice watch,"I have been purchasing Pulsar watches for over 15 years and have yet to be disappointed. The referenced watch is great looking and keeps time very well. The only disappointment I have is the stiff stem. It is hard to get it into place to make changes to the time, day and date. Other than that I am pleased with the watch."
3,GUN FIGHT,"GUNFIGHT, a movie I was happy to add to my collection. A good film for 1961, believable story, good acting, James brown plays his part well, as does Gregg Palmer who plays the outlaw brother. I like the western genre and I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any other western fan."
2,Did Not arrive yet.,"Sadly I can not give a helpful review on this because it is now 9 days past the last day of the estimated arrival date and the book is still not here. When a package has a 16 day arrival window I anticipate it getting to the destination in that time period. I was wrong. I am sure I would like the book since it is for a class, but I am now considering withdrawing from that class due to not having the required materials."
4,Insightful Book,"""Aircraft Accident Analysis: Final Reports"" is an insightful book on aircraft accidents. I found the book fascinating and enlightening. The investigations into some past accidents were particularly illuminating in explaining why serious aircraft accidents and incidents happen and provide insights into how similar accidents can be prevented in future. The book provides accounts of some of the more well-known aircraft mishaps and dissects each one for causes and chains of events. It also provides the reader with some lessons on various human-factors, weather-related and other issues.This is a well-researched book which is useful and insightful reading for those with an interest in preventing or reducing aircraft incidents and accidents such as pilots, aviation safety professionals, regulators and aeronautical engineering students."
4,Arrived in time!,Item arrived in a timely manner. Item arrived in the condition that was stated. Overall generally pleased with the transaction and because it arrived so quickly I was able to use the item to catch up with the rest of the class who started the course a week ahead of me. Thanks!
1,Don't confuse it with the hardcover editions,"I'm really enjoying Gotham Central, but I wanted to warn purchasers that the paperpack volumes are differently numbered but largely duplicative of the new hardcover editions. For example, the two storylines in this paperback volume are the same two storylines included in Volume 2 of the Gotham Central hardcover edition. (The hardcover edition includes issues from before and in between those storylines that are omitted from the softcover editions.)The paperback editions will give you the big storylines, and the hardcover editions will give you every issue. Just be careful about purchasing both hardcover and paperback, because you'll end up with lots of duplication."
3,"An OK book, not great, but not bad","Ra's al Ghul has waged his war to find balance for the world over a very long time, and over that time he has made many enemies. Perhaps his deadliest enemy has been Batman, who through Wayne Enterprises has been denying him access to Lazarus Pits. However, Ra's has another enemy who wants him dead, his own daughter. The three camps are spinning their webs, and someone is going so suffer, but who?Overall, I found this to be an OK book. The history of Ra's al Ghul and his daughter was interesting, if slow moving. Bruce's meeting with his dead parents was ultimately unsatisfying and anticlimactic. The finale was pretty good, and kept the story from just petering out.So, yeah, it's an OK book, not great, but not bad. Eh."
4,Gritty Gotham tale shines!,"This is exactly how I see Gotham City in my mind. Grimey, gritty, dirty, whatever word you would like to use. They all apply. Rucka & Brubaker write two different stories each compelling and important and there are only a couple of scenes involving super heroes. The Joker story is creepy and the Mad Hatter tale is weird and smarmy, just like him. My only complaint is that the cast is so big that its hard to keep track of them at times."
4,Good and enjoyable story,I enjoyed reading it. The story brings a good contribution to Batman's Universe.
5,a review from my daughter,"""The book is good,The book is cool,The book is great,The book has poems in it,The book!""This is the review (a ""poem"" in her opinion) from my six-year-old daughter. She loves those Frog and Toad books. She reads them a lot."
4,5 yr old granddaughter really enjoys these books.,"Great little stories of the adventures of two friends, Frog and Toad. My only complaint is that even for paperbacks, they aren't very sturdy. If it weren't for the box they store in I'm sure they wouldn't last long at all."
4,Great Classic for Kids,"I grew up on these books and loved them as a kid. I had the opportunity to share one of the stories to someone during the summer. The 7 year old loved it so much, i had to purchase a set so that he could enjoy what i enjoyed growing up. The adventures of Frog and Toad are funny. It is also great when you are learning to read books independently."
3,"Haven't gotten past the cover,,,,","I've taken this set of books out a couple of times with my grandson, he's 5, but we never get past the cover,,, maybe when he's a little older but right now he doesn't have the interest to get into this set,,, we literally have 100's of books so he has many choices but this hasn't been one of them yet."
5,Very funny stories,These are very entertaining stories. I love reading them and my kids love hearing them. Good for starting to read also. My kids quote them.
3,"Simple, but entertaining for little ones","This book is good for the pre-reader. It is basically a picture book with the phrases ""No no Nicky"" repeated throughout the book, which is good since children like repetition. It is about a cat who gets into all kinds of trouble, for example, in the kitchen he knocks over some pots, etc., etc. My 3 year old loved this book for the longest time, mostly for the pictures I think. Basically it doesn't have a lot of substance but is nonetheless fun."
4,"No, No Nicky","All of my children adored this book. It's simple style and wording encouraged them to ""read"" the book. It was also valuable to teach them common dangers. Of course some reinforcement and explanation from mom and dad is required to get the full benefit."
1,give me a break!,"If the buyer has no idea of true Franciscan apple, then the product is fine. If you are looking for additional plates to add to your collection of ""true"" apple franciscan...then give me a break about ""hand-painted visible brush strokes"" exuding individuality."
2,"Don't buy the Jumbo pack again, honey!","One day my dad went to the pet store and got some dog food for our puppy, Cookie. The only thing wrong with the food is THERE WAS TOO MUCH! We have a small dog and we had to put all the dog food in large popcorn cans. (You know, the ones with chrismas designs?) It was still healthy, nutritious food, but if you have a small dog, DON'T BUY IT! Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""
3,Wiper blade lasted 3 months.,I put a set of these wiper blades on my daughters car. They only lasted 3 months before coming apart. The Arizona sun is hard on wiper blades but not that hard.Bob
2,Aluminum or plastic?????,"I was either shipped the wrong item or Amazon is showing the wrong picture and description. ""Aluminum heat dispersion"". This is not possible since the item I received was all plastic. The picture also shows an aluminum case with a black plastic front, not the cheaper all plastic case. The item they sent me was the MB449SK-B."
1,Just enough information to be near ly useless,"While not designed to be a reference tool, the book repeatedly offered just enough information to be nearly useless. To me the title ""Fast Track"" assumes its a ""quick start"" book for beginners. While I wouldn't expect it to teach you something as simple as an if statement, it assumes a higher level of programming knowledge than is common to newbies. If you have zero knolwedge of ASP.net don't start here.The index in the book is less than satisfying.Explanations of many items are weak and uninformative. If your apps don't fit their molds you will have to difficulty adapting your code.The only pros were the number of examples and the low price."
1,Only for the networking newbie,"Doesn't go in-depth enough for someone who already knows winsock. Doesn't even cover UDP and it's role in games. This is more of an intro book to game programming with multiplayer concepts. It briefly covers writing a socket class using TCP and then jumps into DirectPlay. No mention of how to handle error conditions like packet loss, client drops, etc."
2,Should be titled Windows Game Programming,"I am not saying the book is all bad, but it sure doesn't follow its title. What I don't understand is why the author fails to mention DirectX in the title, although there is a three-hundred-page-long chapter on that.On the other hand, the author seemed to believe that the word multiplayer will describe the book's contents well. I don't think that's very fair, because you won't find any solutions to real problems on multiplayer game development. When you are looking for such stuff in this book, you will find importnant chapters like Network Synchronization, covered on one complete page!All in all you might like the book if you want to learn some DirectX programming, but if you would like to learn language independent multiplayer game programming, there is not much this book can do for you."
3,Needs to be updated to 2nd edition!,"This book was interesting back in 2001, but today DirectPlay is deprecated, so 80% of this book is now no longer useful. That isn't saying much though: I doubt if any programming book written 8 years ago is still relevant! But still, it was an interesting read at the time and I would like to see a new edition covering Winsock2. There's like nothing in print on this subject today... I would like to find a book that covers hardcore Winsock2 and threading, and builds a rudimentary MMO concept game with a dedicated server that the reader can play around with, and use to build a few small persistent game projects."
1,What a load of mum-bo-jumbo,"Ok this is one of the worst investments I have made in my entire life! I thought 30% off - great, but this books is ridiculously had to follow - I'm doing a degree in computing and still I was stumped. I woul say don't waste your hard earned cash - you'd be better off throwing it down a drain! I feel that the DirectX parts were lacking important details and the multiplayer development chapters were also full of holes. My advice is save your money till a better title comes on the market!"
3,Waste of pages?,"I bought this book because it says that it will show you how to make a simple MMORPG. I starting reading on the server and client part of it and don't see anything that helps you make a MMORPG. Of course the source code has it all, but what good is that when you don't even understand what it means. On top of all this most of the book is not even related with what the title says. Lots of the pages were wasted by non-relating subjects. I do think its a good book and I'm glad I still bought it. I recommend this book."
1,Makes a better doorstop than info source!,"Talk about false advertising. The title of this book should be ""game programming for idiots."" I bought this book hoping to find some insight into multi-player game design with an emphasis on massively multi-player applications, and what I got was a phonebook sized stack of paper that does an excellent job of explaining the issues involved without actually giving any solutions! Let me sum up the knowledge contained within...When implementing a multiplayer game you can use a client-server or peer to peer architecture. Peer to peer results in more connections. And you might look into using sockets or DirectPlay, but you'll need to buy a different book to really understand what is going on...oh and with mmporpg applications you'll have to worry about zones and server boundaries, but how to solve those problems is left as a exercise for the reader!"
5,Great quality!,"Theses crimpers are built well. Feel very strong and smooth. They are 1 5/8"" blade which is nice! Not much to say, they are Kleins!"
4,relaxing,If you are looking for soothing relaxing music this CD is for you. There are no vocals and no drumming that will make you want to get up and move.
1,Incredible monotony,"I bought this album on the strength of reviews I'd read, without ever having heard a note of Coyote Oldman's music. Big mistake. This is the kind of ""ambient"" music where one sustained note makes up a whole track. I listened to it all the way through and asked myself, ""HUH? So where's the music?"" This album may be good noise to cure insomnia or to produce a meditative stupor, but I'm appalled that anyone considers it to be music. I guess anything that comes out of a musical instrument can be called ""music"" if you're seriously determined to find favor with the products of primitive cultures. Equal rights for the musically disabled? Do yourself a favor and listen to a Coyote Oldman album BEFORE you buy one."
2,As Many bpm as it Takes,"You may like this album by Michel de Hey if you are into hard and speedy techno. Personally I think the compilation features uninteresting tracks, flows terribly, and the mixing is poor.2/5 stars"
4,Enjoyed. AUTHOR is GAYLE WILSON not Jim Wilson,"Wrong author name on Amazon.com webpage. For this ISBN, titleand Harlequin Intrigue #541 romance, the author of thisbook is GAYLE WILSON and not JIM Wilson as shown."
3,comfortable but not durable,"I purchased two of these mule shoes and alternated wearing each of them for the summer. They were comfortable. However, the bottom sole easily adheres to pebbles and causes holes and breakage. I would recommend only wearing the shoes indoors."
3,It Was A Good Book,"I thought that the book, ""Raymond's Run"" was an okay book. It gave good detail of the characters and the way they thought about different things. It told how Raymond knew that she was going to win the race because she was the fasest person in their town and she won the race every year. I would recommend that if you like books about sports or anything related to it, then you should read this book."
4,respect for all,"I liked this book because Ms. Bambara shows us it is important to have respect for everyone, especially those who are mentally challenged. The main character, Squeaky, shows respect for her brother who faces challenges due to his handicap."
3,Raymond's Run,I think Raymond's Run is a epic book.I really liked the story and it's plot. I also liked the characters and their personalities. This would be a great book for someone who was into heart touching novels.
5,This book is wonderful for any age!,I personally think the main character is a fine example of a well-mannered individual with exception of age. This gives you a great outlook on life after you read it.
4,Derek's review,This book is an extremely inspirational one. I can totally understand how squeaky would want to protect her brother Raymond from bullys like Gretchen. i think it's also very cool how squeaky thinks she can teach Raymond to run with that odd style of his.!!!!!!!!
3,The Raymonds Review,I think Raymonds run was a really enterresting story. It was completly diffrent from what I thought it was going to be. But it was really good. I think it was sad and mean how everybody would pick on Raymond. I think it was really nice and resonsable of sqeaky to take care of her brother. I agree with sqeaky on alot of things. But when it comes to racing she kindof gets the big head. All in all this was a good book.
3,Richards book review,I thought this was a o.k book. I liked the that Raymonds sister really took care of him. I think she i s avery good sister. I'm very proud or the way she stoped running to coach him to runing track. I think Raymond would be a great runner.
3,"Flaw in ""O""","Hey Gang,This cap is inexpensive becuae the ""o"" in Coast Guard does't close. It still looks spiffy reguadles of the flaw."
5,john plays perfect without facial expressions,John Williams is original because he doesn't play for the late Segovia. Instead he plays for the composer of the piece. The second half of the video portrays Williams as a yuppie sheltered from society. More playing could have prevented that impression. The video contains a great variety of pieces ranging from Japan to Cordoba Spain. One must understand that his flawless playing is from countless hours of practice. Yngwie Malmsteen and John share one trait-the denial of dedication and lengthy practice sessions.
5,Guitarists BEWARE ! ! !,"This Video is not for the Guitarist wanna-be. Be warned, if you watch this video, you may never feel worthy to pick up a guitar again. He's a Master and we can't even touch his tuning pegs. The best collection of vurtuosity I have ever seen."
5,For the Franciscan Apple Collector,"This little Franciscan Apple Dinnerware Creamer is so beautifully made. There is a matching sugar bowl and lid, too. I do not use mine to hold cream or half-and-half on an everyday basis because I would have to keep it covered with saran wrap so the liquid would not absorb any refrigerator odors. However, I do love to use it when I use my Franciscan Apple Coffepot or when entertaining at a dinner party. There is also a small milk jug, and there are two other larger pitchers in the Apple pattern. I have also used the Apple creamer as a server for sauces."
1,No bad taste at all... What a waste.,"My previous brand of no bite polish was discontinued, so I decided to give this one a try. It was a total waste as you can't taste the polish unless you scrape it off with your teeth. Even then, it might as well just be regular nail polish. It doesn't taste bad enough. It was inexpensive for a reason."
1,Didn't work,"The only reason I gave this 1 star is so it wouldn't like I forgot to rate it. Didn't work, my 3 year old had her fingers back in her mouth as soon as it dried, I reapplied, same thing...."
1,All kids still biting nails,I put this on all the kids and muyself (to test the flavor). None of us could taste anything.
1,Doesn't Work!,I have been a nail biter for as long as I can remember (I'm 25) and decided to give this a try. It has absolutely no bitter taste. I'm going to try the Mavala product...the reviews are way better for that.
3,Product is so-so,"bought this for my 7 yr old daughter...unfortunately, it doesn't stop her from biting... so will have to try something else."
1,DOESN'T WORK!,"I bought this product for my son who sucks his thumb. I tested it on myself and him and it doesn't work! The bad taste that is supposed to keep you from biting your nails or sucking your thumb is barely there and completely goes away after a couple seconds. When I went to return this item because it doesn't work, I was told I couldn't return it since I opened it. How was I supposed to know that it was made so poorly? It's a product you would have to try to find out! Don't waste your money!!!"
2,It works for about 20 minutes,"The product worked for us for about 20 minutes. After that, the bitter taste went away and my 5 years old daughter returned to biting her nails without anything stopping her. I bought the Mavala product and we were able to get rid of the habit. It worked for the period I applied the product. I did this once every two days for a month or more. Since I stopped, she started biting her nails again. She says she just forgets about it. We must try it again."
1,This doesn't work at all to my two years old son,"This doesn't work at all to my two years old son.Even after using this, my son still sucks his fingers as usual."
4,Don't bite your nails.,"It does smell bad but it seems to be working, I just need to remember to apply it to the nails."
1,Doesn't work,"My 3 year old sucks her thumb and when I applied this product to her thumbnail, it was as if she didn't notice and kept right as sucking her thumb after the product dried.I'm going to give Mavela Stop a try. The ratings are much higher on that product."
5,thumbs up,the product came much faster than expected and works like a charm. it tastes disgustingly bitter and im hoping it keeps working even after its not being used
4,Not everyone can taste it,"I never write reviews for products, but I just want to warn some people. I bought this product to help me learn not to put my fingers near my mouth. Unfortunately, it appears that not everyone can taste the bitter chemical! I normally have gel or shellac manicures, and I tried this product over the shellac. The product went on as directed, but I can not taste a thing. Just to make sure I hadn't bought a dud bottle, I had someone lick one of my fingers, which prompted an immediate repulsion that I was hoping I would experience as well! So, I have given the product 4 stars because I do have faith that it works, but unfortunately, I am a person who can not taste this bitter chemical."
3,"It works well, but leaves nails shiny","I am trying to stop biting my nails, so I bought this product to help deter myself. Unfortunately the product makes your nails shiny, which tends to draw even more attention to your nails. Plus I am a man that doesn't want to appear to have painted nails... call me old fashioned.In any case, the product works, but I am going to try to find a product the works AND is a bit more discrete."
4,What nightmares are made of!,"I received this CD from a co-worker when I was in the hospital. He knew I loved ambient music so I was very excited! Upon arriving home, I popped it in the player and sat back to enjoy. Wow! This actually made the hair on the back of my neck stand up! It's a chilling fluid movement that can be found in the depths of our nightmares. I highly recommend this if you are up for a evening of chills and wanderings of the imagination."
5,Enchanting!,"Only two words; OWN IT. A must have for any dark ambient fan, a true piece of art, will take you to higher dimensions of music. Even if you are not familiar with Dark Ambient style of music, this is for true music fans. [but definitely not for commercial or mainstream music listeners]from CD back cover - A guide to possible interpretations of ambivalent reality..."
2,Didn't do it for me,"I bought this disc on the strength of the reviews, but only liked 1 or 2 of the pieces (I think #3 or 4). I'm a big fan of dark ambient music but the sound effects just annoyed me to no end on this one. It seemed to me to be pretty repetitious as well. I much prefer Strata and Soma to this one."
3,Not as good as expected....,"These two artists are among the best in atmospheric music...I expected this to be a classic, but it isn't. It is very good, but individually these artists are better than together. I guess some marriages are not made in heaven.. This album tends to become boring and slow at too many points...lack of direction may be a better view"
2,Not worth buying,"All they tell you is the basic's of the game like position, blinds, hands like a flush or a pair and they get into some tells but they don't really get into the strategy of the game like knowing when to bluff or reading hands. If you really need to know whats in this dvd your better off asking someone. It was way to basic for me."
5,Fantastic picture--even with regular coax cable.,"This is a great buy. If you are looking for a bedroom TV or a really nice kitchen tv, or even for LAN parties...(it has a cool handle) this is the TV. IT is $200 cheaper then at Best Buy. HDMI and component video inputs...and doubles as a PC monitor. I know TV's.--I have 6 of them :)"
4,Good looking TV - limited remote,"Good looking TV, good picture, easy to mount. Too bad the remote is not a universal style. It will not control the cable box or dvd, so I am using the cable box remote. I did have some initial trouble getting some of the HD channels to work when using an hdmi cable, but I am not sure if that was more of a problem with the cable box. Anyway the problem sorted itself out and is now working fine."
4,Boot Review,"I am very please with the boots. I initally saw them in a magazine and just had to have them. The picture looks exactly like the item I recieved. I have been diappointed many times in the past with the actual item once I received it. This was not the case here! They are stylish and quite comforatable. I normally wear a size 6 1/2 but because the last pair available was a size 6, I took a chance a got them. They feel great and don't even need to be ""broken in""!! My only small disappointment is that I don't believe the boots are leather. Dispite that, I would purchase them again and am now interested in trying more items by Akademiks. To top it off, they were on sale."
4,george jones soft back book,i read the hard back book and it's not quite like the soft cover.i like the hard cover best. i know they said new material for the soft cover.which is the correct version. do that mean george jones remembered more for the soft cover. thank you for asking
3,Too Much about Too Little,"I actually read through all 430 pages wondering how it ends up for him, hoping he finds some meaning to life. The end reveals little the other 429 pages didn't, which makes for a rather shallow autobiography of this country legend. Another talented life wasted on drugs and drunkenness and self-centeredness. It seems he never did find anything outside of himself; even in the wife he believes saved him, it's all about him, never the wife or stepdaughter he abused and failed to love. I'll continue to be a fan of his music, and hope before he dies he finds something more important than himself. Then, I'll be a fan of George Jones."
4,George Jones was a lovable rascal !!!,"I found the book to be very enjoyable, even laughed out loud more than once. Yes, he was a rascal, but you have to like him anyway.The stories he tells are entertaining."
3,Good Reference Guide,"This book does provide students, who have taken a first course in differential equations, a good look at Fourier Analysis, Boundary Value Problems, and partial differential equations; however, you might wish to obtain a working knowledge of linear algebra before using this book for the before-mentioned reasons - the chapters dealing with linear algebra (six and seven) are awesome for review, but horrible for the beginning student.Other than that, the book is a good resource when it comes to the review chapters on ordinary differential equations, multivariable calculus, probability, etc...This is a recommended book for the engineer who likes to review math on those boring summer days..."
2,Look before you buy,If you want something to check your work against the student solution maunual isn't it. Look it over before you spend $37 on it. It does contain a FEW answers for each chapter and hints for each section in the chapter. Encourage the college library to attain a few copies if they use the main text but save your own money.
2,Not thorough.,"The manual only covers about every fifth problem in each section, and not very well at that! Better off trying to learn it from the book or from the professor."
4,Gitzo 2540 mono pod,This 2540 is a very nice mono pod. Very light and very fast operation. This mono pod works wonderfully in the field! It is very well made! Will do great for most people. I needed a little more stability under my gear. I stepped up to the 5540. This was more stable for me as I use very heavy and large glass.
3,guilty pleasure,"This show is really funny, not because it is a brilliant comedy. It is done so bad you will be sitting there like wtf. Dex the prince of edonoi looks like a small mouth bass yet is portrayed as cute. the pet furbus is something that needs animal controll to come along and put to sleep. I would say this show is good for the mistie crowd that enjoys makeing fun of bad things, or it could make a good drinking game. Just take three shots when furbus calls for dex."
4,A good Alger Novel,"This one of Alger's better novels. Frank Courtney is defrauded of his inheritance by his stepfather. He goes to the city to earn a living and fortunately makes a wealthy friend. This friend sends him on a trip to investigate some property for him. Does Frank succeed? Of course he does, this is Hortio Alger, but it is a fun read. Alger's books are uplifiting and show that by hard work a person can get ahead."
4,awesome product but the packaging sucked.,I will never go back to using standard cotton towels for cleaning. These babies pick up everything. I used them to wipe down my bathroom and polish off granite countertops without the use of chemicals. The only thing I didn't care for was they arrived taped together instead of a bag as pictured. Thus I had to wash all of them first to remove the tape residue. Aside from that minor inconvenience this has helped green up my cleaning routine.
4,Soooo easy,"I love these cloths. They're a good size & clean so much better than paper towels, rags, sponges, etc. They even work dry. with no ckeaning products, on many items. I put one in the car too."
5,Many uses,How did I ever clean house without these! I use them on everything inside as well as outside and the car. They have an interesting texture that seems to grab dirt and water. I even use them to clean our bathroom mirrors to a shine. I've only had these a couple months and I've tried them on many surfaces. They are my go to for any household cleaning. I highly recommend them.
4,Very Useful Little Towels,"These towels are great for many things: washing windows, washing your car, dusting, etc. These towels hold up well and collect a lot of the dirt that is on many different surfaces.The towels will turn a noticeable black after cleaning with them for a while; however, just throw them in the washing machine and they turn back to that nice yellow that they were when you first got them. You can dry them in the dryer just make sure it is a low heat and do not use any fabric softener.I would recommend them for everyone who is doing any form of cleaning since they hold up well and work well. My only complaint is that I wish they were thicker, but this is not a big complaint since they supply you with 12 at about $13 (~$1 each plus tax). Purchase these, you will not regret it!"
4,EXCELLENT,When I bought this product I thought in a small towel but the size for this is BIG... great and economic price!
2,No happy,"I have not used these yet. They came in a black bag. They look like they have been repackaged. I wanted what was shown. I do not know that I got what I ordered. They are labeled detailers preference. The product shown is clean-rite. I ordered these before and got the clean-rite product in a clean-rite bag. So, do not order these unless you want a different product then is shown."
1,Sans Brackets,"Unit did not come with mounting brackets as shown in the product photo. Good luck finding some brackets with exactly the right spacing for the screws on top which allows the unit to fit tight against the side of the AC unit. Heavy, probably best for floor use."
4,Exponential Growth Indeed,I have read Don Mitchell's 2000% Workbook and I found it very practical and user friendly. In this book Don becomes your coach along the way to exponential growth. I read it after the 2000% Solution book and it vastly improved my ability to conceptualise ways of improving my dental practice. I fully recommend the book to any enterprising entrepeneur. It will walk you through the process in an exciting way. One of my major frustrations with authors is that they are too theoretical but I find Don Mitchell in this workbook refreshingly practical. I walked out of reading the book straight into applying the concepts. My business has never been the same. Thank you Dr Mitchell for showing us the way.
2,Narration detracts from music,"I bought this CD out of curiosity, to see how they handled the intermixing of narration and music. I was disappointed by the fact that the narrator talks through the music peices, in some cases throughout the whole song. In order for her voice to be heard, the music gets turned down low and ends up taking a back seat to the narration. While this also satisfied my curiosity about ""What part of the story does this music piece go to?"" I have listened to this CD only once and don't really plan on listening to it again. I prefer the non-narrated version so much more than this."
5,Great,"The first time I heard this CD I was imidiatly captured by the sweet meangiling of naration and beautiful song. I sat, eyes shut tight, for the entire CD. The vivid imagery of the story mixes wonderfully with the gorgeous melodies. I recomend this CD to anyone who loves music as well as anyone who loves a beautifuly told story."
2,"A hassle, that what it is.","...Or a hustle- your choice. I read reviews on some tech sites that praised this product, so while I was buying a new laptop I also decided to switch DAWs. I have the compatible hardware, but the program is still a pain to use. Not intuitive, and not at all more impressive than Sonar or Cubase. Additionally, it only uses RTAS plug-ins, and while Synthogy Irovy says it installed the RTAS plug-in, M-Powered can't find it. Being that is the plug-in I use for everything, it kinda makes M-Powered useless for anything but recording guitar and voice.If you use a lot of MIDI like I do, avoid this."
4,Great for quick car cleanup,You can remove car dust in just a couple of minutes with this duster. Would not recommend for cleaning cars that are very dirty or have mud or bugs on exterior. But it's a great product for its purpose- removing dust.
4,color,"Good quality, good package, Original Part, but the color of this product is not the same as the original part.This is not cromed."
3,get a more recent book,"Henkel gives a quick guide to various common probablistic tests used by sociologists. The book is mostly directed towards undergraduate students, who might desire a precis of the subject.He goes through elementary probability theory. Rolling of dice. What randomness means. The Gaussian [bell] curve of the normal distribution. Chi-square distribution. F distribution. Plus, very importantly, how to test hypotheses with some rigour, given these tools.While the maths is certainly still as true now as in 1976 when Henkel wrote the book, you may want to consult a more recent and more comprehensive text. The graphics in his book are rather limited. I used texts like that as a student, and they don't bother me. But current students are probably more used to texts using far more elaborate figures. In part this reflects cheaper printing costs. But also overall, it has probably yielded statistics books that are easier to understand."
1,Lousy Service!,"They tossed this item into a huge box, with no packing materials. Natrurally, it arrived in pieces.I tried to return it for a refund, but I get tossed into an endless loop."
3,Cracks Easily,"This is a great idea, but I bought two, one came cracked and the other one has cracked since I've had it."
4,Great cake keeper/carrier,This is a great cake keeper/carrier! I would definitely buy another one ... would give it 5 stars except it scratches fairly easily.
2,Not the quality I was expecting,From the picture of this cake keeper I was expecting a better quality product. I do not care for the way it locks. I feel that it is made cheaply. I also had mine arrive with the rub marks and scratches from the shipping. I do not recommend this if you are picky as I am.
1,Does NOT seal tightly at all,This is not a cake keeper because it doesn't seal tightly at all. It should be called a cake caddy. There is an important different between the two. I intend to return it.
3,It's A Struggle,"It's a struggle to carry this cake keeper. The handle is a plastic mound with no cut-out for fingers. It is hard to grasp and carry, especially if you are holding something else in your other hand. It is a struggle to open this carrier. It has 2 slots, one on each side, which allow a rounded edge to fit in the slot and slide to lock. However, in my case, it was hard to lock and once locked, it was even harder to open. On the positive side, the carrier is roomy and fits the Anniversary Bundt cake perfectly, without crowding. The bottom of the carrier is sturdy. You can use the bottom as a serving plate. I liked the idea of a carrier specifically for a bundt cake but this one just didn't work for me. If you are able to get it open and closed and don't have to carry it, it does works great as a cake keeper."
5,Great item at great price!,I really am pleased with this economical cake keeper. Keep in mind that it will definitely hold things other than Bundt cakes! It is sturdy and washes up well by hand. I am especially fond of the locking feature! I would be very pleased if this came in other colors.
2,Bundt cake keeper a bit fragile,"I also had problems with this cake keeper. I work in a school and carry cakes to the faculty frequently. The problem started with a crack in the base, which I solved with some tape. One day I walked in the teacher's lounge and the cover was in 2 pieces (obviously dropped). Not what one would expect for around $20.00."
2,Too easy to crack,Looks pretty but this cake keeper is essentially a bad concept. It's made to be carried around and at the same time breaks as easily as fine china. It's like if someone made a briefcase out of pure glass.
2,Not really worth it at all...,"First order arrived cracked and broken. As Amazon always does: they provided a quick replacement.Well, this replacement lasted all of two cakes. It split on the base and cracked. It now resides in the local landfill."
2,Looks great but cracks too easily,"Like several other reviews, mine cracked for the second cake I stored in it. Sounds like that is the norm for this product rather than an exception. Unfortunately, I haven't found another product as attractive in a durable plastic."
1,Don't buy this...,"Like everyone else, apparently, my plate cracked after the first time I used it. It was never dropped or temperature shocked. Its really a shame because it is attractive, and would be really handy if it wasn't such garbage. You'd think something made by Nordic Ware would be better quality."
5,Perfect Cake Keeper,"In reading all the other reviews, I must say mine has had no problems. It arrived in one piece. I've made cakes multiple times (sometimes in the space of days rather than weeks), it has fallen to the floor (accidentally - thank goodness it was not holding any cake) and not cracked. Aesthetically, it is a nice looking piece. Mind you, I never put the cake directly on the plastice. I use wax paper on the bottom (it's easy to cut to measurement since it has that nice ridge - hold down the wax paper, draw a circle, cut), so I don't know if that makes a difference. I use the paper to help keep cleanup to a minimum. And, I never put the cake keeper in the dishwasher."
1,Cracked first time I used this item,I normally don't write reviews but this item is flimsy. The top cracked the first time I used it. Not happy and will not be buying anything plastic from Nordic Ware again.
2,Cracks easily.,"I love the way this looks on the counter when guests are over. However, storing this is a bit tricky, and takes up a lot of space. I tend to put other things inside of it when storing (round cake pans, or spring forms) just to conserve space. In doing so, over the years the lid has cracked in several places. If you have a lot of storage space, and can set this aside on its own, then by all means it will be worth it. I, however, need a cake keeper that is less likely to crack."
2,Thin Plastic: Arrived Cracked,"I ignored the reviews about the fragility of this product but should have paid attention. It is very pretty and lightweight which I like, but it arrived with a crack that goes from the top to the bottom. It was wrapped in bubble plastic (lots of it) and packed with lots of bubbles (don't know the name for those plastic bags with air inside). The only thing about the packaging that could possibly have caused the problem was that my bundt pan was also in the same box but it was also very much wrapped up. I think that even if it had come intact, it probably would have cracked soon in normal use. Too bad, because it is pretty and a perfect size. The only other thing is that the handle is not designed for carrying which I thought would be the case from the picture. That's more my not looking carefully enough I suspect, mixed with more than a dollop of wishful thinking."
4,"Same as Williams Sonoma, but CHEAPER!","This is the very same item that's sold at Williams Sonoma, but at a much better price. I thought it was CLEAR from the image on the computer, but it actually appears more smoky gray, I wish it were actually CLEAR, but I had bought this along with a bundt pan as a gift for my new daughter-in-law. I'm sure she will get much use out of it!"
1,Terrible Cake Keeper,I bought this item a while ago. It was only used a couple of times and the base started cracking before becoming 100% useless. I threw it away. Pass this one by.
3,It's o.k.,"I'm some like it.cause it's strong, beauty and weigh light.I am so satisfied.plus!! It's very fast shiped."
5,Nordic Ware Deluxe bundt cake keeper,"I love this cake keeper, it looks great and is easily carried everywhere and would recommend it for anyone who loves to bake bundt cakes"
4,Finally.,"I've looked and looked for one of these. Finally found one. Would be perfect, but it is a little difficult to open and shut."
3,Great concept; flawed implementation,"This is an excellent design for attractively transporting bundt cakes. However, the plastic base has been accumulating tiny cracks every time I place even a barely warm cake on it. And yes, you have to be cery careful in general when handling (not exactly what you want from a plastic piece). When science catches up with aesthetics, we'll have a winner!"
3,SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES,"I have granite counter tops and when I placed a barely warm cake on the bottom part of this keeper, the bottom proceeded to slowly crack from one side to the other. I also took this to work during winter, about 45 degrees, and thus another crack developed. It is still usable, but I worry that it will completely sever. The keeper looks great, but the plastic is thin and apparently is not that durable."
2,"Great idea, cracks easily","My brother accidentally dropped the cake keeper on the floor after washing, and CRACK! all the way from the handle up to the top of the keeper. I only owned it 3 days before it was broken. It was diappointing because it seemed like such a great way to store my cakes!"
3,"looks beautiful, but not very durable","I ordered this one and the one for a 9x12 rectangle cake. They are both beautiful and look wonderful on a buffet. My problem is that as they are used, they scratch very easily. Even using a soft silicone server piece, at the end of the party there were numerous scratches on the bottom plates. I always cool my cakes completely, so have had none of the cracking problem, but the scratches make them very ugly for serving things on. I also only wash by hand. I was very disappointed in the wearability."
3,Hustler Soundtrack (NOT),"While this is funky and jazzy, it is not the soundtrack to the movie ""The Hustler"", which is what I was actually looking for. It is posted as the soundtrack, but is really just a CD with the same name."
3,"Nice knives, no display box!",These are a very nice set of knives. They are beautiful in appearance and have an excellent cutting edge.But don't be mislead as I was - the display box shown in the picture does not come with the set of knives! This misleading photo is why I dropped the knives from a 5 star to a 3 star.
4,it could have been a five star DVD...,"As I had said in other reviews, when Shemp isn't in the film, watch Larry. Although the films on this DVD are some of the best from the Curly period, I would have liked one or two Shemp shorts included. Now, if they would only wise up and release their two great war-time shorts (You Nazty Spy, I'll Never Heil Again) and start putting out (just to have a complete overview) the Joe Besser shorts. But, if you're a fan of Curly Howard, I highly recommend this DVD. Truly timeless comedy from the funniest men who ever lived."
5,"Much more than a soothing ""New Age"" CD","Many reviewers have noted the soothing and calming effects of the beautiful choral and instrumental work on this release, but I consider it much more than that: the oboe and clarinet melodies on ""Piping Down the Valley Wild"" and other tracks are very reminiscent of the beautiful classical works of post-impressionists composers like Poulenc, Roussel, and Milhaud. This is far more than a soothing ""New Age"" album; it's an excellent example of contemporary music that draws from the masters of the late 19th and 20th centuries. Bill Douglass' skill with melodic composition and execution is indeed impressive"
5,Very nice album,"This is a very beautiful, relaxing CD. I often listen to it while driving during rush hour to keep me calm."
5,One of the Best,"A friend loaned this CD to me a couple of years ago and it quickly became one of my all-time favorite CD's for relaxation. It's one that I highly recommend or would buy as a gift for someone under stress. It truly helps you achieve ""Deep Peace""."
5,Music Suis Generis,"There you are, like Freya Stark, trudging about the pitiless Hadhramaut wasteland of music. Eyes narrowing to the artistic label sandstorm blowing out the wadis of musical promotions, your quest for the Lost City of Music sui generis could be sandbagged. Finding the lost city and its inhabitants, however, you will prove Phillippe de Vitry's 14th century treatise on Ars nova is real and lives on still. That is, poetry makes music and not music poetry."
3,Not classical,"The Amazon reviewer seems to think this is ""modern classical"" music, which only proves how much the term ""classical"" has been cheapened. This CD is full of pretty, easy-listening tunes, none of which have a thing to do with classical music. Spa music personified, but anyone expecting a more serious level of music will be disappointed. Very well produced and recorded though."
4,A nice short Verismo opera,"This production goes to show that if you produce a not so famous and probably not the greatest opera in the world, the result can still be inspiring, delightful and very enjoyable. Marcella is a short opera. It seems more than a depiction of three situations: Found, Loved and Abandoned, than an elaborate plot. In fact many books, plots movies and operas can be also summarized with those three words. The music is melodic and easy to follow; the singers are very good in their singing and acting. The stage is minimal (low budget I assume), but the result is effective and conveys the opera to the audience with ease.My kudos to the Festival that decided to stage this seldom produced opera. I strongly recommend this DVD to those opera lovers who would like to see and listen to a very enjoyable Verismo opera."
2,aerobic products,does aerobic bulk cleanse make you loose or gain weight? and does it make you go to the bathroom easily? can you take this product if you are taking mag07 pills at the same time?
2,A refreshing new look at the Holy Communion Ordinance.,"Having attended church faithfully all of my life and participated in the Communion services as offered, it was a mind-awakening process of the true meaning of this Holy Ordinance after reading these devotions and hearing them presented in our local assembly. These devotions should be part of every born-again believer's library."
2,Same old drum and chant,"2 1/2For pseudo-authentic native American flavor, this redundantly refined new age offering can be less embarrassingly contrived than others like it."
2,A nice journey into atomispheric native american,This work with 2 great artists just didn't come out very well and I am glad they didn't try to do any further themes of this nature
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"I just read three negative reviews from customers that are all having the same problem I had. The product works great for 3 months and then does not work at all. When I put in a DVD the screen says ""Loading"" and then ""No DIsc"". Apparently this product only works for a few months, so I am assuming the great reviews are from very recent customers. I called Magnavox Customer Service and they were no help at all - they told ne to get a DVD laser lens cleaner, which I did - but the cleaner is a disc, so when I put in on of course I got the same message - ""No Disc"". I gave 1 star because there is no option for no stars."
1,Customer Service,I completely agree with the customer who said they received poor customer service. I had almost the exact same situation happen to me and I am still waiting to get my refund for the extra battery I did not receive in time for my trip. I love the dvd player but Magnavox/Phillips needs to rethink their Customer Service Call Center employees. It is a shame that every person I spoke to was giving me different information. Please try to train your employees on all the same information.
4,It's not so bad.,"I received this product for Christmas at least 2 years ago, and it does not have any major problems. It has always been a reliable product. I do not use it as my primary DVD device now b/c I got a laptop w/ a DVD writer ("
2,Battery life is to short,This is a great DVD player when you have it hooked up to a power outlet. But I have yet to get through a whole movie on just the battery. The longest time I've gotten yet is 1h 20m.
1,Poor Customer Service,"As mentioned in an earlier review, one can order an extra battery from Magnavox. However, getting through to a live person proved frustrating for me. I needed the battery for a long trip, and was told I would receive the battery (if I paid extra) in time. To make a long story short, it did not arrive on time, and I no longer had a use for it. After being on hold, being disconnected twice, and making several phone calls, I was told that I could return it at my cost, and pay a 15% restocking fee. This was despite the fact that 3 people had guaranteed I would receive the battery on time. No reason or apology was given to me for why I did not receive it on time, and Magnavox has lost a good customer due to this treatment."
1,Have not received this book!,I am not happy about this!This product was ordered Dec. 21 and has not been deleivered as of January 12!
4,Review from Me......,"I haven't read Howell before, but have been a fan of Sands vamp novels. I was surprised that of the two stories, Howells was much more enjoyable. The interaction between the two main characters was wonderful, and well written intrigue combined to make an extremely enjoyable read. Sands story, still enjoyable, just didn't measure up. For that reason I only give it 4 stars, but I am looking forward to Howells next installation in Highland Vampire."
4,loved it,"Would have given it 5stars but I think I have read too many Hannah Howell books starting to all seem the same but still, I loved it"
4,Entertaining!,"I was uncertain when I purchased the book as to what, exactly, it's format was. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that it consisted of two intertwined stories by two different authors. I'm a big Hannah Howell fan, but I'd never read anything by Lynsay Sands. I was impressed by how well the two authors pulled it off. Though their styles are different, the stories mesh well. The personalities of the protagonists are also quite different, as is the way each couple is introduced to each other. The secondary characters in each story are also well developed and either quite appealing or they make very excellent, if stereotypical, villains. Easy to read in one sitting."
5,According to my friend,MY friend (no really...) is very interested in eating disorders in a bizarre and obsessive way. She nows a LOT about them. According to her this boo is really great. Supposedly very accurate especially for the date it was written.
4,Good read,"The synopsis of this book might make it sound like it's centered on anorexia. Don't get me wrong, that disorder is a big part of this book, but there's much more to Willa than her anorexia. This story starts before she develops the eating disorder, and it's a very good book, especially in the light of what time this book was written.It was the early eighties (but this story is actually set in the seventies - New Years 1975 is mentioned) AIDS hadn't exploded into the news yet. Teen pregnancy was still (for the most part) all hush hush. The Regan years (so far) were good. Eating disorders weren't generally known about. So I cannot help but wonder what made the author write this book. Not that I'm complaining, of course. I discovered this book quite by accident in my high school library, and it was very good. I wasn't disappointed, and actually enjoyed the dated feeling of it (vintage novels are fun to read) If you want a book about anorexia that is different, check this out."
5,Memories,"I love this set. My grandmother had received this for a wedding gift in the 40's. I grew up eating dinner off these plates. When she passed I was given the set. I have 7 plates and 5 salad plates, and 4 tea cups and saucers. Plus the tea pot, butter dish, plater and serving bowls. I have since purchased a few extra pieces and I am slowly buying more to complete the original set. The only thing different between the set that is from the 40s and todays set is that the color is a little more lighter. When I finally settle down in one spot I plan on using it as my everyday dinnerware just as my grandmother did. Like I said the dinnerware was given to my grandmother in the 40's and she used it everyday for ~ 67 years and now I have it and it has moved with me. They are durable and will last you a long time."
4,Very Informative book...A must get for students,I read this book for my mobile engineering course for graduate course...it is very informative.
3,"Good for radio theory, not for understanding mobile tech.","The first 440 pages are concerned with the theory behind radio transmission, radio link calculation, propagation models, modulation techniques and Multiple Access Technologies (FDMA, TDMA, FHMA, CDMA, etc.) . Although all this theory is explained in many books, this book could be a convenient source for most you have to know about radio (layer-1). However, this book is very poor regarding the mobile standards (just one chapter), that was the info I was looking for. For understanding the upper layers in the mobile architectures, look for a more recent book, specific to your technology (GSM, D-AMPS, IS-95, etc)"
1,TERRIBLE BOOK!!!!,The book is absolutely terrible...for one thing there is TOO MUCH unnecessary math and the problems at the end of the chapter were too challenging compared to the example problems within the chapter(and to make it worse there are no answers..so how can you actually learn!!). The material is presented in pieces which made learning extremely difficult...definitely one of the worst text books I've ever had and I don't recommend it to anyone. It should never be used for an undergraduate class again!!!
3,This CD is a departure from the expected Raphael style,"I was captured by the the incomparable beauty of ""Raphael's Music to Disappear In"", I and II. The music lifted your spirits and transported you to mystical realm where you could experience your dreams. No other music has had quite this effect on me. ""Angles of the Deep"" was an excellent CD but did not have the quite the effect as his previous two albums. ""Intimacy: Music for Love by Raphael"" left me dissappointed, because it was not of the style that I had come to expect from Raphael. The music is interesting, but it now sounds similar to other New Age music. I hope, Raphael's next album will show a return to the style that has made his music unique."
3,cummings ms reading class,Well I thought the book was OK But I have doughts about the book.I really thought it was a kind of a drama mixed with a little bit of a action but I would read another on my honor book but part 2
3,Cummings MS Reading class,It is about two friends that go to the bluffs.One of them decides to go to the river that is where they past by.When they were swimming one dares the other to race him to the sandbar.When one of them turns back the other boy is not there anymore.He believes that his best friend has drowned.I Learned that telling the truth is better then telling lies.
4,cummings MS reading class,"The book ""ON my HONOR"" was a good book that two boys that named Joel and Tony.And the book was sad because Tony drowned in the river because Tony lied to Joel that he knew how to swim but realy he didn't. I would really recomend this book to other readers because it's a good book."
3,Meh,"I read this book in fifth grade, and now I'm in seventh. I didn't really enjoy this book, because I don't like books that are too full of moral or are too meaningful.This book is about two boys, Joel and Tony. The first time I read this book, I remember thinking, ""What a liar,"" about Joel. Both boys lied to their fathers, but since Tony died, it was unfair that nothing happened to Joel.Of course, then I realized that Joel felt really guilty about Tony's accident.I can't say I absoulutely hated this book, but I was a little disappointed, since at first On My Honour seemed like an action-packed book."
2,On My Honor-The Truth,Let's climb the bluffs. Joel and Tony are riding bikes the state park. On the way they stop to swim in the Vermillion River.Joel and Tony go for a swim. Something bad happens.This book is all about emotions and how to make the right chioces. I thought this book was just about being safe. The ending was boring and confusing but lots of kids can relate to the situation. I wouldn't recomend this book to people that like adventure books.
1,"Too dark for elementary readers, my 10-year old daughter hated it","My daughter complained about ""hating"" this book, so I bought it and read it in an hour or so. It is very dark, and I don't recommend it, especially for sensitive children. Two boys go out for a bike ride. One is coerced by his friend to engage in very dangerous acts, including swimming in a river with a strong current. The latter friend drowns and the former spends the rest of the book feeling bad about it, even wishing on three separate occassions to be dead. And not in a vague sense, but in very specific ways like being sucking under the tires of a semi. Really! He doesn't admit to anyone that he knows what happens until the end, so he spends the whole book feeling awful. There is not even a tiny glimpse of happiness in this book from page 1. A Newberry Winner? Maybe I ought to get crackin' on a depressing book about teens making bad choices -- maybe I'll win an award."
1,On My Honor book review ...,This book really stinks I dont even want to give it one star.In this book when a kid drowns in a dangerous river and the other kid is left to tell what they were going to do and what happend.
3,Required summer reading selection,"This book was a choice for my son's required summer reading. He would recommend it. The book wasn't too long and he read it quickly. It was a different genre than he typically reads, but he liked it."
1,on my honor,"this book stinks. it is a corny story about two boys who don't do what they're supposed to and something bad happens. it is all about making the right choices and doing good things. the one boy is so stupid that he jumps in the river and he can't even swim. i don't think this book even deserves one star. if you like corny stories with dheesy endings, this is the book for you."
1,"Good book for some, but not for school assignment","I was assigned this book in elementary school and it traumatized me. Sure, some kids need to read about this sort of thing, and it's not poorly written, but there are enough sensitive kids out there who either have an over developed sense of morality or who are too young for it who will not appreciate the subject matter, and I was definitely one of those. It may be OK for some kids when someone decides on an individual basis, but not for a broad swath of kids, like in a classroom."
3,On My Honor,"This book wasn't really that good. It kind of depressed me, but if you like to be depressed, this book is great. On My Honor is best for perverted sadists between 9-13."
5,Excellent read for junior high and up,"This is a very good book about the consequences of peer pressure, and reckless behavior. Unlike what another reviewer has said, there is no 'detailed description' of the boy's drowning. And, any child old enough to read this book is old enough to have heard or read the word, 'hell'. That being said, this is a book for middle schoolers and up. A child has to have some experience with peer pressure, and the desire to prove oneself to one's friends, to appreciate this story."
4,Excellent adventure book,"If you want to read a excellent adventure book, this is the one to read. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. Most books start out really boring, but this one jumps right into action. after you read the first few chapters, it keeps you guessing on what really happened and what will happen next. It's a pretty short book. It consists of twelve chapters of seven to eleven pages long. It is very easy to read. I highly recommend that you read this outstanding, Newberry Award winning book. Thank you for spending your extra time and spending it on reading my book review."
2,On My Honor,"On My Honor is written by Marion Dane Bauer. This book teaches you about guilt. Joel has to live with the guilt after Tony dies. This book begins in Illinois in the summer time. Joel and Tony are the main characters in the story. One day Tony drowns in the Vermllion River, because Joel dares him to swim to the sandbar. Joel keeps lying about where Tony is and what happened to him. At the end the book Joel tells the truth and learns he has to live the guilt. I think next year the seventh graders probably wouldn't like On My Honor. I would prefer you to read something else that is a little longer. I would recommend this book for nine to thirteen year olds."
3,on my honor,"The setting of my book is at the Starved Rock Bluff. The conflict in my book is Joel, Tonys friend dose'nt want to climb the cliff. But Tony wants to. The plot in my book Tony wants Joel to climb the cliff. The resoulution of my book is Tony gets his friend Joel to climb the cliff and they have a good time doing it."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read!,"On My Honor was dreadfully boring. It is repititous and says the same thing over and over, just like that sentence. It is absolutely the worst. Don't waste your time reading On My Honor."
3,"West Islip, NY 5th grade reader",On My Honor is a great book! I would recommend this book to all of the kids that like to read. It is exiting and sad. There is a lot of lying. It made me realize that you should always listen to your parents.
4,CUMMING MS CLASS.,I think that the story was cool.I like the part when they were in the bridge.When Tony was drowning Joel wanted to save him.
3,On My Honor,"I think the book ""On My Honor"" was a pretty good book. The book was a cliff hanger because you didn't know what dwas going to happen next,everthing kept getting turned around.I thought it was easier to relate to because it was about young kids.The part I didn't like was the part about the young kid dieing its just too much of a turn around. I woukldn't recommend this book to older kids because I don't think they would like it.Although I don't think it would interest older kids,I do think it would interst younger kids. I think it would be fun for them to read it."
3,Well written but deppressing.,"Reviewed by Alex, Grade 6.The book On My Honor by Marion Dane Bauer was not a great book for me. Personally , I like action packed, non-emotional books. This was not one of them. Basically all that happens is a kid's friend drowns in the first thirty pages and he spends the rest of the book breaking down in different ways including blaming his dad, his friend, his brother and his self. It did, however win the Newbury honor. I can see why it did, it is well written, but that does not mean I liked it. It does include very mild language but it should be no problem for mature elementary or middle schoolers. In conclusion this novel is quality, but it is not for those who like happy, exciting reads."
3,This book is o.k.,"I did not like this book for a couple of reasons.The first thing I did not like was the title of the book It was not very catchy,but one thing that I did like about the book was what the book was about.The worst part of the book was when the kid drowns and dies.,but the best part is when they are on there bikes riding to the river.The most vivid thing to me was the characters ,beacause the author did a good job explaining them.And the theme of the book was very fun to read,beacause he was very specific and the author wrote the book step by step."
4,On My Honor,The book that I am reading is called On My Honor by Marion Dane Bauer. This book is a very great book. I gave it a 4 star rating.I think anyone who loves adventure should read this book. The main caracters are Tony Zabrinsky and Joel. They are very good freinds. Tony is very adventures while Joel he just like to chill. I am going to tell you one very good thing that happened in this story. In kind of like the beggining of the book Tony gets the idea to climb the bluffs which are mountains. Joel is not really into all of that so he tried to talk him out of doing it. But on the way to the bluffs Tony say a Vermillion which is a river. A very nasty river. He got a new idea to swim in it. Joel really didn't like that idea. He really tried to talk him out of that. But Tony ends of Getting lost in the river. You need to read the book to find out what happens in the rest of the story. This book is a really great book and I encourage you to read it.
5,Joel's Promise,"On My Honor was a great book and that is why I recommend it. The reason why is, the tragedy that happens to Tony. One normal day when they rode their bikes up to Starved Rock they stopped by the Vermous River to rest, and take a swim in the river when suddenly something awful happened to Tony. That day changed Joel's whole look on life. ""On My Honor"" is a gripping page turner, since this book is a big, tragedy between two boys. From this book I learned that telling the truth is the best thing to do. People who like suspenseful and tragic books should read "" On My Honor."""
4,Jana's Awesome Review of On My Honor,"On My Honor is a great adventure book.It tells about two boys that are best friends. One horrible day they go off somewhere that they are not supposed to. One boy gets into trouble and something really bad happens. This book is really good and I recommend it to anyone who likes adventure and can not put down the book because you can't wait to see what happens next! Many people have told me that they love this book. So, go out to your local library and check out this awesome book!"
3,The Amazing Review Of On My Honor by:Ginny,"In the begining of on My Honor was interesting, and as I went on I got more interrested in the book. It has a very good rising action to the climax. It slowy drops down and ends the book. I really think you would enjoy reading this book so go to the public library and check it out."
4,Book Review of On My Honor,"On My Honor has 90 pages, and this book is for young kids. This book is about a promise. The main characters are Joel and Tony. Joel made the promise with his father that he would only stay at the park with his friend, Tony. They didn't keep their promise and went to the Vermillion River to swim. By a dare from the Joel, they raced to the sandbar. When Joel got there, Tony had drowned. The story gets complicated because of the broken promise. Joel has to tell his father that Tony drowned, but his father would know that they did not keep their promise. I think this book is good because it gives you a life lessn about keeping promises."
3,ON My Honor,"...This review is about On my Honor by Marion Dane Bauer. It is a fiction book with 92 pages it was published in 1986. It was published by Bantam Doubleday, which is a famous children&#65533;s publisher since the 1800&#65533;s. I think On my Honor was an okay book. One thing I thought was really good about it was the plot and theme. I liked the plot because it had action involved. The theme taught a big lesson of reassurance that you need in life.While I liked the book, there were more parts I didn&#65533;t like then I liked. I did not like it because certain points in the book got dragged out. The events could have been stated shorter than the author made it. Although the main topics involved action, the other events were not action packed and got really boring. Overall if you like a quick, easy book with a sad ending this is the book for you."
3,leahs review,"In the book On My Honor,by Marion Dane Bauer, the main characters are Tony and Joel.Tony is daring and outgoing.Joel is the responsable one and is very shy Joel dares Tony to go swimming in the Vermillion River. The Vermillhon River is red from clay, and is filled with sink holes nd lots of junk. tony cant swin so he drownds. joel tries to find him but he cant. Joel and his family are left behind to deal with the problem. Thos book is okay. I dont really care for it alot because it doesnt really apply to me. On my honor is a good book for children ages 10-13."
4,happy end,"The story of a young man determined to overcome his manic depression... This autobiography is written with self- effacement. It's very easy for the reader to have empathy for him, and to imagine his pain and his long fight. To recommend to all disorder sufferers, but also their family, friends, and the general public who wants to learn more about this illness. The happy end gives you the motivation to continue the struggle against the disease."
2,An angry young man,"What could have been a good account is spoiled by an angry (and perhaps immature) attitude. It perhaps gives some insight to mania but the message is confused by the author's anger and self inflated opinion of his own talent. He seems rather proud and boastful of his past history of violence, anti-social behaviour and demeaning outlook to women. He will not prove popular to the female readers. There are better and more rational books which would offer more to those of us who are interested in this area of health."
4,Bosch is good but get the Delphi this time.,"I ordered this unit and ended up returning it. Not for defect per say, but I realized that Delphi is the only manufacturer at my time of purchase (Oct/2011) that has corrected an electrical problem with this model fuel pump. It was $30 more when I purchased and included the new wiring adapter harness with a little heavier gauge wire. So, it won't be exactly plug-n-play for this reason and will require minimal wiring work splicing it in. The original design flaw was inadequate wiring shortening the life of the pump. When I look now at the product image I can see the difference on the connections. Btw, this part is for the four door model GMC Jimmy and there is a different model for two door model. For goodness sakes, on an ugly job like this, stay away from the cheap crap garbage that may not even make it down the street as I do know some horror stories."
4,Happy,SAVED BIG MONEY OVER LOCAL AUTO PARTS STORE ON THE SAME NAME BRAND AND INSTALLED MYSELF HECK I COULD HAVE HIRE IT DONE AND STILL CAME OUT AHEAD
4,Good Book,I picked this book for the simple humor of being a single mother. I needed a definite pick up and knowledge for myself that I wasn't the only one out there. My only disappointment would be the lack of information that wasn't provided in the book to where I could go for more support. Some parts of the book she made it sound so easy and other parts you could tell what struggles she had being a single mother. I would definitely read it if not just for the simple humor that every single parent needs to get through those really bad days. It will make you feel less alone and more confident that no matter what you can and will get through it on your own.
5,the single mother's survival guide,"finally, a book that doesn't make you feel bad for wanting to feed your kid a happy meal and forget your a mom for about 15mins. until they spill the darn sprite on your carpet. the book was funny and made light of some subjects that you can take serously, i think anyone who needs a pick me up and smile can benefit from this book. lord knows we can all use the a single mom discount(which she told us about, and it works) as long as you bat your eyelashes and look desparate. this book is great and i will read over and over again. also if you e-mail her she does respond back. which is nice to know she cares. patrice keep up the good work and man i love your book."
1,Lacking in substance,"I was quite disappointed in the book, finding it lacking in substance. It is full of cliches and platitudes and offers very little practical information and advice. The author repeatedly advises giving children fast food and putting them in front of the television without concern for the consequences. She also instructs stressed-out mothers to go to spas and get massages--I guess she can afford them. The writer is a ""motivational speaker"" so that gives a clue as to the depth of the content. It's about as informative as a greeting card, really. I found THE COMPLETE SINGLE MOTHER much more worth reading."
5,GOOD READING,"This is an easy-to-follow and uplifting book for any single parent, be they a mom or dad. Good insight and encouragement."
4,Review From A Single Dad,"I encourage single parents, male or female to make this a part of your library. Especially for full-time single dads. Often we can feel ""out there"" on our own. But Patrice Karst does a phenomenal job of relating to the feelings and encounters that single parents often feel only happen to them. Most importantly, she does it all with a humorous, honest and down to earth approach that leaves you feeling inspired and ready to take on the daily challenges of parenting alone or apart from your child's father/mother. Patrice includes a note to single dad's in the book which explains why she is addressing the single mom's alone. She definitely hits home with her target audience, but don't worry, guys. She hits home with us as well. I recommend this book highly."
4,Married mom-living like a single mom....,"Great book. I am married, but living like a single mom. Trust me on that one. I do everything mentally and physically. The book had great ideas, suggestions, opinions, and a great sense of humor too. Good luck to not only single moms-but all moms! :-)"
2,Fluff,"I agree with the reviewer who said this book is lightweight. If you need encouraging hallmark-style aphorisms, pick this one up. If you want actual helpful hints for survival, don't bother. I was looking for the latter and was disappointed."
2,Disappointed.,The book was easy to read but it was disappointing. I feel like the author took single motherhood as a funny thing to laugh at. Didn't provide much insight. I would recommend not buying. If you are looking for a laugh or something to just browse thru then I would spend the couple of bucks.
3,I have read better but this is a good one.,"This was a great book, but i came across another one afterwards and it blew me away. Its called ""The Little Book Of Inspiration For Single Moms"". It is so touching because it helps you get through hard times and many single parents can relate to the same things discussed in the book. You can get one at [...] > You should get one now because i heard it is about to be advertised on Oprah. This will cause the price to go up."
1,Not much useful info here...,"This book struck me as being mostly common sense. It's cute, and might make a clever gift for a new single mother, but for someone looking for useful info it's pretty light on that."
3,some helpful bits,"This book although bright and cheery was a bit of a disappointment. It has a lot of pick me up advise but quite frankly it didn't say anything new. It is great if you need cheering on or some words of comfort or are new to solo parenting and it has some good points on societies attitude and lack of help for solo mother's. Solo Dad's are not included, however much of the content would be as relevant for them."
1,Choose a Better Book,"I bought two other books at the same time and found both of them to very useful, particularly The Complete Single Mother. I also recommend Single Mothers by Choice. I found this book to be dismissable. It gives very little usable advice and trivilizes serious problems. Please read the other one star ratings before wasting your money."
1,A book of lists,"This book was a disappointment. I was expecting more than a book of lists containing many ""fill-in-the-blanks"" pages at the end. Even Chicken Soup for Single Parents was better than this very slim book that has practically no content."
2,Not too impressed...,"As a woman who made a conscious decision to become a single parent, I found this book very elementary. It did not give me any solid, new information about how to get by on a day to day basis. I think it would be much more helpful for those who find themselves single parents and are not happy about it. It was nicely written and I got a kick out of a few sections. I could have gotten enough out of it by skimming through in a book store."
5,Very encouraging!,"I got the book, and was surprised to find how useful it was. It encouraged me in a way no one in my life has, and understood just what us, single mothers, go through every day. It made me realize how imporant the job we do really is, and how important it is for us, single moms to be there for one another and be supportive of eac other. I recommend it. Good Luck to you with yours!"
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL SINGLE MOTHERS,"Patrice Karst really puts in perspective the life of a single mother. Her sense of humor is wonderful. Any single mother, no matter what their circumstances are, should have this book. It is a book you can refer to over and over. She gives us hope and courage to be the best we can be."
2,entertaining but not helping...,"When I first read all the great recommendations for this book I went out to every single store to find it, and finally found it at Amazon.com.Once I had it I was very disappointed.I couldn't really find answers to my questions or some kind of guidelines where to go to find support or help.It is very humerous but that's about it."
5,Stressed Single Mom,Thank You Patrice Karst. You have written a book that will definitely help with the stress of single motherhood. This book has made me open my eyes a whole new world. I know now that I am not alone anymore. The wisdom and truth in this book really hits a nerve. It made me realize that I can be a person as well as a good mother at the same time. It showed me that I can be strong and believe in myself while still raising my 1.3 year old. I hope that every single mother out there reads this book and it helps them as much as it did me.
2,Might want to skip this one...,"Doesn't really tell you much that most of us don't already know: It's a difficult job, to take care of ourselves as well as our children and that we aren't alone.I read the entire book in an hour. Many of the pages just have a few sentences of her thoughts... I was looking for a book with more substance and suggestions, not simple commiseration. I don't feel that there's any real practical advice but it's not a bad bathroom book for when you only have a minute or two.One great line in the book though: When a married woman tells you that she could NEVER do what you're doing - tell her that's too bad because there's a 50% chance that she'll have to. I simply cannot wait to use that one."
3,Not much new wisdom...,"I enjoyed this book but it is really about a night's read. There's not much in here I didn't know, it was reaffirmation rather than learning from a single mom about things I didn't know.If you're looking for advice, it isn't here; if you're looking to commiserate and feel that you're doing just fine as a single mom, then you'll enjoy the witty comments."
3,Very cute! Very liberating!,I ordered this book for myself as a single parent. It was cute in a small book size carry in your tote -pop it out- on the bus kind of day. Full of witty antedoctes of being a single parent - good advice - and reminders to take good care of yourself. I was kind of wanting something a little deeper but this is not the book for that kind of read. Good little book.
4,Just what I needed...,"I found this book on a day I needed it most. It's a quick, easy read that made me smile, cry and most importantly, gave me hope. No, it's not going to solve all your problems (what book is?), but it does put the challenges of being a single mom in perspective, reminds you you are not alone and offers much needed encouragement. I would buy this for any single mom I know!"
5,"Single parents, if ya need a lift today, read this!",This funny yet realistic book helped me deal with some tough issues and brought a smile to my face. It's the kind of thing you need to read when looking at parenthood alone.
1,No stars-Tv sucks-bulb gone after 4 months,"I was soo get this tv.......4 months later, the honeymoon is over. The bulb is gone, and I like how many others, am online to buy a replacement bulb...One has to question, is this the new Toshiba way to keep their hands in customers pockets? Never again Toshiba-never never again-nothing from your company til I die...I hope the rip off bulbs are worth losing lifetime customers...Michelle"
3,"BEWARE of the ""DLP Tax""","EDIT FEB 09: 1.5 years later and another *&%*^&%(&^)(*&%$ POP... time to spend another $200 on a bulb... this is UNSAT!I bought this TV in Nov 06 (manf Oct 06). GREAT picture... but it started to go dimmer in June and in July, POP!! I do a search for Toshiba DLP bulb replacement and there are THOUSANDS of hits on the problems with the bulbs in Toshiba's DLP TVs. Some bulbs only last 2-3 months. Toshiba is aware of the problem and extended the warranty on the ORIGINAL bulb to 2 years... but on replacement bulbs it is only 180 days. There are numerous people who have had to replace bulbs a couple times a year. At $200 a pop, this is one heck of a ""tax"" to operate this TV. The picture is great and I love the TV, but if I knew I'd have to spend $200 a year to keep it going, I'd have just spent that money towards something that would last me longer.Google the subject before you buy so you'll be an informed consumer!"
3,Toshiba=Deception,"This TV is stellar when it comes to features and picture, but it is decietfully labled as a 1080p television. What they fail to tell you is that the only input on the TV that accepts a 1080p signal is one of the coaxle connections. Niether of the HDMI inputs on the TV can accept a 1080p signal; they top out at 1080i. 1080i is the same resolution, but if you are planning on watching cg movies or games or fast moving action do not buy this tv. It is an excellent picture for a decent price, but it is border-line false advertising. I have been a loyal customer for Toshiba(3 laptops and this TV), but it seems my faith in them has been sold out."
