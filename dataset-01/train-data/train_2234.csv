2,Don't buy it,"This device is cheap, it looks good in the picture but is poor quality. I have had nothing but trouble with it. It will not support playlist for songs stored on a SD card. The songs display the wrong artist when switching tracks. Sometimes it will not turn off or the menu will not come up. After several support calls and e-mails to Rio, I gave up, their technichians could not resolve the issue of the playlist. Spend your money instead on anything from Creative Labs, their stuff is always top quality and dependable."
2,Cheap Construction,"This unit was in my possession for only 3 days. The battery cover constantly comes off and the battery will fall out.The interface and screen is pretty nice, as well as the button placement. Sound quality was also excellent.Its cheap construction cannot be overlooked. My unit's battery cover didn't even lineup correctly with the case. Pass on this one."
2,5 Stars for the unit... 1 star for Rio's Customer service,"I would have to agree completely that the unit is practical, light, compact and sounds very nice considering the size and prize range... The watchout: the Rio Music manager software can't encode mp3 songs unless you download an upgrade from the net which you can do only three times, so, if you change your computer or just want to install it more than three times you might as well forget about using mp3's.Oh, calling customer service? right... I've been waiting for an answer 10 days and counting."
4,Seems okay to me.,"I should start out by saying that the Rio Chiba is the first MP3 player I've ever seen in person. I won it in a radio station contest. As others have stated they have a problem with the battery door coming off, I have not had that problem, mine snaps into place securely. Regarding the software, I was able to use it pretty easily without reading hardly any of the instructions. I'm moderately computer savvy so I think that says a lot. I think the sound is great although I agree it could be a little louder. The tuner doesn't get the best reception but I don't use it much for that anyway. I think it's a good little player but again, it's the only one I've had any experience with."
1,Don't buy if you're an audiophile,"I purchased the Rio Chiba with hopes to not have to carry around a portable CD player anymore. Unfortunately I had to go back to the CD's. The Chiba's interface and size seemed nice enough to make me buy it, but I only had to listen to it once before putting it down. I tired a few different songs from different genres (all recorded at 192 kbps or higher) and couldn't get one to sound good. There was no bass, the mids were thin and the trebel was tinny. I suppose if you're not huge on sound quality, you may find this unit appealing for it's other features, but if you're picky on sound, look elsewhere (the iPod and iPod clones all seem much nicer)."
4,"Good overall, except ear pieces","I just got my Rio and I must say, it's easy to use and sounds good. I took it out running and I live in a busy area. I only had the volume up to ~20 and had no problems--I thought it was plenty loud and had no desire to take it up to the max of 30. My only complaint is that the ear pieces are very uncomfortable to me and I had a hard time getting them to stay in place, on top of it. I ended up walking the rest of the way. Once I get new ear buds, I'll be happy. I was a little worried when I ordered it that the belt clip wouldn't be adequate to run--I'm no longer concerned. It didn't budge--felt very secure. And I LOVE the FM radio feature!!! It came in perfectly clear and, being that I haven't transferred many songs to it yet, let me test it out without boredom."
3,"Its ok, but for 200 bucks...","The sound is good, could be louder..and for 200 bucks they could have made it stronger, the battery lid comes off really easy, its amazing they cant get the most simple aspect of the machine right. Im taking it back tomorrow!"
3,Good for first MP3 players,"The Rio Chiba was the very MP3 player I've ever gotten and it was pretty good, though I did have some issues with the software. The sound was good and it held a large amount of songs. The Rio fits into pockets and purses comfortably so the size is not an issue. In short, the Rio is great for beginners to the world of MP3s. I have an iPOD now and it isn't even comparable so I wouldn't recommend this to you if you've had a good MP3 player in the past. For the price, this is a fairly good MP3 player."
3,Bingo Cards,I am sorry I didn't read the ad better. Did not realize that by ordering 2 packs that we would get exactly the same numbers on both sets.....this really creates a problem....have had to put half of them away and use old cards we thought we were replacing.
1,Disappointed with my purchase,I am not satisfied with the product at all. This fragrance is nothing like the original fragrance. I still have the bottle I purchased two years ago at the Lalique Store located in the Cayman Islands and the color and small are completely different. I wear this fragrance and it feels like I am wearing no perfume at all. Never again will I purchase a perfume from this website.
1,Beautiful but distructive,"BUYER BEWARE! I agree with the other reviews, these plates are BEAUTIFUL! Great size and shape, I have the Sage color as well. However, I used them for the first time last night at a dinner party and the bottoms of the plates and cups are so rough they scratched my solid oak, espresso stained table! Each place a cup or plate was set that wasn't on a placemat there were small scratches left behind. If you always use a table cloth or have a granite or stone table they would be fine, but I wouldn't ever put them on a quality wood table again. Fortunately Amazon makes returning easy."
4,Great purchase,"I'm very happy with these dishes. The only slight disappointment is that the color in the photo is lighter than the actual dishes. They still match my kitchen, so that's ok. I love the coffee/tea cup. It is easy to hold, which is very important. Overall, this purchase was a winner."
1,These plates may contain LEAD!,"I have these in sage green and also a toffee brown color. Some of these ""hand glazed"" ""microwave safe"" dishes get EXTREMELY HOT in the microwave - we measured as high as 230 degrees after 2 minutes in the microwave - above boiling! I suspect they contain lead. The manufacturer is Tabletops Unlimited. Target and the manufacturer both claim to know nothing about it and refuse to talk about it or provide refund."
5,"Global perspective, global understanding","If you read Amory Starr's book, you know that the protests in Seattle weren't the first against corporate globalization. ""Naming the Enemy"" explains how this movement has grown from local campaigns against local problems to a planet-wide movement against a companies that turn people and the environment into commodities. Impeccably researched but written without using academic jargon, readable without being condescending, ""Naming the Enemy"" is one of the most important political science books in recent memory."
4,"A Good Puzzle, but faintly depressing.","I am a big fan of Caroline Graham, and I love her characters - Barnaby and Troy. This book has a pretty good puzzle. Some of the characters were quite well drawn, but I found the book faintly depressing. I wonder if the whole side bar with Brian was really necessary to the story? I found that part of the book quite distasteful actually. There comes a time when storylines like that one can be thought of as sensationalizing since they do not really add to the story. But other than that I enjoyed this book. The dust jacket says that Caroline Graham shows humour and pathos in her stories, and I think that is really true. Barnaby is a really appealing main character, and I want to continue to read in order to get to know him better."
3,Cute but......,This toy is cute but it does get boreing. There is only so much that you can do with a toy like this and it is really just one of those things that was fun to play with in the store and ended up in the back of my closed after a day or two.
2,Fun! ... for a little while...,"When I first saw these toys in the store, they looked so cute that I just had to buy one. When I first started playing with it, it was fun to see all the different movements and the way it would react to input. But I have to agree with most of the reviewers of this toy - it's a bit boring. After the novelty of this toy wore off, I started questioning my purchase. It's extremely limited in that there's no real reward or consequence in the way you care for this toy (Ã  la Tamagotchi); and, as many people have already mentioned, all the chirping does get annoying after a while. Also, I started noticing some discoloration in the water after several months (my Aquapet now exists in a tank of yellowish water). You should know that when you purchase this toy for yourself or your children, it is for entertainment and novelty only - it has no educational value."
1,What toy??,"This is More of an adult novelty... I dont have one, But it looks too much like a Vibrator to give to any kids. My wife said that It looks too much like a toy she might buy for pleasure than for a hild."
2,Something Just Ain't Right,"I thought this stripper would be awesome but I am really disappointed with it. Doesn't seem to cut the sizes it says, just an awkward product. Recommend trying another brand. You can spend half as much for a better Klein 1011."
4,"Good, but not my preferred wire stripper","Being indecisive, I ordered both the Ideal 45-918 Kinetic Reflex Stripper and the Paladin 1117 GripP. Basically, the Paladin is easier for me to use and makes a cleaner cut through the wire's insulation. Side note: These tools are being used on a light-duty basis by a hobbiest who has lost a lot of grip strength due to RA."
3,A bit disappointing,"Bought this for my husband, but it must not be the CD we had previously owned as he said many of the songs weren't worth listening to. Still enjoys several of them, though! Especially Route 66 :)"
1,Very Disapointed!,"I had the priviledge of seeing and hearing ATW on several occasions in the 70's & 80's, with the best sessions at Cain's Ballroom in T-town where I grew up. I was expecting Ray Benson to be the lead singer on all the old favorites, not just some. Sorry, but without Ray singing Take Me Back To Tulsa, Route 66, and Miles And Miles Of Texas, it just isn't ATW. I feel duped by the fact the title says ""Original recording remastered"". Maybe these songs are remastered, but I expected remastered recordings with Ray Benson. I guess it's my fault for not listening to the samples available (pulling a** kicking machine lever now). If you liked this CD, then you will really like ATW with Ray singing the classics. Try ""Very Best of Asleep at the Wheel"" available from Amazon, and you will be in for a real treat!"
2,Looks nice - especially for the price - but ripped right away,"We attempted to put up this tent at home and while trying to stake it down, one of the fabric stake loops tore off of the tent. We never even got it erected. This was an important loop, as it was supposed to support two of the main tent poles. Very surprising, as previous Coleman tents I've used have never been a problem. I'd recommend trying another tent."
1,"It seems like the perfect tent, until it rains","I saw this tent and was really excited because it seemed to perfectly fit our family's needs. Then I took it camping on a weekend and got rained on. As a lifelong fan of their camping equipment, I was pretty let down. Despite all the claims that Coleman makes about this tent, including its ""Keeps You Dry"" Guarantee, few are true. We had large pools of water in the tent after just one rain. I wrote the company and complained, and was sent a letter that basically insulted my intelligence regarding the use of their seam sealer, which I seriously recommend you buy if you purchase this tent. Read the claims Coleman makes about this tent and you'd feel pretty comfortable taking it anywhere in any weather. Not even close. Keep looking."
4,Spacious tent!,"This tent can be a little challenging to put up the first few times, but once you figure it out it's easy. It is a great size for multiple campers. You could easily fit 2 full sized air mattresses. We use it to camp with our 2 bulldogs and they love it too. Only downside is, there is NO PRIVACY in this tent unless you put up the rain fly. Other than that, we loved it."
5,Great Tent Great Price,"This is a large, roomy tent that is really great, especially for the price. It sets up very quick, and is one of the only tents that I can stand up inside of. My entire family can sleep comfortably and store our gear. (My wife, two boys, 11 and 14, and two dogs). This tent is comparable to most $200 tents"
1,Don't buy this tent if you want to stay dry.,All that I can say is that I did not enjoy water dripping in my face while I was trying to sleep. It rained and this tent leaked from a multitude of places.
1,Abject failure,"The package says ""Chicken Flavored Gravy Mix"", but this is neither chicken, flavored, nor gravy. I suppose the word ""mix"" is still appropriate.It has the appearance of jenkem and the smell of fish food flakes. I can't believe I wasted the rest of my potato flakes on this stuff. Now what will I eat."
4,"Very nice, quick gravy",My husband is a gravy lover with high blood pressure. Hain has nice flavor and no meat fats..and lower sodium than many other gravy mixes. It is lumpfree and very tasty. What more could you ask for in a healthy fast food. Buy with confidence.
2,yuk! can I return the rest for a refund?,"This gravy mix tastes terrible!, and the powdered onion aftertaste unfortuneately lingers even after a vigorous toothbrushing, but a good mouthwash got rid of it, thankfully. It doesn't mix in water very easy bcause of sticky lumps too.I want to return the rest of it for a refund."
5,Good stufff for the soul,This album represents some of the best music for children I have ever hear. Positive messages. Great performances and just great fun. More like this shopuld come from Disney.
3,A Disappointment,"I purchased this cd based on other reviews here on Amazon, and my son and I are both disappointed with its dull, show tune styling. The intention of the album may be admirable, but the material and delivery are far from inventive. This album is likely to appeal to lovers of Raffi and Broadway musicals and the like, but it seriously lacks depth and feeling. The producer obviously has some good show biz connections, with an impressive list of performers. Unfortunately, this collection of performers just ends up being a cute idea rather than an amazing listening experience. Any comparison to ""Free to Be, You and Me"" borders on offensive.For some truly terrific family music that is beautiful, fun, inspiring, creative, moving, and world-changing, check out these performers instead: Dan Zanes, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Justin Roberts."
2,ok,"took forever to arrive to me, very like dusty and very old, but it is readable. I did not get to read the book itself yet."
1,Bad Sound,This CD makes Ray Charles sound like he is singing into a tin can. Terrible sound quality.
4,Cute Story,"Well... I illustrated this book so I'm slightly biased, but I thought the story was incredibly sweet and would be very educational for new young readers."
1,Transdimensional Warping,"Similar to other reviewers, my pan warped by the third use. What struck me as odd about this is that it wasn't just a little warped, but really warped, like it momentarily turned to rubber and then twisted a good two inches (diagonally opposite corners raising). It looked like my oven had phased the pan into another dimension and then had trouble getting it back to our reality. Overall this is really too bad, since the pan is a perfect size and all of our other All Clad cookware is of an extremely high quality."
3,manufacture,"Just so you know, this pan is made in China, not USA like many other All Clad products. It would be nice if Amazon published the country of origin so people could know before they purchased."
3,Not deep enough,"This is a nice-looking pan, but not deep enough for lasagna. Does anyone make a deep dish lasagna pan that's doesn't weigh a ton?"
3,GREAT,THIS IS GREAT MY PARENTS GOT ME ONE FOR MY LAPTOP AFTER I STARTED GETTING NECK PAINS. EVER SINCE IV'E BEEN USING THE OYSTER MY NECK PAINS HAVE GONE AWAY I ALWAYS USE MY OYSTER.ALSO IT GOES GREAT WITH A LOGITECH WIRELESS MOUSE AND KEYBOARD. ALSO THE EXTRA USB PORTS WERE ALSO HELP. I RECOMMENED THIS TO ANYONE WHO HAS A LAPTOP AND THEY USE IT MORE AT HOME THEN ON THE ROAD. :o)THANKS OYSTER............
3,Overheating Issues,"I've had the Oyster since December 2003 and in this time I have noticed one significant problem. The station promotes overheating by having the CPU / GPU portions of the back of the case lay flat within the station.Granted, you place the laptop on a flat counter you're going to experience the same problem, however this is could have been addressed by the manufacturer in some way. The fact that most people also put their power supply block in the back of the station with the other wires only makes it hotter back there, further contributing to the problem. I have had to mod my station to include a heat sink and a USB powered fan mounted back there to help cope with this.While I love the concept of the station, I think new versions of the design should work to address the build-up of heat back there in some way."
5,Wow.. Nothing like it!!! Buy it,"I mistakenly got a laptop that does not have a factory docking station...Here is the answer.. This thing is great, it manages your cords hold your power bar, and is really easy to plug all your wires to your laptop.. The bult in USB is great... only a minor complaint. Only 2 external usb slots (it has 2 internal ports)Bottom line: If you dont have a factory dock and stand .. BUY THIS! I looked at some other lesser ones that I was scared my laptop woud fall and did not manage the cords as well."
3,"Nice Reference Book or for Kids, But...","This is hardly the best Asimov non-fiction out there. For the adult reader, I'd recommend any collection of his SF&F articles. I have this book and I've read most of it (this is coming from someone who's read at least 70 or 80 Asimov books), but I wouldn't strongly recommend it. If you're really interested, try your local library or used bookstore. Save your money for some of Asimov's better works."
4,Great Read (as usual) -- but a bit simplistic,"Asimov's writing is in tip top form -- clear,straightforward, and with his sense of wit that is always present.However, some of the questions are pretty elementary for most of his fans -- e.g., why does the moon go through phases, what is the future of our sun, what are tides...Important questions, to be sure, but, not as engaging on his writings concerning the beginning of the universe, the atom, or measurements."
3,The Good Doctor is Out There,"Isaac Asimov assembles 111 of his short, non-fiction essays into a question-and-answer book that teaches us about the Earth and its neighborhood. These answers are accessible to older children as well as adults. They are written in Asimov's conversational style that makes science seem so straightforward. A warning label is appropriate to remind us that some of these answers no longer represent current thinking. But most have aged well.My favorites include:- How old is the Earth?- Is the Earth hollow?- Is there life on Mars?- How fast does light travel?- What is the Galaxy?- Does anything reach us from the stars besides light?- What is in interstellar dust clouds?These short essays are a good reminder of the science we learned in middle school. And it's nice to hear the Good Doctor's voice again. Readers may also enjoyAsimov's Guide to the BibleandAsimov's Guide to Shakespeare."
4,Suspenseful romance torn by betrayal...,"Bobbi Smith's historical romance 'Eden' is the epitomy of Civil War romance. Eden LeGrand is a young woman in Confederate Louisiana. Though she usually helps at the Homeless Haven Orphans' Asylum, she is also dedicated to the Rebel cause, often planning with Confederate spies. On a search for his brother injured on a steamboat, Logan Matthews works undercover for the Union. Disguised as a reverend, he vows to find who is responsible for his brother's imprisonment by tracking Adrian Forrester, the owner of the Haven. From its passion filled words to its action packed turns, this book will keep you reading and wanting for more. Bobbi Smith really lives up to her title as New York Times 'Best Seller' with Eden."
2,Tend to break,"It worked OK for a couple of months, but then I came to charge it up one day and it broke. There seemed to be some fire inside because it became really hot and smelt of burnt electronics. It had only lasted 10 weeks.When it was working, it was OK, though."
1,The RIO Nitrus Sucks!!!!,The Nitrus' internal hard disk failed after 4 months (warranty of 90 days) of limited use!! They offered to replace it for $125. I will buy a better product next time!!!!
1,RIP OFF!!!!!!!,"who is the genius that thought this piece of crap up. It sucks, i went through two of them with their own different problems before i gave up and shelled out the extra cash for an iPod. The first player had an off center joystick so that i could not scroll forward through my songs, only backwards (very frusterating when passing a song by one click) then the second one just plain wouldn't turn on, it would get hot as hell and make a wierd clicking noise, but it would never turn on. Beleive me, go pick up an iPod for a 130 bucks more, it is well worth it for what you get."
4,Great Player,"This is a great player for the price, nabbed mine for $160!I really like how small, lite, and fluid it feels.. easily tucks away in a pocket. Ive had no issues with mine, upgraded to the latest bios with out a hitch.. not sure why others are haveing an issue with this.. duuhh..Over all, great player and highly recomended!"
1,don't buy it!,"I regret that I did not heed the reviews that recommended against purchasing this player. While some have found this player to be fine, I was unable to get it to work. After many hours spent--following all of the suggestions of the Rio support staff (both on the phone and online)--I tossed in the towel. I bought the Rio Nitrus because my Rio 500 has worked well for more than 4 years and I thought Rio had its act together--I was wrong. To make matters worse, after all of my efforts to get it working, my security software alerted me to the presence of a corrupted file and possible virus from the Rio downloads."
1,RIO NOT helpful after upgrader message,"Like many others I was really enjoying this product until 2.5 months into its life I got the upgrader message, I did the firware upgrade and software upgrades but alas still wouldnt work and i got the upgrader message. This was an inconvenience but the BAD news was to follow, RIO had no interest in my problems. I got a if you did the upgrade and it doesnt work then return it message, no we will send you out a box to return it, or please bring it to X where it will be immediately replaced. I now have a defective product and not a easy route to replacement."
1,Wish I could give zero stars...,"Rio Nitrus is the worst electronic item I have owned in my 23 years on this earth. In the 2 years I have owned it, it has not performed reliably for more than 2 weeks at a time. It continues to display the UPGRADER message, a problem which is unresolved by upgrading the firmware, as Tech Support will direct you to do. It just spontaneously starts working again on its own, and will work fine until it feels like stopping to work again. Also, when I try to put mp3's on the player it states that the song is either in use or nonexistent, neither of which is the case. Additionally, the longer the Rio stays working, more and more songs become corrupted, which causes the Rio to shut itself off mid-song more and more frequently. I would rather have no mp3 player at all than have the Rio Nitrus. I do not recommend you purchase it."
1,Does not last very long,"The product worked great for approx. 10 months and then began to re-boot automatically. I performed the firmware update and re-format that was suggested on the manufacturers website; the suggestions not only did not help but made things worse. The Nitrus currently cannot even get passed its boot-up, the system just hangs and the hard drive just spins away. Since the system never really boots up, my computer cannot recognize it and I cannot attempt another firmware upgrade.The warranty on the product is only three months and you cannot change the battery. It looks like the manufacturer did not expect the product to last very long.In my opinion, this is a poor product that has been designed for short term use. The manufacturer is probably hoping that it lasts only long enough for them to put out a newer version. They wouldn't want to hurt their sales by providing a product that lasts a long time!"
1,97 Wonderful days...,".I bought the Nitrus for my daughter and was a hero for ninety-seven days. Seven days out of warranty, seven days from saving myself $175 bucks, she now has a black piece of plastic that is too small for a doorstop, too light for a paperweight, and a despondent Dad with a short-lived hero status.After upgrading to the latest firmware, the all-too-common ""upgrader"" reared its ugly head. A very well-spoken and polite Indian lady offered several suggestions:1. Use a different USB port.2. Use a differenct computer.3. ""Snap"" it from one hand to the other.I tried each without success and now realize that, like so many other before me, I too had fallen into the stylish, sleek, and slim little black hole called ""Nitrus."""
1,Only lasted a few minutes after charge was complete,Bought the Rio Nitrus after reviewing them and seeing there were great reviews along with the bad ones. I guess you could add us to the list of the dreaded upgrader message. Downloaded a couple of books and songs and then wanted to test it with a fm transmitter and it wouldn't turn on. Just clicked away and got hot. Hate to tell the guy who said just use the reset button... must have tried that 10 times. Finally have given up and returning it. starting the search again!!!
1,Great while it worked....,"Like many others have stated, the Rio Nitrus was great while it worked. I really liked it, but then three weeks into owning it, it deleted all my files, wouldn't hold a FW upgrade and just sat there clicking away. Customer Support stated that it was a ""known problem with all harddrive-based devices"" and that it would need to be returned for another one. Well, I returned it, but decided to spend $30 more and get the Dell DJ with 15x the capacity and with the Dell name. Hopefully, their ""harddrive-based player"" will not suffer from this ""known problem."""
2,Love it.... but on my 2nd unit,"Great little player - small, light, great battery, great capacity for my needs. ""Upgrader"" bug bit me on the start of a 1 month NY to Australia trip. Thankfully, the unit was still under warranty when I returned. They eventually agreed to RMA the unit and do a cross ship (this part was VERY difficult and they wanted to charge me until I complained). Knock wood - good luck so far with the new unit. As for the support folks - blame RIO, not them. RIO gives them the policies, and they do a great job following them. It's up to RIO to change their bad policies and stand by their product. They should know better than to give their customers a hard time when they KNOW their product has issues! I fully expect to be reading about a class action lawsuit by owners at some point (like the IBM deskstar/""Deathstar"" from a couple of years back). That said, I LOVE my nitrus (now that I have a working unit) - I just worry about it's longevity."
5,I love it!,"Personally, I love this thing! No batteries to buy, it's small, it holds a lot of songs, and it sounds good! My only complaint is that fingerprints get on it easily. Buy one!"
1,Junk,"This product is a piece of junk (ZERO STARS). I got it for a gift < 6 months ago, it no longer functions at all! Their customer service is worthless. Do not waste your money on anything from this manufacturer."
1,A REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD CHOICE,Yes it is true. Mine only lasted 4 months. Stay away from this product.
1,Defective product,"Received player on Friday. It worked wonderfully for two days then the player started to delete all the mp3 files when hiting the play button. Contacted Rio and they suggested several fixes. After following their instructions, the player became unusable. They diagnosed the problem as corrupted software in the player and suggested a product return. The player was sweet when it worked and the technical support at Rio were wonderful. However, the player I received ended up being a very expensive paper-weight. The player is on its way back to Amazon."
1,o star i need help from you please,i bought a rio nitrus without the software. i took it home charged it and it plays fine. it doesn't have the upgrader problem but it will dot be recognized by my computer. have emailed rio but they are stupid indiansdownloaded rio software and driverhave xp and 98sedoesn't work on eitherif you can help please email memy address is jimmyefrye@earthlink.net or thedew02@yahoo.comif you have a rio with a bad hard drive email me and maybe i would take it from you
1,Rio NO MO,"When I attempted to upgrade the firmware as suggested by the Music Manager software, the player simply died. I reached technical support, after several minutes on hold. I spoke with a kind gentleman with choppy English (being quite kind). He took me through a number of steps and then informed me my original diagnosis (dead) was accurate. He stated the internal board was ""defective."" I purchased the Rio 7 months ago, so I was offered an ""Out of Warranty Replacement"" for $125.00. Seemed kind of pricy for a unit that is likely to last only 7 months or so. I was told that this is not an ""often problem"", but a ""sometimes problem yes."" I greatly enjoyed the Rio during it's short life span, but definitely recommend against purchasing one."
1,Will return the product,"There must be better products out there. I have had mine 7 hours(5 of those were charging) and I will take it back. If this product was beta tested by average consumers, someone had to either fix the results or Rio released a bad product. The sound is good, I like the earphones, but that is it. I charged it up and just wanted to listen to preloaded songs, it is a nightmare to just navigate those songs. The navigational button is small and randomly responds, you push the button something may happen something may not, it may start scrolling through the song, it may go to the next song, it may go to a bookmark, or most times it does nothing. Bottom line if I can't listen to the song I want to with minimal effort I don't want the product. I am also insulted that I pay $219 dollars for and I must download a manual just to do the basic functions."
1,Avoid this product,"I recieved my Rio Nitrus in December 2003 as a gift and was very pleased with it's performance. For me, the sound quality was perfect, and the fact that I didn't need to carry CD's back and forth from college was a huge plus. The Nitrus worked very well until May 2004, two months after the warrenty ended. I got the all too common ""UPGRADER"" message. I tried everything I was told to do, including upgrading the Firmware. However, I then got stuck on the ""RESTARTING"" message. Because I was out of warranty, I was told by customer support that I would need to pay $125 to replace it.In my opinion, this product is excellent if it works, but I would not take the chance on another Rio player. If you consider yourself a smart consumer, you will not either."
1,Nice while they lasted,"I bought two Rio Nitrus for Christmas 2003, one for me and one for my son. We both loved them for the few months they worked. My son's went first, losing battery capacity then losing all function. I thought maybe he had dropped it or something, although he said not. Then mine went! All of a sudden, in the middle of a song, all I get is clicking and whirring noises. Of course this all happened just after the warranty expired. It had been treated with kid gloves so I knew it was not anything I had done. Rio doesn't seem concerned about the ""little problem"" I'm having; I was told they will fix it for $125.00--only $39.00 less than I paid for it. I'll be putting that money toward an IPod."
1,Don't Be Deceived,"I purchased a Nitrus in August and I LOVED it. It was easy to add or remove music and it played really well, but only days after my 90 day warranty was up, my Nitrus went into ""upgrade mode"" and froze there. I could not reset the player, nor would a firmware update install. I called tech support and spoke to several incompetent people, none of which knew how to help me, and they all told me I was out of luck because my 90 day warranty was up, even though it was only up by 3-5 days. I never mishandeled or mistreated the player in any way, and I was listening to it as normal when it malfunctioned. I have friends that have had problems with Rio products and have read other reviews that state situations similar to mine, and I have concluded that Rio does not make a quality product. Please save the money and buy a better quality player."
1,Not a reliable product - avoid,"4 hours after purchase, my Rio Nitrus locked-up with the kiss of death message ""upgrader"". The unit refused to do anything (there was no fix to the problem) except display this message and actually generate heat! (not a good sign). Before it died, I did manage to load 5 albums and play one song. Needless to say, it was returned and I won't buy another one.In spite of other comments.... when it says ""upgrader"" it IS DEAD... no amount of paper clip resetting will fix this."
2,Good sound....Very flawed design,"I have purchased quite a few mp3 players. They all have a few qualities that separate them from the rest. The Rio Nitrus seemed to be a good mix between the larger hard drive players, and the smaller chip players. It has a nice 1.5 gig capacity in a very compact design. The sound quality is very good with some of the best earbuds I have seen in an mp3 player. The biggest problem (and it is a biggie) is the menu system. It gives you plenty of options such as Artist,Album,Tracks,Playlist, however it does not list the songs under the particular artist or album. It only gives you the choice to play all. This makes it very cumbersome to locate certain songs you wish to play. With the capacity to hold 375 songs, they should have a better way to locate them. Most mp3 players on the market give you the ability to find songs through Artist or Album. What should have been a top rated player is below average for something so simple."
2,Work's Great...but life expectancy is kinda short...,"While I haven't had the software problems that others here have posted, I have experienced something just as bad. My Rio Nitrus worked fine for the first 5 months (I did get some ""Upgrader"" message, but somehow I was able to get out of it). It's great, does its job for the most part, and is small enough to fit somewhat comfortably in the palm of your hand if you want to hold it.However, recently my power plug hasn't been recharging the MP3 player at all, unless I really fudge with it, and even then, it sometimes takes a while. I haven't done anything extreme with it, but the fact that it's become a ritual to recharge this thing when I used to simply be able to plug it in is really annoying me.I paid $170 for this. I should've just forked over an extra $130 or so and got like a 10GB Ipod instead. I would not recommend this product at all, unless you have money to burn."
1,Save Your Money,"I had this player for less than a month before it broke. It was a great player for about 3 weeks and then it failed to power on. I went on the Rio support pages and managed to get the player to turn on, only to be greeted with the dreaded ""Upgrader"" message. I installed the new firmware many, many times, but the player would never advance beyond the ""Restarting"" message. According to Rio's discussion boards, this happens to many other people, and it means that your hard drive is dead. Fortunately I was able to get a full refund, as it had been less than 30 days. Rio's warranty is only 90 days - I would be interested to see how many people actually had a functioning RioNitrus beyond 90 days."
1,Expensive paperweight,I bought this player for my wife to use while exercising. It started having problems after about 95 days (after the warranty was over). I upgraded the firmware and the unit completely died. Support quoted me $175 to fix the unit. That price is $20 more than I paid for it new! My old Archos Jukebox 20 has been going for over 3 years without a single problem. The Rio Nitrus is a piece of junk! Spend your money on an Archos or an IPod instead!
1,The day after the warantee ended....,"Well, it was actually more like a month, my Rio stopped communicating with my computer. After about 40 hours of first me troubleshooting, then going through both web technical services, and a telephone technical support person, I was told that since it was after the warantee, well, there was nothing they could do. So I have a slick, razor thin useless piece of euipment, and the option of shelling out $100 for a post warantee replacement. Yea, me!"
2,rio nitrus,"I bought the Rio Nitrus 6 months ago. I found that it wouldn't play for longer than 4 hours straight. Which if you had an outlet, and the charger wasn't much of a problem. There was alos a bit of a glare, and there was no pouch or anything to hold it in which made it difficult to keep track of. Then I dropped it about 2 feet, and it got really hot, made strange noises, and was stuck on one screen, finally transitioned to the off ""Saving settings"" screen, and stayed on that for ages. Then it played. And when trying to turn it on again, got stuck on the introduction ""Rio"" screen."
1,I would not buy another rio,"Frustration and disappointment.Its my first mp3 player. Within two weeks of purchase it malfunctions. Customer service poor at best. Their solution was to send me a remanufactured unit. It lost the ability to save new tracks. Another multiple week wait for another remanufactured unit, which by the way has again lost the ability to save new tracks, and also turns off on its own whim.I don't have the patience to deal with Rio anymore.Pay a little more and get an ipod"
2,Look elsewhere,"I got the Rio Nitrus for a Christmas present and I thought it would solve the problem of having to fumble through those annoying Cds and batteries; I was wrong. The Nitrus is very unreliable. It worked just fine for me the first week...and then, like icdrjjk said, it froze. i had to look on the support website to find out how to reset the thing, therefore deleting all of my music. It gets worse, then i could only download music to a certain memory point (983/1500 MB)when the Nitrus would then start to click and click...dislpaying an OPERATION TIMED OUT message. So then i need to call 3 costumer support people so they could OK me returning the defective Nitrus to the manufacturer. My suggestion is not to get this Rio...or a Rio at all. Stick with a reliable MP3 player like an Ipod."
1,Garbage,This product was one of the worst MP3 players on the market. I have this product and it went bad with in two weeks. I called there support and they were no help. They told me to hit the item in order for it work and you always have to upgrade the product. Upgrader keep coming on the players screen and didn't allow any of the functions to work. The online upgrade didn't help at all. I am disappointed in the Rio Nitrus. I was a good idea for a product but too many flaws in the item.
5,Love this product. I use it everyday.,"Sooo small and just enough space for my liking. For those who don't need 10+ gigs of music on the player, this is perfect. The battery life is almost 20 hours for me and the sound quality is awesome. They even give u great earphones, the MX300. The only thing its lacking is a case, but rumor is that its to come. Go get this small gadget, i'd say its better and more practical than the other 1.5 gb players cuz of its size, features, as well as price."
1,horrible,"I have been through three of these. It works for a few months then displays ""Upgrader"" on the display and will not restart. India tech support is useless."
3,Poor joystick design,"I had no problems with charging, battery endurance or transferring files. The player is big and clunky in comparison to others. The real problem is that the joystick protrudes from the unit face. Put the player in your pocket and the darned thing will keep shutting off due to accidentally pushing the joystick."
3,Rio Nitrus,"This is my second experience with a Rio product. I purchased another one of their MP3 players and it died less than 2 hours of working. I called Customer Service, but they said I needed to buy a new one. NO WARRANTY HELP! So I upgraded and got the Rio Nitrus. It was great at first. Although the software is slow, it is problem free. I have had some problems where it freezes, but the reset button takes care of that. The screen is not at all scratch resistant as I have multiple scratches and have been very careful with it. I have had the product about a year and the battery life is getting shorter. It used to get very good battery life, but now that is dwindling. However, it is still a good product. It is small, sleek, and holds enough music for me.I would have liked a case though."
1,90 Day Warranty,"My Rio Nitrus is 4 1/2 months old and I just learned that my Nitrus, which now beeps 7 times over and over before eventually getting to the dreaded ""UPGRADER"" message, is out of warranty.Technical support informed me that it is defective and needs to be replaced, but they will not replace it because it's out of warranty.My only Rio option is to pump another $100 into Rio for an ""out of warranty"" repair.I'm not going to waste any more money with Rio.A 3 month warranty on a $250+ player (bought in early October 2003) is way too short and something to think about if you are considering buying a Rio product.Go to the Rio website and see all the people who have had to replace these units. It's epidemic."
1,Another Victim of the Upgrader,"Yes, the design IS flawed, but not on a usability or conceptual level. The problem is, Rio picked a very bad hard drive to stick in this very sleek unit. Mine never worked. It never got past the Upgrader message, and I wasted time with Rio tech support (not an 800 number and outsourced to India -- so much for an American company) and finally demanded a refund. The FAQ about the Nitrus suggest hitting the unit to get it to work. Ask yourself if you want to pay about $200 for a MP3 player that you have to smack around to get it to work. If you really think you do, I strongly suggest you get a service plan along with the danged thing."
1,Add me to the list of DEAD RIO NITRUS,"150 days and the hard drive failed... click of death!! Andy at RIO support said ""1 in 100 HDs fail"" and offered to fix it for $125 (after 90 days you are out of warrentee!). Guess I'll look into ram drive players next, they don't have the HD technology perfected yet. Too bad Rio.Also the plastic over the screen is almost unreadable from scuffs."
1,do not buy....,"I bought this mp3 player for about 200.00 retail. Six months later, it no longer works. It stopped working again. I turned on the power, and the Rio splash-screen appears for about 60 seconds. It then starts making these weird clicking noises, displays the text ""upgrader"" on the screen and remains completely unresponsive any input. When I reset using a paperclip, it turns off, but powering it back on again yields the same results. The knowledge-base on RioAudio.com suggested that I upgrade the firmware, so I downloaded the latest and plugged in. My computer recognized the USB device, but the updater (RioNitrusFlash_123.exe) said that the operation timed out. Then I tried the same thing on a different computer, my laptop. Same result. I was advised by Rio Cust Support that the player can no longer be used if the firmware cannot be updated. Buy another product..."
1,One star is too high,I spent over $120.00 for this item. After 1 week it began clicking. After 1 month it died. I would never buy another Rio product again. It was difficult to program and interfase with my PC.Joe Bauza
1,50% of all units are faulty,"I work for a company in Clearwater, FL. We bought 4 Rio Nitrus - new in the box. Two of them had the notorius ""Uprader"" error within a few hours. That's 50% failure rate. That's unacceptable. I can only hope that Rio will have to pay the litigation piper! Have you seen the price on these things? Dear God! How many faulty units has Rio sold? How many millions has Rio pocketed by selling worthless players?"
1,Stay away,"I have really liked my Nitrus(now that I have one that works, after I had to return 2 that failed within days of owning)- it has been great for skiing, small and fits in the small zip pocket in my parka, everything works well---- ooopps!!! Was skiing for about 4 hours and the battery died. OK time to get a new battery- Rio emailed me to let me know the battery is not replaceable, and guess what--- Lith Ion batteries die- in 2-3 years and that's it. So no wonder all the reviews are of problems- the unit was designed to fail!! Planned obsolescence.It will probably last this season and then only work when plugged to the battery charger."
2,Did We All Get The Same Indian Lady?,"Like almost everyone else, I loved my Rio Nitrus with a passion UNTIL 35 days later ( 5 days too late for Best Buy to give a refund )when I reached the dreaded UPGRADER screen. This is where I stand now. I am trying to download the software upgrade since the firmware timed out and wouldnt load. If this doesnt work than the Indian Lady said to send it back and theyd replace it with a player that doesnt have my 365 songs and hours of invested time. For anyone looking for an mp3 player that wont break, THIS AINT IT."
3,An average value,"I bought this player a few days ago. After using it for a while now, there are several problems that began to surface. The biggest problem that I have encountered was with accessing the music. There's no way to browse songs on it except to go to the menus everytime!! This is so cumbersome it takes me so long to find a certain song. Rio needs to fix this with the next firmware release and also include an enqueue function."
2,Good while it worked,"I purchased a Rio Nitrus in the Summer of 2004. I filled it with about 300 songs from CDs and Napster. It met my needs, it was small, inexpensive and held just enough songs. Unfortunately, in March 2005 it stopped working. It was stuck in UPGRADER mode and after many weeks of failed e-mail assistance I called the support number. They told me that the player was broken (really? how about some reasoning) and that I could buy a factory-reconditioned unit for 75$. I was out of warranty and out of luck. I am considering upgrading to the 5GB Zen Micro or Rio Carbon, but I am hesitant to purchase further products from RIO."
1,Twice Failed,"After 2 months, RIO had to replace the Nitrus due to a hard drive failure. After taking almost 3 weeks dealing with Rio, finally it was replaced on April 8. Today the replaced unit failed exactly the same way. I now will try to get our $ back or have it replaced. I will never buy another Rio product. 2 failures and customer service was NO service.Time for an Ipod!"
4,schweeet little player,"Great DAP with decent sound and battery life. The gui is also easy to use, though not the best out there.. You pay for what you get, and in my case I couldnt be happier. There are no horror stories with upgrading the units to the latest rev. (you gotta wonder about some people.. duh..) Ive gone through a few already, couldnt of been easier. Rio makes great products that serve their purpose well. The only real gripe I have with this player is on ocassion it can take around 3-4 seconds for the next track to play. Other than that, highly recomended."
1,Defective Device,"First the battery would uncharge if the player had not been unused for more than 1 day. Second, the volume dial no longer worked. Notice that most of the bad reviews came after Christmas. I'm not sure if they manufactured a bad bunch or they new they were bad and shipped them anyway.The 90-day warranty is a huge risk and I will never buy anything from Rio again unless it has a better warranty. Also, they refused to refund my money because it was greater than 30 days when I called. You can get a replacement unit, but you have to call tech support first to get a ""RMA"". I currently have a request into Amazon to see if they will do anything.If they won't and you used a platinum credit card, try using the extra warranty to get your money back. Or you may be able to dispute the charges via your credit card. Good luck!"
1,"Good MP3 player, when it works","I bought this player about 6 months ago and have had a continuous stream of problems with it ever since. First, the player locked up on me, and they told me it was a software problem. I tried to install the new software on it, but that didn't work so they sent me a new one. A few weeks later, it did it again, except this time I was able to install the new software and get it working, but I had to go to all the trouble of putting my music back on it all over again (which takes a while). Now, once again, the player is not working, and the Rio software on the computer doesn't even recognize the player anymore, so I'm sending it back yet again.When it worked, it was great, but its not worth all the hassle. If I coul do it over again I would definitely NOT buy this player."
4,Good Player and Good Customer Service,I bought a Rio Nitrus about 3 months ago and it was great. I used it for 3 months and it stopped working and began displaying an upgrader message. After trying everything to make it work again I called Rio customer support and told them about the problem. They were very polite and after I told them everything I tried to do to fix it they told me it would no longer work and that they would have to send me a new one. By following their instructions I was sent a brand new Nitrus free of charge. Don't believe the reviews that say the customer support was horrible because it wasn't.
2,Not So Nitrus,"The programming of the Nitrus was very easy after I had created an account on the Rio website. I didn't like the fact that I had to stay current with Rio just to maintain the ""proper functionality"" of the device. Its not a computer, it's a jukebox! I was not impressed with the functions of the device as I would have expected better personal control over the it's functions, for the amount spent on this particular model. The menu was difficult to navigate and, again, should have flowed smoother for the $$ paid for the device. I do not think I would own another, and I am currently searching for a replacement that is easier to use."
2,Rio Nitrus,Some quick observations on this product now that mine has had a hard drive crash.1. This thing has a hard drive rather then flash memory. I only learned about its sensitivity after mine crashed. As the help desk told me (after the fact) don't use it for exercise or any thing else that could jostle it while playing.2. The display screen scratch's easily making even more difficult to read then it normally is.3. There is no back lighting on the display.4. If it goes out of warrenty they will repair (replace) for $100. I talked them down to $80 but am having second thoughts as to spending good money after bad. Does it really meet my requirements?5. The device is ok if you are a passive listener. We used ours on a month long trip to Costa Rica and really enjoyed it. I would not recomend the unit for anyone who might use it while they actually move.
5,Good Battery,"This battery outlasted my old one by a long time. I hardly have to worry about it dying. During our vacation when I was doing a lot of shooting every day, it got half uncharged every two days or so."
4,Great Product and Great Price,"Great Product and Great Price.Product got to me in a timely matter, in good condition, and charged without fail.Purchased two which are working in my Cannon."
1,False Advertising,"Do not order this item if you want a 1800mAh battery. What ""Accessory Genie"" sent me instead was a 1400mAh battery even though they charged me the same amount as the advertised 1800 mAh battery."
3,Pretty Decent for a Stock Pot,"For the most part you can't go wrong with a stainless steel stock pot. I got it for making beer, amongst other things, and it seemed to work out nicely. The included outdoor burner heat's nice and evenly if you keep it out of wind and it was really stable on my uneven lawn. The only real problem I had with it is where they did the engraving on the pot itself. There was this thin oily residue that looked like it was machine oil or cutting oil of some type. Definitely not something you want in your beer. It took about 4 hours of scrubbing with a brush and some dish soap, but I finally got it to where I felt safe brewing with the pot. Would have gotten five stars if the oil wasn't there."
3,"Ad does not match shipped specs, but still good...","The included hose and regulator were 10 PSI and 36"", NOT 20 PSI and 48"". Hose is stainless braided, good quality - just not as long as advertised. Regulator is stamped 10 PSI. Apart from that, the quality is good and produced a good shrimp boil after unpacking and cleaning. Heat was easy to regulate and the included thermometer helped me gauge the ""cold to boil time"" (20 min in 50 degree weather). For me this will double as a homebrew kettle. This stainless steel is durable enough for my uses. The paint will peel and smell a little the first couple of boils - this is to be expected and not a problem. This is a pretty good price for an ""all inclusive"" kit. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase. Not thrilled, not disappointed - satisfied. My first homebrew boil will probably help, though..."
4,pleased with turkey fryer kit,We have a large family get togeathers with this kit we can fix larger turkeys and not have to cook mult.
3,Hole in the pot???,"Opened the package today and set it up ready to get some water boiling. I noticed some water dripping on the back porch and thought it was from when I filled it up. I looked closer and noticed... water was dripping through a hole in the pot! I have NEVER seen a pot with a hole in it brand new. Also, one of the legs of the burner stand was off a bit. I'm giving it 3 stars because it seemed to be decent if it was properly manufactured. I have returned for an even exchange. Hopefully the next one is better!"
3,Where is the missing screw?,"I am a guy who can be easily be happy but little things can also make me unhappy. I was expecting this burner to arrive fully assembled. It was not. And worst, it did not come with the screw that will attach this burner to the stand. I wanted to use it upon arrival but I have to wait and see when I will have the time to go out and get this missing screw. Also you can not say this is a Bayou Classic since it has no sign nor sticker saying it is anywhere. Parts are all made in China. I cannot review this as of now because I did not use it yet."
2,Parts missing,The Batou Classic 9195 arrived without hose and regulator- useless without. Called they would not overnight so we could use it for Christmas guests. Has unique fittings that cannot be obtained elsewhere- very disappointed
2,Canon Compatible 9-pack BCI ink cartridges for Canon S750,"The color cartridges work beautifully. However, the black cartridges are not compatible with my Canon S750 and are completely useless. It will be necessary to purchase it from another source. Why they were sent with my order is a mystery. Canon S750 is not listed on the black cartridges as they are on all of the color cartridges."
2,Spoiled my printer,The black ink leaked and spoiled my printer. You really get what you pay for. I have to buy a new printer.
2,Off brand ink cartidiges - get what you pay for,"I thought I would give these ink cartridges a try for the price. In this case, I got what I paid for. The ink doesn't come out smoothly, and I don't get a great picture. If the printer sits idle for a few days, I need to run the cleaning routine to get the ink flowing. I gave it two stars because I still get to do basic printing, but I would not use it for anything deliverable. When these run out, I will return to the Canon brand."
2,Noteworthy: A Collection of Recipes from the Ravinia Festival,"At first thumb through this looks like a great cookbook. Upon closer review, however, it is about average. Nothing wonderful, nothing horrible. Good cooks probably already have much of what is included in this book."
2,Not her best; somewhat engaging; dissapointing ending,"I read this book while on a plane ride and it was engaging and a great companion. However, the ending was extremely disapointing. I imagined Ms. Rendell writing this book on a deadline from her publisher or something. Not her best work. However, been a fact that she is a Master at what she does, her worst still good enough."
3,A DISSAPOINTING END,"I'VE JUST FINISHED READING THIS BOOK AND I'M DISSAPOINTED WITH THE ENDING. MS. RENDELL IS TOO DESCRIPTIVE IN ALL OF HER BOOKS AND IN THIS ONE PARTICULARLY. MY VOCABULARY IS JUST NOT EXTENSIVE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, AND I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD ONE. HER AMATEUR PSYCHOLOGY IS SOMEWHAT TIRING. HER ENDINGS ARE A LITTLE TOO COMPLICATED WHEREAS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S ARE NOT EVER THIS COMPLICATED. IN SOME WAYS I THINK SHE TRIES TOO HARD AND HAS SOMETHING TO PROVE AND THAT IS TIRING. HER WORKING CLASS BACKGROUND COMES OUT VERY CLEARLY IN HER NOVELS AS THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO INVOLVE CLASS , MONEY AND EXCESSIVE DETAIL OF MATERIAL THINGS."
4,"Great Game, but CD must always be inserted ...","I don't normally leave a review but feel the need to WARN you about this CD. The CD is required to be inserted in your reader to play. If you don't mind the ongoing annoyance of CD ballet, buy this product, it is really outstanding. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,dangerous,This book spreads hate and intolerance- saying that Islam is an evil religion and that it along with Christianity should be eradicated. It also spreads intolerance about homosexuality.Show me the buddhist texts that say that. Lama Ole's centre support a lot of drinking and free loving.......but not much compassion. Steer clear!
1,the path to delusion.,"This is mostly a feel-good, fluffy book. The author heads a sect of Tibetan Buddhism (for lack of a better term) called ""Diamond Way"".The Diamond Way will not lead you to enlightenment, but to a Diamond Way center where you can purchase more of Lama Ole's books, work unpaid (volunteer) for the center, and visualize yourself becoming one with the 16th Karmapa (a dead, Tibetan man).Napping, flossing, daydreaming, and picking up trash near your closest highway are much better uses of one's time than any of Lama Ole's books."
4,cordless phone,no problems and work all over the house with no difficulty. very easy to setup and get going. we use it with three other handsets and the intercom feature is useful.
1,Don't waste your $$ - not even the $1.75 for a used copy!,"The funniest part of this book is that the author assumes he can condescend to his audience. To do that, he'd need to gain a bit of intelligence."
1,Do Not Buy !!,This is terrible! My friend was stupid enough to buy this book. I read his copy and hated it. These good reviews were written by Dan Wagner.
1,This book is NOT WORTH YOUR TIME!!!!,"Well, I am now positive that Dan Wagner himself wrote all of the reviews on this page, because the book is junk!!! If you want good reading, buy Private Parts and Miss America, not this trash!! (You can get those here at amazon.com cheaper than the bookstore)"
1,Approaching the Stern Show From a Stalker's Point of View,"The title above should've been the REAL title of this book. Dan Wagner is too self-congradulatory in his point-of-view in this book. Yes, he is an obsessed fan, but he's closer to a stalker. If you're a Stern show listener, the one star I gave this book is for you if you enjoy reading about some of the ""behind the scenes"" activities the author witnessed when he made an AWFUL appearance on the show. (Can anyone really recall the pathetic attempt made by a listener to give Howard an Emmy?) Overall, this book is a HUGE bore! It might be wiser to wait a decade or so, for a truely ""tell all"" book from someone who was really on the show. Not some wannabe"
2,another point,We all know what a wack-job this guy is from having read this book. How many of the positive reviews on this page do you think he's written?
5,Getting To Howard ROCKS!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. Very funny! I've listened to the Stern Show for many years and got a whole new appreciation for what goes on behind the scenes and for the people that interact with Stern. The photos were great too. I laughed my ass off at Dan's determination to give Howard an Emmy Award and the way he crashed Howard's Birthday Party. I didn't expect the book to be so well made. It's got a gold stamping under the bookcover of Howard (very artistic) and another gold stamping with the words ""F-Jackie!"" on the back. This is the perfect gift for any Stern Fan.This book is a must read for any journalist doing a story on Stern."
2,NOT BLIND COMPATIBLE,"The Mosby software is a Shockwave presentation. WindowEyes (current version) speech program will only recite the program name, NOTHING else.Only useless beeps can be heard.The QUESTIONS are all in italics. Some page scanners for the blind will not convert italics well or at all.The text is written on a high level, difficult reading for the average therapist or student with GED level English....However a lot of work was required to transcribe this book for a blind person. ..."
5,Mosby Review Guide,"Wow! What a wonderful concept by Mosby to finally have a study guide for the National Certification Exam. This book is unlike any other in the fact that it hits every possible question type that you could encounter while taking the exam. This book was great in the sense that it allowed me to see where I was lacking, so therefore I could check over the material that I was less adequate in. I liked the information given on the different question types such as factual recall, clinical reasoning ect... It helped me to understand how to pass the National Exam. Therefore I am happy to give this book an astounding rating because it is something that has assisted me through my career. Thank you!"
3,Book is better than cd,The book itself is far more helpful than the cd rom that comes with it.Study your meridians to be able to pass this exam because it is tough.
5,well organized format; packed with info,"I used this book (along with my school notes/ handouts) to review for the MBLEx. I particularly liked the glossary. If you don't understand a term and miss a question based on terminology, it is a good chance you need to review the concept the term describes. So it's a great guide to deeper study. You will still need to dig into your anatomy and pathology books. The strength of this guide is that it tests so many different areas so you can truly zero in on your weakness before sitting for any exam. Also, there are many labelling exercies, so you can see how strong you are on recognition of bones and muscles. I tried one other guide and a web-based review. This was by far the best."
2,This book is riddled with mistakes,"The Mosby's review book was highly recommended as a study guide to use as test prep for the NYS board exam by both teachers and prior students at the massage school I attended. So...as recommended to me, I have been using the Mosby's Massage Therapy Review book(This is a new edition) to prepare for my exam. I am shocked at the number of mistakes! These mistakes are not just typographical errors, but incorrect factual information. I am incredibly dissapointed in this book. It is almost if it never was proofread before it went to print!"
1,Overkill and Off-base,"Thank heavens I had and used another review book for the national exam (Ashton), and it was so closely in line with the actual exam questions! After working through only the first 3 chapters in Mosby's, my head was killing me because the questions were so wordy and complicated that I wondered how I made it through school with good grades. When the first question in the neuro chapter (chap. 4) asked about quantum physics, I knew Sandy Fritz had no business writing a review for this national exam! The exam was NOTHING like her format! The rationales for most of the answers gave no clear indication of why the correct answer was correct. I totally recommend the Ashton review book, and passed the national exam no thanks to Ms. Fritz."
1,Up set,"I brought book, never came email them about it they reorder it and charged me again. Not happen at all."
2,do not buy as ebook!,"I purchased this because of the practice exams that I believed would be included. The description advertises this book as coming with a cd that includes interactive practice exams in the same format as the actual boards. I figured that these exams would be included as extra content with the ebook; they aren't. Each chapter does have practice questions, but since they're not interactive, trying to use the book on an electronic device is pretty pointless; you have to write out paper copies; and I doubt if you can print any pages. You're better off geting a physical copy; as an ebook it is basically useless."
3,ASP tac mirror,"New in packaging ASP mirror. Works very well on the end of a baton (I have a Manadnock and it works the same). Quality is so so but worth the price paid. Disappointed it did not come with the pouch in the picture. I'll have to find a similar one now or risk scratching the mirror up in the shirt pocket. : Still very much a good product for room/ building clearance/ vehicle search and should accompany any ""bat-belt"". *side note should also look into a weapons light unless your clearing a well lit and open room (yeah right). Difficult to hold flashlight/baton and mirror/weapon."
3,"Great music, fun slapstick","Fans of Tim Moore will be disappointed to watch a wierd ""drag"" act drag on for over one hour - the great comic actor does alot of mugging, though his timing and occasional funny line helps out.The plot doesn't really matter - something about Moore (aka ""Lady Deborah"") doing his stage act so as to stall a entrepreneur/investor long enough for the real, wealthy, worldly woman to arrive to deliver 50% of the support of the new show, ""Rent Party"". (Should have been the movie title!).Movie appears to be filmed in Harlem in 1945 and this works, although there's a certain claustrophobia at play. A rooming house is the setting for the craziness, a real ""rent party"", with good jazz bands, great dancers, and a classical pianist, as the centerpiece.Gene Krupa makes a cameo."
1,SORRY!,"I must agree with the person who gave this pitiful film one star. Awful is putting it mildly. Yes, the dance scenes and singing were superb but as far as the overall acting and plot is concerned, the film is ""sorry"" to say the least. If you want to see vintage, Tim Moore, order the Amos'N'Andy DVD. Now that's great writing and acting! Tim (Kingfish) Moore and Spencer Williams (Andy) along with the rest of the cast (Saphire, Momma, Algonquin J. Calhoon esq, Amos, Lightin', Leroy, etc.)are excellent! You might also want to order ""Amos 'N' Andy: Anatomy of a Controversy"" to see just why the series was pulled from network TV!"
2,Best Player / Risky Hardware,"GOOD:This is the best player you can get - it's affordable, small, tons of features, cool dock, great battery life, and has some panache of not being an ipod.BAD:90 day warranty!Tons of hard drive failures. Mine failed at the 110 day mark. I hit it hard, really hard, and it worked again, but I'm now fighting with my credit card company to get money for a repair.If you buy this, you MUST get an extended warranty, or you'll be sorry.Take that as part of your purchase price, and getting an iriver or ipod might make more sense.There's no excuse for a $300 device to have a 90-day warranty and an exceptionally high rate of failure."
1,"Poor reliability , not being produced anymore.","I bought the rio 4 month ago,i handled it with care as if it was my only dear baby.but the first smallest hit , inside the bag, and the scrolling wheel doesn't function anymore.I called rio, they immediately knew this problem, they also confessed that this model was not a big success and is not being manufactured anymore.this player is very very fragile.Another major problem is the ""non storage"" driver, the rio can be used as external HD only after installing RIO TAXi."
1,Yet another hard drive failure,"I will add my own hard drive failure story to the numerous other reviews on this site since I just threw mine in the trash today. It happened, of course, after the 90 day waranty period, and I echo previous sentiment about poor/useless customer support. This product had a lot of potential and was great when it worked. I will steer clear of anything by Rio in the future. For anyone considering this product, look closely at all the reviews and note the hard drive failure trend--then look for another player."
1,"Buggy, tempermental and rude tech support","I couldn't stand the Karma. The first one I had froze up after only two months. Since it was still under warranty, the manufacturer sent me another. After about 8 months I started having problems with it again: it was tempermental about downloading music from my pc, it would freeze up, it took too long to switch from one album to another, and then eventually it just seized up and stopped playing. When I called tech support they said that my warranty had expired and tough luck. After two unsuccessful tries, and an unresponsive help line, my recommendation is for interested MP3 buyers to stay away from RIO."
1,Don't buy also had a hard drive failure,"Also had a HD failure after 5hr of use. Called Karma and they said too bad, that I could send it back with 230 bucks and they would fix it, some kind of stand behind your product company!!Anyway unless your willing to have an 300 buck paperweight like me an the other guy buy from a better company.Mine is going it the trash since I don't like to be reminded of getting ripped off."
1,Worst Mp3 Player ever,"I have this player, in the course of the last 8 months it has been broken 6 months. I had to have it replacecd twice and both replacements crashed irreparably as well. Customer service at Rio is a joke, they say they will call to rectify the problem but they never do, they don't even have an 800 number. At the end of the day don't buy this $300 paper weight"
1,what a dissapointment,"The soft ware wasn't as easy to use as I hoped. I was unable to find a random mode and playlists are tedious to create. you can't reorganize the order your songs play once you have created a playlist and it is boring to hear the samesongs in the same order everytime.Received the karma for Christmas stopped working the 1st week of May, that's right after about 4months of minnimal use. I have been quoted a $200 repair charge.This machine is too fragile for the price and considering the 90day limited warrenty, Rio must have know this when they put it on the market"
1,Buyer Beware,"My third Rio Karma in the last nine months has died. Similar to the previous two, a malfunction with the hard drive (each suffered a fate slightly different than the other). But, nonetheless, the player has locks up in start mode and refuses to initialize (it's a sickening and monotonous click and grind). I have become an expert at the various methods of resetting the player (resetting with paperclick, reinstalling firmware, etc.), to no avail this time. Three strikes and you're out. When this thing worked, I LOVED it, but I just can't deal with the poor track record and will never buy another. I have done a lot of research and understand I am not alone with these issues, so all I can simply say is BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. The warranty stinks and the unit's tendency to break is too great a hurdle to get over despite the great features. Now I'm looking at Creative's Zen Touch. Hopefully, I'll have better luck."
2,"When it worked, loved it, to bad that was for maybe a month","I bought this for my girlfriend and she used it for a trip. It was skipping from the start but that might be to the transfer. She used it a couple times at the gym on the bike and the drive was toast. We contacted Rio and the service there was beyond horrible. Their support has to be the worst I have ever dealt with. First got an e-mail saying to fax over the recipt and they'll ship a replacement out right then. 3 weeks later nothing came we sent a few more e-mails, never got a response. Finally called and spent a good 30 minutes on the phone. Got disconnect 3 times and each time I got back on the line with the same guy, had to go thru all the info again. 20 minutes into the call he said it was broke...no really. I would suggest to look elsewhere for a MP3 player."
4,Gooood little audio player,"I've lived with my Karma for two months now and love it. The RIO software is good and solid (although I wish Musicmatch's Jukebox supported Karma better), the Karma user interface is convenient and intuitive, the sound quality is high and there's_lots_of space for music. I've never come close to running out of battery.One key advantage is the large and readable display, suitable for aging eyes (mine).I_love_having my entire music collection with me anywhere I go.The only drawback that comes to mind is the slow download. USB 2.0 should run a lot faster than it does. 10GB takes about 5 hours to download.The RIO web site doesn't give an obvious way to order an extra power supply but if you call the toll-free number, they are available. Delivery takes a while but they do ship."
5,Best for mp3 enthusiasts.,"Had an archos jukebox recorder (modified to a 30gb harddrive) for about a year which i constantly updated with the alternative rockbox OS (www.rockbox.haxx.se). Rockbox made the experience much more enjoyable than the original archos firmware would. But, as the hardware began to wane in quality, i decided it was time to update to a new player. For Christmas I recieved the Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40gb. I enjoyed it's luxorious space for all my music, but abhorred its horrible transfer software and lackluster firmware... So, i returned it and recieved this little baby. My only qualms are that it doesn't fit all of my music and that it does not support drag and drop. Other than that I love the thing to death for reasons already expressed in other reviews (form factor, price, intuitive and quick firmware, sound quality). I believe i will be enjoying this thing for quite awhile!"
2,Failed after 6 months,"I liked everything about this unit except that, six months after I bought it, the headphone jack became intermittent. Tried cleaning, different headphones - no improvement. Rio charges close to $200 for trade-in swap for refurbished unit. So I was out of options. Bought a service contract next time, and went with an iPod, mainly because of the wider range of accessories available (got a combo charger and FM transmitter for my car that connected through the docking port)."
2,Rio Karma: Great...In theory,"The Rio Karma has some great features at a reasonable price point. However some of the features don't work (in my experience) and the firmware is very buggy. The only reason I have kept my Karma is because of the Ogg support. Otherwise I would trash it in a heartbeat. If you use Linux (yes, I know it is not supported) the only way you can communicate with the device is through the ethernet interface (no kernel support yet), and that doesn't work unless you use a x-over cable directly to your machine. Yuk."
1,Mine died within a month.,"It was fantastic while it lasted, but after less than four weeks of occasional use, my Rio Karma died without warning.This was with the latest firmware update.Caveat emptor -- before buying this player, I was warned that a large number of buyers have had longevity issues with the Karma.I will say that, when it's functional, it's definitely the best portable MP3 player available."
1,TOTAL CRAP,THE ABOVE REVIEWER HAD HARD DRIVE PROBLEMS. I DID TOO AFTER 6 MONTHSI CAN'T GET MINE REPLACED AFTER THE FLIMSY 90 DAY WARRANTY.THIS PLAYER WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME. GIMME AN IPOD.
2,Bum Karma,"I was really excited about the Rio Karma 20GB MP3 player until the HD failed after less than 24 hours' use. The recovery screen only says, ""Bad Karma,"" and ""Call Customer Support;"" however, I'm not sure I want to go through the process of upgrading/installing firmware (if even possible - nothing seems to work). Even with the features, great sound, and intuitive operations, I'm not sure I can rebuild trust in this HD to store my music after such a rocky start."
2,"Good for 2 years, then kaput","Well, the Rio Karma was everything I needed. Had moved all my music over to it and it would last hours and hours. Even took it over to England, lovely on the flight. Then just last week, it ""hiccuped"" while trying to load a couple more albums (no it did not run out of disk space. After that, it hung and wouldn't send nor receive anything from the Karma to the PC. Now, it is in a constant state of ""Communicating"", with absolutely nothing in that the PC software doesn't even recognize that the Karma is attached. The PC doesn't recognize the Karma as a device on the USB port.I only give it two stars, since it worked for 2 years. For the amount of money spent on this, it shouldn't have quit this soon. I'll be going to iPod and to hell with these other companies who just don't understand what quality means. Also, Apple isn't going to dry up and disappear."
1,Bad Karma,Seldom worked. Thrice replaced. Company's customer relations department played the telephone hold game while a supervisor was allegedly being located.Save yourself a long distance fortune and try a different MP3 product. Life will be less aggravating . . . or maybe I did something bad in a previous life.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER!!!!,I am very dissapointed with this player. I am now on my third player. I sent two back to Rio and I have no intention on sending a third.I was told not to go running with this player because the pounding can damage the hard drive. So I got this player specifically to use while travelling. Songs started to skip after three weeks of use and finally it got to the point where the hour glass stayed in a perpetual spin mode. I could not even shut the player down...had to wait till the battery ran out! For what I paid for this player....what a waste!!! Most likely I will end up throwing it out and purchase a player with a flash and no hard drive.
1,hard drive failure!!!!!,"dont buy this mp3 player, its not to great, i switched to an 1pod 20gb so much better its worth the extra few dollars go with the ipod. also the software is confusing and this dosnt support firewire:( go with the ipod and you will be happy"
2,UNRELIABLE PRODUCT! HARD DRIVE CRASHED.,"I got this RIO KARMA 15 days back, and it crashed today. This is a totally unreliable product, plagued by random reboots, automatic pauses, and other little bugs. When I tried to shut it down, it took forever to shutdown. I reset using the pin, then it just showed flash screen!!TOTALLY UNRELIABLE!!DONT TRUST RIO.GO FOR IPOD, INSTEAD."
1,Failed in 3 months,"My first karma failed within a few days of purchase. I returned it to the placeof purchase, and got a replacement. It worked for 3 1/2 months (just past the warranty) before I got a hard drive failure.It has a lot of neat features, but is in no way worth $100 a month."
1,Dont bother with Karma,"Bought one and it was dead in 2 months, got it back a month later, minus one month of warranty. Now the new ones only have a month warranty. Got to talk to India many times, couldn't understand most of it.Get an Ipod. Wish I did."
4,Great Product,"In mid-December 2003 I bought this player and used it a lot since then. First off I have to write that the included software is very easy to use. You want to rip your CD's into the player? Two mouse clicks will do so.I even installed and used the software on my parents old 333Mhz PII PC and had no trouble.I also brought the piece along to my Switzerland vacation, where I used in sub-zero enviroment while snowboarding. Neither the cold nor the shaking bothered the device and it worked fine as ever.The reason for 4 instead 5 stars is that the front gets scratched easily. My player is already full of small scratches. The whole player is very robust but the front plate is too soft if it celebrates a get together with your car keys in your pocket.Other than that no trouble and I am very happy that I bought it. I used it in the office, at home and in the car."
1,Don't buy this product,"I received this as a gift from my boyfriend two months ago. The reviews of this product touted a 15 hour battery-life, but I found that the battery drained even when the player was turned off. Customer support is horrible - I had to send three emails and make four phone calls before they would agree to allow me to send it back for a replacement. I just received the replacement (the same player, just with more scratches and a new battery, I guess) and now it does something new: it simply stops playing in the middle of a song, the screen freezes and you have to wait until it decides to be responsive again (30 minutes this time). Buying this product is looking more and more like a big waste of money and time."
1,On my second one now,The first one the hard drive crashed and the second one looks like it is about to do the same. I end up spending money shipping it back and lose the usage time. Horrible product that I bought through Amazon. Wish I had not done so.
1,Lasted just past the 90 day warranty,"I purchased this as a Christmas present. It stopped working the first week of March which meant it was several days past the ninety day warranty. RIO says ""past warranty - too bad"". So $300 down the drain."
1,Here we go again,"Usually I check out the customer reviews before I buy a product but unfortunately have no control over those buying me Christmas presents. Evidently looking over this section of Amazon.com, my father bought a Rio Karma for me and I was certainly excited to use it upon delivery. But within a week, the device froze for the first time. Before it was a month old, the Karma froze beyond user repair. I haven't contacted customer service yet, but I'm certainly worried having read many of these reviews."
2,Not ready for prime time,"The Karma looks great: small size, slick controls, gorgeous docking station. Lots of features. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its expectations. The ethernet connectivity feature doesn't work properly. After spending many hours trying with the help of tech support, the best they could come up with is a defective docking station. Maybe. I'm not going to try again. I suspect the problems go much deeper. The Music Manager software doesn't work well either. The manual and the help files are a joke. If you use the USB connection, maybe you'll do okay. The other reviews I've read seem to say ""NO""."
2,Hard drive broke,"I bought this on a saturday, and the following wednesday the hard drive broke. i called support and they pretty much confirmed that there was nothing that could be done, so i returned it. unfortunately, i had already put over 6GB of songs on it, so i wasted alot of time (as i wasn't able to get the songs off the karma).i did enjoy the product for the few days it functioned, however. the software was pretty easy to use, although it can't rip files as mp3 and it installs RealOne, which i didn't really want. it is a great size and the UI is so easy to use, i didn't have to take it out of my pocket to change the volume or start and stop it."
3,fat and chunky/hard to use at first,"for those who want style when it comes to mp3 players, this is definitely not for you. it is very fat and chunky and the black/silver outside is not as attractive as you might think. for those who dont care about that and just want more bang for your buck this is for you. 20g player for as low as 230 is very good...my first time using this i had a very very hard time figuring out what to do but i guess u catch on after a while"
1,This must be bad karma,"First, I highly suggest you live in the Contential US if you buy this product. The Rio customer service is good, but their services are limited. So, when your Rio locks up, the only place they will ship to is the USA.Within two weeks of purchasing this item, the drive froze. I was told that I could have it shipped to somewhere in the USA. Which, currently I am not in the USA. I was highly disappointed with this product. First, to freeze that quickly isnt a good sign. I am now looking for MP3 players with removable memory and removable batteries. This was an expensive lesson for me to learn. Hopefully, you do not make the same mistake.This product had great potential, decent price for MP3 players, but the problems with it freezing and options with this product are a big letdown."
2,Bad Karma,"I bought two of these for family members and gave them as Christmas gifts. One is already going back to Rio for an exchange. The hard drive died. There seems to be a unreasonably large number of people having this experience. Go to riovolution.com and you will see.I like the unit. I like its features. When it works it works well. The problem in my eyes is that they have a fairly significant failure rate and the warranty is only for 90 days.If you buy my advice is that you buy an extended warranty, otherwise stay away from this player. I am sorry to give such a rating on what otherwise is a nice machine."
2,Good player....when it works.,"I fell in love with this device for the first several months that I owned it. Like several of the people below, I am totally against the whole ipod thing, so I am a huge fan of anything that's not ipod. However, my Rio broke down THREE DAYS out of it's miserable 90 day warranty. I called them up anyway, but they wouldn't help me and tech support wasn't very friendly or quick. I managed to fix it, and it worked fine for the rest of the year, bringing it's total life up to one year, but it just broke again, and I can't fix it this time.The point of the story: this is a really nice device with good controls and a decent program included. The dock is magnificent and I wish other mp3 players would have similar. Don't buy it without the warranty!"
2,Wont last long,"I have purchased 2 Rios in the course of 2 years because they both BROKE. With all the rubbercasing you would think one drop on a rug would not kill the player. But it did. I had the RioNitrus and recently (3 months) purchased the Karma. They're now both in MP3 player hell. Ifyou want something that will last, Rio products are not the one."
2,No warranty..........Beware!!!,"When I bought this player, I was very happy with it for about 3 months, I ould put all my songs on it and it worked great. Then, one day the software crashed on the player, I called the customer service which is not a 1-800 number then tried to get something out of the person on the other line which most likely was in India. They had no idea of what to do and their only solution was to send back the player with $15 to get a new one!!! I should have bought a IPOD, at least they have a 3 years warranty. This player has a 90 days warranty!!! For something that expensive this is ridiculous!!!Save time and money, buy a IPOD!!!"
4,"Great player, needs more accessories","Like many people who plan to buy a DAP, I started out planning to buy an iPod. They look pretty good I guess, and there are plenty of accessories ( cases, remote, extra docks etc) but what I really didn't like was the limited number of formats that play on them. I personally like WMA and many of the legal online stores only support this format...so after searching around I found the Karma. It plays a wide variety of formats, has a great interface, great sound quality ( better than the iPod ) and great battery life. It kind of sucks you can't yet get a remote or a Karma specific case ( this is changing though ), but those are my only real complaints. Yeah there have been reports of some flaky harddrives and scroll wheels, but I haven't experienced any of that. One big bonus with the Karma is the price, far cheaper than a similar size iPod, even if you factor in an extended warranty. All in all, a great buy, if you take care of it."
1,Avoid the Karma,"If you buy this product, BUY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY!!!!!! Rio only warranties the product for 90 days. Mine waited until about 120 days to permanently fail. Rio's only solution is to sell you a refurbished product for around $160.00.Check out Rio's website for many more tales of unhappy customers. The forums have a thread dedicated to it.Save the extra money and get a new iPod. I bought one after the bad experience I had with Rio. I am pretty happy with it but would have preferred the Karma work as advertised.From what I cna tell you are better off if you just don't play the Karma while running/jogging etc. I just played mine in the car and it went south."
1,BEWARE OF RIO,"BEFORE YOU BUY ANYTHING FROM RIO, do your research -- I'm an adult who purchased 2 of their MP3 players to listen to while using the treadmill at the gym. Aside from the complaints that come with many electronic gadgets (eats batteries, controls difficult to use, etc.), BEWARE THAT THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ESPECIALLY UNHELPFUL. By checking online, you'll see that many individuals (myself included) have gone through numerous devices to find that the quality is poor, replacement or repair is grudgingly, if at all. LOOK AT ANOTHER BRAND BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY."
5,"NEW COMPANY, BETTER SUPPORT!","Just to clarify a few things. Any review of this product that complains about SonicBlue and Rio having a bad rep is invalid. Rio was recently bought by D&M, a much better company than SonicBlue was, and the Rio support has increased so significantly. Check out www.riovolution.com and the forum there; it will prove to you that the Rio guys listen to the customers and even make software changes to the products that they release according to the customers' requests! Five stars for support, 100 more stars (which wouldn't fit on the scale here) for the features of this product! It's simply amazing!"
4,Home Juke Box Player,"Rio does not advertize this product as a sport mp3 player. Anybody that jogs or bikes with a hard disk based player is just asking for trouble. What this unit is though is a fantastic substitute for your home audio cd player. Even more than a substitute, 20 gigs will hold just about anyones music collection. Sound reproduction is fantastic, especially with FLAC codec(which takes up more room than mp3/wma.). It is portable though to the car, the backyard or camping, just don't throw it off a cliff and expect it to recover. The screen is big and the menu system is by far the easiest I have used. The ripping/encoding software is easy to use and makes it's own data base that sorts and stores your music, but you may have to read the E-Manual included on the CD Rom."
4,Karma & Audiobooks,"I originally purchased an iPod in order to listen to my audiobooks. It was such a complicated thing that I got discouraged and returned it. I have had my Karma 2+ yrs now and I love it. I can bookmark my place and listen to something else, even have more than one book going at a time and still listen to music without losing my place. I love it! I have had some difficulties but they have always worked out. I hope if/when it needs replacing that I can find another one or something that performs as well and is as easy to use."
1,Horrible support,"The warranty is 90 days. I bought mine in December '03, and the power button stopped working in May.I called customer support, spoke to some nice people at an Indian call center who explained that my only option, because it was after the 90 day warranty period, was for me to buy a refurbished unit for $175. I decided not to sink more money into a company that has a 90 day warranty, will not perform out of warranty service, and does not have representatives of the company with whom I can speak.I'm certain that my problem can be fixed easily, but they won't do it. I really liked the Rio Karma, but I am going to buy something else. Rio will not get any more of my money."
2,Bad Karma,Got this player about a year ago and was very happy at first. I have had Rio players in the past but this one had all the features I wanted and it appeared to work very well. Right after the 90 day warranty is when it first locked up. I searched the internet and found that this is a very common problem and wished I had researched this unit before I bought it. Am VERY disappointed that it freezes up all the time but have learned to carry a paper clip with me to reset it. And for anyone interested I am NOT a fan of the Ipod. The Karma would be excellent if only it worked...
1,Poor Reliability X2,"Love the design but my hard drive failed 1 hour after I opened the box, it took months and many phone calls to get a beat up replacement. Customer service has poor communication skills and I had to go through several layers of supervisors to get results. Second device had it's hard drive fail as soon as the waranty expired. Now I'm out of luck, no help from RIO."
3,Great player -- if it works...,"After a few months my Karma started developing intermittent problems, requiring frequent resets and one or two reformats of the hard drive. After 10 months it gave out completely. Luckily I'd bought a product replacement plan. I bought an ipod with the refund.I like the ipod fine, but I liked the Karma better when it was working. Navigation was superior and the parametric equalizer was much better than the ipod presets. Karma's battery life is *much* better than the ipod's, even with the improvements for the ipod 4th generation.Karma deserves its reputation as the best designed hard drive mp3 player. It's a pity that hard drive malfunctions put a damper on things."
1,Crashed twice,"I received a Rio Karma for Xmas. I had it less then a week and the unit crashed. Hard drive failure. I call Tech support and after some time on the line they replaced it. I had my second player for 3 months and was using it only in the dock hook to my stereo and the hard drive crashed again. Hard Drive Failure again. I called Tech support and they said they were going to ship me another unit. I got the e-mail tracked it and was looking forward to it arriving BUT they shipped it to the wrong address. I called and they confirmed that they shipped it to the wrong address and said another one would be shipping, this was a week ago. I called today and it still has not shipped as yet. If you are looking to buy a Karma you may wish to bid on mine on e-bay because when the replacement arrives that is where it will be and I will put the funds towards an I-pod."
1,Other Reviews Must Be Insiders,Based on the positive reviews I purchase the Rio Karma. It is absolutely horrible. It is very big and heavy for a 20Gb MP3 player. Maybe 2X an iPOD.It skips very easily with very little motion. Absolutely can't be used during exercise.It locks up easily. The only way to reset is let the battery run out.Easily the worst electronics item I have purchased in the last 5 years.
3,Why is Shady Grove not available...,"Quicksilver is considered as a primary model for the SF sound and laying the foundation for the jam band scene which appears to be going strong. I enjoy this compilation and is great to hear lost songs such as Pride of Man. My favorite QMS albums are Happy Trails, one of the great live albums of any time period, and Shady Grove with the welcome addition of the great Nicky Hopkins to the SF scene."
4,Great Sound,"I think this was remastered well. The sound is very good.I agree with others that there were songs left out such as ""Mona"". I'd also like to see ""Happy Trails"" really re-mastered well."
3,flight simulator 2000 headache,"I'm still looking forward to using the pedals with Flight Simulator 2000. They look and feel perfect. The base stops them from moving anywhere they aren't supposed to. Once they get going I'm sure it will be like flying a real plane. However with FS 2000 they are automatically doing everything but the job they are supposed to.They control the throttle and the ailerons but not the rudder. I have turned off auto rudder and have tried to assign yaw to the pedals but in that option to assign you move the controller in the way you want it to be assigned and it auto detects the movement. Unfortunately, it doesn't detect a movement of the pedals in that option so I can't assign it. In spite of this anomaly if I test out the pedals they are working fine on 2 axes.In summary, you might need a computer boffin to configure it if you are using FS 2000."
5,"fold, staple, mutilate",Mechanically relentless. Surprisingly danceable. Buy it and get back to work.
2,Save your money...,"Check out Dave Hughes book on soft hackles and he made several positive positive references to this book. The amount of ""knowledge"" gleaned from this book could be covered in two chapters."
4,Coloma - Dovetail,"While Coloma's previous album, FINERY, was a fascinating blend of IDM and folk, their next, DOVETAIL, seems to lean more on the folk side of the equation. Gone are the glitchy touches or the occasional house beat; added are more ""organic"" instruments (like the horns that pop up on ""The Price of a Perfect Smile"" and other tracks throughout). And, while I appreciate the new direction, I also feel as if something's been lost as well. Indeed, the vocals seem to take a more central role here, rather than being an element. And while that's fine for neo-torch song like ""Talent For Leaving,"" it becomes a little brittle in tracks like ""Rainfall and Sirens."" Indeed, ""Happiness is Deafening"" edges towards synth-rock. By contrast, ""So Much In Common"" harkens back to the older Coloma--so even as you admire the qualities of this album, you keep thinking about their other album."
1,juggle - stick will malfunction,"The juggle will break after few mounths (bought two of them, on one the backward stopped working, on the second the play stopped working), otherwise it would have been a great mp3 player"
2,memory problem,"I bought this player 4 months back. I am having a serious problem for the past 1 month. Although the player has 128Mb of internal memory, I have been able to use only half of it, whenever I try to copy music files beyond 60 Mb I get ""copy"" error. I tried copying different files but even then I got the same error, then I reinstalled the software and the online updates. Even that didn't work. Now I am using it as a 64 Mb player. Unlike most of the MP3 players, it cannot be used as an USB drive. Average sound quality and good battery life."
2,It's alright.,"There are pros and cons to this little gadget.Pros1) Sound quality is excellent2) It's portableCons1) It sucks the life out of batteries very quickly, so unless you have rechargeables, don't get this.2) It might be portable, but you have to put it in your pocket. It's not very slim.3) It loses songs! ALL of them. The battery will just stop, the Rio will shut off and I'm unable to turn it back on. I'll pull out the battery, put it back in, and voila! The Rio will turn back on but no songs.4) Will not play WMA's.5) Uses software, which is quite annoying. Can't just download songs from anywhere.The Rio seems to be a decent mp3 player, but not the Fuse. Buy something else."
4,"Nice, cool, and made from Rio!","This player may not have FM radio, but it does have nice clarity, sleek design, and reliability knowing that it comes from the best, Rio. There is no way I'm ever owning a heavy, bulky cd player again.It holds about 2.5 cds at a time(30 songs)and comes with updated software, which is neat and easy to use. It has a great price and holds all the music you will need. The earphones are ""buds"" with 4/5 rating on comfort and clarity. Holds right in your pocket for on the go travel. It has a nice joystick, and seems will last a good while. And if you want to change the music,put it in the USB port and put more on! It's that easy. So if youre looking for an affordable Mp3 player, this is the one to get!"
5,This is a great little player,"this player is a wonderful little thing. weighing at 1.2 ounces (i'm not sure if this is with the battery or not) this is truly a player powerful for it's size. It includes a backlight, bookmarks, even a clock/date and stopwatch with laps, this is a remarkable buy for it's price. This also has a Taxi function, so you can transport files between computers. Another good thing is it's compatibility with PC's and Mac's, unlike many mp3 players that are only compatible with PC's.I only have two bad things to say about it : on some computers, you have to take out the keyboard plug to fit in the direct plug in. Two, sometimes it randomly turns off, but doesn't delete the songs or information, luckily. I hope this helps you make your decision. This is a great buy."
3,Could have been good,While the remake of Blondie's Tide is High is catchy and enjoyable. The whole album is too bland and safe. These young ladies have excellent harmonies and decent voices but they seem tentative and afraid to take risks hiding instead behind retreads of old songs. This CD could have been a lot of fun but my copy is most likely destined for the used store.
5,Pretty tone,"Wow, this cd is so awesome! Atomic Kitten has such great voices and all of their songs are pop attitude. Other than some other cds this is the best. From diffrent color hair styles to this there so pretty. I wish I could be like them."
3,It's OK!,"This CD would be good if it were less pop-oriented. The girls of Atomic Kitten have wonderful vocals, but the music is too sweet and isn't fast-paced enough."
5,AK are the best,"Atomic Kitten is by far the best pop group out there. I own their two previous cds which were released in the UK and they are the two best cds out of the 500 or so that I own. If I had to pick my three favorites on the album I would choose Walking On The Water, The Last Goodbye, and Eternal Flame but the rest of the cd is just as great. If I had to recommend one cd to buy this year this would be it."
4,A Nice Addition to a Science Collection,"This is a science picture book about different kinds of insects and their characteristics. Targeted for the preschool-kindergarten age, it introduces basic concepts to differentiate insects, bugs, arachnids, and other kinds of creatures. The artwork is unusual for a science book in that it is collage art rather than drawings or photographs; but it is colorful and interesting, a nice addition to any bug-loving child's library."
4,Great Book! A Must for any Real Estate professional,I read this book while studying for my real estate license. I learned a great deal about the business while reading this book. I'd recommend it even if someone wasn't into real estate. Ms. Corcoran is a great feminist role model!
5,great advice for all,"I really enjoyed this book.Practical, upbeat,encouraging. While I am in the healthcare field I learned many things that I was able put into practice in my own business. I really learned a lot and highly recommend this book. Susanna Thomas"
5,SO inspirational for a budding entrepreneur!,"All I can say is that I feel like I have a new, incredibly resourceful, entertaining, brilliant, unique friend named Barbara Corcoran that is willing to share not only her success story, but tips for anyone willing to learn and succeed. Wow, what a book! Barbara is such an incredible, successful person yet even at the very end, still attributes her success to the TEAM that she built in the Corcoran Group. She adds delightful stories going back to her childhood that probably only children from a larger family could relate to, but for me, coming from a large family myself it couldn't have been more appropriate. I happened to pick up this book at a time where I am myself trying to start a new business ( being in my 50's myself!) and little did I know that her roadmap to success would give me my necessary ""start button"". I have told everyone I know to read this book! I hope I get to meet her someday!"
4,Love this book,"It was one of my favorites, now my kids love it. I'm glad that Little Golden Books are still around, however dated the story may be. The artwork is fun and playful, the story silly, but it's very sweet. i'm glad it's still around."
3,Lion does not become a vegetarian,"My son and I are vegetarians so I thought this book would be great since it describes a lion who learns to love eating carrot stew more than eating bunnies. Unfortunately, they do add fish to the stew so that angle didn't work for us. Beyond that, the story is stilted. Much better choices are the Little Red Caboose and The Saggy Baggy Elephant."
5,Childhood memories,"Probably my favorite book as a child -at least, it is the one I remember most.Love the story and its outcome."
3,A cute classic,"This is a classic Little Golden Book, complete with the silly situation and cutesy but oddly satisfying resolution. It is definitely dated, but it is still somehow compelling.The writing, story, and illustrations are not anything special, and yet the whole seems greater than the sum of its parts."
4,Charming story,"Now, like many stories of that era featuring ""wild animals"", the geography is complete nonsense. Lions coexist with bears and kangaroos. Yes, this is annoying. How annoying probably has a direct relationship to whether or not your beloved Mama read you this book when you were little :) And, like many stories of that era, the biology is also a bit skewed - Lions who eat carrot and fish stew will not be happy and plump, they will be even scrawnier because lions are obligate carnivores. Eating meat isn't something they do to be mean, it's something they do because they have no choice.So, you know, if you're looking for realism, this is not the book for you.If you're looking for a cute little story about how friendship tames wild beasts and makes everybody happy... well! This one is great. It's a bit wordy, so consider your audience."
4,Good,"Like a new book, there is no any written notes or highlights in this book and the price is reasonable"
2,Beautifully presented BUT..........,"... a substantial chunk of Mathers' invaluable notes is missing. I have written to the publishers who did not bother to reply. As the notes help the reader to understand a difficult text, this is a serious (and careless!) error. The notes to the final two-thirds of the book are printed."
5,the best military history of the Civil War,"Hattaway and Jones have written the best military history of the Civil War, one that makes many other studies, including ones published ater HOW THE NORTH WON appeared, outdated. Those interested only in ""gun & trumpet"" history instead of real military history should be warned, however, that Hattaway and Jones properly devote time to crucial issues such as logistics, organization, and administration--this is not simply a ""battle narrative"" of the war but sound and provocative military analysis."
5,Outstanding history on the strategy of the Civil War,"I've read many Civil War history books. Most focus on the battles and the people involved, which is understandable since those are some of the most interesting aspects. This book focuses on the over-arching strategies used by the North and South, how those strategies were set, who set them, and the results and battles that followed. It's very well written and a very interesting read."
5,Still a must read,Even though this is more than 20 years old it is still a must read for any serious student of the Civil War
2,Whoopty-do.,"Dr. Hattaway does an amazing job of taking an over-studied aspect of American history (the four years during which the Civil war took place) and manages to...talk even more! Another one of those un-critical historical works that chooses to act mostly as a chronology and focuses on the un-interesting aspects of the civil war, such as military strategy and the boring lives of the leaders. Please, please, please, our universities are jam-packed with obsessive civil war historians!"
2,its an okay cd,Well...this cd is okay...not one of my best Kenny Rogers cd...but its okay....at least it his voice so that is what is count.....Thanx and cheerz from Bina in SWE;O)nov 5th 2007 at 2.02pm*
5,The Blind Side,"The DVD arrived prior to the date I expected it and it seems to be in good condition, although I have not played it yet."
1,Does well-meaning sentiment now equate with quality?,"Never before has such utter mediocrity grouped with just plain old fashion bad storytelling and ham-fisted acting received so much praise and attention. That this was actually ""honored"" with a Best Picture nomination from AMPAS is beyond laughable. Indeed, I subsequently disregarded anything to do with the Oscars and specifically because of the populist influence in their awards process which led to this pablum being part of the ceremonies."
1,Bad DVD,Most likely will not purchase anymore DVD's asthis one skipped thru the whole movie and cannot be returned after it was opened. How doesone know if the movie is bad if you don't openit?????????
3,You can watch it once,"Sandra Bullock looked different as a blonde and she was a kind of interesting character the way she takes charge and does things. But the story was unbelievable. Too lacking in realism. I like fairytale endings and I like feel-good, but things happen too predictably and easily here. I have the movie lying at home but haven't felt like watching it again."
1,This movie is bad,"This is a white-friendly, feel good film that will bore you unless you're a football addict. And even then you may wonder why it came up on the Academy Award radar screen at all. Except that Bullock is a big money-maker and it serves the industry to praise her. She hits one note in this film and keeps hitting that note. Again and again she hits that one single note, and when you've had enough she hits it some more. Pretty soon she's SO boring. Ultimately she just wears you down. Help! A goose with a good, strong honk could have played that role. I suppose it's sort of fun to watch rich, privileged white people successfully bulldoze their way to the head of the line while poor non-whites have to wait their turn. Oh yes, and we're clearly supposed to rejoice that Bullock's character patronizes a big needy black person, and is short tempered with her racist Republican luncheon companions."
4,Simply Inspirational!,"One of the most uplifting/inspirational movies that I have ever seen. The acting could have been better, but altogether a very good movie."
5,The Blind Side,This is a truly enjoyable and thoughtful story with the actors a wonderful fit. I've watched it over and enjoyed it as much the second time.
5,Excellent transaction,"This was an excellent transaction. The product was in new condition, as promised. The delivery was quick. I expreienced no hiccups throughout the transaction. Thanks. I very much appreciate that."
4,Piligirl,"It came quickly and I have seen the movie. It has a good quality and I am glad I purchased it, for not very much money."
5,The Blind Side,Great movie with a fabulous cast. Sandra Bullock rocks! I had to have the movie even though I saw it in the theatre.
5,Sara's Review,"Excellent Movie! One of the best I have seen. I purchased this dvd online at an awesome price, and received it in the mail quickly. Overall, I was pleased with both the movie and the service I received on Amazon."
4,great deal - slight cosmetic damage,"I got this for 4 dollars over black friday. It was backordered, so it took 6 days to ship and then I got it two days later since I have amazon prime. The paper cover was slight torn on the inside or the plastic. This was purely cosmetic, but also somewhat disconcerting, since I don't know what could have caused it. Otherwise it is a great movie for an unbelievable price."
5,My All-Time favorite movie,"The Blind Side is now my all-time favorite movie!!! I laughed & cried all the way through this movie!! As an educator, it was tough for me to watch how the teachers treated Michael. He only needed someone to care...and the Tuohys gave Micheal the love & care he needed. Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw do fabulous acting..you almost have to remind yourself that they are the actors. They portrayed their parts in an amazing & talented way!!! I LOVED this film!!"
5,A Blockbuster,What a wonderful video. Sandra Bullock is great. The film gives us a story that many lessons can be learned from. Good film for young people.
5,Great Movie,We bought this movie for our daughter for Christmas because she'd never seen it.This is a really great movie and wonderful for the entire family. I have nothing but praise for this movie and I would highly recommend it!
5,The Blind Side,"Great movie. Inspirational. Once in a great while Hollywood gets one right and this is one of those times. Pretty hard to screw up a true story. Looking for sex, drugs, guns, explosions, fast cars, vulgar language? Then this movie is definitely not for you."
5,Great story. My 7 y/o son loved it. Whole family loved it.,"Great family sport movie. 7 year old son loved it (football fan) and myself, wife, and teenage daughters also loved it."
5,Great Family movie,"Great clean family movie, I would highly recomend for anyone. I give it five stars because I think anyone could watch it and get something out of it."
5,Good Hearted People Still Exist!!!,EXCELLENT Movie!! just goes to show that there are Still Some Good Hearted People in the World!! Not Everyone Would Do what Leann and her Family did For Michael.The way Sandra Bullock portrayed her role IMHO....I Think She NAILED IT!!!
4,Great Family Movie,Great gift for my girlfriends daughter. They had this movie on their DVR but lost it when they switched cable companies. great price on a good movie
4,A very good movie. It showed what a little love can do for someone.,This was a very good movie. It shows what a little love can do for someone who has had a rought time in life.
3,Movie review,"I believe this is the movie I paid and rented, but did not actually find the time to watch, so I can't give you a realistic review"
1,Poor Quality DVD,Delivery was fast. When I played the movie the quality was very poor and led me to believe it may have been a copy pirated. Two-thirds way through the movie it glitched every three minutes until I finally gave up. I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD.I had saved the original box my DVDs came in and sent the movie back to Amazon in it's original shipping box with a note inserted in the DVD case explaining the poor quality. Amazon was very quick to give me a complete refund and a refund of my shipping costs. Amazon handled the matter very well and I prefer buying from Amazon over eBay now.
5,The Blind Side,This gives hope to people who are handicapped in some what to keep trying and not to give up but continue to try to reach their goals.
5,Wonderful Movie.,"This is a great family movie, one everyone can watch. It is full of life lessons and will become a classic some day."
4,Very good movie.,Highly entertaining.Very good story based on a true story.Very well made movie.Downloaded a rental from amazon and watched thru my computer.Excellent picture and no interruptions.Strongly recommend.
5,very moving movie..loved it,"I loved this movie, probably because it is a true story, and so heartwarming..so refeshing..it is one I will watch over and over again.."
4,very happy,"sorry ,this will b short ,because i knew what i was getting b 4 i purchased this product.happy 4 what i got ,because i own it now 4 myself,thx u."
4,Love this movie...,"A feel good sports movie. Not totally authentic, but I love the quirky characters and the cameos by actual college coaches. I will watch it several times a year!"
3,The Blind Side,Have been in contact with seller and have no negative comments as I feel she has been fair to work with.
3,CD quality disappointing,"I was so looking forward to viewing this movie as life was hectic when it came out at the theater and I missed it. I was not disappointed in the movie, but the CD I purchased had several jump spots in it and a really bad place with no sound at all. It was rather distracting to view."
3,Pleasent film. Can't complain.,"Good movie, but best actress? Every other role must have sucked on 2009. She was good, but the best, very unlikely. The Movie was good and entertaining. i think Sandra had a better role in Demolition Man, lol. O well, good for her."
4,fun to watch,"This is an emotionally charged story, but it isn't sappy. This is much better than I thought it would be."
5,Michael Lewis and Sandra Bullock Team Up,"Michael Lewis is my favorite writer. I have read all his books from Liar's Poker in 1989 to The New New Thing in 2000 to Moneyball in 2003, The Blind Side in 2006 and Panic in 2008.I have seen many of Sandra Bullock's movies, including her breakthrough film Speed in 1994 and Crash in 2006. Her acting in the 2009 film The Blind Side is the best of her career and she was rightly awarded a 2010 Oscar as Best Actress.This is only the fourth film that John Lee Hancock has directed. He avoids all the cliches that could have sunk this movie by being faithful to a real life portrayal of the leading characters.Don't miss the special features found in the blu-ray edition, which are some of the best I have seen."
4,4 star movie,"Amazon delivered movie to myself , an a friend from another state , as usual it was delivered on time an a very good movie . thanks again Amazom for being prompt . You make shopping online easy . MARK A PISARZ"
3,the blind side,It was OK bbbbbbbbbb bbbbbbbbbbbbb bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbnnhhyhhy. This requirement of number of words sucks!This is the last reviewI will ever do!
1,Trash.,"The pile-on of big emotional moments, accompanied by big music, is overwhelming. This is a movie demanding to be loved."
1,"Real life is, apparently, a formulaic Hollywood movie",Everyone is great. People are great. And predictable. What a beautiful predictable Real-Life story. This is NOT a story adapted and over-sentimentalized by a Hollywood hack. Wonderful.
2,racist . judgemental fantasy,"""Who'd have thought we'd have a black son before we knew a democrat? ""This line speaks volumes about the creators of this movie, so basically a black person is automatically a democrat, without volition on his own. Plus noting that Tennessee where 41% voted for Obama is where this movie takes place . This is just a white guilt, movie who all the ignorant white people who want to fall this. It insults black , white, and all others affect by suppression in a condescending manner. I wonder if people noticed the slaves in Spartacus, or the fact that Russia ended slavery only 2 weeks earlier then the US. If you worship hollywood then this is for you. Really if you going to liberal guilt, then this is for you. Its a total fantasy for those yearning for ignorance of history, and people who are black or white. Its a stereotype dream!"
4,The Blind Side,"This film, based on the life of Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman Michael Oher, is populated by strong, well-acted characters. The football scenes are reasonably believable, as are the interactions between Mr. Oher and his adoptive family. The movie nicely displays the development of trust and love between the characters, and the script provides Ms. Bullock an opportunity to portray one of the strongest ""southern lady"" parts in film.A feel-good family film."
5,Great Flick,"Enjoyed the acting by everyone - the story line is very touching, filled with the best of humanity! Highly recommended!"
5,Very Good!,This movie is one of the BEST! Sandra Bullock and the entire cast did a wonderful job putting together this true story of success!! Can't wait to see each actor and actress in their next film!Two Thumbs up Great Movie!!
5,Another two thumbs up from our house!,"Our family loves this movie, and for a family of parents and teens to all like the same movie can be rare. We like Sandra Bullock in almost anything, so we did not analyze this story line and what parts were believable/true, etc.The ""feel-good-ness"" of the movie comes from:* seeing people doing something daring and rare,* seeing, as another reviewer stated, the power of mentors,* seeing love in action with no strings attached,* seeing a John Doe nobody become something greatI felt like paying it forward more often after I watched this...inspired into action."
5,One of the best movies out,"You don't get many movies these days that are really good, no sex, no cursing, and no violence. It's a true story to boot! What a great family movie and so heart warming. Even my college son loved it."
5,A fantastic movie,"I first saw this movie in cinema and i really loved the movie, Sandra Bullocks performance is outstanding, she deserved the oscar! More amazing is that this story is a true story and i loved the fact of a rich family taking a poor boy in and help him out and even adopt him. It proves us that eventhough people might be poor, they can be helped by the rich. Of course people gotta earn trust and that's what Michael Oher did, he earned the trust from the family.I would watch this movie over and over again, that's why i had to buy this dvd as well..."
4,Successful By Encouging Someone,"I feel this movie would be encourgeing to a teen age person, that regardless of how they were raised that they can succeed with a strong will person encourageing them. It was a very warm story, infact a true story. Ones past is held in the back of the mind but, does not rule their future to succeed.His foster mother, later mother, knew that he could succeed. I was pleased with the movie, infact I'll watch it again."
5,Great movie,"I loved this movie in the theater so when I saw the great deal Amazon was offering on the DVD, I had to buy it! Very quick shipping and in perfect condition."
5,The Blond side- a must see for all,"The Blindside is a movie everyone should see. You see a family giving. You see a young man who overcomes horrible circumstances. If you are NOT inspired, take a gut check. Great true story."
4,A movie of mutual acceptance and love,"I found after reading the book and also reading Michael Oher's ""I Beat the Odds"" that I saw many ""short cuts"" and the use of ""literary freedom"" that dimmed my acceptance of the movie, but liked the movie in spite of them."
4,So heartfelt.,"If you have a soul in you then this movie should be able to stir it. Starring a 17-year old black kid that's in and out of foster homes who's never really given a chance, a very considerate white woman comes into his life and changes it completely. She (Sandra Bullock) gives him a new chance at life with her family and he starts to turn things around...It's about 25% football and 75% emotion.A good watch that sorta drags towards the end.Nice for the older bulk of the family to enjoy. Has some language and brief drug use towards the end of the movie.4.25 stars."
4,Blind side,"Great movie, filled with hope for those who may not have any. I just wish it stuck to the real life story a bit more."
5,Great movie,"Excellent in all respects, this movie is Sandra Bullocks best so far!! This story inspires all to look out for the champions yet to be discovered."
3,Would have gotten 5 stars but...,"Great story! Of course it's Hollywood's version of a true story, so you can already expect that it's not 100% accurate. It was an encouraging movie. I would have given it 5 stars, but SJ's character (son of the Tuhoy's) was so annoying I decided to never watch the movie again. Even though he was only one character, he had the same effect of fingernails on a chalkboard throughout the movie. They tried to portray him as funny, cute, smart, adorable and a sports fan, but he just turned out to be obnoxious. If this was really how he was in real life, kudos to Micheal for living with it!"
5,well-done and directed,"Great understated performances, portraying normal people in believable ways. It was also refreshing to see conscientious religious people portrayed in the normal way they live their lives, which is not how Hollywood portrays religion typically these days."
3,blindside aside,"I love the movie the first time I saw it , but the DVD was a little fuzzy but otherwise it was what I expected"
4,Heartwarming,I love watching this movie over and over. It is heartwarming and well acted! I recommend this movie for people of all ages.
4,Welcome to the land of privelege,"Well made, well performed movie about how great it is to unexpectedly join the privileged classes. Apparent sarcasm aside, even looking at it with eyes wide open, it is a good movie."
3,Should be better!,"What has happened to all of the great film producers and directors? We can rave about a film that was except for Sandra Bullock just alright. Even though this was taken from a real story, I felt the story lacked content. We should put our foot down and demand more from them. As much as movies cost, I feel they are just cranking out garbage; no content and alot of action. Come on, we deserve better."
5,good movie,The packaging was neat; movie was good; and humor was fun. I love the acting and chemistry; works well for Sandra Bullock
5,Fabulous Movie,"We've enjoy a good movie now and then, and this is definitely the best movie we've seen in a long time. The characters are amazing, the plot is interesting and moving. Definitely worth the purchase!"
2,The Blind Side CD,"I absolutely loved the movie when viewing it at the theatre, however upon viewing my copy I recently purchased, it appeared to be a bad copy. The first 40 mins or so of the video is extremely dark.... I was unhappy with the quality."
2,all hype,"The best thing in this movie is Sandra Bullock.. and it wasn't for her acting. The movie was predictable, simple, not particularly believable (I know it's based on a true story), and Michael Oher is likely a little embarassed by how the writers/director decided to portray him in this movie.I can't take away from the true story which I am deeply encouraged by. Remember that Hollywood is extremely biased. The people who rate movies and hand out awards are all hand-selected old rich liberals from CA, far off from mainstream."
2,How patronising can Sandra Bullock be ?,"Rich republican is nice to sad poor black guy , who wouldnt you know it is great at sport . the movie is patronising and just a bit racist."
5,Sandra Bullock's Surprising Performance,"I have always been a fan of romantic comedies where you can see the happy ending from the beginning. Therefore, I'm a pretty big fan of Sandra Bullock because the genre that she usually goes with is romantic comedy.I was shocked by her performance in The Blind Side. She was so believeable as a rich white southern woman that took in a homeless black teenager with no questions asked. After the movie was over, I remembered thinking ""She deserves an Oscar for this performance"". That premonition came true tonight. She really earned it.This is one of my new favorite movies. I will definitly be buying this as soon as possible. If you haven't seen The Blind Side, you really should. It is so good to know that people like the characters portrayed in this movie actually exist."
5,Reaching Out,"This is an awesome movie about what we should all do everyday...Reach out and touch someone, make a difference, go the extra mile, take a chance, take a risk, give your whole self, love on others, show someone that God loves them... Terrific story."
4,Great movie,More about life and love than it is about football. I really was touched by this movie and loved that it was a true story! Some people really rock.
5,Awesome,Julia Roberts was awesome... True sorry also... Love it...would watch over and over... Good for whole family... Great actors also
5,Blind Side,Sent this movie to my grandchildren. They enjoyed it very much. Would recommend to families with children.
4,"Enjoyable Movie, But the Side Story Seems to Have Gotten Lost","No doubt that this movie was Hollywood-ized. The young son was a totally unbelievable character. Sandra Bullock gave an outstanding, touching performance and I can't argue w/ her Oscar.I actually found the story arc to be disturbing. It simply doesn't ring true that an upscale white family in the south takes in a black kid from the other side of the tracks. As the movie progresses, we find out that the family are rabid Ole Miss boosters. Coincidentally :), Michael Oher is a gigantic monster of an offensive tackle, heavily recruited by major college programs. Where does Oher end up going to school? Surprise, surprise, it's Mississippi! In fairness, the NCAA investigation of impropriety is disclosed, but I still remain highly skeptical of motive."
3,A good one to watch with your girl,"Here it is guys, a football movie that you can watch with your lady friends. Tell them it's a heartwarming rags to riches journey of an inner city youth. Don't show any emotion at watching LT's hit on Theisman in the opening sequence, and they'll be pulled in."
4,Great Movie,Excellent story line and because it was a true story it warms your heart even more. This movie also shows how love goes across racial lines and makes family family.
4,"MKanning, Alabama","The screen writer had no business adding the simulated sex scenes even though it was husband and wife... such was not relevant to this wonderful story, and was embarrassing as a family movie, as was a small bit of the language.If these two things had not been added, I would have given it 5 stars.--"
2,Another sports story cliche?,"This story had all the elements of a fine sports story cliche - rich vs. poor, black vs. white, etc etc... Has anyone heard of Radio, Rudy, etc etc....In this age of bad-movie making, poor directors, the lowest common denominator, is it any surprise that this movie got so many raves. This had too much syrup and too little reality. And what did Sandra Bullock do to earn an Oscar? Not sure. Didn't seem like such a tough part, except how humorous was it to see her in the hood with that skimpy dress. Real believable.And the little brother was annoyingly cute."
4,Heartwarming,"Whenever a movie is ""based on"" a true story, there's always the question of how much truth we're actually seeing. In the case of this movie, based on the comments of others, we're indeed seeing mostly truth. And, put simply, that truth is heartwarming (I won't get into the details, since many people have already described the story, which is straightforward).While there have always been ample events in the world to foster pessimism and cynicism, this movie reminds us that there's also genuine goodness in at least some people's hearts, and that goodness can transcend barriers to make a meaningful difference.Highly recommend to anyone looking for a feel-good movie."
5,"Have always been a Sandra fan, but...","This film shows a whole other side to her acting!!The story is wonderful, the supporting cast is great and it's just so nice to see Sandra shine is family film that shows off her talent!The DVD itself is fine. No amazing extras, but that doesn't matter. The real star of the DVD is the film itself!"
5,Awesome movie!,A real family movie that isn't sappy. I'm a BIG Sandra Bullock fan and she really shines in this flick!
5,Great Moral,The best movie I've seen in a long time; it really shows you that if you have the means and you're not stuck on yourself you can do great things to open up doors for the less fortunate.
5,BluRay DVD,Outstanding movie. 10 times better than Academy Award winner 'Hurt Locker'; 8 times better than 'Avatar'. Actually has a plot.
5,The Blind Side,"I bought this movie for my daughter for her birthday. I really didn't think I wanted to watch it, I thought ""Oh boy, a football movie"". I do not care for football! My daughter convinced me to watch it. All I can say is ""WOW"". This movie is GREAT. I would give it many more than 5 stars if I could. I just may be buying this for my own movie library!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of the best movies of 2010!,"Great movie. Glad I bought it for 4.99. I actually intended this to be a gift for my girlfriend, but I chose to buy it for myself at the last moment. Thanks amazon!"
5,great movie,"First of all, Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actors. She makes all movies she's in awesome. This movie is touching and great for the whole family. I recommend this movie to all."
4,I liked it,"Let me start by saying that Sandra Bullock was great - finally a perfect role for her. The story was also enjoyable enough, telling how a supersize teen finally gets a lucky break in his life and finds someone who really cares about him. The fact that it's based on a true story only makes it better. You definitely need to be a football person to enjoy the movie though, since they eat, drink, and breathe it."
5,"Refreshing, Great Story Line, Very Talented Actors","I saw this movie at the theater & have been waiting for it to come out on DVD so I could buy it. Not since The Bucket List & Second Hand Lions have I enjoyed a movie this much. In my opinion it was Sandra Bullock at her best alongside all of the other very talented actors in this movie. As much as I love football, the morals & the storyline were what made me enjoy this movie so much. This is one to watch & enjoy over & over again!"
5,Great,Very moving and compelling given it's a true story. I definitely recommend it for a feel Good Friday or Saturday night movie at home with your partner.
5,Awesome movie!!,I've seen this movie several times and I still think it's great. You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy it. My wife knows nothing about football and she loved it.
4,Good but.......,I really liked the movie. My only gripe was it took to long to download and therefore had a short time to watch. I did receive this as a warning but seriously took too long to download to my tivo.
5,Best Movie in a couple of decades,"I'm picky about which movies I give 5 stars to. This movie deserves them all. Well written, well acted. Probably Sandra Bullock's best acting I've ever seen. I absolutely love this movie and watch it over and over."
4,travel alert,Chronology vis a vis location jumbled at times but experiences shared assisted in narrowing personal plans for my future. Reading Theroux's perspective is amusingWonder how I would view it? It helps that he had his own reputation on which to trade in gaining entrÃ©e to some of the mote engaging expats
1,Hated it,"I couldn't get past the first 100 pages. Is this guy actually going to whine and complain and sneer the entire way around the Mediterranean, and is anybody interested in reading that? He starts with a loathsome description of Gibraltar and his fellow tourists and the poor monkeys. Continuing along the coast of Spain, every place he goes, every person he meets, is despicable. I was particularly nauseated by the repeated gory descriptions of bull-fighting. OK, OK, once was enough, in fact, once was more than enough. There is a popular expression, ""words cannot describe"" how awful something is. Well, this guy doesn't suffer from an inability to find the words. He finds every word he needs to describe his miserable journey."
1,A Tour of Narcissism,"I've read a lot of armchair travel books, and I enjoyed Eastern Star, and expected much the same, but instead I wallowed in Theroux's angst,philias, phobias, id, libido and ego until the middle of Sicily and trashed the thing. You won't get much Mediterranean, you'll get Theroux. It could be worse, I was reading, anything like a conversation would have been unbearable."
1,The bigoted traveler,"I read this book cover to cover, so that I could just allow myself to write this review. Traveling is meant to widen one's understanding of the world. Travel-writing is meant to share and contextualize these experiences for the reader. The author fails on both accounts. Despite (or perhaps because of) the luxurious mode of his traveling, he does not seem to enjoy himself. He lacks empathy for the people he meets and the countries in which he travels. Moreover, he has not done his homework when it comes to the histories of these peoples. Characterizing him as insular, scornful and arrogant would be too kind for Mr. Theroux. He is an unabashed bigot."
2,Pilllars of Hercules,"In August my husband, and I are re-visiting the area mentioned in this book. The historical background included in this journal is most helpful to us amature history buff."
3,a good writer and a lousy traveler,"I must admit I enjoy reading Theroux for his verbal wit, astute observations and linguistic acrobatics. As a traveler, however, the man is a complete failure. In a sense, he doesn't really travel at all:He surrounds himself with a bubble of his arrogant American expectations and never bothers to take a step out of it. In a way, he has never really BEEN to the places he writes about. In this sense, he is not unlike those spoiled rich folks floating around in their luxury cruise ship gazing at the mediterranean world through rose-colored glasses, except that HIS glasses are an especially ugly shade of gray. Maybe he should give up traveling altogether- it appears to make him profoundly unhappy- and write humour columns for newspapers instead- a la Dave Barry. He'd be good at that."
2,not really interesting,"as much as I wanted to enjoy this, I could not- Theroux comes across as arrogant and prolix- purports to travel as a ""traveller"" but winds up being nothing but an educated tourist who never ventures further than the superficial layer of things... well-written but it gets lost in tedious and unnecessary sardonic commentary and details that add little to the narrative: I was expecting better..."
2,It put me off,"Started the book and realised that Mr Theroux has a keen eye for uglyness. His trip around Spain is really sad. I am sorry he couldn't find any of the wonderful towns and people on this coast. For his satisfaction, I can reassure him, he would be able to find his translated work not only in Barcelona, but in other coastal and inland cities and towns in Spain. Sorry to contradict, but there is not a bull fight on TVE everyday. I have found these chapters so misleading that I couldn't carry on with the book."
4,"Theroux changes location, but not his spots","Paul Theroux maintains the detached, somewhat morose mienwhich has carried him around the world. However, by notbecoming involved with his surroundings and the peoplewhich inhabit them, his views and opinions seem more real tome. The first part of the book is definitely the moreinteresting, perhaps because he feels less alienated whenhe's travelling in western countries than he does in theformer Yugoslavia, Albania and the Mideast. This book isnot as adventurous as some of the others, and seems moreintrospective to me. I liked it a lot, however, and suaggestthat reading it with a good map of the region at hand is a worthwhile endeavor."
2,the pillars of hercules,THE PILLARS OF HERCULESself righteous biased narrow minded author of THE PILLARS OF HERCULES misses the point that for many life is a matter of survival.
2,Pillars of Hercules,"I was disappointed. He had nothing good to say about anything. I did enjoy the many historical factual information references, however. It may well be that the area is as ""biased, mean, poor and dirty"" as he portrayed, but it was not pleasant reading. I wouldn't want to travel there, especially at the time of year he did, even if I could afford to."
1,Received 2 broken players and no rebate,"Ordered one, it was broken, exchanged it for a new one, it broke a couple of months later. And Rio ""never received our rebate form"", so we didn't get the rebate, either!"
1,Absolute P.O.S.,"I never was able to figure this thing out, it sucks. Piece of S---. Don't buy it. EVER."
4,Excellent,"I got this on sale from Amazon in the middle of December. Tried it out and all I can say is it's great. I find it easy to use, has good FM quality and good quality sound even at 64KB wma. The Rio Music Manager is easy to use, transfering files are quick even with USB 1.1.I liked it so much I splurged on a 512MB expansion flash memory that was also on sale and now store several albums worth of music for commuting and gym.If I were to make it better, I'd add support for other music compression types besides mp3 and wma, add support for transfering complete albums as playlists, instead of transfering music and then manually creating a playlist."
2,Please listen to logevity complaints you see here,"I give this player 2 stars because it was a very nice player for a few months before succumbing to the upgrader bug. I have had mine about 6 months now and am lucky to have it turn on properly in 1 try out of four. If I press the menu button without a feather-lite touch the unit shuts down completely and can take minutes to get working properly again. If you do buy, get an extended warranty."
1,"way too fragile for a ""sport"" player","i had mine for 6 months and was pretty happy with it but one day it just stopped working. it will turn on but it comes on paused, with the volume maxed out and unresponsive to the joystick and menu button. needless to say, rio tech support was slow to respond and wasn't very helpful.i am pretty disappointed in the fragility of what is supposedly a sports-oriented device (although i never did sports with it, i bought thinking it would be more rugged). i am not likely to ever buy anything from rio again. i should should have paid attention to the bad reviews on it and bought something else."
2,Rio missed the point,"There are two primary reasons to go with a flash based player rather than a hd based player: Weight, and durability. This is a light player all right and it also has a great battery life, unfortunately these devices are so fragile they must be treated like fine china.I've owned two of these units, both were used strapped to my arm in a neoprene case for running, neither unit was dropped, and both have failed from the ""upgrader bug"" (see rioworld.org for details) in an identical manner. The ""upgrader bug"" is fairly common and if it wasn't for the fact that I had bought the extended warranty from the retailer I would be out big bucks.Potential buyers: RIO players have the shortest warranty of any mp3 player on the market (3 months) and that fact should be informative."
1,Good while it lasted,It was great at first. I liked the sound and the software was easy to use. My Rio Sport on/off button stopped working after 2 months of use. My fault I didn't buy the extended warranty. So now it's useless. What a waste of money.
1,Rio Cali,I rate this product a 1 because I have bought 2 from 2 different merchants and neither one of them worked. I am in the process of returing the 2nd procduct.
1,Software SUCKS,"Got one of these for my girl for Christmas, and it is going back to the store TOMORROW. I'm sold on the form factor and it seems usable, but the software seems to be REQUIRED (meaning just plugging it in to any old computer is a no-op) and additionally it sucks ass (no simple file transfers using windows file system, have to use proprietary awfulness), so I'm going to find something better..."
2,Rio customer support is a myth.,"Overall, not a bad product. Small, light-weight, easy to use. If you have another CD ripping program and/or a collection of songs in MP3 or WMA format, loading music can be a simple drag-and-drop process using Windows Explorer.I had an issue, however, with the Rio cutting off a few select songs before they were done playing. That's when I found the black hole called ""Rio Customer Support"".First of all, there is no toll-free number to call. There is no way to submit a support issue via email in the US. That combined with limited hours of operation and limited resources with limited skills made for a very frustrating and expensive experience.If you are a software engineer and can design and trouble shoot your own firmware, I recommend this device. Otherwise, stay away!"
1,"Do not buy ANYTHING RIO-Pieces of Junk, Support Sucks!","I got this last August for my birthday. In January I could no longer transfer music on any of 2 computers to the player. I've been dealing with tech support since then and have not got an answer still. Also, when I set the FM stations to pre-sets, they are erased each time I turn the player off. My husband also had a Rio player, can't remember which model, and his just stopped working completely. Needless to say, I hate RIO and would never buy anything from them again."
3,A few models later... and it will be great,"The Rio sounded like an amazing deal and in general I am pleased but am disapointed with the red mouse button that no longer works 100% (it won't play on command) and the battery life that was advertised is not what I am getting. It does store the amount of music it claimed to which is great. I love that it is small, does not skip and comes with an arm-band. It is to bad the radio reception on these comes in poorly because I have to wear a sony radio and the rio mp3 for optimal options. I think if I had to do it over again I would have waited for a few models down the line till the manufaturer works out the kinks."
1,Do not buy any Rio products,"I bought the Rio Nitrus in Decemeber 2003 and in July 2004 6 months their was a bug in the MP3 code that caused it to completely broke down with no hope of fixing it.Rio had already known about this falty code from other cases but it refused to replace my unit without charging an $80 fee due to their 3 month warranty. (approximately half the price of the player).They should recall every Rio Nitrus on the market if their code causes it to break within 7 months or at least replace their faulty products free of charge.IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING AN MP3 AVOID THIS COMPANY.If anyone at Rio sees this, my case number was #727662. You'll find this message everywhere. You want me to stop, make good on my player and replace it."
4,Well worth the money I paid for it,"I haven't had any problems with my Rio. I think it's terrific, other than the software. But, I use MusicMatch and don't have problem dumping tunes down.I use it solely for my workouts. I'm not a video head, or have a need to download all of my 500 cds to it. For my workouts, it does it's job, and a good one, at that!"
1,Problems with this MP3 player from the first day.,"I had power issue with this player from the first time I tried to use it. At first the player would only start intermittently (even with a new battery installed). Eventually (after on a week of owning the player), it would not start at all. Rio technical support has been difficult to obtain and the do not offer a toll free support number. If you have problems, you will incur a toll call fee while you wait for assistance. Bad experiences all around. I have since owned both an IRock 128MB player and an IRiver 512MB player and have had much more success."
1,Keep Looking,"When I first got the Rio Cali it seemed to work fine, however after just a few months of light use it started to have problems. Initally the forward button would stop working and then a few weeks later it stopped working all together. This is stated to be a ""sport"" player and I only used it with light exercise and never dropped it. I've heard similar problems with this player, I'd look at another brand."
1,Can't get it fixed,I bought two of these for Christmas '03. Both stop working when you take them outside in the winter. You get a high pitched screech and they die.I have another problem with one and have been trying to send it back for repair since August 3rd it is now Aug 24th. Weeks of e-mails and phone calls and I finally get two numbers to call and fax. I do this and find both have been disconnected.Finally today I get another e-mail saying you'd be better off buying a new one since it is out of warranty. My feeling is they have no service capability. I would never buy another product from this company.
5,Great Versitile MP3 Player!,"I am so impressed with the Cali that I bought for my husband that I'm going out to get one for myself! I love the easy-to-use software! I found that you can easily download a MP3 upgrade (for FREE!) in order to RIP songs into MP3 format as well as WMA, FLAC, and OGG! It's lightweight, has an FM Tuner, an expansion slot for additional storage space, and is designed for an active lifestyle. What more do you need? I too had a little trouble at first with the ear buds, but quickly got used to them. When in use, they drown out nearly everything else going on. I love it! I stumbled across this one and have since looked at what else is out there. This is the MP3 player for me!"
2,Poor durability,"I had purchased an earlier 64MB Rio, and loved it. So when I wanted more memory, I naturally tried another Rio. As soon as got my new Rio home, it didn't work. I exchanged it for another, and that one worked for three months, and then the volume button stopped working.If it weren't for these problems, I'd rate it five stars. The controls are intuitive, and you can figure out everything without reading the manual. The only thin it lacks is the ""pants clip"" that the earlier Rio 64MB had - that is a lot more comfortable than the belt/arm device the new one has."
1,2 rio calis 128 /both junk,5 stars from anyone with 1 to 2 weeks use. Check anyone that had one over 3 to 6 months!BAD NEWS
4,One person's review of a fine player,"After lots of research on different brands, makes and models of MP3 players with FM tuners, I decided on this one. About the only thing I don't like is the Olive drab color. I wish other colors were available.Anyway, FM reception is decent. The included RIO Music Manager software is very easy to use. It allows setup of multiple folders on the hard drive and on the player as well. Even though this is called an MP3 player it doesn't come with any MP3 compression software. All the songs are compressed using the WMA format. All the songs I put on it didn't suffer from any compression losses that I can tell.The earbuds are fine.I haven't bought any SD media yet to check the expansion capabilities yet so I don't know how well that part of it works.Battery life seems to be as advertised.All in all I'm quite happy with it."
2,The software sucks!,"I've had probably 10 mp3 players and the Rio software is by far the worst of any I have ever seen! It is a complete disaster, inconvenient and frustrating as hell if you have more than a few mp3s on your computer. The best players have a simple drag and drop from Windows type format. Then there are alot of players that have proprietary programs that work pretty well. But this is the worst! And they haven't changed it from when I bought my first Rio 500 years ago! If you have a lot of mp3s on your computer Rio Manager will list them 2 or three times and then make it awkward to find them and download.I mean, what the hell is wrong with this company! It's like driving a well made car except half the windshield is covered up! Or driving a great car in a strange city and the maps are all screwed up! I don't get it!"
1,buy something else,"i have a rio cali 256 and 2 of my friends bought them as well. we have all had the exact same problems. the shuffle does not work, it repeats the same songs over and over. it has unformatted every sd card i have put in it. my friends will now not power on - but does come on when hooked up to the computer. and the problems go on and onevery time i have called technical support they have done the same things over and over - to no avail- and on my dime since they don't have a 1800 number. when they can't fix it they say ""oh well"". they have also told me on several of the problems that they were ""known"" problems, but still would not replace my player.my friends of course is now out of warranty and they will replace it for $69! I CAN buy a new one for that!it has been one of the worse purchases i have ever made. sony has a walkman version now. try their's!"
3,""" I Run With Mine """,I was really exited to get this product. It's my first mp3 player. It holds a lot of music. It's light weight and easy to use. It does have some downfalls. The clip it comes with is made of plastic and metal so it digs into your skin when you run with it/you will have to use the arm band. On a recent run it got to much sweat on it and cut off. The radio reception is not that great and that's what I was looking forward to as well. That is why I gave it 3 stars. It really depends on what you are going to use it for.
4,Fico,"This item is Great!!! It work with every program that dowload music.I highly reccomended, although the only problem is the memory space but the good thin is that you can buy a additional memory card."
2,Not worth the money,"I've had my rio cali for 2 months now and I really dislike it. I use it while running and have found that the joystick control is very hard to use while you're moving. I frequently hit up or down instead of forward and the display is too small to see when you are moving so I don't know what the player is doing.I don't like the metal belt clip because it rubs against my skin and chafes it... I might be allergic to the metal but I currently have two welts on me from the clip.My other complaint about this player is that if you want the songs to play in a particular order, you have to remove all the songs first. If you delete some songs and transfer some new ones, they will fill in the gaps and therefore be out of order. I find this really frustrating because I like to keep whole albums together rather than split between other songs.About the only thing I like about this player is how lightweight it is. I wouldn't recommend it for runners."
2,MP3 review :::: Beware of this one,"Rio Cali Sport 128MB MP3 player: I bought this MP3 player for my husband for Christmas. He uses it at the gym while he runs on the treadmill. Unfortunately, I now have to buy him another one. I certainly won't buy this one again. It continuously slips out of the armband while he is running. That is very frustrating. In addition, when downloading music, he has to transfer it to a CD and then to the MP3 player. It is very wasteful because the CDs can not be written twice. I learned my lesson the hard way. I'd try another MP3 player if I were you."
4,Easy to use,"This is a great player, it's my first one but it's easy to use, was easy to load the the software is a breeze to put to use. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a mid priced mp3 player with expansion capability and ease of use."
2,Battery only lasts 5 hours!,"I just bought mine this Saturday (today's Tuesday) and already it's used up 1 and half AAA batteries. I don't understand how people can agree it can last 18 hours. If anything each battery last only 3 hours for me. Otherwise, it's fine. Any thoughts? -mike"
3,Strange problem - won't stay on,"The device exhibits this strange behavior that every time I turn it on and start playing a song, it shuts off after about 5 seconds of play and then restarts itself. This behavior lasts for about 3-5 minutes, after which it works fine (no further shutting off). Otherwise the player seems to work OK."
1,Software and Technical Support Worthless,The software that comes with the Cali is unusable. I bought this to replace a Bantam MP3 player that I broke and I can say without hesitation it was the worse decision I ever made.The software is cludgy and very difficult to use.I called technical support. What a mistake. the tech told me to reformat my player but never checked to see if I had backed it up. When I pointed it out to them she hung up. Then I called again and was on hold for over 30 minutes. Then the Operator Tia Henderson apologized and transfered me to the wrong department and once again I got disconnected. I am now on hold for the 3rd time this morning and still no closer to a manager. Stay away!!!!!
3,"great product, not itunes compatible",I bought the rio on impulse with no real research--but I gotlucky as this is a great workout player: super light and thearm band and set up is well designed. Comes with very usefulcd ripping software (wdm only). Sound quality is excellent.Comes with excellent 'bud' style head phones. My only gripeis the small memory allocation (126 mg = less than 2 albums)and that it does not play itunes mp4 files. Amazing batteryperformance.
1,Technical Difficulties,"I just received the Rio Cali as a gift. The player seems pretty nice (it is the first one I have owned so I don't have much to compare it to). I have had trouble with getting assistance from their support team. I was having problems getting the USB connection to work so I tried sending an e-mail. After two days with no response I called their support line (this is not a toll free call). I spent an hour on the phone with someone who had me jump through a number of hoops (reinstalling the software, plugging it into a different USB port, trying a different computer, etc.) before she finally recommended that I exchange the player at the store for a new one. If you get one, I hope that you do not need to rely on Rio for support."
5,Great Player - Takes Abuse,"I have had this player now for over a year and use it for running 3-5 days per week. This thing has been through the mill, freezing temperatures, snow, severe rain, summertime heat and is still working great. I have never used the FM tuner so can't comment on that, also I must say the headphones that came with the unit were crap, purchased $40 Sony earbuds and the sound quality increased 10 times over. Very easy to use and navigate, memory is small, but great player for running, very durable."
3,Tech Support is AWFUL,"I have been unable to install the provided Music Manager software on my computer. Waited 35 minutes on hold to tech support, only to talk to someone who ""just started"" and never did get the problem resolved. The MP3 player armband and headphones are good. The sound from the FM tuner is excellent. Can't tell you much about loading music as I am unable to because I can't get the software to load and no one to help me!!"
3,an okay player,"This player is okay -- just okay. The headphones are comfortable (for a change!) and will fit nicely under a helmet. If it weren't for the headphones and the fact that it was easy to install and transfer songs, I would've given less because it lacks sound quality. My other two players (Zen Touch and Zen Neon, both by Creative Labs) have much, much better sound than the Rio Cali -- although they are not as easy to use. I prefer excellent sound quality over ease of use; however, this little player is convenient to strap on my arm and go."
1,Great Player Bad SportClip EarPhones,The player is Great but the SportClip Earphones went bad after 60 days...Trying to Get Rio To replace them is a nightmare...I have been waiting 45 days for them to replace the earphones no luck.. When I checked with the BBB in Santa Clara they have a consideral number of customer service complaints...I recommend not dealing with any company that ignores basic customer service of not replacing items under warranty..If you buy from RIO you are on your own...
4,GreatMP3 Player for the working out!,"I picked up this player a few months ago and it is great for my workouts (lots of running). It fits securely on your arm and is easy to operate. I have about 80 songs on it (mp3 and wma). It is simple to use. Downloading songs is a cinch. The only drawback is that sometimes while running the joystick is sensitive. Wait, one other thing ... the battery needs replacing a little too often, but that's true of most MP3 players. Besides it only uses one 3aaa battery and it is easy to change. Best of luck in your search!"
5,The sturdiest and most reliable MP3 player I've ever encountered.,"I've had my Rio Cali since they first came out. It has been through gardening, many falls and drops, house construction, more falls and drops, many bangs and knocks and it still works perfectly well. Nothing on it is broken and the screen is hardly scratched. These players were made to take abuse, and they are great for both working out with or just working with. I listen to it all of the time, and it has good quality sound and has an easily manageable format. I recommend this MP3 player very very highly."
4,cool,"I think this is a cool player. It doesn't have very much memory so i recently upgraded it to 512 MB. I also like the carrier, which is very nice. The headphones are ok, but have a ring w/them. The EQ's don't do well. Allover, I think this is an awesome player"
1,it was great....for a couple of weeks,i got mine as a christmas gift and a couple weeks after recieving it i couldn't download any songs onto the player or take songs off of the player. The player played nicely but the same songs are on it since last christmas.terrrrriiiibbbbllee!!!!!!!!!
1,worked great...for six months,"I bought this player for my girlfriend last Christmas. She loved it, and used it all the time. Unfortunately, over the summer the control stick stopped working. The player is one solid piece, so you can't even open it up to attempt a repair. Rio charges $70 for a replacement if you still have the receipt. No thanks, I'll try another brand from now on."
4,GREAT!,"This was the very first mp3 player I ever bought and I loved it. I only used it for cardio and loved it!GOOD1. Durable Design2. Make Playlists3. Easy to load songs4. Takes AAA batteries (don't have to recharge)5. Armband (I strapped it to my arm or to the cardio equipment if I was indoors--great!)6. FM Radio with PresetsBAD1. Low Memory (If you're only looking to put about 50+/- songs than it's great; I only bought a new mp3 because I needed more songs)2. A little heavy (Now I'm just being a little picky--if you put it on your arm it might be annoying, but it wasen't that big of a deal)3. Black & White Screen (This didn't bother me, as long as it worked, I didn't care)Overall I LOVED this mp3. If Rio would have made one in the same design but at least 1GB+, I would gave bought it in a heart beat. I bought the iRiver instead; it's good, but you can't make playlists and I really miss that feature!"
2,Hasn't lasted a year,"In the beginning, the player was great. Battery life was good and it was lightweight; however, the earphones were not the best. After the first three months, I noticed some static interference when playing my songs. The radio was fine. This quickly would be resolved by reformatting the memory and reloading the song (as well as updating the firmware). However, this ""static"" progressively got worse and now it's accompanied by a high pitch noise. Again, it can be resolved by reformatting, but once every few days is now a nuisance. The tech support quickly responds to my e-mails but they are not helpful and have not been able to solve the problem. Therefore, if you are comfortable with just using the radio option, then this is an okay player. If you want a long lasting product with good tech support, save your money for another product."
3,"ALERT: bogus reviewer, whet34","Just click on this whet34 guy's link (10/15/2003 review) and whaddaya know...12 out of the 13 reviews that he's written thus far (today being 12/12/03) have been of Rio MP3 players, all of them ranting about how absolutely horrible these things are! Obviously:1. He's a disgruntled former employee or soon-to-be former employee of Sonic Blue,2. He got dumped by some girl (or, who knows, guy) who works for Sonic Blue or owns a lot of their stock,or3. He is so incredibly moronic as to actually buy 12 products from the same manufacturer that he swears only makes absolute junk.Amazon, you need to do a better job of filtering out wackos like this!(I'm giving this product 3 stars because I've never owned it, they won't publish this review without a star rating.)"
1,I'm having the same problem,"I seem to be having the same problem that some of the other reviewers have written about. It will stop in the middle of a song and has to be started all over again. Sometimes it stops in the middle of powering up and won't re-start at all, but I can fix this problem by removing the battery and the SD card, and then re-inserting the battery and starting it again. Then the problem only occurs every now and then, not very often, but I wish I could use the card to hold my extra songs. Sorry! :-("
1,poor quality,I purchased this for my eight year old son. I was very disappointed. The camera is very cheaply made. Although it is digital it does not have a screen on the back of the camera to view the photos you have taken. The only way to see the photos is to download them onto a computer. The camera is supposed to take short videos but I was not able to do so.
3,Not professional,"Its cheap ! But if a good tablet is critical to your work go for Wacom ones. I didnt want to spend too much, coz I'm not a professional artist. This tablet would be bad decision if you know that you need a tablet. I didnt know, I wanted to experiment and for that purpose its good. But a better option would be to ask someone who knew. You can go for that option coz now I KNOW and I suggest that its not good enough for professionals.Its pen is jittery so is its mouse, being an artist the precision that you look for is simply missing.Every thing else is OK, like it worked with little work required on my part after connecting it to the computer."
1,Go Wacom. Period.,"Not only is Wacom continuously upgrading their drivers, their tablets perform flawlessly. I own a PenSketch and I suffer from the same problems other reviewers have complained about: the click detection is erratic; a right-click and a middle-click will often send a false left-click as well. Genius is not only not updating their drivers (at the very least) to compensate for the faulty sensors: useful troubleshooting is almost impossible to come by."
1,Incorrect product picture,"I purchased this product thinking it was the compact head, because that was the picture item. But when I received the product I found it was the standard size head. I also discovered the product was priced $8 lower after I received the product.I conducted Amazon, but received no response, other than to give me authorization to return the product. I was not offered an opportunity to exchange the product, nor even receive a refund for the difference in price.Returning it was more of a hassle than it was worth, so I kept the brushes, but still I was disappointed. Based on previous experiences, I would have thought Amazon would have permitted me to exchange them, or at least offer me a credit for the difference in price."
4,excellent service,I am a newcomer to this service and I waited many days past the est day of arrival before I contacted someone about not receiving my toothbrushes. I got an immediate and very courteous response. In 2 days I had my toothbrushes!! I am as pleased with the service as I am with the merchandise!
5,Thank goodness Amazon had these,It is so hard to find the compact heads for this toothbrush...and the price is awesome!
5,Sonic Toothbrushes,"I am very pleased with the Sonic toothbrush system. The dentist reports that I have less plaque on my teeth since using the Sonic toothbrush. I have been using it for about 5 years now, and I hope it doesn't get discontinued."
1,Brush Heads were SOFT,"I came online to buy brush heads for my Sonicare toothbrush because I own an older version and have trouble finding the correct replacements in stores. I found them to be almost useless. The brushes were so soft I doubt they would last two weeks. In fact, the brush heads that I was replacing which were 8 months old had more firmness to them than the brand new brush heads that I ordered here. Either I just got a bad pair (yes, both were the same), or someone is scamming people. These brush heads appeared to be the used ones that people throw out after using them for the recommended six months. If I knew how to request a refund, I would do it. These people should be ashamed of themselves. I have been using Sonicare for over 10 years and buying the brush heads at retail outlets and have never bought a pair of brush heads of such poor quality. Beware of these brush heads! Anyone else have a similar experience with these brush heads?"
4,Works for me,"I know there are newer, more expensive Sonicare models, but mine has worked for me for years. My dentist is happy, I'm happy.Favorite Books:Indigeneity in the Courtroom: Law, Culture, and the Production of Difference in North American Courts (Indigenous Peoples & Politics),In Search of Lost Time: Proust 6-pack (Proust Complete),The Pinch Runner Memorandum,Ulysses"
2,replacement brush,"Usually when I buy these they are two different colors in one package - this makes it easy for my husband and I to know which is which. But this came both the same colors. I feel cheated! Had I known, I would not have bought them and feel the ocmpany took advantage of knowing I would not see them. Maybe I'm wrong but I am disappointed.As long as we're at it, I was disappointed in my previous (a while ago now) purchase of the toothbrush through Amazon. It does not beep every 20 secs. like it's supposed to. I should have returned it but didn't want to take the trouble.Thanks for listening."
1,Not Too Thrilled Over the Price,"I like my Sonicare and replace the brushes every 6 months. So I go online to order new A-Series brushes from Amazon like I always to and I see Amazon doesn't carry them, but an Amazon seller does ... for $70. Are they serious? That's more than I paid for the whole thing in the first place. How does the seller sleep at night? Does he feel any guilt?"
5,Sonciare review,"Items were received in an expedient manner and even though one of the items was incorrect, the seller was friendly and courteous in getting another one sent to me.Great public relations!!!"
3,Quality control,"Item performs as indicated by manufacturer. However, one of the brushes failed after a short time. The magnet at the base of the brush separated from the unit. It was not worth the trouble to try to glue the magnet back in place; it was disgarded. If this problem returns, we will not purchase any part of the product again."
5,Been Using Sonicare for for 8 years,"Very Good product. I thought about the price of the replacement heads as being expensive at one time, but had to think about the value more. I need my teeth!! Anyway, think about it.You get 2 replacemant brushes that last for 1 year for less than $30. (change every 6 months) I am on my 2nd toothbrush. The 1st lasted at least 5-6 years. Good investment!!"
1,Sonicare toothbrushes,"Please advise Sonicare that when we received the toothbrushes, we pluged in the Sonicare Unit and it will not start, so we must cancel the every 6 month contract to send new toothbrushes, until we can purchase a new Sonicare Unit.Please advise how I can contact them direct or if you can let them know for us.Thanks you so much.Donna Wright"
4,healthy teeth,What's to say about Sonicare replacement brushes. They last a year and keep away the plack.
5,Recommend Sonicare to anybody,"I have been brushing with a sonicare for 18 months. My dentist recommended it to me, especially because I was getting braces. I can't believe how clean my teeth look and feel. I never have bleeding gums any more. My orthodontist and dentist have both commented on the suprub shape of my gums. I couldn't be more happy! Defenitely worth the money!!!"
4,You can find cheaper elsewhere,"I am shocked at the price of this at Amazon...Over $60. The same exact replacement sells for $29 at Sears.Just google ""sonicare replacement toothbrush"" and you will see a picture of the replacement for Advance. Its the first one on the left. I just read that the E replacement will fit on the Advance toothbrush. With that said, I may try the E which is sold at Walmart and if it does not fit, I can return it. I do like the Advance brush but it gets all yukie around the greenish part of the toothbruse at the base. I can't seem to get that old toothpaste out of there no matter how much I soak it. Good luck people"
3,Child Size,The only surprise was the size of the head. About half the size of a regular or original size that came with it. Quality was fine and business fast and efficient.
2,good while it lasted,I bought 2 of these coffee makers. Both died on me. My digital clock goes haywire! The grinder doesn't stop grinding at all at times. And the coffee is weak!
2,Needs More Work!,After having read all the good reviews (none really bad) I feel I must have bought a lemon. It arrived with the bean container broken. Had to send it back. The basket seldom went back into the correct position. For some reason water would leak down the front of the machine and get all over the warmer/burner and the counter. Coffee grounds would also be on the counter. We sent it back yet again. After having it for not quite two years it stopped making coffee (don't know if electronics were haywire) even when buttons were pushed manually. It even burned a spot on my counter while giving off an extremely offensive burning smell. To its credit the grinder still works. But since the rest of it doesn't work it is a very counterspace grabbing coffee grinder!
4,Best coffee this side of Europe or Seattle,"Bought one of these factory refurbished, but it came with a full mfrs warranty. The coffee is excellent, except that on 2 cups, its a little iffy. I always set if for at least 4. But the taste is rich, the quality is excellent, and the customer service of Capresso is unbelievably wonderful. I had a small problem, they shipped me a new machine that arrived in two days, with a return UPS label. (Didn't cost me a cent!). I can't say enough good things abou this unit. (except, as I mentioned, it doesn't work that well at the two cup setting.)"
5,Automatic coffee wakeup service,"I just love my Capresso Coffee Team. I wake up mornings to the sound of fresh coffee beans grinding in the built-in commercial burr grinder, then the next sensation is the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. It makes the best coffee I have ever tasted"
5,love it,"this is by far the best coffee maker we've had for 40 years.it's so easy to use. it's clean, no bean mess, we are buying 2 more for our son-in-laws. we love it."
2,Not Strong Enough!,"A great concept, but this coffee maker simply does not make a strong enough cup of coffee. Even on the strongest settings the coffee comes out weak and tea-like. The grinder settings are based on the number of cups you intend to make. To make a stronger coffee (for example) you need to set the grinder for a higher number of cups than the amount of water you put in. I like to make 9 or 10 cups of coffee every morning, but the grinder only goes up to 10 making it impossible to have it put more coffee in the filter. I think a ""12"" or even ""14"" setting would solve my problems.This unit also drops ground coffee on the counter under the grinder after the filter swings back over the caraffe."
1,Two in one or nothing at all,"I bought this with the idea that I have a grinder and a coffeemaker in a space-saving design. Until the grinder broke and gave it to service...I obviously did have neither a grinder nor a coffeemaker.Also I want to point out that the coffee flavor is not exactly what I expected - the coffee is not real hot. Cleaning of the grinder is inconvenient.I definetely will go back to my faithful Braun coffeemaker (KF187)that I enjoyed for over 8 years without any single disappointment. And they have a great grinder as well.Consequently, only one star for the concept. The performance and convenience aspects are lousy."
1,Mis-advertising,"This Capresso coffee machine is NOT made in Switzerland,as advertised,but in Portugal?"
5,Impressive and Easy Machine,"I've owned all types of coffee makers but this one surely gets the prize. It makes the best cup of coffee... in any setting... and any grind. The beans are always fresh in the hopper and the water tastes good because of the filter. It's easy to program, easy to use, easy to clean. All around GREAT COFFEE MAKER.If you like pressed coffees or ultra strong oily coffees this is not the maker for you... stick to your presses and pressure machines for those types of coffee but if you like just the best regular ""pot of coffee"" to serve daily or for guests then GET THIS ONE. It's beyond fresh, and it's fantastic!! And it's fun as heck to watch!"
5,"The coffee you want, when and how you want it!","My Partner and I had 2 Grind type coffee makers before this, trying to find one that does what this machine does. It's simple to operate as long as you're willing to read ALL the instructions and pay attention to what you're doing. We're extremely pleased and have stopped our search for the perfect pot. Just add the beans, making sure they are not directly from your freezer or refrigerator, add the water, set the timer, brew strength and grind fineness and you're all set. Have the perfect cup any time of the day or night."
2,Needs Improvement,Owned the coffee maker for two years and it finally failed. Problems with pot which dripped coffee over the counter whenever you poured a cup; auto-stop function failed allowing coffee to drip onto heating element when pot was removed mid-cycle; coating on heating element wore away. Never had a problem with auto-grinding function. Coffee temperature was never hot.
1,Don't Ignore ANY Review,"Every review is VALID.Whether or not the owners manual has a ""disclaimer"", the reality is key information was missed by the consumer. Capresso doesn't clearly identify that they test the machine prior to shipment. That's the problem. Capresso can fix the documentation just as they can fix the water leak... if they chose to.Capresso should put a sticker on the machine that reads ""Machine tested and may appear used"". It would save a few machines being returned for no good reason."
5,A true underdog story,"One of the great underdog stories in U.S. sports history, overlooked until now. Very interesting to learn how the coach took his winning tactics from the Russians and set the stage for the gold medal win in 1980. He was a true innovator in that respect. And the individual chapters on each player help bring their stories to life. Amazing to learn of the players who served in Vietnam before going to Japan and winning a silver medal. Overall it's the kind of story you wouldn't believe if not for the fact that it really happened. Have to wonder what the legacy would be if it took place in America, or if we were able to follow it on live tv. In today's world this would be all over the front pages of every newspaper and magazine, but back then it was virtually unknown. Glad this story was finally told, this book will occupy a space next to my favorites in my sports library."
4,Striking Silver,This was a great book about a team and I had a great interest in the individual players. This team was ignored and had a wonderful record.I have been able to visit with several of the players and highly recommend the book.
1,Pretty Bad.,"Spelling: numerous spelling issues, from misspelled words to duplicate words, to words left out.The plot: acceptable and enjoyable through the first half of the book, then it seems that another author picked up the writing and the plot became totally unrealistic."
2,Great Pattern --- BUT!!!,"I bought these dishes because I love the pattern. It is perfect for my new house. However, after only a few months of use, about a third of them have chips out of them - some small and some very large. They chip very easily. In fact, they come out of the dishwasher chipped. Also, they are not good for using in the microwave. They get too hot!!! Somehow, they get very hot but the food on them does not. I am very disappointed and am looking for a replacement pattern."
3,I liked the style and the use of the Miracle worker.,"I liked the style and the use of the Miracle worker. I enjoyed Sarah's personal journey, but some aspects of the plot were a little tired, I like this book but it didn't wow me, I am a little indifferent to it."
5,A Sensitive Protrayal,"The teen years are fraught with pitfalls and difficulties as teens explore new roles and relationships in their search for their own identities and direction. Sarah is one of these. She sheds her ""good girl"" image in order to befriend Robin who appears to lead a much more exciting life. In doing so, Sarah makes important discoveries about herself. This process of discovery is movingly and convincingly depicted in Stephanie Hempill's book. She has a real understanding of adolescent issues and gives a sensitive, accurate portrayal of female friendships. The verse form only adds to the emotional intensity and impact of the story. Teen girls, and others too, will be touched by this eminently readable book. I would recommend it not just for teen girls but for their teachers and parents as well."
1,NYT Review of Books,Order placed early June. First issue of subscription not yet received. This is service?
3,Great product but lousy service,"I purchased this subscription as a gift for my wife. Unfortunately, Magazine Express could not start the subscription for almost eight weeks. I put up with this indignity because the price seemed reasonable. My wife loves the Review and reads every word.It would be nice if the delivery was consistent. Magazine Express really is a mediocre company. Some weeks we don't receive the week's review and then the next week we get two different editions. This not what I signed up for. Please, one review per week delivered on or about the same day of each week would be nice."
1,Don't deal with this company.,Horrible company. Don't deal with this company. I never got an issue. They make it very difficult to get a refund.
1,Still waiting...,It's been 6 weeks since I placed my order and I have yet to receive my first issue. I contacted Magazine Express to inquire about my order and they never responded.
3,Celia,"Actually, after having acquired Celia's later albums which are very up beat with great orchestrations and arrangements, this album was a let down. It's Celia before she became the dynamic ""Salsa Queen"" whom we remember."
3,It's good if you use with care.,"The sound quality is not bad for a $5 earphone, however the biggest flaw is that the jack plug is very delicate. I went through 2 of this in a span of 11 months. If you use this earphone on the laptop and move around often, (like I do) chances are, you may break the wire connecting to the jack cable. That results in one side defective. (twice) If you shift around often, I recommend getting one with a jack plug in a L shape."
4,good headphones for the money,"I really only bought these because they got me over the qualification on free shipping but I really like them! For the money, I dont think you can beat them!"
3,The headphones were OK,"THE PRODUCT WAS OK, AVERAGE. They were not what I was expecting, but at least they worked fine."

2,Bad rating because of the binding,"My low rating is because of the terrible binding by the publisher, Weiser/Red Wheel. It is simply awful. It was just delivered to me by Fed Ex. Upon removing it from the box I noticed it is already coming loose from the spine! Weiser did a very poor job on this edition. The typeset is pretty bad too. I cannot believe Weiser has the nerve to price this book as high as it is. I plan on contacting the publisher directly to complain. There is no excuse for this. Thankfully I acquired this book using store credit issued by Amazon.com. If I had actually paid for this I would be furious."
1,TERRIBLE,"They have taken a wonderful piece of occult literature and reduced it to a piece of garbage. Cheap, low budget, low quality; a shame."
4,Great book,"I bought this book as a study guide for my MSDBA certification. What I found was an easy-to-read and understand reference guide which will far outlast the passage of the exam. The answers to the questions are not written within the book but are supposed to be on the CD (supplied); however, I cannot seem to retrieve them. Worth while book. I recommend it for anyone working with SQL Server 7.0."
3,Very good book with an awful CD,"I found the book to be a very good one. It covers all the material that you need -theoretical stuff and the real world stuff. It gave me a very good way to learn every topic. Unfortunately the CD that came with the book wasn't as good. The CD stores the answers for the questions at the end of each chapter in the book. In some cases that wrong answers were given (for example - Null is the same as empty string, OLTP databases should be heavily indexed etc'). I ended up studying with the book and left the CD (In the book I didn't find those mistakes). I hope that they have another edition with a CD that is as good as the book."
3,A good book with errors in the tests,I found the book to be useful and slanted towards real-world practice. Good examples and projects at the end of each chapter. Both tests on CD have several wrong answers.
3,Love P.L. Gaus' books,I have read all his books except the latest one and love them. The newest one is on my Christmas list. I lived about 90 minutes from where most of these took place and spent a lot of time in Wooster. Reading his books makes me feel like I'm back home. I have learned a lot about the Amish from him. Will keep buying his books. My thanks to the author.
3,It's OKay,I wasn't too crazy about this book.Maybe it's becaouse I've read so many books about the Amish. That this wasn't really all that great.I felt like the writter could have told us more about the characters then he was letting us know.Not a favorite but good for some one who has just started to read Amish Fiction books.
1,"Not very interesting, really.....","I gave up on this one about half-way through it, a rare occurrence for me. I just decided I didn't really care who did it or why. To me, it reads more like a potential made-for-TV script. No background or motivational stuff going on here, just some characters with some thin dialogue. Honestly thought I would really enjoy it for the Amish setting."
5,Awesome band,This band will blow your mind and needs so much more exposure than they have. This band will make you move regardless of how you feel. Some songs have such a awesome groove that its incredible. And the singer has so much intensity in his voice you will get pissed off for just by listening to the first song.Pick this up asap if you want some real heavy metal.
3,Near Impossible to Assemble,"This is my second Hunter fan and I wish I had listened to other reviews who warned about the difficult assembly. I am incredibly handy and putting this fan together was insanely frustrating. The only reason we did not give up is that returning the fan seemed even like more of a pain. As I said, this was my second purchase from Hunter, but it will be my last. The fan operates okay. It is nothing special."
4,"First order broken, but company was very helpful in getting a replacement","The first time we got this item the band around the fan (I believe the safety feature) wouldn't fit because part of the fan was bent. We contacted the company and they immediately sent us a replacement fan. While it was a hassle, the fan works nicely. The lowest setting you can't even hear when on. But the higher the setting, the more noise it makes. I still love it."
1,"Original and replacement broken, returning both.","We thought this fan would be perfect for us. It's sturdy and looks great. But after only 2 weeks, it just stopped working and refused to turn back on. Amazon sent us a replacement, but when we opened the box we found the 2 metal parts that surround the motor were bent and wouldn't fit together. So both fans are going back for a refund. Very disappointed with this purchase - Hunter seem to have some quality issues to work out."
2,Hunter 90121 oscilating pedestal fan,Wow - I'm very disappointed with this fan's performance! I have several excellent Hunter ceiling fans that I'm very happy with. Based on that experience I ignored some warnings that other customers had posted and bought this model 90121 oscillating pedestal fan anyway. Yes it's a hassle to assemble but if you take your time it's no big deal and yes the directions are somewhat lacking but the major issue is it just doesn't move much air. It makes a lot of noise but no air flow. Heed my advise and look for another manufacturers product.....you will be happy you did so.
4,Hunter Fan,Have Hunter ceiling fans and needed two floor fans to move air in the Great Room and MB they are quiet on low setting and look great. Only problem is the ability to rotate did not last long before they started grinding would have thought this ability would lasted longer.
2,Never worked as I would have liked,"Not sure how long we owned this fan, but about a year. Assembly was a little challenging, but not too bad. From the get-go, the oscillating feature made too much noise, so I simply left it in a static position. Worked OK on high power in my bedroom for about 6 months. After 6 months it started making noises that were fixed with a quick whack to the motor. A couple of months later, it started coming on very slowly. It would take about 5 minutes or more to kick on. Finally, it just started making a horrendous noise & I shut it down. I figured that the motor was done & have ordered a new fan. I liked the look & size of this model. Think I paid about $100+. Take this for what it's worth."
3,"Very well made, but clinks","I was very impressed with the quality of this fan durring assembly, after assembly we turned it on and it makes a very loud clinking sound on oscillating on every turn cycle. I called Hunter customer service and they told me to return to Amazon. After contacting Amazon for a return, they want me to return it in original package which i destroyed unpacking it.. So I guess I will just deal w/the clinking."
2,SERIOUSLY CONSIDER OTHER FANS,"YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER OTHER FANS. THIS MODEL HUNTER IS A REAL PAIN IN THE A** TO ASSEMBLE, SCREWS STRIP OUT EASILY, MAKES LOTS OF NOISE WHEN RUNNING, AND IS SOMEWHAT INCORRECTLY ASSEMBLE AT THE FACTORY. NOT THE QUALITY ONE WOULD EXPECT TO GET FROM A ""HUNTER"" PRODUCT."
1,Don't do it,"I foolishly thought it was just a poor photo, but the shirt is indeed actually more pink than Cardinal. Definitely not the right color."
1,Pretty looks don't compensate for poor performance,"I got this after two of my Linksys routers fryed and I was impressed at first (except that it doesn't support AES encryption). It looked like something you would see in a borg cube. Things started going downhill about two weeks in. About once per day I had to release and renew the IP address to get online. I could not change the channel to 11 no matter what I did. It would only work in the 108 mode which only works on Channel 6. My 2.4 Ghz phone wasn't a problem but now it will kill the connection the moment I turn on the phone. The other problem is that I have spotty reception despite the MIMO even though the router is only about 20 feet away. I don't know what happened, maybe I was hypnotized by the pretty lights. :-)"
1,RangeWimp would be a better name,"I ""upgraded"" from my old $29 netgear wireless router to improve range. Bottom line; absolutely no improvement in range. Maybe with the Rangemax wireless card it would be better, but not with standard wi-fi. I'm regret having spent the money."
1,It stopped working...just like for everyone else.,"I loved this router for about a year. Easy to set up and use, and range and strength seemed good. Now, after a year or so, it just drops the connection at random intervals...I have to unplug it and let it sit for a minute...then it comes back up fine for a while...then stops working again. Judging by all the other similar reviews this is a genuine problem with this product. I so don't feel like spending the money on another router either...sigh...nothing else to do...now my wife and I both have wireless-enabled laptops and I don't know how to get by without it."
2,Technical Support Stinks!,"I just bought this product. I could NOT get it to install on my computer...I finally broke down and called customer support. Ugh.I had a very hard time understanding the person on the other end of the phone. The accent is very thick. It was a test of my patience! The call took longer than it should have because of me constantly having to ask, ""pardon me? Excuse me? Could you repeat that?""The product itself? Not sure yet. I finally (!!) got it installed."
1,Nice until the random disconnects start,"This was a nice router before starting to get random disconnects.I have 7 wireless devices that connect to it and I noticed that when all of them are connected, there is a very high likelihood that the connection will drop soon. However, other times even with only 2 connected devices, I will get random disconnects.Types of traffic necessary for random disconnect:1. Low traffic. Random disconnect will happen with a frequency of one a day.2. Steam Client traffic (i.e., I have steam on one of the computers): Several times a day.3. Bit torrent (i.e., downloading Ubuntu 10.10): Very frequent. Solution: download via HTTP.In conclusion, this has to be one of the worst routers I've ever had."
3,GOOD BUT COULD BE BETTER,Did not buy on Amazon. Bought locally form the computer repair people. Good machine but does not handle wireless printing at this time. The gearheads at NETGEAR ARE WORKING ON A FIX WITHIN 2 MONTHS.It does great for wireless internet. It does not do wireless printing as my old Netgear did.I have my printer wired to the router. The laptop will have to wait to print wirelessly till the fix is in. The blue lights can now be turned off in v3. Not a problem. Just an FYI.
1,I switched back to my wireless G router...,"I purchased this router about a year and a half ago with a new laptop equipped with Wireless-N thinking I would also want to upgrade my wireless network. I selected this one because of the price and I regret doing so.I eventually unplugged this and plugged my old wireless-g router back in. Both wireless and wired connections were much slower with this router. The wireless also had a habit of dropping the connection entirely. Next time I get a router, I guess I'm going to have to spend a little more and get better quality.Also of note: It has no built-in firewall.I definitely DO NOT recommend this router."
5,Netgear MIMO router review,Fast shipping and good response to queries. I bought a refurbished item. It has been more than 2 years since I purchased this item. It has been working fine. I recommend this product.
3,Netgear WPN824NA Wireless Mimo Router,This is not what its cracked up to be. I love Netgear but this router's range is very over rated. Poor range and do not buy refurbished Netgear products. There is zero customer support and no updates.
1,Just out of warranty - FAILS,It's just worthless to buy a modem that stops working pretty much the day it goes out of warranty -- which this one did and will to you. Get a different model. This one will cost you double since you'll have to replace it.
4,Pretty Good,"The only problem I have had with our wireless set up using this router was having to switch to WEP so my son could use it with his Nintendo DS Lite. I had to re-configure my laptop's wireless card (be sure that you have the latest drivers and SW -- I didn't). I had to reduce the maximum speed down to 11 Mbps, so I am not planning on doing any printing through the network until I get a different router for my son to use. It uses a browser based interface so its pretty easy to deal with. I have yet to get the Wii to adjust to the new settings. Through-put is fine as our cable modem is only like 6 Mbps anyway."
1,Was never able to even configure it!,"I am a big fan of Netgear equipment. In fact this router was supposed to replace my trusty Netgear WGR614 that served me flawlessly for over 5 years of continuous power-on service before dying this week. After hooking up this new RangeMax router and the install routine confirming that I was connected to the router, I could never log into the router nor get connected to the internet. I finally gave up and returned it. Today I bought a new Netgear WGR614 v9 ... you know the model that served me so well for over five years ... Netgear still makes them! ... and the install was plug and play. Could log right into the router and configure the wireless and had instant internet access. Get the WGR614 if you want a reliable wireless router!!"
3,Do Not Buy this router if you want to do port forwarding!,"I have this router for less than one week, and found trouble with the port forwarding, then I searched the internet, found several forums have lots of complains about the same issue, there is no fix firmware available from netgear site. the problem is, after you set up the port forwarding, the records would be saved, then after a few hours, or even mintutes, you will find the forwarding suddenly disappear, you go check the setting, found the saved forwarding records' gone. then you try to re-create again, you receive conflicts of the service... at this point, you have no choice, you have to re-set the router and do it over again, but the chance is, it will happen again. If you don't do the port forwarding, you will be fine, this router has better signal strenght, and better range, I compared with D-Link, Linksys and Airlink routers, this WPN624 wins the game!"
4,wpn 824,"I have had my router for almost a year and a half now. I am thankful that with my version 2 of the router, that they included the button to turn off the flashing lights. I want a router, not a disco ball. That notwithstanding, I have had no trouble out of it. It is simple to use. My recommendations to anyone is to constantly check the netgear site for the router and update the router's software. You find your router, go to support, and then download it to your desktop. Then through any webbrowser (i use firefox) type in the address bar 192.166.1.1 . That will access the router, and help you name your network, set a password, etc. Go to upgrade, and click browse and then find the file that is on your desktop. and then click update. A couple of things extra, change the password from admin password as soon as possible, and please change the network name from something other than the generic netgear."
3,"Netgear WPN824, great until it dies","I had this router for about a year, then all the sudden it just died. It did work great, I had no problems with it at all. I even had the version with the switch on it to shut off the lights. I really like Netgear routers because of their web-filtering capabilities, which I have not found on another brand. I now have the ZyXel X-550, which is a nice router, but the web filtering function is really lacking. I think I'm sending it back and getting another one of these..hopefully it will last longer this time."
3,Good but with an important problem,"I have bought this router for 2 month, and everything is OK but one thing, in these two month it crashed 2 times and you have to reboot it to fix it, and there is no update to fix it."
2,range MAX?,"Quite simply, this router is not at all what its cracked up to be. The range is lousy, hardly MAX at all. Great signal within 5 feet, but almost none only 50 feet away and with only one simple wall in the way. Our house is not so large that we shouldn't get a signal most anywhere."
1,"bad range, worse reliability","This had great reviews many places, but sadly it falls short of everything. The range is worse than the Linksys it replaces, the router goes down 4-5 times a day and it HATES my Netgear Skype phone (SPH101).Netgear SPH101 Skype Wi-Fi PhoneNetgear was good in the mid 90's, then went to junk again early in 2000, then back to good in 03, but since 05 they are back in the junk bin. I will never buy Netgear again and I am beyond an advanced user."
4,"Working fine, but assume it could be better ????","Just bought the product on Friday. It is working wonderfully so far. I am using both a PC (Wired to Router by Cat6 cables) and a Notebook (wireless) and I am having no problems. My ISP is Road Runner, and I have not had a missed or dropped connection on either Machine. On the Notebook (Wireless), I am getting 54 mbps using the factory (Intel) installed Internal prowireless 3945a/b/g network card. I do not have the 2.0 range max USB adapter or the Range MAX wireless card installed. The only issue I have though, is that no matter how close I am to the router with my notebook, the wireless signal is always either good or poor, never excellent. Never the less, I am getting 54 mbps with the wireless connection. Anyone have a soultion to better wireless reception and better MBPS's on the wireless system???"
1,Worst router I have ever owned,"I have had this router for over two years now. In all frankness, I have never had a worse router than this. I run into problems with this router at least four times a week. The signal just dies off and it only reconnects after resetting/ rebooting the router. I am a software engineer and quite savvy with all things electronic. I have tweaked every possible setting that is available but nothing gives. I finally put it in the trash today and went out and purchased a new router."
2,Great router if you are looking for 1 year's worth!!,"I bought this router that was recommended to me buy a Best Buy rep. The set up was ok, but had to call customer support which was prompt and very helpful. The router worked great everywhere in my 1500sq foot home with minor incidents. Than, this month. exactly 1 year after I bought it, I started having major issues of losing connectivity and blinking orange lights...I first thought it was my modem, or issues with the ISP...Nope, the router was the culprit. I called the 800 in the manual for support and got a big SORRY CAN'T HELP after 1 year and a week.... I was left with the online e-mail support, which was not helpful at all and after a couple of e-mails back and forth they said it was hardware issues and because I was over the 1 year period I was......screwed out of $90.00Good luck, if you want to try it. I am going for a company that will back their products longer."
1,Sad,This router is not really that bad. But the company treats it customers soooo poorly that buying it is not a very good idea.The router seemed to work for a while but then quit. Customer support would only be provided at a price. I didn't bite. I am looking for something better.I would avoid ALL Netgear products until they support their customers and provide better tested equipment.
5,Happy with my purchase,"I have been using my wireless router for about a month now and it's been just fine. Superficially, it's efficient on space and has a slim, discrete design. It also does the job just fine though my demands are minimal: I just need to connect several computers and laptops to it to access my internet connection. It's easy to set up and easy to install. I have no comments to offer about customer support since I haven't needed to contact them. So, I'm happy with the router. No complaints so far!"
2,Unsatisfied with Performance,This router is not worth your money. It drops the wireless signal when both my desktop PC and Macbook are using the internet. Don't waste your money!
1,Short life & Must Reboot Almost Daily,I just had this router die after 2 yrs. The range- poor (20 feet un-obstructed or less on the same floor). Had all the same problems others discuss- having to unplug & reboot almost everyday because the connection is lost- what a pain!! I will NOT buy another Netgear. It never worked well from the time I got it. Cheap-you get what you pay for.
2,I think mines Defective,I got this when it first came out with high expectations and at first it was great. But now the range is less than 20 feet and wont go upstairs. I also have to unplug it once a day because all connections are lost. It is really bothering me. I think I need a new one and its only four years old.
5,Awesome Product,"I purchased the Net Gear WPN824 wireless router to replace my D-Link di624 wireless router. Setup was fast and easy with very nice menus. I had it up and going within 5 minutes! The flashing blue lights on the top do get old after a while, but it now is packaged with a black plastic circle piece to stick over the blue flashing lights. The coverage and signal strength is awesome from any place within my home, even outside on our deck. It has 5 wired rj45 ports and does support 128 bit encryption. One thing to remember is to release then renew the IP addresses on any wireless devices you had on a previously existing wireless network. I am in complete awe at the wireless strength and am very happy with my Net Gear purchase!"
3,Fair but not great,I'm a techie and gear is gear. You can't beat the price on this box. Nice firewall function and I like the ability to bridge wireless from another router to this router. The range is not as great as my old DLink- I wanted to replace due to age. I'm putting this on ebay or using it for the living room so the wife can work from the couch. I'm buying another DLink as the firewalling and range has improved. The D-Link DGL-4300 looks good. I don't see myself buying from Netgear again.
1,Outing FTP service does NOT work - don't buy,"I had a perfectly good Linksys wired router but my family wanted wireless, particularly my son, the Xbox Live player. Well the Xbox wireless adapter will not work with the wireless N routers and only certain G routers, this Netgear RangeMax being one. Bought and installed and Xbox Live was working great BUT as a webmaster, I could no longer upload files to working web servers - Winsock error #10061. I checked the router setup and no services were blocked, fellow webmaster with different routers could ftp to those same web servers. OUT-GOING FTP DOES NOT WORK! Tech support is unresponsive. Google this router and FTP problems and you will find many unhappy, former owners. It gets returned today."
2,"Disappointing--Old Netgear ""11b"" router had better range","The RangeMax is a misnomer. I purchased this router to replace our old router (model 614), since it gave only a weak signal on the second floor at the other end of the house. The so called ""RangeMax"" is even worse. Even on the same floor, where the old one was a champ, the signal is moderate. On the second floor, sometimes there is no signal. I would not recommend purchasing this router if your main requirement is range and strong signal. I feel that I have wasted my money. I hope I can return it."
1,Disappointed,In trying to install the Netgear Wireless Router(WPN824)on my system I have had some major problems. I have contacted Netgear support. My internet server is satellite. My modem is a DW6000 modem/router. It has taken two weeks of contacting Netgear support just to be able to make communication with my computer to their WPN824.Their directions suggest 20 minutes for installation. I am maybe half way there and I have had the unit three weeks. I am told by friends who have standard dial-up modems they have had no problems installing the WPN824. I will keep trying.
2,Buy something else.,"I have owned this item for a little over 4 months now, and have had nothing but trouble with it. I run 2 wired desktops, 1 wireless desktop, a Voip phone, a laptop, and an Ipaq all under one roof. This thing is a nightmare. It wouldn't let the wireless desktop on except under special occasions like a full moon , and when it did allow access, it would dump EVERYTHING after 10 minutes. I have followed all the install procedures to the ""t"", rebooted, reinstalled, and still have problems. If you want a disco light coaster, this is your unit. If you want a good router, get something else."
3,Good Wireless bad WAN router,"Easy enough to set up and the wireless range is definitely superiorto my old linksys wireless router....but.......as a WAN router it does not perform. My 5meg DSL connection was performing at about 0.5meg after installation. Played will all the settings (I am a computer dude) to no avail, so now this is just for my wireless and the old linksys is my WAN router still."
2,not much of an improvement,In my situation I was told a MIMO would help(I live in a granny unit attached to the main house where the dsl is). It has made little improvement over the 2 wire wireless unit that we bought with the sbc service.
5,Works well,"Set-up is a breeze. I had no problems connecting 4 comps and a Xbox 360. Speeds were just as fast as connecting directly to the modem.Some people dont like the blue lights. I think they are cool. If you need a router in your bedroom or dormroom, I would recommend getting something else as lights are bright. However they went well with all the blue lighting on my comp, but I dont sleep in the same room.This was the first netgear router I have used, before I used Linksys, but got tired of ports failing and the incompatability issues I had with non-Linksys usb wireless adapters. The netgear seems to work with everything."
3,"Good range, but went down almost daily","First the good. This router really lives up to its name of RangeMAX. I got a powerful signal all through my house, and even on warm summer days was able to use my laptop outside in my backyard, enjoying the Internet as I heard birds chirping and felt a cool breeze as I sat among my trees.Another good thing: it's not too difficult to set up wireless security. It is more technical than it needs to be, but I was able to eventually figure it out (and you will too).Now the bad. Almost every day, the router went down. I would have to reset it by unplugging it, waiting 60 seconds, and then plugging it back in. It became a real pain after awhile, as you may well imagine."
1,Max Range - weak signal - 70 feet maybe,"I initially installed a Netgear WGT624 Super G 108 mbps at a clients home. The signal was very weak and would lose it's connection. So I bought the NetGear Rangemax WPN824 since it's signal is supposedly so much better. It's not!! The other computer has a NetGear WG311T installed and is maybe 70 feet away from the router. Now I get low, or very low signal, with or without security on. Also cannot change channel from 6 to any other channel to try to improve performance."
3,Netgear RangeMax,I find I have better luck with the B and first G routers. The rangemax (I've tried 2 different ones) both drop the connection constantly. Other routers in the area are a problem but changing the channel did not work either. I usually have to go reset the rangemax to pick it back up. I've gone back to the old G now.
2,Only slightly better than the rest.,"1. Don't be fooled.The Smart 7 built-in antennas is a gimmick to help sell something that doesn't work as well as they say. I purchased one and it can't move through or around walls any better than any other router. The reason is because all 7 antennas are only 4dbi in strength. Regardless of how many antennas you have attached, the strength will ultimately determine the performance.2. No option to upgrade.If you have a 2 or 3 floor house and your connection is at one end of your home (like mine), purchase a router with an external antenna and boost the signal. The internal antennas in the RangMax can't be boosted. And if you think you'll never need to, think about if you're the type of person who uses a laptop outdoors on a patio or balcony."
5,Best Router Yet A++++,I bought this router and i thought i splurged a little but the extra money is well worth it i get a strong fast signal everywhere in my 2 story house with the router in the basement ive previously owned a dlink and linksys and this is the best of them all very easy setup and it worked as soon as i plugged it in i highly recommend buying this router
1,"Worst router in my life, hands down.","I thought my 17+ years of computer experience was lost when I bought this thing, but after reading these reviews, I have to concur, do NOT BUY THIS.1st? I run this machine with two Macs (G5, MacBook Pro) and a Lenovo X61 at home. Both the wireless computers work great. When they actually connect! It seems, every other day, I can either reset the router, or if I'm bored, simply change the wireless encryption password back to what it was, and I can reconnect. I've changed the channels, made it just a b/g router, nothing. Still happens. I don't have a cordless, etc..completely unacceptable.2nd..my Mac G5. It's a WIRED connection and I swear it's on dialup. I get worst download rates than my wireless laptops, it's intermittent on web pages, and it even has the hardest time navigating the router's internal site!Sorry...no more Netgear for me!"
1,I would not buy this,I generally don't write reviews and generally believe the problems people have with items are more related to improper set up than product failures BUT in this case I'm having such poor performance that I feel compelled to write.The router worked great for the first 3 months -- no problems -- but then it started to fail every five minutes. It constantly drops connections. Sometimes it just freezes up and I need to unplug and re-plug it in for it to work.Initially I thought it was my laptop but I've since had three different people over who have all experienced the same problem.It's also not my ISP as I use VOIP and my phone is always active.Hope this helps.
1,The worst,Although this router was easy to configure I have had a terrible experience with it. At one point I was having to reset it every thirty minutes. Netgear technical support is the worst (India). I finally got them to agree to an RMA and had to pay extra for advanced replacement. The replacement router worked correctly for a couple of weeks and now it is doing the same thing that the original one did. I cannot recommend this model of Netgear router and would not buy anything else from them based on extremely poor tech support.
4,Excellent Wireless Connection / Infrequent Disconnects,"This router works exactly as described, for me anyway. Setup was very simple, and I have an ""all-green"" wireless connection from any room at home, with two different notebooks. You can turn off the blue ""disco light"" by a simple press of the button in back, because yes, it IS irritating at night. (Though I must confess that it is a little mesmerizing at first, and you may find yourself looking at the lights for a while!)The only bad thing to say about it is that I DO sometimes (once every few weeks) get a disconnect for web pages ONLY (i.e. other TCP/IP services still function, such as newsgroups). This requires a reboot of the router, and sometimes the DSL modem as well. Prior to the router, this never happened. But I'll deal with the infrequent disconnects to take advantage of the superior wireless range/connection. Not perfect, but quite acceptable."
2,It does the bare minimun,"This router does the bare minimum: it gets internet to your device . . . sometimes.I have been having speed and NAT problems consistently since the purchase of this router. I have verified with my ISP that it is not them.Upgrading to a new firmware is next to impossible; you have to get extremely lucky for it to work.Port forwarding is a joke, and don't even bother trying to set up a static IP.In conclusion: don't waste your money, spend a little more on something better."
1,Router was hard to set-up; then it worked for a week & failed!,This router has all great featchers announced!but it was hard to set-up; then it worked for a week & failed!currently the Router configuration settings are not reachable.I am planning to send it back.
1,Hunk of Junk,"I bought this wireless router and returned it in disgust after two weeks. Not only does it light up like a disco ball constantly, it lost my ISDN consistently forcing me to reboot it as well as my ISDN modem. I've made no formal measurements but its range seems no better than the non-MIMO wireless router I replaced it with. My recommendation: save your money and stay away from this one."
1,doesn't have enough ports.,It did not meet my needs. Didn't have enough ports to plug in computer and bb cable modem.
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT-BUY THE BELKIN ONE,"It's hard to tell what they intended this product to do - the installation procedure is so poorly done that it is almost impossible to install. It's a shame, because the concept is good.Generally anything that claims to have a simple wizard installation is lying.Buy the Belkin version instead."
1,Not Impressed,"Is it just me or are all those 7 antennae connected together into one point, judging by the PCB layout in the attached pictures. This would mean there is no active selection of which antenna is used and no separate channels on separate antennae as claimed?Is this another bogus for the non-initiated poor users like me? 7 blue LEDs are not worth the bucks.I'm sticking with the DI-624M for now. It already has a couple of omnidirectional paddles it can use in case of a flood"
4,Great range,"This covered a few extra dead spots in our house. The install process could be smoother, but it seems to work just fine so far. Internal antennas make hiding it in the dining room a snap, and looks sharp."
1,don't buy refurb,"I bought a refurb WPN824v2 from Tiger Direct via Amazon. I thought I could save a few bucks; ~$20 compared to a Linksys WRT54G2. Sadly, I have gotten ZERO uptime since the unit arrived. It gets stuck during the configuration process and keeps power cycling by itself. I've reset it and tried again many times over a sleepless night. It's obviously not normal behavior so I'm returning the unit. I got an RMA# from Tiger Direct, but they don't pay for return shipping. I'm guessing they also won't refund the original S&H; so now I'm down $15 with a lot of frustration to go with it.Lessons for today: Don't get a refurb router, there's just too much flakiness in these devices that a bad unit can easily get sent back out to some loser (like me). If you insist, check first if the vendor pays for return shipping. And obviously, these refurb Netgear routers must have originally gone out at full price to someone else's grief. I'd just stay away altogether."
1,I am still hoping to get a refund on it,"I have never had so many problems with a router. And I am also experiencing those horrible random disconnects, and it seems the only way is to re-boot the router (I have gone through the agony of speaking to phone support 3-4 times and nothing they've told me works). Also, the router has its on firewall which forces the user to turn off his own firewall in order to use the router, which is a RIDICULOUS condition to have.I regret ever buying this Netgear product, I will actively recommend my friends NOT to buy it, and I am still hoping to get a refund on it."
1,It doesn't work!,This router WILL NOT work if you do big file transfer like BT. It drops the single every 5 miutes wired and wireless!You can only use channel 6 on 108g mode. I already update my firmware to the latest version and nothing improved. It went back to the store yesterday.....
4,Rock Solid performance,"I've been using this router for a couple of weeks, and I love it. the range and signal strength are impressive. No drop-outs or disconnects yet and I use it 24/7 for VOIP and internet access.The annoying blue LED's now have an on/off switch too, so if they annoy you as much as they did me...just turn them off.The setup wizard, is OK, but it is much easier just to set the router up manually using your web browser (PC or Mac...I've used both and it's not a problem)"
1,Just another No wonder product from Netgear ....,This is my third wireless rotuerPros :-Cool LooksGood speedGood RangeCons1)Router Configuration is not stable i.e. when you will have you modem 2)reseted you need to re-install router configuartion.3) Pelase Do not think your internet will be faster than any 8Xg router.4)Unneccessary Fancy LEDs does not help but consume power5)BULKY------------------------------------------------------------------------5) MOST IMP :- If you are buying this REFURBISHED then then Be EXTRA CAREFUL because Netgear will not support Installation process over phone also no manual will be provided. If think you are smart enough to install without CD or Manual or Phone then only BUY it.Somehow I could come out of situation because my another colleage was having installation CD.------------------------------------------------------------------------
3,"Great range but needs frequent ""reboots""","This is the best range and speed that I have seen in a wireless router so far but as many other posts have indicated, the router needs to be frequently unplugged and replugged back in to re-establish the Internet connection. Not sure what is going on there. Maybe Netgear needs to release a firmware update to correct it or something. Also, like many others, the blue lights are a bit annoying. Still, it does provide excellent speed and range in my house."
2,Very Deceptive...,"I was throughly excited to upgrade our netgear 108 WGT624 wireless router to the new ""rangemax"" sure it costed a little more, but it was worth it right? Well it works ok for the most part, except for the fact that it drops the internet connection fairly often, and when attempting to game online the ping will fluctuate very often making it impossible to play and actually have fun.It's not a bad router for someone who is just surfing the web or chatting, but for some reason it fails to route our internet speed correctly.I am also rather dissatisfied with the ""netgear support"" that is so highly spoke of. Unlike most of their customers, I am not a simpleton. And while simply reseting the router would APPEAR to be the magic solution for all of the problems under God's green earth, it's not. I am returning or selling this one to downgrade to our previous WGT624 108, at least it's reliable."
1,"Don't buy this thing, it's junk.","I bought this router from Fry's and paid them to come out and set it up. It worked fine for a day, they came back and got it working again. It quit 31 days later, one day after the cutoff for me to return it. It is impossible to get any help from Netgear unless I pay them $39.99 for help. Their website is useless, their help line just keeps telling me it's my computor. I've tried this thing on 3 computors with the same result.In my opinion Netgear equipment is nothing but junk, their service stinks and Fry's is a rip off store.Don't waste your money on this thing."
1,Do not buy this product,"I should have known not to leave Linksys with their superior support. Do not buy Netgear. Their support is horrible. They will not answer what day it is without trying to force you to buy ""support"" for $100. I was just trying to find out something about updating their firmware which should have been on both their internet site and their instruction manual but was not. Stay way from Netgear products. Companies with this view of customer support should go out of business."
2,Unreliable,"If you're reading through these reviews, it almost seems as though people are using two different products: one that works and one that doesn't. I'd used the same router (Microsoft) for four years and, until the end, I don't remember it clonking out on me once. I've had this product for three months and am constantly having to restart my computer--which is really fun when you're watching an on-line movie and suddenly you have an unscheduled 5-10 minute intermission. It's the most unreliable of anything computer-related I've owned over the past 17 years. I'm glad some seem to feel it's a good product. I won't allow Netgear the opportunity to burn me again."
1,Didn't work,"Received product, no installation CD received, had to go to the website, spent two days trying to get it to work. Ended up going and spending $50 on a new Belkin at Walmart and it works great!!"
4,"YES, you CAN turn off those annoying blue disco lights!","I recently bought this router to replace a lost Linksys wireless router and so far it's working fine with some improved range. I, like about everyone else was TOTALLY annoyed with the blinking blue disco lights.FYI, after a brief search on the internet, I discovered this:""Note: The button on the back of the router is NOT a power switch. It is used only to turn the blue LED lights on the router on and off.""I just assumed the switch in the back of the router was a power switch, but it's not.Thankfully, I can now enjoy the device without have to wear sunglasses at night."
3,"Works for what I bought it for, kinda.","It works great with my Tivo, which is what I bought it for. The range is great, reaching all the way to the other side of the house, and in the back yard. The only problem I'm having is that when the router is connected, the computer doesn't recognize there is an internet connection. I've done everything all the computer geeks I know have suggested, even restoring the hard drive and reinstalling Windows. I'm starting to think that my problem all along has been Comcast having a hissy fit. Maybe they don't allow sharing an internet connection?"
4,Seems to Work Well,"Simple to install (3 minutes), good signal throughout my 4100+SF home. So as long as it continues to work I am happy."
1,Good if You want it for 5-9 months...,"This product is just trash. Do not waste your time or money on it like I did, unfortunately. I liked it at first because it was easy to set up, looked pretty good to me, and worked seamlessly. Until after about 6 months of ownership it starts not connecting to the internet very good because of Netgears dns traffic passing stuff. It has only gotten worse until it would just connect for maybe a few seconds. I had to get rid of and will never buy a netgear product again. Just look on other reviews to learn more about it dying when it even nears a year and the horrible customer support."
4,Generally very pleased,"I upgraded from a Linksys 8.02.11b router to the Netgear 8.02.11g RangeMax range max router for three reasons:1. My Linksys router which I have had for several years was beginning to require very frequent resets.2. My D-link Powerline which I use to access remote area of my house required very frequent resets3. I was hopeful that extended range would enable me to avoid using the Powerline(1) and (2) were successfully corrected, but (3) was not. It's not clear what the extended range capability is but I still need Powerline to go from the router location (my wife's office), to my office which are in opposite ends of my house, although I do get good wireless coverage over most of the house.Set-up instructions on the CD were excellent, and set-up was easy and quick.Also, this is a very good looking unit with the internal antennas,"
2,[4 Star now] Original copy was down more than up.. New one is working perfectly,"I like this wireless router.. when it works. Which unfortunately is only for short stretches at a time. As other reviewers have said, the problem appears related to the wireless functionality. I've spoken to support who claimed to have never heard of this issue before and ultimately agreed that ""it sounds like it is not operating correctly"". Of course I'm out of warranty, so out of luck. This is obviously a design or quality issue, but apparently Netgear doesn't want repeat customers. If it worked as expected I would give this 4 or 5 stars.UPDATE: [4 start now] Work was nice enough to provide wireless setup for my home office and this was my one choice for wireless router. I was a bit apprehensive given the issues w/ the first one, but after 4+ months the 2nd copy I have is working flawlessly. I originally rated this 2 stars, but would up it to 4 based on the replacement router."
2,Netgear meets STARWARS... but the force was not with them....,This is the 1st wireless router which I purchased and I wasnt pleased. I saw a drop in internet speed after installation....and the flickering blue lights were enough to have me banging my head against a wall by the third night. I returned the unit.
1,No installation instructions,"The product arrived quickly, but be advised that if you do not know how to install this router, the product will be of no use to you. Not only are there no instructions provided with the router, the netgear website is also of no use. So, the bottom line is, this product is of no use to me and I will have to return it. The other bad thing, it is not even heavy enough to use as a boat anchor!"
2,Seems to overheat...or something,"Easy setup, and good range.However, the unit seems to overheat or, for whatever reason, will stop working without warning once a month or so. I haven't figured out what causes it, but I have to unplug it for a few minutes and then restart it.Also, the flashing blue lights are INCREDIBLY annoying. I haven't figured out how to shut them off."
1,Worse than the other wireless router,"There is a reason that this router is getting such a poor review; I think they have some serious firmware/design flaw in the WPN824. My router will drop the connection, on the average, once a day, and will reconnect if power-cycled. The netgear tech support guy is a joke. The range is great, but the product is just not ready."
4,Enjoyment,The installation was very easy. The unit performs as promised. I have connected another PC with broadband internet using the PCI card. I also utilize a Dell laptop with built in WiFi. All work well with good speed. I would and will buy more as time passes.
4,Good! Probably too good!,"I bought a whole case of this stuff and gave it away to everyone in my family. They all loved it! Trouble is, once you start, prepare to eat more than you should. Package says 11 servings, but my wife and I had no problem finishing off a box by ourselves! Therein lies the problem, you just can't stop! Plus my wife and I are trying to stay away from products that contain partially hydrogenated oils, and sadly this product has it in the ingredients. So I probably won't be buying it again. But it was fun while it lasted."
4,I like it.A little stale.,"I love the Crunch n Munch Caramel, but getting so many boxes at one time, the popcorn seemed old. It wasn't as easy to chew."
2,Thunder tap,"LB presented an interesting palate of stripped down, neo-punk assaults, but become too ensnared in the aesthetics of pounding minimalism to have most of the songs rise above noisy novelty."
1,zzzzzzzzzzz,"zzzzzzzz because this album puts me to sleep. this is neo-prog. prog sucks. neo-prog sucks. and the thing is tagging this album as neo-prog isnt really even correct as the ruins pulled this same gimmick like twenty years ago - so lightning bolt isnt very progressive at all. if you like rush youll love this. if you like fringe music made by those on the fringe of culture, you will just be bored."
3,Classic Masters A Taste of Honey,Label inside CD case was damaged and was returned for replacement;very satisfied with replacement for CD as well as service from seller.
2,"Cool, funky. Not enough to make it a must have classic.","I bought this CD after seeing them perform on the Midnight Special. I thought the band looked hot and the music was cool. So I wanted to hear more than the song they performed, Boogie Oogie Oogie. The girls have good vocals, actually play instruments, and the music is smooth funk with a disco edge. Not bad, but not in the same league as Donna Summer or The Ohio Players."
2,Good recording if you like the group,"There's only a couple of good songs on this CD, but it's worth it for those alone. That's why I purchased it."
3,bobbyohyeah,YES they were a great band and YES we want to hear their songs remastered to the finest quality but WHY OH WHY would you remaster short versions?? I have to wonder what record company phillistine would remaster disco classics like Boogie Oogie Oogie and Rescue Me as single edits only and not the original extended versions. Collectors of disco music want complete versions. Next time get it right please or dont bother.Three star rating for the greatness of the artists and the budget price of the CD but true fans should question whether it is worth purchasing.
3,honey,"a taste of honey and disco rules...and oh by the way, why are so many words required to review an item, REALLY?"
2,Glad I had a sample!!!!,"I bought the CD for title song,but I was hoping that at least ""2"" other songs would be tolerable, NOT!!!!!Don't waste your money on this CD."
3,100 Missions North: A Fighter Pilot's Story fot the Vatnam War,Well written account by a man who flew the missions and who has the ability to tell a story with candid accuracy and authority. Great reading.
4,An Art Theft Primer,"This is the story of the theft of one of the Edvard Munch ""The Scream"" paintings and the role playing, skullduggery, and negotiations to return the painting to its proper owner. The star of the show is Charley Hill of Scotland Yard's Art Squad. Mr. Hill is ""The Rescue Artist.""During the course of ""The Rescue Artist"" we get the biography of the outrageous Mr. Hill (who is a big blustering character who could probably keep a whole team of psychologists scratching their heads), some of Mr. Hill's past exploits, a recap of famous art thefts of the past, and a ""where are they now"" wrap up.The main thing keeping this from being a five-star book is that ""The Rescue Artist"" is written more like a series of magazine articles that have been strung together which results in much repetition."
3,Informative but tedious at points,"Starting out with a detailed recounting of the 1994 theft of Edvard Munch's iconic painting entitled ""Scream,"" the book ends with its recovery. Sandwiched in the middle is a lumbering tale about Dolnick's hero, a Scotland Yard cop of American British lineage, who specializes in art recovery. Dolnick is a fine writer; his dialogue flows and his descriptions are colorful and paint a good scene. His research and grasp of the art theft world and its motley crew is complete. He enthuses so much over his hero that it weighs down the story to the point where the structure of the book compares to a canoe; sharp at the ends and bulging out in the middle."
3,Writes well but unnecessary obscenities,"Interesting, well written but has a tendency to meander. The author seems compelled to indulge in four letter words which can be distracting."
3,Not as Interesting as the da Vinic Code,"This is an interesting story about art theft, in general, and specifically the theft of Edvard Munch's The Scream. I found the interworkings of undercover police work fascinating. However, it is not as the story of the recovery is not as fascinating."
4,I'll never look at art the same...,"This was a fascinating look at the world of Art theft and those responsible for recovering the masterpieces. While the book's central focus is on the theft and recovery of Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"" (taken from the National Gallery in Oslo, Norway on February 12, 1994), it also managed to pack in true stories of solved and unresolved thefts of some of the worlds most beloved paintings.I have been to some of the world's most renowned museums and have seen original Van Gogh's, Renoir's, DaVinci's and Rembrandt's, etc., and on each occasion the place always seemed so secure. Not so according to this book. Evidently museums are lacking the funds in their budget to beef up security, making it a sitting duck. What's worse is that the criminals, if caught, face very little penalties for stealing these items. It's outrageous if you think about it.Excellent book that was well worth my time."
3,"Interesting, but too long and digressive.","If the reader is interested in a fast pace and action, then this book will not satisfy. The basic story is not a lengthy one. The digressions into background matters provide useful peeks into assorted issues, such as thievery, forgery and the art world, but go on for too long and should have been condensed. I found myself impatient for the story to move forward. The sheer number of delays and digressions bordered on comical."
1,Seriously???,"I was highly disappointed with my purchase. The case was broken and almost every dvd inside was badly scratched. I tried to watch the first dvd, but the subtitles were HORRIBLE. I couldn't even watch a full episode. I have seen this drama before and I really love it, which made this experience even more dissatisfying. Don't buy this item!!! It is such a rip off for the price. You could tell that it was ripped from TV. The station logo is still in the video and the video quality is poor."
3,The Man of the Vineyard,She's funny and lovable and he's handsome and act so natural. What a good combination of characters that seems to be east and west. They are both cute
3,ok,"Areas for improvement are as follows.1. Camera work is very out of focus, but fun to watch once you get past that.2. It may be difficult to go to your dance lesson & request help with move ""x,"" as instructor has made specific sequences for routines and just teaches you the routine as a whole, although some moves are listed on a slide before the sequence begins.3. My dvd was also bought new but came with scratches on it, I'm not sure why.I did end up keeping the dvd, because I felt that the positives outweighed the negatives (though barely)."
1,Disappointed,A really rotten movie! Definitely not for family viewing. I think maybe Amazon needs to give a bit more thorough and informative information about their movies. It was a waste...threw it away.
4,Great story!,"Now this is a cute movie... actresses and actors are excellent...all of them in this movie and play the parts well....this story is so cute and engaging...great for even the men in the family.. it really does give us a glimpse into what can happen so many times in life when we judge people and don't really get to know them. At the same time I definitely could relate to the daughter and how she loves and cares for her mom...not seen much these days in a daughter mother relationship! ""what is headed for a disaster turns into quite a surprise ending and left me glad I purchased the movie...would also make a nice gift for a girlfriend...I do that once in a while and it so surprises my friends...I give a DVD when they are sick and laid up or not having a good day...a precious and fun surprise..."
5,A CHARMING CHRISTMAS ROMANCE,"I really enjoyed this movie, I think it's one of the best Christmas movies that I have watched on Lifetime channel. The writing is funny, the acting is superb (for the most part) and the Christmas backgrond is charming. Also, I have to agree with one of the other reviewers, the actress Joanna Garcia that plays the main characher is under rated, she does a fabulous job. This is one movie that I would watch again!"
2,Another Christmas Romance,Silly and predictable. I was hoping it was going to be better than it was. OK because I was bored but the old couple making out was over done.
4,Enjoyable,"A Very Merry Daughter of the Bride is what I need at the end of a tough week. Joanna Garcia is a good actress, I think a bit under rated. The story line is cute, predictible but a bit choppy per each story line. I am a sucker for romance not matter what season this movie I do recommend."
3,Does the Job,This is handy to have and does the job unless your car battery is totally dead.If thats the case this charger just goes into error mode and your going to have to find an alternate way to jump start your car.
2,"Much good, some holes.","Depending on your needs, and no test prep book can be all things to all people, this could be a good supplement to other instruction. Frankly, none of these are a panacea.The multiple choice section in particular has the basics, but a student preparing for the test would need a lot more walking through the types of questions to be encountered and more practice than this book gives.Otherwise, it is as good as others on the market. You might give an edge to the Cliff's version if you had to choose just one, though having both would be a good plan, if you find these prep books useful.Being widely read in a variety of AP level lit. and writing, writing, writing, with someone to give you good feedback is the best prep."
1,This COULD Work,"On the recommendation of a trusted colleague, I had a set of these purchased for my AP Lit classes. As I work through the book with my students, however, I find the approach workable and the delivery deplorable. There are over a hundred misspellings. The task division, see the poetry analysis section, are random and misleading. On a whole, this book will not help a student."
1,Thermo Loud,"These brake pads squealed worse than my Autozone pads right out of the box. They're so loud, people stare when I back out of a parking space. They were installed per Wagner's specs along with new Wagner brake rotors."
4,"Cheyenne (Lash) & Fuzzy, Legends of Silver Screen & Star","Lash La Rue, when I was 5 years old I recall having watched his serials on Sat. mornings at my Grandma's and thinking Lash and his whip were unique. ""Law of the Lash"" is in my opinion is a great cowboy heroes and villians B&W movie. It has a genuine plot and good ending. ""Lash"" uses his whip wisely instead of a 45 Colt against foes-disarming and capturing them instead. He is in all respects a great actor and this movie contains good actors throughout. ""Fuzzy Jones"" is a funny man and a great sidekick for Lash. Honestly this old cowboy flick is very entertaining and is as good as almost any old or new cowboy movie I have seen. You can say I have rediscovered ""Lash La Rue"" and appreciate his great roles. Lash and Fuzzy, I applaud you and I am one of your greatest fans wherever old actors go. No matter what some reveiwers say about this movie, I urge you to check it out yourself,... I thought it was great, technically and dramatically both."
3,Baby Boomer remembers,"Many baby boomers remember growing up with Hopalong Cassidy, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry and Lash LaRue. Unfortunately this DVD the quality is poor, sad it was not restored, but still brings back fond memories. Only DVD I have seen available of Lash LaRue,"
5,"Breezy, addicting, unique","I read this is a single sitting, and it was, shall we say, the perfect one-night-stand: fun, light, surprising, and intense, ""BaM"" knows when to climax and when to get out-- and, remarkably, it does't leave you feeling guilty afterward.(That was such a satisfying simile that I'm now confident that it must be some sort of cliche. I'm googling things like ""book was like a one night stand"" but find no other uses of the metaphor in its extended form.I'm now googling other permutations of the phrase, but they seem to produce, with few exceptions, unsavory results.Barring further developments, then, I'm claiming the simile as my own.)To be clear: ""Breakfast at Madeline's"" is light enough to be beach/plane/subway reading, but its unique humor and interesting milieu elevate it above the novels you're likely to find at Hudson News.5 enthusiastic stars."
5,"Witty, moving, and outrageously funny--five stars!","Definitely five stars. Breakfast at Madeline's is very witty and grabs you from the first page, but it's also surprisingly moving. The author writes outrageously funny scenes and beautifully drawn character portraits. I don't think I've ever read a mystery where the private eye is a married man with children; it's one of the things that made the book feel so fresh."
1,Not my cup of tea or coffee...,"Okay this is my first review, I struggled to finish this book and I needed to share why. The name dropping drove me insane! At about 20% I started highlighting the celebrity names referenced, only highlighting each the first time it was used, over 70! I could not connect with the main character, basically I thought he was a jerk. Was very surprised that this book had positive reviews, but to each their own... I will not spend any more time reading this author."
1,Disappointed,"Bought this book based on reviews, only read two chapters. Just don't care for this style of writing and found the story boring. I cannot recommend this book."
5,Was the perfect Christmas gift for golfer,"I enjoyed this book so much, that I bought another copy as a gift for a fellow golfer, and although he isn't a big reader, he read this book from beginning to end. That says a lot about it!The book really does help you prepare and improve your golf game.In addition to the book, I gave some reusable hand warmersReusable Hand Pocket Warmer / Heater ""Just Click the Disc"" - 4 (Four) Random Colors - Holiday Gift WrappedThey did come in handy when out playing golf one day, and be reactivitated to use again.It is sometimes hard to choose gifts for 'grown-up' friends, and Amazon made it easy!"
5,Do you want better score in golf?,Zen Golf is the most power teaching about attitude and mental game in the practice of golf. A lot of thanks to Joseph Parent for this gift
4,Finally someone who knows the mental strain of golf,I was struggling to get under my handicap even when I knew I was playing well. This book explains that most golfers suffer in the same way and strategies suggested were a great help.
5,The Point,"What's the point of golf? What are we trying to achieve while we're out there? Simply put, the point is to get the ball in the cup as quickly as possible and enjoy the process. I played a round early this summer, had an awful time, came off the course stressed and feeling bad about my behavior. I was literally hyperventalating over putts. Turns out I scored well. So something was amiss, right? This book has me enjoying the game again. Zen Golf is not a deep and difficult treatise of the deeper meaning of life and golf. It is closer to an instruction manual on how to play better golf and enjoy the game more. It addresses concepts like trust, confidence and positive thinking. I now enjoy those 3-iron punch shots out of the trees. I'm learning to enjoy those 5-footers. Every shot is an opportunity and there's no need for fear or negativity. My ""evil caddie"" seldom comes around, and when he does, I know what to do. This is simply the best golf book I've ever read."
4,Good concepts,The content makes sense at least in writing. It may take a while before noticing improvement or perhaps I need a master as in most zen disciplines. Could have been written in one third of the pages.
4,Excellent resource,I really enjoyed reading this book. I practiced some of the relaxation and focus excersizes on a round of golf and it made me enjoy more the game and shoot a better score.
5,Book,I have just started reading this book and I have enjoyed what I have read so far. I am hoping this will help me with my golf game. I do enjoy ordering from Amazon. The prices are great!! Thank you!!
4,Zen Golf - Helpful?,The concepts and techniques I have applied from Zen Golf have really helped my game and my enjoyment of the game. I have read about half of the book so far. I have been able to avoid multiple hole blow-ups and enjoy the round even when it is not the best.
5,Reducing Inconsistency,"Through both this book and personal work with Dr. Parent the variation in my 18 hole scores has dropped significantly. By applying the PAR approach described in the book, I find that I make many fewer 'very interesting' shots and many more 'yes! that's me' shots. These two ways of first distancing oneself from undesirable shots and connecting oneself with desirable shots are examples of the unique approach taught by Dr. Parent. The book is equally accessible as working with him in person. I expect that I will reread this book many times in the years to come."
5,Focus Focus Focus,not as bad as the title sounds...maybe 4 3/4 stars...trys to get you to focus on what is right and not what will continue to distract you...a guy gave me the book to read that used to throw clubs when he was unhappy...said it changed his whole approach to the game...i havent seen him throw a club in 6 months so i thought I'd try the book too.I never threw clubs and now I figured out why....same indian shoots all the arrows...why be mad at myself..?
3,good to hear things we already know,I enjoyed the book but there is a lot of repatition. Saying the same thing over in different ways. It is always worth while to reinforce things we may already know but dont have in the forefront of our mind. Anything to help my game!
4,"Schizophrenic sludge rock from Lawrence, Kansas","The third album from this Lawrence, Kansas trio, and their first for Crucial Blast, Carnival demonstrates the range of rock Jumbo's Killcrane is capable of providing. From the slow-melting glacier of Tres Futbol del Mono I to to urgent violence of Claxton II, the schizophrenic changes in melody and time of Case in Progress, and the peculiar beauty of Tonymegshi, this CD brings some new approaches to sludge rock. If you are looking for something new and unusual in your heavy music section, you should check this one out."
1,Made with DANGEROUS materials,"Who knew it would be dangerous ordering my niece a bag for Christmas?!I thought it was a joke when she called me and told me there was a warning lable on the bag that said it contains led materials that are known to cause birth defects and cancer! But is was not a joke! It claims you should wash your hands after handling the bag. So, needless to say I think this is crazy and I am unhappy with the product :("
4,A must-read for travelers to Denali park,"Adolph Murie was a naturalist who spent most of his career, and most of this century working in Denali park in Alaska. I heard about him from the tour guides while taking the bus tour through the park. He is their paton saint. The book tells various stories about the various animals Murie studied. It wonderfully captures the sense of that great park and the wildlife that dwells within. After reading his book, I'm inspired to make my next trip to Denali a camping trip where I sit on a high ridge with my binoculars and camera and watch.--Dan Arias"
5,GREAT!,Great Book! My 3 year old loves it. She makes up games and says words and phrases from this book months after we borrowed it from the local library. Great Buy! Everyone needs a copy of this book! I even like it!
3,One Duck Stuck,I just recently started purchasing items on Amazon. This book was from Best Bargain Books. I love the book but it came dirty with spots on the cover and a large pink ink stain on the bottom. This is a problem because I tried to wipe off the ink and got residue. Now the children cannot hold this book to look at it for fear of getting ink / chemicals in the mouth. I will not purchase any more books for children.
4,One Duck Stuck,"I picked up One Duck Stuck because it reminded me of Ducks in Muck but for more advanced readers. The two books use similar rhymes but One Duck Stuck is three times the length and the rhymes border on tongue twisters.The basic plot centers around the stuck duck and her attempts to get out of the muck. She enlists the help of her swamp friends: fish, insects, some birds and a variety of animals. Separately the can't help the duck but what if they work together?"
1,Board Book Edition ONLY - regular edition gets 5 stars,"I checked this book out of the library and my daughter and I loved it. So, I ordered the board book version for her (she's 1 1/2), and found that a good 1/2 of the book is cut out. I'm returning it and getting the regular edition. So, if you like the toungue twisting verses, don't buy the board book."
3,Not full version,I purchased this book for my son to replace his well used copy.I was very disappointed to find out that it is not the full version. This should be mentioned in the item's description. Now I will have to purchase another book[the full version] elsewhere.I would however give the full version a rating of 5 stars.
3,Good,"Often overlooked, the Sylvers were a hot group in the '70s. They were overshadowed by the Jackson 5 (later the Jacksons), yet they made music just as good. They were given the ability to write and produce themselves. Check out Don't Stop Get Off, from the album ""Forever Yours"". It is included here in an extended form that has never appeared on a Sylvers album before. This also has all the hits from the era..Boogie Fever, Hotline, High School Dance. As well as pre-Boogie Fever songs. Hotline still gets me excited to this day. I love the intro with the piano. Boogie Fever is disco at it's best. They could have added a song or two from the Disco Fever album, but that's ok..I still have that on vinyl."
2,WHERE ARE THE REST OF THE HITS ?,"OK CD BUT WHERE IS ""FOOLS PARADISE"" AND "" I WISH THAT I COULD TALK TO YOU"" THESE ARE 2 GREAT SONGS THAT WOULD MAKE THIS CD COMPLETE FOR ME"
4,i couldn't put this book down.,a truly scary tale of the medical establishment gone very wrong. i hope i never get sick and need to go to the hospital again!
5,A scathing account of our countries medical community.,"If nothing else this book should strongly urge the medical community to police it's own. Doctors and nurses are passed from one job to another, just to get them out of the first guys arena. Shame on them."
5,a real page-turner. brilliant!,"This is the most important story of unethical medical practices ever published, and it probably represents standard 'operating' procedure amongst medical administrators. Clearly, a part II is required."
5,The audiobook is great too!,"I echo all the praises of Stewart's writing of this story -- and he reads it as well as he wrote it. I found myself driving around the block several times because I couldn't bear to turn off the car...and, although I've enjoyed other audiobooks, this is the only one I've been tempted to bring in the house to continue playing!!"
5,Like watching a 20-year auto crash,"My wife started reading this first (actually it was a book on CD). She didn't know it was real. When I told her it wasn't fiction she was visibly stunned. You cannot believe what the fraternity of the medical community will do to protect its own... while this whackjob calmly knocks of dozens of people. It is an incredibly well researched, well written account of The System gone nuts. You will be scared, frustrated and educated as to How Things Really Work in medicine, colleges, etc. And you will never look at a(n unfamiliar) doctor the same. A fabulous book... 10 stars."
5,Blind Eye,"Must read for anyone who does Medical Staff Credentials! I would highly recommend this book for anyone who works in a hospital. It can happen anywhere, even in your own hometown!"
4,"Unfortunately, much is true in this book","I know many of the individuals mentioned in the book and I'm sorry to say that while there are some exaggerations, I believe the OSU stuff is pretty accurate"
4,The Devil Himself.,"While written in a rather dry style, James Stewart does a great job researching the life of this truly evil serial killer. The sad thing is that this guy will someday be walking the streets, hopefully not coming to an HMO near you."
4,THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.,"THIS BOOK IS SO PROFOUND AND SO REAL, MR STEWARD HASN'T A CLUE TO HOW TRUE IT IS IN THE REAL WORLD. MY DAUGHTER, I BELIEVE, WAS MURDERED BY A DOCTOR AND IT IS THE ""ALMOST PERFECT MURDER"". THERE IS A NEW BOOK BREWING, I CAN FEEL IT. ESPECIALLY IF MR STEWART WERE TO HEAR MY STORY. HE WRITES SO WELL, I TRIED, AND CAN'T QUITE PUT IT IN WORDS AS HE CAN. WHAT A GIFTED WRITER HE IS. THIS BOOK SHOWS THE EFFORT AND RESEARCH THAT TOWERS THE POLICE AND OTHER INVESTIGATORS. MR STEWART SHOULD BE THE HEAD OF THE CIA, FBI AND ALL LOCAL INFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THEY ALL MIGHT LEARN FROM HIM. THANK YOU"
4,You'll think twice before you check into a hospital!,"Blind Eye is an excellent book and a scary one as well as you read how over and over again a Dr. got away with murder from one hospital to the next! The amazing thing is that each hospital there were signs anyone could see but which the medical establishment in protecting their own decided to ignore. A look into the mind & ""career"" of a killer and the establishment that let him flourish for so long. The killer, Dr. Mike Swango could be released as early as this year from prison, which is one reason why this review is anonymous! This is a excellent book, a real page turner, just don't read it if your recovering in a hospital!"
4,Interesting Information,This is the third copy I have bought over the years because I keep giving them away. I work with credentialing physicians and think anyone who does should read this book.
5,NEVER ENTER A HOSPTIAL THE SAME WAY AGAIN,"It's simple...We all think hospitals, like day-care centers, and police stations, are havens from injury, abuse and an over-all seed of comfort and compassion. Stewart's account of Dr. Swango will scratch one last place off that ""safe"" list. What is more appalling, are all the cover-ups and ""its not my fault"" backlash, that permits murderers to continue their path. A great read, and truly an eye opener."
1,A harsh slam at medical professionals,"While this book is an interesting take on the history of the Swango case, the author (and many of my fellow reviewers) jump to too many conclusions about the poor state of checks and balances in America's hospitals and medical schools. Surely mistakes were made with Swango -- but one should not indict the entire medical community! Many many lives are saved each and every day by tireless medical professionals -- let's give them some respect and thanks."
3,Good but flawed,"I would have given this book 5 stars but for Mr. Stewart's bizarre obsession with the Vietnam war and the Phoenix program, neither of which had anything to do with Dr. Swango. The tortured effort to blame this sicko's childhood woes and later psychopatholgy on his father's military service is a pointless disgrace, and affects the credibility of the rest of the book. Mr. Stewart obviously has no understanding of matters military or the Vietnam War or veterans."
5,good book club book,enjoyed the book and stimulated good book club conversation. This is new that they require more words than I want to say
1,Not Good,"Did not like this at all. Not written very well. Took me forever just to get to the middle of the book, then finally gave up."
5,A Must-Read,This was the first true crime book I have ever read...and I read it twice! James B. Stewart did an incredible job documenting the account of a prolific serial killer that is so bizzare it reads like fiction. Unfortunatly it is all true. I HIGHLY recommend this book. It is well worth your time.
3,"Worth the time to listen to, but read the book, too","The story of Dr. Michael Swango is an interesting one, and this audio book covers the high points of his life and crimes. I would recommend the audio book, but also the printed book for those who are interested in a more in-depth portrayal."
5,Illuminating inside look at the medical establishment...,"It shows the blind veneration that many of us have for doctors in this country. It is a business like any other, and the consumer deserves to be protected from the incompetents in this elite group."
3,Death by misadventure,"Funny, witty in parts, a good read. First half is very well written, second half tries too hard and becomes a parody of itself. Lots of typos in the Kindel version - mostly 'l's and 'I's for 't's. Becomes a bit distracting after a while. The plot is original, the dead-pan delivery of the main character is funny. The story is a bit stilted in parts, like it was written with genuine enthusiasm then the author - Lee Goldberg got a little bored and went a bit crazy himself. All the characters are stereotypes and the cliches come thick and fast. The dog - Boo Boo is just strange - by the end of the book you can definetly see the 'toilet goes into the wall'.Made me laugh..."
3,Too silly!,I enjoyed the last Goldman book so I looked forward to this one but it is too -ntoo illy. I love a book with humor but this is beyond funny.
1,my gun has bullets,one of the most childish attempts at writing that I have read in quite some time. it was hard to think this was anything but bad comedy.
3,Not the best I've read,"Book has some parts that are very funny, but overall it is only an average read. At least the main character isn't as over-written as some of the other characters are. Not a bad book, but not worth more than 3 stars."
3,Tongue in cheek!,"If Lee Goldberg didn't write this with Tongue in Cheek as a nod to the old mystery writers, then I am wrong and it was awful. If he did, it was well done. I found it fun, if a bit predictable. This was my first Lee Goldberg book. I may try a few more to see if they are better(or funnier)."
2,Cheesy,"I purchased this book after reading reviews and being promised hilarity. I also read that Mr Goldburg was teaming up with J. EVANOVICH, i assumed i would be thoroughly entertained. I was wrong! The plot was overdone and not funny at all. I expected more from a writer on the monk show and was greatly disappointed!"
2,Why is this attached to Konrath or Strand?,"First time reading from this author and heard about him through the sample in the book Suckers by Konrath and Strand. The sample seemed good so I gave it a shot. I should have listened to the other reviewers. It was slow, lacked any real humor and should not on any level be compared to Jeff Strand's work which is far superior. I thought since Monk was so good (on Tv) that this would be too. Nope. I regret spending my money on it."
5,man with bogarts face,You don't need to know Bogart to enjoy this movie. I had this on VHS but it broke so I purchaed the DVD and now I can enjoy it a few time a year.Good detective store. Can't beat it fior the money..
2,Bogart's not for everyone...just the cool people.,"Okay, Robert Saachi can't quite act. He just barely passes off looking like Bogart. But everybody else in the movie CAN act; more specifically, act like character archtypes from Raymond Chandler movies.There's Victor Buono as a Sydney Greenstreetoid, Herbert Lom as a Peter Lorreite, and Franco Nero as a rival art collector that colors his world lavender. Olivia Hussey plays the innocent daughter of the guy with the McGuffin (In this case a pair of twin sapphires) and Yvonne DeCarlo...doesn't speak. At all. Odd, really. Don't blink, or you'll miss George Raft in a cameo, only slightly longer than his ""this gun shoots backwards"" role in Casino Royale.It's not quite a parody, and not good enough to be a tribute...more like Bogartmania. Not Bogart, but an incredible simulation.Okay...not that incredible."
2,It's Got Sybil Danning. That's It.,"Not many filmmakers would build an entire movie around the fact that their star resembles a celebrity, but these guys did. When I was a teenager, I loved this movie because it had Sybil Danning doing a belly dance / striptease... even then, aside from that, there wasn't much to recommend it. It's better than jamming a sharp stick in your eye, I guess."
3,Fuzzy Q Jones avenges his twin bother's murder,"Al St John,in a dual-role plays Fuzzy and his twin brother. After his brother is murdered by muraders,Fuzzy joined by Billy Carson(Buster Crabbe)set out on the task of avenging his brother and cleaning up the valley."
1,Pallid attempt at mixing comedy with the Western genre.,"This film is one of a series starring Buster Crabbe as Billy Carson, a rancher who spends a good portion of his time attempting to better the lives of sharecroppers and others who run afoul of varying murderous plotters; in this instance, a friend of Carson is killed and replaced by his twin brother, causing consternation amidst the villains who are convinced that the twin is a vengeful ghost. Most of this short (54 min.) work consists of two small groups of extraordinarily confident horsemen who canter about, chasing and shooting at each other, in essentially non-stop fashion; since most video releases of the work have no titles or credits, one's attention becomes drawn to spotting the interchangeability of the good and bad guys......nothing else here warrants a viewer's concentration."
2,Not So Impressive as it looks,The beggining chapter was promissing until u find yourself alone in the wood. This book could be a pain if u are not familiar with VB or VC++.
2,MS Visual J++ Missing important pieces,"After browsing this book looking for Java compatibility info, I feel Visual J++ developers are trapping themselves on Windows with a polluted version of Java - find out when you get ready to port your Java to other platforms. There also seems to be very little support for EJBs."
4,Works!,"It wasn't the fastest shipping ever, the game was not in the box securely, no book, lots of scratches, etc. But it does work. If a game looks like it will fall out of place then the least you can do is get some scotch tape for it."
4,JAKx,"This game is fun but make sure that you get rid off amo meanwhil pick up new at the same time, well just about sometimes."
4,Good game,"This is a pure skill game, and is not like the normal Jak series.It takes some practice, but overall I and my family played it over several days and very much enjoyed it. It has good replay potential too.Buying different tires when available is well worth it."
4,Awsome Game!!!,This game is one of the best games I have ever played! Especially the online play it is awsome you play with your friend at your house in split screen online! Even if you can't play online it still gets a 4 star rating this game ranks with all the Burnout games. If you love action racing games you will love this one. I didn't like racing games that much but whenI played this game it made me love racing games! You must buy Jak X Combat Racing!
1,Autosave Memory Card Glitch,"Do not buy this game! It has a saving glitch that may make your memory card completely unusable. I bought this game, was effected by the saving glitch, which I didn't know about, & ruined a $30 memory card. Google ""Jak X: Combat Racing save problem"". It can also corrupt all other data on your card. This game should not be sold & be recalled."
4,Ratchet in Jak X!,Ratchet and Clank games are much better than Jak games. I'm only giving this game 4 stars instead of 3 stars because Ratchet is in Jak X.
4,Great Game if You Don't Get One With the Memory Card Glitch,This game is a LOT of fun if you get a copy without the memory glitch. I got a bad copy and it would randomly choose not to save and I would lose all of my progress. It was easy to return it for a refund through Amazon. I ordered a new copy which was fine and now I'm addicted!
2,It's not Mario Kart,"I was hoping this game would be similar to Mario Kart in playing style and camera angles at least. But no.The problem is that the camera angle is so low, you really have no idea what is coming up.You are also pretty restricted to the driving course, unlike Mario Kart.Not recommended."
5,well PROBABLY the most action game i played,this is awesome i love this game i have it and it awesomeu get to shoot missles and anything u want design your car get upgrade buy more parts ANYTHING!!the most action Jak game yet
2,PSP owners-not the last game!,This is actually the last PS2 game there will be no more jak games-except for one-Daxter is the title andit is coming out for none other than the PSP-So PSP owners rejoice. Anyway this game was fun-not the best of the Jak series but by farthe best ending(i won't give it away)the worst thing about thiswas how many times i hit restart-it was horrible
1,Wow,"Wow! I am shocked! This game is so bad, do not listen to the commercials, this game is the worst. First off graphics, badSecond, gameplay, bad Third, totally a Mario Kart Rip OFF!!!and don't go off and buy Crash Tag Team Racing cuz its nothing like the commercial. If you are looking for a real game, get Full Auto, Don't have an Xbox 360 get Need For Speed Most Wanted."
3,Sick and twisted voodoo Asian style,"Tons of nudity,a corpse and weird gross rituals.Forget the plot you can read that in the editorial review from Amazon.If you like horror movies about unfaithful wives, possesion,and the dead then check this Chinese gore out.If you like sleaze then you should be satisfied.Just don't expect The Exorcist.Do expect nastiness and a silly,goofy,laughable goodtime worth watching at least once."
5,AWESOME!,I have this DVD but only use Kendell Hogan's workout. The others were too complicated to follow. Kendell's workout is easy to follow and has a good mix of upbeat cardio and strengthening exercises. My butt is rounder because of the squats and my legs feel stronger because of the lunges. Can't be beat!
5,Good buy!,This is a great DVD! Quick and efficient workouts that are about 30 minutes each (including cool-downs). The first 2 workouts are cardio based and the last 3 are a mix of cardio/strngth training.
2,what is going on?,"I remember this video from exercise tv. The reason why I ordered it is the workout from violet zaki, which is excellent of course. Unfornately I had to purchase the whole tape just to get to her. The rest of the trainers were terrible. Did they actually think they were working someone out? Violet's was the hardest. All of the others were very easy and unchallenging. Now if you are a beginner, then this workout is for you; but if you are intermediate to advanced, then skip this tape."
4,Great variety!,I really like this dvd for 1 big reason: Variety! I don't have to do the same workout or see the same trainer day in and day out - that really beats my biggest problem - boredom.All of the trainers are fun and most of the workouts have one person (there are 4 in the background) doing a lower impact version of the moves. Some of the choreography can be tricky and take a few times through to pick up - but that is part of the challenge.This is my new favorite cardio dvd and I use it 2 times a week.
3,Not my favorite,I expected it to be more challenging. The only segment I even remotely liked was Violet Zaki. I was disappointed.
2,"This is a poor indication of the group's quality,","though not their fault. The production of the DVD is almost amatuerish. The visuals are impeccable, but when you buy a music DVD, you hope for quality of sound as well. This sound seems to have been recorded using a microphone hung in the middle of the auditorium. Frequently, the vocals are uninteligible, drowned out by the back-up group. If you have ever seen them in concert, you know what a treat the experience is. In this case, however, the effort of the group is evident but the results of the recording are disappointing at best."
5,"What A Concert, What A Vocal Group!","I have been a Manhattan Transfer fan ever since I first heard them sing ""Operator"" and have nearly everthing they have recorded. After searching nearly every store, web site, etc trying to find a video of a ""Transfer"" concert, what a joy it was to come across this DVD recorded during their tour of Tokyo. It was recorded in 1986 and contains many songs from the ""Vocalese"" release as well as favorites from their career. If you have thought that the Manhattan Transfer was just a novelty act, you owe yourself a look at this! By the way, this was the 1st DVD I purchased. Even casual fans need to treat themselves to this concert! Janis Siegel rocks the house with her lead vocals on ""Boy From New York City"". These folks are the best at what they do!"
5,RAZOR ROCKS!!!!!!,"What a cool idea to have a ghost slaying guitar! The futuristic setting and the flashbacks to the 20th and early 21st Centuries are right on. I found myself trying to be a part of the whole story. The Savages are such real characters. Bayou trying to please his father and Razor, the ghost ass kicker, always ready for the challenge. The song references brought back many great memories and the humor throughout the book had me reading with a smile on my face. Hopefully, there will be more of the Savage family coming!"
5,The Resurrection of Bayou Savage : Guitar Ghost Fighter,"Captivating story that pulls magic, science, music and psychic phenomenon together in true Rock 'n' Roll style. Great reading!! Looking forward to the next book!!"
3,Different than a premium sandalwood,"Sometimes the simple things brighten our day. In this case, the right soap can invigorate a shower and get the day off to a more pleasant start. Having discovered the joy of a premium French milled sandalwood soap, I searched out Amazon to try as many as I could.First things first, Mysore does not qualify as a ""premium"" french milled soap. It does not have the luxurious scent of a premium sandalwood soap. It's scent is very strong and the lather feels more like Dove. The strength of the scent was most surprising. We have a bar in the spare bathroom. The shower is seldom used, yet the scent of the soap is noticeable on walking into the room and actually pleasant.Not sure I would recommend one way or the other on this soap. I can't rave about it, but I can't knock it either. I'll just say we prefer the Casswell Massey soaps."
3,Mysore Sandalwood Soap,"I bought a case of this soap. It is sold at a very reasonable price. It's scent is very pleasant -- and very strong. The problem is that it has so much incense smell in it that I cannot smell the sandalwood. While it is a good value for the money, I am unlikely to buy it again. I like to smell the sandalwood, and will go back to Yardley or another of the (expensive) soaps that simply smell like sandalwood. However, I bought so much that I need (a) to give it away, or (b) wait about a year until I use it up."
5,Good for body and soul,"Years ago, I used to buy Mysore Sandalwood soup. I had forgotten how it scented all my little apartment with a clean but not perfumy scent. Recently I rediscovered the soap again at Amazon. Most soap is made of lard and lye - ugh! This one is made with sandalwood oil only, and Ayurveda medicine recommends it for your skin. The scent of it clears your mood and makes for a healthy feeling. Good for body and soul!"
5,Cool Historical Vignettes of a Legendary SF Club,"A collage of entertaining interviews with Chatterbox staff and regulars, vintage video and stills from the club, and audio tracks of some of the bands that played there in the day. Funny stories of hard-rocking days gone by, told by colorful folks who lived them. A vivid glimpse into late-80s San Francisco underground culture, and a time that many would say was a better time.Chatterbox was the 80s club that preceded the 1990s Chameleon, which in turn morphed into the current 21st century bar named Amnesia which occupies the same space on Valencia. You can still go to the room where the Chatterbox was, yet it isn't there, how odd."
5,Author Comment,"Dear Reader,Please take seriously only those reviews that are signed. It is very easy for people to make false statements and personal attacks under the cover of anonymity. Thank you.Doug Valentine"
1,Pure unadulterated barnyard brown,"To start with, the SEAL Mr. Valentine interviewed in this book never existed. There has never been an Elton Manzione who graduated from the Navy's Special Warfare Training, UDT/R or BUD/S. This combined with the fact that the Navy only sent their senior people who had time in country to work with the Phoenix Program. Either Valentine made this up or relied on sources that were pretty shaky. Do your homework better next time."
1,Mostly fantasy substantiated by proven frauds with an agenda,"Once you know that Manzione is a verified fraud everthing that follows is discredited. A lot of facts mixed with a lot of fiction. It is unfortunate that this trash has been used as reference in many bibliographies. ""Phouc Ninh PRU, Tay Ninh Province, Aug-Dec 1966"". My OER (Officer Efficiency Report) evaluating my responsibilities and performance as a PRU Advisor is unclassified-never was."
1,Disappointing,"The author's intent is very obvious, however, his structure is too detailed in facts that clouded the issues by making a boring and difficult read. The flow and continuity were just not there. I am quite surprised the editor did not have a field day rewriting much of his work."
1,Just one question ....,"One reviewer writes: ""It is a sad but telling fact that the CIA's secret supporters have managed to suppress this book""...Hmmm. If the book is ""suppressed,"" then why can you buy it on Amazon? (In fact, a REPRINT of the original version!)Maybe the answer is in my motto: never trust anyone, esp. an ""author,"" who talks about himself in the third person. :)"
1,What about the Earth Religions??,"I wish books like this would stop claiming to represent the complete religious views of humanity. By ignoring the highly sophisticated belief and religious systems of countless earth-connected Indigenous Cultures, not to mention the fastest-growing religion on the planet today - Paganism, it complies with the devious principles of dominance and control. This book is not a comprehensive attempt to address the ""truth that unites all humankind"" that's for sure. There are countless other paths to the Sacred that are not acknowledged in this book. What about the millions that don't subscribe to the eight major monotheistic organized religions - where are Their Voices???"
4,gripping,A fascinating story that you want to read start to finish in 1 go. It also gives more understanding (in the sense of knowledge)of the minds and motivations of extremists.
1,Fake,"Under the auspices of ""inside information"" on the workings of the Jihad, this book is a piece of subjective propaganda - not all that cleverly camouflaged - an should be tagged as such."
4,Look Into the Other Side,"This book does a great job explaining the view from the other side - instead of seeing a documentary by a filmmaker who lived with Al Qaeda for a short time, the author actually lived the life of a member of Al Qaeda, demonstrating the importance of human intelligence in the war on terror - and how some seemingly minor actions taken by western intelligence agencies can destroy that intelligence and understanding of terror groups."
4,Good read,I really couldn't put this book down. I had to force myself to put it down and go to bed. Even passed it off to another friend for him to read. This book always left me wanting to know what happens next.
3,"Not reliable, but a good story","Wow......what a story. But I find the story little reliable though there is a lot of hard fact in it. I mean, is this guy really a mujahedin MI6 ""James bond"" super agent? Smarter than the real deal?Omar Nasiri very proudly describes all the things he can do and learned. And he can do everything, from being the perfect spy to mix his own Semtex. Solve complex mathematic formulas and drive a tank!!!! He knows about architectural and historical things as well when he's on ""sightseeing"" in Istanbul.....naaaa.What also strikes me is that lots of the information in this story, is very similar to things one can find on the internet. So just maybe the author collected information from newspapers, the internet and from persons who know ""something"" and led his imagination do the rest. I don't know. Read it and judge for yourself."
3,a little weird...,"i thought this song was okay, until it got to the ""money,money,money"" part, it reminds me of The Apprentice, and then it reminds me of Donald Trump, not a good vision to have when listening to a song abt 'Bad Ass Strippa' *shudder*other than that, this is rather blah, i think it needs something else, she sounds like she's doing backing vocals"
4,Something fresh from the UK!,"This song is already a smash in England and hopefully will get a US release. It's produced by Timbaland (of Missy Elliott fame) and will get you dancing the moment it starts. There are a few interesting samples mixed in - the song starts with a sample from the beginning of Al B. Sure's 1989 hit ""Misunderstanding"" and settles down into a thumping groove. I'm anxious to hear more from Jentina. Worth picking up!"
3,A Christian Focus,"The authors evaluate fantasy from a Christian perspective. While they have interesting things to say, it is a rather narrow focus. For instance they judge Le Guin's The Wizard of Earthsea series to be morally ambivalent, whereas many readers would recognize her as presenting a Taoist point of view. Judging the worth of a work of fantasy this way, to me, does not shed much light on the relevance of the genre to our modern society as a whole. It also misses or misconstrues many works that can not be read favorably from their world view. The authors are not necessarily close minded toward other religions. But their focus generally detracts from this book's broader appeal."
1,"Inaccurate in Homeric section, so perhaps elsewhere too","review written by the person I bought this book for.I was excited to receive this book as a present, as I teach subjects on mythology and fairy tales, and enjoy the Harry Potter books. However, I was very disappointed when I got to the section on Homer, as it contains a large number of basic errors about the plots of the two epics, especially the Odyssey. These are mistakes that I would be annoyed to find in my students' essays, and would remark to them that it they seemed not to have actually read the epics, or at least not recently. I haven't finished the book yet, but my confidence in the statements made by these authors in other areas has been greatly shaken."
2,Tacked-on HP,"I've only read the last couple of chapters of this book, but my advice is, don't buy it for the Harry Potter part. There are a few pages on HP, and they say things everyone has said before by John Granger and others. John Granger's books are hard to follow at times, but he really engages with the HP books in a way this book doesn't.I also read the His Dark Materials chapter which seemed biased against Pullman, but I need to read the rest of the book to rate it fairly."
1,Terribly Disappointed,"This book, which was probably very good in the 1970's is woefully lacking in currently applicable information. Too much of the text is taken up by documenting projects that failed. A far better book on hydroponics, and worth every penny of the additional $8 cost, is ""How-to Hydroponics, Fourth Edition"" by Keith Roberto. While this book is supposedly updated as of 1999, it barely scrapes the surface of current hydroponic technology."
3,shame,"Very well organized, structured, etc, etc.... but, can you believe the illustrations of posters and printed examples in this book have NO INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACTUAL SIZE of them????? What happened??? Were all designers doing postcards and stamps before our time???The author is also very biased, which I guess is the only way to go when you have to pick what to include in such an ambitious work. When talking about Malevich's black square, to fail to mention that he had positioned this painting in the corner of the room where orthodox icons go in houses, is quite decontextualizing."
4,Michigan Vacation Guide,"My family has used this several times, discovered some favorite places to visit, like Beaver Island. We liked it so much we bought some land there!"
1,I have a better recommendation,"For this anthology, Dr. Doniger chose some of the more well-known hymns from the Rigveda, the ones that many Indian sages have commented on. In that sense, for those who are familiar with this subject, this book does not add anything new. This book also has many serious faults. For example, I find the translation of Purusha as Man (even with capital M) as disrespectful and improper. The RigVeda does NOT say that Man is his own creator. Of course, why would that bother Dr. Doniger?If anyone wants to read a proper anthology of the RigVeda, I recommend the english rendition of a Sanskrit anthological (121 hymns) work of T.V. Kapali Sastry by Prof. R.L. Kashyap. This book is available in the US."
1,Gets lost in the foliage,"If the Rigveda is a tree with a grand plan, Wendy Doniger doesn't know it. Her translation has a Freudian slant that does violence to the vision of the Vedic hymnmakers."
2,Difficult to grasp,"I know nothing about the Rig Veda outside this book so cannot comment on whether the hymns selected or the translation were appropriate. However, the lack of introductory material means that each hymn is followed by a lengthy notes section. Flipping backward and forward detracts from the fluidity and understanding of the text. The hymns are pregnant with symbolism but if it's introduced in the notes on an as-you-go basis it isn't absorbed.Some of the shorter hymns I found read quite well so the translation isn't all bad. Furthermore, it chooses to present some of the more ""mundane"" aspects of life during the time of the Rig Veda, which I found interesting.Overall, there are probably far better translations but this one isn't all bad."
1,The Indian Elephant,Ms. Doniger seems to be biased against the Vedic religion (aka Hinduism) which can be easily gleaned by a careful reader of this work. The author also has hidden agenda in her portrayal of the Hindu religion by negative stereo-typing.Any Westerner wanting to know about the Rig veda is well advised to ignore this shananigan. The author suffers from the same syndrome as the 6 blind men trying to describe an elephant by just touching it.Ms. Doniger would never understand as she has preconceived notions about other religions :-(
2,Yard Sale Shabby,"I own this lighting set.Must say I was somewhat dissapointed when it arrived. It looks no better than what I can purchase at a local yard sale. If you like shabby chic, it will work for you.It does look much different in the photo than it does in real life.Does not work for me in my home at all. Will try to figure out someone to give it to that likes this type of style, or donate it to Goodwill."
4,As Advertised,Couldn't find the brushes anymore at local stores. Thanks for stocking them. Product came quickly and it was just what I wanted. Thanks again.
4,Great Brush,This brush does not exactly fit onto my sonicare. They have made so many newer ones. It still does the job just as good.
3,small brush heads,"These ""Ultra"" compact heads are not as effective as the full size heads. However they do all for better coverage in the back of the teeth so there is a trade off here. they're ""OK"" for the money but I'd probably look for the standard size before i would buy this size again."
5,"Hey, Someone Has Them In-Stock!","I was very happy to find the standard size replacement heads here on Amazon, and at a very reasonable price. I often have trouble finding these in my local stores -- they always seem to be out of stock. Replacing the heads on the Sonicare toothbrush is super-easy... so ahead and buy a set of these, your teeth will thank you!"
5,Replacement brushes,Make sure you order more than one set. You will not want to run out. My dentist has been very happy with my chech ups since I have been using this brush!
5,Accept no substitutes,"The bottom line: if your toothbrush is a Sonicare Advance, you are going to need replacement brush heads and that's reality. Both of my kids are using Advance and they should be replaced at lest every six months.Like most of anything that's a Sonicare brand (there are exceptions) these are good quality products that last for the six months of twice-a-day daily use, as advertised. After that, you will need new brushes and Amazon has them while most other stores don't.Life is good, smile :)"
4,Compact heads really small,"We've had our sonicare for years. This is the first time we tried the compact heads. They are pretty small and we're not sure we'll buy them again, may switch back to the full size, depends on how we feel about them in another 4 months!"
1,Unhappy,"I had signed up for purchases every six months with free shipping. I was charged shipping for my last order and did not realize that shipping was being charged till I received my order. This was a classic ""bait and switch"" and I cancelled my subscription because of this."
2,sonicare Advance,You did not make clearThat the heads came in compact and regular sizes . I recieved the compact size and am very unhappy with them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am a full grown adult male.
1,Has no battery life!,"I know that the Advance series is becoming obsolete, but I assumed that as long as I could get the brush heads, I could continue to use it since it still ""works"". The problem is that none of the replacement heads that I have purchased in the last year will stay charged longer than one or two uses. Save your money and invest in a new base - obviously the brush heads on the market are old."
2,Poor service,"Product ordered and not received when promised. Re ordered and charged for 2 day shiping, received 15 days later.both shipments were not the product ordered they were returned with request to credit my charge card to date this has not happened."
5,Never Go To the Dentist Again!,"When I went to the dentist six months ago I got great comments. My teeth had been very well taken care of just by daily routine. My doctor said the only bad thing I had going for me was stains, which could not be removed by brushing alone. She recommended I try this product to get rid of that problem. I did. It works great. I have bright, white teeth and don't have to go to the dentist until something major occures."
3,Not as the original ones,"The brush head is lot smaller than the original one, the advertised size is fine for kids but little too small for adults. I have been using the same brand for years and this is my first time I have seen this small size. I believe Philips Sonicare don't produce the original size any more (regular size), what a shame.."
2,Philips Sonicare Advance Replacement,"The brushes on this product have decreased by half. It is more proportioned to a single tooth than the brushes of a standard toothbrush. The price is now double and the product half in size. Very disappointing! I'll be looking for another electric toothbrush when these replacements wear out (which should be, also, quicker than before)."
4,"Philips Sonicare Advance HX4012 Compact Replacement a-Series Compact Brush Head, Colors May Vary (2 Brush Heads)","These brush heads were too small, I guess I did not see world ""compact"", otherwise - very happy with the product."
4,Sonicare Brush Heads,"My periodontist insists on this particular model, even if it isn't the latest Sonicare type, because of its compact brush size - he says at regular exams he can tell which brush head his patients are using, this one being the most effective. I'd give this item a five star rating if only it weren't so expensive."
2,Too Delicate,"I managed to break this lamp somehow. It looks pretty, worked great for the first month, then I twisted the switch too far the wrong way and it died. But I loved it right up until that point. So be gentle if you buy it."
1,Not what I expected - does not work,"I have a 15"" dell flat screen, and was looking for a privacy screen that would fit and protect my information. The Clamps don't stretch far enough to slide onto the screen.AND it doesn't protect any of the information on my screen. Anyone who walks by can still see perfectly fine. Its more of a glare or dust guard. Not sure how this qualifies as a privacy filter at all."
3,Decorative Painting on Glass Tile & China,Nothing very exciting. No inspiration. It does give some instruction so you can do your own thing.here's 3 words
4,Good book,"I cannot say how this book compares to others of its kind, but on an absolute scale, it works very well. There are a lot of suggestions for practical exercises as well as sample training plans for different levels which specify which exercises (laps, bouldering circuits, ...) you should be able to perform at which climbing grade to achieve your goal. All this makes it very valuable in practice.I am hesitating to give five stars only because the DVD I got has some technical issues, and because I am not sure how good the best (i.e., 5-star) book on this topic is."
1,No DVD!,"Stay away from the Kindle edition: despite the cover text & book blurb you'll not get the DVD with the purchase, just the text."
5,The real hurt of things,"Hart D. Fisher is an amazing man. Hard to contemplate that at one time, he was happy. I find myself strangely drawn to his dark, melodic verse. Pity we can't all feel the torment that rips through his words like so many daggers of ice. I desperately need to read the first book; any endeavor by Fisher will recieve warm praise from me. I can't sleep after reading his work; I stay awake, waiting for the demons of poetry to claw at my throat and suck my life's breath."
4,"Easy setup, takes time to understand","I bought this for a small boat I have. Its very easy to set up on the boat, and begin. Essentially, its just add batteries. However, you really need to read the directions and sit in your boat for a while to get used to the unit. It took a while for me to get out of demo mode, and once I did, I was OK. It looks very easy to work with, and after about an hour, I figured it out and all went well."
5,Easily the best I've read on this pivotal battle!,"Perhaps the definitive account of Midway. An absolutely masterful combination of historical research and gripping personal testimony. This one is made all the more interesting from its Japanese perspective. Fuchida's account of Akagi's destruction (with him on board!) reveals the horror of America's dive bombing attack and the fury of high explosives. This one is a must read! For more reviews see the ""WWII Aviation Booklist"" http://www.ampsc.com/~prophet/booklist.htm"
4,A must read for serious military history fans.,"A monumental work, in light of the fact that this is from the Japanese perspective. The book also details the essential events from Pearl Harbour leading to the Battle of Midway. Fuchida-san, being a key figure in Japanese carrier operations brings a unique first hand account whilst providing valuable strategic conclusions and explanations for the Japanese defeat."
4,Better to see Japanese side's story rather the US side's,"Why? This was a battle organized by the Japanese admirals. They chose the time & place. Yet, they suffered from a huge loss because of some false assumptions. US job was decoded the Japanese's code and planed an ambush, as Jack Flecther put it, 'Strike, repeat Strike'. The book tell the story of the whole Japanese preparation/psychology before/during/after the in a really terse and yet informative way. The reasons for a 4 stars instead of a 5 stars from me are:1. It doesn't has as much detail map of the battle as some of the other books has. Hence, it is difficult to track what happen to different task forces.2. It doesn't cover the Japanese naval warfare's design & tactics as detail as I hoped. Fortunely, these topics are covered by another book, Kaigun, by the same publisher, Naval Institute."
1,Mitsuo Fuchida was a liar...,"As a Navy brat who grew up in the postwar era, Midway was a big deal. Of course, I read and enjoyed Fuchida's book. However, I recently finished reading ""Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway"" by Jonathan Parshall. In this book, it's clearly demonstrated that Fuchida did more than shade the truth. He lied in such a way to push blame upon others for Japan's defeat at Midway. For example, Fuchida makes the claim that the Japanese were getting ready to launch their strike just at the time the American SBDs dive bombed their carriers. Parshall shows how that was impossible given both Japanese carrier practice and the logs of flight activity. Sadly, Fuchida's book has enjoyed an unwarranted popularily due to our ignorance of Japanese documents and our lack of desire to question something that fits right into our own prejudices.The Japanese historians consider Fuchida to be a liar. It's time that we do the same."
4,How not to win a naval engagement.,"I put this book on my reading list after reading Shattered Sword. I wanted to compare the detailsof events presented by both sides. I was not disappointed. Mitsuo Fuchida and co author Masatake Okumiyaspare no criticism of the Japanese naval leaders and their approach to the planing and carrying out ofthe Midway mission. I become more aware of the concept of the ""Victory Disease"" that theJapanese naval personnel were alleged to be infected with which lead to their over confidence and eventualdefeat at Midway. For those that have an interest in the Battle of Midway, this is a must read."
4,Less than my expectations,A fine book with lots of good information written in readable prose. I was hoping to learn more intimate details on how the Japanese from their point of view lost the battle. That is is included but not to the detail I hoped for. I would recommend the book to anyone that studies events of war.
1,OMG...what is this dreck?,"imagine if you will an alternate universe where evil dust bunnies have trapped you in a perverse dungeon of leftover moldy carpet remnants from some cheap forever-going-out-of-business sale, and no decent colors or styles or weaves and no Anso-V nylon to protect any part of your body, and especially your ears, from the rotting onslaught of these castaway wet, discolored, rancid flotsam and jetsam pretending to be underfoot but actually creeping up on your auditory system at the most inconvenient and disturbing hours like when your trying to get some sleep since you've been hungover from some random bar hopping of 100% grain alcohol and tuna-onion subs revisiting both orifices simultaneously and you'll then get some idea of this CD."
1,too expensive,The price of this item is way too expensive for folks living in an apartment with limited space. It would be cheaper to remove cabinets and install regular sized stove.
5,Just as fun at 36 years old as it was at 15 years old,"I am enjoying playing this game with my 9 and 7 year old. It brings back a lot of funny childhood memories and with a sound track that my 7 year old began to hum 2 minutes into the game, I must say that this game is what dreams are made of!"
2,This is not a standard All-Clad Product - Made in China,The Roti models are not made with a three-ply construction with an aluminum core and magnetic stainless exterior. The Roti models are made in China (not America like the rest of the All Clad pots and pans) out of a non-magnetized stainless steel. They're not designed for use on induction or conventional stove tops (a common step in the preparation of gravy).A curiousity: The All Clad Web site doesn't appear to list the Roti models. I couldn't find it under any category. This model is an orphan.
1,Stay away cheap junk not tri-ply even though you will see it is called tri-ply some places,"Unfortunately I bought one of these pans because I read this expensive roaster was a tri-ply. It is not and if you put it in a hot oven it warps like crazy. Once I realized that this was not the All-Clad that I was used to I contacted All-Clad. I have an entire kitchen full of All-Clad and they told me to stuff it. So that will be the last ""All-Clad"" I will ever purchase. There are many alternatives which are multi-ply at a considerably lower cost. As All-Clad does not stand behind their merchandise there is hardly any benefit in buying their products. Read the Cook's Magazine review about this pan if you have any doubts."
3,Not the best roaster for $200,"I recently checked out the All-Clad roaster at Bed Bath & Beyond and decided against it. Three design flaws turned me away from it:1) It's not tri-ply, only stainless steel.2) It can't be used on an induction range (I don't own an induction range, but I like to plan for the future).3) It's not flat on the bottom (raised center), so it will be difficult to use to make gravy.After a little research, I bought the Mauviel M'cook 1830 large roasting pan. It's slightly smaller than the large All-Clad, but it has five-ply construction, can be used on any range and is completely flat on the bottom. It's a beautiful piece of cookware with a lifetime warranty. Plus it's made in France, not China (like the All-Clad).I bought mine from [...] and it came with a rack included for $200."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I shouldn't have assumed that this would be cladded. How can a company like All Clad produce a $160 roasting pan without a sandwiched layer of aluminum to distribute the heat evenly. This is worthless for pan gravy! It is nothing more than a handled serving tray as far as I'm concerned, I am better off with an $30 aluminum roasting pan from a restaurant supply store. What an overrated piece of junk, for the price there is much better out there... I am disgusted by the arrogance of All Clad peddling this garbage!"
1,Manufactering Problems,"I'm guessing the reason why Amazon is pulling this item is the non-stick rack is not oven-proof, and melts at roasting temperature. I purchased mine at Williams-Sonoma. The bottom of the rack melted onto the pan (Thanksgiving night). If they have the slightly more expensive roaster with the all stainless rack, I would recommend that item highly. The pan itself is great."
1,Misrepresented,"All-Clad Stainless Roasting Pan with Rack and Turkey ForksThis is a ROTI pan (not in title). Contrary to product description, it is NOT ""3-ply bonded"" stainless steel and aluminum. Now I understand the reviews are referring to this exact item I just received, not another All-Clad roaster. At this point, it has to be understood that the description is intentionally misleading. I am angry that my time was wasted. I was duped. I rate this zero stars. Will never order from this retailer again."
2,Not For Me,"Bought this pan a few yrs ago and have been using it for our Thanksgiving turkey-attempting to give it a fair shake. It is now the night before Thanksgiving and I have hauled out my old inexpensive roaster, the one which looks like the Granite Ware roaster listed on Amazon(like my mom's old roaster but not has heavy). Using the All-Clad seemed to produce less juice for the all critical gravy making, and the gravy making was far more difficult in the All Clad. Been roasting turkeys for over 25 yrs and here I am pulling out the inexpensive one & feeling as tho I had wasted almost $300.This All Clad roaster's quality is not like my other All-Clad's pots & pans-not nearly as heavy or even ""cooking""(when I fought with it during gravy making on top of the burners). The only thing positive I can say about is, the handle placement ( french roaster design) is excellent. Save your money and get a better pan- until All Clad can come up with a better roaster(heavy bottom).Happy TG!"
2,For Anthony Hopkins fans only,"Anthony Hopkins is wonderful, with his many-faceted portayal of a tortured lawyer with wife problems.Other than his superb performance, this production is a big yawn."
1,No Actual Instruction in these DVDs- two hour infomercial,"Undoubtedly a good teaching system in live sessions.This DVD set is a two hour INFOMERCIAL for their training system.They demonstrate their range of training topics and moves 100% with kids but NO actual instruction on HOW to do each move.I was very disappointed and more importantly my daughter was bored.Again, there is NO COERVER coaching or instruction provided on these DVDs - only rapid fire vide examples of their training drills.I am very disappointed at the very inaccurate review I read that 5 star recommended this as a teaching video."
2,Slow read!!,"I had to stop reading this book because it was boring and too slow for me. I like to read books that grab you at the first page and will not let you go til the end. Something you don't want to put down for any reason. Hate to say it but I was thinking of things to do so I would not have to read this book!! I kept trying to read it but finally I gave up and started reading the Resident Evil series which I could not put down now that's better. You want a romance book you don't want to put down try Skye O' malley, Sheik, Eternity by Maggie Shayne, The Last Mermaid by Shana Abe, Bewitching by Jill Barnett, so many others to pass the time by !! Plus the tutors were named Alpha, Gamma, Beta come on!!! Let's get original!"
4,Disturbing,"Very good acting by all. It almost seems a little too real at times. Be forewarned, some scenes are very difficult to watch."
5,Lisa B,VERY IMPRESSIVE! Much of the information in this documentary just stunned me to no end in a great way! Highly recommended!
2,very poor production quality,"I am both a believer in scripture and a fan of archeology but this film is beyond the pale. The producers draw spurious conclusions and take enormous leaps of logic. If you are interested in watching a documentary about real archeology in the Holy Land, look elsewhere."
2,The king of California,"This book is way too long and somewhat redundant and boring. The basic story is good, but the author takes too much time and too many pages to tell it."
4,Microcontroller programming,"Pretty good overall. Contains more assembly language than most books like this, which is why I bought it. I would recommend this others. I use it as a reference or refresher."
1,A disorganized mishmosh; a waste of time and effort.,"After reading the earlier, excellent book in this series on Basic Stamps, I was hoping to find another book of similar quality to help me delve into the world of PICs. I am, to say the least, very disappointed. I'm a senior level software engineer with a good hardware background, but I found this book to be so unclear as to be nearly unreadable. There is little logical progression in building the reader's conceptualizations. Facts are introduced seemingly at random. Irrelevant ideas are gratuitously tossed in, only to be rescinded shortly after. I looked in vain for a chapter that lived up to its title, and felt disappointed with each and every one. There isn't even an appendix listing the processor's instruction set! There's no way I could program a PIC after reading this book, and I'm almost as ignorant about them as before. All in all, a very frustrating experience."
3,Not a good book for beginners,This is definately not a book for beginners. There is a lack of order and some things are repeated a couple times. Some basic concepts aren't explained and without them just about everything else dosen't make much sense. If you still decide to buy it I would recommend downloading the datasheets from Microchip and read those before you start the book; and also finding a short description of the commands. One good thing is that he will answer your emails and answer your questions
2,Review: Programming and Customizing the PIC,"The book is full of good information but it is also full of way too much fluff.Many of Myke's figures are difficult to follow and the text describing them are often confusing. McGraw Hill used to mean high quality, technical literature (my home library is full of their texts). However, this book was sorely lacking editorial oversight, allowing Predko to babble on, and on.For the software engineer who wants to understand the chip, he/she should read John B. Peatman's book on the same subject."
5,Excellent Book,Myke's book does a very good job of explaining how the pic works and how to base a design around the pic. The book is loaded with examples and good explanations. A necessity for anyone interested in learning to use these controllers.
3,"Decent, but suffers from poor organization and editting","This is the only PIC book that I have evaluated so far, but I am a little disappointed.This book gives a competent description of the PIC microcontroller, but in my opinion suffers from a lack of organization and editting.I found the text of the book to be repetitive and verbose. Diagrams and illustrations were repeated inappropriately. I expected terse, RTL-style descriptions of instructions, this book instead forced me to extract a functional description from lengthy verbiage and the direction of arrows on a figure. A table describing status register updates would have been handy.With these gripes said, the book is still a good introduction to PIC programming -- my expectations had been higher, however.Perhaps this book is better suited for mechanical hobbyists who want to quickly learn to implement a PIC design, rather than computer hobbyists who want all the rigorous detail."
1,Poor organization and writing,"After reading the mixed reviews, I bought this book anyway. Even the more negative reviews had not prepared me for the vague writing style and, much worse, the very real lack of structure. There is progression of ideas is weak and haphazard with insufficient explanation of basic concepts. It is possible to learn from this book, but only by reading the datasheets first, and then perhaps by reading the book cover to cover twice -- I had expected the book to serve as a self-contained introduction, allowing me to use the datasheet only as a reference, but I could not use it as such. Instead of this book, I recommend Peatman's book over this one (also sold by Amazon). It has everything this book lacks, and covers more ground, including features of the more advanced PIC controllers."
3,Technical Elements Competent; Writing Almost Unreadable,"The author is obviously very experienced in PIC system design. I hesitate to recommend this book for a beginner, however. The author sometimes seems to write for a beginner, then on the next page seems to require substantial prior programming experience.Unfortunately, the book is spoiled by the author's inability to write clear English. The publisher - Tab/McGraw-Hill - appears to have put this book into print without any attempt to untangle the author's many grammatical errors. The authors flippancy and carelessness with language comes across as a disrespect for the reader. Examples: ""I'm a bottoms-up kind of guy"" ; ""some people will get extremely obnoxious and will give you lectures on the baud rate vs data rate"" ; ""Actually, I lied"" ; ""I don't know if I'm just being anal retentive."""
1,"Technical errors, terrible organization, unclear explanation","This book has some good examples of both code and circuitry. Unfortunately, that is the only positive thing I can say about it. There are a number of technical errors and typographic errors. The book is poorly organized and glosses over many issues which demand more detail. From section to section the author assumes different levels of reader knowledge. Concepts are used before being defined, terminology is used incosistently, and many explanations make no sense. As an experienced engineer I can recognize the author's intended message, but the language fails to convey it. This book is the worst example of poor grammar I have ever seen in print."
1,PIC Microcontroller,This is the most poorly written book I've read in years. Spending a few minutes at the Microchip web site will provide better information (and the editing will be a few hundred times better.)
1,Waste of time and money,I do not care if the author has an old laser printer that only prints on one side of the paper or how he uses it to print two sided. I do care when I read through 300 pages of blah blah blah and get to the meat of the book and it does not work. Maybe he needs to update the book so it will be current with the present MPLAB. Maybe you need to save your money.IJF - GA
3,"OK but verbose, not for begining","It is a very broad overview of the subject. Kind of like seeing what the forest looks like, not the trees. I found it useful to get a good overview of the subject. I will now look for a book to help be actually build something. Unless you have experience with assembly code, this book is difficult. Not a good primer even for experienced engineers like me. To end on a positive note. It does give a great deal of information on many areas and is a decent reference."
4,Excellent Guide to lead you to ideas with chippies.,"The book is an excellent guide to help you to further visualize your project dreams. Concepts are written in plain english and it is very easy to make notes from the book. Because I am a software and electrical engineer (not to mention perfectionist) I crave a need for extreme details... so I've merged my notes from the book with important facts from Microchips' Datasheet for the respective PIC chip. Microchip makes an excellent range of PIC chips which are very easy to program, and Mykes' book will give you all the info you need to get started dwelling into the depths of black magic we call PICs."
5,An Excellent Reference for the Experienced User,"This reference can not cover everything you need to know even at 1200+ pages.Here is what I would do before I purchased this very complete reference on thePic microchip.Beginner's PIC book such as The PIC Microcontroller: Your Personal Introductory Course by Morton.Beginner's Electronics book such as MAKE: Electronics: Learning Through Discovery by Platt.Find a PIC chip that will suit your general needs and read the reference sheets from Microchip.This is the point when this reference can be used to ""fill in"" the blanks.If you are an intermediate user, this reference will be an excellent one stop resource.Mine is tabbed and filled with page refs inside the covers"
5,PIC microcontrollers programming at it's best,This book is just great. It covers topics not covered in other PIC books that really help a lot when programming the PICs.
2,Needs a re-write,"Reading this, I felt sorry for Mr. Predko. Doesn't McGraw-Hill have editors to point out that it is customary to create a logical, linear progression of concepts? Were there no proofreaders to tell the author that to immediately retract a statement is a waste of the reader's time and attention? The poor organization, grammar, and phrasing were not what I expect in a book of this price from a major publisher. The technical content is acceptable, given the implicit target audience of hobbyists. The processor architecture diagrams, though, are of a type meant for those who study or design processors. They are mostly useless for software/firmware developers who are more interested in the conceptual machine than how data flows through the ALU."
4,Classic Andy Rooney,"This is classic Andy Rooney. He has a lot to say about a lot of things and he has an interesting perspective. He is able to put down in print what a lot of us think about but never openly express. We need more people like Andy Rooney to ask questions about the way things have been, are now, and should be in the future."
2,Dissappointed,"A little dissappointed with Mr Cattaneo's latest mix. Listened to it over and over again and it never captured me, at least not like his last mix did. Although it was smooth and flawless in the mixing, he could have searched further for some more creative material. I give two stars for the smooth mixing, but as a DJ I take 3 stars away for non-creativity."
5,Dreamy Progressive with a hint of Funky,"Hernan does a great job at bringing the best elements from the lost art of progressive and blending it with contemporary, tribal, atmospheric finesse. Each CD brings its own mood to the table and executes it with precision. The first CD is a little funkier and chill with the second CD a relentless deep progressive experience. All the while it gives some consistency with hints and accents of dreamy atmospherics that truly distinguish Cattaneo as a Renaissance Master. The first CD favs are 2, 5, and the progressive tribal luciousness of track 6. Track 3 on disc 2 is an emotive wonder as well as midway through 5. An excellent purchase that I am 100% involved with now."
5,a good mix,"This cd was great, another masterpiece in addition to the already legendary South America and Master Series Vol. 1. Disc 1 had some cool and chilled out tracks but disc 2 was by far my favorite. Hernan's cd releases are, however, only a teaser of the miracles he performs live. Highly recommended album."
5,These are beautiful!,"Just as a word of warning the 5"" measurement refers to the space between where the handle attaches to the drawer. The handle actually measures 7"" in full. These are beautiful handles, they give our kitchen a modern flair and they make a drawer easy to open from any angle. They look so great we're putting them on the upper cabinets too."
1,For the Price -,"It is $6.97 at Lowes Hardware store, and betw. $5.91 and $6.24 with other Amazon vendors."
2,"removed the ground loop hiss, but messed up my radio!","I installed this thing between the AUX port of my CD changer and my iPod, to remove the noise caused by the satellite radio receiver being plugged in at the same time (a ground loop hiss). The noise disappeared alright, but it completely freaked out my CD changer - it started showing ""Error"" instead of the ""CD changer"" label and I was unable to switch between the 2 inputs (satellite receiver vs. iPod). Whatever this thing does to the signal, my CD changer hates it..."
4,Terminator 3: The Redemption,"This game has great action and very real characters.This was a GREAT purchase, my video playing sons love it!"
3,Decent but......,"Once again, this game is another example of video game makers being negligent of the needs of busy adults. Checkpoints, checkpoints, checkpoints!!! I am sure that one can go on the internet and get the needed cheat codes, but where is the fun in that? Overall, the hardcore gamer that spends hours in front of his/her machine will adore this game, albeit, it is a bit linear. If you want a really great game that has both good vehicle combat and third person action, along with checkpoints! I would suggest Metal Arms: Glitch in the System."
5,Copani Argentinean self critic,"Copani appeared in the Argentina's pop music scene in the late 80's he was living in Mexico doing kids songs for a while. He came back to Argentina with a bunch of song with deep social content mixed with humor; ""Cuantas minas que tengo"" is a faithful portrait of the typical Argentinean MACHO.""Rebelde sin Igual"" or"" Lo atamo con alambre"" are very deep social complains but in an upbeat way. He sound very 80's but if you understand Spanish and pay attention to the lyrics is a very enjoyable songwriter and great singer."
3,Not the best but not horrible.,"This book isn't a bad read, the story/plot idea is actually pretty interesting but the fact is, for a doctor Pilar is pretty dumb. She falls right in love and barely even reproaches herself for being what can only be considered ignorant. She really makes women look bad. The writing style of the book, however, is pretty good and I will definitely try another book by the author in the future."
3,Dickey makes mistakes,"For someone who knows so much about the 49ers,Glenn Dickey makes silly mistakes in this otherwise insightful book. It's pretty ridiculous he thought Roger Craig was the Super Bowl 19 MVP when it was in fact Joe Montana. What fan doesn't know this?! He also confuses ex Viking Anthony Carter with ex Viking Cris Carter while commenting on the '87 playoff game and among other things,he misnames ex center ""BRAD"" Oates rather than his real name of BART Oates. I suppose the last one could be a typo but overall,Dickey should have the facts straight and accurate before writing a book about the remarkable 49ers. I mean, seriously!Despite the mistakes,(and there are others) the book is very compelling and hard to put down."
2,Full of incorrect facts,"Being a 49er fan and season ticket holder, I am always interested in books focusing on football and specifically the 49ers. I must say I am greatly disappointed with this book. Glenn Dickey is a San Francisco local sports writer, but any 49er fan who only followed the team half of the time could have gotten more recollections of the 49ers correct than Mr. Dickey. Needless to say, this book is horribly researched and full of erroneous facts. You have a better chance of following the rise and fall of the 49ers football dynasty by going to your local library and finding news archives than by reading this book."
1,not for milk,I desired a product to make nut milk; this should not be used as it elevates bp. also it loses astringent value. The roasted product is o.k.
5,excellant,I really like these products. I had bought some similar to these chairs years ago and I wanted to replace them. I like the sturdiness of them and a straight back.
5,GREAT,"I bought this as a gift for my mother who entertains a lot. She has a big screen tv and wanted something like this to run in the background at parties. She loves it. You can have sound or just picture, mute works. This turns her big screen tv into a huge aquarium that doesn't need cleaning! The scenes are very life-like, I would highly recommend this product!"
2,living marine #2,Not at all impressed. The scenes look like they were shot from a camcorder a few inches from an aquarium. Better than a black screen on a large tv...but not worth paying for.
5,"Five stars but,","I just played through this,I've been playing Rainbow Six:Vegas before so I thought I'd give this a try.First the visuals and sound are superb,the outside combat is really cool,love the maps,but the controls are lacking.My biggest complaint is the taking cover feature.In Vegas just like Gears of war you push a button to manually take cover,in this one though its automatic.You walk up to a wall and it automaticlly takes cover,this sounds good but its really not.Throughout the game I did and did not take cover when I wanted it to,it can be awkward.Having said that there is just to much good not to give it 5 stars.Be warned though Rainbowsix Vegas is a better game,so get that one first then go here."
4,"Well executed, but short","If you like tactical shooters, the Tom Clancy games are the ones to get. This is a third person shooter and in much of the game you have control of a squad of 3. The game closely follows the first installment, with perhaps more polished graphics. The game can get complicated when you have to control your team as well as a UAV, Mule, A1 tank, etc. My biggest complaints are that the AI is still not that good (Rainbow 6 Vegas is much better) and the single player mission is short. If money is tight, get the first installment. If time is short, get Rainbow 6 Vegas. If neither is an issue, than get them all and enjoy!"
5,What a game!,"Great game, played GRAW and now this, very good game. New weapons, commands and multiple features."
4,This game is great!,"for someone who like slow-paced strategy games, this game could be the best choice in the market. the number of vehicles, weapons and different strategies make this game a must buy game. However, you might not be satisfied with the graphics like I did. For example, if you by any chance play medal of honor: airborne (even though is not exactly the same kind of a game) you'll see the amazing difference between the graphics of these two games and ask yourself the question: ""why GRAW2 doesn't look as cook as this game?"". However, after all this is one of the best war-simulation games on the market."
2,glad I rented it...,"Heard this was a short game, so I rented it from Blockbuster for 7 bucks, finished it in about 4 nights (Probably 9 hours). Games are becoming increasingly short and/or unchallenging nowadays... That said, the game is a lot of fun, but not for sale at 60 bucks!"
4,Advanced Ghost Fighter,"The game is somewhat like socom 2, but not as good, im now getting used to the controls, but it seems to be fairly good."
3,Good but...,"I love the ghost reacon series more than any other game, but even though this game is worth buying because you will have fun. I am just disappointed because the only improvement over advanced warfighter was a little better graphs and little better AI.NEGATIVES:*The game will not allow you to react fast to situatios, the gun moves to slow.*No full co-op campaign which makes this game be another of the bunch and lose one star.*The same bugs from last version (lose two star).POSITIVES:*Continuation from last game.*Fun to play.I am still waiting to see fi there will be a game better than Rainbow Six Vegas which in my opinion has been the best game ever created so far."
5,One More Exellent Game,"I believe that the people who say that this game has not improved over GRAW are being to hard. The graphics are better, the gameplay is better, and the stratagy is better. GRAW 2 is a blast to play alll around."
5,Is this the Vegas killer?,"I like this game but boy oh boy if you have no clue what you are doing, you will be killed on Xbox Live every 10 seconds."
2,Good Product,Game sucked but the transaction was good. If you are looking for a good shooter Rainbow 6 Las Vegas 2 is the best.
2,Way too hard to play for me......,"I purchased this game for my new xbox... and as a 45 year old man, this game is way too hard to play. I am looking to relax and need something simple. Too many commands. I am sure the game is great but it was just too complicated for me to enjoy."
4,DAVID'S OPINION,"OK, Dear all, the disc was good, I played all all campaign. But, I do like the first one more."
1,Company Sent WRONG Game,"The game is alright, and came in a timely manner. However, we ordered GRAW2 and instead, surprise, GRAW1 came in the mail. Dissapointing."
2,Ghost Recon 2 Advanced Warfighter,The saves are spaced too far apart in this game. I got bored doing a half hour of the game over because I was killed with one shot.
4,very real and great,my play ghost recon selease is first ghost recon for ps2it game is so real I'm fine so much betterthis soft is it grafics more evolution
3,Half the stars for half the game.,"This is going to be quick, just like the game. Great graphics, smooth gameplay, decent AI (working with your squad is not too cumbersome or awkward) and very fun to play.However, I finished the game in less than a weekend. Like 6-7 hours. And not on easy. Felt rather disappointed when the end credits started to roll. 12 short missions does not make a full game."
2,Repeat,"I don't know if I'm the only one who noticed this, but this game is more or less the same as AW1. The story is really the same, and granted I might be missing the ""subleties"", honestly a better title would've been AW1:Again, or AW1:Huge Expansion Pack of the Same Action. Comparing this game to the bigger shooting titles like Call of Duty or Halo, this game doesn't really compare. The aforementioned big titles are there for a reason, and while this game has it's fun points, if you're looking for a good FPS game, just do yourself a favor and get Call Of Duty, you'll be glad you did."
3,Ghost Recon Review,"I have been playing Cal of Duty 2, 3 & 4 so I thought Ghost Recon would be a good side fight but so far I haven't been able to reverse the up and down gun controls like in Call of Duty and I haven't gotten out of training yet. It ain't as usuer friendly as the Call of Duty games..."
4,More Of The Same?,"this game is almost Exactly like G.R.A.W.1., there isnt much to really SAY thats New to the franchise. the handling is tuned up a bit i Guess. i dont play through the Missions much, i play Online..and THATS as Fun as the first G.R.A.W. as well. i dont necessarily see WHY they felt a need to release this game if they werent going to improve MUCH on the previous release...basically, if you liked GRAW1, youll probably like this one about as much.Great game to shoot out online with..but get it when its under $20.iLL ."
1,extremely disappointing...,"I liked the first Ghost Recon. It was challenging, had some length to it, and was a pretty good game.Ghost Recon 2 is supposed to be all-new and improved with new features. It's not. It's not even worthy of having 2 in the title, because it's not much more than a sad overpriced expansion pack.They don't even try with the story. The game is RIDICULOUSLY short. I completed this in a few short hours. Definitely not worth 60 bucks!!!!Since Rainbox Six: Vegas came out, the whole FPS scene has changed. Save yourself the couple of hours it takes to complete this forgettable game, and save the $60 you'd spend on it. Instead buy RS Vegas and see what the greatest FPS ever made looks like (and it's at least a very challenging, fun, and lengthy game)."
1,Game freeze problem and bad customer support!,Good: This title has great and improved graphics. Little tweaks that give this game almost prefect gameplay.Bad: Short single player campagin. Buggy online voice communication and people drops offline are very common. A little pricer than the last title.Ugly: Freezing bug (undetermined reasons from software or hardware) makes this game totally unplayable on some old XBox360. Some have even reported that the game bricking their consoles (the 3 red light of doom). Hundreds of complains on the Ubi and MSLive forums but yet any reponse from the companies in the first week. This kind of customer support really breaks many gamers' heart.
4,Ghost Recon,"This was for a bunch of boys to play and they had fun with it. I thought it was a bit mature for them and don't really care for the subject matter,"
3,My refined review.,"I reviewed like 2 months ago titled ""A few complaints but still a killer title"". I call this review ""refined"" because I just recently played on XBOX LIVE. I gave this game an 3.5 instead of a 4. Durring my first online match, I realized that you cant take cover online!! It was so frustrating to get shoot while franticly pressing the Y button. I dont undertand why this was left out since it was a fundamental part of the campaign. Also since vegas allows you to cover online i just doesnt seem right. From a 4 down to a 3.5 but still a great game."
4,Single Player fun but too short.,This game improves upon the 1st however it is much too short and I would say much too easy. Even on the hardest difficulty I had no problem completing this in a couple days. I still don't understand why the multiplayer can't be the same as the single player or why we can't play the single player missions co-op. This game is more like 1.5. Not part 2. I certainly wouldn't pay $60 for it.
4,its great,i had to get use to the controls but its very fun to play online chating with people. i have had nothing but fun with this game. offline play is very good too.
2,Not that great,This one shouldve stayed with just one. GR was fun. This one was just ok. I felt that the added features were just inconviniences that slowed the game down. Not the best tactical shooter.
5,Graw 2,"Overall a good game, havent played the first one but been told has many improvments. The game is very well detailed, looks almost realistic even when played on a regular TV, on a HDTV its unbelivable.The campaign (single player) is somewhat unexpectedly short but played on hard it is certainly a challenge, the story line is well done and is fun to play.The multiplayer is where this game is worth it. With several different game types (solo, Team, Campaign, Coop) and then several alterations making each game customizeable and diffrent almost each time. Definatly a good buy."
4,great!!!,The weapons are great in this game. I liked it better than the first version because local multiplayer is more fun.I like that most of the weapons you use are not invented yet such as the rx4storm. or the zuesT2 you can also choose lots of different people with different skills for your squad. Like the first version you can take cover thank goodness!!!!! I would have died a lot if not for that. The first actual mission is fun if not short they take only twenty minutes. I detest the tutorial I mean why do you think it comes with an instruct ion manual!!!! Otherwise it is barrels of fun.
2,smallish,im sure it said how small it was somewhere in the descript; so my bad. this thing aint big enuf for either head!
1,A disingenuous appeal to antinuclear sentiments,"The title contains the flashy words ""nuclear policy"" and ""secrets"", but fails to address the subject of Israeli nuclear policy, or even the broader issue of weapons of mass destruction at the hands of Israel or any of its neighbors. Though the title indicates that the reader will learn what was not known before on Israel's nuclear weapons, the fundamental questions on Israel's nuclear armament are not treated at all. Instead, the sensational title is misused to promote a particular view of the Arab Israeli conflict. A book such as this one could harm serious antinuclear activism, as it may make it appear politically motivated."
2,Watch Out - Bound With Paper!,"I got this dictionary a year ago for Christmas and always felt that it served me fairly well. Recently it fell off my bed and the front cover completely ripped off! It was then I discovered that my seventy dollar dictionary was bound with paper!! I am severely disappointed with Random House whom I thought was an honorable company. I looked at my Oxford thesaurus and sure enough, it was bound with cloth the proper way. I will be discarding this dictionary for one that is less expensive but no doubt of better quality."
3,Also deceived,"I agree with ""Katsnjabber"" and ""N. Thomas 'LibraryFiend'"". I am so disappointed. I already had the 2nd edition, c2001. Then I saw notices of a 2nd ""revised"" edition dated 2005. I thought that if changes had been made, it should have been called the 3rd editon. But the 2005 date and the word ""revised"" confused me. So, I went ahead and ordered it and discovered to my disgust that it was the same as the one I already had! The copyright date on the verso of the title page was still 2001!Another sucker"
5,Great gift,My husband was excited about his new dictionary. This old one was from the 70's and a bit out of date. He'll do much better at his crossword puzzles now.
4,Webster's Unabridged Dictionary,"The book contains great information about words and their usage, but it is a great pity that they bound it so that it was hard to open sufficiently to read near the binding. For lovers of words this dictionary should behave more like a spiral bound book. To me this is false penny pinching that leads to a lifetime of discomfort for end-users. A typical management decision according to my experience--based upon their needs and not taking into consideration why customers want them to remain in business, whose needs they are serving, and not taking the using needs of customers into account. However thank you Amazon for your service; the product was received speedily and in great condition."
4,"Unreliable binding, hurts when you drop it on your foot","The Random House Unabridged dictionary captures about 315,000 of the 20 million words in the English language. After dropping it on my big toe yesterday, I used several more words that were not referenced in it, and also learned the definition of pain. My toe turned blue due to the blunt impact, with the weight of this dictionary tantamount to dropping a deadweight hammer. Furthermore, the binding on my 3-day old dictionary delaminated, and it is now in the garbage. This is the first book I have ever owned that has caused human injury and has serious quality problems in its assembly.I recommend this dictionary only with the use of steel-toed boots and in a safe, well-lit place of use. Aside from safety issues, the content of this dictionary is quite useful."
4,I will buy it when ...,I will buy it again when (a) they come out with a serious update and (b) they offer a DVD version only -- I no longer need a ton of regurgitated dead trees.Meanwhile it is my computer dictionary of choice despite a clunky out-of-date interface.
3,THE WAY OF DICTIONARIES,WE USE OUR BOOK WHEN WE PLAY UPWORDS WHICH WE PLAY ONCE A WEEK. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT MY OLD BOOK HAD MORE TO OFFER. HOWEVER I AM WILLING TO ADMIT THAT IS PROBABLY THAT WE ARE SO USED TO THE OLD ONE. MY HUSBAND SEES NO DIFFERENCE.
4,"Murder, war, God and more!",This is an excellent book which provides a great introduction to a tumultuous period in history.
5,LOVING OUR NEW VIDEO,"WE DECIDED TO ORDER SOME ""LAZY TOWN"" VIDEO TAPES, AS YOU CAN NOT FIND THEM IN ANY OF OUR LOCAL STORES. OUR SON, WHO IS 2, CANNOT GET ENOUGH LAZY TOWN.THE VIDEO WE ORDERED WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED AND IN GREAT WORKING ORDER, ALTHOUGH I DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW LONG IT WILL REMAIN THAT WAY, WITH THE NUMBER OF AMOUNT OF TIMES WE WATCH IT.THANKS FOR THE GREAT VIDEO!"
5,Amazon and West Bend...a perfect blend,The process of ordering was simple and painless. Delivery was prompt and in perfect order.The mixer is exactly what I needed. It is light and powerful enough to do all my household mixing tasks. The bowls and beaters are first class. Noise is kept down to a comfortable level. I can actually hear the TV while working with my West Bend. I'm looking forward to years of good service.
2,"weak, weak, weak",I bought this for my parents for Christmas to mix the ricotta cream we use to fill cannoli for the holidays and it didn't quite do the trick. It was not powerful enough to mix through the thick cream. It may be ok for some light mixing.
5,Don't Miss It!,Kindred is a the kind of novel you won't be able to put down. It is insighteful and so real the suspense will keep you wired until the end. You will remember it long afterwards. Kindred is a wonderful book I will pass on to all of my friends.
5,I really liked this book.,"I really liked the book. It had a lot of suspense to it. I liked Kevin. He was my favorite character. He was always patient and wanted to be there for her. I liked the symbolism behind her travels back and forth. Butler did a great job in writing this book. She did a good job in doing the time travels the way she did. Every time she went back to her present time, the past was not all right and vice versa."
1,Does the poor writing here bother anyone else?,"I wanted to love this book--I love time travel stories and I am writing a novel that deals with post-slavery life--I had every reason to LOVE Butler's story. I cannot even begin to express my personal disappointment at how poorly this amazing story concept was executed. I am a very demanding reader--it is SO distressing to find a great idea squandered with lack-luster prose littered with detail minutiae that added nothing to the story. A very telling detail: I read with a pencil and highlighter in hand--for margin annotation, and to highlight particular lines that blow me away. I didn't use either one while reading this book. Butler's writing never reached my heart, her characters were arranged in scenes like so many one-dimensional paper-dolls.I know these are fighting words for fans of this book--but I have to say that wanting to love this story made my disappointment in it all the more bitter."
5,Wow!,"I'm not normally a fan of science fiction, but this book literally left me breathless. It's fascinating and paints a painfully realistic picture of slave/slaveholder life in the early 1800s. Hats off to Ms. Butler for an outstanding novel."
4,I read it in a day,"It was an interesting concept and I really enjoyed the story. It's not for everyone but if you are interested in America's slavery history, it's a good read."
3,Kindred (BlueStreak),Good book and it kept my interest throughout. It was difficult putting it down due to it being such good intense reading.
4,Recommended,"Fast transaction. Good price, and in very good condition. Book was very entertaining and descriptive. The facts were accurate with a bit of a sci fy twist."
4,Not my kind of book and I still liked it,"I liked this book, even though I don't usually like historical fiction. This book is much like a historical fantasy because the main character keeps traveling from the present to the past (unwillingly). Readers will learn about some events that happened in the past in an entertaining way."
3,A Step Too Removed,"For me, anyhow, this book left too much unsaid. We're given the physical horrors of the place, as well as the emotional tragedies, with appropriate regularity and thoroughness. And of course the story still gives a unique perspective on slavery that could only be effectively accomplished within the premise Butler devises. But for all of that, I wanted more from the story and characters. The main character's narration never seems to do her experience justice. It's so precise as to border on clinical. At no point did I get lost in the narrator's voice the way that I have with Ellison or Atwood, to name the two other writers Butler's work evokes for me.The story is harrowing and moving and painful and insightful, but all of that is dulled by language and characterizations that are too stiff. Perhaps this is a hallmark of Butler's early work. This is the first novel of hers I've read, and I look forward to reading her more mature novels."
5,Awesome story,I thought this book should have been a movie...on second thought hollywood might destroy the story. This is one of my favorite books. The character development was great.The descriptions were convincing. The author humanized even the villains. The consequence for every action was well thought out. This is a very clever book.
3,"despite this book, i love her!","Kindred is an okay book. It got boring for me in the middle. As some people have pointed out, it is written from an African American point of view, which is unlike Bulter. She usually seems to write from the perspective of a being, flawed and connected to all others somehow. Race is usually a minor detail. I think that she attempted to connect African American's with the past in this book.She wanted to make slavery more real to us, so that we wouldn't forget the history of this country and our history in it. But she is a science fiction writer and this was not science fiction, so it wasn't one of her more focused and consice books. It is my least favorite of all her writings, but I urge everyone to read all of her sci-fi books because she is truly an amazing author."
1,This book reads like a report,"I honestly hate to say this, but I have to wonder if this author stands out because she was a black woman writing science fiction, obviously a rare thing. But am I missing something? This book intrigued me when I read its premise - it is wonderful! Time travel combined with slavery! I dove into the book, just knowing the author was going to amaze me...and instead, I found a story riddled with poorly drawn characters, totally unrealistic dialogue, and even less believable plot points. What should have been horrific events are relayed without emotion, so that the real impact of slavery and its attendant cruelty is lost. I may be in the minority, but I honestly feel Ms. Butler dropped the ball on this one. I can't recommend it."
2,"A Decent Book, But It Could Have Been Better","When I first started the book, I really disliked it. I thought that Octavia Butler's writing was rather childlike and poor, but as the novel progressed, this improved. That was not my main concern. The ending was rather rushed and pointless, and the loss of her arm at the end [which they tell you about from the beginning, so I'm not spoiling anything] really wasn't necessary. I simply believe that the ending could have come in a more appropriate way. As for the novel in general, it was a pretty entertaining story but I wouldn't really classify this book as science fiction; it was more like historical fiction. All in all, a decent read, but it could have been much better if certain elements were avoided."
5,An excellent work of African American Fiction,"I had this book cross my path when I was in high school and had to read it as part of a project. This story is so engrossing that I quickly read the entire thing within a single night. Even though we only had to read the first three chapters. Kindred is in a league of it's own, and for a good while I couldn't find it. But the Death of author Octavia E. Butler brought this novel across my path once more. This book is excellent, and well worth owning. Octavia Butler is a talented and shamefully underated author. My only wish is that her death will bring kindred and many more of her novels to the forefront of african american literature."
5,A MUST READ!,"I have just finished this book and all I can say is, it is wonderful! I highly recommend this book. In the past month I have read ""The Time Travelers Wife"", ""The Hobbit"", ""The March"", and now ""Kindred"", of all of these I have to say this was my favorite! I literally couldn't put this book down."
2,Not good,"This was ok for a whiney, preachy, treatise on how a time travelling negro from the 70's ends up stabbing to death her slave owning ancestor...We get it, slavery sucked. If it didnt, wouldnt we still be doing it?In fairness it is probly good that these types of books are out there, it was 20% intersting, 20% well written, 40% trite tripe, 15% reverse racism and 5% unexpected.It is worth reading, but dont believe the hype that was out there when the author passed. This book wont change your life, or mind, or anything. It probly wont move you - unless you tear up at hallmark commercials, but if entered into with lower expectations, it should still be enjoyed."
5,New Lover of Ms. Butler,"Thanks to the uninhibited mind and writing of Ms. Butler I am a new believer in the world of Science-Fiction. For an African-American woman to be such a phenomenal sci-fi writer is unheard of and remarkable.Kindred is a must-read! I was moved by the story of Dana and Rufus. Without giving the story away, I must say that the inner-struggle that Dana had to go through to act as a guardian angel of sorts to Rufus was amazing and well-written. I felt every emotion that Dana felt and probably then some...I could not put this book down and grew angry with the clock when it told me it was time to stop reading. Please read this book if you are a sci-fi lover or not, you will appreciate the writing and talent Ms. Butler displays with this novel."
5,One of the best books I have ever read.,"This book is amazing. Butler has this brilliant way of making her audience truly believe she was around when the slave trade existed. Her writing is so vivid that even the impossible details seem realistic with her incredible writing skill. This book really put the slave trade into perspective and helped me to understand a little more fully the life of a black woman back when slavery was legal. Butler did her research and truly spoke with the voice of a proud black woman who is not ashamed of her past, but instead rejoices it in this novel meant to end ignorance and invoke appreciation for the struggles of the people who made the world what it is today."
4,Spellbinding and bewitching,"Kindred is my first book by Octavia E. Butler and definetely not my last. The story about a 26 year old black woman , Dana who is suddenly brought back to the 19th century to continually her white ancestor, Rufus from death therby ensuring her own exietence. The story is further complicated by the fact that her ancestor is a slave owner and is very racist. I found Kindred to be a spellbinding book. Mrs. butler does a fine job at not only making the story interesting by adding other complications but she also makes the story flow which makes it hard to put down once you 've started it. It also asks some very profound questions, the most significant being what would you do to survive as a slave? Kindred was a definete suprise to me. I expected to read a story that was entertaining but i didn't expect to read one as thought provoking and profound as it was."
5,Beyond Great!,"I really felt for and loved the characters, even the minor ones. The ideas in the story are hard to forget. Butler did an amazing job at taking such a sensitive and diffcult topic and put it ino an apporachable and fun genre. This book will bring up many many good discussions.I dont usually re-read books but this one I will"
4,Kindred is moving.,"Kindred, by Octavia Butler, is moving and eye opening. Butler weaves a present day story with one of the past. She also uses an inter-racial couple as her guides through these two very different worlds which provides an oppertunity for contrast between the treatment of ""white"" and ""black"". It is also an incredible comment upon ""the body"" and how we visualized black bodies in society. I would reccomend that this book is read with the idea of ""the body"" in mind"
5,Amazing...,"When I found this book at our local bookstore I wasn't sure about it as this genre has never interested me much. But I opened to the beginning and read the first page, and then the first chapter, and then the second... I couldn't stop. Butler's writing style is simply effortless and evokes characters and places so real that when you finish you feel that you have returned from a far away place. Her prose is as haunting as it is captivating, and the questions it presents will remain with the reader for a long while. You won't be able to put this book down."
4,Kindred - A unique science fiction novel,"I don't normally enjoy science fiction novels, but this story was a major exception due to the fact that it was so interesting and I was really intrigued by the writing of Octavia Butler, who is a very realistic as well as unique writer. The reason Kindred is so unique is because of Butler's distinctive style and outlook. I really liked the style and subject choice of this novel and the fact that Butler decided to add to the story the idea of moral choice, which is one of the hardest choices any persons can face."
2,Didn't do it for me,This book gave a very realistic view of whar slavery was like. From a historic perpective it did a excellent job in its illustrations; however the story line was poor. I never felt a strong connection to any of the characters to really sympathize with any of their fates. A better read for me is Jubilee by Margaret Walker.
2,There are much better books out there covering the same topic,"I read this book at my literature groups recommendation. I didn't care for it. I had a bit of trouble wanting to finish it. I have read several other books that cover the same topic (outrage at slavery, the cruelty of practice and the stark contrast to current times). I didn't hate this book but I would not recommend it to anyone as anything more than a fluff book, which anything discussing the awful practice of slavery should never be, in my humble opinion. The leader of our book group, an assistant professor of library science, loved it. She raved and raved and instigated our group reading the book. One of my fellow book group members also did not see what the fuss was about but perhaps she too reviewed the book here."
4,Great thought provoking read!,"My book club read this last year. I had never heard of Octavia Butler and the thought of ""sci-fi"" turned me off. This story may be about time travel, but that is just the launching point."
3,"Well writen, but the time travel aspect is full of holes","I think all these years after this book was written it might be a bit unfair to judge this book by today's standards of science fiction. Nonetheless, the author's unwillingness to address the aspect of time travel in any real way and to not even have her characters wonder about the paradoxes involved in going to rescue your great great grandfather and interfer with his life several times were to me a very noticeable weakness in the plot. Changing the course of one man's life, especially one of your direct ancestors, could greatly effect your own life on earth, to the point of eliminating it. Dana never even seems to think about that aspect. See ""Time and Again"" for the single best time travel story of all time. Read this book to understand better the horrors of slavery."
5,Great Read!,Loved this book! I wish I hadn't waited so long to read it and I am ready to re-read it! It will be my go to gift book for those who read and do not already have it. Love it!
4,Great book,"Great story line. Loved the ""Sci-Fi"" aspect of the story. Wish it would've eneded differently though. Too many unanswered questions."
2,overall disapointment,"i bought this cd with great anticipation, but it was a major letdown. coleman is a monster, but in his effort to sound like miles'trumpet, he is out of tune and way outside the changes. stern offers gorgeous solos but the phaser/flanger that he employs on his telecaster sounds awful. his tone is terrible. jimmy cobb dissapears in the background and the bassist tries to hold this session together with some succcess. overall, this gig stunk, and the cd will gather some dust."
2,overall dissapointment,"i bought this cd with alot of anticipation, but it is a serious letdown. the quartet sounds out of whack and the sax is hopelessly out of tune. coleman is a monster but in his effort to sound like a miles trumpet is hard to digest. the great jimmy cobb is lost in the background, and mike stern's tone(he plays his telecaster with a lousy phaser effect) absolutly stunk. i was shocked. stern has some good moments but the horrible flanger/phaser tone ruins his efforts. the bassist tries to hold this gig together with some success. this one will gather some dust."
5,Great adivce for any parent,"As a first time parent, I don't always know the correct response to my 15 month old and her actions. This book has been a life saver! It is easy to read and understand. I feel as if Dr. O'Brien is talking directly to me. My favorite section is the note area at the end of each chapter. It has been very interesting to look at notes from previous months and see how much my daughter has changed. I recommend this book for any parent who wants to try and understand their toddler better! Thank you, Dr. O'Brien"
4,You guys are crazy!!,"Regardless of the negativity that SNL has lost its punch, sorry, this compilation is dead on! I watched SNL when Gilda and the bunch were around and I have stayed with them, accepting the newness, the change of the times and the political agenda it encompassed. SNL kept going, bringing it all in and still taking those punches. I really bought this collection because I am a huge fan of Jake Gyllenhaal. I think he is on the road to many incredible performances, ones that will surpass his already brilliant career. His choice of movies and characters showcase a talent not seen by many of the new people and his intervention on SNL was a delight showcasing a great sense of humor. And that is what it is all about, having a sense of humor. Get off the train wreck of negativity that SNL is dead. Get on board and laugh. We really need it, peeps. C'mon, watch and laugh. Become human again!"
1,Slim Pickings,"Either 06/07 was a horrible season, resulting in very few clips to release, or SNL is very stingy about these DVDs. This is the first one I bought and I was shocked by how little made it on this release. It started off with Jake Gyllenhaal's opening monologue, then skipped over the rest of his show and flitted over other shows with 1-2 clips max from each. There were no other monologues. It's very much like the ""Best of"" shows you would see on the E channel - brief and leaving you feeling short-changed. I deeply regret this purchase.If you're looking for a particular show, go to amazon video download feature (which lets you purchase a show, though it looks like even that's edited down) or go to the SNL website which will give you A LOT more clips to see than this DVD."
4,Funny!!,"It was pretty funny, but I wish they would have had some more skits from Justin Timberlake. Then it would have been a five star item!"
2,Not as Advertised,"This book has nothing to do with ""Christ in Art"". The text is a summary of the life of Christ, accompanied by images of Christ in art; however, the images are not discussed at all in the text and they don't support the stories being told. If you're looking for descriptions of ""Christ in Art,"" I suggest you look elsewhere.I ordered this edition (April 2010) but Amazon sent me the second edition (December 2010, with the Crucifixion cover).I was not impressed at all and I sent the book back for a full refund."
1,Got rid of it!,"I write this review as a winter sports lover. I've been sledding and snowboarding for decades.This sled is dangerous! It gains speed so easily and is extremely difficult to control once it does.My child broke his leg and required stitches after this sled sped out of control.I have never been on a sled like this. I was so happy to throw this piece of s*** away.Want to have fun playing in the snow? Get something better, and save yourself a potential trip to the ER."
1,low quality,"Bought this ""three person"" tube and now regret it. Much smaller than size described. It is thin and 3 young kids can fit on it but not adults. Air knob opened several times while tubing. Buy Uncle Bob's tubes. Better size and quality."
2,not a real value addition,Folks!! The very purpose of having a laptop gets defeated with this unnecessary add on. If you think you need this then better buy a desktop system and same some real cash.I do not recommend this.
3,Hamilton beach 68010 snowman ice shaver,the thing I like with this product is it is easy to use altho it chooses the kind of iceto crush the smaller the ice the better and is slow had I known it was going to be what it was I would not have bought it altho it still served the purpose for why I bought it
4,Tricky but works well,"I bought this shaver in preparation for my son's tonsillectomy and it has been a LIFE saver because he has to take medicine that upsets his stomach so he needs something in it first. I've been mixing jello mix with water or soda and then freezing it in the molds provided and then shaving the molds. So far, so good. My daughter (who did not have surgery) also likes the treats. The only problem I have is that sometimes it does not want to shave so I have to cut the molds into chunks and fiddle with it. However, once it gets going, it's great. One other review said you don't have to press down hard, but I find you do have to be very firm."
2,Snow Job,"Beware of using anything that is not rock solid as it gets up under the push plate instead of getting shaved down into the bowl. This is strictly for shaving hard ice - not flavored ices no matter how hard frozen. What does come out is nice and fluffy, but you lose lots if it softens at all before it shaves."
2,Toy you get what you pay for !!!,"Not worth what they charge for unit, just (TOY),save you're box;for return,and spend a lot more and be happy and save time making drink's."
4,Great Simple Affordable Ice Shaver,"Pros:-Ease of use. Just place the ice and press the top. Tip: Know your strength. Do not press too hard.-It produce very fine ice shavings.-Cleaning is easy. It is just water, so you actually just need to rinse it. I do not know if the blade rust, but make sure it is dry before you put it back to the shelf.Cons:-You can not use the ice cubes from your refrigerator which is the most convenient source. You have to use the supplied ice container, fill it with water and freeze it first. Make sure you do not lose them for they are the perfect ice shape, it even has ridges at the bottom to make the ice clamped to the shaver ice holder. It would be better if they give you 3 or 4 containers instead of two. For a family of five, you need more ice.I tried only a couple other shavers, but I do not know any other that is better for this price."
3,Great while it lasted,"My boyfriend bought me this as a surprise because I love super soft-shaven, ""new Orleans style"" ""sno balls"". And for a while, it worked great. I got some good syrups and followed all the directions, and the snow cones came out great. But after about two weeks, the thing stopped shaving the ice. The motor would run but the ice would rarely ever come out of the bottom. I tried different kinds of ice, different methods of putting pressure on the machine, and everything i could think of, but it would take 5x the time to make even half a snow cone, and even when I managed one it would be big, crunchy pieces of ice, not the smooth shaved ice it made originally.All in all a big disappointment."
4,Hamilton Beach 68010,"The electric Ice Shaver makes fine shaved ice, but I had a difficult time to get the blade to grab the ice and get it moving. Once it started it was okay, but it did take some effort."
4,Great!,"This product is great for a shaved ice fix. We even shave ice for our dog...he loves it. Starting the process to shave the ice sometimes can take juggling the machine a bit but product is less than $20 so it's understandable. Note the two walls on the sides are narrow so you have to find and use a small, taller bowl. Other than that, it's great!"
5,"Great Product, Great Price","I got this 2 months ago and have really used it a lot. It shaves the ice perfectly and easily. It's never gotten jammed. Plus, it's not just for ice. I make a great Pina Colada drink by freezing crushed pineapple, pina colada drink mix, and rum extract. Then you shave it and add it to vanilla ice cream and pineapple juice. That was a Pampered Chef recipe from a long time ago, but it also has ideas in the instruction booklet."
1,Frustrating!,"If I could give it a ""0"" stars I would. This piece of junk is destined for our garbage can. The machine is very slow, works sporatically and if you have children anxiously waiting for their snow-cone it is excruciating. First of all, you have press down on the top to engage the motor to shave the ice. A safety switch is supposed to turn the motor on only when the machine is in the right position. Unfortunately, this means you turn and press and move the ice and try and try to find the sweet spot where the motor will start going. At first we thought the problem was too much ice or that we overfilled the ice container but we have tried everything and the machine is just very touchy. DO NOT be fooled by the positive reviews like we were -- you will only regret it!"
5,snow cone maker,"I bought one of these about a month ago, and i use it about every other day (i'm not kidding) it makes awesome snow, and is really easy to use. I bought the rival brand strawberry daquri flavored syrup at a wal mart, and that, some plain shaved ice, and some strawberry yogurt makes an awesome real strawberry daquri"
4,Frozen Treat,"Having great fun with this. As other reviewers have written, it is not for major snowball making. For my 2 kids the 2 chunks are enuff. As previously recommended, try freezing juices because sweeteners do melt the shaved ice fast. I have some sliced strawberries in juice now. I'll update the review and letcha know how it worked!"
4,It works good,I like this machine it's good for hot days. Al thought it takes it's time i think it does a decent job. I don't really use ice cubes because sometimes it jams. I prefer to use the plastic container put water in it freeze it and then just drop it in. it won't jam and it's faster.
1,Not real good in the safety first department,"Yes, I will agree the blade is out of reach when you are using it. However, it is too open and accessible when assembling, cleaning, or storing.Little hands can get cut on this very easy even with mom or grandma helping.I found campared to the Rival snow cone maker this is not a very good machine."
1,defective and inadequate amazon/antononline responses,"the product was defective when i received it, so i give it one star. anyone could ocassionally get a defective product - then you find out about the company's customer service: how does it handle returns and refunds. my process to obtain a complete refund including initial and return shipping is an example of exactly the reason a person would have second thoughts about buying anything on-line. my e-mail correspondence with antononline and amazon was extensive, and too much to recap here. i finally had to talk to an amazon person live to get full satisfaction. i received the defective product on june 28 and finally achieved satisfaction on july 20 after talking live to an amazon employee - far too much time. while i have generally been pleased with service from amazon, i probably will not purchase anything else from a non-amazon seller - i have had an unpleasant experience."
1,Defective out of the box,"Mine was defective and/or broken, even though we had just taken it out of the box. Had to return it."
3,Not bad,"Not quite as soft and ""flaky"" as real shaved ice, alas, but the appliance is simple to operate and clean. Loses a star for the ice quality and another star for the price, which I feel is a little high."
4,Good product,"This product performed as hoped. I would recommend using the ice molds that come with it -- you get a finer shaved ice than with regular ice cubes. Also, you don't have to buy over-priced syrups for it. Just get some frozen juice concentrate in a flavor you like -- it works fine. In Hawaii, they put the shaved ice & syrup over vanilla ice cream -- try it, it is really yummy that way."
5,Surprisingly good,"I was looking for an ice shaver to make sno-balls/hawaiian shave ice. I've tried several ""snow cone"" machines that produced crunchy chunks, the opposite of what I wanted. This produces a very fine snow when using ice blocks made from the included molds. The only way you're getting better than this is by purchasing a commercial block shaver at around $2000.Pros: very fine ice, like snow. This will make new orleans style ""sno-balls"" and hawaiian style shave ice. 2 ice molds. Easy to clean.Cons: Base is a bit narrow and short. I couldn't fit a bowl, or full size cup underneath to catch the ice coming out."
3,Mary L,"The shaved ice is extremely fluffy and fine just as advertised...but positioning the top so the pressure switch is engaged is a challenge. Also, I have to press hard on the top to completely shave the ice disc. Makes a great snow cone if you do not mind a little work."
3,Nothing special,"It is acceptable - nothing special. Takes about a minute for one serving, but when you add the syrup the volume of the ice decreases by half (unlike shave ice you buy from a vendor). I think I would have preferred a hand crank shave ice machine so I can control the speed. Acceptable for the money - good for kids, not for hosting a party."
5,A Taste of Hawaii...,"I miss the shave ice we used to get when we lived in Hawaii. This machine shaves the ice great. No lumps of ice chuncks at all. I bought the Hawaiianshavedice company's syrup and it's just like home for sure. The other stuff in the stores just doesn't compare. You can use the molds included to make ice blocks, or use regular household cubes from the freezer. You can freeze coffe, juice, etc, then shave them for a special treat. I use this with my daycare kids, on family trips, or just because I miss ""home"". The only downfall is one ice block makes one large snowcone, so we froze a bunch of them and kept them in the freezer for when we get a crowd. Overall, I love this machine. A good buy!"
4,Unreasonable shipping charge for extra ice molds!,"Though the machine works remarkably well as an ice shaver, there is a dark side to Hamilton Beach (HB). If you want an extra pair of ice molds, they're just $2.50. However, the non-negotiable shipping charge, get this, is $7.99. Any part or supply you need to buy from HB, requires a shipping charge that is based on the dollar amount of the item...not on weight, physical size or real shipping cost by a carrier. In this case, the charge for anything purchased between $0 and $9.99 is a flat $7.99. In my mind this predatory merchandising practice devalues Hamilton Beach products to the point that I am encouraged to shop for an alternative brand/manufacturer. Shipping and handling is viewed by HB as a lucrative hidden bonus that they benefit from...and you, the consumer, must suffer. Does anyone know where a spare set of ice cups can be purchased...other than through Hamilton Beach?"
4,Good shaved ice!,I have had my Snowman Ice Shaver for a month and really like it! Yummy shaved ice!! I use it 3-4 times a week. I have only used the ice made in the included plastic containers. (I haven't tried cubed ice.) This is a very decent ice shaver for the price.
4,"Shaved ice crusher, perfect! from Amazon, great buy, good product","This ice crusher is of good quality. It crushes the iceinto ""shaved ice"" which is great for snow cones, or goesgreat with a beverage, or just to enjoy shaved ice all by itself.I recommend this ice crusher. Amazon has great deals on any product,and this was a great price for a good product."
4,good soft shaven ice,"i really like this ice shaver. the ice is snow like and you get a good amount out of the molds provided. i normally purchase another brand, but this one is definitely a bang for your buck!"
1,A dirty little secret about this book,"This book would be of value to those who study disinformation. The authors assert that about 4,000 American soldiers deserted in Vietnam during the war. They presume that all these deserters were drug dealers and junkies who did not want to face the music and melted into the civilian population. This part of the book is not supported by checkable statistical sources. Anybody who ever lived in that country knows that 4,000 Americans drug users could not melt into the civilian population nor would they even want to. I saw the body parts and identifying information of one of these alleged deserters burned with gasoline in a trash barrel. He was set up to be a drug dealer. The battalion was right there mingling in the party and said nothing about the distribution of hashish and heroin that was arranged by ARVN officers. The whole battalion reeked of it. They did not desert. The author's conclusions are based on questionable sources."
3,"As stated above, a primer on the Vietnam War","I read the book 12 years ago and thought it was great. I read it again this month and have to say it's just okay. In the intervening years I have done a lot more reading on the subject, mostly trying to find some information about the time I spent in Vietnam with the US Army. The book is definitely worth reading, but it's written at about 8th grade level, not on a lofty scholarly plane. My two specific criticisms are the lack of a bibliography and repeated references to the ""13 month tour"" for the Army. As any Marine will loudly tell you, they did 13 months. The rest of us did 12 months, unless they got early outs like me. Buy Dunnigan's and Nofi's book as an introduction to the Vietnam War and then start digging into the Time Life Vietnam Experience series for the details.The Vietnam Experience - 25 Volume Set Complete"
4,Very interesting Vietnam war`s history book,"From the beginning I read with pleasure, because I found two books in one, at least. History of a particular War, and all those information that help to understand after all these years. Very good!"
3,"Leather? More like ""Pleather"" but still not bad","The case fits well but it certainly doesn't feel like leather. It appears to be vinyl. In spite of this, it is durable and works well. It is well worth the $5.99 price with Free Shipping. However, anything over this price, I'd recommend purchasing one that is better quality."
2,"wrong product, bum steer",I ordered this case for my desired phone through amazon only to find that I could not get the phone so I ended up with a different phone that did not fit the case and it isn't worth it to pay to send it back. There should be a warning that you can't buy a Cingular phone service through Amazon in California.Burned
4,To Stand Out In A Crowd. . .,"This item caught my eye during an exhaustive search for just the right pendant for my new chain. Finding a pendant that is both affordable and unique was a bit of a challenge, but this pendant was just what I was looking for. It's not solid, but concaved in the back, but otherwise it's everything i had hoped for."
5,Fathers are people too,I had a chance to peek at an advanced copy of the book and I was floored by the creative advise and down to earth approach. I should have read this book 5 years ago when my son's were still young. Luckily I'll have plenty of time to practice on my daughter.
5,"If you own more than 24 colored markers, this book is for you.","Back in the day, ad agencies, design firms and sign shops hired young artists to prepare ""comps"" or comprehensive layouts with Pilot Razor point pens and Magic Markers. Some illustrators even specialized in free-lancing these kinds of drawings, the best of which were genuine works of art. Since the advent and now ubiquity of Photoshop, this skill has largely fallen out of use. And if one does want to mimic the fresh, spontaneous, translucent, water-color-like properties of markers, Photoshop has several brushes, settings, and filters which come pretty close. When I did storyboards for J. Walter Thompson, I owned a dog-eared copy of Rendering With Markers. After several moves, and a conversion to digital art, my copy disappeared. When my youngest asked for a 36-pen set of Pental colored markers, I knew she needed an operators manual. Some day she may even thank me."
3,Not the same as the picture on the box!,"I am a preteen and I still love to play with dolls. The picture of the item on the box was very big and apealing. I have a 19"" doll and it did not fit at all in the swing wich really dissapointed me because I spent my own money on it. It took a while to assemble, my mom did it. I recomend that you do not put it on hard wood floor because it fell over. I also recomend that you only put small dolls in there."
4,Graco motorized swing...child's,"Santa bought this for our daughter. She is quite pleased with it..although, we are being very cautious with it. She is a twin and her brother would like nothing more than to give her a ride in it..or go for one himself. Anyway, this is a very sweet toy. Just a couple of batteries and you are good to go...AND it shuts off on it's own...otherwise, we parents, would need to take stock in Energizer.My kids like it because it is the same as the one I had for them as infants..all in all, I recommend buying it. Every little girl dreams of these! Good price for product, too."
2,Not worth it,"This was the first game that I bought for my PSP Slim and it was not worth 40 dollars. 40 dollars is basically the full price of a just released PSP game and I was utterly disappointed with it. It's a good premise but the crappy controls and shallow story line make the whole game frustrating. Frustrating that you spent so much of your own hard earned money to buy. The graphics are good but there is little substance. The game was so easy that I beat it in all of 2 days. There is also little reason to replay this game which further degrades its worth. My advice to you, just buy another game or perhaps two since this game is so ridiculously expensive."
2,Mediocre Game play...Decent story line...WAY TOO SHORT!!!,I would not recommend this game to a friend because the game is way too short and the AI is terrible. The graphics are pretty good for the PSP but the rest of the game is sub par.
5,"Short Campaign, Awsome Multiplayer","I am a fan of Tom Clancy games. GRAW 2 ,I think,is the best so far. It has a short campaign but it is very fun. Multiplayer is the best. There's four different modes to play: Campaign, Firefight, Defend, and ReconCampaignIs the same accept with a friend.FirefightIs where you and a friend go around killing tangos.DefendIs where you and a friend protect two trucks.ReconIs when you and a friend scout out some areas.Graphics: 8.5/10Sound:9/10Gameplay:9/10controlls:9/10Story:7.5/10Overall a pretty awsome game."
3,SOCOM is a much better game.,"Both SOCOM games,Metal Gear series and Killzone are all much better games. I waited 2 months for this game and picked it up at Best Buy the day it came out. 7 hours later I was finished with it. Graphics are nice, but missions last about ten minutes and are without any real payoff. NONE of the buildings can be entered. Not much in the way of co-op play. AI consists of the enemy running around like a chicken without a head. Weapons are nice. No replay value. 3 stars is very generous. Tactical Strike comes out November 6th."
3,It's okay.,I played this game and loved it but it got boring for a while that's why it gets three stars.
4,"Not exciting or anything, but at least it's my favorite toothpaste!","It's got your average minty flavor, but it's ""Plus Whitening"". Who DOESN'T want their teeth whiter these days?I remember back in 7th grade (and yes, I know this is too much information but) I used to seldom brush my teeth. I could go days without brushing, but then I'd give in and brush my butters! ^_^bI'm pretty much the same way these days, but if I have somewhere important to go, then I brush. And when I finally find a partner, I will brush EVERY DAY! Sounds pathetic? Yah. It is. But I'm only human, and sometimes I see this act as a pointless one. But I should brush more...4.5 stars."
3,Light toothpaste,This is good but it doesn't foam like Crest and kind of disappears in my mouth. I like the taste and not super gritty like some.
5,Basis of the Church's pastoral problems since Vatican II,"This book has been reviewed by the emminent Fr Peter Joseph STD in AD2000 Vol 16 No 5 (June 2003), p. 17: ""Dr Rowland argues that the anti-beauty orientation of mass culture acts as a barrier to the reception of the theological virtue of hope, and ultimately fosters despair and atheism.""I found the book's insights on when to adopt/reject the concepts of rival intellectul traditions especially helpful. There are pastoral as well as important philisophical lessons in here.Read Fr Joseph's entire review ..."

A story of a man with a dream, Jack, who builds Golddigger, a loveable and benevolent robot. Jack and his creation fight the evil Eli, a crooked antique dealer with a scheme so big, the world would never forget it. With an all-star cast including Johnathan Rhys-Davis, how could one go wrong?

5,Excellent PRODUCT,"One of the best products for dry hair and dry scalp. No greasy residue and leaves a beautiful, healthy shine. Love it."
3,It'll do.,"Sometimes you just need a down-and-dirty dictionary that plops a word in English down beside a word in modern Hebrew - or vice versa - and says, 'There, that's it. You gotta' problem with that?'That's what Yisrael Lazar's English-Hebrew-English dictionary does. That's what it promised it would do and it followed through.You got a problem with that?If you want rugged simplicity on the go and can make the stuff that's gotta' be finessed wait until you're back at the home or office, buy Lazar's dictionary and don't look back."
1,Color leaked all over the boat,"I bought a large spool of red PP to back my offshore trolling reels. The first time they got wet, the red die went all over the boat. Not a small bit, allot of it. It stained the canvas.I contact PP and they told me to buy some shout.... Thanks allot!!Stay away!!!!!!"
1,not that great,"I bought this CD for one song, and it is the only one I like unfortunately. I do like his version of I Can't Make You Love Me."
1,A Crock,This book misrepresents eating disorders and makes eating disorder sufferers almost seem psychotic. The author is very inexperienced with eating disorders and only has her word to back up her statements. She puts down eating disorder facts that have proven to be true. The one good thing about the book is how she encourages treating victims of eating disorders with love and compassion. I think her kindness is what drew her clients. She states that her way is the only way to help anorexics which ignores the fact that people are individuals. And she ignores the fact that other therapists besides her have had a high success rate. Some of her theories almost seem demonic or mystical. Almost like those with eating disorders are saints or psychics of some sort.
5,"Shelley Christy (real name), Pittsburgh, PA","I read about ""Nordie's at Noon"" from my weekly PEOPLE magazine subscription. I actually bought the book on vacation and could not put it down--it is a quick read, but so very powerful and inspiring. I admire these four ladies' courage and their stance not to be victims. They are true survivors and are an inspiration to anyone faced with any type of illness. I passed the book along to a friend who has breast cancer as well. When you read the book, you definitely feel like you know the four authors. I recommend this book to ALL woman!"
4,FANTASTIC!,"I have been a long-time supporter of breast cancer research and really enjoyed the tales of these women who were all diagnosed much younger than anyone thought possible. This book made me laugh and cry. While I was sad when it was over, I walked away inspired and uplifted. Would make a perfect gift for any woman in your life!"
4,Must Read!,"Most of us have been touched by cancer in some way. This book will walk you through that process with hope and humor, along with sadness. These friends will make you hold on to your friends tighter!"
5,Wonderful story that got to me.,"This book was a touching tale of four women who became friends through breast cancer - even though they were all ""too young"" to get it. It is an honest, open look at every stage of breast cancer - the diagnosis, treatment, death and the life you have to deal with along the way. I am 32 years old, and this book FINALLY got me performing self breast exams. I think that speaks for itself."
5,Grab the tissues!,"I bought this book because the four authors are from Kansas City and I am really glad I did! I enjoyed reading their courageous stories and it was a real eye-opener about living with cancer and the toll the treatments took on their bodies. Their stories were a real-life account of what living with cancer is like. The book was a little repetitive at times, but overall very well written. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent book- Nordie's at Noon,"I am an oncology nurse, and I found this book to be both medically correct and very interesting. I cried, laughed, and got easily involved in this book. The women gave very honest and frank views of going through chemo, as well as projecting their personalities and strong will to live. Highly recommended!!"
2,Very Poor Video Quality - Not a real Collector's Edition...,"The first time I bought this item, I returned it due to scratches on the DVD. This DVD is of very poor quality - doesn't even come close to the set that was done for the 2006 NBA Championship that the Miami Heat won. No inserts, nothing that adds to the experience of re-living the championship. I wish the NBA would have been the one making this set and not Bombo Entertaintment - or that it would be in Blue Ray... Some camera shots are very hard on the eyes from the distortions. Poor quality. I personally recommend the other DVD of the Championship and not this Final set."
4,Awesome for Any Heat fan!,"The DVD set is great with full coverage and options to listen to the National Broadcast or Local radio coverage, however I was disappointed when there was no coverage of the Lockeroom celebration or the championship parade. However still a great set for any heat fan!! GO HEAT 2012 NBA CHAMPS"
3,Great Start but confusing toward the end,"I used this book to re-enforce my understanding of PeopleSoft and how it is structured but I was only able to gain a very basic understanding of how to use the PeopleSoft development tool. Also, I had to pay very close attention to the text written in the book and the illustrations provided. It is very easy to get lost and confused."
1,Too basic,"This book assumes that you know nothing about PeopleSoft and is not a good reference for any programmer. I have been developing in PeopleSoft for 2 1/2 years now, and I have never found a bit of information from this book useful. Save your money, and buy the SQR in PeopleSoft and other applications."
4,Two boys' review: Durable and fun -- a great Batman villian!,"The Man-Bat is a redesigned villian from ""The Batman"" animated TV show. The wings on this action figure are really fun to play with because they are flexible and durable. This is a fully articulated action figure produced by Mattel and a great addition to your Batman action figure collection."
3,An alright book,"If you like to read you will like this book. But I on the other hand don't like to read so I gave this book 3stars. I liked things in this book, I also disliked many things in the book. One thing I liked was the differnt detail Jerry went into. Like when he was describing the colors of the bird. ""Pink legs and feet green and puple neck white wing tips. I disliked how he ended the book. We'll never know what happend to nipper Palmer and his friends. He ended off haveing a little girl say daddy I want one that was stupid. So all around it was an average book."
2,"Not Great, a Copy of Lottery, but with a Message","This book is both good and bad in different ways. The way that it is good is that it carries a major message. I personally believe that the same message was better carried by Shirley Jackson in her short story ""The Lottery"", but the more it is stressed the better. This book yet again puts forward the fact that a person is capable of much destruction of life, but I do not feel for pigeons in the same sence that Shirley Jackson made me feel for people. This book made me very bored with its stereotypical characters after page 80, and none of the characters grew through the corse of the book. In conclusion, I believe that this book was very well written, but lacked the substance to keep me interested through 200 pages."
4,wringer,"the plot was pretty good. About a boy,Palmer who dosen't want to be a wringer when he is older.I think that most kids would like to read it."
3,Wringer,"Palmer's mind is changing just as his age, and it is amazing how one child, especially being so young, can actually handle all this emotion. But even though this book was quite good, the part about killing pigeons for money for the town park was outrageous. There is no reason why our human race should want to kill thousands of pigeons just for one day of fun. How could all those people calling themselves humans, sit and watch birds suffer, and then just sit there and laugh like they were at a comedy show. I think a town could find lots of different ways to make money instead of killing. Even though the important lesson of this book is to follow your heart, it should also be that animal cruely is wrong and wrecks people's lives."
3,sometimes exciting,The story is about a boy that becomes one of the bean's boys and a wringer. A wringer is a person that wrings wounded pigeon in the pigeon shoot.
1,No Just Stop !!!! Please,This book is so genius the writer probably wrote it while he was either in jail or about to die of age it is so random and boring like the bean trees.If you read this book and fully understand it may god have mercy on your soul
1,disappointed,"I am truly disappointed in the subject of this book. Killing of a pigeon as a rite of passage. Yes, the boy defies tradition but for a ten year to get a detail description of how to kill a bird is totally inappropriate for 10 year olds. I teach 5th grade and I do not want my students to read this book. I can guarantee that we will have a rash of killing in the neighborhood as a result. The story about how Phillip decides to not become a wringer is OK but did you have to put in a step by step description of what you need to do to kill a bird. I love Spinelli books but this one is a disappointment."
5,Wringer,Wringer is a good book.It is about a boy named Palmer Larue and he is dreading his tenth birthday because he doesn't want to be a wringer.Every year there is a pigeon shoot and every pigeon that is shot the wringer has to go on the field and wring the pigeons'necks.Well just when Palmer thinks nothing can happen that would be worst a pigeon shows up at his window.Palmer becomes attached to the pigeon so attached that he gives the pigeon a name.In the end Palmer has to stand up for what he knows is right so he does.I reccomend this book to anyone who can read and most importantly anyone who loves to read suspenceful books.I give this book 5 stars.***** Shaniqua
3,an okay book,"Wringer, by Jerry Spinelli, is about a boy and his pigeon. Palmer, the main character, is keeping the pigeon a secret because his town kills pigeons. There are these boys that are his friends, or are they?Palmer is my age. I liked it when he played with his army men. His dad taught him how to set them up. I felt the baseball sequence was confusing. After reading the story, I found out they didn&#65533;t really need it.Wringer&#65533;s message is to stand up for what you believe in. Also, to stand up for what&#65533;s right, even though some people don&#65533;t think so."
3,Wringer,"Palmer counts the days until his tenth birthday with much suspense. For in his town, when you turn ten, you become a ""wringer"". Every summer Palmer's town has a festival that includes a shooting match. The wringers job is to wring the necks of the pigeons that are wounded in the shooting match. For most 10 year old boys becoming a wringer is a honor, but to Palmer it's a nightmare. Throughout the story palmer has to deal with keeping bigger secrets then he can handle, including hiding a pet pigeon in his room, and learning how to stand up for himself against his peers and what he believes in."
4,"""tradition""","Wringer is a good book that taught a valuable lesson; to stick with what you believe in. For example, in the end where Palmer was 10 years old and was supposed to be a wringer. He was supposed to kill the Pigeons like the other kids, but he didn't he stuck with what he believed in. That takes a lot of guts, to go against tradition"
5,Wringer,"I spent hours late at night reading this great novel by Jerry Spinelli. I have read many books in my 12 years. This book is about Palmer LaRue. Palmer does not want to be a wringer, he does not want to kill pigeons like the whole town does. When Palmer gets a visitor at his window Palmer starts to live two different lifes.This book is very inspiring it has inspired me to be a writer.I give this book five stars."
4,"The Wringer review-By,Remix Jr.",The book that I read was the ''Wringer''. The book wasone of the best books that I read except in some parts I didn't understand. The book is about a boy named Palmer LaRuethat lives in Waymer. Palmer is about to turn ten there is going to be the biggest event of a ten year olds life. The event is an annual Family Fest and it's a tradition to become a wringer when you turn ten. But on palmer's tenth birthday he has something to tell but is afraid to say it which is that he doesn't want to be a wringer.
3,Get ready to read!,"Teeth lovers beware! One character, Beans has teeth you will not want to here about. The main character Palmer does not want to turn ten and neither would you. You will encounter the nicknames Fish Face, Beans ,Mutto, Henry, and Snots. A small all American towns are peaceful all year around except for one day Pigeon Day! The main part of the book is Palmers joining the group, and Palmers wild, and soaring pet. I love presents! Do you love presents? Well Palmers are a cigarette bud, a crusty sock, and an apple core. This is a really great and sad book. I gave it 4 stars. This is an exciting yet sad book."
5,Gr8 book,It has been along time since I read wringer from what I cn remember it is and excellen book I read wringer in third grade and loved it! I just couldn't put the book down!! So from what I have to say I suggest you read wringer!!
4,This is an interesting but good book,"To me, This is a really good book with good description. The only problem i have with this book is that the kids are too young. I think that 9-year-old's would not be thinking like how the author made the kids act, think and behave. It would have made more sense if they were a couple years older. But overall, I loved this book and i think every kid from age 12-25 should read this."
4,Wanna Good Read?,"Have you ever had the feeling that you were the main character in a book? Well this book gives you that feeling. ""Wringer"" is an exciting and suspenseful book. You can hardly ever predict what is going to happen. I liked this book a lot because I felt like I was there. My favorite part of the book is when Dorthey finally stands up to the Beans Boys. It is funny how she stands up to them."
4,Wringer,"I would recommend this book. I would recommend this book becauseI thought it was very interesting. I'm a person so doesn't really like to read, but this book made me enjoy reading. This book is for an animal lover, and for people who like goriness."
1,What the HEEAZY??!?!?!,"I thought this was supposed to be a CHILDRENS book. Not a wannabe hyper-intellectual attempt to shove morals into my face...with a PIDGEON?! I mean....Mr. Spinelli, what in the world were you THINKING?!?!"
5,Wringer is the best,"I read this book in fourth grade and it is the best! It beats allthe other Jerry Spinelli books(Crash,Maniac Magee,Dump days,etc)My favorite part is when Palmer meets Nipper(a pigeon).I hope youget this book and enjoy it."
2,weird book,"This book was pretty boring. It revolved around a conflict that didn't seem all that important. The main character lives in a town where they shoot pigeons to raise money for the park, and he has a pet pigeon that he keeps secret. It's not really clear why he cares so much about this bird, it's just a dumb animal. He isn't a vegetarian or anything, or at least it doesn't say so in the book. The only thing I liked in this book were some of the characters, even if they were the antagonists - Henry, Beans, and Farquar. I wouldn't like to be friends with the last two, but they were interesting enough to make me finish the book. A lot of the people who gave this a negative review think it's violent or depressing, but I thought it was just a boring topic to write about."
1,This book is dumb,Wringer was a dumb book. It was not one bit appealing to us. Killing pigeons is not something We'd like to read about. How could one ten year old do something so dramatic to change a whole town's perspective about pigeon day? We would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,"""Wringer"" was a slow-read","I found the book ""Wringer"" to be a slow read. It was hard to keep turning the pages, and this book was a Newbery Honor book. The whole world of the main character is exaggerated, it seems, and he only worries about what his so-called friends will think of him. I have read several Newbery winners and honor winners and I really can't figure out why this was one of them. It moved along very slowly and was hard to stick with."
2,Wringer,"BORING!!! Wringer was the worst book I have every read. Palmer, the main character, lived in a town where they had these things called wringers. W ringers were when people went around twist necks of pigeons. All of Palmer's friends did it,but Palmer was to much of girl to do it. So instead of killing a pigeon Palmer go out and gets a pigeon for a pet. But he can't let his friends find out or they will twist the pigeon's neck and Palmer's. The only reason I didn't give this book one star was because one of Palmer's best friends, Beans, made the book a little funny and Beans was the only reason I didn't throw the book away. I would only recommend this book to girls because they like this heartwarming stuff. The book Wringer isn't for any man's eyes to see."
2,wringer,The book was o.k. I liked it when it would get exciting and maybe funny at times.One reason why I didn't like it was because at the beggining of every chapter it never left off from where the end did. And at the very end of the chapter it never told what happened to any one except that palmer's piegon wasn't hurt.
2,A reader from South Dakota.,"This book was pretty good because it had some action. It waskind of bad because some parts were boring. Like when Palmer andDorthy kissed each other. My favorite part was when Palmer was getting taken to Farquar. Beans, Mutto, and Henry took Palmer to Farpuar 2 times Palmer didn't like it either time. My least favorite part was when Palmer and Dorothy were in Palmer's room and Dorothy kissed him."
4,Palmer turns ten and will participate in family festival..,Palmer's tenth birthday didn't turn out the way he thought it would. His family thought it would be a great way to celebrate.Palmer wanted to play all the games with his family. Later four thousand pigeons were set free. One pigeon followed Palmer and wasn't scarred of him. When he got home the pigeon was there. Later his dad went hunting for a while with the neighbors. Palmer saw his dad wringing the necks of the pigeons. Looking at the dead pigeons made him sad.
3,It's an All- Right Book!,"When our class started to read this book I thought it was good if you didn't like action. Definitely do not read this book if you are a bird lover! It's a book about a kid who lives in a town where every year there is a family festival. At this festival there is a pigeon shoot where 5,000 birds are shot. The boy in the story doesn't want to be a wringer. A wringer is a 10 year old kid who wrings the necks of pigeons who are hurt but not dead."
4,the wringer,"The Wringer was a very humorus book but there were also some very emotional parts. 9 year old Palmer Larue was an average kid that had 3 good friends, Beans, Mutto, and Henry. In the town that these boys lived in, at the age of 10 you became a wringer and would run out on the field and wring the necks of the pigions. Although they were all good friends Palmer did not like the idea at all of being a wringer but his friends did. Palmers friend's always put him under pressure and sneak out at night to Palmers house and take Palmer to mysterious places. Then one night Palmer was awoken by a loud scratching noise. To find out what it was and what it was doing outside Palmers window you have to read the book. This ""thing"" outside of Palmers window ended up teaching Palmer very valuable lessons and helped Palmer end his fears."
5,Wringer,"I think that Wringer, by Jerry Spinelli, is a captivating, moving and powerful book. I stayed up until midnight to finish this book. I found Spinelli's characters, situations, and dialog believable, though this book may be for more mature audiences than suggested. I think the Newbery Medal on Wringer is well earned."
4,amazing,"""Snots"" is accepted into the crowd as he turns nine. Just a week after his birthday is Pigeon Day, his most feared day of the year. That is when he is scared to even watch, not to mention to wring the pigeons. Snots fears his ninth year of his life, knowing that he will soon be forced to wring the pigeons. Snots must hide the secret of his ""pet"" pigeon.This book brings life to pigeons and is an awesome book to young readers. I like this book because of the tension that builds every page, just like all other Jerry Spinelli books.Z.L."
2,This book was about a kid who doesn't want to wring birds.,This book was about a kid who does not want to wring pigeon's and his friend have been stocking him.
3,okay...,"Wringer was extremley dissapointing. Throughout the whole book, I loved it. But when the ending the came, the author seemed as though he didn't wrap up the conclusion very well. The book focuses on Palmer, a nine year old boy who fears becoming a wringer, a conspiracy in his town where boys at age ten wring pigeons necks. The whole idea of this book is strange, but keeps you hooked. Palmer then wakes to hear the tapping of a freindly pigeon on his bedroom window. Palmer befreinds the pigeon, feeds him, cares for him and gives him the love he needs. He has to keep his pigeon a secret, for if anyone found out it was his pet, the pigeon would be killed and Palmer would have to face the ultimate humiliation. The end of this book is sad and confusing. When this sad event happens, Palmer felt free, and as though he was flying! I recommened you read Wringer, only if you can be prepared for a lousy ending."
3,Review of Wringer,"I gave the book ""Wringer"" a 3 star rating or in other words I consider this book average. ""Wringer"" was very basic at times. It didn't always go into the storyline. The ending wasn't that great either. It left me wondering and left some things unanswered. ""Wringer"" had a lot of intense and emotional situations. The topics in this book were another thing. The topics were sometimes harsh, upsetting, and gross. These didn't always bother me but they may disturb others. I would recommend this book for readers the ages 9-11. The main characters are in this age group and the book is easily read. Also some topics could be upsetting to younger readers. ""Wringer"" would probably interest someone who likes realistic fiction stories with morals in question. Two reasons I would recommend someone to read this book: 1)""Wringer"" was never really boring or slow. It always kept me guessing. 2)It had realistic characters that you can relate to or familiarize with."
3,Why'd you leave us hanging?,"This book is about a kid named Plamer. Who does not want to become a wringer. We don't like the ending because it left us hanging. We wanted to know what happened to the other characters, in the story. What happened to Henry? Did he quit the group? Did the little boy at the end of the story get a pigeon. These are all of the things that we are wondering!"
1,A not so great book.,I had to read this book for school. I really hated it. It is so gross. It gave me nightmares.
2,POOH BEARS REVIEW,"Hello my name is Jameisha and i think this book is not that good to me because when you read it sometimes you dont understand it like in the beginning of it.This is my review for this book. I think the person who wrote this book could of did an way better job then what he did.If you get this book to my knowledge it's going to wasit your time,but it's up to you to make a good choice.Okay i'm gone admit it , it's an okay book but the author could of did a better and more desent job.This book is about a child named Palmur and why he didn't want to become a wringer."
3,"Powerful, but drawn out too long","This book was really good in that this isn't another Cinderella tale changed just slightly. There is nothing like it with a story line that even comes close to this, so I think the originality of this book is what made me pick it up and read it. One thing I didn't like was how nothing really happened it in the book. It wasn't a page turner, and those are the kind of books I really enjoy. But it is a really beautiful book, because it shows how the only reason everyone hated pigeons was because everyone ELSE hated pigeons. But, in truth, many people were hiding just like Palmer, and Palmer was the only person to stand up to the town... and to himself."
1,"Caution, do not read this book!","I don't think this is a very good book. There are some exiting parts, but they were short. The book started out being boring and never got better. The book was weird. It had a lot of stuff that didn't make sense. There is not really any action in it. The characters didn't act like real people would. The people did stuff that real people probably wouldn't do. I didn't like the way the author ended the story. It was a sudden ending."
5,A great way to teach children about openess and friendship,"This book was amazing. I read it in a group for one of my senior-level college classes in Elementary Education. A few people in my group thought that the story was primarily about killing pigeons. That right there told me that they had not read the book. The ones who did all loved it and realized how wonderful this book conveys the importance of friendship- true friendship, that is- and being open with your parents. Since reading this book, I have purchased six other Jerry Spinelli books. I plan to teach somewhere between 4th and 7th grades, and will read to my class(es) regularly. I have read almost all of them now- they are all terrific- Jerry Spinelli is a wonderful author!"
5,Wringer a great book to read,"Wringer is about a young man who turns 10 years old and gets a special treatment.But when you turn 10 years old in there part of town you automatically become a wringer (a person who wrings pigeons necks)But palmer does not want to become a wringer. So the next day Palmer hears this storm and at the end of this storm a pigeon comes into his window and stays there. Palmer now takes the bird and loves it and cares for it.But palmers friends are wringers so he has to keep it a secret.Palmer and his friends dis like his neighbor and bombs her house with egg and toilet tissue and they also put a dead carcuss on her door step, but later in the book they become friends"
2,okay read,This book was okay to read and entertaining if you have an imagination and vision what is happening. highly recommend.
5,Wringer,I purchased this book for a school assignment aNd found it to be a unique twist on a familiar theme.
4,Wringer is about a boy names Palmer.,"There is a kid named Plamer who doesn't want to be a wringer. But, his friends do. He keeps a pigeon in his house and tries to not let his friends know he has one. I think this book is O.K. I like the part where Palmer and his friends start to argue. The down side is there is not much wringing, when it is called Wringer. I would probably recommend this book. If you like shocking stories and surprising stories, I recommend this book.Sincerely,PS2"
4,The great book,"I would give the book wringer four stars. I would give it four stars because some parts were interesting and some parts were kind of boring. It is about a boy when he turns 10 years old he has to become a wringer. A wringer goes around shooting pigeons on the annual pigeon day. They have to shot the pigeon and then if they don't kill it they have to wring their neck. But before he turns 10 years old a lot of things happen to him and he gets mixed up with the wrong type of boys. While messing with these boys, he does a lot of bad things. It is a great book you should read it."
5,Palmer is so cool!,"This book is mostly about a boy named Palmer who lives in a town that hates and kills pigeons. One day a pigeon comes and taps on his window. So Palmer says to the pigeon, ""Why did you come here? Go - shoo! Leave!"" But the pigeon doesn't leave, so Palmer takes care of the pigeon like a pet.He doesn't tell anybody except his old time friend, Dorothy. One day Palmeer's ""gang of tough friends found out that he had a pigeon and start harassing him.Yhis book is for anyone from ages 8 through 80. Thank you Jerry Spinelli for writing this marvelous book!"
3,Dreading birthday,"This book was about a a nine year boy who was dreading his tenth birthday because he does not want to be a wringer.If you didnt know what a wringer is it is a person who shoots pigeons and wrings their neck.He has 3 friends mutto,beans,and henry.He ends up having a pet pigeon named nipper and he keeps it a secret from everybody until the end.He also has another friend dorthy but he says he's to old to play with girls so they start to bully her in lots of ways."
5,Mr. Gilmour!! Justin,"In the book Wringer, a boy named Palmer, who is 9 years old, starts out not wanting to be a ""wringer"" which he knows next year at the family fest, he will have to be. The problem with not being a wringer is all the boys that live in his neighborhood will make fun of him if he isn't one. He tries so hard to be accepted, he makes some bad decisions along the way including hanging out with some kids he knows he shouldn't, and ditching his own best friend!One night, he wakes up and a very special visitor comes which eventually makes his quest for acceptance even harder. The visitor changes his life forever, and Palmer ends up saving his life. To find out who this mysterious visitor is and if Palmer gets accepted or if he gets pushed around by everyone he knows even more, read Wringer by Jerry Spinelli."
5,The first Spanish Novel I have read,"Like several other reviewers mentioned, this is a fantastic book to read when you first learn Spanish. I read this book as my first full novel in Spanish. The great story kept me plowing through the piles of new vocabularies and unfamiliar sentence structures. I recall my reading speed had improved at least 10x from the beginning of this book to the end of this book. Of course, I was till reading very slowly by the end of this book, however, to be able to read a full novel in Spanish boosted my confidence in learning this new language tremendously. By the way, I also used the English version as a crutch, and it was very helpful for learning the Spanish grammars."
2,3 GOOD SONGS!,"Only 3-4 good songs in this album, specially ""A Strange Education"". It's only the reason if i've bought it.I think there's many work and progress to do for these guys."
5,I needed it and they delivered,"I needed to control the lights in my bedroom, and I received the product before the due date.It's nice to know that their is still service around.dd"
1,WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"This is the worst instructional video I have ever seen in my life. It is amateur footage of him teaching a bunch of kids and he looks drunk while doing it. Dont waste your money or your time with this, it is money and time you will never get back in your life!There should be laws against this poor quality amateur BS,"
1,find a better video,"This is a horrible video. As far from teaching you how to ""Master"" the escrima as you can get. The production quality of the dvd is worse than my kids made for their Middle School Projects.What you see on this dvd is an amateur home move of someone teaching a basic escrima class to a group of relative beginners. You will pick up a few pointers if you have never held a stick, but it is too painful to watch, and if you have ever used the sticks and are looking to improve, you will be so sorry you wasted your money that you will hit yourself with your own sticks! Look for something by Rene Latosa instead."
3,"Good, but doesn't last","This is a nice light, however after a period of time, the night light bulb burns out & there's no way to replace it. I had this happen to 2 of them. Someone who can fix anything attempted to open one & it broke. So for a year or so it will work. Two emergency lights I recommend: Sentina Smart Light Nightlight (worth the price) & Palight."
2,Doesn't grind -- it powders!,"If you like the bitter off-taste that comes from overextraction, then this is the coffee grinder for you. Even the coarsest setting grinds the coffee much, much too fine for good clean flavor. To get a decent grind requires pulling the plug before the grinder times out -- which obviously defeats the purpose of the custom settings. I give two stars instead of one because if you ignore the custom settings and time the grind process yourself it works OK."
2,Overvalued,"This book may be good for beginners in a business course. In reality, if you're in a management position of any significance and don't already know everything this book talks about, you must be hurting."
1,May be the worst appliance I have ever bought,"I purchased this product with the idea it would help me out at Thanksgiving from having to cut celery & onions for stuffing. It didn't. There's a chute where your food is suppose to feed through a grater & into a bowl. Doesn't work. It gets stuck in the grater. I had to continously clean out the ""chute"" to keep it going. I actually ended up chopping everything myself. Would not recommend."
2,Only good for a small number of uses,"I received this as a gift, and am VERY glad I didn't spend money on it. While it does a decent job of chopping/cutting...it's not great. Plus, it doesn't contain the food very well, and you end up having more outside-the-unit cleanup than you should.Also, the size is REALLY small. If you are doing a salad, chopping for a large recipe....forget it. It's only good for maybe a cup of chopped whatever-you-need at a time. It ends up taking more time than it saves, what with cleanup, lack of size, etc.I would recommend it for very small chopping jobs, or as a gift for someone you aren't fond of or don't see very often."
2,Baby had tremendous gas!!,I read the reviews and was excited to try this product... from the start I have always produced a lot of milk but since going back to work my production started declining. This product unfortunately did not work at all for me! By the second day of taking the pills this gave my baby serious gas-- he was in so much pain I felt terrible. Also it didnt help with production at all. So it may have worked for others but not for me.
5,Great for breastfeeding,"I started taking these for breastfeeding. The first week, I took as directed I think it says 4 or 6 per day. The next week I lowered it to 1-2, and now I take two. I can notice if I miss a day or so because my milk supply seems decreased. I believe it has really helped me."
1,I was optimistic...,"I was excited, according to the 5 star reviews..but this did not work for me, only because i couldn't even give it a chance to work (to help me produce more breast milk). Although I've read that this product helps to reduce headaches (after researching the product, because of my headaches)...it gave me REALLY BAD ONES...I did start my dose with 2 pills, when i took the next dose. I got a really horrible headache. Not thinking this was the culprit, I took another dose and another headache. Stopped taking them the next day, then decided later in the day to take them again and I got another horrible headache. Even tried to take just one, and although headache wasn't as bad, still got one. I'm just glad that i didn't spend a lot of money on this. I've also found..the only real natural way to increase your milk supply..is obviously feed your baby more, then your body will naturally make more milk to accommodate for your babies needs :)"
1,Placebo effect,"I took as directed for a week, then I even upped the dosage to twelve a day when my friend said that's how much she was taking. I was hoping to be producing milk by the gallons with this stuff(joking), but it didn't make any difference. The reason I know it didn't is because when I stopped taking it, my milk didn't decrease like everyone else said it would. The things I have found to help are leaving my baby latched on even when he falls asleep, and I notice when I eat oatmeal, i seem to have a burst in milk production. The biggest negative about this, and why I gave it a one star, is the HORRIBLE GAS it gave my baby, which i read about in another review. Once I stopped, so did the gas!!! If your baby suddenly starts screaming a day or so after you start these, thats why!!!"
3,Ikelite SPD Dive light,"The light is very strong for say 55-60 minutes and then drops off suddendly. I like the light itself but the duration is not long enough to be able to use for technical diving. In the near future I will be purchasing a HID light. It is smaller, last 4 hours, and 10 watts in HID is the same as 50 watts Halogen. I had the battery pack, so for the cost it was a good deal, but is really not what I needed."
4,You'll enjoy it as much as the kids!,"Fun to read and you'll learn from it, too! Told from the dog's perspective, you'll move through a typical day in Sarah's life as her faithful Lab Perry looks out for her with charm, affection, and a sense of duty. The dog's eye view of the world lends gentle humor, like when Perry faces nearly ubiquitous temptation from crumbs and ""street snacks."" The author lends her own humor, too, in lines like, ""although Perry was not much of a publicity hound."" The illustrations are simple yet unique. While the book alludes to Sarah and Perry's 300-mile trip from Boston to NYC, I'm hoping for a sequel that will go into detail!"
1,The fleecing of New Testament Greek Students,$185 for answers to Machens New Testament Greek text is a little exspensive on thelevel of gouging and fleecing.Pastor Derryl
4,It fits my Wrangler,"Installed on my 1990 Jeep Wrangler. It seals and locks, which is its only jobs. could be made a little more durable, but for the price I would recommend it."
2,disappointing...,"I really liked the attractive presentation throughout the book and the very user-friendly approach to all the material. It was simple, light and readable.However, much of the content is drawn from Franz Bardon's ""Initiation Into Hermetics"". The author goes so far as to 'borrow' the exact terminology and similar structuring. In this work, the rituals overlay the Bardon exercises.In no way do I blame the author - so many authors 'borrow' from Bardon without ever knowing, much less giving credit.Perhaps more wiccans/pagans/ceremonialists could try Franz Bardon.In the end, I was left a little disappointed..."
4,Good book on Sorcerery,I licked this book. But it kept trying to feed the reader the three fold law and morality. Which should be up to the adept to figure out for them selves not the author to deed them?
5,Beautiful and Dainty!,"Wow was the service fast and boy is the product beautiful! The pendant shines and the sterling seems to be good quality! It is simple and dainty , so it's perfect for everyday. I like the design. It's unique and at the same time very simple. I love it!"
1,Didn't care for it.,"I bought this book with another of the best resturant recipes. The resturant recipes was a winner, this one should stay with Grandma. Many of the recipes are so simple that I don't use a recipe to make them. Simple in the way that peanut butter and jelly does not need a recipe. If you can't make great mashed potatoes without a recipe, then this book is for you. One recipe says , cut up the potatoes, cut up and onion, add to pan, add garlic and sprinkle with olive oil, salt and pepper. Bake covered ,then remove foil to brown. Who would not be able to think of that without the help of a book? Secret Resturant Recipes, on the other hand, will help you master some of your favoite resturant dishes."
1,Worked....for awhile...,"When it worked it was great. So many options, all the different cooking levels for doneness, option for poaching, thought it would be a great little tool. It stopped working after a couple of months, less than a dozen uses. Guess I'm back to boiling eggs in the pan."
4,Nearly perfect,This replaced a non-electric model. The plastic knob invites picking up the egg compartment without a holder. Don't do it! Eggs were perfect and were retrieved easily but you need to use a holder.
2,POORLY DESIGNED EGG COOKER,"There is nothing ""Automatic"" about this cooker, it's just a timer. The instructions are confusing & contradictory.The cover design is poor. It's almost impossible to uncover without burning yourself."
1,Very bad product,I had a oster that was wearing out and I tossed it and ordered this West Bend. BIG MISTAKE!!!!! After a minute of cooking (yes I added the water to it) the buzzer started buzzing. Then it would go off then on again till you were ready to beat it with a hammer. Needless to say I sent it back and now the Oster is no longer available. Sometimes it does not pay to toss things out to quickly.
2,either under cooks or over cooks using their directions,"This either ovder cooks or undercooks, . You try their times as indicated. Does not automatically shut off. So I started using a a pan of boiling water, works just as well....."
2,Very disappointed,"I have had this egg cooker for only one month. I love the poached eggs, it cooks to perfection, as well as the hard boiled eggs. My problem is the cheap plastic parts. The plastic part that holds the eggs in place is terrible. The two handles fell off after 3 weeks. Now, there are 4 splits in the cheap plastic, which I have tried to fix with super glue. I will be contacting the company for a replacement part,and it better be metal and not cheap plastic, or it will happen all over again."
1,Fair while it lasted!!!,"I liked using the Wend Bend Egg Cooker while it lasted, though truthfully, even then, it was difficult to get the poached eggs as soft as I like them, and then yesterday after only two years of very light use (used only about 10 times), the device died. When turned on, you get the loud buzzer that is supposed to sound when the eggs are done. I would not recommend a product with this short a life! I take very good care of my cooking equipment/gadgets, and this should not have happened."
3,Good eggs but bad plastic,"The eggs are excellent which is what is important. The plastic trey for hard boiled eggs should be improved, mine chipped after just a few times using the unit. Not a big deal it still works but makes it more difficult to get the eggs out when their done. Standard shipping got it here in 2 days. good deal for the price."
1,a plastic piece of junk,"I bought this thing about a month ago and after using it twice the plastic platform that the egg holder is on cracked on one side, then when I washed it by hand it cracked some more. Then being VERY careful I used it again and the part that goes over the little raised portion that the egg holder sits on broke off. Mind you now, you only have to not touch this thing or something else will break. It's the cheapest bunch of plastic I've ever used. I'm not hard on the things I buy, and I recommend that everybody should stay away from this thing. Don't waste your money. One good point was that it did cook the eggs very well."
2,nice but...,"I bought this to make hard boiled eggs. It works fine for that, but the plastic tray that holds the eggs does not hold up to the heat and started cracking pieces off after 3 - 4 months and by 7 months was useless. In looking for replacement parts, I found you have to order the plastic tray, the aluminum poacher tray and the plastic measure cup and the price is $15.95 and then you have to pay $7.95 for shipping. I bought this for $30 (I can it for $28 on Amazon with free shipping) and to replace that plastic tray I have to pay $24. $4-$6 less than a whole new unit.I did contact west bend and complained about this issue and they did send me a replacement tray for free. I just hope it lasts longer than the first one"
4,Pretty good,"This egg cooker was pretty good. I bought I because my old one from the same company broke. Love that I can hard boil, soft boil, and poach eggs. They all come out awesome. The old version as better because the lid was easier to remove. The old one would also turn itself off automatically after it was done without making an annoying buzzing sound."
2,"Cooks well, but pieces crack repeatedly","Over the last year and 1/2, I have had 5 egg racks crack and a lid crack. While the cooker was under warranty, they graciously replaced 4 of the cracked egg racks, but now that the 5th one cracked and the unit isn't under warranty anymore. I will be looking elsewhere for a replacement. The eggs cooked fine and it was easy to use, but it just isn't manufactured well. I don't put anything in the dishwasher (because I don't have one) and I washed each piece gently by hand, so I think the materials are defective. I wouldn't purchase this until they correct the materials defects."
2,Oster is a better product,"As always the item was delivered in a timely manner, however it is not nearly as user friendly as the Oster Egg Cooker which was out of stock. On the plus side, the eggs do not stick to the poaching part, the cooker itself cleans up nicely.AS soon as someone has the oster in stock I will purchase that brand and give away the westbend"
2,Poacher,This is a basic egg cooker that is inconsistant in the softness of the eggs probably because the measuring cup is a one size fits all type with graduating lines for the number of eggs to be cooked.The poacher tray is not large enough for extra large eggs and is really hard to get clean after use.
4,Great Product If You Need to Replace Your 70's Model,"I bought this as a gift for my mother. She uses it 4-5 times a week. It was to replace an egg cooker that she bought in the 70's. I say all the time ""They don't make 'em like they did in the 70's!"" but I'll tell you what, this is pretty close. Would recommend highly if you like egg cookers."
4,Super Easy Eggs,"I've only used about ten times, but once I figured out the water levels, it's a piece of cake. We mostly poach our eggs and there really isn't any direction for poaching liquid amount, but after a couple of tries, I got it figured out. And, I've done hard boiled eggs and they turn out perfect. So all in all, I'd recommend this produce. For poaching, you should use regular or large eggs. Extra large or jumbo eggs end up running over the cups and can make the timer go off before it's done ... and it can give you a mess to clean up on the heating unit. If you eat lots of eggs, this is a very useful kitchen gadget."
1,Egg cooker,The primary reason for my purchase of this product was to have the non-stick surface for the eggs as I hated cleaning my old stove top egg poacher. These were marginally easier to clean but the automatically timer never did work. I decided that while I could time the eggs the old way it wasn't that much easier to clean and wasn't worth the room it took up so I gave it and the old one to my daughter for her garage sale.
3,measuring cup broken,"When my West Bend Egg cooker arrived, the special measuring cup had a small crack in it. It still held water. I did not want to go through the mess of sending it back so I used the cooker and it works perfectly. A few weeks have past. Now the crack in the cup is leaking when I use it. I looked for alternate instructions for a broken or lost measure cup (it looks like a vial with marks for the number of eggs you wish to cook. There are none. Where do I get a new measuring thingy? If it weren't for the cup I would give it 5 stars."
5,WEST BEND EGG POACHER QUICK AND EASY,I love the new West Bend Egg Poacher. Boiled or poached eggs in a flash without the mess or hassle. Eggs are perfect every time. The small compact poacher stores easily on the counter for frequent easy access.
1,not happy,"I purchased this egg cooker about 1 1/2 years ago to replace a very old yet still working Sunbeam. I was happy with the way the product cooked eggs, both boiled and poached. However, after about a year of use, the handles on the egg tray broke off. I've tried super glue, but that doesn't hold up under the steam. To replace, it will cost another $16 and I have to buy a kit with tray, poacher, and measuring cup. I am very disappointed that the tray did not hold up as the space left by the missing handles doesn't keep a tight seal to contain the steam. Compared to other egg cookers on the market, this was not a cheap model, yet it didn't hold up to moderate usage."
4,Great little cooker,"It's a small cooker but it poaches up to 4 eggs or boils up to 8 eggs at once. If you hate poaching eggs in a pan, I find this device quite helpful. It's better to use with large eggs or smaller though, extra large eggs tend to spill over the side. as far as boiling eggs I can't say that it is easier than using a pan, to me it seems about the same. Make sure you read the instructions before you use it."
3,Meh.....Great for Hard cooked.....Not so Great for Poached,This egg cooker is awkward in lifting the lid off after cooking.......watch out for burns. Does a great job of hard cooking eggs.........but if you leave the poached eggs in until the buzzer goes off.....you'll also have hard cooked eggs.
5,No problems after years of service,"I guess I have been lucky, going by the poor reviews of this product. Mine works well and has never given any problems--in fact, I came here today to order another one as a gift to a friend."
2,Design problems,"I was disappointed with this egg cooker because the design of it has a lot of problems. First, the poaching tray does not hold an egg that is considered x-large or jumbo. It barely fits a large sized egg and those spill easily too. Unless you coat it with a cooking spray, the cooked egg sticks to the tray and even then needs to be scraped out. Second, don't pay attention to the cooking instructions; it overcooks everything! Finally, my biggest complaint is the dome. Once the cooking process is completed; the dome is VERY hot and there is no way of gripping/removing it without burning yourself. Using an oven mitt does not help because the surface is slick and grabbing it from the sides allows the hot steam to burn your hands. This is an awful product. I gave it two stars because hard boiling the eggs is easier than using the stovetop, but I still have the issue of burning my hands when removing the lid."
3,50 Years of Progress???,"I can't imagine why this device is called ""Automatic"". The operation is purely manual. You turn it on, and then when the eggs are done you turn it off. It does make a sound when the water supply is boiled away, to let you know when to turn it off. Our 50 year old Oster egg cooker turned itself off when the water boiled away, and it would still work except that the base split in two when it was knocked off the counter. Oh well, that's progress for you."
1,bad egg,This does not cook or poach eggs in the allotted time; it keeps turning off without cooking the eggs in the amount of water suggested.
3,Good but could be better....,"this egg cooker does what just that...even boiled eggs..just have to get the hang of adding more or less water depending on how you want your eggs, hard, med or soft...to me it's the best on the market at this point that I could see...however, my OLD Oster cooker is way superior and I'm so glad I kept it even though it is over 20yrs old!!"
5,west bend 86628 automatic egg cooker,This egg cooker is great. My family enjoys eggs benedict for breakfast quite a bit (especially on holidays) and this egg cooker is perfect for eggs benedict. I love the fact that the eggs do not stick to it and it washes quite easily. Also the other great thing about this egg cooker is that you can actually cook hard boiled eggs or soft boiled eggs in it. It stores nicely and I would strongly recommend this egg cooker to anyone.
3,Not as Advertised,Times for different egg cooking do not correspond to instructions. When it states 3 soft boiled I had to experiment til I found a corresponding water amount to use. Disapointed!!!!!!
4,Above Average Egg Cooker - easy to clean,"I am an egg-cooker addict. This is my fourth. I like it quite a bit, second only to the Oster. If the Oster 4716 had stayed working, I would have kept using it.This would get five stars except for a few minor issues.The Bad:1) Softboiled: you have to really watch this closely (and experiment with water amounts) to get softboiled eggs...like most egg cookers2) Poaching: the poaching trays are a little bit small, some size eggs spill over3) Auto-off: Does not automatically turn off.4) Requires a proprietary measuring cup, instead of built-in water lines like the Oster. This isn't a big deal except that I have had these wander off in the past after I have girls spend the night over, and have them clean my kitchen.The good:1) Easy and consistent results2) One of the easier units to cleanI use this several times a week, it works well enough."
1,west bend model 86228 egg cooker a dud !,The West Bend egg cooker is one of the worst products I have ever purchased. It is made very poorly and very cheaply. The heating element is difficult to clean and often requires scraping the dried egg spill off of it. The main problem is plastic egg holder itself. This also requires hard scraping to be properly cleaned. It has broken and glued back together 4 different times. I am om my second tube of super glue. This has happened repeatedly over the 4 months. It also causes ripples to form on hard boiled eggs. I am returning this item. I would not recomend buying this unit.Herb Sherman
1,NOT RECOMMENED,"Unit does not cook eggs properly. After two weeks of following directions and experimenting with patience - I returned the unit and bought the Oster 4716 which cooks and poaches eggs flawlessly everytime, all the time."
5,West Bend Egg Cooker,This is the second West Bend Egg Cooker I have purchased. The first one was used so much that we just wore it out. It is a great devise for the price.
5,Wonderful Addition to Your Kitchen,We love the West Bend Egg Cooker. It makes perfect hard boiled and soft boiled eggs every time. We love poached eggs but had little success making them on the stove. Problem solved - the West Bend Egg Cooker makes perfect poached eggs. The buzzer sounds when eggs are done so they never get overcooked. Very easy to use and very easy clean up. Now we couldn't be without it. Thank you West Bend!
2,Use with extreme caution,"Although this egg cooker is simple to use and works as described, it has what I see as a serious design flaw. During cooking, steam is forced out of the small opening on top of the dome. A user like me, who inadvertently reaches over the dome, will sustain a serious burn, as I did. There should be a diverter, a label, or at least a written warning to protect users."
3,not done right,I purchased the cooker as a gift. The recipient has informed me that she has been unable to get eggs cooked to the specification listed on the gauge provided with the cooker.
2,mis-marked water cup,The egg cooker is about what one would expect but the biggest problem I have is that the measuring cup is marked backwards!!! The 'lower' numbers are on top with the 'higher' numbers on the bottom end. Example; you're using twice as much water to cook 1 egg as opposed to 7 eggs. Thank God this is a common sense issue. Any fool would know you need more water to cook 7 eggs rather than 1. But that makes it a bit of a trial and error issue to get the eggs you wish.
2,Not worth it,"Instructions are terrible. The printed numbering on the water cup is reversed, and they have the instructions backwards...""for more eggs, use less water."" Not true. Terrible quality control on the instructions. No timer. And the buzzer goes off at weird intervals; the water level sensor is very finicky. I basically ignore the instructions now and pour in about a measuring cup of the water, and just time it manually.At the end of the day a simple bamboo steamer, some ramekins if you want to poach, and a stopwatch does the trick here. No need to spend the $30 on this."
1,Eggzaperating,This is a joke. Doesn't cook eggs in any usable way. I followed directions to the letter and was disappointed with the performance. It's too expensive to use for a door stop!
1,Ceased heating after fewer than 10 uses,"The only adjustment for eggs is soft or hard. So if the eggs do not come out the way you like, you need to add less water to make them softer, more to make them harder; probably when the water is all gone, this causes the temperature of the heating element to rise and triggers the switch that activates the very loud alarm. You need normal or better vision and an eyedropper to fill the little plastic measuring cup to the correct level, or just keep spilling/filling/checking or getting your eye level with a dripping faucet. A few drops either way impact how the eggs come out.But really, this appliance failed after fewer than 10 uses? This is beyond 'cheaply made', just say 'China'. The reliability of China-made appliances is deplorable! Returning to Amazon for refund."
1,West Bend? Never again!,"I cook poached eggs a lot for breakfast, so when my trusty Sunbeam poacher got all corroded from years of use, I replaced it with the West Bend. First, the West Bend has a loud obnoxious buzzer to indicate when the eggs are done, it's so loud that in jangles the nerves, not the ideal way to start the day. Then, after only about a month of use, the timer started malfunctioning, going off when the eggs were still raw, and turning itself off even when there was still water in the unit. After having several breakfasts ruined by this unreliable appliance, I decided to order a new Oster. I wish I had never thrown away my funky old Sunbeam, at least it was reliable and built like a tank. This West Bend unit is all glossy, cheap plastic, but is totally unreliable. They should call it West Bend-over!"
1,steam burns,"I purchsed the West Bend 86628 egg cooker after my last Oster egg cookered quit working. I love poached eggs and was excited to try West Bend's model. The problem I have is getting the dome lid off without getting steam burned. Have tried every thing from mits to flipping off the lid with a butter knife. I really think this product needs to be re-designed, so there is a safer way to remove the lid without getting burnt. The side small finger grip handles are worthless. At least my old Oster, it had a big handle/knob on top that one could use easily, even with an oven mit on. I've been burned twice and have contacted the company informing them of the safety hazards. No results of seeing a better product on the market. I will not purchase another egg cooker from West Bend until they address the safety problems regarding this current model."
1,never worked for us,"Ever since we bought this egg cooker the ""soft boiled"" eggs have always been over cooked. The measurement cup is wrong. This morning I tried to use it for poached eggs and the timer would just go off after 30 seconds. We've had it for about 6 months and it's broken. What a piece of crap."
3,"OK, But there are better choices","I had this egg cooker for a year and 3 days over the warranty when it decided to buzz (egg cooking time alert) and never stop. It had one steam hole at the top and you can really burn yourself if you happen to cross paths while cooking eggs. It also seems to leak water out the bottom weep holes, when done cooking eggs, it often sat in a puddle of water. I replaced this unit with one less sexy looking, but better designed for egg cooking, easier to clean, multiple steam outlets and no water seepage - and no buzzer."
1,Didnt' like this product,"I was so excited to get an electric egg cooker. When it came the lid has no handle and it gets very HOT> The egg poacher trays stick. No matter how much oil I use, the eggs stick. I returned this product as unsatisfactory."
1,Too Small,"I found the egg holders to be too small. When I would pour in the eggs (Large, not Extra Large)the whites would run over and down into the water below. This creates a real clean up problem as well as messing up the cook times. I would not buy this unless there was a tray to hold Large eggs."
1,Fell apart after a few uses,"We had an Oster cooker for years that worked well. When we had to replace it, we bought the West Bend. The first problem was that the settings for poached eggs were inaccurate and we had to experiment to find the right setting. We could live with that, but after only a few uses, the plastic insert that holds the eggs and which must be used even with the poaching tray, literally cracked in several places and fell apart. It was never dropped or mishandled; it just cracked through normal use and fell apart."
5,Love it but it broke all ready!,"Love this little egg cooker, use it every morning for three weeks! Sadly though it broke somehow, the handle on the tray that holds the eggs for hard boiling broke off. I can get replacement parts for $16 plus shipping but it comes as a kit and it's more than I need. It still works just might have to cook past buzzer time because the steam can escape through the side where the handle came off:("
3,Guess I need more experience...,"I followed directions exactly for soft poached eggs, however, the egg was hard cooked. I stood over the cooker & made sure I lifted the egg out as soon as the buzzer sounded, as well as using the correct amount of water for 1 poached egg, but it still came out hard boiled like. I ate it, but am disappointed. Any suggestions?"
1,Awful.,I received this for my birthday and it started malfunctioning on the first use. I have experienced the same problem referenced in other reviews...the buzzer goes off after a very short period of cooking time. Save your money and boil water.
1,quit after 4 uses :(,Had an OLD one of these. Ordered NEW one. Gave old one to sister. NEW one was no where near as easy to use. It QUIT (buzzer keeps going off when eggs are not cooked and won't restart and work correctly. Pain to return. Don't do it. Hopefully They will write me a note with a suggestion or two to help me. I miss my easy hard (lol) boiled eggs.
1,disappointed,"We purchased this item on the basis of name recognition,however, it does not live up to the West Bend quality of the past.First,it is poorly constructed: Secondly,the directions for using the measuring cup are a bit confusing:Now,after only using the cooker 3 times,the ""done"" alert sounded 3 times while the eggs (2) were still cooking. In the future,I would be reluctant to purchase anything with the ""West Bend"" name on it. We looked at approx. 10-12 other cookers before deciding on this one. We will be more cautious in the future.On the plus side, once you figure out the water measuring cup,the eggs are cooked very nicely."
5,Egg Cooker,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She really likes it. I am typing more words so I can click submit.
3,Egg Cooker,"Bought this updated version of the West Bend egg cooker for my mom since her's finally wore out. The new version pales in comparison. Hard to tell when the eggs are done. It's supposed to make a sound when it's finished, but no one has heard it yet and it looks like it keeps on cooking. Everything is plastic and the cover is hard to remove. West Bend should not have tampered with something that was perfect to begin with!"
3,susette,the books had more ware on them than I expected. But over all they were in good shape. will enjoy reading them to my grandson.
2,Little Books,"Nothing wrong with little books OTHER than the visuals are diminished. I remember reading these books to my kids and the visuals are a big part, maybe the biggest part of the story. The bigger the picture, the better for little eyes. While these pictures are the same they don't make the same impact as the old large books.If I had it to do again I WOULD PASS!"
2,Cheap,These books are very thin and seem like one of those you get free in a happy meal (just a little larger). Dissapointing but good stories for kids.
5,Great Book,"Great book in great condition. Kids can learn letters, words, and reading all associated with interesting and funny stories. Book in good condition as well."
4,OLD MacDONALD IS YOUNG AGAIN,"With 22 years experience as a classroom teacher Charley Hoce well knows what appeals to youngsters. As he says, ""Children love puns, homophones, idioms, and anything that turns convention upside down."" He has incorporated all of these into a jolly rhyming book based on the well known ditty ""Old MacDonald Had A Farm."" It might be especially fun to sing the song with youngsters before reading the rhymes.Just watch children's eye light up when they see, ""My horse he cannot whinny. My horse he cannot neigh. My horse has caught a nasty cold. My horse is hoarse today.""Artist Eugenie Fernandes has crafted boldly colored whimsical illustrations that enhance each verse. Intended for young readers from 4 - 7 ""Beyond Old MacDonald"" is thoroughly entertaining with a little education thrown in, such as language skills that children may need to practice.- Gail Cooke"
5,This book applies to more than just baseball.,"This book answered the question I had had in my mind for years: How do players in sports and the Olympics perform under all that pressure and in front of all those people watching? Coach Dorfman's thesis is that baseball - or any other sport - is not just a game of skill; it's also a mental game. He proves his point with many examples - from baseball and other sports. And he breaks down the mental game into a dozen components. This philosophy is one that applies to many aspects of life in general. This is a persuasive, well written and useful book."
4,Good stuff,"Great book highly recommend. It shows you how to approach the game of baseball and how to prepare yourself for a game , but the information not only applies to baseball but to other things as well. Great book."
5,A must for advanced players,"My son was struggling in high school baseball, especially in key opportunities at the plate. He had a history of being productive at the plate, so this was rather unusual. It really looked like he was ""choking"" at the plate, so I did some research, and read many reviews of this book. I purchased the book and gave it to him, and he got right into reading it. Immediately he identified several basics flaws in his mental approach to the game. Just as immediately, he went on a hitting tear, hitting over .500 for the next few weeks. I then purchased a copy for my nephews (one a college player), and they both attributed their successful seasons in part to this book. Great book!"
5,a must read for the serious athlete,this book teaches the player how not to be their own worst enemy! Playing the game relaxed and in control lets the athlete enjoy the sport even more.
5,Highly engaging mystery,"Collateral Damage is an excellent mystery set in and around Washington DC. It's a good solid story with well developed characters, plot twists and turns and kept me going right to the end. Thoroughly enjoyable."
2,Inconvienent,After using the wipes in the supplied pop up container I am disappointed.The wipes work as expected but the cheaply made dispenser keeps dropping the wipes. This means you have to open the lid and fish out the next wipe which is clinging tightly to the ones below it.Poor design.EZ John
3,Works well but over priced for what you get (quantity),"Good product but very expensive. We are now buying the wipes from Costco (Kirkland brand) that are 1/2 the price and since they are all individual sealed containers, there is no worry that they will dry out as these can since they are a dispenser with refill system."
2,"Not soft, and","doesn't do a good job. I would not recommend, and usually I am the person who just says nothing if I am displeased!"
3,Carafe Drips,"This model makes good coffee, however, the carafe drips coffee onto the counter as you pour. The spout is either too small or too narrow. Everyone who has used our coffeemaker has had to pour their coffee v-e-r-y slowly in order to not spill.This is really annoying. I would not have purchased this model had I know this problem exhists."
4,Street spanish gets a thumbs UP!,"Street Spanish tremendously improved my vocabulary of street slang as well as basic Spanish words. I know more slang than my Hispanic friends! My only problem with this book is that the answers to the quizzes were not always correct and there were a few errors in translations. Besides that, I loved it!"
4,"Use it, but with caution","I've learned a lot of vocabulary from this book and it's amusing and well arranged. The fact that many of the expressions are not really 'slang' from the streets but just everyday 'colloquial' doesn't matter to me because they're useful anyway.On the other hand, as soon as I started using it where I live in Spain people laughed and warned me that many of the expressions in the dialogues are either never employed here or they are out of date. So I still use it, but with caution, and I try the expressions out on Spanish friends before I learn them."
3,It's A Slang Thang!,"What I like most about this book is that it tells you from which countries the Spanish slang words come from. That way I don't use Mexican Spanish slang when I am speaking to someone from Colombia and vice versa. What I don't like about the Spanish lessons in this book is that it does not come with an optional CD or Cassette in order to make sure that I am learning to pronounce the Spanish slang and Spanish words correctly. I also recommend the mp3 and pdf of the los insultos vulgares that come with the Learning Like Crazy course in Spanish. By using the two of them you should obtain ""una boca muy sucia en espanol."""
3,grandson loves it,"My six year old grandson put 'Bane' at the top of his xmas wish list! He was so excited to open it and Bane has starred in his action play ever since. So, making a kid happy, rate it way up there. Using one's imagination for battle scenarios, yes, it does that. Educational value, not so much."
2,"Decent belt, but...",The holes on this belt only go about 3/4 of the way around and then it is plain on the other side. That was very disappointing.
2,Broke after 6 months,"For $4 I guess I cannot complain too much, but it broke after 6 months. Wore right throught the ""Leather"" and the metal grommets popped right off. I did not wear it daily, mabe weekly if that. Very cheap, but again, it was $4."
1,Save your money,"First, I thought that this scorekeeper had a belt clip. It does not. I just found out that the scorekeeper with the belt clip costs $5.00 more than this one. For someone who wears tennis skirts or shorts without deep pockets, this is very inconvenient.Second, this device should have cost $5 - $6.00 at most. Paying twenty dollars plus shipping and handling is way too much for the cheap plastic. My kids have received plastic trinkets on Halloween that are more durable than this. After playing around with the scorekeeper for two minutes, some of the sliders have already come loose. I am predicting that they will soon break apart.I think that this is one of the worst products that I've bought from Amazon. I will just have to improve my mental scorekeeping. I can't see myself using this product very much."
2,score tennis,semplice se lo vuoi utilizzare ma poco pratico se lo vuoi utilizzare come giocatore perchÃ¨ ti dimentichi sempre il punteggio
2,Excerpts from a gardener's diary,"Some time ago, I read and remember finding useful information in Rosemary Verey's The Garden in Winter. I purchased A Countrywoman's Year in hopes of finding more of the same. This volume, however, disappointed. It is a short collection of paragraphs, perhaps diary entries, recounting life at her Gloucestershire home. Although dated 1989, most of the writing seems to have been compiled from the 1970s and includes notes on weather, calendar lore, garden pests and the continued development of the rural English countryside. No particular themes emerged from the collection, nor is there any specific gardening advice. The author's rambling ruminations were a quick, but largely unsatisfying, read."
2,Lost the scent,"I was delighted to find I could still purchase a favorite Lancome fragrance because it was not available in stores.Such a disappointment to find it is not the same fragrance at all - altered in a very bad direction so I cannot use it.It would have been better if the maker had named it Climat Two, or somehow indicated it was a new product, which it most definitely is. I have the remnant of an old bottle with the original, which is great."
