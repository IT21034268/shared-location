3,OK for Windows; Not for LInux,Bought this after reading mixed reviews. It works fine with my Samsung (XP) netbook but I was frustrated when I tried to use it with my Asus and nothing happened. Only then did I read that Logitech does not build speakers that are compatible with Linux!
5,Lots of bang for the buck,"I am really impressed with the quality and dimension these little speakers offer. I was looking for a set of portable speakers for my Gateway NV52 series laptop. These fit the bill perfectly. Not a lick of trouble installing, true plug and play. Comes with a durable carrying case which just adds to the value. Volume output is plenty loud if that's your game. Great product."
5,Best classroom speakers ever!,"You do not need a power cord! These slim,attracive laptop speakers are USB powered and come with a little carrying that fits in your laptop bag. They even have amazing sound for a classroom or meeting room. The best!"
3,Doesn't work on Toshiba L25-S119 with XP SP2.,"I've experienced nothing but trouble with these speakers stuttering after a few minutes of play. I've tried everything suggested by Logitech support, but nothing has worked. I don't think it's the speakers, though, because they work fine on my Windows 2003 Server computer. I've gotten all the latest drivers, but nothing has helped. I have to assume that there is an incompatibility with this Toshiba laptop that is not readily discernible. The speakers sound fine (much better than the tinny built-in speakers) up until they start stuttering."
1,Tried two sets: both failed,"I bought my first set of speakers at Amazon. They worked great for a day, but then suddenly stopped producing any sounds. I scanned the Internet and the Logitech support forums and found many users complaining about the same problem. Neither recommendation I tried helped, so I contacted Logitech, which sent me another set of speakers (it was really nice of them). Unfortunately, the second set did not work from the beginning: one of the speakers produced a lot of static (and the sound went on and off). I tried to interchange the speakers between two sets, but it did not help. I contacted Logitech support again and was asked to provide the pickup info for sending them back, but my ticket has been pending for weeks and I have not heard from them since. So I'm returning my speakers to Amazon. Judging by the number of good reviews, I guess this problem does not affect everyone, but it was too much of coincidence for me to get two sets of malfunctioning speakers. Buyers beware."
2,Meh...,"For the price I expected more. However, they are supposed to sound better than a typical laptop's speakers, and they accomplish that goal.The USB connectivity is nice, and its exactly where all your money is apparently going with the $50 price tag. They can't handle loud music at all and sound more like $10 speakers. Plus the volume control being two small buttons instead of a dial is annoying. But I will probably keep them since I had a rebate to lower the price.If you absolutely need a USB connection then these are good. If not, these are ok at best. I tried to use them to help un-clutter my desktops power strip, and promptly put them away and bought a pair of Altec Lansing VS2420 speakers that blow these away. The Altec speakers even have a normal power plug instead a giant power brick to plug in, which was the root of me changing speakers in the first place."
4,Slim & decent speakers but hissing at high audio level,"Its very useful as my laptop (Inspiron 1525) inbuilt speakers are not very effective and media controls at the speakers are good in controlling the player without getting into laptop (could have distinguished the button symbols in clear colors, very difficult to spot out each)Other than the hissing sound at high audio level, I'm overwhelmed on the performance at medium sound."
5,Fantastic value,The convenience of not having to worry about fresh batteries or an a/c adapter alone would make this a winner. The sound quality is surprinsingly good for the size and price. I have owned (and thrown away in disgust) several other portable speakers. These are a keep.
3,"Good sound, but a little weak on the base.",The sound is definitely better than the built in speakers that are on my laptop. I use it around the house or when I travel when I listen to music.It is a bit heavy to carry around if you are in school.
3,not loud enough in a vehicle,"I was disappointed in the speakers because I specifically purchased them in order to listen to movies, presentations, etc. in our conversion van since my laptop doesn't have very good speakers. Unfortunately, these didn't cut it in a van with the noise from the road, heater, etc."
4,a nice laptop speaker,"I just bought this speaker for my laptop. The sound quality is pretty good for a small room, considering the price after rebate.The handling, however, is not very good, especially these small buttons."
4,pretty good except for some loose contact,i got them in pretty good condition.But one of the speakers has a loose contact problem.Considering its refurbished dat could be ignored.
4,Laptop Speakers,"I purchased these speakers as a gift to go along with the laptop computer which was also a Christmas gift. The speakers offered a good sound for the price and the person who received them, told me she was very pleased with the available functions they offered. The only negative I found (hence 4 stars and NOT 5) was that the speaker wire that connects to the laptop is very short. It is very awkward to place the laptop on your lap, and attach the speakers. I happen to have an extra USB cable and it was used as an extension cord from the laptop computer to the speakers which were placed on a desk.I was very pleased to learn that in using the USB cable as an extension, the speakers preformed just as good and strong. So, I would recommend that you add a USB cable so the speakers can be placed safely away from the lap. I have also sent my speakers wire length recommendation to Logitech."
3,Good speakers,Good speakers. Not spectacular but good for what I use them for. Got them because of the price with the rebate but never got the rebate.
4,Great speakers for your laptop,"Let's face it - integral laptop speakers are just not made for music. These speakers have really good sound for their size. They are well-made, easy to set up (plug in to a USB port and you're done!), and have a very nice storage case. Occasionally they act up, but I've found if I just unplug and re-plug them in, Vista reinstalls the drivers and everything is fine. Overall I'm very pleased."
4,Two years old and going strong,"I needed a pair of speakers to go with my laptop (iBook G4) and I didn't want the hassle of an extra AC adapter, and these speakers fit the bill. Some of my friends have cute portable speakers that are very small, but the sound suffers accordingly (especially when they obliviously push them far beyond their capabilities). These may be larger than some portable speaker sets, but they sound great and the carrying case is super handy. My major beef with these speakers, though is the cabinet design. Certain resonant low-end frequencies cause the speakers to buzz and walk across my desk. It's annoying on two levels.Somewhat related: There's something funky with Mac's DVD Player app: Loud sounds in movies will cause the sound level to drop drastically and then gradually come back to the set level. I thought using the USB output might mitigate the problem, but this is the case whether I'm using the speaker output or the USB port. FWIW."
4,"Good Speakers, but not amazing","The USB convenience is one of the major reasons that I decided on this set. Saving an outlet is a nice feature for a laptop. As far as the sound quality goes, it's pretty good. The sound is much louder than laptop internal speakers. The highs are good, but I find them to be slightly static-y at times with some scratchy distortion (it's mild but noticeable). The mids and bass are average (but a drastic improvement over internal speakers). I find that if you put them on a surface with good resonance, the quality of the bass is improved. They definitely are a great improvement over built in laptop speakers. However, they don't sound as good as a nice 2.1 system of comparable price. This review is for refurbished speakers (but I don't imagine new ones would be any different)."
1,decieved,"After reading many of the reviews on amazon i decided it would be worth it to pick up a pair of what i thought sounded like some decent speakers to project the sound a bit more from the Realtek Hidef speakers built into my toshiba satellite. well after recieving the prduct set up was simple, plug it in, but i noticed i have power, and no sound, after trouble shooting and checking/unchecking just about every option for audio playback i looked around the forums on the logitech website about the V20's to find page after page of people experiencing the same problems, with no answers to the problem from logitech its being dismissed as a ""incompatibility"" problem that has no solution. i know logitech makes decent quality products but these seem to be a 50/50 toss up. My reply from logitech on the ordeal is pending so i hope they have some good costumer service to back up this sub-par product."
2,Compatibility issues in Vista and 7,"I used these speakers on Windows XP and they worked and sounded great. On Vista, they simply would not detect. On 7, they detect but no sound comes from the speakers. Other reviews on the 'net point to the same issues. If you are on XP, go ahead and buy these nice-sounding speakers. Otherwise, beware, they likely will not be compatible."
5,Exelente,"Tomando en cuenta su tamaño y que se alimenta del mismo puerto USB, me parece que tiene un sonido fantástico. Para mi es ideal cuando viajo para oir buena música en la habtitación del hotel."
1,don't sell any non-working item,"I bought Logitech 970155-0403 about a month ago. It was not a new one but I thought it at least works. But, I was wrong. It does not work. I have tried with three different computers but I don't think it is computer problem but the item which I bought from Amazon. I feel like I am a jerk. I paied for nothing but a garbage. I hope that this kind of thing never happen again in amazon. I have been buying many items from amazon. Everything was good until now. I feel very bad... this time."
3,Its alright,"Overall a good speaker, but for the $[...] I can't tell. (I got a $[...]) rebate.Good speakers as long as you keep the volume under 70-75% of its capability after that the sounds is DISTORTED.Anyone looking for really high decibel stuff keep away."
5,Great item,Great sound with buttons to turn sound off or down. I travel alot and these pack up easy and fast with my laptop.
5,Small & Sweet,"I was searching for something which is small enough and also does not need separate power cable and this is the perfect choice for that. It became very difficult for me with the speakers on my laptop to listen to all those beautiful videos on the net. Sound quality is good, it is just plug and play.Definitely Recommend."
1,Low Sound Quality,"The speakers look great in the web-site, but the sound quality is the opposite. When I turned the volume high, the speakers were shaking and producing very bad quality sound. So appereance might be deceptive..."
3,usb speakers,Logitech V20 Notebook Speakers (Black)Usually these speakers have good sound quality.It's possible to get a bad set sometimes.The second time I did get some defected ones but the seller was kind and just getting started in her new business.So I'm merciful because she's providing good service and a no hassle return.I will buy from them again.These came from FORT WORTH ANTIQUES BOOKS AND MORE.
5,Quite good for portable sound on a macbook!,I'm on a Macbook and I am quite surprised how good these sound being just connected to a USB port. Very good bass and soundfield. I think these are a great portable solution and great for watching movies on the macbook as the volume on the laptop is notoriously low.
4,fine speakers,"Yes, the hook-up to the computer could not be simpler. The sound is very good for a purely USB-driven speakers, and plenty loud for my office. The traveling case is cute and easily fits into the laptop case. The only draw-backs are that the short cords allow only for a maximum separation of three feet between the speakers, and the volume controls are knobby push buttons that are not very easily controlled. I would much prefer a dial. Aside from these quibbles, its a good pair."
1,They don't work,"I connected these speakers to my HP laptop (with Vista) very easily. Seemed to work fine. Then I tried a different USB port. No sound. Went back to previous port. No sound. An afternoon spent checking for drivers and connections, diddling with Control Panel settings, etc., did no good. I am returning them. Perhaps they were defective, but I'm not going to try the same product again and go through this hassle."
1,Lasted a few hours,"Like many other reviewers, the speakers started out fine, then just stopped working. The computer still recognizes them, the controls still work, just NO sound comes out. I wasn't even using the speakers when the problem started. An alert ""bubble"" popped up stating a malfunction and they haven't worked properly since. I even connected them to another computer, and they still didn't work. Buy at your own risk!"
3,"good, but basic","The big thing that is missing with these speakers is a LINE OUT! There is no way to use headphones when these are plugged in with iTunes on Windows Visa or 7 because it uses a single audio output, and won't output to the laptop line out and these USB speakers. HUGE MISTAKE by Logitec not to have a line out on these."
4,for general purposes only...,"These speakers are fine for general purpose only since most laptop speakers are too low to for you to hear from a distance, i mainly use these to listen to talk radio online so i don't need too much features. The nice thing is that the speakers are usb and don't require too much power. However, if you need speakers to listen to music that is heavy in bass, this is not for you, since the speakers tend to physically 'skip around' from the vibrations of heavy bass. So if you don't want your speakers to fall off the desk and you like classical, then these are for you."
3,Don't Sound So Good,"One reason I bought these is so I can hear television shows from the Internet better on my laptop. They are good for this application.Another reason I bought these was to mix and edit audio while I'm traveling. They are terrible for this, because the equalization is all out of wack. The mid-low range frequencies come in louder than everything else. Higher frequencies sound distant and tinny. I can get better mixes from headphones.Also, the buttons don't work so well. They're stiff and you have to pick the speaker up to use them.So if you just need a little boost when listening to music or playing video from your laptop, these will do the job. Just don't rely on them for production purposes.This being said, they're a little bit better than Edirol's USB speakers, which have the same problems but in a more extreme way."
5,AWESOME SPEAKERS!,"Logitech never fails to impress! I had never though USB powered speakers would sound so rich and vibrant. When using them I suggest you use a wooden surface if possible, as the speakers will resonate well, and due to a smart design the surface will serve to enhance their sound. VERY well worth the purchase, especially if the rebate is still in effect!"
4,Logitech V20,"These are great for the size, weight, price. Neat little carry case. But, if you want LOUD, these probably won't do it, as they like to dance to loud output."
4,"Cool, but a bit pricey for the speaker quality","These are some crazy speakers!So far it's been a simple matter of plug&play; on 2k/XP and changing the ""preferred sound card setting"" for Ubuntu Linux to work.The speakers *will* roam around a flat surface if you turn the volume up past 8sh or so. There's currently even a review with a video showing how outrageous this can be. But the sound is really good as long as you keep it a bit off the top range.I gave this product 4 stars because the bouncing action and static at top loudness. And also the price seems a bit steep. (To be fair, the case is nice. And for a laptop traveler that could be important.) Other then that these are great."
2,Logitech V20 Not Liking My MacBook Pro,"While the sound of these speakers is fine, I'm having a lot of trouble getting them to be recognized by my MacBook Pro. I plug them in via the USB port, and then I wait...and I wait...and I wait. Sometimes my laptop recognizes them right away, but most often I have to unplug and try different USB ports before the speakers finally become recognized by my laptop. Once the speakers are recognized by my laptop, I find that sometimes I have to go into the System Preferences and manually switch from my interior speakers to these exterior speakers, and sometimes it just switches automagically. :-)I'm not sure what the issue is, but I just wish I could find a consistent fix, instead of standing there for 5 minutes waiting for the speakers and my MacBook to finally ""talk to one another."""
2,No depth and short lived,"Even if these speakers had functioned for longer than two weeks, I would not have been very impressed. Everyone here has exclaimed how much bass they have, which is very inaccurate. Versus the laptop speakers they might sound good, but are overall very weak for the size.The included cords did not reach from one side of my desk to the other, and I do not have some obnoxiously large ""L"" shaped desk. The wires are ridiculously short.The controls mounted to the top of the speaker were very convenient, but nearly impossible to press. I would have to hold the speaker still and press firmly for the button to function, which then turned into more effort than what it was worth, and made more sense to grab the mouse.The only reason I didn't give these a single star is the USB convenience and the nifty carrying case. That, and I only had to drop a Hamilton on them. That would be a ten-spot y'all."
3,They've proved that man is the most dangerous animal,"I read this book while in Rwanda for gorilla tracking, and, as such, was really hopeful that it would give me greater insight into the history of Rwanda and the gorilla conservation movement.While there is much within the book that is interesting, I found myself so turned off by their continued sniping and disparagement of Dian Fossey's character (even in the pages immediately following her death), that I had to question their perspectives and motives overall. They struck me as ""Salieris""... so clearly jealous of her, her fame (which they have obviously never achieved) that their petty remembrances (she drank too much, she didn't give us wood) tainted the whole book. They were hired by her, clearly had a personality clash and then never got over it. Or perhaps they felt these tabloid ""inside scoops"" on Dian Fossey would help to sell more books?Either way, they have lost. They didn't seem like good scientists or good people to me."
4,Intriguing!,"Very interesting account of a life of struggling to save Rwanda's mountain gorillas, with riveting accounts of life with Dian Fossey. Brings conservation issues and problems truly to light in central Africa. A very smooth and easy read. Recommended for those interested in conservation lifestyles and those already in conservation."
2,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed with this book. The pictures of the designs are not placed next to the instructions, they are placed in middle of the book. All the pictures are grouped together on a few color pages (instructions and diagrams are in black and white). The pictures are of poor quality, multiple overlapping pieces of jewelry, laid upon muted ""postcard"" type pictures. This makes the jewelery very hard to see. Also the designs are old, i saw nothing new or innovated. I will be sending this book back."
2,small and missing litters,"A poor copy small and missing litters, poor picture, nothing special in this book, average drawing and text , if you looking for a book give you information about origin of our domestic pigeon this book is far away ."
1,6-bike parking rack,"First of all the box arrived so banged up, pieces of the rack were hanging out - it looked like it got left in the rain along the way. Second, there is no possible way we can figure out to rack 6 bikes on this thing. The product description said single-sided - that is impossible - the spaces are WAY too close together. We also tried it double-sided (which wouldn't work in the space we have to rack bikes anyway) but that didn't work either. And mountain bike tires don't even fit into the rack"
3,"This is a decent overview of physics, but I've seen better.","I am a physics and mathematics double major at Merced Community College, and I am in my third semester of calculus-based physics. I have been taught from are the two-volume series of the Serway text, and to say it in short, I am not greatly impressed. Chapter 34, on the electromagnetic theory of light, though it covers as much as can be expected in one chapter, is not mathematically rigorous in any way, shape, or form. I have no problem with reading the phrase ""after a little algebra"", but I do not believe it should be used in an introductory college textbook. The chapter on interference, ch. 37, could also use a little touching up. Other than that, Serway did a relatively good job introducing students to the broad field of physics."
3,"Top-notch music, short lenght","Of course there's nothing to say about the music, which is simply excellent. Motown was really the cream of the crop, and we can't say the same thing of many of the R&B; artists of today... sorry. But the lenght doesn't exceed 34 minutes. The tracks from this period were kinda short (only 2 of them exceed 3 min) so adding 10 songs would have been a wise thing.Still, it's an irresistible collection, and the only thing you will feel like doing when the cd fades, is playing the whole cd again.TOP 51. The Isley Brothers - ""This Old Heart of Mine""2. Smokey Robinson & The Miracles - ""I Second That Emotion""3. The Four Tops - ""Baby I Need Your Loving""4. Martha & The Vandellas - ""Heat Wave""5. JR. Walker & The All Stars - ""What Does It Take"""
5,A Touching Story,"This book is exciting and will catch your attention. It also shows a common boy showing true love to his sister, by risking his life for hers."
2,"Lovely monitor, until ...","I enjoyed this monitor thoroughly up until about a month ago (after having it for 13 months) when it started flickering. I was convinced it was a cable or video card problem because after ""jiggling things around"" and a few power cycles it would work again. Until now, where the monitor both flickers continuously and is very dim at its brightest level. After doing some research it appers that the monitor has a common problem with a backlight circuit. So no more Samsungs for me - and does anyone know if having bought it through Amazon whether its in warranty or not? I've owned the monitor for about 14 months now.Dave in Virginia"
2,Lasts less than two years,"Unfortunately, I had a similar problem as the other 2-star review. It's great until it dies."
2,Strong Vinyl Smell,The product pictures do not show the LARGE plastic warning label that is sewn (can't rip off) on the blue flap. It smells very strong like vinyl plastic. Something that smells this BAD can't be good. Yikes! I used a Snuggle Nest with my first child and thought I could save a little $$ by getting this similar product for my second child. Bad idea.
2,"NOT SAFE, NOT USEFUL","This item is not useful and I don't feel it is safe. I bought this item with the intention of having our new son sleep close to us. The item is not stable and turns to the side if you get close to it, waking the baby up and wrenching it to the side. Our bed is semi-soft mattress, maybe it wouldn't do that with a really firm one. Also, the tiny piece of mattress/foam that they have in there is ridiculous for a baby, its like having a baby sleep on cardboard. I bought this on clearance for only 12.99 and returned it 2 days later. Go with the bassinet or co-sleeper!!"
1,Sounds perfect,"Currently our 2 week old baby (6lb12) is sleeping between us in bed, and won't sleep anywhere else. We're worried about rolling over and squashing him, and this looks like perfect solution.So why won't Amazon sell it, or even ship it, to the UK?"
1,Portable Baby Beds? HA!,"I didn't care for this product.The discription was misleading,so therefor this product wasn't usable for Me.It would be better for couples who travel&let their children sleep wth them.It's made to be usd in an adult bed."
1,no peace of mind,My husband and I bought this because I was co-sleeping and we were both scared of something happening to our son. Unfortunately this product didn't not help us sleep any better. The velcro doesn't match up on it and it's really soft so our son kept rolling over into us. The bottom half of it has no support at all. It's just a soft peace of material. I would say spend more and get something firm
3,Not for us!,"We bought this thinking that it was a great safe answer to co-sleeping. Our son hated it. He would scoot down and end up hanging out of the mesh side on the bottom. He ended up just sleeping on the bed between our pillows most of the time. One great thing about the product is the night light, I used it constantly. This product might work well if you have a baby that isn't very active; we have no complaints on the quality of construction. We bought it for a friend who had a very relaxed little girl and she liked it pretty well, although more for naps downstairs on the couch. Overall we would not purchase it again."
2,not long enough,"It's way too short! My son outgrew it by the time he was 3 weeks old, and he's average length. Also, he rolled to one side in it. Big waste of money!"
5,Amazing.,"I found this product to be the best product I had for my newborn son. It is portable enough to move around the house easily. My son slept in the living room while I was able to get things done around the house. It then could move to his bassinet at night so I had peace of mind he would be in the same position through the night. I used this for many many months. After he became too long for it I took the positioner out and used that in the bassinet. My son is 3 now, and every friend along the way who has had a baby I always buy this for them. Every friend comes back after a month to express how great this product is. One particular friend who travels said this is great because she doesn't need to bring a pack & play. The light that comes with it is great because it is not too bright. My light still works and is used often to this day as I check on my son at night. This product is compact, portable, and built well. Well worth the money for any mom."
4,"great, but could use some upgrades","This is very lovely and quite big for our newborn baby (6.5 pounds, 19inches)- there is plenty of room for him in it, and plenty of room to grow. My husband and I use this in our queen size bed in the center. There are a few areas for improvement: we need more sheets with the special velcro! Once he soiled it in the middle of the night and there are no replecements! Does anyone know how to get them? The nightlight is nice, but you take it out to really use it. Note, this has to be used with parents having their own blankets on either side, as you would with any cosleeper. I would have liked more of an angle for baby to sleep at and more features of a sleep positioner. But I do feel it keeps my baby close and safe, like it is supposed to."
5,item as described,"the close and secure sleeper does what it is designed to do. it is nothing fancy but it does provide a nice sleeping are for baby. me and my wife bought it because our baby would not sleep unless we were with her. we did not want her in our bed so we placed her between us in our bed in the sleeper. after a couple nights of her sleeping like that we moved the sleeper in her bassinet and we havent heard a peep for a couple nights now! it was def worth the money, considering other sleepers that attach to the bed are 5x the price! i will say we own a queen size bed and sleeping was pretty tight, but it was well worth it in the end!"
3,It does have it's uses,"This was bought for us second hand by a well meaning friend. Unfortunately we can't cosleep due to a sleep disorder I live with that makes me unsafe. (Night Terrors) But we have gotten uses out of it. It's great when baby is fussy and we want him in the living room with us, we can just put him in the sleeper on the couch and we don't have to worry about him rolling off. We send it with him to grandma's house for the same purpose. Of course baby should still not be left unatended because when they decide to roll, some netting isn't going to stop them. But at least with this we can sit in our own chair in the same room instead of putting him in his crib.Overall, it's a nice product, but I personally feel it's overpriced."
4,Great idea!,"We love this co-sleeper. We wanted our new baby to sleep in bed with us but we were concerned about safety. This little co-sleeper fit right in between my husband and me in our queen bed (we are both medium-framed people). Some nights it felt like a tight squeeze, but it worked. We slept more comfortably knowing our baby was right next to us. We could hear her and see her and take care of her without leaving our bed. All three of us got a better night's sleep thanks to this co-sleeper. She is now 3 months old and we are using it in her crib to help her transition until she gets a little bigger. She is almost outgrowing it. I wish it had an option to extend the length (the reason for only 4 stars). This co-sleeper is also great for traveling - lightweight and easy to fold up and carry - no need to bring along a pac-n-play or crib. The sheet comes off so you can wash it."
2,Not safe,"I like that the sides are sturdy and it would be impossible to roll over on baby. It also folds up nicely for traveling.Problem #1 is that everytime the baby woke me up, he would be hanging out of the sleeper from the waist down. I never could figure out what was happening, but he would turn sideways and slip out. Also, the bottom half of this is not level with the top half,I think that may have caused the problem. This worried me too much, so after spending $40 I put it away with only 2 weeks of use.Problem #2, my baby was only 19"" and it was almost too small for him. There's no room for a baby to grow."
4,"Loved this product, and so did my baby.","I would recommend this product to any newborn parents, as it helped in transitioning my daughter from room to another - without waking her up! The nightlight is a pleasant bonus that allowed me to see during those AM wake up calls to check on her. The only con was that the ""flap"" at the end (by the babies feet) does not see to stay velcro'ed shut very well. It might be due to her little kicks all the time, but would have expected it to stay shut. At the end of the day, I just resigned to leaving it undone. Still enjoyed the product and would recommend it to anyone."
3,Cute!,"We didn't use this very much as our bed didn't have much room for it, but it was great for diaper changes. It is soft, folds easily, and is lightweight. The nightlight is a bit bright, but not too much!"
3,"Good concept, but did not work for us","The concept of this product is great, but it did not work for us. We have queen bed and with this between us, my husband and I were very uncomfortable.It requires seperate bedding for me and my husband - this was not very practical for us. We used it a couple of times and then stopped. For the times we used it the baby seemed very comfortable.This may be more practical if you have a king size bed."
3,Size a Little Small,There are some great things about this product and not so great things. First the product was great for traveling as it folded up into a nice size. The night light was the perfect amount of light as it was bright enough to see while nursing but not to bright as to wake up my husband. The down side to this product is the size. My child out grew it by around 5 weeks as he grew just too long so we didn't get a lot of use out of it. The other down size is that we have a queen bed. It was very tight having this in the bed. We barely had room to move around and slept on our side because basically all the room we have.
4,A Great Co-Sleeper,"I really liked this product - allowed me to be close to my baby boy and keep him within arms' reach during his first few months. Unfortunately, it is a little too short in length...my baby barely fits now, and he is only 3 months old (and only average in length). Time to transition to the crib...but I enjoyed having him close while it lasted. Also, although we only have a queen-sized bed, it was a perfect fit for baby and me because my husband has been working abroad...but while he was home, the three of us did NOT fit in the bed using the sleeper."
4,GOOD OPTION FOR BABIES THAT SLEEP IN BED,"VERY USEFUL. TOO BAD IT'S NOT LONGER, AS THE BABY WILL SOON GROW OUT OF IT."
3,Handy Item,"I intended to use this item after bringing my baby home from the hospital. I did for a short period. It's certainly handy, but just didn't seem very comfortable to my baby. I used it the first two months, but then I found my baby rolling to the side and coming out of the sleeper a little too easily. It's a good idea, just maybe not quite up to the standards I thought it looked to be. The sides are kind of flemsy and the bottom half that the baby's legs laid on seemed to start curving...just made it seem more flemsy for the price you pay for this. Definitely a handy item but overpriced."
3,Not Useful for US,"I understand the intended purpose of this thing, which is why we wasted money on it, but we only used it a few times because it was in my way more than anything. My daughter never fell asleep in it so it was an extra step to get her into it after she fell asleep nursing. Personally, I didn't feel like my daughter was any safer in this thing than laying next to me. Don't go by my review, though, if safety is a concern for you because you would know better than anybody else. I'm just the type of person who is annoyed by random things that maybe wouldn't annoy someone who likes to take every extra precaution. For that reason, I give it at least three stars."
3,couldnt use it much..,"Couldnt use it much, as baby dint like it at all, I think it is majorly because of the partition between the matress where it folds, it is very inconvenient/"
2,Really wanted to like this..,"Two stars for two reasons: this is a pain in the butt to clean up. You can take all the fabric parts apart and wash them (that velcro sticks to everything..) but it is a hassle to put it all back together. We ended up putting a waterproof lap pad over the mattress and a flannel swaddling blanket over that. This also took a lot of room in a queen size bed and made sleeping really awkward. None of us slept comfortably (baby included) so we ended up stop using this after a few weeks and putting this in a crib in our bedroom where he slept soundly and removing the sleeper after another week or so. Luckily this had a good resale value so we got rid of it, absolutely not getting it for baby #2."
5,Perfect sleeping solution!,All of our babies have slept with us. We tried something new with each one and feel like we finally got it right! The hard sides are extremely uncomfortable to lay on so it would be nearly impossible to roll over onto a baby. The nightlight is wonderful. It is so easy to check on the baby without having to turn on the bedroom lights and I'm able to see well enough to nurse in bed. I've had friends complain about their sleepers because their baby has slid out of the bottom of it and under their covers. Not with this one. The four sides keep the baby in one location. This is one of the best purchases we have made!!!
5,A MUST HAVE FOR NEWBORNS!!!!,"My husband and I just had a wonderful baby girl (Apr. 9, 2007) and I simply could NOT live without this item. My daughter loves sleeping in it.It is light; therefore, it can be easily moved from one room to another, as needed. You could easily travel with it.... from hotels to the ""Grandparents house."" It can be folded compactly and easily stored; and, there is also a handle for carrying. The light at the top is excellent for those who wish to co-sleep as well. ***Obviously, do not leave your child unsupervised in it!**It is excellent and I highly recommend it to ALL parents!"
4,Good fit for average sized baby,"I bought this to co sleep with my newborn son, this made co sleeping easier and is easily portable, it comes with a small mattress similar to a plush changing pad, the mattress is water resistant and has a cover that is washable which is a nice feature. There are two drawbacks for me, 1. My son was 22"" at birth and outgrew the 24"" soon ( the lower barrier is not movable) and 2. while the upper half is padded the lower half is just netted, my son had the habit of putting his legs out of the sleeper and would be half outside when he was a month old. Also this is just a co sleeper and not a sleep positioner. still I like this product and would buy again if they made it in lengthier models."
4,Good for co-sleeping,"I really like this little sleeper. It really does need to be put in a king size bed because it takes up a lot of room. The light is helpful. It would be nice if it was a little longer. My baby fits in it just fine but it may just work for a few months. I thought about ordering one of the others that is open but I was worried about the baby sliding down and not being protected by the side ""walls"". I think this one will be fine and I'm happy I chose this one. The one we were sent was white."
4,Very useful for newborns,"We are currently using this cosleeper for our newborn daughter. It is fantastic as it allows us to co-sleep fear free. I find the nightlight an additional bonus. Those first few days home I used it often. It's a ""blue light"" also so it doesn't wake everyone up when you turn it on. The only problem with the cosleeper is it's length and non-removable wedge at the bottom. My baby girl is five weeks old today and I'm exploring ways to creatively remove the wedge so that we can keep using it as she is now too long for it. In addition I will add that many people said that this must be used in a King Size bed. We do have a large bed but it does not take up too much space. We all sleep very comfortably. I can see it being used comfortably in a bed that is a bit smaller."
2,Not a great option,"My parents got this for our little guy when we came home for Christmas because we were traveling around staying at a bunch of houses. It's nice and compact and easy to transport. Two major problems though: it was waaay too short for our 2 month old, though he's not abnormally long. He had his legs bent all the way up to his butt, and he could not sleep at all. The mattress cover that comes with it is super cheap and ripped up in the wash the first time we washed it. Not worth the money."
3,Necessary Item?,"The concept is pretty simple, but I'm not totally sure it's a necessary item. Honestly, I felt like it took up alot of space in the bed (we have a queen sized bed) so if safety is a concern I'm not sure how useful it is to constantly bump into it while you're sleeping (perhaps waking up your child in the process?). Also, if you're a big tossing/turning type of sleeper where you'd need something like this then you probably shouldn't have the baby in bed with you anyway."
4,Great for paranoid moms! :),"I loved having my daughter right next to me in bed. She must have also loved it because she slept WAY better in here! She would sometimes get herself smooshed down in the bottom, or stick her leg out the side, but I still felt very safe with her in it. I think I would have liked it a little better if it didn't fold and the sides were hard all around. But that's just me...It made a good travel bed, too!"
5,Very delighted with the product,Ya.. I was very satisfied this one.. This was the thing which i expected the most.. I will recommend it for all...
4,Great for smaller babies,"This worked great for us, for a couple of months. I think we would have co-sleept with our baby if this would have been longer. I dont feel we got our moneys worth because it wasnt used for as long as we would have liked.That being said, everything else was great. The nightlight wasnt too bright but was bright enough to find a pacifier in the night.We used this on/with a queen sized bed. It cramped our style. I ended up sleeping on my side for the duration of use with this product. A larger bed would be preferential."
2,Not well designed,I purchased this for our newborn so he could sleep on the bed beside me. This sleeper has no support and you really need to have it on something perfectly flat and really firm (like a piece of plywood) otherwise it is saggy and twisted. I was also expecting that the sides would be taller and also that it would be wider as it didn't fit our baby for more than 2-3 weeks. Buy a bassinet instead of this silliness.
2,Not so gr8,The product is not so good. its good for small infants/newborns. Our baby boy is 21.5 inches long and he is not fitting into it.also the net on sides is cheap and baby comes out from his bed everytime. we so not recommending it ..its not that safe.
1,"Product should be called the ""First Month"" and not ""The First Year""",I bought this product for my three month old daughter to ensure her safety in bed with my husband and I on the times I chose to co-sleep. I have only used this product once and would not recommend it; I feel like I wasted my money. My daughter is currently 24 inches long and she is too long for this sleeper system. It does not adjust to give the baby more room so her head was pushed up against the top of the bed when we tried to use it. She was 21 inches long at birth so I guess this would have been useful for the first month of her life. Not worth the money to only be able to use for one month.
5,"get this product, not from here","First let me say one caveat, order this product from walmart.com, for $36. This price is insane. But this product is so fabulous, I had to write a review. Could it be longer? yes, that would be lovely... But this product enabled us to move our son into his own room by 5 weeks and he sleeps from 11-5 or 6 at 7 weeks, and then from that time again until 9. We used this in our bed with him in the beginning (we also swaddled him), then we used it with him in a co-sleeper beside our bed for three weeks (you could also use it in a pack and play), then we used it in his crib in his own room, and that's how we use it now. I recommend this product and swaddle mes if you are into getting a decent night's sleep as soon as possible."
2,First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,The sleeper was for my grandson at 8 weeks (15 pounds) and it was already too small for him.
1,"Despite claims, itemn cannot be washed","This will only work until your baby spits up or has a leaky diaper.The only part of this that can be washed is the mattress and mattress cover. The manufacturer claims that the cover is removable for washing, but only the top part is able to separate from the cover. The footrest does not separate from the cover at all. When I called, I was told the instructions that came with it were wrong, and they only recommend spot cleaning, which is not adequate for a spit up. They also told me to return it, but I cannot do that as it now smells like stale spit-up and cannot be cleaned.Get something else that actually works with the messy reality of babies."
2,Better options than this,"This item looks like a great solution as a co-sleeper but it is not. Problem #1: It's 17inches wide & only fits on a Eastern King size bed if there is a normal size parent on either side of this sleeper. Problem #2: Sheet is not standard & contains long strip of velcro that attaches to everything else in your laundry & has to be discarded since becomes tangled mess. Problem #3: It's interior is only 24 inches long, so baby quickly outgrows it. Problem #4: Exterior wall is very hard so parent's head can hit not to mention baby's head as well. What to buy instead: a changing pad that is cradle shaped to fit between the parents for about $25. It takes standard sheets (without velcro) & is soft, allowing parents to curl up with their baby while in bed & allows baby to still have her/his own space & be secure."
2,"Great idea, bad execution...","I bought this bed so that our baby could co-sleep with us. The top of the bed is very well constructed - it has a firm, secure edge around baby. The bottom half of the bed is simply some flimsy mesh and a small footrest. Simply put, this bed does not keep baby inside!! Even a newborn! Every time I would come to check on my baby, she would have slid halfway down, and her legs were hanging out the side. I do not recommend this product for use in an adult bed.That being said, I do use it with a sleep positioner in her cradle (where she is sleeping all the time now, at 5 months). She is very close to growing out of it, so we will then transition her to a full-size crib."
2,works OK but could use some improvements,"When cosleeping with an infant, this adds and extra sense of security. The top half of the sleeper is great, formed out of a rigid plastic tray, but the bottom half is just the this foam mattress with no support underneath. Because of this, it tends to cause a downhill slope, and baby slides down.We gave up on using this within a week, and just put him in bed with us until we could buy an Arms Reach Mini Cosleeper.The Close and Secure Sleeper might be helpful when used in a crib and when travelling, but it has limited value in an adult bed, or at least it did for us."
3,Good but very large,"We purchased this when our daughter just simply did not want to go to sleep in her bassinet. We were thinking that we'd be able to all get some sleep. We use it now intermittently. It works sometimes but other times she wants the closeness of my body, which isn't really offered by this product. I am, however, able to sleep on my side facing her and put my arm in the cosleeper with her so she can at least feel/smell me that way. But we do at times resort to simple bedsharing. Biggest complaint about this guy is that it's quite large. Would work really well in a king sized bed; doesn't work as well in a queen."
4,Great for needy baby for the first few months; also a great travel bed!,"Our son was so insecure for the first couple months that he wouldn't sleep unless my husband or I was holding him... we took to pulling our son into bed with us in desperation and wrapping an arm around him. When looking for a safer solution, I found this bed! It works great! I'm not afraid of rolling over on him, nor of him rolling over and face-planting on our adult bed. The mesh sides make it easy for me to lay a hand on him while he sleeps. It's narrow enough for a queen bed (just barely). The only negative is the foot bar--I wish it were detachable. I cut the mesh sides by the foot bar, which allows it to fold back a couple more inches, but it's still a little short for our 3-month-old. After a few months in this, he's transitioning well back into his bassinet!"
4,Great cosleeper,"This cosleeper is wonderful! Allows us to keep her close as well as give her her own space. Our baby has reflux, and having this allowed us to prop her up at an angle (which we wouldnt have been able to do with the crib mattress) and it has helped her immensely.Would recommend that it is used in a King size bed... it is a little wide to fit in a queen and have mom and dad in the bed. Also, I noticed that mesh sides are pretty floppy and dont hold her in on the bottom, but she likes to wiggle so she doesnt mind. Wish that the light was more effective tho... the blue LED really doesnt do much to help me latch her on an night to feed her."
5,This was very handy,"I used this item for about 4 weeks. It was very nice to have baby so close. My husband and I have a king sized bed and it worked fine. If you have a queen sized bed, you may be a little cramped. And if you have a full bed---forget it--one of the parents will be sleeping elsewhere! I liked the product, hope you do too."
3,Great but Too short!,"It is great but is too short! The yellow wedge is non-removable, and the baby outgrew it in less than 2 months! Boo!"
5,Awesome travel sleeper!,"My son loves this travel sleeper. It is perfect for sleeping SAFELY in the bed with baby while away from home. It is also great for sitting on the floor and using as a changing station. I've used it a lot since this is my family's first grandchild (we are going over to Grandma and Grandpa's a lot!). The only warning is that the sleeper is 24"" and the baby could outgrow it fast. Our son was born at 20"" so he will fit in it fine for good while. The sleeper even has storage pockets and folds up nicely for traveling. Buy this sleeper and you won't regret it!"
5,GWARRRRR!!!!!!!!,Gwar is back and better than ever this is by far my fav Gwar album nice to see them do an album with just the band no more odd members doing vocals that really only contribute to the shows I like all Gwar albums even Carnival of Chaos and We Kill Everything but this is how a Gwar album should sound Abyss of Woe is worth buying the album alone Violence Has Arrived is the perfect title for this album no more goofy songs all violence is how it should be
3,a reviewer from massachusetts,"al of the creativity seemed mostlly to go into the david brockie experience.the most gwar sounding songs,and the best songs on the cd are,2-battlelust,7-beuteous rot,9,bloody mary,and12,song of words.i think it's great that it was released when it was,no better way to clear a room,and house of unwanted relatives on bulls..t thanks giviving.although this may be gwar's last because it's easier to perform without costumes,i hope it is as effective on christmas......"
1,Did not work reliably,"My Rio Carbon died but I bought the store protection so I went out and bought the RCA Lyra because I wanted to spend a reasonable amount of money, 20 gig was enough storage space for my tunes, and I liked the FM tuner. I am pretty familiar with MP3 players this is about the 5th one I've owned.I charged it up and loaded up the tunes. However, it just did not work reliably. It took forever to find songs and then just froze all the time. I don't know if it was because I loaded up 14 gig of the 20 gig capacity or what but it just would not respond. I tried updating the firmware but it didn't help. It is going back to the store for a refund and I will try something else.Too bad because it came with lots of extras including a car charger, one of those tape deck converters for the car, lots of cables, etc... It also was pretty easy to link to musicmatch which was a plus because I use that. But unreliable stuff has to go back."
4,I don't see what the big problem is...,"Windows recognizes this as a portable hard drive, so in Windows Explorer, I drug my music files (only 1250) onto the Lyra (which took about 11 minutes). The booklet described the one simple step needed to tag them (right clicking on the Lyra logo in the active program bar and selecting ""Profile Device Contents""). (I do not use MusicMatch which is bundled with it). That took about 2 1/2 minutes. In all, I had my music library categorized and complete on my Lyra in less than 20 minutes.The only problem I see with this device that cost it the Fifth star is its size. Compared to other portable mp3 players, this is kind of bulky. But oh well, nothing is perfect.If you have the money, go buy an iPod. If you feel like saving a couple of bucks and don't have enough music to fill 60Gigs, buy this (after my 1250 songs, I've still got 13Gigs left)."
4,Great player for the money,"If you are in the market for a hard drive mp3 player, avoid the Apple iPod. The reason? Great players are available for less money. This player will hold a ton of music. The menu is very intuitive and easy to use, and the navigation buttons are instinctive. The RD2850 comes with everything that you need, including a case, cassete converter, line out converter, power supply, car power supply, and headphones. Buying these seperately could easily add up to $50. The battery life is great, clocking in at about 10 hours. To boost audio quality, it includes a 5 band graphic equalizer.Pros-Easy navigation-long battery life-includes accessories-huge capacity for the moneyCons-Software is not very user friendly, needs improvement-Occasional error messagesOverall, if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to the iPod, I would reccomend the RCA Lyra 20GB Jukebox (RD2850)."
4,"Solid performer so far, Mine is the 2826, but very similar.","I just purchased this product clearence at a local book/music store, and I must say I am impressed so far. 20 GB capacity is a decent capacity. the display is big, nice blue back light easy to read. I have figured out how to make playlists, and it sorts songs by group. you can drop and drag files to the unit, or use Musicmatch to sync with the unit as well. Works a hard drive on the drop and drag. It comes with everything from power/charger cord, connection cables to computer and stero system, and a case. Also headphones to boot. Software disc as well. Only drawback is that the battery has lasted me between 5-6 hours when loading songs, have not seen how long it last with playing only. Also, it has locked on me a couple of times, but the reset button works ok without wiping hard drive, but worrys me. Not a bad player."
1,Don't Get Tricked by Ad Language,"I had this product for a little over a year without a warranty. I used it primarily for MP3 recordings. It died one day. The buttons stick, its operation was confusing, manual confusing, nice screen. Not looking forward to getting ripped off by RCA (again) for a repair. Wish I had bought a more expensive iPod, it would have been cheaper in the long run and without the frustrations."
1,Magic the gathering: Tennis Match,"I played Magic the gathering Battle Mage for Play Station. It was the first experience I had ever had with magic. Now I have been playing the card game for a little over 4 years, and I love it. I thought back to the old playstation game and got really nostalgic for it, so I read this games review and thought it would be in the same league. Should have read the Customer reviews. The game is like a mangled version of Mortal Kombat meets Tennis. You pick up ""Mana"" balls that just fall from the sky and try to send spells over a middle line to attack the NPC. You can dodge, or block, but it isn't really effective. I would rate this game as for children 8 and under. Nothing about this game is in any way a reflection of Magic the gathering."
2,DO NOT BUY!!!!! SERIOUSLEY,"do not buy thisfirstly it doesn't even have instructions.just numbers that help you match things.like when two pieces go together it says 1 and 1.or 95 and 95.its not so bad but two pieces both had the same number and one was a decoration for the house and the other was a wall. it would be IMPOSSIBLE to fit the two together.it does this 7 times. i am twelve years old and it was sort of fun at first but then got hard. plus the things are totally mixed up. the pieces of the lamp in the front were split up on 5 different wood sheets.so if your trying to find somthing you have to look at the whole thing. evry single sheet, and let me tell you that is not fun.and the ""instructions"" are on the back of the of the box.and half the pieces didnt fit and stay togetherDO NOT BUY THIS"
4,Don't buy this on Amazon!,"What other people are saying about the quality of this model is true... it's not so great, but I had a lot of fun putting it together anyway. The only thing that made the poor quality okay for me was that I found it at a craft store (Michael's) for under $15. Sellers on amazon are asking close to $50 for it, and it's totally not worth that price. So, I recommend this model if you can find it somewhere other than Amazon."
4,Fantasy Villa,This was a fun project for me and my daughter. Can't wait to do more. We worked to get this together and now the painting begins.
1,mp3 maker 12 sucks,a worse mp3 ripper than mp3 maker 2005 & the install of mpr maker 12 disabled my older version that worked betterold version ripped at 60x new rips at 19x.old version will not work even after an uninstall & a restore to before the mp3 maker 12 install.avoid!!
1,Terrible Mess...,Don't think this could have been published if not for the Gethsemani name. A great folly and waste of paper.
5,An atypical introduction,"This Very Short Introduction is notable as much for what it isn't as for what it is: it is not an introduction to any repertoire, Western classical or otherwise; it will not tell you about scales, chords, instruments, or sonata forms; it is not a buyer's guide or a ""rough guide to...""; it is not a music appreciation textbook along the lines of (say) Copeland's ""What to Listen for in Music."" And this is a very good thing. Instead Cook presents a thought- and self-examination-provoking discussion of music as part of culture, daily life, and human experience. This extremely readable book is a valuable introduction to these issues that reach beyond the more familiar territories of the program note, album review, or newspaper diatribe about the corrupting influence of popular music."
4,Very Useful,This book provided with a very useful insight into the world of music. When I read it I was relatively new to the subject of music and this explained the concepts of it simply and easily so that even I could understand it. A brilliant book to get you started in the world of music!
1,Music: One Man's Opinion,"This is not an introduction to music in any kind of real sense. There is no objectivity here. Perhaps you're interested in reading one man's rant about all things music, but I was not."
5,Very fast,I received this CD in 3 days. It was packed well and the CD was in great condition. It plays perfectly.
1,no subtitle in spanish!!!!,I ordered these CDs as a present for someone who needs spanish subtitles. According to the item description the CDs should have spanish subtitles - but unfortunately that isn't the case. I was quite disappointed and the present lost its sense.
5,McLeod's daughters,This is one of the best series my husband and I watched. The story line is great and it gave us a whole new perspective about how the Ausies do a series. The writers are excellent and the acting is also so good that we were totally drawn into their lives.We bought it as a birthday present for someone else after we had seen the series and they too enjoyed the series.Iona
4,Ghosties,"The movie is not anything new considering the uprising of foreign ghost movies usually featuring a pale, thin girl with long dark hair that falls in her face and moves rather quickly. But the movie is very well done with good acting and nice pacing. I found myself at some points cheering for the ghost. The ending was very fitting and ironic."
4,SMILE...I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS PICTURE,The movie arrived in good condition and played flawlessly. yet another very good Horror movie from the Tartan Asian extreme collection.
5,Shutter movie review,Great movie!Great story!I've now seen the foreign & the american version.I really recommend the foreign version of this movie.
5,"Formulatic, but successful horror.","This film follows a lot of existing horror / shocker formulas. Unlike most other derivative horror flicks, it succeeds on just about every level. It's not the scariest film on the planet, but its very solid.Two thumbs up. I'm keeping my copy of this for showing to friends. it is easily among the best in the horror collection from Tartan Asia Extreme."
5,Always go for the original Asian films,"Why oh why does Hollywood keep remaking these remarkably scary Asian horror flicks? I mean, the American version of Ringu was equally scary as the original, but the others deserve an F. Ju-On: The Grudge, Kairo, Gin Gwai, and now this. ""Shutter"" is an absolutely terrifying experience. The Main Ghost in this movie is as creepy as Sadako from ""Ringu"". She's THAT scary. The smart scare techniques really work. And I'm really glad that I don't have to watch the American remake (which I heard recieved negative reviews from both critics and audiences). Hell, I'm glad that I don't have to watch ANY of the American remakes (One Missed Call, The Eye, Pulse, Dark Water, etc.)P.S. I keep hearing rumors that Hollywood is continuing on remaking Asian films. Have we really run out of ideas for a ""good"" Hollywood movie?"
5,Cuter in Person,"You can't actually tell in the pictures, but the cover is made of neon rubbery material and the purple stripes are actually raised from the surface. It's a lot cuter in person and it's so tiny!"
3,handy,I made the mistake of letting a buddy use a torx bit from this set (said buddy is known to be hard on tools). he chipped and rounded it off on his first try. it still works and it is a great loner set. good price. has most sizes for american cars. would recomend for home use.
3,Too small,I was disappointed when I opened the box to find a small jar with all the money crammed in. I could not get it all back in after taking it all out. I had to transfer everything into a larger jar that I happened to have in my home. I think I was better off to get play-money in a tray so that it could stay separated. This is just a big mess.
2,"Not bad, but inadequate","It isn't a horrible shoe; I've put up with a lot worse. However, here are the cons:-Needs more arch support.-Slightly less attractive in person.-A bit mesh-happy; I'd be concerned about its durability.If you're looking at this shoe, though, you might as well check Amazon for the Active Trail Mesh GTX. It's basically the same, but Gore-Tex is a marvelous product, and the Mesh is slightly lighter than the Pro."
2,I returned them,"I ordered these shoes after checking them out in a retail store in Taos. They were mcuh cheaper in price through Amazon. I must say, I only wore these shoes around the house as I was not sure if I'd keep them. The tread seemed exceptional, and so did the weight. However, I noticed a lot of flex due to the lace system, and this flex rubbed against the top of my foot in an annoying manner. I also noticed that where the shoe met my outer ankle, it seemed rather abrasive. So, I returned them, though I love the cncept of the shoe and may not have given them a fair shake."
5,Most Instructive,I never knew the impact the name of Jesus has. Dr. Coomaraswamy explains well the difference and the interface between a person's will and his knowlenge.
3,"An OK book, but draw your own conclusions","I can't fully agree with the glowing reviews which other readers have given this book. Yes, the author does dispel some misconceptions about `Operation Typhoon' and the subsequent Soviet counter-offensive - regards the weather, Soviet reinforcements etc.However, his description of Hitler's strategy as 'militarily sound' in the introduction coupled with his strong criticism of the operational decisions taken by some of the German generals leads me to question the author's judgement.There is also one GLEARING OMISSION in the author's account - namely Hitler's strict order that NO GERMAN SOLDIER was to enter the Soviet capital - the city was instead to be besieged and then literally raised to the ground by aerial/artillery bombardment.I think this is an important (and hardly ever discussed) reason why the Wehrmacht did not take Moscow in 1941!!!"
3,Is it me?,"Did I read the same book as the rest of these reviews? I like Harvey Mackay and enjoyed Swim With the Sharks, but I thought this book was a fairly simplistic brain dump of cliches and unoriginal thoughts. I do believe Mackay's geniunely decent nature come through and most of the concepts were fairly well presented, but I found very little here I hadn't already heard. I kept thinking to myself that this was Harvey's publisher squeezing out another book under contract. Sorry."
5,Entertaining and Educational,Mostly geared towards leadership in the sales industry; but even a techno-weenie like me got a lot out of it!
4,Great Monitor !!!,I bought this monitor and was very suprised !! Reception is crystal clear and have not had a problem with it. I had previously purchased the Fisher-Price Sounds &amp; Lights and those were just terrible.I had pretty much given up on having monitors in the nursery but decided to buy these after reading the reviews . GREAT BUY !!! Trust me even in the shower you get the crystal clear reception. I strongly recommend these.
4,Buy the PSR-295 AD with separate stand,Raj - thanks for your note on the AD vs. MD versions. The stands provided by Amazon with MD do not fit correctly. (The real yamaha stand is L-2C which threads to the bottom so the whole unit can be moved about. L-2C stands are not available in the US anylonger.Double X stands at Amazon seem to be the way to go - for only $21.00. What a great value.
3,Good for Byron Katie fans,"Byron Katie certainly has endured difficulties in life and has used these challenges to help others find their way. So if you are a follower of Byron Katie, you will enjoy this CD."
5,Awesome awakening.,This CD is awesome....has it all...all you need or want to know about Thework. It wont change your life after hearing it....YOU will!!!!!!At $20 Its as good as free! Treat yourself.
5,Seeking Enlightment...?,"Byron Katie! Amazing! If you really listen to this CD and do ""the work"", your life will change and you will be the master of your own universe."
5,Bassoon book,"This book is very cute and funny. The pictures are hilarious and add a lot to the story. As a bassoonist,I think the best thing about this book is that Ralph plays the bassoon. Just try to find another picture book with a bassoon in it!"
2,Nothing attractive.,"""Analog Signal Processing"" is not about analog signal processing and it is not about analog circuit design either. I don't think its title is consistent with its contents. This book is kind of broadband, however, it does not cover anything in depth. It is full of boring formulae and figures. It cannot be used as a textbook, maybe it can be used as a handbook."
4,Thanks for this book,"Not sure what to write about here. Book was needed for Master's class I just started so it was good to see it still available. Ordering process was easy and for this book, very timely. I think it only took 4 days to come in. I hope to use it the entire time as a resource while I am in school."
1,"Bait and switch, never returning to Amazon again!","I was sold the book under the impression this was either the most recent edition, or at least one less then 2 decades old! They sent me a version from 1978! Needless to say this is useless for my class and I will NOT be using Amazon.com for ANYTHING ever again. What a disgrace."
3,A Dense Read,"Very dense material... made me want to fall asleep while reading! Informative, nonetheless.My main complaint is the authors' overt ideological beef with Republicans and Republican policy. It's pretty biased for a textbook."
4,A good basic text.,Up to date and relevent. It gets to the point: a nice change if pace in a textbook.
3,Informative yet boring,"The book once gone over in laymans terms by the professor is very informative, but could have been broken down in a less complex way. The book gets boring fast and that is not good for students trying to study and major in the subject. Schools should look into other text books before grabbing this one."
3,"Great text, poor textbook","I am halfway through this book and hope that the publisher addresses a few things in their next edition, but most importantly: the footnotes are HORRIFIC! There are just pages of footnotes at the end of the book with no heading with what chapter they are from, seriously!"
1,Public Administration in America,Book never arrived when scheduled. When i followed the response I got was it was lost in the mail. So i had to scramble to find another book. I was able to get a full refund right away.
4,Hard to find,"We've been searching for the song, ""I Like to Surf"" since our honeymoon in Hawaii 10 years ago. Little did we know that it was a locally produced song, on this local radio station-produced CD. Glad we found it. The rest of the album is an interesting mix."
3,"Fun, but really only focuses on learning locations of African countries","I enjoy playing this game with my children age 8 and 10. They also like it by the way. I was a little disappointed that the only geography learned is the locations of the various African countries. I do feel confident playing this game will teach us those locations, but it would have been cool if we also learned a few tidbits about each country as well."
4,Learn geography while having fun,"First off, I must say that I am TERRIBLE at geography. For me, this game was a good excuse to learn geography under the guise of a fun game.Gameplay wise, it involves geography and spatial reasoning. You have to arrange your trip through the continent of Africa by exchanging cards one at a time to end up with continuous countries or appropriate transportation. The game plays well with 2-4 players, and unlike many games is just as fun with 2 players as a group.Over time you do get more familiar with the countries. My folks have every edition of this game and we often play it with them. It is a little too difficult for younger children, but pre-teen or older this is an ideal game to develop spatial reasoning, learn geography and have a great time."
5,Homeschooling a 13-year old,"I bought this game to supplement my daughter's daily map assignments on Africa. She is homeschooled, and I am very happy with this product. In addition to filling in a blank map of the continent every morning, we play this game every couple of days, and on the days we don't, she puts together the Africa Geopuzzle. I have been happy with how quickly she seems to be learning where all of the countries are located.The game is colorful, durable and easy to set up and break down. I like that we can play a quick game in between other assignments and it doesn't take a lot of time away from instruction. Because of the success we've had with this product, I am interested in purchasing the other ""10 Days"" games."
5,Simple but super fun!,"This game is a blast! We are a family of huge gamers and loved adding this to our collection. It's got a similar feel to RACKO (in that you organize the order of things) but adds some new challenges. You can learn how to play in 5 minutes and the games only take about 20 minutes... but allow more time, you'll want to play over and over again! I'm sure everyone in my family will have one by Christmas."
3,stingy on trays and pieces,"There are not enough trays and pieces for more than 4 people, not worth the money.choose another country or game"
5,"Fantastic, top-of-the-line game","I can echo what all the other reviewers have said: this game is fun for pretty much everyone. It's easy to set up, easy to learn, and there is just the right combination of luck and skill. Also, you will find yourself watching the news and saying things like ""Mauritania! That's the blue country up in northwest Africa...doesn't it border Mali?""If you'd like a slightly harder game (once you've played 100+ times you might want some variety): instead of selecting each tile and choosing where to place it, simply place each tile in chronological order (day 1 through day 10) in the beginning of the game. Makes it a little tougher to win when you have 5 airplanes in a row to start the game. :) I've also heard about enterprising veteran players using three tile-holders each and playing ""15 days in Africa"". Haven't tried that one myself...yet."
3,Lights not bright enough,"The lights were not bright enough for me so I returned it, it did test the cable. I even used a short patch cable to see if the lights would be brighter but they weren't."
3,Recieved One ordered Two,The one book is in good condition but I ordered two and recieved one.Please advise Why?
2,I Have Always Depended on the Kindness of Good Writing,"I was thrilled to discover a book dedicated entirely to the history of this seminal piece of theatre. Imagine my disappointment when I found the author constantly injecting himself into the proceedings and peppering his prose with cheesy ""insights,"" mainly about Brando's sex appeal or catty tangents that don't further one's understanding of the play/film. The editors must have been asleep at the wheel on this one as the book hopscotches around and, sadly, gives short shrift to the actual writing of the play. Ultimately the title's promise of something ""Scandalous"" is never really delivered, aside from some scandalously bad writing. The upside to this book is that it is meticulously researched and does contain some revelatory moments, especially interviews with long-forgotten actors, designers and behind-the-scenes players that helped shape the legend of ""Streetcar."""
2,Mr. Skaggs makes a wrong turn.,"Mr. Skaggs made reference to my novel, SEARCHING FOR BLANCHE, with a condescending nod to the problem of agoraphobia. How could my character ride a train from Atlanta to New Orleans when she could barely leave the house, he asked. If he'd read a little further Mr. Skaggs would have learned that she left in the company of her best friend and constant companion, Mister Vodka. Kept hidden in her purse in a bottle of Scope, Mister Vodka provided comfort and solace. Until she meets a certain cabbie named Art."
5,Blanche Met Brando & Made History,"I'm a theater buff so to get the ""inside information"" on this classic ""coupling"" is priceless...[plural couplingS is more accurate]...the chapters are brief and concise which is a plus for me...authors who have to drone-on...and on...cause me to flip fast through pages. The big challenge for me and NOTHING against the author OR Jessica Tandy was imagining Tandy as Blanche since Vivien Leigh as Blanche is branded in my brain. No matter: this is a must-read for theater history fans."
1,What a waste,"Simply put the book and exercises are a joke, dont waste your hard earned money. You can find the same stuff online for free. I mean one exercise is to rub your belly and pat your head at the same time. You serious?"
3,Better Vision,"It works I quess.It hasn't done any mircles for my vision, I don't think it will either.It's A good book thou.GLAD I BOUGHT IT."
1,5 out of 5 star reviews? yeah sure,"11 people reviewed this book prior to me and found it absolutely amazing, the miracle cure yada yada yada bee bop!Yeah sure.This book is all the same as the others.I just hate when marketers get into these reviews.Eat carrots, it may imporve your vision too."
5,Doctor recommends The Program,"I will be 79 this summer and have been coping with glaucoma for 12 years. My doctor recommended that I try the techniques in The Program for Better Vision, which he said could help to improve circulation, which in turn can lower intra-ocular pressure. This seems to be happening and my last 'vision field' tests showed remarkable improvement - some of my lost peripheral vision has returned.I'm extremely gratified that I found your book."
3,A solid modern opera,"Generally hailed as one of the best recent American operas, Bolcolm's take on Arthur Miller's play has all the ingredients of a traditional opera -- tragically flawed characters, soaring melodies, even a revenge aria -- and yet strikes a thoroughly modern chord, its dynamic score underlining themes of family dysfunction and incest. Drawing from a eclectic palette that serves to support the characters rather than bury them, Bolcolm's music moves deftly through an emotional and stylistic landscape, from jazz to lyricism to dissonance. Although the beginning of the opera is a bit talky, the arrival of Rodolpho brings a wonderful Italian tenor into the mix, his spirited voice soaring above the Brooklyn dockworkers and pulling the opera along to its tragic conclusion."
4,for high speed applications,"The topics discussed in the book are exciting. Most could potentially be the basis of commercially important products. Like using quantum dots in solid state lasers. For whatever applications might arise, a high speed usage is likely. Hence the significance of the short time scales of the phenomena described here.In case you are wondering, there is little useful in distinguishing between the ""semiconductors"" and the ""nanostructures"" in the book's title. Rather, the latter is a pragmatic acknowledgment of the current trendy buzz about nanotechnology. So when structures like quantum dots actually do fall within the nanometer range, then using terms like nanostructures helps get funding. (Or readers to get this book.)"
5,Daily Wisdom from the Bible,"I love this book! I actually look forward to this devotion time rather than facing it as a have to. The applications are very interesting and give just the right spark for a short journal entry. I plan to give several for Christmas gifts. As the year is nearing an end, I can look back over the year and give thanks for all the prayers that have been answered while I have journaled. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Disappointing,"The songs on this CD feel flat. They're a little preachy, lack melodic or verbal hooks, and boring."
5,Could not hold back from laughing but I really wanted to...,"The issues Sharpnack brings forward through his editorial cartoons show incredible intelligence. Sharpnack is very direct in tackling some political issues that others throw soft balls at. Regarding his ability to use metaphor in cartooning I know of none better. I look forward to more of Mr. Sharpnack's work to be published. Even if one would not agree with his positions one will find him or herself thinking, laughing or deeply offended by his work...and the later may provide the compliment that he is a true editorial cartoonist."
2,Extremely Lacking....,"This album lacks many of Bolton's best and biggest songs. For example, ""Soul Provider"", ""Steel Bars"", ""Ain't Got Nothing If You Ain't Got Love"", ""I Found Someone"", ""Go The Distance"", and ""Only A Woman Like You"" are not on here. Of course they're not his biggest, but they're certainly more important than ""Drift Away"", ""A Whiter Shade Of Pale"", and ""My Girl."" Those aren't even his songs, and they made no significant impact on his career. I feel like there are songs that were a big part of his career that should've been included that were left out to make room for second rate covers. Now don't get me wrong,Michael Bolton is my absolute favorite singer, and i know his career like the back of my hand, but this is just a terrible compilation, if it can even be called that."
5,A Great Collection,"Making women swoon with his good looks and soulful voice, Bolton was a major pop star in the 1980s and '90s, winning Grammys and selling millions of records then and even now.In 2006, Sony BMG began their release of the Collections catalogue. Artists that were featured included: John Farnham, Nina Simone, Frank Sinatra plus many more including, Michael Bolton.The Collections Album showcases ten of Bolton's best recordings with When A Man Loves A Woman; Said I Loved You... But I Lied; How Am I Supposed To Live Without You and also features some rare recordings that over the years have been overlooked in the many releases of Greatest Hits albums with great songs like Drift Away; Whiter Shade Of Pale; My Girl & Once In A Lifetime which truly showcase the diversity of this great artist.This collection is a great addition to any CD collection and a great starting point for anyone new to Bolton's amazing career. Bolton fans should not be without this one!!"
4,Better than the first edition,"While there is a huge number of game players, there are few good books to help you play. This is better than the original edition. It includes many of the changes made by the game creators since the earlier release.Pros - This is the best book published for starting players of Everquest II. (Unfortunately, perhaps because of copyright laws, it is pretty much the only definitive book on Everquest II.)Cons - mentioned by other reviewers. In an attempt to be artistic, the authors of the book created colorful maps. Unfortunately, the map colors make it more difficult to find anything on them because of the low contrast between the type and the graphics. (This is even worst in the Prima Official Atlas.) Don't these people know many players play by the light of their monitors?"
2,Quick info at hand,"The instruction manual in EQ2 is quite addiquate regardless of class. Things you are not sure of are learned as you go or you can post on numerous forums for answers.Since there are stats on top of stats and such vast areas with tons and tons of resources and itesm to be had, this book helps you get an idea of the ""where"" and ""what"". As in where you may find X or what Y actually does and realated stats. Its a reference guide. But as this game is so dynamic, this book has a limited lifspan and as you develop in the world you will find it to be ""old news"" rather quickly."
5,OTC 6135 9-Piece Universal Brake Caliper Bit Socket Set,The Socket Set was just what I needed. It is perfect.and A great price.Garry
5,Good purchase,"These will enable my granddaughter to make more projects with some of the Perler kits she already has, so she was pleased."
5,Good book for teachers and students,I found this book to be excellent for the classroom. The author supports teaching art to children by grounding her methods in current learning theories. I have had students tell me that they enjoyed the many stories of real classroom experiences that the author shares throughout the book. It is a good resource and inspiration for those who want to teach art to children.
2,BORING..,I had this book for a curriculum and instruction class and I could not stay awake for more than two pages. The chapters are extremely long and often repeat the same information.
5,Montalbano,"I love the Montalbano DVD's. I have purchased them all and they are witty, amusing, well acted and well produced."
5,Great book and lots of information,"I live in Southern Illinois and my wife and I often ride our motorcycles throughout Southern Illinois and Northern Missouri. We often pass through areas where you can tell there used to be something buit it has long since been torn down or abandoned. A lot of these towns and ruins are explained in this book and it was pretty cool to know the history of these towns. I would suggest the author do a follow-up to this book with the history of many of the small towns in Illinois. There are many great places to see in Southern Illinois and Northern Missouri. Lots of old history and heritage. If you are a history buff or are just curious about the area around you in Southern Illinois, definitely purcase this book for some insight."
2,Disappointed!,"Based on reading about awards received by Kuerti recordings of the Hammerklavier Sonata, I obtained this CD with much expectation that I would be filling a space in my Beethoven collection on CD. Alas, the engineering of the audio - particularly focused on the Piano as instrument - is so poor that no meaningful appreciation of the artist can be made. Despite a 2003 recording date, the sound is muddy and the music, even on melodic lines, is hesitant."
5,"""The Skinny""",Great product. Easy and inexpensive upgrade from 4.0. Aided my upgrade from OS 8.6 to OS 9.1 immensely. 5 thumbs up
4,"Good Model, marginal replay value","One of the first titles created by Red Storm Entertainment, the game accompanies a book of the same name. The game is really fun and is just deep enough to provide a complex strategy underlining a fair-to-challenging difficulty curve. The maps are all based on the same model with slight variations though, and after 4 or 5 levels you have a feel for ""best"" strategy and it becomes a game of predictability. There are a few things that are very effective (Security & Computer Departments) and a few that are less so (like Legal Departments). The best part is that there is very little chance involved in most decisions; it is instead very calculated with an equal reaction for every action. This 13-year old title (as of this review) still has a place as one of the most valuable titles produced by Red Storm."
5,GOOD FILM.............,"THIS IS A GOOD STORY DEPICTING THE 80""S LOOKING BACK AT 60""S GROUPSWITH A GOOD PREMMIS OF A DAD AND SON HAVING PROBLEMS GETTING ALONGAND THEN WELL I GUESS YOU WILL JUST HAVE TO WATCH THE MOVIEAND SEE THE TEENAGERS,SCREAMIN JAY HAWKINS, THE ELEGANTS ,SINGING LITTLE STAR ETC ETC"
3,Joey,I got this as a present for my friend who wanted so much to see this movie. I never heard of this movie before I bought it and haven't seen it yet.
4,tells it like it is,"some would say bruce who! when it comes to music. But those people that have heard any of his music know what to expect. this is some of his older stuff from the 80's. At times it shows it's age but is still great. Any die hard Willis fans will love it. My fave is jackpot, a fine tune to get go going in the morning. Buy, listen and enjoy."
4,Inspirational,"Music of the Light really brings the soul to its rightful place. As I listen to the songs one by one I was moved spiritually. Lynn has a beautiful soothing voice that let's her emotions really come forth in this wonderful collection of songs. The innocence and honesty of the lyrics combined with her voice are what really lash out. The title release really took me by surprise with it's latin beats and happy souds, I really found myself smiling and dancing. If you want to listen to a real person singing about what they really believe in, this is the CD for you. I highly recomend it! Wendy Andino (Who Do You Say I Am?) music ministry and band waguitar@yahoo.com"
1,I expect that!!,"They wrote it glows up to 8 hours after being exposed to light!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT!? actually it glows for 15 minutes only after being in a direct strong light for 3 hours!! this toy is insane for children. however, I bought this to use it for something no more than 2 hours then I'd throw it but it's really useless. And BTW they're plastic stones and not glass, and they all glow in blue only, so the picture is better than u expect."
2,disappointed,"i was very disappointed it just seemed bigger and when i recieved it the gems were so small i couldn't see them it was a very small all around the picture was made to look alot bigger than what it was,i wanted to return it but i could not find the paper work and i did read all the info on it but was still surprised at the size of it. and now i am stuck with it,and i won't even give it as a gift to no one sorry but thats how i feel"
3,Just OK,"Don't look as nice in person. But they were very inexpensive, so you can buy several sets. They picked odd poems to use on them too."
4,bookmarks,"I like this set very much. As a matter of fact, I have purchased several sets. The pictures are lovely and the quotes from her poems fun to read again and again."
5,loved these bookmarks,I thought they were cute and very cheap they are printed on thick paper and a great value
4,Beautiful markers,"Honestly, I just purchased these to get my total to the 25.00 minimum for free s/h but I'm glad I did. As a long-time fan of Emily, I really appreciate the artwork and the careful selection of poems that are included. Even my four year old loves them and studies each picture and asks to have the poems read to him. I plan to purchase more of these as gifts for friends and bibliophiles like myself."
3,top edges stained with dark liquid...Images appealing,"Images are clear reproductions from a vintage source, very quaint and appealing. BUT Top inside edge of all pages stained with dark liquid...Coffee?...Machine oil? The item is too inexpensive to do returns, this review is the only place I could find to complain."
3,A good resource for layer 2 and 3,"This book is very rich in information on layer 2 and 3 in respects to bridging and routing. It provides a solid foundation on which to build. Perlman includes a lot of information on OSI, which was important at the time it was written, however it is semi useless unless you are working in this type of environment. She also makes personal comments throughout the text which in almost all cases are completely unnecessary. However, aside from the extra information and comments, there is still a good set of useful information."
4,A fine book on Layer 2 and Layer 3 issues.,"A classic work that details importanct aspects of Bridging and Routing in data networks. Although covering particular current technologies, this book gives a thorough treatment of the issues behind vendor offerings. Readers will gain an understanding of what Bridging (Layer 2) and Routing (Layer 3) functionality can and can't do for their networks. Layer 2 functionality is currently being sold as ""switching"" rather than ""bridging"", but the issues are the same. This book was recommended to me and I bought it. The first time I read it, I guess I understood it on a superficial level only. The next time I read it, it clarified many issues for me. I return to it from time to time, and am never disappointed with the information I find. It certainly helps cut through the current hype with switching vs routing."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"An illustrated, large sized book containing some of the key stories and elements from the 'knightly' Arthurian mythos. Gawain and the Green Knight, Tristan and Isolde, The Coming of King Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere, and The Death of Arthur.Throw in Excalibur an dthe Round Table, and you have most of it."
4,This is a good choice for the Norton user.,"I found this product easy to install. After installation a handy enable/disable icon appears on your control strip. You are allowed some customizing of operation and a log of access attempts is kept. Of course this product integrates well with other Symantec products (ie. SystemWorks). Overall if you are a home user running other Norton software this probably is the way to go. If you want a stand alone product it might be worth making a comparrison with Open Door Networks ""Door Stop""."
1,It is hard to review something when I have not received the product I paid for,I have not received 2 of the items that I ordered. It is hard to review something when you don't have and they were suppose to be Christmas presents for my Daughter.
3,okay,The book is great for creating a pattern and tailored pants. The explanations are not very clear considering there are not enough clear diagrams. Does not include instructions for creating a jacket pattern.
2,Hard to set and too expensive,"I could have bought a similar looking clock for about half what I paid for this clock, but I paid the extra money because it was a Seth Thomas and it automatically re-set itself for Daylight Savings Time. When it arrived I was really excited and went about trying to set it immediately. This clock is very hard to figure out how to set it. The directions that came with it were hard to follow. I spent about half an hour trying to figure it out and finally gave up. I ended up setting it on ""manual"" instead of ""automatic."" That way I won't have to go through any more frustration. I have assembled many products in the past, and programmed new TV's, VCR's, DVD players, etc. So I am not totally dumb.I hate to admit defeat on any product, but this clock was just too exasperating!"
3,Autoset is a bust,"This clock is OK, but the autoset is more hassle than it's worth.ANY time you want to adjust the time, you take the batteries out, set the digital clock on the back of the unit (not unlike setting an alarm clock), THEN SET THE HOUR/MINUTE HANDS to 12:00. Put the AA batteries back in, push the switch to 'run' and the clock will advance to the correct time.In theory it keeps accurate time. In reality it's so-so. I need to re-set it about every month or two once it's 4-5 minutes out, and the DST auto-set on my unit doesn't have the 2007 change so DST came early for us this year.If you always set your clock before 1pm or 1am, it's GREAT. If you set your clock at 7pm, you have to watch it run at 12x speed while it advances to the correct time. 12x is kind of slow -- going to 9pm will take a solid 45 minutes.Interesting concept. Stick with normal clocks unless you like the hassle described above."
3,Mystery lite!,"Magdalena Yoder is back with the verve and over-the-top humor which characterize this series. This time, one of the citizens of Hernia, Pennsylvania, has sold his land to a group who plan to build a winery called Grape Expectations. Of course this does not go over well in this ultra-conservative Amish community, and the outraged citizens look for ways of heading off this potential catastrophe. Someone, however, carries the anger too far when one of the developers of the winery is killed. For some obscure reason, the local sheriff decides that Magdalena is her #1 suspect. As usual, the book is full of madcap jokes, and several past indiscretions come to life which seem at odds with the supposed clean-living Mennonite and Amish citizens of Hernia. The book is mildly amusing, but the oft-used formula in this series may be wearing a little thin."
2,Too much background information,"I believe I have read all of the Pennsylvania Dutch mysteries and have been a big fan, but this one fell very flat. There was entirely too much background information included/required. If anyone had picked this up and tried to read it without having read the other mysteries first, I doubt it would have made any sense. Myers explains the whole background of each character, such as Melvin Stoltzfus, who isn't even a character in this book, but whose background is included. It's very cumbersome and difficult to follow the present story.I think there comes a time when an author needs to just let go of a character's background and let the present circumstances speak for themselves. Now's the time!!"
2,surreal (but others in the series seem better),"I found this in the mystery section at the library and figured someone with this many published books in a series must be pretty good... Then I tried to read it and wondered if this is one of those modern surreal novels where everything seems like a dream where strange people with strange names do strange things for no reason. (The description of one of the local drivers reminds me of a dream I once had, and trying to get though this book seemed like a nightmare.) There was a mystery somewhere in there because there was a denouement at the end but most of it seemed to be comedy of the absurd. (It did have recipes but they were trying to force themselves to fit the grape theme and most of them seemed as bizarre and surreal as the plot.)Fortunately I'd gotten two books from the library and the other was much more comprehensible so this particle volume seems to be an anomaly (like the author had a fever while trying to write it.)"
3,Not the best!,"I have read other book series and the characters have developed as the books went along. For some reason Magdalena hasn't. Each book you know she is going to say something about her big feet, having small breasts,and her bigamist ex husband etc. If you have read the earlier books you know about her ancestry. Why does she have to keep bringing it up over and over. I am wondering if Tamar Myers is just trying to add filler in the books because there isn't much of a story. When I got to the recipe area at the end of the book, I couldn't believe the errors I found. In the first one for Cornish Game Hens 2 ingredients were left out of the ingredients list but were mentioned in the instructions. Also the last recipe for the Concord Grape Cake called for a 10 inch tube pan but said the recipe makes 1 inch cake. It also said to cook the cake for 15 minutes on a rack instead of cool. Guess the editor was sleeping on the job."
3,Did not have info I was looking for,"Bought on line at Amazon.com Book was in very good condition, and it even had an autograph by author. Just didn't have what I was looking for. Arrived on time and undamanged."
5,"""That Electrician Must Be a Democrat""",Luther's (Don Knotts) speech at the C of C Picnic is one of the funniest moments in movie history. This movie improves greatly after you've seen it 6 or 7 times.
5,Perennial Halloween Favorite,"I love this movie. We watch it almost every year on Halloween. Sweet and funny and just the right amount of faux-scary drama. Great cast with lots of fine character actors, and classic lines. My old VHS copy has worked well for years, but I'm happy that it is now available on DVD. Pair it with Young Frankenstein for the perfect Halloween double-feature."
5,MY FAVORITE KNOTTS FILM!,"This is a perfect vehicle for Knott's nervous ""fraidy cat"" persona. Don plays a bumbling reporter that gets himself in a situation where he must stay in a supposedly haunted house over night.....need I say more? The outcome is hilarious. Vic Mizzy lends his talents as composer of the music and that unforgettable haunted organ music! My review is for the Don Knotts collection DVD set this film is included in. The transfer looks excellent. Time to watch ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet""!"
4,A Good Goofy Halloween Movie,"Don Knotts does a Barney Fife-ish performance as a mild-mannered aspiring journalist who braves a night in a haunted house to document his experience and uncovers a sinister plot dating back to a years-old local murder. Sounds serious, but it's not. Lots of gag-type physical comedy. Solid movie for what it is; I was entertained and you can watch it even with your younger kids without giving them a complex. Otis from the Andy Griffith Show has a cameo-ish role also."
5,Lots of fun for the fam,Don Knotts at his dorkiest best! A fun (and a little creepy!) movie our family enjoys watching every Halloween.
5,Great comedy movie.,Don Knotts plays Luther Heggs a bumbling nervious wanna-be reporter who takea dare to spend a night in a haunted house. In between trying to solve the mystery Luther all so tries to get the couriage to talk to the women of his dreams and ask her out.This is one of my favorite comdey movies I allways enjoy watching Don Knotts who was one of the best funny man in the business. this is a movie to be enjoyed by the entire family. I just love the orgain music when it plays that haunting melody.I highly recommened this movie.
5,One of my childhood favorites still as good as ever!,"I first saw ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"" when I was a kid on a rainy Saturday afternoon and I loved it imeediately! I have been looking all over for it on DVD locally, but only Amazon had it and it is great! It's in widescreen and looks better than on tv. Even my teenaged kids liked it and that's saying a lot in this day and age!"
4,Great laughs,Don Knots is at his best. Really a great story of bravery and mystery.I can't count the number of times I've watched this movie but everytimethere is something new to discover and laugh about. It should be a classicin the Don Knots movies.don
4,"GHOSTS IN RACHEL, KANSAS","A purposely corny but funny venture into the sixties. Don Knotts is in his element as Luther Heggs, the timid typesetter who dares to spend the night in the town's local haunted house. The old ladies who are residents of the boarding house in which Luther lives are a riot (and they used Bon Ami!) The organ music is creepy and the victrola scene is startling. It's filled with such familiar faces as Ellen Corby (Grandma Esther of the Waltons) Reta Shaw, (she says to her husband after balling him out ""Milo, you didn't eat your tapioca"") Hope Summers (Clara on Andy Griffith), Dick Sargent, (Bewitched) Nydia Westman, Jesslyn Fax and the once-great radio actress Lurene Tuttle. A key role is played by the elusive Philip Ober (he was married to Vivian Vance for 20 years.) Don Knotts has rarely been better (his scene in the sleeping bag is priceless), and Joan Staley is very nice to look at. Fun for people who are in the mood for lightweight fluff from a bygone era."
3,Great mid-60's period piece.,This is a really fun movie to see if you remember anything about the 60's. All the familiar character actors are here. Lots of adult level one-liners if you pay attention.
3,Tough Translation for young kids,"I gave this to my 8 year old daughter as a classic, charming tale. We'd had a long day before watching it, but it didn't take to long to realize that the pace of it is so much slower than what kids are used to these days. The jokes are very subtle in some cases and there is a lot of ""drama"" in between. By the time we got 1/2 way thru the court scene. Only the 8 year old and I were still awake. She seemed determined to see it in a polite way. Everyone else was asleep. It's a nice movie, but compared to some of the more recent stuff it suffers. I'll bet that it doesn't get picked again...maybe next Halloween."
4,A must-see for any Don Knotts fan!,"Don Knotts will probably not be known as one of the all-time great actors by many people, but his works greatly entertain me and for that I thank him."
5,Scary Hilarity,"You go from the edge of your seat to the edge of your sanity.And the organ music is unmatched for setting a ghostly mood.And like most, my favorite line is: ""And they used Bon Ami""."
4,Good Classic Movie,"This movie is pretty good, they always have it on during holloween time, but I think it's more of a comedy than a horror. It's really not scarry, it's a funny family classic starring Don Knotts, (Barney on Andy Griffit)."
2,movie freezing while watching,"didn't watch right away after getting the movie, when i did about half way into the show , kept freezing up , should get money back or replace it the movie with another , very disappointed !!!!!!"
5,Can't get enough of Don Knotts,"As a fan of the Andy Griffith show, Don Knotts was my favorite character. He keeps the laughs going in The Ghost and Mr. Chicken. I highly recommend this movie, especially if you are a big Don Knotts fan."
4,good family film,This movie was still as funny as I remember when I was a kid. We watched it together as a family movie night with our teen & tween and they liked it.
4,Halloween Fun,"""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"" takes the familiar story of the haunted house at the end of the neighborhood and turns it into something that is comical and timeless. The film is filled with believable characters, a cheerful small town atosmphere, and a fun Halloween feel, not unlike ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" or ""Munster, Go Home"". It is great to finally have this Don Knotts' treasure on DVD."
5,The Quick And Easy Giant Dahlia Quilt On The Sewing Machine,Very easy to follow instructions. Reusable templates in three sizes. I have used the large size to make a quilted table topper for a round table. Perfect!
3,Good resource.,"This is an older type of book...just basic information on assembly. However, the pattern is easy to understand and the pieces are in the book...so, it does the job."
3,A Less Than Satisfying Collection,"Okay, five stars for the music, but only one star for the value on this installment of the 20th Century Masters fiasco. After all, you're getting just over 34 minutes of music. By the time you purchase volumes 1 and 2, you could instead purchase 2000's Motown-The Classic Years, a two-disc, 40-song collection that includes more than half of these songs and other classics like ""The Tracks of My Tears,"" ""Reach Out I'll Be There"" and ""I Can't Get Next to You."" Motown keeps repackaging their Sixties and Seventies back catalog, and sometimes they get it right. Collections like Motown-The Classic Years hits the bull's-eye. This Millennium Collection doesn't even hit the target."
2,Music Classic Packaging Lame,this is where these Collections are Weak.Motown has so Much Great Music that one Disc can't Possible cover the Many Important Artists on the Label.You gotta start with 5 Discs to fully understand the Motown Sound.it's a Company that won't ever be matched again.The Talent over the Years on Motown alone is mind blowing a basic set like this does it a Injustice.
5,Great fun!,My little dog loves this ball. She is about eighteen pounds and destroys anything with stuffin or made out of rubber. This ball is still intact and she plays with it daily. We have had it over 2 months.
2,not so good,The ball survived my 9 month old pup for about 7 days.. then stopped working.He did love the toy but cannot withstand the torture of a 9 month old puppy.. too bad.
3,I WISH this damn thing would break!,"This ball is indestructible. The dog completely loses her mind when it's available. She drools all over it, and it stopped working briefly but once it dried out and sat for a couple weeks (locked in the closet)it started talking again. The dog just carries it around ( in a frenzy) and drops it and shoves it under the furniture. Most toys get maimed in a hurry around here, but not this obnoxious gem! I'd throw it out, but I'm trying to use it to desensitize the dog a bit."
4,"Dogs LOVE it, but people Beware!","This toy was a big hit with my Boxers and I gave one to a friend who had some pups and they loved it too! The only problem is that after hearing the silly sayings and noises made by this toy, you, the pet owner, may get very annoyed! It WILL get on your nerves after awhile! It is quite durable, and gets teeth marks, but does last. Also, the large size isn't very big (tennis ball sized) so if you have a giant breed, be carefull they don't swallow it."
1,Ball fell apart after one bite,I have bought this ball before and it lasted forever. This time I bought the ball my dog bit it once and it fell apart. Not worth the money this time.
2,Broke fast,"Stopped working after less than a month.Prior version for smaller dog worked fine after 2 years, then again after battery replacement.This one died early. Battery replacement had no effect. Suspect Quality Control issues."
2,"Confusing, Disorganized, Too Little Examples","A terrible book to learn DEs from. Just finished a course using it, they expect you to know how to solve problems with poor examples or any examples at all. This book expects you to figure everything out on your own. Also, it is useless to study from, as there are only 1 or 2 questions that actually have answers in the back of the book. It is simply cryptic, and one has to waste more time than is really neccesary to be able to figure it out. Buy another book."
1,I would not recommend this book for a science or math class,"The book doesn't provide students with a good picture of basic techniques in DE. In fact, it doesn't teach them any technique on a regular basis. I teach Numerical Methods for Differential Equations in a math class which had this book as a textbook for their DE course. Unfortunately, the lecturer followed the book too closely. Kids have a very vague understanding how to work with DE's. Any reference to this book doesn't help - a simple concept may be spread across a few chapters and eventually shall be extracted from examples."
1,"Professors all seem to love this book, but students hate it.","This is a very terrible book to learn differential equations from. Every professor I've talked to loves it. Ironically, every student I know (including myself) absloutely loaths it. I really need examples to learn something. This ""modeling"" thing just doesn't cut it."
1,This book is a liability for universities,"This book is undeniably the worst math book I have ever used. While the authors and student editors are undoubtedly more comfortable with the subject matter and are intelligent people, I found the text to be uncomprehensible by people that didn't already understand the material.If you are a student in an ODE course, I would recommend using another text. You may sleep better."
2,"Poor math text, scattered and irritating","I do not feel I learned much math from reading this book. There is no logical presentation or foundation. The problems are mostly complicated arithmetic, and one is lucky to get the right answer, let alone learn from it. I would prefer a more thorough, axiomatic approach. This is like a storm of equations thrown at you without being TAUGHT to you."
2,To Much History,This book was good and all but Mr. Webster put way to many animal stories and history than he does physic tests with your pets. There is like 15 pages of stories and 1 1/2 pages of pet physic tests. I wouldn't recommend This Book to someone who is serious about being a Pet Physic like I am.
3,Check it when you receive it,"I ordered two of this whippers, one white and the other silver, well, only one of them arrived with the gasket (the white one) so I can use only of these at a time because the whole cream whipper is useless without the gasket which makes me feel like I wasted half of my money. I also ordered a spare one, and it never arrived."
2,Most definitely not for professional use,"We just opened up an ice cream parlor six weeks ago and I purchased three Whip-Its to make real whipped cream for our sundaes. All three are out of commission. One will not seal properly, another's rubber gasket broke and we have no idea why the third won't work. Can't tell you how many chargers we've wasted, not to mention quarts of cream. I'm now trying another brand."
4,A must have tool,"This tool is very sturdy,and durable. easy to use. a must have in any mechanics tool box. makes it less time consuming to adjust your brakes."
5,"Play it early, play it often","I must say that the first time through this album, I thought I ""got it"". The second time through listening to it, I thought I was wrong the first time. Third time I was confused.Then, I finally figured this album out: it's a literal _tour de force_. The artists really go for a ride across the musical spectrum.and do so well. From the homage to pop-culture that is ""Columbo"" to the make-Major-Tom-Proud ""O, Judy Astronaut"", there's not a missed note here.Bottom line: don't try to pidgeon-hole the work. Sit down, put your best headphones on and listen."
5,Looked everywhere else,Was THRILLED to find this and to receive it at a reasonable price and in exactly as described order. Ordered as a gift and the receiver was even more thrilled!
5,I concur.........,"....with Dr. Groothius! Whilst I may not agree in total, regarding today's culture ""vacuum,"" I do agree that there is far too little brilliant musical ""art"" extant in the venues creating same today! Nonetheless, this sonically superb live recording is nothing short of genius,.. whatever the time frame. If you are a jazz aficianado and especially, if your favor Mssrs. Mingus and/or Dolphy you MUST OWN this incredible example of Audio Jazz NIRVANA!"
5,A Beautiful CD...,"Relaxing, Refreshing, Romantic... Jim Wilson Has scored a winner with ""Cape of Good Hope."" As you listen, you get a strong sense of what Jim's Music is all about. A truly gifted Artist, Jim's music touches your heart and soul. One song I would like to comment on is ""Picasso's Midnight Stroll""... The feeling I get from this song, is a bit haunting, yet a very sensuous melody. The vocal arrangement of Dan Fogelberg is almost hypnotizing. Jim Wilson has brought a vivid feeling to this song with his amazing touch of the keys. You can almost smell the rose petals..and see the candles flickering away.. The Accordion adds a special touch. Harmonious, breathtaking and sexy..5 stars for this cd? I say 10! A Wonderful work of art... Good Luck Jim.."
4,"Not an Uncommon sound, but a delightful listen.","I have to be honest in reviewing this cd.....I bought it to hear Dan Fogelberg's contribution to it.I am firstly a Dan Fogelberg fan, if he hums a song....I want it.Which is close to what he does for ""Picasso's Midnight Stroll"".""Picasso's......is a dreamy mysterious song.Dan lends a very haunting wordless vocal, along with a beautiful female harmony......like two lovers wading through a placid park.Jim Wilson has once again chosen his accompanying musicians well.Buy this Cd for its simple quality.It is relaxing and it is soothing.But don't fall asleep to it.....you may miss its gift.Each song is a deep breath and sigh.I recommend also ""Northern Seascape"".These two sorta go hand in hand!"
1,I Should Have Known Better,"So far, I have been unimpressed with this book. I am interested in the subjects, but don't care for the author's rather bland writing style."
4,Not made it USA,This is the first OTC tool that I own not made in the USA. This product is made in Taiwan. From now on I will check OTC to see where it is made at before I purchase.
3,Have not used it yet,"I am an Automotive Technology student at a local college. I bought this for shop use but have not used it yet. What I did notice is, the list of vehicles that it fits does not include Volkswagen. But, for the price I will purchase a separate one for VW's if needed. I was going to buy a different one until I saw it was made in Taiwan. I believe in buy American. I have a few OTC tools and I am happy with them."
2,Marginal Quality,"I purchased 8 of the AA batteries because of the low price of 4.99 for 4.The fine print on the battery indicates 1900 milliamps plus or minus 10 percent, so the range would be 1710 to 2090 milliamps. After many days of ""refreshing"" the battery in my La Crosse BC-900 charger I ended up with the following:1634 Milli amps1795170120011769178117541549So two of the cells are below spec.Earlier I had purchase some 2700 milliamp batteries from Sanyo, on Amazon, for about 12.99 per four. All of them were within spec.I'm glad I didn't pay a penny more than 4.99 for four."
1,No Good from the Beginning,"I bought some of these with the recharger, and one of the batteries was bad almost immediately. It would not take a charge, and I was getting ""null"" on the display. Soon after 2 more died.These are the worse rechargable batteries I've ever used. Save your money1 buck per pack would be too much."
2,Leaky Batteries,"Of 12 batteries I purchased, 2 of them were leaking in the box. I would rate these higher except that I also purchased 20 AAAs and 12 of them were leaky. I imagine I was just lucky that only 2 of this size leaked. Take the fact that most of these batteries will be bad when you compare prices. I paid $4.99/4-pack which is a good price as long as more than half of them survive (whick may not be very likely)."
1,Batteries,"After charging the batteries, 1 of the 2000 mah batteries only had a capacity of 400 mah. This means the whole 4-pack is no good."
4,Arch-Bishop Sheen at his finest,While conveniently sized and traditionally arranged this pocket sized book is super for those who wish to practice the Stations with quiet personal reflections as only Arch Bishop Sheen can evoke. While the size is perfect to fit in a shirt pocket and allow one to follow the stations before/after mass the only reason I limit the selection to 4 stars is because I would so much like if the book contained more of Arch Bishop Sheen's reflections. He is truly an inspired Catholic communicator!
3,"Looks good, but parts are inexpensive plastic","I wanted a smaller KitchenAid processor for small everyday jobs. I have a heavy duty one for the larger jobs which I am very happy with. The KFP715ER is cheaply made. Just after 7 months the bowl parts gave way. I will attempt to return for a new bowl since I have had it under a year. I do expect more from KitchenAid as I have had other processors, refrigerator and wine refrigerator that I have been very satisfied with. My advice to KitchenAid is don't make a product that has inexpensive parts. Better not to make it at all. Will now see how they back their product."
1,Kitchen 7-cup food processor,"Very disappointed with this blender's performance!!!!! It has limited speed adjustments, which limits your control over the outcome of processing food. This machine Pulverizes food that you only want to chop. Unless making puree- type foods, this is not the processor for you."
1,flimsy bowl,This food processor has a flimsy bowl. After the first bowl broke (the red outside part of the handle comes undone)I purchased a second bowl for $25. This bowl is now on the verge of breaking. As soon as this handle breaks I'm tossing this food processor. Not a quality product.
2,It broke after a week,"The holder broke after a week. It has 6 sections to hold the lids, I could not use all 6 at once. So... what am I going to do with it now?"
1,Pot lid holder,"This product really has not been helpful. It does not hold our pot lids properly hanging from our pot rack. It would be much better if it had a stretcher across the bottom for each lid to lean against. Our lids fall forward too much while hanging. I would actually give it no stars, since I haven't been able to use it."
2,Works,I was slightly disappointed that this does not come molded with any way to attach it to a surface (such as pre drilled holes)
1,"It would be a handy solution, but...","I did not have time to take a picture. My medium and large lids were fighting for a space and unfortunately neither won. They fell twice right after I secured the rack on the wall. Then I had to redo it because the rack would not stay in place.I wanted rack like this for a long time, but I could not find it in any store. Stores like BB& Beyond had ones that standing. The problem is I have really small kitchen and not enough shelf space. But this rack looked like it was a school project- not finished. It should have been longer to have space for big lids: that why people buy that staff in the first place and with special places for screws. I packed it back into the box only a half an hour later after opening it."
2,not a useable organizer,"Another flop in organizer products. The metal coated ribs that are supposed to hold the lids are very flimsy. One bottom ribs just bent over & the entire item is not usable. Even if it had not been broken, your shelves would need to be set way back to allow for door to close when lids are stored in it."
4,Holds most lids well,"The pot lid holder holds all of my lids well except for my largest one, a Calphalon 12"" glass lid. If place on the bottom slot, it eventually starts falling backwards until it crashes into the ground. The holders are just too short for the lid.The solution is to place the 12"" lid on the second to the bottom slot and a smaller 10"" lid on the bottom slot. The smaller lid is secured in its slot and ends up holding the larger lid in place as it falls onto the lid instead of the ground."
4,Handy pot lid holder,Wish I had this years ago! It holds my pot lids neatly and I can get them when I need them. It rally does not take much room either . It was easy to attach to the wall. My pot lids are pretty heavy but the holder is sturdy enough for them
3,"Works ok, could be better","Upfront, the package came with only 2 mounting pieces, which seems inadequate given the three points on the product. Without a third, the holder would wobble from side to side when one was placed at the top and the other in the middle of the bottom. We ended up using a screw with a large head to secure the top while using the pieces included for the bottom. To date (about a month), the thing hasn't come down and holds 3-5 lids at a time (probably about 5 lbs or so). It does have some space issues so depending on your lids it may not be able to fit as many."
1,Unusable,"At first I thought these would work great, but two things have me buying alternatives right away: (1) I tried to adjust the arms slightly and one immediately broke off. Oops. (2) The arms are too weak to hold larger, heavier lids. They bend forward and the lids slide out. Waste of money."
2,There's a reason why they only show one lid in it on the picture...,"Received product, and it looked nice, seemed sturdy. Then I started playing with it...I could literally fit three lids on the thing. And I have glass lids...they do have large knobs, which was the problem. Nothing would fix it. But I figured, hey, cheap enough, at least some of my lids are out of the way. Then I took a closer look...and the bottom ""rung"" on one side wasn't there. No, not broken off...just plain missing. Talk about poor quality control...returned it. Thank goodness Amazon has a great return policy"
4,Just like described,Well balanced and fits well on the inside of my cabinet door. The holder is exactly as described in the listing.
1,Doesn't hold the lids,It could only hold 3 lids at a time and even with so many empty spaces all of the lids would fall off when trying to get just the one needed.
2,not what I needed,It does not hold my glass tops. It does not fit on my inside cabinet door. There was no hardware included
1,don't waste your time,"this is the worst book of saints I've ever read (& as a Catholic ""boomer"" I've read quite a few).At first glance it has an orthodox look (mostly due to the tradional, pious art) but it's deceptive. There's a snarky put-down on every page. Ha ha, so funny- not! Ugh. This book is categorized ""reference/humor,"" but was marketed in the religion section of a big-box secular bookstore. It should have been filed away in the Humor section as it is nothing but a joke.... an unfunny one at that."
4,Great Actors at their best,This is a good vdvd that have all the great old actors. If you like old movies you will like this. I love Fred MacMurray whoever releases movies (United Artist I think)on dvd please release his two movies Suddenly It's Spring and The Bride Comes Home these are two of his best work. Somebody please put them out on dvd.
1,Lame,"This is one of the worst movies ever made. A jumble of stars, at least three directors, comedy so lame that it only cause groans (when not snores). Henry Fonda and James Stewart making fools of themselves. Harry James ogling a starlet who was supposed to be playing the trumpet. A dreadful experience, best avoided."
5,as promised,the product was delivered promised and seems to be exactly what I thought it was. Haven't had the need to use it yet - hopefully never will.
5,"Works great on its own, or attached to life ring","We use these on our boats, and have found them to be very easy to use and reliable. If you want to use this to replace the standard coil of floating line on a life ring, you simple clip the bag onto the life ring, and secure the bitter end to the boat. You just throw the ring, and the line pays out from the bag. Great product, and don't let the low price fool you.. its as good as any other."
5,I have not found a need for it yet (Thank God)...,"Folks,Well.... Being that its use appears to be that if some one falls overboard... you throw it to them?I hope that I never have a need for it. The Coast Guard appreciates seeing it hanging some were in plane site on your boat.If they're happy... I'm happy. Hence, Five (5) stars.Rascal"
3,"OK, but not as good as Julie Fanselow's book","I travelled the entired L&C trail 2 years ago and used an earlier edition of this book and an earlier edition of Julie Fanselow's guide book to the trail. Fifer's book has beautiful maps, but in all other ways, I felt that Fanselow's guide book was much better. The Fifer book was lacking a lot of information on sites, hotels, and campsites that the Fanselow book had. Also- my copy of the Fifer book started to fall apart after a few days on the road- the binding wasn't very secure- this makes big difference when you're referring to a book every day for several weeks! Additionally, the Fifer book had a lot of ads and the Fanselow book didn't. Some of these problems might have been corrected in the new edition, of course. I'm glad I had the Fifer book on the trail- the maps were helpful at times. But if someone is looking to purchase just one book to travel the L&C trail, Fanselow's book is definitely superior."
3,Does Not Fit TDI,"According to the 'is this compatible' section of Amazon.com, this is compatible with a 2011 Jetta TDI (Diesel). This is not the case. The correct part number is 33-2865 (hey, it's cheaper, can't complain). If you have a TDI, make sure to order the correct part number. This can be confirmed on the KNFilters.com website."
3,It has cute packaging...and that's about it...,"I bought this product direct through the Completely Bare website, and it's an okay product. All it is, is a $32 jar of acne pads. So I would recommend just going to walmart or some drug store and buying some acne pads for sensitive skin. The only reason to buy this product is if you REALLY love the packaging, because that's all that your paying for. It even says on the packaging that the product is for the treatment of acne. Buy it somewhere else for a heck of a lot less money."
4,Great Projector,Great Projector. But don't buy it here. List is $1299 and SONY style gave a $100 discount!
4,"Excelente, Gran calidad","Me funciona de Maravilla, lo utilizo como televisor a diario y me trabaja muy bien, de verdad que lo recomiendo.No le doy 5 estrellas porque le falta solamente que se pudiese ver con la luz encendida de mi cuarto, pero cuando apago la luz se ve espectacular."
3,Decent look at black teen mothers,"I read this years ago, but I remember it being okay. The author observes black teen mothers and their struggles and puts a human face on conservatives' favorite scapegoat. In our days of ""Maury Povich"" where baby daddy and baby grandmas call these young girls ""sluts"" in front of all America, the author notes that many grandmothers force their sons to accept paternity as soon as they see how much the new babies look like the fathers did when they were younger. The author's style is observational and may not be methodologically-sound for many. And sometimes, the conversation does get too internal. Still, I wish the author a good academic career and I thank her for increasing the scholarship on black women, particularly young and poor ones."
5,Romans,"This book is the second in a series of sermons by Ray Stedman of Peninsula Bible Church Palo Alto CA. the first in the series covered Romans 1-8, this book is Romans 9 to the end. Each chapter is one Sunday's sermon, going verse by verse, pulling out history, and modern personal application. Ray Stedman's ability to bring clarity and usefullness from Scripture was his main quality. He brought his scholarship, insight, and life experiences to bear. Good Read."
2,This is not what I thought I ordered.,"I was hoping that I was getting the I Got 5 On It extended remix. I can't to find it anywhere. I want this song bad. Besides all that, I Got 5 On It is one of the best songs of the 90's. It's just too sweeeet!"
3,Track Listing,Track Listing1 I Got 5 On It (Clean Short Mix) (3:59)2 I Got 5 On It (Clean Bay Ballas Vocal Remix) (4:12)3 I Got 5 On It (Gumbo Funk Remix) (4:50)4 I Got 5 On It (Clean Weedless Mix) (4:12)
5,i love lancome and i trust her at all.,i have been worked for lancome for a period.i love lancome since i knew her because i was confident of the product and proud to be lancome employee when i knew her history.
2,"Beautiful prose, but.....","Too drawn out for my taste. Plus, the connections among the characters seemed tenuous. However, if literary is what one likes, one will be pleased with this selection. The author does have that particular way with his words. And I mean that with respect."
1,Dreadful and one-dimensional,"I can't believe I wasted so much time... The description of OM Shinrikyo was accurate, as were his descriptions of Japan, Okinawa, and England. The rest of the book was fuzzy, unconvincing, and characters seemed like cardboard cutouts. The conclusion was frankly retarded. The book limps along like a lame dog. When I finally read the last page, it was as if someone mercifully put a bullet in the dog's head. Although Mitchell's prose is lyrical, his storytelling and research could use quite a bit of work."
1,"Trying to be ""edgy,"" this book is simply offensive","I am by no means a vehement critic of all things David Mitchell--on the contrary, I would count his ""Cloud Atlas"" as among the best books I have ever read. However, the two books I have read from his beginner days--Ghostwritten and Number 9 Dream--are simply trashy.Both these books, in their quest to be edgy and postmodern, just throw gobs of offensive imagery at the reader. There are extensive references to cheap sex, illegal drug use, and extreme violence. It's a tactic that makes these books glean good reviews on account of the fact they ""take risks"" or ""push the envelope."" Don't be fooled by it!Reading ""Ghostwritten"" or ""Number 9 Dream,"" in my opinion, is little better than watching an episode of ""CSI"" or ""The Sopranos"" on television. In other words, this book isn't literature--it's cheap pulp."
3,Ends in a blur,"I have just come to Mr. Mitchell after reading the article on him recently in Time and the generally very enthusiastic Amazon reviews, I decided to start with Ghostwritten, his first book, and to take it from there. I was very engaged and read it voraciously, thoroughly enjoying the concept, his terrific style, imagination and inventiveness until the highly anticipated last two sections when suddenly confusion set in and, for me, coherence stopped - a feeling of ""what?"". When I finished, I could not help but feeling let-down and puzzled. In modern fiction, one doesn't expect all to be tied-up neatly at a dénouement, but the ending of Ghostwritten was quite perplexing and ungratifying. After a lull, I will certainly continue with more of his work and hope for a bit more satisfaction."
3,A book that defies labels...,"I just closed this book moments ago, and am still not exactly sure how I feel about the ending. I loved the idea of this book, its complexities, its varied voices, the scope of its locations. I loved that the author used distinctly different voices to tell each narrative. I loved how these characters briefly overlapped into each others' stories. Very clever and well thought out, especially for a first time writer. The non-human's story, though, kind of lost me a bit, as did the last 50 pages or so. I felt like it was written in an esoteric language that I didn't quite understand. I wish that the author hadn't taken this turn when he did, because I was on the verge of giving this book 5 stars. By making this story too complex, perhaps, he lost me. At the risk of sounding unintelligent, it just went over my head."
4,Deus Ex Machina?,"Each of the segments in this amazing book drew me in and absorbed me with its believability, richness of description and distinctive perspective. My only complaint was that I didn't feel that the farcical ending fit the rest of the book. It reminded me a bit of the way the novel Huck Finn builds a real relationship between Huck-the-white-boy and Jim-the-slave only to have the ending of the story twisted out of recognition with the arrival of Tom Sawyer and his antics. I would like to read more of Mitchell to see if he outgrew this ""everything ties up at the end by means of something almost irrelevant to what has gone before..."""
5,"Rich story, over too soon","Mitchell's pre-CLOUD ATLAS attempt at a fluid, interlocking story is a little too fast in parts, a little laggy in others, but a much more exciting read than ATLAS. GHOSTWRITTEN's atmosphere is tense and exciting, and Mitchell shows off a well-honed set of storytelling skills, including fake-outs and some horrific surprises, as he proceeds around the world and through time, connecting people's lives and stories to one another. It's hard to say how the story will progress next - if this is your first time reading this book, enjoy this magic that Mitchell uses so well. Subsequent reads for me were not quite as gripping as the first time through - I don't want to say that this style is a one-trick pony for Mitchell, but my excitement for this book dwindled the second time around. In spite of that, Mitchell tells a really wonderful story - better than just writing a good book."
2,Confusing and more than slightly odd.,"This book is certainly interesting, however by the conclusion I was puzzled and I felt really let down. The book deals with many different characters leading extremely different lives, and throughout the novel one is just waiting to see how the author is going to pull all the threads together. I have to admit to being totally unimpressed with the method Mitchell used to do this. There was no build up to this unexpected and frankly unwelcome conclusion. I say unwelcome as it added absolutely NOTHING to the novel, if anything I felt it subtracted from its worth. However, saying that the book is very well written and some of the characters are beautifully portrayed. One certainly gets a whistle stop tour of the world while reading this book!"
3,Reads More Like a Short Story Collection . . .,"I thoroughly enjoyed some chapters, while I struggled through others. I'd strongly recommend only half the book. It's worth reading for these segments -- Japan, London, and Hong Kong especially. These all had interesting, ""haunted"" characters and the shared thread was mysterious and compelling."
3,Mitchell improved as he wrote more,"Having loved Thousand Autumns and been challenged by Cloud Atlas, I find this earlier work impossibly contrived. Maybe it was a great excuse for the author to travel across the world, but if I want atravelbook I will buy one. This one positively oozes Local Colour. That analysis of the London Tube -ugh!"
3,Definately not my favorite David Mitchell novel,I desperately wanted to like this book because I loved Cloud Atlas so much! One characteristic that has been mentioned regarding David Mitchell is that he very quietly weaves stories and you as the reader are more compelled to come to moral conclusions without the annoyance of having them shoved down your throat. Maybe he was a little TOO quiet in weaving his message in this one. I finished the book just kind of grasping desperately for a meaning - without success. Its possible it was just over my head. The stories just seemed a little too inconsequential and there needed to be more of a tie in or conclusion. To me.
4,"One Novel, Nine Wonderful Read","This is not exactly one whole novel by itself, it is more like a book containing nine short stories, each with its own character, theme, setting, and style. The concept of the book reminds me of the novel, Magnolia, where although each segment is a story by itself, the characters and their stories are somehow linked to one another.This is an enjoyable book. The book brings us around the globe, giving us wonderful insights to different cities and cultures. It introduces us to a variety of interesting characters, from the young, middle-aged, old and even spirits."
5,tarantino meets calvino,"Fans of postmodern literature will recognize hints of Italo Calvino's ""If on a Winter's Night a Traveler."" The action lurches from one story to the next, connected only in tangential ways. What is an unimportant detail in one story is the highlight of another story. Mitchell uses this structure to elaborate on themes of chance and coincidence.Another comparison (slightly strained maybe) would be to Tarantino's film Pulp Fiction, with its careening plot-line, snappy dialogue, and multi-dimensional characters. As in that movie, the vignettes in Ghostwritten are really engaging as short works of their own.The strange structure of the book would be really grating without good writing, and it's a testament to Mitchell's abilities as a young writer that he was able to pull this off so successfully."
1,...and I'm still waiting to figure out what's so good.,"David Mitchell, Ghostwritten (Random House, 1999)Ghostwritten was one of the first books to hit my Amazon wish list back when I first set it up four years ago. I have no idea what inspired me to put it there, but having now finally read the thing, the question has gone from ""why did I do this?"" to ""what on earth was I thinking?""The story revolves (very slowly) around nine different characters whose lives interconnect. And while the characters themselves are interesting, Mitchell's portrayal of them doesn't do them justice. I'm not sure how one takes a member of a cult (based obviously on Falun Gong) on the verge of collapse and makes him boring, but it happens here. By the time you've meandered through forty uninteresting pages on the fourth or fifth of these characters, you'll have stopped caring in the least about how these connections are going to get more tenuous. (zero)"
4,"Math Error, Ugh!","The lovely writing and connecting of stories aside, I couldn't help but feel icked out by the major math error on pg. 205:""I count the seconds. Forty minutes times sixty seconds, that's twenty-four thousand seconds to go.""40 x 60 = 2400, not 24,000."
4,An Excellent Book on Community and Relationships,"I purchased this book (among many on here) for my unit on whales and the Inuit (Eskimo) people for my first grade class. This was a great book to share the relationship the people have with whales. It also shared a wonderful way the communities work together as well. What a great book! If you like whales, this is a great one to read to children!"
4,A Fairly Good Overview,"I noticed this book and couldn't resist purchasing it. It is refreshing to have a resource dedicated solely to literacy at this grade level. It provided more of an overview of the literacy elements rather than an in-depth look. This was useful in some ways. It helped reassure me that I was on track in many areas, while inspiring me to reconsider other parts of my literacy program. There were, however, many parts of the book that I felt could have been fleshed out in more detail. For example, the book refered to Book Clubs and cited a resource readers could turn to for more information. But, since the book is written for new fifth grade teachers, it seems it would be useful to give more information about this area (and others). Overall, I found the book useful and even reproduced several of the journal activities to use with my students. I hope the authors consider expanding it for further editions."
4,Great Movie. A nice revisit with the soundtrack,"Great condition.. Some things you just can't get on MP3 download, or it's more affordable to shop around. Thanks!"
2,so so set,"i ordered this set after having a bad experience with 2 other sets from a different vendor which were delivered with bent cases.This time the case wasn't bent but:1. the chips' color integrity is not great, a lot of them look scraped, or have some discoloration2. the cards were ruined after the first use in both pack (some of them started to peel)3. Dealer button is low qualitythe good thing about this case is the feel of the chips - they are heavy and make a nice sound - so that's good"
1,The chips don't fit,"The tray inside the case is the wrong size for these chips. The fit is too snug horizontally and too loose vertically. In other words, the racks of chips knock into each other while sitting in the case, or they fall over. So, either the chips are too big, or the case is too small. Either way, the chips will likely get damaged when they travel, and it is really difficult to get the chips in and out of the case. Very disappointing since these are really good chips and the case is really nice otherwise. Unfortunately, I will be returning this item."
1,Poor Quality,"I ordered these chips (new)through Amazon. 10-20% of the chips were scratched, scuffed, or miscolored. I returned the set for a replacement set. The second set of chips had the same problem. I rarely return products, let alone twice, but the product was not good. I would suggest finding a different set of chips."
2,"Cheap case, arrived damaged","Ordered as a gift, arrived in a flimsy box between 2 small sheets of styrofoam. There was an enormous dent in the outside of the case and it looked like the plastic strips along the case were already coming off.. case is complete trash. inside the case is some cheap foam that will probably come apart after minimal use... I didnt even bother looking at the chips, returned immediately"
4,good but not perfect,"was worried the case would be damaged in shipping after reading some reviews but was relieved that the case arrived intact and without dents or dings. Even though the latches have locks, there were no keys, but that doesn't matter since I don't plan to lock it. I would recommend this set. Not the most professional set but good enough for poker night with friends and you can't beat the price."
1,Poor service. Numerous emails - no reply!,I received two of these sets as presents (based on my request). The set is excellent EXCEPT that the white chips are thicker than the rest. A stack of 25 white chips is over a half a chip higher than a 25 chip stack of any other color. If you play poker you know this is big problem.My first two emails received assurances that they would make it right and they asked for additional details. After that all emails have gone unanswered.I was very surprised by this very poor customer service. The reviews I had read led me to believe this was a responsive and reputable company. Maybe things have changed at Chips and Games. Buyer beware.
4,Amazon scores for birthday gift,This was a gift for my son-in-law's birthday. He was really happy to get it. He had to open everything up immediately so he could feel the chips and hear how they sounded when they were tossed out on the table. He was a happy camper. The only thing he said later was one more color of chips would have made it perfect.JJ
5,Just as hoped for and expected,"I was looking for poker chips that had a lot of whites and reds (usually lower denomination) for our lower ante poker games. The set included 150 white and 100 red which was perfect for us. The chips are all clay have have a good feel, a little dusty but that's fine. The case was good quality and slightly better than I expected. I also did a little shopping for replacement chips in case some become broken and I found that there are exact replacements and reasonably priced. Overall I've very happy and comfortable recommending the set to others."
3,"Decent, though buy your own card decks","Nice solid case....chips good, not as heavy as i thought. decks of cards are worthless. cards started peeling at corners during first game. all in all generally worth it."
1,Shallow and superficial -- don't waste your money!,"I can't believe there aren't better books on this subject out there. The chapter on each person is so short and superficial that it really doesn't tell you anything. Some of these people WEREN'T EVEN FIRED, so they don't even belong in the book. Others were fired, but the author doesn't tell you why. The section on Bernadine Healy of the Red Cross is particularly sloppy and confusing. She resigned one month after 9/11 and there is no explanation at all of WHY she did. And another thing that annoyed me -- purely stylistic -- is the fact that all the interviewees keep repeating the author's name again and again (""You know, Harvey..."" ""You're right, Harvey...""). At least, ""Harvey"" quotes them as having said that."
1,Another Celebrity Worship Book,"This book is dull, dull, dull. If you like reading about celebrities, you might, might enjoy reading this. Otherwise, you will wonder why this book ever got published. I don't think it comes even close to accomplishing what the author may have intended, namely that if well-known people can get fired and rebound, then so can the reader. In fact, those portrayed in the book have had such presumably astounding success since they were fired that it almost makes you HOPE you get fired, the sooner the better, so you can get on the fast track to wealth and fame.If you get fired, this book won't help you get hired again. It really doesn't matter what these people in the book did with their lives after they were dissed by someone along the way. If you find yourself getting fired, you still have to do what you have to do to get on with your life. You can't live someone else's. And you definitely don't need a book to tell you that."
1,Ordinary,This book was purchased as the result of an over-hyped online promotion and it was a big disappointment. You can easily spend your money better.
5,"Rivals, why is it not made for Region 1 Players?","I saw the movie Rivals on LMN. Because I deemed it a very good movie I decided to buy a copy. My first stop was Amazon; unfortunately it's only sold for Region 2 players.I also checked other DVD/CD sites, and Lifetime/LMN but no luck there either.Will Rivals ever be made as a Region 1 DVD? It's an excellent movie. Thanks, Toni"
4,Pure Angie,"I bought this CD based on my love for The American & The One With The Sun. I'm not disappointed. Quite melodic, jazzy/bluesy ... I loved Shine On and Child You're the Revolution (reminds me of Pink Floyd's The Wall with the children's chorus). There is also a great bonus track that is not listed on the case. If you can find this CD (I think I just bought the last one)... BUY IT!"
2,Eh....,"I didn't realize how old this game was before I bought it.To me, the controls are choppy and the gameplay isn't all that smooth. That's all I'll say about this one."
2,Disappointing,"Although this book is advertised as a ""paperback,"" the word ""pamphlet"" would be better. It looks like someone's self-published book of poetry -- it's barely 20 pages long and can be read in about 15 minutes. It's not a bad story line, but, unless you are very familiar with some of de Lint's earlier works, this is going to be confusing. The whole story would fit a lot better into an anthology of fiction. The illustrations are somewhat scary and didn't really fit the story that well. I frankly felt that this ""book"" did not live up to de Lint's normal standard."
3,Buffalo Man -- a small taste of De Lint,Charles De Lint is my favorite author so I try to read all of his books that I can find. I ordered this one and was disappointed in how short it was. The story was only 32 pages which is really just a small taste of the banquet I'm accustomed to getting in a De Lint book. The Buffalo Man is an engaging little story that brings us back to some characters we've met in other De Lint fantasy. The Crow Girls are among these characters and act in their typical mischievous and mystifying way. I always welcome the opportunity to visit with De Lint's characters but was disappointed that this visit was so brief.
4,Country Dylan,"An often overlooked album in the Dylan library, ""Nashville Skyline"" is a near gem. This is one of few times you hear the nasally version of Dylan's voice. That voice works well with the style of country music he is playing.A duet with Johnny Cash in the remake of ""Girl From the North Country"" sets the mood for the album. It quickly transitions into the very upbeat ""Nashville Skyline Rag.""This album contains classics such as ""Lay Lady Lay"" and the tranquil ""Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You.""A must for big Dylan fans. The casual fan may find this album to be a little too ""countryish,"" but might still enjoy it."
5,Throw my troubles out the door,"Is it really any wonderThe love that a stranger might receive.You cast your spell and I went under,I find it so difficult to leave."
4,A brief Dylan Country album with a couple of his hits,"Bob Dylan/ Nashville Skyline: In the late sixties there were several country rock groups that released straight Country albums (The Byrds' Sweet Hearts of the Rodeo album comes to mind) and Dylan (who always loved Country Music) had already put out his John Wesley Harding album and now releases his Nashville Skyline album. The album is correctly titled, as the album is so short that all we get is a glimpse of that skyline. The songs are good but very short. The duet with Johnny Cash is a bit painful (as these two giants never seemed to be able to sing together well) but we also have the great ""Lay Lady Lay"" and ""Tonight I'll be staying here with you"" tracks. This is a very enjoyable album but it falls short of getting a five star rating. Nevertheless, I would not part with my copy of this album."
1,huh?,"When I put this album in, the first thing i thought was..huh?? It has to be the most bizarre dylan album i've heard to date. I don't know what is with his voice; it sounds like he has a terrible head cold. even the style and energy he sings with is strange. it doesn't sound like dylan at all. the songs are totally not his style either. It almost seems like dylan was trying to put on an alter ego thing. It does not work for him and just seems fake. The whole album seems to have a falseness about it and the strange voice is difficult to listen to. i don't know why so many people like this album, when so many dylan albums are so much better. I exchanged it for Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits.ps if you want to hear a version of ""Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You"" from this album, which totally kicks the original's little butt, get ""Live 1975-The Rolling Thunder Revue""."
4,Nashville Skyline,Pure nostalgia for me. It was a different time that was changing too rapidly. The duet with Johnny Cash is especially memorable.
2,Pretty average,Did not like the nashville sound be a great truckers CD or some one that likes nashville sound But I don't like it this is a personal thing.
5,On my short list for a desert island.,"I love this album! I used to listen to it years ago and rediscovered it recently -- it just holds up incredibly well. The artistry is consistent and of very high quality, and Dylan's voice is atypically rich and melodic. The range of tunes is perfect: from the heartbreakingly beautiful ""Lay Lady Lay"" (I'm a sucker for pedal steel), the bittersweet ""I Threw It all Away"" and the lovely ""Girl From the North country"" sung with Johnny Cash, to the sunny, uptempo ""Peggy Day,"" the tongue-in-cheek ""Country Pie,"" and the sexy and mellow ""Tonight I'll be Staying Here with You."" The whole CD is totally uplifting -- Thanks, Bob!"
5,Classic Follow Through,"The Lance Berkman figure is excellent for anyone who admires the follow through swing of a Professional Baseball player even if you are not a fan of the Houston Astros. Berkman is exhibiting a pose seconds after he has made contact with the ball and is pulling his hands and bat clear of the hitting zone while intently watching the ball's flight. In this instance the ball appears to be heading to right-center field due to the ballplayers gaze. A feature of all Mcfarlane figures are the attention to detail and the Berkman figure is no exception as it shows the muscles working in his arms and the dusting of dirt on both knees and posterior. A fine piece, underated in my view but well worth five stars!"
3,Not for a beginner,I know some Egyptian Arabic so the book is somewhat useful for me but the dialog that is written in the book is strange and does not use proper Arabic writing so it is hard to make out how things are said.The CD that comes with the book does nothing but repeat the words said throughout the book.This is more of a phrase book than a Book that would teach one how to speak Egyptian Arabic
1,Not worth your money!,"I[...] for only $ 5.00 on clearance, and even with paying only a few bucks for it, I was very disappointed when I saw it for the first time.My daughter was happy though...but everything with the disney princesses is fun for her.So if you listen to me, spend your money on another princess toy!"
5,repetitive but good,This book did a great job providing a brief early history of the car and illustrating the problems with them. The chapter on how to do without your car was informative and well researched but very repetitive.
2,?Grommet misplaced?,"The towel is nice, but the grommet is through several layers, so it is not possible to fully open this towel. I washed it, and it washed fine; I embroidered and it is was just OK. Towel seems a bit flimsy.I would not recommend this as is."

1,This was a mistake,must a clicked a wrong button came in the mail did not want it oh well cant win them all
4,The more you listen the more you want,"I bought the Kent CD a while back and at first listen found it to be quite interesting, but not the mainstream alternative sound. . The more I got into it the more I discovered how great the whole album really is with talented musicians, good songwriting and various blends with string instruments included. Very unique and I recommend this to all."
2,Not nearly as good I expected.,"Doug makes up for his lack of comic timing by saying volgar things. Sometimes the volgarity is funny, most of the time it isn't. I suggest looking elsewhere for your laughs."
5,Super!,"This young man has a superb operatic voice, and it really shines here compared to the other two CDs available at amazon at this time.You don't need to speak or understand Spanish to appreciate Mr. Pinto's voice. You just need a good ear for music. This CD has superb vocals, arrangements, and marvelously wonderful instruments.I find no 'stinkers' on this album. All of the songs are good. Perhaps the best of them are Luna Llena (Full Moon), El Que Queda Solo (The Only Thing that Remains), and El Dominguero (the Sunday Man), but everyone's taste differs. Still, I find that all the songs on this CD mix well with Shakira's songs that appeal to a more mature audience, and also with Alejandro Sanz and some of Rosario's songs.I certainly hope amazon provides access to more of his music. As he matures, he will just get better. Buy this CD, and keep your eye out for new releases.Abel Pintos is from Argentina."
3,"Good idea, but very small","I purchased this as a gift for my niece. I didn't realize, however, that this is a VERY small puzzle which limits the age range you could use it for. Just a heads up if you are purching this!"
1,Gary Lightbody's thought process...,"""How can I make my average/dull sub-Lou Barlow songs sell more copies? Hmmm... I know- I'll get a load of my famous Glasgow scenester 'friends' to play on them and then milk that 'one big happy family' gimmick for all it's worth. American college students will lap it up!""."
4,Another solid album,"Just like ""Y'all get scared now, you hear,"" ""Son of evil reindeer"" is another solid album. If you like Snow Patrol you will enjoy these two albums. More mellow than snow patrol, but a good listen just the same."
3,Goalkeeping-Practice Drills for Game Skills,"I was disappointed for the price. I feel the tape is worth only $15.00. Basic instruction for footwork, handwork & diving are clearly demonstrated, allowing you to study how the drill is performed. However, many drills are practiced by moving through cones in one direction & then reversing your direction & moving through the cones again. This entire sequence is shown at regular speed & slow motion, which is redundant. Instead other drills could have been included, such as game simulation exercises or demonstrating how to cut the angle."
4,Nice ring!,"Very nice ring for my 11 year old. Great construction. I personally don't believe that stainless steel should have cost more than $[...], but I couldn't find rings in my son's size anywhere else."
3,Skimpy and cost-ineffective,"Rhino either thinks the public has a short attention span or has money to burn, based on the evidence of this and the other ""Essentials"" titles they've been flooding the marketplace with lately. 12 tracks as opposed to 16 tracks on their regular ""Very best of"" collection at the same price? Who's idea of essential is that, the Rhino accounting department's? The music, by the way, is great. Just buy it in another collection."
3,Not as described.,"When I ordered this, I expected the traditional sock knife work in the kilt hose top. These knives typically run between 6-8 inches long and are fairly thin. This particular product is more of the scottish dirk that is meant to be worn on the belt. It is in no way a sgian dubh."
3,okay product,"i just recieved my dagger today, its nice, but i was a little dissappointed with the use of plastic on it. the molding is clean and it has good detail, but the seam had an excess of plastic ""flash"" and isa little rough. the only other complaints i have are the use of two different molded in designs on the handle, braided leather on the front and wood grain on the back. and the ""Stainless Made in China"" engraved on the back of the blade. if these things arent of any bother to you, then this is a great product. it looks nice, and the blade came really sharp! i just think that the factory look of the plastic takes away from the authenticity of the piece."
2,"Cheap replica, ok for a letter opener","I purchased one of these recently at a substantial discount which is the only reason I didn't rate it at one star. Other than the blade being reasonably solid metal and fairly sharp, the quality goes down from there. I had to spend time cleaning the glue used to attach the various sheath and handle decorations from the ""plastic"" handle and sheath. I would NOT give this as a serious gift to anyone I know. For a couple of bucks it makes a decent letter opener or possibly a paper weight. I would not knowingly buy a second product from the same manufacturer."
5,Another great gift,"Yep, another great gift for my boss. He will really like this one. It is fancy and would please any collector."
2,eh...,"I was rather disappointed. The foam inside the hilt was poor craftsmanship. The sheath doesn't stay on the blade very well, it wobbles in the sheath. Whatever is in the sheath to hold the blade marks the blade up. ...And it IS too large to be a proper sgian dubh. It worked in a pinch, but I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Traditional Scottish Dagger,This knife is a good buy for the price. It has a heavy blade and a hard sheath. The blade has a bright shiney look. The sheath looks a little like plastic but it is not. The detailing is nice. The blade is very sharp.
4,Good starter clarinet with minor quality problems,"My son is in 6th grade and this is the first year he has been able to join a school band. He wanted to play clarinet and I (knowing him so well) did not want to spend a bundle on an instrument until I knew he was going to stick with it.The Cecilio was a good choice. The sound is decent, and he has been happy with it so far (six months after purchase). A quality problem showed up when the thumb rest broke off after about 4 months. While we could probably get it fixed, he is able to use the clarinet just fine.The next cheapest clarinet we could find in town was over $500 so I feel good about buying this particular instrument. I know good instruments (we have several musicians in the family) and will step up next year, but this was great to start with."
3,"Fair, for the price","This is an inexpensive model that will be good for a true beginner, but don't expect great quality, and don't expect the instrument to remain playable beyond a year or two without some pricey repairs.My wife wanted to learn clarinet, so I bought this one for her. She played it regularly, and it lasted for about a year. After just more than a year it became unplayable. A very reputable local music shop advised us that it would cost $80 to repair, and it would probably need frequent ongoing repairs, so she decided to trade it in for a better clarinet."
1,Elementary School Band Director Review,"I have a degree in Music Education and have been an elementary school/middle school band director for 5 years. These instruments are terrible. The case is the nicest thing about them, and you're not buying your child a case... you're buying a musical instrument! The keys bend and break very easily and cause the instruments to be in-operable or very very difficult to play. Which makes class very frustrating for the kids and ruins their experience. Many repair shops won't work on them because in order to fix them all the keys need to be replaced because it's all made of the same cheap metal. The 'reed' the the instruments come with are terrible and if the kid can even get a sound out on them- it isn't a good sound. You'll wind up spending more money on the instrument than if you had just gotten a Yamaha or Buffet right from the start. Music & Arts has a very very affordable (as low as $19/month) rent-to-own program with quality instruments!"
1,BEWARE - AMAZON SHIPPED A USED CAMERA AS NEW,"Product arrived on time, but it was an open box item. The CD had been opened and then scotch taped shut. The packing materials were all messed up. The lens on the camera block was not protected, and the camera block was coated with drywall dust because it appeared to have actually been mounted at one point! I consider that a used camera!I've never had a problem with Amazon before. I have had problems with third party sellers on Amazon, but this shipped directly from Amazon."
2,Even the Outer Limits had a few clunkers! This is one.,"Well, after buying and watching this video as an adult, I can now remember why I never sat through the entire episode as a child - it was a bore! I dearly love the original ""Outer Limits"" television series but this episode was not one of its finest moments. A mediocre plot combined with mediocre acting (sorry, Scottie!) makes this one of the ""clunkers"". But realistically, EVERY television series, no matter how good, has ""clunkers"". This is a fact of televison production. If you are a new or casual fan and want a good cross-section of ""Outer Limits"" episodes on videotape, this is NOT one to get. However, if you are a devotee or a collector, unfortunately, ""you gotta have it""."
1,"Expanding Human, Extending Sleep Time...","A fine example of a interesting premise that goes nowhere. I would've loved to been in the board room on this one after hearing the pitch. ""That's the first five minutes, then what?""On a more positive note, the limited budget (typical of the second season) works ok here and the actors do what they can, given what little they have to do. James Doohan seems more an observer here than anything else. Also, the lead actor has Star Trek ties (Portraying Melekon in ""Patterns of Force"" and Dr. Sevren in ""The Way to Eden"").This one screams (well, maybe just mumbles) for a remake. With an expanded plot and higher goals for the bad guy (world domination, anyone?) it might just work."

4,Not Nearly as good as their others,"but it is still Paradise Lost even though it dosen't sound much like them. Hopefully they go back towards their old sound, or at least mix in their old sound with their new. This used to be one of my favorite bands. What happened?"
2,"Good Product, bad shipping company","I order this product for my son-in-law who lives 1200 miles away and had it shipped directly to his home. Bad idea, should have had it sent to my house so I could have inspected it first. It arived on time but the packaging was in very poor condition, as if it had sat in some corner of some store for months. Was dirty and appeared that it had been opended once and then returned. I was told it would be shipped by one company and in fact a different company shipped it. Needless to say I was not very happy. When opended by my son-in-law it wasn't a very impressive looking gift!"
5,Excellent Book,"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. The translation is amazing and every word is a gem. You will be amazed by how many questions this book will answer. I highly recommend this book even if you are not very spiritual.Quick tip: If you find yourself struggling to undestand some of the words in this book, I highly recommend looking that up in [..] or Wikipedia."
3,"Difficult to follow chapter notes, still nice","This is a letter written to a questioner by Imam Al-Ghazzali. The translation is a bit difficult to follow - especially after having read this in Arabic. Unfortunately, many of the arabic words are difficult to translate into english without thorough explanation. Though the translator does note these difficulties and explains the different plausible meanings of the words, it is hard to follow the references that are in the back of the chapter. It would have been much easier to place the comments and explanations in footnotes. Other than that, the translation seems very accurate. I enjoyed reading the letter. The translation of faysal at-tafriqah has recently been re-done by Dr. Sherman Jackson, and it is superior to the one contained in this book.Still a wonderful addition to your library."
2,What a Dissapointment,"I had high hopes that these videos would deliver, as advertised, a better understanding of my wifes T.W. horse. Well over half of the video(s) were spent telling you how HER tack was the only products to own and all others are crap. There were indeed a few tidbits of info to be gleaned but they were too few and way too infrequent. What we bought was a full-on commercial for Brenda Imas's product line and not much else, really disappointed. Also the first videos audio quality was really, really bad and made me want to use that DVD as a candle base and nothing more."
2,Very Disappointing,"I bought these DVDs thinking I would be able to better understand the tack and equipment my Tennessee Walking horses needed to be comfortable and perform at their best. When I called to asked questions about what I saw on the DVD they just referred me back to the DVD, no real answers, no real solutions. The customer service was horrible. It was like now I have your money and you are on your own sister. I will never buy another product from Brenda Imus again."
5,So addictive,Admittedly I was new to the game when I bought this . I had heard of them but I didn't know what they sounded like . I bought this and I haven't regretted it . This is something that is impossible to describe in words . If anything the music is incredible ( OK it has drills and the bleeps of mobile phones but all credit for experimentation - let it continue ).If you are intrigued by this band - I would suggest you buy this straight away . If the sound of drills and such like isn't for you then that's OK - whatever you are into is of your own concern .
4,interesting,"This 2-cd set of rare & previously unreleased music they did in the 90's shows some sides of Neubauten we hadn't seen before & offers more of what we knew. It has angular noise, futuristic minimalism that changes in increments over a vast fabric of repetition. Jarring ambience. There are some live versions of songs from 90's EN albums. They sound different live. It gets 4 stars because the music is so great. I can't give it more because the music is so uneven that it can be kind of hard to listen to sometimes. But I also feel like since this was released almost simultaneously with Berlin Babylon, their most solid album ever, they must have made this one so uneven on purpose...."
5,A Wondrous Story (or book of poetry),"Wendy's book is very beautiful. Not only are the poems insightful and enlightening, but Jon Anderson's artwork provides a unique view on both her work and in the workings of a modern artist who usually is known for his own poetry. Reading the poems and enjoying the paintings provides a nice respite from the normal material one reads."
5,NOT ONLY ROMATIC,"Fist time, I read this book in Chinese. It was so interesting that I read it more then ten times. The ending "" We are born, we suffer, we love, we die, but the waves continue to beat upon the rocks; the seed time and the harvest come and go, but the earth remains."" is the essence.I am touched by these characters. Now, I read it in English with checking dictionary. If you are an American, how lucky! Read it now."
3,Good but definitely a rip off of other books,"This is the first I've read by Victoria Holt. It was definitely an entertaining, fun book and in between juggling work and baby, finished it in about a week. However, it was so much like Jane Eyre that I was shocked. The dancing scene where the party interrupts them was also similar to Sound of Music when Maria is dancing with the kids to a local song. Granted, it was not exact and there was no secret, crazy wife or terrible fire or horrible childhood but the bulk of Jane Eyre was definitely similar to the context of this book. I did enjoy the book, but a little more originality would have been better."
4,Mystery of Mistress of Mellyn,"There is no count on the number of times I had read this book. It IS still intriguing. The description of the house and the mystery weaved around the house and the personification of the characters are especially good. This is a timeless piece. Maratha could be any next door girl. I loved this book and would like many others to read this book. But one thing while reading this book, especially the part where Martha dances for the first time unaware of Connan reminded me of Maria of Sound of Music. Lovely book . Great reading"
2,Mistress of Mellyn,"Victoria Holt had always been a favorite of mine in my younger years. However, I was afraid this book would prove to be ""outdated"" as it was written years ago. But I was surprised how interesting it was for me--it kept me guessing until the very end."
4,Love Victoria Holt,I really enjoyed this Victoria Holt book.She weaves mystery very well. I Like that her books are clean but still interesting.
4,good reading,i love victoria holt books and this was as good as any of her books! enjoyed the book a lot
4,Gothic romance galore!,This story rings all of the bells for a great Gothic romance. The tone of the narrator -a touch ominous and in awe- provides the perfect backdrop to the story. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
4,"Very nice, but wish all trim was metal","I like this faucet set, it looks great, but i wish all the exterior parts were metal instead of plastic."
5,happy buyer,nice quality coat. accurate sizing and it came quicker than expected. i am happy and so is my daughter!
5,until the end - blood in the ink,"I never truly appreciated hardcore, let alone music, until i heard this cd. The final track of the disc, ""Pull The Trigger"", is perhaps the highlight of the entire album. Using metaphors to convey their straightedge lifstyle to the lifestyle, it not only shocks but educates.There is a predictable pattern however to their musical writing. Towards the end of every song they engage in the traditional hardcore 'breakdown'. This is typical of any Tuff Guy Hardcore band. However, this crew's breakdowns are, in actuality, beatdowns. extremely heavy and sincere, this crew has definitely got its act together.Not for metal fans, not for the relatively new emo fans, and definitely not for anyone who lets music dictate their lifestyle."
4,Good licks to store in the back pocket for the next jam session.,"Obviously, the licks can be pretty much used for extending the solo which is near the ending of 'Stairway to Heaven'. However, these licks are pretty much diverse enough to play with other harmonies but not always in session. The licks are tasteful and has a bit of a hook established within them. The instruction is adequate. Good for immediate to advance. The instructor is clear and is able to articulate the lessons. He gives a plethora of ideas to choose from."
3,Winning Colonial America,This book is a winner if you want a good overview of the founding of America. Easy to read style with very good information although I'm not sure it's worth the $50+ I paid for it.
4,Good book. gives brief reviews of Early America,"this was a required book for a history class I took, and I must say, it wasn't boring. The history of the accounts in this book is brief, yet informative. It was a great study guide for tests."
3,Mislabeled,I thought I was ordering the book. I got the study guide instead. Wish it specified this on the site.
5,Couldn't find these saw blades at any hardware store around us.,And I already had the expensive scroll saw. Knew I could depend on Amazon for carrying them!
3,Strange but funny,This book was funny but I would be upset if I'd bought it new. No one in my house could figure out the moral to the story.
5,"Bananas - Tim Hawkins, Not so much Bananas","I originally purchased Tim Hawkins In Concert Full Range of Motion. I really enjoyed that DVD. So I thought that Bananas - Tim Hawkins should be just as good if not better. Well, It left me wanting more/It was just laking something to make it as funny as Full Range of Motion. Some of the material that was in Full range of Motion made it into Bananas, but since it was second hand jokes, the rest of the jokes where just a supplement to fill time and not his best work."
5,Hilarious!,Tim Hawkins is hilarious! My husband and I have watched this dvd many many times. Must watch if you like clean comedy.
3,Good But Not Great,I'll be up front-I LOVE Tim Hawkins later stuff- this just isn't him at his best. There is a lot of breaks where there is little to no punchlines AND there are a couple of funny but crude jokes. And one is not appropriate at all. I recommend this DVD to older viewers and for parents to watch this video before showing to younger kids.
5,Absolutely Hilarious,I use this movie for various social youth group events and the kids love it! Tim is great!
1,Not what I expected.,"I really don't know what kind of ""secrets"" I was expecting from this book, but I sure didn't find any. What I did find was a double spaced, huge font, instruction book that contained much of the same information that is found on the eBay site. Some chapters seemed to have promise, like HOW TO FIND PRODUCTS TO SELL, but instead disappointed with common sense answers such as, go to your local flea market or contact local wholesalers. This book would only be useful to the extreme novice with money to burn. To make matters worse, it seems that the author declined the use of a simple spell and grammar checker. My advice is to pass up the book and simply go to eBay and read the user bulletin boards and F.A.Q.s."
1,Waste of time and $$,Not useful at all. You could learn everything in this book by clicking around ebay for half an hour. The author claims over 10000 ebay transactions but does not even reveal his ebay ID!
1,! - STAY AWAY! WORSE BOOK EVER- !,Please for the love of god get rid of this book. Amazon should pull this book and sue the author/publisher for false advertisment and false identification.I can gurantee most if not all of those 5 star ratings are either by the author or family members.Geez grow up mike and learn to write proper english.AVOID THIS BOOK LIKE THE PLAUGUE! Petition Amazon to remove this book from their list.
1,I feel dumber for having read it...,"I was interested in purchasing this book before I was scared away by the reader reviews. By chance, I happened to find it at a garage sale and for 10 cents I just couldn't pass it up. What a waste of a perfectly good dime! It really is the worst thing I have ever read. I feel stupid for having wasted 45 minutes of my life reading it.In addition to the countless spelling and grammatical errors, there is also absolutely NO information in this book that you cannot get for free by reading the Ebay help section for new users and believe me; the Ebay site will explain it much more clearly.I have to wonder if the reviewers who say this is the best book they've ever read have ever really read another book! I've read better written mattress tags. Save your money and your time.Please Mike, stop having your mother write five-star reviews for you and for Pete's sake, learn how to spell!"
1,Like buying canned Air,"This brief, apparently self-published volume, is an example of sombody just trying to make a buck by praying on unsuspecting souls. We are not supposed to judge books by their covers. But seeing this guy holding fists full of cash should be warning enough. It should remind you of an infomercial all promise no content. Once inside, he offers no insights or advice of any merit. You'll learm more on ebay or through experimenting selling some merchandise."
5,Overall the book was nice.,I would like to give the book a 4.5 star rating but since there is no half in the rating system I went ahead and gave it a 5 star rating. It covers everything a person needs to know to sell on eBay successfully plus goes into customer service. The reason it doesn't get a 5 star rating is I would have like to have seen just a little more detail in the way to buy wholesale. If you are new to eBay and online auctions then I would recommend you buy this book. If you are already a so-called expert on eBay and know all the ends and outs of selling I don't know if you will pick up a whole lot more than what you already know. The only exception would be maybe the emails after the auctions have ended. Those I really do like a lot and should get a 5 star rating.
1,A big disappointment,"I ordered this book to discover the ""secrets"" of making big bucks on Ebay. For an overpriced, 74-page, double-spaced BOOKLET, it's the author who's cashing in. The first 50 pages of the book are devoted to ""step-by-step"" instructions on how to use Ebay. You don't need the book for that; anyone should be able to follow the instructions on the screen. The catchy title caught me - I should have known better than to buy a book that I suspected would tell me little that I already knew."
1,English lessons would help....,"The author of this small book may have all the secrets of getting rich on EBAY -- but until he learns the fundamentals of the English language, including punctuation and sentence structure, he should avoid trying to write about his knowledge."
1,"Do NOT buy this ""book""","I don't normally leave negative comments but this book is a total joke, and Amazon.com should pull it. Theres better books out there about Ebay written by real authors. Check under Dennis L. Prince, Neil J. Salkind, Nancy L. Hix, or Arden Snyder. They documented using Ebay much better than this incompetent clown. I agree -- 5 star ratings were written by the author and I use the term author lightly."
1,at least I didn't pay full price,"I only paid 9.99 for this one because I bought it off of ebay (I'm pretty sure it was used). I should have known better than to buy something with such a catchy title. Boy, was I surprised when it told a newbie like me everything that I already knew."
2,I wasn't too impressed,"This book is ok for beginners. However, if you beginners want to save yourselves 14.95 just look at the ebay tutorials on selling. I was expecting some secrets how to get cheap merchandise and perhaps some helpful tips on selling (ie: international bidders, how to effectively deal with deadbeat bidders, how to manage 100+ auctions at one time, or even some basic html to make my auctions look nicer). I didn't get any of that. So, I don't think that anyone needs to spend that much for information that is free. Sorry."
5,El Disco esta disponible en CD.,"Compre este CD hace algunos anos en Mixup en Mexico, que buenas memorias de la infancia de sentarme con Alberto Lozano en la Peña del Sapo Cancionero en Satelite, cantando estas canciones..."
3,"Decent Overview, but...","I'm not sure which release the other reviewer was listening to when he said ""the sound quality will blow you away"". I have Ratt and Roll 8191 and the only major difference I find is the recording level is higher on THE ESSENTIALS release. There is still an audible distortion crackle after the first note of BACK FOR MORE. This should have been cleaned up if it had been remastered properly.I am not happy about the way The record companies slap on a digitally remastered label and call it good, without really spending much time making the recording sound cleaner with less errors.I believe the CLASSIC MASTERS series from Capitol Records outshines the ESSENTIALS series hands down."
3,Ratt - 'The Essentials' (Warner),"The title notes these are the 'Original Master Recordings'.Are they sure about that?Quality seems to be a bit lacking here.Don't get me wrong,if you liked Ratt in their prime like I did,this twelve track compilation shouldn't let you down too hard.We get four tunes from each of Ratt's first three albums.Personally,I haven't heard ""Dance"",""Way Cool Jr."" or ""Heads I Win,Tails You Lose"" in sometime now.Pretty much aimed at Ratt completists."
5,Ratt n Roll Forever!,1. Round And Round 2. Back For More 3. Wanted Man 4. Lay It Down 5. You're In Love 6. Dance 7. Way Cool Jr. 8. Loving You Is A Dirty Job 9. Givin' Yourself Away ..... need I say more?
2,Waste of manufacturing time...,"First of all, I have to give this collection at least 2 stars because it is RATT after all and there are some great tunes here. But in general, the Essentials series sucks. They try to put the big over-played radio tunes and leave out killer album cuts and fan favourites. They only have two tracks from Dancing Unvercover, my favourite Ratt release. The material from Detonator is the slow ballad crap and not the really high energy stuff. What a disappointment. Do yourself a favor and buy Dancing Undercover. If you still don't like Ratt after listening to that album, you never will."
2,A truly pointless budget compilation,"Budget compilations are by definition lacking, usually leaving out major hits in favor of obscure numbers that don't appear on more ""proper"" greatest hits albums. This one is an exception in that EVERY song on here also appears on the far superior ""Ratt N' Roll 8191"", which has many more songs. The only benefit to this one is the remastering, but I'll take more songs over slight sound improvement any day. Get RNR8191 instead, you can't go wrong."
2,Good New Age! Mediocre Smooth Jazz!,"Mark and his wife, Brenda wrote, produced and recorded all the tracks, 19 of them compiled into this CD. This is one ambitious project! Maybe a little too ambitious. Contemporary Jazz lovers might be disappointed with the selections that are geared towards the genre. A few of the tracks, ""Midnight Satin"" for one, sounded like it was off key at times. However, there are some good moments. New Age music lovers will be impressed with the variety of tracks. Many of the tracks, especially ""Candlelight"" & ""Homestead"" will remind listeners of Windham Hill selections. If the New Age music genre is your fancy, this CD has plenty to offer."
1,Very annoyed,"I purchased this as a gift, well in advance of when I gave it. Imagine my surprise when we finally got around to viewing it to discover that of a FIVE disc set, we had TWO DISC # 3 and NO DISC #4.Neither Amazon nor Mars would make good on it because of the extra month or so 'til we discovered the mistake. Anyone need an extra DISC # 3, Third Season?"
5,great family show,"Great family show! Heartfelt writing, good acting! Can't wait for the last season to come out on dvd although I will be sad to see the end."
5,Everwood is the best,"I was hooked on this series from the start. I have watched it all on TV but I want to own all of the DVDs as I will watch this series again and again. Such a big shame it finished when it did, far superior to any other programmes I can think of. Hope they release the rest of the series soon."
1,Not worth it,I purchased these clipper several months ago and have been very disappointed in them. I have a Maine Coon and these barely made a dent in his fur and pulled the hair. I would NOT recommend these.
1,Not good,This product jammed frequently. Not good for medium length dog hair. I had to return it. I wish I would have read more reviews about dog clippers.
4,An easy to read book,I found this book useful during last trip to Europe. I have all the information needed from this book to make an appropriate adjustment during the trip. Planning ahead of a trip as Dr. Saha outlined could have an enormous impact on the pocketbook of a traveller. Dr. Saha's suggestions saved us lots of money during our trip and perhaps most importantly the chances of being robbed or cheated. I recommend this book for travellers anywhere.
1,toy not as advertised,"This item is listed at being a set of 4 magnetic tops. I ordered 3 sets and got 3 tops. They seemed just fine, though small, but I never opened them because they were definitely NOT worth the price as individual items. Returned them immediately. I was extremely annoyed and disappointed."
1,"First, you only get 1, not 4. Second, the 1 you get will be broken","We tried 3 times to get this right. I can't believe it's still being sold on Amazon. We ordered this set of 4, and 1 came in the mail, and the stem was broken. We called Amazon and were told they would refund our money and to re-buy it, since the website says 4, we would get 4. We ordered it again, and 1 came in, and the stem was broken AGAIN. We again called Amazon and they couldn't figure it out. They placed another order on their end and put in the memo field to the packer to include 4 pieces. Guess what, 1 came in the mail and the stem was broken again. The ship these in a bag, not a box. It was the worst experience trying to get the order right, which it never was. Stay far far away from these stupid trinket tops."
3,not very big (its not),"Very small... not like the sizes aren't given, but very small to what I expected. Use a ruler, make a prototype... it's really not that big."
5,Pretending to Be Normal,"It was fantastic to read this book, it was like she knew my daughter personally though she is not affected severly she has every single trait described. When I read page 110 I cried at the relief that I hadn't imagined why I knew she was different to my other 3 children. I feel very lucky that I can now understand her alot better."
4,Beautifully written.,Thank you to Ms. Willey for writing this wonderful book. Your life story helps me relate to my young son. This book is a MUST for anyone who has a loved one with AS.
2,Its Not a Disease!,"I didn't like how she kept referring to Aspergers as if it were a disease that she had to keep under control. To me, aspergers defines the way a brain is wired, and is not something to escape from or keep under control. I did not find this book ""hopeful"" or ""encouraging"" as others did, since it did not describe someone at peace with who they are."
2,Falls short of its potential,"I was disappointed with this book. First, I was surprised to read that the author has not been formally diagnosed with AS, although she admits that fact in an early disclaimer. This becomes more of an issue as Ms. Willey asserts that her AS traits are 'melting away' with age, a possibility that is as unprecendented as it is unbelievable from her own narrative. There were parts of the author's life story that came tantalizingly close to important revelations, but never went the extra step to realization. Still, her story held my interest enough to complete it. I would recommend ""The Essential Difference"" by Simon Baron-Cohen more highly than this book."
4,A place for everything and everything in its place,"I recently found out that my daughter has aspergers. It was in some ways devastating and in other ways a relief. I understand now. This book helps me understand. Though i haven't quite accepted it, i am beginning to. Books like this one are essential in helping communicate the seemingly uncommunicatable. Thank you."
2,"An aspie writes her experience, but needed a better editor.","Read the Appendices: they're lists of short thoughts relating to practical advice on how to live with the neurotypicals as a person with Asperger's.The narrative is foggy, unclear, disorganized, awkward, and sometimes hard-to-follow. It's not very useful, except that it's a perfect example of what the interactions between unsupported Aspie folks and the NT world can be like. In fact, I think it's an amazing illustration of the difference early intervention can make in the lives of people with Asperger's. Unfortunately, I think it's a negative example: don't let your kid turn out to be like this.A good editor could have turned this book into a really useful illustration of a coming-of-age success story. I don't see that that happened here."
3,misdiagnosed with AS,"I have some AS features that were largely due to my troubled upbringing, so I was misdiagnosed with it when I moved in with relatives as a teen. A marriage counsellor assigned me to read this as homework. It contains good insights into many communication barriers and interaction problems we all face. I believe it may be more helpful for women than men."
3,I'm looking for better books out there,"Great foreword by Attwood. I'll be looking for books by him. This book was not that helpful, I was hoping for more."
4,Pretending to be Normal,"This book is a must-read for those who may have AS or are related to someone who does. AS is a very subtle and pervasive set of characteristics. It would be easy to call it a disorder or affliction and for many it is just that, I suppose. This book helps you see the other side of AS, from the perspective of the person who has it. It may simply be a different kind of psychological wiring with its own gifts as well as drawbacks. Whatever it is, this book is very helpful for those who need to understand and accept it, to support those with it and for those who need support to adapt to, cope with, guide and nurture those who have it. And, on top of that it is an easy and engaging read!"
5,This book gave me hope,I really enjoyed Liane's story - it gave me hope that my Aspie daughter (and son) will grow up to have fulfilling lives.
2,Wordy,The book was informative but long expanations that are typical of a person with Asperger's Syndrome. It did give me insight to my 33 year old sons sociability. He loves to write research papers. He has a master degree in Human Resourses.
4,great reading,This was a very informative book about Aspergers Syndrome. I really gained insight into how Aspergers makes a person feel. It was well written and really explored the feelings of Liane. There were also some great school tips included for the older student.
5,compelling personal account of Asperger Syndrome,"I so admire this woman for sharing her story. I don't think I would have the confidence to publish my autobiography! Thankfully, Dr. Willey did. While I appreciate the academic books written on Asperger Syndrome, I have to say personal accounts are more meaningful to me. Of course, we are not each of us affected by Asperger Syndrome in the same way, but it is still so great to know there are other people who can at least relate to some, if not all, of what I live with. I have Asperger Syndrome too."
5,my favorite,"I remember this from my college days, it was my favorite.It seemed to cover all my emotions from breaking up with a boyfriend to the sheer joy of living. A great album that I have been watching for a long time."
4,Completely satisfied,CD is in good condition and shipping time was very reasonable. Would patronize again.
4,Decent bathroom library addition,If you love Busiek this thick black and white digest is a decent buy but not high quality r/t paper used.
3,Noise Therapy rule,"Last night ( 2003.5.3 ) i went to Noise Therapy 's concert . Oh oh my lord .Noise Therapy did a amazing show !! So after show I bought a cd of Noise Therapy . In fact i have download their a few of song before i buy their album .When i back to home and turn on my stereo .YEAH .Most of track on this album is worth listen to !! Anyway i recommend this album to nu metal fan , Go out and buy it !!"
3,Not as heavy as I hoped.,"When I first heard a few songs by these guys I was quite intrigued. I ordered the cd not realizing both the songs I'd heard were on the other album! Anyways, the cd turned out to be not too exciting. I've found 2 or 3 songs I really like off of it, but most of the time it's just not heavy enough(but I'm a fan of stuff like Cannibal Corpse and Slipknot). If you want something heavy, check No One. Hopefully, the previous album is better."
3,"Attractive to the eye,but high notes are wrong","My daughter wanted a red clarinet for her second year of studying the instrument.I got one, She loves it !But her teacher does not, he says that the high tunes are not high enough, tried replacing the barrel to a longer one, but then the internal volume of the clarinet makes other notes sound bad.So, it might be good for a first-year/junior parade, but I really don't understand how the manufacturer does not fix such obvious problem."
4,Can be tricky to install,Our receptionist tried to install and had a problem. After some fiddling we were able to get it installed. The middle roller was tricky.
3,Track Listing,1 Let Your Love Flow - The Bellamy Brothers2 I'd Really Love to See You Tonight - England Dan & John Ford Coley3 If You Leave Me Now - Chicago4 Baby Come Back - Player5 Laughter in the Rain - Neil Sedaka6 Baby I'm-a Want You - Bread7 Sad Eyes - Robert John8 Just When I Need You Most - Randy Vanwarmer9 Escape (The Pina Colada Song) - Rupert Holmes10 Kiss You All Over - Exile11 Don't Give Up On Us - David Soul12 Babe - Sytx
1,"The only book I've read, and never finished","This book envelopes the art for arts sake theory. If the author could get any further away from writing a good book of fiction, I might almost be impressed by his steadfast ambition to write rubbish."
2,No real solutions,I found this book to offer no real-life situations or worthwhile suggestions. If I had the chance I would return it. The context of the book simplifies the situations workers deal with everyday.
2,With a grain of salt... Please!,"This is a compilation of a newspaper advice column with some very subtle tongue in cheek humor which could land an ardent advice follower into hot water if taken too literally.Some interesting and some unconventional approaches to dealing with common work place issues relating to""... people problems and problem people..."".Some insights are pretty much common sense responses which most people ignore to follow, but can proactively prevent people from encountering a majority of work place problems and people."
1,Poorly edited,"I feel like sending this book back and requesting a refund. Within a few minutes of reading it I came to the conclusion that CareerPress sorely needs to hire more editors and proofreaders. Within the first half of the book alone, I stumbled on so many pronoun disagreements (he-she, him-her) and other typos I had to stop because the errors made my reading speed so ""jerk""-y."
3,Not what I expected,I was disappointed with the content of the book. I was looking for more academic approaches to problems with people not just situational examples.
3,Too specific if you seek general information,"The book will be superb help if you seek answers to the specific questions in the book. However, if you seek overview, or general insights, this is not it. The book is made up of Questions and Answers from the author's newspaper column. I found Crowe's book ""Since Strangling isn't an option"" far better for my goals. She offers wider insights to managing your own responses."
4,This is a beautiful book!,"I find the concepts easy to grasp and the demonstrations clearly laid out. A few more demonstrations would be useful but not necessary. I've been struggling to move to a looser, more emotional painting style and this ""simple, fast and focused"" concept seems to be just what I need to point me in the right direction."
4,Mel Stabin captures the essence of watercolor,"Using Stabin's formula of the ""big three"", simplify, think and focus, will lead to beautiful, clear and appealing paintings. Very helpful for beginning to experienced painters. Color illustrations of Stabin's own work provide an excellant example of capturing the essence of watercolor."
1,Safety issues,"I purchased this book before starting a biodiesel project with a local community development group. After researching, designing, building, and operating a biodiesel processor for myself, I would not recommend this book. It promotes open reaction tanks, which would expose the user to toxic methanol fumes, and possibly splashing methodixe- a corrosive, flammable chemical used in making biodiesel. It also says that washing biodiesel is unnecessary, which could cause engine damage. When researching biodiesel, please be careful- use only closed methanol and mixing tanks (wash tanks aren't as big of a concern), and make sure to learn all about the safety aspects of the titration chemicals and the storage of methanol. Here's to happy, safe, ""brewing""!"
4,Easy to read and to the point,"Excellent book for anyone interested in alternative energy and environmental issues. The authors make a brief but persuasive argument that biodiesel is simple, proven technology that could largely end US dependence on foreign oil and radically improve urban air quality.The only thing I missed in the book is more detail about the environmental superiority of the diesel engine compared to spark-ignition gas engines. Contrary to conventional wisdom and the (admittedly well-meaning) beliefs of most environmentalists, diesels (even when run on fossil fuels) are in general less damaging to the environment than gas engines. When diesel engines are run on biodiesel there is no contest---emissions are radically improved and the fuel consumed actually contains more energy (from the Earth's standpoint) than was used to produce it---because it comes from plants, which absorb free energy from the sun."
2,From the Fryer to the Fuel Tank,"Excellent , how to technical reference, easy to read and understand, a must have book for those interested in biodiesel, and / or waste vegetable oil."
4,From the Fryer to the Fuel Tank: The Complete Guide to Using Vegetable Oil as an Alternative Fuel,Very helpful but quite thechnical...
4,Track Listing,"Track Listing1. Question Of Faith (7"" mix)2. Question Of Faith (Liquid Boys Mix Edit)3. Question Of Faith (Disco Central Mix)"
4,Inking lessons from the best ones,"This is a must. First part of the book follows the usual terms on drawing manuals: talks about materials, technics and so. The best comes next, when you get a group of examples inked by different known artists, each of one explained by them, talking about the work. And, also, explaining how did they do it (what kind of brushes, pens, focus of their work...)"
2,A Little Disappointing,"First of all I want everyone to notice that this is only VOLUME 2. Volume one is no longer available anywhere. Thus, making this book fairly useless. The only thing that it's really good at it showing different stiles between professional comic book inkers. It nice to page through and I don't regret buyin it but it is not necessary for an artist's library."
2,Very disappointed...,"I know how to draw (or at least, I think I do) but I never learned how to finish a pencil drawing with ink. So I was totally looking forward to having a professional give me pointers on how to lay down a decent line.But this book tells you nothing. For starters, it's not even a book. It's more like a pamphlet, it's so frigging short. I think it's only about 65 pages.Secondly, you are NEVER told how to put a line of ink onto a page. Nothing. No explination. All they do is tell you what brushes or pens some guys like and give you some before (pencil) and after (inked) drawings.But you're never told how to hold your pen or brush, how to drag your instrument, or how to actually make a good looking line. VERY FRUSTRATING since that is exactly what I thought I was paying for.-DanP.S. I learned later that this 'book' is apparently the 2nd of two books. I've looked everywhere for the 1st book but nobody seems to sell it."
2,Great book-if you have a law degree (very dense reading),"I am about to be a published author. (scheduled for the summer of 2000) My hero is William Zinsser, author of On Writing Well. I like him because he writes so...well. Mr. Crawford needs to read Zinsser's book-several times. To be fair, Mr. Crawford's Legal Guide is organized and thorough, but the wording is stiff and technical. I feel as though I am reading a college law (or business) text book. He has no humor. I have an urge to drag out my yellow highlighter because there will be a test later. I am convinced I can read about anything if the material is well written. Mr. Crawford is always grammatically correct, but I have to work too hard to understand him. Legal Guide would be a wonderful book if you have a background in law or business. Since I have neither, I recommend Bunnin and Berens, The Writer's Legal Companion. The style is friendlier for new authors who lack experience in the business of contracts, copyright and publishing."
5,I love it!,"I grew up in Knoxville Tennessee which is where these calls took place. If you quote anything John said on this recording to a TRUE Knoxvillian they will know exactly what you are talking about. In East Tennessee you can threaten to whup somebodys a** as long as you put ""huh"" on the front of it. Try it. This recording (in the form of a tape) has been in my household for as long as I can remember. Probably like 15 years. We always just called it Leroy Mercer or whup-a**. I didn't even know the guy's name or his story until recently. This man was hilarious! It is terrible how those other guys ripped him off. Fact is, this guy IS the real deal."
1,horrible,this is one of the worst CD's I have ever listened to in years. The quality is horrible- the comedy is horrible- any Roy D. Mercer lover will hate this.
4,Technical but good,This was a more technical book than we were looking for. I used to event and my daughter is starting to get interested but she's still working towards it.Practical Eventing was a little beyond her understanding but I enjoyed it and it resparked my interest in an old favorite.
1,Absolute loser of a book,"Author gives no clue as to what the final dough should be like - soft - firm ??? Who knows. Tried the recipe for ""Peach Pockets"" and the end result wasn't worth the time it took might as well as used a Bisquick dough. The recipe for ""Tuscan Bread wasn't any better - his description of making a biga is very sketchy and doesn't jive at all with examples found on-line and the dough even after adding more flour than was called for remained very sticky and un bread dough like. Very disappointing."
4,This was a good read...,"This book started off kinda slow, but it ended up being a GREAT READ. The characters were well developed which in my opinion is what brought the book out. The white girl in this book had alot of drama going on didn't she? I would recommend this book and I will be reading more of this author's novels!"
4,A Great Book! A Real Page Turner!,"This was the 1st of Ms. Jackson's books that I read and I could hardly put it down! It's really good to have a wonderful young black female author who really knows how to put it down and represent black women as we really are: smart, savvy, full of attitude and spirit. You go, girl!"
5,EXCELLENT reading in the BEAUTY SHOP!!!,"Blessings!!! Blessings!!! Blessings!!! I started to read this book while I was in the BEAUTY SHOP. I get my hair down weekly so this was the only time I had to read. I must say, reading Blessings while in a Beauty Shop makes the reading much more entertaining. There are 4 women in the shop at Blessings and there are 4 women at the shop where I get my hair done. The personality of Pat, Faye, Zuma and Sandy fit the personalities of the Stylists' at the salon. It was amazing...sad..funny all at the same time. The only bad point in the book was Sandy - and her lost. The question, ""why does it take so LONG in the beauty shop?"" My answer, I'm glad it does, I was able to finish the book in 3 appointments!!!!"
4,This is my Favorite out of all her books!!,"I really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it. You can definitely see Ms. Jackson's growth as a writer with this work. However, I would have loved to know what happened with Zuma. Did she get pregnant? Did she get back with Taj? Also, I wanted to know if Faye and Mr. Watson get together. Other than that, I really enjoyed this book and look forward to Ms. Jackson's next release."
2,Sheneska you can do much better!,"This book could have been done better. It was way over the top with the mama-drama. The concept was great but some of the melodramatic stuff can be calmed down, greatly. The novel itself could be reduced because some things seem at bit unrealistic."
4,ENJOYABLE READ,SHENESKA HAS DONE A GREAT JOB BRINGING THE LIVES OF THESE FOUR WOMEN TO THE PAGE. THE CHARACTERS ARE TRULY BELIEVABLE. THE READER IS TRULY ABLE TO INDENTIFY WITH ALL FOUR WOMEN. I FOUND IT AN ENJOYABLE. I DIDN'T FIND IT PREACHY AT ALL. IT IS A KNOWN FACT THAT IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY WE ALL PREACH AT EACH OTHER. IT IS OUR WAY OF SHOWING THAT WE CARE AND OUR CONCERN. THIS BOOK GAVE ME NEW INSIGHTS ON PARENTING AND THAT CHILDREN ARE TRULY A BLESSING FROM GOD
3,"fast-paced with a few ""lulls"" in the story line","The author intertwines very nicely each characters' past life with their present situations. However, the author's physical description of the characters may not match what the reader imagines them to be. Parts of the ending are predictable, and the adoption situation is really not believable at all, but it is still worth reading for entertainment."
5,YOU GO GIRL!!!!,"This book was da-bomb!!! I have read all of Ms. Jackson's books and this was the best yet. Her other two novels were great as well, but this one just kept me turning the pages. I'm waiting for the next one to come out. Much love and peace to Sheneska Jackson."
5,Blessings Is A True Pleasure!,"'Blessings' by Sheneska Jackson is most certainly a blessing to read! This enchanting story is based around four women who work at a hair salon in Los Angeles. Pat, the store's owner discovers she is infertile and with the help of her husband, Mark, starts a long and hard journey to adopting a child. Faye, a biracial, widowed, mother of two tries to come to terms with her daughter's wild, reckless ways and a son who will never know his father. Zuma is a hip young woman who's past has come back to haunt her and makes her decide to become pregnant. Finally, there's Sandy, an ex-stripper also called White Chocolate, who's number one passion in life is mistreating her kids. The characters in this story are sympathetic and believable. The plot is also fast-paced and well-planned. There are no boring places in the book so it will certainly keep your attention. If you're reading this review, you've got to get yourself a copy. It is not to be missed!Theresa Harbinger"
5,This should be a movie (motion picture)!,"I just love this book. It was so real, you NEED tissues for this one. I love how Ms. Jackson got into the lives of each character, and made me feel like I could relate to all the different issues. I never been in any situation these women were in, but I know alot of women who are just like Sandy & Faye (I recomended the book to all of them). This would be a wonderfuel movie, not one part should be left out either. I loved it so much, I almost hope there would of been a series. Especially with the way the story ended on suspensful endings. PLEASE MAKE THIS A MOVIE, PLEASE it was toooooo good. Anyone reading this reveiw GO BY THE BOOK, and some tissues, this is going to make you cry over & over again. (No, I don't work for the author or the publisher I just loved it that much.)"
5,Excellent Book,This is a very good book to read. It keeps you moving through each chapter. The characters are believable as well. I have read Ms. Jackson's other books as well -- but this one I enjoyed the most. Keep it up Sheneska Jackson!
4,Another great book by this author,Ms. Jackson does it again. This young women has such an insight into human character. I'm sure we all know someone like the four women involved in the storyline. I can hardly wait for her next book!
4,Interesting book showing morals,"this was a good book to read with nice dialouge and events that happened, bu sometimes i thought that it was a bit detailed. i liked how she incorporated a white woman into a black beauty parlor that did not feel the same way about children. i especially like the part where she's in bed with a guy and his toenails were so jagged that they sractched her and made her bleed. that was quite hilarious."
4,"a little too soft, but entertaining","This book kept me interested beginning to end. All of the characters were interesting people with some serious issues in their lives. I was happy with the way everyone's drama played out except for Sandy's. I was very annoyed with the the fact that she was not truly made accountable for what she did throughout the book. I think the author showed ""acceptance"" of Sandy's behavior by not imposing serious punsihment! Otherwise, Faye was my favorite character as she was the most selfless and real. It was a nice adventure into 4 women's lives."
3,Difficult to read but otherwise enjoyable.,"Though I have enjoyed all of Ms. Jackson's book I found this one particularly hard to read. I found I had to skip through the parts with Sandy and her kids. The abuse and neglect I just couldn't stomach. But I did enjoy the other characters, especially Pat."
4,off the chain,This book was outstanding. I really really liked it because it was so truthful. I think Ms. Jackson came to my salon and studied us for her book. Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it ended so soon.
3,Something to Read,"Blessings was a very hard read. It took me two weeks to get through this book and that was very unusual for me. The story was very good but, I felt that the ending did not completely depict all four ladies. It is a good book to read if you just enjoying reading African American novels, like I do."
4,Funny and warm,"So why does it take so long when we go to the salon?The diverse characters in this novel make you laugh and keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. Blessings is the name of Pat Brown's salon as well as the theme of the main characters' lives. Each woman realizes that children are a blessing (Psalms 127:3) to their parents and to those desiring children.This novel begins with the humor, gossip, and bitterness of women in a salon. It progresses and culminates with the love they develop for one another and their children. Even Sandy who 'hates children' learns to love her daughter enough to entrust her with someone who can give her the love she deserves.A fun read!"
4,Great book with lots of humor and real issues,I enjoyed reading this book and thought that the plot was interesting and easy to get into. The characters were diversified and that gave the book some depth.
1,Why in the world??,would anyone buy this two cartridge pack for $69.87 when the two cartridges purchased as separate items from Amazon total $52.22and there's no shipping charge??Note - it's the pricing that gets ONE STAR - the cartridges themselves are great.
5,stroke survivor of the year 2005,"Great book, she has so much to say. She just received the stroke survivor of the year from SE Va stroke survivors of the year 2005. She spoke, was absolutly wonderful and the highlight of the evening for the banquet."
1,Did this guy even go to UMCP???,I just read this and it is absolute rubbish. Did he even go to UMCP... I cant even tell....
2,"Worse than Dawkins-lite, it's Dawkins-weak","This strikes me as just a watered down Reader's Digest version of Dawkins. As a scientist, I'm truly surprised that Sir Robert May endorsed this work. I thought he was more disconcerting than that. I found the final chapter of speculative religion totally out of place in an otherwise ho-hum redeaux. I particularly didn't appreciate having the book conclude with an argument from authority, even if it was from Einstein."
5,A first-rate work on the phenomenon of cooperation.,"In this easily accessible and poignantly written work, evolutionary biologist Dr. Lee Alan Dugatkin explores the mysteries behind one of nature's most perplexing occurrences: cooperation. With the rapture of a storyteller and the exacting eye of a scientist, Dugatkin weaves together strands of existing evidence (much of which, he notes, has been collected from his own laboratory) into a _highly_ original and insightful book. He moves adeptly from the empirical to the ethical as he discusses the implications and lessons of animal cooperation for human societies. As entertaining as it is educational, Cheating Monkeys and Citizen Bees, will no doubt appeal to readers on all levels. In short, it is required reading for anyone wishing to become familiar with the myriad of issues surrounding cooperation in nature."
1,Unoriginal and moralistic,"This book is a pastiche of Richard Dawkins, with the author's own moralizing thrown in. Something like 80% of the examples were lifted directly from Dawkins, along with all of the evolutionary theory (except the mistakes--for example, Dugatkin misunderstands what ""selfish genes"" means). He then adds on his own suggestions for shaping public policy in accordance with evolutionary ideas; this part is the most annoying, since he is both moralistic and naive; his suggestions are simplistic and preachy.Do not read this book. Read Dawkins instead: The Selfish Gene, The Extended Phenotype, and The Blind Watchmaker."
2,Sadly confused,"This book tries to do two things: summarize the findings of evoltionary thinking on the development of co-operation, and relate these to making humans more co-operative.On the first goal this book isn't too bad. it has a lot less meat than Ridley's book on co-operation, or anything by Dawkins. But as an intor for those new to this stuff it isn't too bad.When he tries to tie it to humans, and drags in his religion too, he makes a muddle of it. Some of what he suggests is just embarrassing.He is evidently confused on what is and is not group selection too.Read Axelrod, The Evolution of Cooperation or Ridley, The Origins of Virtue instead."
2,Not what expected,"After reading the great reviews I bough this book for my husband. Not at all what I had in mind. Three words about this book: weird, creepy, gross (dead dogs, really?). The cover is so misleading. I understand the author has a good reputation and all, but c'mon! Maybe I was just expecting too much. If you intend to buy it, I would check it out at a Library first to make sure you want your spend your money on this."
4,There is something askew...,"I really like these pliers and all but I think there is two different models or something. I have used one of these models by channellock before for tieing foundation wiring and it worked great. They were just the right size and functionality. The spring is very handy for all day work and they are easy to use. They didn't last long after that job was over but hey they were better for that job than my other pliers. They are a Klien brand. The Kliens are good but I actually prefered this smaller guy for the tighter jobs. The bent handle works on the fly and takes less strength for the tying. Good luck and happy tying. Not bad, but probably not the best in the long run. Works great though."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I'VE BEEN A LONG-TIME FAN, AND THAT'S WHY THIS RECORD HURTS MY EARS SO MUCH.... SHAWN SMITH DOESN'T FEEL LIKE SINGING HIS A** OFF ANYMORE. REGAN ISN'T LAYING DOWN HIS GROOVE ANYMORE. THERE WAS MORE EFFORT PUT INTO SHAWN'S SOLO ALBUM IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION AND SONGWRITING. DID HE RUN OUT OF IDEAS? IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW HOW GOOD AND HOW MUCH POTENTIAL THIS BAND HAD, CHECK OUT ""SHAME"", ""INTERIORS"", OR ANY SATCHEL ALBUM!!! I GURANTEE YOU AFTER GIVING THOSE A LISTEN, YOU'LL WANT TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY PIANO AND START A BAND."
3,Half gorgeous,"3 1/2This album does not disappoint, though it isn't a full success either, with the softer mid-tempo's vastly more palpable to the rockers- the former having admirable staying power with some keenly placed shifts."
4,"Not Shame, but an excellent record!","Brad returns (finally), and they don't disappoint. This record is a little more mellow, but it is classic brad. Shawn Smith is a genius songwriter. Buy this."
4,diverse musical influences,"Its been a long time since that last Brad album, maybe 5 years. This was one of my most eagerly awaited releases for this year, and it does not disappoint. It took a few listens to realize how good it really is. I think each bandmember has brought in their own influences to create a really solid album. Soulful, rockin', harmonious, folky, and beautiful. Stone has some wonderful melodic guitar work, and Shawn's voice is one of a kind. If you are already a fan, I am sure you will love this one too. It is not a radical departure from previous efforts, but it is a bit more diverse from song to song. One of the best bands around in my book. True musicians."
2,where is GMO info.?,"I dont see any information if this is GMO free?VERY Important to me! Chips supposedly containing no gmo, then finding out its a lie, like thoseone chips that tasted gourma, were expensive and said gmo free, but lied general mills bought changed name. nice"
4,MISFITS-cuts from the crypt,"""cuts from the crypt""is 1 of my favorite misfits cds b/c it has the 2nd best version of the ""MONSTER MASH""I ever heard!also""DEAD KINGS RISE""another of my favorite songs of all time and about my favorite song sang by ex.misfits m.graves,""FIEND W/O A FACE"",""BRUISER"",A killer version of ""THE HAUNTING""(W/ALT.LYRICS),""RISE ABOVE""w/dez on vocals!other than that it's just in general a misfits classic,a must for any TRUE fiend."
4,MISFITS IN THE ROUGH,"THIS CD IS A COLLECTION OF DEMOS. THEY ARE A LITTLE DRY BECAUSE OF THE PRODUCTION. BUT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF SONGS OFF ""AMERICAN PSYCHO""+OTHERS MAKE IT A WORTHWHILE COLLECTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A FAN OF MICHALE GRAVES ERA MISFITS. SORRY DANZIG FANS NOTHING FOR YOU. THERE ARE SOME THROW-AWAYS, BUT ON A WHOLE IT'S PRETTY GOOD. BUT I REALLY LIKE THE MICHALE GRAVES/Dr.CHUD-ERA MISFITS, AGAIN SORRY DANZIG FANS."
4,CLICK THE BUY OPTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are a Misfits fan click that buy option .you really need to have this in your Misfits collection.Micheal Graves delivers,i love his voice.Misfits are not dead cuz Danziggy is not here.This CD Rocks!!!! just like American Psycho and Famous Monsters does and I hope their will always be a new Misfits CD to buy.I really love Cd.......and you will too!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,gory gory hallelujah,"Cuts From The Crypt is a fiendish compilation which includes bllody good cuts like 10,000 Years B.C., Fiend Without A Face, AND we even get the full version of the Abominable Dr Phibes! I bloody love it!"
1,horrible,"I thought i'd give Michael Graves a chance. It failed. He is not Danzig. If u know anything about the real Misfits u'd know that Danzig was the band. He wrote all the songs, he made the fiend club, he managed every aspect of the band. He was the Misfits! U wonder why Danzig wants nothing to do with them now, its obvious. They are now a joke. Michael Graves has a good voice and would have been good in another metal band but not the misfits. Jerry and Doyle should have hung it up and let it go. Chud also! Not the Misfits!"
1,X-Digital Rebate Fraud,"DO NOT BUY THIS CARD! As other posters here have suggested, do a quick google on it, and you'll see that X-Digital does not honour rebates. (They still haven't for me either, 5 months & dozens of calls/emails later.)The card itself seems OK - it's just X-Digital's (lack of) business practices that should stop you from buying this."
2,"Card not worth buying, and no support","I bought this card about 8 months ago. The company refused the rebate and Amazon had to cover the $50. I discovered that the card has a bad spot, but now there is nothing I can do about it because the company apparently does not stand behind their product and wishes to remain more anonymous than anything. Not a bargain compared to similar cards like Kingston Elite."
1,"Good card , BAD BAD company","I was also denied the rebate on this product from X-digital. They first claimed I sent it in too late but I am positive I sent it in on the last day possible. (this short time-frame is ridiculous anyways)I then called the rebate processing company to complain. They told me they NO longer represent this company and gave me a direct number to X-digital. I called 3 times and left a messages each time. They never even bothered to call me back ! I emailed amazon and explained the situation and hope they can do something. If not I will dispute the charge on my credit card.People, BOYCOT X-DIGITAL !"
2,Becareful - shipping charges,Make sure that when ordering anything from Amizon.com that the total of your order OVER $25.00. May last order was $25.00 on the head and I was charged over $9.00 in shipping for something that could have fit in my shirt pocket. So much for the free shipping.
2,Okay at Best. Here are a couple better options.,"I find this one is basic and limited. You can only find rhymes based on sounds. A good rhyming dictionary should cross-reference both sound and spelling.I couldn't easily find a rhyme for the word ""exit"".I would recommend the Penguin or the fully executed Oxford. The Penguin is a good one for a backpack or travel or carrying a lot. The Oxford is excellent as a stationary at home or at work because it is hard cover."
4,mERRIAM wEBSTERS rHYMING dICKTIONARY,"BOOK IS EXCELLENT, HAVE PREVIOUS EDITIONS, AND USE THEM ALOT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO OTHERS AS WELL"
4,Low price dropping seat post and does everything it needs to do.,"I had to get this and a shim because my seat post is a 30.0mm and no one makes one that size. The quality is nice. The remote seemed really cool, however my only complaint is that the seat seems to rise about half of its stroke then is very slow the rest of the way. I found myself assisting the seat with my hand the rest of the way. Eventually I just put the seat lever on (which is also included) which eliminated the extra cable routing and simplified my setup. Since i pull the seat and lever manually the slow rise is no longer an issue. Over all it is great, I couldn't imagine riding with out it now."
2,Smaller Than Appears,"Overall a nice product, but much smaller than appears in the photo. More suitable for a younger child. I ordered for a 9 year old, and was disappointed."
5,Great craft,"We got these for our daughter's birthday party. The girls loved decorating them and the selection of paint/stickets/glitter was good. It is a small box, but perfect for small jewelry. Overall they were a hit and we'll probably do more of the Melissa and Doug DYO in the future."
5,Great product!,I ordered this for my kid cousin for Christmas. She loved it and her mother said it was adorable! She decorated it immediately.
3,flimsy... I dont like this opener.,"Opener is not solid, it is flimsy, and shakes at the joints, feels and looks like a cheaply made wine opener."
2,Cheap plastic,"I work in hospitality industry and a good wine key is very much appreciated . This is not the case with this one. It is made out of cheap plastic, be aware the name will trick you. Just get Pulltaps and you will not go back."
5,much better than the $5 options,"for just a little bit more money than generic corkscrew, you can have a screwpull. i was tired of having my $5 corkscrews break apart on me so i opted to spend a little more and boy am i glad i did. it's very solid feeling and looks to be built to last and the 2-step key makes for easy work of any length cork. highly recommended"
4,Top Notch corkshrew,This corkscrew works well with my arthritic hands. And it does what it is supposed to do--open wine bottles.
4,(Mostly) the best corkscrew I've ever owned,"I prefer waiter-style corkscrews over other designed for not only their simplicity and portability, but their effectiveness, too. They are far superior at removing stubborn or deteriorated corks than almost any other design.The biggest flaw in most cheap corkscrews (waiter style and otherwise) is that the ""screw"" is generally made too thick or too thin. Too thick and it breaks apart the cork, too thin and the screw rips right out of a delicate cork. This one is just right. Generally I lean toward teflon coated screws as they work smoothly and damage the cork less, but the design of this coated stainless steel screw works very well.My only real complaint is that the hinge is very tight and it takes some struggling to open up the corkscrew. Hopefully it will loosen up over time. I'm not sure where the reviewer who called it ""flimsy"" got theirs. Mine is very tightly constructed and not at all ""flimsy""."
3,it's ok,"This corkscrew is big and clunky and does not work as smoothly as the Pulltex Pulltap's. However, we will keep it for travel because the case is handy and we won't be upset if it's lost or stolen."
4,Legend of the Organ,"""Brother Jack"" is the second of organist Jack McDuff's discs in the now OOP Prestige ""Legends of Acid Jazz"" series. It collects two excellent albums on one CD, the original ""Brother Jack"" LP recorded on January 25, 1960 and ""Goodnight, It's Time To Go"" from July 14, 1961. Both were made at Rudy Van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs studio with a couple of first rate quartets -- the former featuring Bill Jennings on guitar, Wendell Marshall on bass and Alvin Johnson on drums, and the latter Harold Vick on tenor sax, Grant Green on guitar and Joe Dukes on drums. These are both smokin' sessions, and soul jazz fans should take advantage before this legend disappears."
3,One of the weekest GUs,"DJ Paul Oakenfold's Global Underground New York was highly dissapointing, I Have about half of the Underground series and I find this one to be the worst of the lot. Tranceport was the first progressive disk I heard and I was amazed. Although Tranceport is a little dated and kind of a greatest hits album of trance, it really got me into progressive music and trace. This album however, fell well short of my expectations. It did have it's moments but there are some much better selections in the global underground series such as Sasha-Ibiza, Dave Seaman-Buenos Aries, and Nick Warren-(EVERYTHING). Some of the better tracks on Oakey's New York Series are Greece 2000, 3 Drives on Viynl on disk one and on disk two: Talisman+Hudson, Leave Planet Earth, amd CM, Dream Universe. All in all a decent disk but you can find much better Oakey and much better GU."
4,A really great CD but...,"A really great CD but I must say that the first 2 tracks on disc two just really don't appeal to me. Although, the last two tracks on disc two (especially Deeper Love) are beautiful. There usually has to be a track or two on an Oakenfold mix that I just cannot get into and to me it is the beginning of disc 2."
5,unbelievable,I hadn't been too happy with rave music (plz nobody be offended with my terminology) as of late (ie past two years). I picked this CD up yesterday. I went back 8 hours later to buy another copy. It's that good.
5,CD Hiding Place by Don Moen,Absolutely love this CD. I put it in my vehicle and listen to it every day. Very inspirational! The price was great and the shipping was rapid.
1,Does NOT work on Macs!!!,"I was disappointed to find that this software does NOT work on macs. We have an iMac. I popped in the CD, and when I click on ""Bailey's Book House"" to load, it says ""You can't open the application Bailey's Book House because the Classic environment is no longer supported."" I feel jipped. The product says Windows and Macintosh- I guess not the ones in this decade."
5,Awesome!,"This is literally an encyclopedia of LBGT stuff! If you ever wanted to know anything about Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, or Transgender subjects, this is the only book you might ever need!"
4,Not bad,Very helpful as resource material though a bit stretched in it's assumptions of certain myths. All together a good read.
4,IT's Hot But Too Short,The Beats are off the hook the lyrics are phat but the Cd should have been longer. It's better short than sorry I listen to the Cd from start to finish 100 times.
1,Talk about being suckered!,"I played Gamma world when it first came out and it was a huge joy in the fact that if offered more in each book. Detailed maps and indepth scenes were in abundence. When my amazon order for gamma world came in it was almost like the day my Harry Potter book arrived. Yet as I read the entire book I was disappointed since it like the quality and style of the orignal Gamma World, in fact I would like to point out that it is extremely weak since it relies heavily on modern D20 instead on its' own.So for those who bought the book it is a waste of money unless you have money to burn (which they are counting on).I honestly thought about the Gamma world history and why it happen as being lame. Who really cares about nanotech? All the dangers of nuclear, chemical, and bio weapons of mass destruction were reflected highly in the original gamma world. This one is a neutered version! Please do not waste your money!"
3,Great with flaws,"Look, it's obvious it was written by multiple authors who did not have a good editor (they should have hired me). Someone did not have a strong hand on the tiller, and the book is disjointed and has a multitude of rules problems, typos, and more. However, as a fan of Gamma World - I loved the new take on the setting with a focus on a nanotech and artifical intelligence Singularity apocalypse, and the book did its job. A far superior book was the game-master's guide, which was brilliant in its advice on how to run post-apoc scenarios."
4,to the guy from pakistan,because you pakis want a free ride! something for nothing. get a life and dish out the money you cheapskate.
3,Not Quite There,"First, I would like to say this is a terrific musical and the music is just beautiful. It's a joy to see and a joy to perform. This book, however, falls short. Not only is it missing many important songs, the key in which the songs are written has been changed. This is problematic if you are purchasing the book to learn a piece for an audition. Rehearsing a song in one key and then discovering when you are standing up there in front of an audition committee that what you practiced at home was a whole step lower than the way it is written in the full score isn't pleasant. Considering how low the entire show is to begin with, there was absolutely no reason to do this."
5,i love this book!,"i was in a class musical and i fell in love wiht the music from the play Once on This Island, months later i decided to get this book just so i could sing the songs, it has all of the famous (favourite) songs, waiting for life (a stranger in white), walk with me, and others. the only thing i found wrong was soe of the notes sounded different than on the cd. but oh well, nothing is perfect, they are great songs, very catchy, buy the book. :) -kara"
5,Wow,"This band never ceazes to amaze me. The vocals by far alone blow you off of your chair. They are deep, powerful and meaningful lyrics accompanied by a sensous and darkly intimidating voice. Many tracks to dance to and others to reflect apon. If you like to feel as well as dance, this is the CD for you. If you decide you like them, look into my yahoo group for diary of dreams. ~Yours in nightmares~"
4,An interesting mix of goth rock and EBM,"Diary Of Dreams is best described as a mixture of goth rock and EBM styles of music. The vocals are similar to what one would find with a goth rock band like Type O Negative, but there are some songs that carry a distinct beat and sound similar to an industrial/EBM band like Ravenous. Basically, it's purely electronic music with some electric guitar riffs here and there. Most songs on Freak Perfume are fairly laid back and slow (like Tram:A and O'Brother Sleep), but there are also some faster songs present to balance the pace (like The Curse and She). While some of the tracks seem to be lacking a certain spice in my opinion, Freak Perfume is still a good CD to have in your collection if you are a fan of either electronic or ambient rock genres. Not exactly a new concept, but try it if you're looking for something a little less abrasive."
4,Spooky,"The whole album has a sound that makes an atmosphere of spooky and sad. Listen to the lyrics and they dont make much sense together, but then when you dont pay attention, the lyrics creates imagery that complements the mood. In terms of sound, male vocalist with a heavy sound and slow tempo."
2,I was sent the wrong Item.,I order the narrow finisher trimmer blade as seen in the pic and was sent a the T-trimmer blade. I'm not happy.
5,The best of Motown!,"Here is the best of Motown. Here,you get classics recorded by the Supremes,Marvin Gaye,The Temptations,The Four Tops,The Jackson Five and others. Many of these classics were covered by a variety of artists including Michael Bolton and Michael McDonald. McDonald put out his MOTOWN album in 2003 and MOTOWN TWO the following year. The ex-Doobie Brother is quite a soul man. Bolton covered MY GIRL for his TIMELESS-THE CLASSICS VOLUME 2,released in 1999. This album is a must for fans of ""oldies but goodies"" and R&B. Many of these songs are played on classic R&B radio stations and Music Choice's Classic R&B channel."
5,Perfect Christmas Present,"My mom loves Motown, and she requested a Taylor Hicks CD. But while I was browsing in Amazon, I thought, ""let me find her something else"". She really enjoyes this CD. It takes her back to her glory days!! It was sent very timely, and in great condition, too."
4,Motown's #1's,A solid collection of Motown songs. Most of Motown's hit-makers are part of this. It's music from a time of fantastic singers. What you hear is what you get....not much technology around back then to help you out. A great deal for the price.
4,Bigger variety than normal,This album had some great music at a great price. I was surprised to see a variety of songs that include some newer ones. This is just fun music.
3,Motown #1's,"Ok mix of motown tunes, but some have been overly enhanced and do not sound like they did originally. Michael McDonald is notMotown!!"
3,Wouldn't have bought if it wasn't on special,I thought it was a good buy for .99. The album had a few songs I thought would be nice to own.
5,"Loaded with familure great songs,","I would recomend this album to anyone. Everyone knows these songs from late 60's and early 70""s but it's nice to own them now so I can listen any time I want to."
5,Motown #1's,If you like Motown music you will enjoy listening to these all time favorites. These classics never loose their appeal.
3,Motown,"It an okay various artist collection, wish did not have to add more words to rate this product, you know"
5,"Great sound, true to original recordings.",Very happy to add some Motown recordings that I did not have to my collection of all time favorite music.
5,Hey It's Motown-- gotta give five stars,"What can I say? It's Motown. Still as great as it was. If you like Motown, check out the DVD ""Standing in the Shadows of Motown."" It's a great movie/documentary."
3,Could be better,"There's some good music on here, but I wished I knew why they picked the songs they did. They missed some obvious good Motown tunes and a few songs that made it on here I wouldn't consider to be all that great (even if they did hit #1). Marvin Gaye did some good stuff, but why does he have 4 tracks on here?Several of the recordings sound poorly mastered (or maybe poorly recorded). Even if they are sold as 256kbps mp3's, they sound like old recordings that didn't have the full range and were recorded at 128kpbs then converted to 256 ... by that time the range and acoustics that help it sound good have been lost. Fortunately, most of the recordings don't have that problem and sound decent.Still, I got it on sale so it was a reasonable way to get some top numbers by the original artists. I don't think it's worth the full $9.49."
5,Great mix,Some real great tunes on here.Maybe not the best compulation you'll ever find but a damn good one. Covers Motown quite well.
3,aint no mountain high enough,I had to take a second look. Wish they had the tammi terrell marvin gave version - now thats soul http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz-UvQYAmbg
1,Not True Motown,"I have not bought this CD, I just reviewed the titles to see if there was anything that I didn't already have. I already own every song on there.It was pretty much the same mix of some motown from the 60's. There was nothing very exciting. Then they added some songs that are NOT even close to being motown.BoyzIIMen IS NOT MOTOWN!"
4,OK for 99 cents,There are some really good songs on this set; however I wouldn't have bought any of them individually. And Amazon had that great special for 99 cents for the set. For that much I feel it was well worth it. And Amazon sucked me into using their cloud for the download. I then ported it over to my itunes --- flawless and easy. Nice job Amazon!
5,Classics!,"Exactly what you would expect from a Motown collection. The sound quality on my computer is better than I expected, and also through my MP3 player. I have not yet played them back through a stereo. Since it is a complete collection, and because I can choose to ignore them, my only small complaint is the more recent hits: in my opinion they just don't compare to the classics."
4,Lots of childhood memories,"This is some of the music I remember from growing up and helped shape me into the person I am today. Music with a message, with soul, and with a deeper meaning..."
5,Nice collection of Motown classics,"I would recommend this compilation to anyone who enjoys or wants to get into the Motown classics. Within this collection you'll find some of the most popular songs from the motown era. You'll find yourself in good company with Jackson 5, The Supremes, The Tempations, Four Tops, Smokey Robinson, Commodores, and plenty of others. The playlist is worth it even if it's just to play for a Motown themed party or something different in shuffle mode."
4,"For less than a buck, so many classics!","So when Amazon sold this album for 99 cents, I jumped on it and am not disappointed.For you audiophiles, I do notice that the songs need to be remastered to sound better. The sound is oddly flat and distorted at times, especially the bass frequencies.But this is still better than I remember them on the AM radio and I am thankful to Amazon for helping me finally own these classics."
5,Nice henna!,"I used it for my hair. I like it. I haven't tried it for henna tattoos, but it is great for hair."
2,Not Pure Henna,"If you are looking for pure, finely sifted henna...this is not it. This product is gritty and hell to wash from hair. I am assuming that this product contains some additive (sand?) to bulk up the weight. The color is also not that of pure henna. The dye content is also weak."
4,Satisfying application+Minor probs rinsing=Happy Consumer,"is nice a product; i even like the earthy smell of it. considering henna only deepens your natural hair color, as a black woman, i think it shows that my hair really wasnt a black puff after all ( always had a coopery outer layer but can only tell in the light). my hair did feel stronger after use but i do warn that a pudding consistency may not be enough to rinse it out of hair while it is great for the application process. i believe my next attempt will be to dillute it alot more than before so i could give it the 5 stars it deserves."
3,Henna Powder,"Everything turned out really good besides the face the henna package had a rip in it after i opened the mail packaging and it spilt everywhere, but it worked nicely and looked great :)"
1,Liers,"This is not a pure henna it has had something added to it to alter the shades results. Real pure henna has an orange/red dye molecule in order to get a dark brown dye either ppd a synthetic sulfate or matalic salt must be added, unless they went the organic route and added indigo in the mix but either way this is not pure henna and I will not be buy another product from this seller."
2,Not good henna!,"I'm an African American woman w/4a hair. I applied and left on hair over night, as I usually do! This is some bad henna. No tent, and it dried my hair out so bad!!! I waited a few weeks, deep conditioned weekly, and my hair is still dry. And my curls are gone! I have about 100gs left that im chucking in the trash! Waste of money... Would only get one star but it delivered timely, so can't hate on that..."
5,Happy shopper with Amazon.com,"Greetings, To whom it may concern:I am very delighted with my purchased product and with the delivery-time, too! ""I have only good things to say about my experiences with Amazon."" All the best [at Amazon], from ""Smilely"" in Califonria. (Smile!)"
3,Satin sheets,"Sheets are as described. Never had satin sheets before, didn't realize they are a real pain! Look pretty, but not practical for sleeping on! They won't stay on the bed and every rough spot on your body catches on them."
4,Good resource for preserving the harvest,"""Pickles & Relishes"" ia a good resource for preserving the harvest. It provides information on equipment and safe canning procedures, as well as recipes for preserving a myriad of fruits and vegetables. I like the fact that recipes are often presented for small batches. Relish section is especially nice."
2,Great cover.....,But lacking pictures in the book. Not the best canning book I have and not the worst.Colored pictures would make this book more interesting. I would not really recommend it.
5,Pickles and Relishes,A good book for any pickle and relish lover. Covers more than the basic salt brine and vinigar processing.
3,So-So,"I finished Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction by Jonathan Culler last evening and admittedly was not quite a fan of it. Parts of it I found to be horribly dense and while it's not A Very Easy Introduction much of the book didn't really seem to fit under the topic. Granted, some of you who are more experts in Literary Theory may disagree. However, I did enjoy a good portion of the book that went into the history of the novel, what exactly literary theory is, looked into the canon and how ""reading"" styles have changed over time, and so forth. Perhaps most splendidly it offers a short and concise list of all the big literary theories (i.e. feminism, Marxist, psychoanalysis, deconstruction, etc)."
1,One of the worst books in my library,It's hard to imagine a more painful reading experience. This is a good example of how not to craft expository writing.
4,solid introduction,"Although it is rather frustrating that whoever compiled this cd devoted 10 minutes to not-so-great songs like 'Impact' and 'Belfast' while giving 3 minutes to great songs like 'Halcyon' and 'Are We Here?', this collection is still a great way for Orbital rookies of the sort I was a few months ago to see what Orbital can do. I also believe it is a testament to Orbital's talent that even though many of these songs have been drastically shortened, they still sound great on their own. My only other complaint is that they should have kept the Spawn version of 'Satan' and either Belfast or Funny Break off and put on another more songs from Snivilisation or some of Orbital's remixes, which can be hard to find. Otherwise, a useful starting point for the group's work."
1,Just To Get Your Attention,"I have to say, growing up listening to rap music (2pac) mostly, i never thought that any other type of music would touch me like 2pac's powerful words did. I listened to 2pac alot as a teen. Fighting you know, anger, depression and all that other adolescent stuff which i am still going through, I would just go to my room, be alone and be one with the music. What can I say, I have a very deep appreciation for music that I think most people do not have. I have now grown to like all types of music as long as it moves me. I will end this by saying, Orbital are musical geniuses. They are really what true music is all about. I have a lot of songs by them and each one though different is truly a masterpiece. Get all of their albums"
3,O,"As is stated in other reviews... Orbital is brilliant, but unless you are a completist (as I am) there really isn't much of a reason to pick this up. I wanted this for the single version of ""Halcyon,"" which I did not already own. Unfortunately the mix on here can't even compare to the epic full-length ""Halcyon + On + On,"" which appears on the Orbital 2 album. The one new track, ""Frenetic,"" appears on their ""Rest"" and ""Play"" EPs, issued about the same time as this retrospective. The Kirk Hammett collaboration of ""Satan"" is dreadful. Most of the other tracks here are edited versions of songs taken from their catalogue. I won't even bother to get nitpicky about which omitted songs should have been included on this CD, and vice versa. In general I would give Orbital 5 stars, but I would recommend picking up their other albums instead."
3,"I'm gonna give it an ""eh"".","It's OK. That's about as good of a review as I can give this one. But then, Orbital isn't an easy band to make a ""hits"" CD of."
1,The worst phone I've ever owned,"My experaience with this phone has been terrible!This phone is absolute garbage! Failed miserably within first 3 weeks.Purchased 2; 2nd phone is fine, but 1st is a lemon.I purchased 2 of these phones. 1 works fine (actually a decent phone) the second is crap. Does not hold a charge for more than 26hrs, car charger does not work on phone (but works on other i86's), speaker phone cuts in and out, and the phone drops voice tags (voice activated dialing) at random.Nextel's response: call Motorola and pay $55 to have phone covered under warranty. (Nextel only covers the phone for 15 days -- Day 17 is not covered)"
4,Nextel i860,"This particular phone is very sleek and very nice looking. I have had this phone for over a year now, and still have not had any problems with it. The speaker is really nice and loud, the click to 0pen button is a perfect touch... and over all I am Very pleased with this phone and would highly reccomend it to anyone!"
3,i860 problems,"I purchase a i860 ,i'm a very heavy user of radio and phone,it has some issues that just appear after lots of use,the flip cover,with the spring system and the lock ( close position) gets worn out and doesn't stay close,replace once under warranty and broken again after 2 months.The ring tone,for a expensive phone comes load with lousy ring old tones, and 2 midi ring tones that doesn't worth a penny,the games in it are only crap ""demo"" versions.You have to buy everthing else....The camera are ok compared with other brands.If you have a choice don't buy NEXTEL service (expensive for short features and benefits) ,purchase Motorola RAZOR it's better...."
1,The biggest piece of [...] EVER!,"I can deal with the battery life being bad, but the problem I am having is bad. Seems that most of the time, if I answer a call, or open my phone to make a call, the phone powers down. Today for the first time, it actually did that in the middle of a call. I had called Motorola, and they said that this is a defect in many of the phones. I can get it fixed on my dime, and be without my phone for approx [...]I replaced my i760 which was also plagued by problems, but that is another story. I use many expensive pieces of equipment in my line of work, and have never had any problem (user error, misuse)What irks me the most is that Motorola knows about this and a 4 weeks turnaround time is unacceptable"
3,Great but,Overall this product has meger battery life and lacks Bluetooth. Phone does take a while to power on and off. Might be better off with the i870.
1,Banned from store shelves,"I had this phone for almost 2 weeks (just before my 14 trial period is up)and I have had nothing but extra poor service. During my 5 year marriage w/ Sprint, I had never had so many dropped calls as I had in that two week time frame. This phone should be banned from store shelves. It should be discontinued and never sold again. Everytime this phone is sold, alarms should sound and the Nextel rep should go to jail for false advetisement. Needless to say I was going to cancel my service and rejoin Sprint but a rep convinced me to try the i850 for another 14 day trial period. Well, the phone actually performs very well and so far I have been satisfied. We'll see how the next few days go."
4,Alternative for Alarm,"Before buying this phone I did read the review that it does not have an Alarm. Bummer!!But there is a alternative way to set up reminders:From the main Menu go to Datebook and set up the events.You could use this as an alarm.Disadvantages:The battery life is too short. If I use my Camera the battery discharges very quickly.Overall I like this phone, the camera feature is really cool!"
2,for all the teens AND adults out there,"i have had this phone for about 4 months and at first it was good quality now it is HORRIBLE!you at first see the nice beautiful screen and go YES its a camera phone too. thats what i thought and bought it. even though i have boost mobile (nextel prepaid) someone that i work with has the same problems with the same phone. first the phone is very easy to break mine has a HUGE crack. next its camera is very poor and does not work well at all. it also has the quick flip button whick can be useful at some points but you can not open the phone reguarly or else you will break the hinges. the screen likes to freeze up (both internal and external). all i have had is problems with this phone! Nextel is a great company but this is not one of their better phones. i would reccomend the i850, i830 or i836."
4,This phone is pretty good,I liked this phone it seems to be tough. Takes pretty good pictures. But had ordered it off of Nextels site. They even gave me a code that saved me $50.00. Here it is for you all to share (CL897L) case sensitive. On the shopping cart page. It is like an invoice thing. But I think it is a very good choice. You will enjoy the phone.
2,A Complete Disaster,"This phone is the epitomy of a bad phone. I have had so many problems with it since I got it in 2004. First of all, the front display is always freezing and turning different colors! Then, even though its a camera phone, its not worth it, the camera has horrible colors and very bad graphic quality. Also, even if you have full connection, the speaker still sounds bad! The phone is also terribly sensitive and cracks easily, I know that very well because I had to change the phone about 6 months ago because it had a huge crack and the volume buttons would not work in any way. I hope this helps and just to those who are thinking of buying it, save yourself the trouble."
4,Too long to be a pendant,"In general, it is a good quality pendant. However, it is way too long for me. According to the description, the pendant should be 1 and 1/2 inch long. But it is inaccurate. The pendant is actually 2 inch long, 2 and 1/2 inch if include the loop. I bought it with the 16 inch chain, and the pendant just won't stay above my collar. I like this pendant in general, but it doesn't quite fit my expectation."
1,HOT WHEELS TOTE,"THE OVERALL TOTE IS DESIGNED WELL. IT HAS COMPARTMENTS OF DIFFERENT SIZES TO ACCOMMODATE DIFFERENT SIZED CARS. I THOUGHT THE HANDLE COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LONGER, BUT OVERALL, IT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND MY SON LOVED IT!"
1,Lots of defects from this new company,"I bought this 4 disk set only to discover that disk #1 wouldn't load at all, and the last two episodes on disk four wouldn't play. It was sent back for an exchange. The second set was the same exact thing. After returning that one for a second exchange, the third set was defective in the same manner. Since I tried three copies and they were all defective in the same places, I returned the last one for an refund. This is too bad as I love Mister Peepers.S'more Entertainment needs better quality control. It's hard to believe they aren't aware the of these major problems. Beware!"
2,Recording Quality Ruins Experience,"The 1950's precursor to videotape, Kinescope, was employed recording this show, and that's unfortunate because there are profound soundtrack and image quality issues throughout. It's another reminder how wise Lucy and Desi were to actually film I Love Lucy.. don't expect the quality seen on reruns of that show here. In fact, the sound was completely out of synch throughout every show in the set. To even watch it I had to avoid looking directly at the players' faces as they spoke.Cox's Peepers is a sweet, gentle, amusing character -likeable from the start. When there's physical comedy the show is best, but the unfamiliarity of television makes for some awkward moments for otherwise seasoned actors. I am glad I got a taste of what the show had to offer but the quality is so poor I cannot recommend it, nor will I buy season 2. PS: One particularly bright spot is the addition of cast member Tony Randall whose polish and class way outdistance his costars."
2,One of the second rate fifties shows comes to DVD,"I love fifties television and am looking forward to seeing ""Our Miss Brooks"" and ""The Life Of Riley"" released on DVD some day. Both shows ran for years on radio and television. Mr. Peepers ran for two years and then tanked. I can see why. While Wally Cox was good at delivering his lines, this character was too one dimensional and the show was too slow moving to sustain itself in a long run. Mr. Peepers shoulld have been a secondary character in a bigger show, for example, Mr. Peepers might have been another teacher at Madison High School where Miss Brooks (Eve Arden) worked. Early tv fans will need to see an apisode or two of this but even I couldn't get interested enough to watch all of these."
1,"Thanks, But I'll Pass!","I used to enjoy watching this back in the early 1950s when I was a kid. Unfortunately, I find it offers nothing to interest me today and they might just as well have let it rest in peace."
1,one word for mr. peepers: BORING!,"I LOVE CLASSIC TV LIKE I LOVE LUCY, SGT. BILKO, AND LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, BUT MR. PEEPERS IS SUCH A YAWNER AND WAS VERY POORLY PRODUCED FOR THE TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE AT THE TIME. BORING!!!"
1,Beware of defects!!!,"I purchased this set twice and the first disc was so scratched that it would not play. I exchanged it and the same thing happened again. Someone else complained of same problem. The manufacturer should have better quality control. I will try purchasing at a later date, but I wonder how responsive seller will be. Too bad as I looked forward to seeing this wonderful series once again."
4,I'm so happy these shows were saved.,"I bought this as a gift for my husband, from his wish list, so I didn't know what to expect. The first one, or two of the shows from the series was damaged due to poor storage, and the sound isn't very good. But you can still understand what's going on. After that, the quality improves and the shows are as funny as I remember them. What a treat to have this piece of television history at our disposal. If you're a Baby Boomer and ever watched TV as a kid, this is truly a walk down memory lane. I hadn't remembered that Tony Randall was a regular on the show, and a bit of interesting trivia is that Wally Cox (Mr. Peepers), was close and personal friend of Marlon Brando. And I must add that Marion Lorne is perfect as the dottering school marm. She had perfected her routine to a science and a signature (or perhaps she was just dotty). At any rate, I recommend this set very highly."
3,"Very good toy for dog, keeps them busy!","It is a good toy for dogs & it keeps them occupied for a long time. But be aware that it gets trapped under couches if they push it there and your getting it out all the time. And if you have hardwood floors like I do, it makes a lot of noise, because the ball is hard. I rated the toy based on how much my dog plays with it and likes it and you only get 1 ball, I thought you got all 3."
3,Great Pet Toy,"I purchased the Babble Ball for my 1 year old Jack Russell Terrier. It's a great toy in that she can't destroy it like so many dog toys. My dog loved playing with it and carried it around all the time. The major problem I found was the batteries seemed to come loose, so we were constantly taking it apart to reposition them. Other than that, it's a super toy for energetic dogs."
5,Keeps 'em busy!,"My corgi is obsessed with this ball! She will play with it for hours. The only problem is that this one is small enough to go under the couch, and I have to keep pulling it out for her. I have just ordered the larger size. Made for a great video -- it's great fun to watch her."
2,My 3 year old dog hates this toy.,My 3 year old dog has a collection of toys. I thought he would love this one because it talks. He hates this toy.
1,Yorkies not interested,"I thought my yorkies might play with the 2-3/4 "" babble ball, They both justlooked at it and didn't even try to play with it even though I rolled it andwhen it made noise they just went the other way."
2,"My dog LOVED this, but....","My dog (shih-tzu/pomeranian) went crazy over this toy. Unfortunately, she was able to destroy the very durable-looking plastic. I had to take it away from her because I didn't want her eating plastic chips. Perhaps she's a ""gifted"" chewer, as she can go through even the hardest chew sticks in about 5 minutes or less."
5,Funny,Actually it cheers us up :-) As well as the dogs. We had one before and they generally last along time. The seller was excellent.
3,my dog goes crazy for it,"Got it for my cairn terrier for Christmas. At first he didn't pay any attention to it so I put it up. I must have moved it because it started ""babbling"" and he seemed interested. I rolled it on the floor and he want nuts. He is not an aggressive chewer and has never chewed up any of his stuffed animals but he wants to get this ball between his molars and grind it up. There will be little blue plastic flakes all over. I have double socked it and he chews thru both socks in seconds. I even took some wool pieces and sewed a double thickness around the ball, wool was off in seconds again. He knows where it is at and will stand by the fireplace and look up but I can't let him have it. He is obsessed with it and it would be great if I could get one large enough he could still pick it up but not be able to gnaw on. Will look into getting a larger size when I order something else. Also, it is rather loud but it would be worth it if there wasn't the potential of it harming him."
4,Fun toy but not for senior dogs,"I purchased this for my 17 year old doggie, since she's homebound quite a bit due to her arthritis. I thought this toy would keep her less bored. Unfortunately I didn't realize she's a bit deaf at this point and is unable to hear it. It is what I would imagine a fun ball for a younger dog.The one thing that I would improve about this toy is if they made it with rubber exterior instead of the smooth hard fiberglass-like plastic that makes it susceptible to be broken by younger jaws.When I first got it, before giving it to my dog, I put a ton of rubber bands around it so that it wouldn't be noisy rolling on the wooden floor and also easier for my dog to grab.I will likely give this toy to a younger dog soon. It looks like it'd be incredibly fun."
1,Talking Ball for Dogs,"This item is enough to drive you crazy. It has the strangest sounds coming out of it, very annoying!!!"
1,my dog ignores it,"My 6 yr old Cardigan Welsh Corgi just ignores this thing. The only time it goes off is when he is playing with something else and accidentally bumps it and he just gives it a confused look. It is hard plastic, so he can't play fetch with it. I suppose if you have a more hyper dog that is interested in annoying noises, it would be a great toy, but the only thing in my house playing with this thing is my roomba."
4,you will never convince me this is a placebo,This product works for my knees. It works on my mom's arthritice. Both of those things could be the placebo effect... but it also fixed my dog's arthritic hip. She went from being practically bed ridden to playing on the beach like she hadn't for 6 years. Pretty sure it wasn't a case of faith healing.
1,"Misleading advertising, unresponsive customer support","Do not purchase from The Vitamin Shoppe on Amazon. They use misleading advertising, are unresponsive, will not stand behind their word."
4,Monopod review,The Monopod that I ordered was a gift for my grown son. He told me just what kind and what number so I couldn't miss. The one complaint that I have is that I wanted it here for Christmas but it did not arrive until a day or two after.He is pleased with the product and that makes me pleased.
3,Half way there,"Was looking for an inexpenside monopod for my camcorder. Found this item at a local big box store, the OEM Sunpak Model 620-450bb version.Took the first one back because it was missing the belt clip which is one of the more appealing features. After exchanging for another one, finally had some time to check it out.Major drawback: The top two sections twist lock, BUT the bottom three sections are telescopic, and do not lock. Those 2ft 3in telescoping sections are held in place with protruding bearings.They offer collapsing 'resistance', but do not twist lock.The telescoping sections will only offer significant resistance IF you extend the second/lowest twist section.Cannot be used as a 'walking stick'.....I gave it three stars just because of the belt clip feature, but other than that was disappointed."
2,Almost halfway there,"Agree with other reviewers: save your money on this monopod. The belt clip and the pan/tilt head are the only saving graces. I realized that most of the time with lightweight digital cams don't even need it to balance the 'pod and camera on my belt.Got the Opteka instead - much more solidly built, has a shoulder pouch. I had a Leica table top tripod from years ago and added the head to the pod instead of this one.Mark"
2,Spend more money on something better,"There were cheaper monopods out there. I spent a bit more money expecting more, but I didn't get it. The lowest extension arms don't have locking mechanisms based on tension- you extend them by yanking them out and then cram them back in. It's based on pressure, like a socket wrench. There are spring-loaded ball bearings that snap the arms into place. The upper part of the monopod stays in place because you screw the tubes tight. Basically, if you put much pressure on the pod the bottom arms will fold on you. A major pain. No good for use as a walking stick and inconvenient as a camera mount. It's inexpensive though, but you can do better price-wise."
1,"very disappointed, enough i'm looking to replace it.","Unless your made of money buy a different monopod. The bottom legs do not stay extended under moderate pressure, The whole thing when extended is extremely flimsy."
1,Country Commonplaces,"Once again I was fooled by the title of a book in this series (see ""The Wisdom of Old-Time Television""). I was anticipating a compilation of great lines from country music such as ""I'm So Miserable Without You, It's Almost Like Having You Here"" (song title by Stephen Bishop). But not in this little book. Turn to p. 23 and you get ""Country music springs from the heart of America"" (Tex Ritter), ""Country music belongs to America"" (Bill Monroe) and ""There's more than one kind of country music"" (Pam Tillis). Is this wisdom? Is this entertaining? Is this worth $6.95 plus a $1.85 special surcharge? Well, I'm being a little unfair. There are a few good quotations in this collection, but let me close with the words of Tennessee Ernie Ford on p. 114: ""You can't cheat the public for long."""
2,Spike; let's get back to basics!,"Walker's first book, Working on the Edge, was outstanding. It is written in a manner that holds the reader start to finish. Nights of Ice, was pretty good but started to sink in comparison to the first book. Coming Back Alive, like many of the F/V Walker writes about is a 'sinker'. The one complete sea adventure included is enhanced with page after page of unnecessary information such as childrens names, home towns and high schools attended. Come on Spike. Get back to your original down-home style of writing."
2,disjointed,"While Walker successfully conveys the tension and fatigue of the rescuers and the terror of the rescuees, he is not a friend of language. His technical descriptions, biographical paragraphs and unrelated chapters make this a difficult story to follow. The editors should have shortened this book by about half by cutting information and tightening up the writing. It is a great story but a challenge to read"
3,Mostly Accurate,The book is mostly accurate. Several key errors in the chronological order of some history of the survivors.The cover is completly inaccurate. The H-60's were theplanes used for the rescue yet the book portrays the H-65.
4,A great book,"If you liked ""A Perfect Storm"", you'll like this one. Although the first part where the stage is set and all those involved are introduced went on a bit long, part 2 was incredible. I really got the sensation of what it must have been like being in the water or being aboard a helicopter in those conditions. I would rank this next to ""A Perfect Storm"" for ocean/storm/rescue books and would highly recommend it."
4,A real page turner!,"I made the mistake of reading Mr. Walker's book at bedtime and rolled on my mattress all night. Mr. Walker captured the emotions of the victims and the rescuers and mixed them together nicely.By LD Bergsgaard, Author of While Others Sleep and Next Year in Jerusalem"
2,Not all as was....,I am in this book...not all the facts are exactly like it was....and I agree with the person that said there was more information about the families than was necessary.
4,Riveting Storytelling,"I've been in rough seas, lived in Alaska, and ridden in USCG rescue helicopters, and Spike Walker has nailed it all here. He has taken an obscure event from recent history and painted it with bold strokes, thorough research, and an insider's eye for detail. There were passages in this book that gave me goosebumps, and others that made me miss Alaska. It's a great read, and well deserving of praise. Thanks, Spike!"
5,Could not put this book down!,"This is one of the most mesmerizing books I've read, and definitely one of Spike Walker's best. You will not believe what the fishermen and Coast Guard rescuers go through... tossed about in 50-70 foot seas in leaky survivial suits in 38 degree water in the middle of the night for hours on end. The human will to survive, and the human will to succeed will never be better captured by a more riveting account. Spike Walker's writing captures the right level of detail and he artfully weaves together human emotion and extreme adventure."
4,Coming Back Alive,Excellent book. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Very well written.A good look over the shoulder of the Coast Guard and at the life saving service they provide.
5,"South Park Mex iz Back, Again!","Now, I don't have this Album and I don't have any songs off of the Album, but I sampled it and its pretty damn tight, man! Has the return of SPM's homies Juan Gotti, Rasheed, Low-G, Grimm, Baby Beesh & more! The songs I Must Be High, Hubba Hubba, Bloody War, High Every Day & System are the tightest songs, I must get this and The Chronic, man! Buy & Represent Carlos Coy at his Best, muthaphukka!"
2,This is not SPM's best.,"I was kind of disappointed with this album. While the production has improved somewhat, the lyrics have degraded a bit. While SPM has never been a good lyricist and some of his rhymes can be extremely simple, he has always been very entertaining. His rhymes have weaved humourous tales of drug use with sexual innuendos and crime fantasy. This album seems to have been rushed somewhat. There are times when his flow improves like the pretty good ""All Cot Up"" track. Unlike, his previous albums, he does not enlist much help from Baby Beesh or Grimm with the rhymes or Shadow Ramirez and Happy Perez with the production. If you're a hardcore SPM fan, you will definitely want to cop this album. If not, dont bother. You won't be missing much. I suggest SPM goes back to the drawing board and put some actual effort into his albums."
1,change is good,In light of the recent events surrounding this artist. It is easy to see why Carlos Coy better known as South Park Mexican. Has been unable to achieve the fame he so frequently talks about in his music. With this his Fourth release on his own independent label (Dope house records). This artist has yet to achieve gold let alone platinum status. From start to finish Spm is constantly out shined by his peers. He tends to follow the same format as with all his previous releases. Three words of advise change is good.
3,"It's OK, but there is at least one that I like better...","According to the ""Numismatics Fair Price Guide,"" its prices are very low. I like ""A Guide Book Of United States Coins"" a whole lot better. See my review on that one."
3,"it's a good book for beginners, but not intermediate and exp","It's so so. Doesn't tell you which coins are going to be popular in a few years..necessary for the beginner, but not enough for the expert who wants to know which coins are going to rise in value soon. To improve this you should write a sequel or make a revised edition telling us which coins are valuable in the long run and which are popular coins now. After I read it I learned little. I don't think a lot of people will buy it if they already know what's in the book."
5,Hey! What More Can I say than what I said in my last review?,Gotta put something here... I think I forgot to tell you who I am in my last review on this great little book.
1,"Great movie, but...","I love this movie, but unfortunately, this DVD is not original.Don't waste your money on this copy, and it's will not work on your DVD player."
5,An engaging trivia guide,"Elvis: The #1 Hits: The Secret History Of The Classics by rock music historian Patrick Humphries is an engaging trivia guide that reveals the inspiration and history behind Elvis' most famous rock songs, from the real location of Heartbreak Hotel to mafia involvement in the popular tune ""Can't Help Falling In Love."" Black-and-white and a few color photographs enhance the amazing anecdotes in this excellent giftbook which will be greatly appreciated Elvis fans everywhere."
4,mike kinsella at best,"capn jazz gave him a chance to sing in ""hey ma do i hafta choke on these?"" and i knew he was just not a drummer for his brother. and american football proved that even more. but owen seemed to be just music to sleep to with cheesy lyrics. but this ep is great. the first song is the BEST song he's ever wrote. and everything else is like most of his other owen stuff but with better lyrics and i think the other intruments help out a lot too(yes he's now not the only member of the band). i wish there was more but it's ok because i think he's gonna come out with another full length pretty soon because that's what most people do after they come out with an ep."
4,It's alot bigger than it looks,"Bought one of these for an inverter. Great build quality. Haven't installed yet because I was hoping to put it inline with out mounting it to the car. But it's way too heavy to be left dangling on 6 gauge wire. Giving it 4 stars though, because it is well made, just doesn't work well for my install, since I was hoping to put it inline 3"" from the battery terminal. Back to the drawing board."
5,pure delight,"Impossible to fault this album in any way. The marvelous combination of two great, great stars is just too wonderful."
3,aight cd,"another one of those i want to be a rock star cds. it was aight like i said, but if you really want a good cd get mushroomhead or tool (my fav band)."
3,Really deserves 3 1/2 stars...,"Flaw are a typical nu metal band fans of the genre will enjoy. The singer is the most unique aspect of the band, not really a voice you would expect to find in a band like this. From beginning to end this CD sounds pretty much the same throughout, so if you like track one you'll like track thirteen. It is worth buying if only to hear the singer. In comparison, Flaw sound most similar to Staind."
3,boring,"This isn't too bad but it is quite boring. Its been so long since a band has come out that is so good that it sends chills down my spine. If you want a good nu-metal album buy ""evolve"" from endo. To the guy that said that flaw had more talent than disturbed: Disturbed actually created something instead of being a sheep that is folowing the rest of the flock like so many bands are doing today. PLEASE SOMEONE CREATE SOMETHING!"
2,phew,"If you have a heavy money, And you are super metal fan ,every dayyou 've nothing to do. You must get it.But i'm not a rich boy. when i spend 15 dollars bought this cd, furthermore i realize this is a bad album , I feel really regret. I think if i spend 15 dollars buy a glass of beer.I will really happy."
2,FLAW=mainstream pu*sy rock,"Just another example of the terrible direction that all rock is going. If flaw didnt try to pull off that heavy metal sound, then throw in that crying and whining afterwords it would be OK. So yeah, I guess If you like Staind, you will like this, but listen to Staind's first album and you'll see where the selling out began. Flaw took advantage of this era. I dont consider them a good band. I do however like a few tracks, and I got my moneys worth, but I dont recommend this to anyone looking for good hard rock like they try to pretend that it is."
1,Nu-metal is so good!,"The lyrics are soooooo neat! I love the way the guitar guy looks like he's dead. That's soooo cool!!!! God, I wish I was Flaw! The music stylings are soo inovative and original, I mean, it's so nice to hear bands that don't sound exactally like korn. They employ the use of so many musical inovations, including: Distortion, Bass Guitar, ""Screaming"", and Lead Singers in wifebeaters. Screw whiney intellectual bands like Radiohead and Björk, when I listen to music, I need to hear myself get more stupid. I hate smart stuff! To sum it up in one word: FLAW IS THE GREATEST BAND OF ALL TIME EVER!!!!!!!"
4,Some good NU-Metal,"Flaw's one of the better hard rock acts to come along. The drum work is slow an steady, an fits the music well. The guitarist is decent, occasionally displaying a harsh riff every now an then. The bassist is there....and the vocalist is above average. Showin' off some good vocals an semi-decent screams (but to be compared to Maynard is just laughable).The music itself is good for what it is. Steady rock, with clean vocals. Do not expect metal, but set your expectations to some good rock, an you'll be fine if you purchase this. If you want some real metal, have a listen to Shadows Fall, but if you good rock, then look no further."
4,"close to FLAWless, more like 4.25 stars","i bought this cd on faith after hearing the single ""payback""... i heard good things and this cd lived up to those good things. the guitar ranges from brutally heavy to hauntingly melodic... i really like that in a band. the singer hs a good voice and adds to the bands attack. the only thing i didn't like was that the songs sounded really similar... which leads to a little boredom... but it is still a solid buy. it is the type of cd that you listen to from beginning to end... but try to pick a standout track, i couldn't..."
5,A surprisingly good disc.,"It really annoys me that everyone is so eager to label every new hard band as ""nu-metal,"" because the term has such bad connotations that Flaw doesn't deserve. ""Through the Eyes"" begins with a thunder and ends with a whisper. Chris Volz surprises by singing (no rapping) immediately from the get-go on ""Only the Strong Survive,"" and ending the album with a version of the same song that includes only piano and vocals. I saw these guys open for Sevendust recently, and I was impressed to see how they could convert a lazy crowd into a group of jumpers and moshers within only a few songs (so of course I had to grab the CD). ""Whole"" is another highlight of this disc, which involves intelligent blending of background vocals and Volz' strong voice to supply more of a sonic punch than most bands recently. I was really impressed, and I think most people would be the same. This one stands out in a sea of horrible music. I hope these guys succeed."
4,Flaw - Through The Eyes,"This is an incredible cd. Fans of bands like Killswitch Engage will enjoy it, with tracks 1. Only the Strong, 2. Payback, 3. My Letter, and 13. One More Time being my personal picks."
1,F@GS,"unoriginal,simple,genetic,GARBAGE. They whine wayyyyyyyyyy to much. totality unoriginal, if you want heavy metal and good singing pick up ULTRASPANK or TOOL. Who dare I say it HAVE TALENT. Flaw is for mtv f@gs who think this is metal. How can people say this awesome? This is garbage with NO TALENT"
5,Through the Eyes of Flaw,"The first time I heard FLAW, all I heard was just another band without their own sound. I had the CD, I would listen to one or two songs occasionally, but never gave them much thought. A week after I got the CD, I saw FLAW live with Coal Chamber, and now I listen to the album every day. These guys have some major talent, each member applies his own touch to their unique sound. As the song states, Only the Strong Survive, and this band is sure to be a survivor in the heavy metal community."
5,Best rock cd that will ever come,"This cd is the best i own. Every song is good, the lyrics are amazing, and CHris volz vocals are awesome. ...Each song portrays a point 'THROUGH THE EYES"" of Chris's perspective. Wonderful cd and worth every penny you pay for it."
3,Show me what ya got,"Yeah that's right Flaw. In my opinion IT's has a few. For one I kind of expected it to be heavier. The whole cd takes on kind of a mellow tone. Many of the songs start off heavy but then he starts singing and it's these drawn out lyrics. Kind of whiney almost. I'd rather be yelled at then have some one whining about everything. Just small complaints though, this album is not bad. It's more sit down and hangout stuff than get you pumped to go crush it. Song number two is a good song and a cool video. These guys are pretty cool but no fear factory or slipknot. Hard next time!"
3,good band,go get this i got it when it came out...and just found it today and thought it was awsome....but i tell ya the singer sounds similar to someone maybe you heard of em but that dosent matter these guys are still worth picking up from your local cd store
3,A band with great music,"The CD is an extremely good cd. I recomend this if you like Creed, but alot faster and pumped up version of creed. My Favorite song on the cd is ""Get Up Again"". His voice, and the melodies, form togather so smooth. This cd is a great choice."
3,"Another One of those Albums That Are Not My Cup of tea, BUT",But All In All This Is A Pretty Good CD... I Would Not call It Metal Though. Perhaps A Slightly Edgeier Alternative Record. Good Songs With Mostly Memoriable Choruses... Everyone Should Give this record A Chance...
4,I like all the songs,"Now that i have ventured more into music , i redid my review .. This cd i enjoyed when it came out but found myself not going back to it yet ,, that can change but it hasnt yet . I remember when i was listening to it , it was an interesting cd .//"
5,KICK BUTT!!,"This CD is certainly one of my favorites. All of the tracks have great melody and lyrics. The lyrics are so powerful. Whenever I am in a lost, confused, hurt, or any other mood I can listen to the words (because they have great vocals that are clear and easy to understand what they are saying) and i feel relieved. It is a hard sound with emotion and sincerity."
5,FLAW ...,This is definatly one of the top cds ever made. Flaw goes beyond all of the mindless screaming bands and goes in with his own original sounding volcals. There is not a single bad track that you can find within the cd. As soon as i listened to this cd i was hooked. I could not stop listening to it. Very GOod
5,a fitting description,Evolution is a fitting description to an album that encompases the artistic evolution of Dead or Alive's Steve Coy and Pete Burns. To create a perfect selection of greatest hits for a band that has put so much quality and energy into its music is not easy. The tracks are not in chronological order but are a good selection allowing you appreciate the different range of styles evolving from a raw dance/punk sound with 'What I want' and 'Misty Circles' to the fast paced energetic 'Turn Around and Count 2 Ten' and 'Come Home With Me Baby' to the disco sound of 'Your Sweetness' back to a more modern hi-nrg sound with 'International Thing' and 'Sex Drive'. With Dead or Alive's first domestic sony release in 13 years maybe there is room once again in the pop music scene for vocalist Pete Burns to shock and entertain.
3,Totally 80s,Totally 80s one hit wonder with You Spin Me Round being the signature song of this supposed goth band. Singer Peter Burns was married to a woman for 20 years even though he is bi. His angrogenous look is similar to Boy George. Sex Drive is another good song on this album. I would recommend it to even casual music fans.
1,wrong item,"I purchased this title""Evolution,The Hits"" for only one track;Rebel Rebel by Dead or Alive,when I got the CD it did not have this song apparently there are TWO ""Evolution"" Cds and I certainly did not receive the correct one,very disappointed!"
1,Pete Burns the real life Marilyn Manson,Burns looks more frightening every time a new album cover comes out. SCARY! But anyhow Dead or Alive have one good song and we all know what one that is.
1,You call this music???,"This is not music just noise. How can people listen to this crap and call it music?? No way!! His voice is lame and weak and the lyrics are boring and makes no sense at all. The cover art is horrible and he looks like Dolly Parton. The remixes are lame and I will not buy this for sure. Stay away from it and do not buy it. DOA are nothing but a lame and boring band staying alive on their ONLY HIT ""We Suck and We Know It"""
3,Aussie and Overseas Rock,"Anyone who's interested in getting a taste of 70s and 80s Australian rock, plus a good smattering of international stuff should check out this album. It's a good one to leave in the glovebox of the car. You get two CDs and 33 songs which makes it good value too."
4,"Good, but short",This is a good fun game but I found it fairly easy to beat. All in all this is a good game and I recomend you rent or buy it soon.
2,FOUR HOURS LONG - RENT do not buy,"I bought this game and four hours later after beating it with ALL player characters returned it and bought Fellowship of the Ring.TT is a very good game, perhaps one of the best looking games on the PS2. The environments are rich and look like the movie.The story flow is weird to say the least. It bounces back and forth between movie and game.The character models are ok. The enemies are terrific but the player characters are horrible especially Gimli.Overall, a good game but WAY TOO SHORT/ I finished it in 4 hours. Thats about 10 bucks an hour. So I took it back and bought Fellowship of the Ring which seems to be much bigger.Rent this game. Finish it. Dont waste your money on purchasing it."
2,Not challenging for a 10 year old.,"Even though this game is rated Teen, my 10 year old beat all levels with all chacters in two days. He was given the game by an 11 year old friend that had beaten it quickly, as well. Unless you are a huge fan of the movie, your best bet would be to rent the game for a few days."
1,[not as good as i'd hoped],"With all the hype surrounding this game for the last few months , I was expecting a much better efort from EA .Probably my biggest gripe is the overuse of video clips from the movie between levels . Yeah it's cool when it morphs into animation gameplay but it stikes me as being a case of the developers being too lazy to animate sequences and taking the easy way out by just throwing in clips from the movie . The facial animation on the characters looks horrible . The gameplay is slash & hack 101 and it's a VERY short game . If you're looking for something that stays true to Tolkien's work , pick up the Vivendi ""Fellowship of the Ring"" which was obviously a labor of love by Tolkien Fans ."
1,the two towers sucks,"I hate lord of the rings the two towers it sucks. every one that likes the movies,don't play this game the people in the game have ugly faces,bad attacks,and the levels you go is even worse. I can't see what I'm doing, and frodo looks ugly."
2,Disappointing ...,"First, the title isn't very fitting--however ""Fellowship of the ring"" was already taken, so I guess they had to pick something.The game starts out where the movie ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" starts out, with the big battle scene against Sauron and his forces. Then it just skips from battle to battle with very little else. Yes, the graphics looks good, and the clips from the movie is neat as well, but ... I expected more of an adventure. Instead I got just another ordinary fighting game."
2,WHAT?????,"I dont know what everyone is talking about. This game [stinks]! The graphics are horrible, there are only 3 characters to choose from and it doesn't even follow the movie. The only reason I'm giving this game 2 stars is because I like the LOTR books and movies so much....No, I'm just kidding, it's an awesome game. Go out and buy it right now if you haven't already."
1,BAD,I love lord of the rings i red the books (all of them from the hobbit to the retern of the king) but if you compare it to the felloship its bad. its the same thing in every levle you fight and that gets borning after a wile. DON'T PLAY THIS GAME UNTIL YOU PLAY THE FELLOSHIP its better
4,EA SPORT,"I only have to say.....The EA Sport Games usually are really boring, and the graph quality is low, I hope that they make a difference with this game."
4,Fun game,"This game is way fun! It has good action and easy combos, it tends to get harder towards the end but I love a challange so it was cool. This game isn't hard after you get all tho moves and attacks. It gets easier when you get the instant kill moves. This game should be two players I think, that is my only complaint about it."
5,Stunningly Entertaining,"I'm not going to claim that the game is the best ever, but it has to be close... darn close. Thoroughly engaging, beautiful graphics, great interviews with the actors who provided the voices, nice access menu, good controls. I love the way that the game has been fluidly integrated into the known story without busting possibility or creating situations that 'could never be'. The fact that the game runs through events in the Fellowship too is neat and satisfying. I loved fighting the Nazgul at Weathertop.It isn't perfect, but gripes - like the Coup d'Grace Kill button down on the R2 button is a bit of a stretch to include in a Combo - are petty compared to the satisfaction of playing the game. Running around firing off arrows like a sub-machine gun with Legolas or slicing Uruk-Hai with a sword like it was second nature... fantastic stuff that can't be recommended enough.Thoroughly looking forward to The Two Towers and tempted to buy the Fellowship as well."
2,Total Let-down,"The only reason I gave this game more than one star is the graphics, which are pretty decent. However, the rest of the game is another story. First off it is amazingly short, it took me one day to beat it, (and I was only playing it when the movie I was watching was on commercial). It consists of 12 ""levels"" where the only objective is to kill orcs, you cannot adjust your camera angle (which leads to very awkward battling), and you have to memorise complicated ""moves"" (for instance one was XXO^^R2) to even have a chance in Helm's Deep, They do let you change characters, however Aaragon is the only useful one (I tried the other 2, but then you have to memorise even more ridiculous moves)To sum it all up, it is basicly short clips of the movie, where they let you play in a few scenes. The total game-play is 10 hours MAX I beat it in 6..I was truly disappointed in this game. However, it is worthy of renting for fans of the movie."
3,Come on NOW,"Come on now wat r u guys businessmen and marketers, i mean this game was good but it wasn't all that it was cracked up to be, it is only ONE PLAYER and not even my 22 year old brother liked it....he's a mega lord of the rings fan, he's waiting for the Return of the King game, it'll be definitely better than this 1 . The Two Towers movie was kinda dragging and the game was pretty lousy,I mean its a piece of junk if u cant even use the main character Frodo."
2,Not what I expected,"I wish that I had checked reviews before buying this game. The previous reviewer even addressed my problem with the game: nothing but fighting. I was expecting a game a little bit closer to the whole Lord of The Rings setting of mystery, excitement, journeys and so on. Instead, it just moves you from one huge fight to another. It explains the story but you don't have a say in it or really even participate except to fight Orcs. The graphics and sound were both amazing but during the fights, you may have upwards of 20 badguys around you and it is almost impossible to see your own character. If you like a game without mental challenge or excerise and enjoy a game where no skill is required, try this one. It is an excellent game for it's purpose. The action was fun and riveting, but don't let yourself be fooled as to what this is. I am not sorry I bought this game by any means, I just wish I'd looked at these reviews earlier."
5,The BEST sword-play game ever!,"This game is simply awsome! I loved having the opportunity to slash through hordes of orcs. Some of the combo moves were difficult to remember, but once learned were great to use. The designers hit a homerun with Aragorn's rising attack upgrade. And playing as Legolas with those two knives was like fighting with a ninja. It would have been cool if they had added the ability to jump or climb, but it realy wasn't needed in this game. Overall, this is a must have game for any big fan of the books or movies."
2,button mashing disappointment,"very little strategy involved.battling orcs and uruk'hai is pretty much mashing the buttons as fast, and for as long as you can.the cut scenes and integration into the movie/storyline itself is neat, but changing the outcome would have been more fun (e.g. racing to boromir's help as he sounds his horn- what if you got there in time to rescue him and the halflings?)one positive aspect to the game is the character development, earning experience points, advancing levels and skill is cool"
1,What the ... where they thinking?,"I was hoping for a game that ADDS to the movie, instead I GOT the movie, full with behind the scenes footage! Argg, what a waste of money. It repeats the ENTIRE movie. There is so much time wasted on the movie clips and 1/1000th of that is actual game play. Why make a game at all? There could have been so much more to it, if they took the time."
3,there are much better games out there,"Graphics really aren't that and the game gets really hard in the last levels. The first time you fight a boss, you'll definatly lose because there is a certain techinique in beating them and the first time, you'll have no idea what to do. The powering up system is very hard to get a lot and the moves aren't very helpful. short. If you haven't seen both the movies, you'll have no idea what's going on and it will look very stupid. You get extras from getting far and that is good. Seems cheesy and legolas looks nothing like orlando bloom."
4,good game,if you have played dynasty warriors 2 almost same better graphics harder play all in all good game
1,Not What I Expected,"This game isn't terrible, but it's not what I expected it to be. Being an LOTR fan I had to purchse the game. However, most of the gameplay is hacking and slashing, and I expected the LOTR game to be similar to the quest described by J.R.R. Tolkien in his works. In addition the camera angles are poor, which add to the confustion when you're surrounded. Add to that the fact that there are a large number of video clips from the first movie. I don't mind the movie, however there seems to be more movie clips then gameplay, and that can get annoying. I haven't finished the game, but a friend of mine who did said it makes for a very short gameplay. If you want to experience it, then my suggestion is to rent."
2,Nasty gameses. Blowses and [stinkses] it does.,"Am I the only one in the world who thought that this game blowed? (blew? whatever). I was expecting something a little more than a straight fighting game, which is what this is. You fight and fight and fight and fight and fight and fight. No plot. No development. Large fight scenes are dark and confusing. Worth a rent, but I was not impressed."
5,As Real As it Gets!,"I won't waste time telling you the specifics of how to play. I just want to say that this game makes you feel like you are actually in the movie! I am a huge LOTR fan, and this game is completely awesome! If you are not a hardcare gamer, you can play it on the easy level and you wont get too frustrated and give up. Not a big learning curve on this game either. For more of a challange, there are normal and hard levels also. I love how you can go back and play each segment with all the different characters. The game starts with the prologue in the first movie, and proceeds from there with movie clips woven into the game. You even get to fight as Isildur in the opening scene and watch him cut the ring from Sauron's hand. Gameplay is also excellent on its own merits, and so it's not just another gimmick based on the movie. I can't believe I waited so long to buy it... this is a *must own*!!!!"
5,TOTALY AWSOME,this game is deffinetly one of the best games I've played since Vice City.It is cool because It is the movie but you play inbetween.It also summerises the first one and you can battle with thousands of people.IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED IT BUY IT NOW! IT IS TOTTALY ...AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers is brilliant.,"This game looks and plays absolutely brilliant. Be forwarned, though, it's a tough one but well worth playing through. There's wave after wave of battles with one enemy after another from The Lord of the Rings universe. Yet, what makes this game truly shine is that you get experience points that you can use to get new fighting moves and weapons. Working up the levels in your characters has never been more fun. There's even interviews with key people from the movie for you to see, even scenes from the new movie. JRR Tolkien would be proud if he were still here to see the fine job that they've did making his book come alive in this game.If you're a Lord of the Rings fan, or if you just love the thrill of the fight in games such as this, you owe it to yourself to check out The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers. It's without a doubt the best looking game I've seen on the PS2 thus far."
3,Too Limited,"This is a cool game visually, but it's way too short and it's only one player. I was told that this game was considered the ""heir apparent"" of Golden Axe, but Golden Axe had up to 3 players. That's what Two Towers should have done; made a longer multiplaer game. It's too bad, becasue it is an otherwise cool game."
4,Awsome!!!,If any of you liked the movies or the books youll love this game you can play as Aragorn Gimli or my number one fav Legolas. Each person has different power ups which makes the game very fun. It is a little hard but once you get the hang of it it is awsome! my 9 year old brother liked it I (12) liked it and even my dad liked it it is for everyone.
4,This is soooo awsome,"In one word, this game is awsome. Great graphics, the academy award soundtrack from the movie is in this, controls really good, the movie-geme footage is perfect and you will have a lot of fun playing. My only complaints are the lack of multplayer play, frustrating at places, and almost busting my left analog stick on my controller."
4,good. in the middle of playing it,"i love how they use the movie and then it goes to the game i think that is soo kool. they actually had the actors from the movie this time. that was great, really felt like were there. graphics were good, could be better, the faces of the charcters are somewhat fuzzy. i didnt like how they went back to the first one nd made me do moria again. but it was alot diff in this one. this game is VERY challenging. because u cant save in the middle. if u die u have to do the whole level over. gets a bit frustrating. it came ok packaged it wasnt in an actual case more like a paper made for floppys but the game was fine.would highly recommend this seller.very fast delivery"
2,This is a horrible game,This is one bad game! It is a shame that it is the official game because it is that bad. I rated it a 2 star because it at least had ok graphics. You have to be a very loyal fan of the books to play this game (If you own a Xbox buy the Xbox one it is a lot better)
5,THE BEST!,THIS GAME IS THE BEST!YOU MUST GET IT!GRAPHICS:10GAME PLAY:10CONTROLS:10THIS GAME IS SO COOL YOU WON'T STOP PLAYING IT!
2,Extremely BAD Game,"This game [is bad]. Its straight forward no thinking type of game. You just go right into battle, very little story and very poor gameplay. The controls get hard every now and then making it even harder. The game itself would be nice if you had more freedom. Some cool features like the level up and new moves are cool, but overall the game is seriously lacking. You can only go forward and fight hordes of monsters. Its a pure hack and slash game with a 3D twist. Similar to Legion: Legend of Excalibur but with better graphics and less freedom.I bought this game, finished it in less than a week and sold it. If you are a Lord of the Rings fan, you have to be a REALLY HARDCORE LORD OF THE RINGS FAN! I am and I was totally unimpressed. Unless you like 3D hack and slash with no brains, steer clear."
4,Great,This game is worth the money I really liked it although I thought it just a tad too easy but that was with the cheat codes I don't think I could've beat it in the same way without them. I thought the last level was easier then some others and the hardest levels were the timed ones.
5,This is the best game I ever played.,"I got Lord of the Rings the towers a day ago, and it rocks. I have never had so much fun in my life. You get to be Legolas, Arrogon, and Gimli. All of them are good, and you also get to be the king on the first level but the levels are kind of hard and the last three levels are very hard, but this is really the best game I have ever played.This is a great game for teen's. It is worth every penny."
4,Very Cool,"Very cool game. very fun. my one problem with it (being a fan of the movie) was that Merry Pippin and Sam didn't come along. It didn't make sense to me. Other than that, excellent. great graphics."
3,I hate it!,It is not PC Playable! But it is fun to play. It is stupid that people are making XBox games and gamecube games and not PC!
2,"An excellent movie promotion, a poor game","I read the wonderful reviews. I loved the movie and the book. I bought the game. I traded the game in.I then read the reviews again, and I still don't understand what people see in this game. Maybe it's just a love of J.R.R Tolkein's characters. Here's what I got out of the game: You see a clip from the movie, then you act out a short battle sequence. You repeat this again and again.There is no depth!Maybe I am just too concerned with gameplay - the graphics are excellent and the storyline (following the movie) is also excellent. Here's my problem: If I wanted to watch the movie, I'd watch the movie, ...Everyone seems to like this game, so you might too, but I still don't get it."
3,"Fun for awhile, but too short and repetitive",This game is very fun to watch and the graphics are great. I found it to be too easy and short. I beat the game in only a few days playing very casually. I didn't bother with the bonus levels because they were very stupid and repetitive. Definately a great game to rent because you can beat it in the few days you have rented it.
4,"Pretty cool, too short",Realy cool gamegood action seaquencesincludes 1st and 2nd movie partsEasy to controltoo short only like 15 levelsgood graphics
3,To much stuff to repeat but still a good game,Every time I died on some boss I would always have to start back over in the very beginning of a very long level where it takes 10 or 15 minutes to get back to the spot I was just in because i died. I did like it because there was alot of fighting and good follow up on the movie. I wish it had to do more with the Two Towers than with the Fellowship
4,Best game ever!,"this is the best game ever. you can be Legolas,Arogon,or Gimli.there are over 10 levels.there are many cool special moves you can do.get this there is a secret character and level. me and my brother have hours of fun. i think this game is awsome. @"
1,Piece Of Crap,"This is the [worst game] i have ever played. the game is short, boring, and Gimli looks like my ex-girlfriend. Plus it reminds me of those wanna-be RPG games that are [bad] themselves, so buy the movie and play games like Final Fantasy VII."
2,the bad review,im not a big fan of lord of the rings like my friends are but idecided to buy the video game any ways because it sounded cool.it was fun for the first few days but then it got kinda boring.my advice to you is do not buy this video game.
1,No balrog,You do not get to fight the balrog in this game. I can't express my dissipointment for this since the Balrog was my favorite monster in the movie.
4,This Game Is Awsome,"Hi. I just got this game and I love it! The battle style, graphics, sound and music are amazing. Some of my friends say that the game gets very manotonus, so I guess you really have to like killing things to stay interested. The only downside to this game(for me at least) is that I can't seem to get anywhere without the restore health code(hold L1, L2, R1, R2, then press triangle, down, X, up). I guess im just not that good, but the enemies do a lot of damage! Well anyway, I love it and highly reccomend it to anyone who likes constant killing games."
4,BEST GAME SINCE TIMESPLTTERS 2 AND HALO,"i have lord of the rings the two towers and it is really fun. there are the COOLEST moves like goblin bane and you can play as aragorn, legolas, or gimli, each with there own moves. i love the game and if you love action and sword play, then get this game!"
4,Awesome game!,"This game is awesome. I got this for x-mas, oh my god, the graphics are so cool! This is definetlely one of my favorite games for PS2, and it should be yours also."
4,Lord of the Rings Two Towers,Controls are easy to master but does not detract from the game. Vitualy stunning and the movie clips flow into the game seamlesly. Game play is excellent. A must for all LOTR fans.
3,Mediocre... VERY mediocre,"The first time I played this game I was captivated. Fighting through the first two movies was blowing my mind. However, I had rented it, and so when my friend got it for Christmas, I borrowed it to finish my game (I hadn't beaten the last level). My playing had died, so I started over. Well, replay value is horrible. I found myself being so bored that I was studying the game. While doing so, I realized: the graphics really aren't very good. I found the play control to be bulky and stubborn. However, this game blows Fellowship straight out of the water. The voices of this game are good, as are the inclusion of decent weaponry. I wouldn't spend the money to buy this because I got past Breached Wall of Helm's Deep (the next-to-last level) in only 2 hours of game play the FIRST time around... with all 3 characters. Rent it, play it, get it out of your system."
4,Great Game!!,Lord Of The Rings:The Two Towers is a great game and really fun to play! The characters look so much like the actors in the first movie. It's really fun but it doesn't follow the book at all. All you do is fight and then once you beat a mission you watch a small part of the movie. So you dont really go looking for mordor you just fight. The graphics are great as well as the sound effects and the sweet attacks. All in all The Two Towers is a great game.***Note to Parents: Even though this game is rated teen there is no blood shown ever. So if you dont want your kid seeing blood squirt out of someone than this is a great combat game.***
5,frafort,The game overall is fantastic. The graphics and visual effects are outstanding. Going from one level to another is pretty good. The mixing of different scenes from the movie into the game itself is excellent. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone. I rate this game as a definite 5 stars game to have for your stock or collection of other PS2 games that you have.
5,WOW THIS IS THE 2 BEST,THE RETURN OF THE KING IS BETTER THEN THIS BUT O WELL THIS IS SOOO MUCH FUN IS HARD THE FIRST TIME YOU GO THROUGH IT IT TOULK ME 7 MOUTHS TO BEAT IT THE BREECH WALL IS THE HARDEST I HAVE A HINT THAT WILL HELP U WILL THE LAST LEAVEL IN THE GAME GO TO GAMEWINNERS.COM THEY GIVE U GREAT HINTS ON HOW TO BEAT THE GAME AND THEY GIVE U CHEATS BUY THE TWO TOWERS BUY THE RETURN OF THE KING :)
4,good but not great,"first of all this is a great game if you like killing orcs and goblins, good grapics,and scences from the Lord of the Rings movie.If you like long levels, and more to levels than just killing creatures this is not your game. You can choose to play as Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli,and Isildur (in the first level). you can buy upgrades for the characters, but the game play is bad. The good grapices hardly make up for the short levels,and many cut scenes.You could probly beat this game in a few days. Over all this game deserves 3 stars"
1,what is this.......,wat were they thinking when they made this game i would have more fun watching the clothes in a laundry machine go up and down
3,Rent it first,"My son asked for this game for Christmas. Knowing the popularity of LOTR, I ordered it quickly. He rented the game and finished it in one weekend. He told me to take it off his Christmas list meanwhile the game arrived the next day."
3,"Rent, Don't Buy!!",The game has some excellent graphics and fun game play but it was horribly short. I was able to beat it in about 3 and a half hours. I was also hoping it would be more like the movie and introduce you to some of the new charecters like golem and the tree guy. The cinematics were really cool. They fade from the film to CG. It is a great rental but a wast of [money].
4,Compare the two games,"Gamers, I'd like your help. I don't have either of the two LOTR games yet and want to know which one you recommend. I notice neither game provides screen shots to compare, so lacking that,if anyone has played both games, let me know which one has the better graphics (my wife will want Aragorn to look like Vigo). Thanks for your help!"
1,Sauron's best,"This game is so bad that it looks like Sauron itself was the programer, no twist to the story, super hard levels, (even on easy setting), looks good but better watch the movie, and the rewards are not worth the effort to finish it, stay away from this Ork."
4,HARD BUT COOL,This is the coolest Lord of the Rings game ever. The game play is the bomb. The grafics are also the bomb. But there are tons of movies that you have to watch because it doesn't let you skip them. It is the funest fighting game you'll ever play in your life. You can also buy all these different moves you can make the people to do. But the bad thing is its realy hard to beat without cheats. PEACE OUT!
2,Two Towers,"It wasn't that good at all. Constantly the same fighting all the time. It doesn't even follow the Two Towers story line! it follows Fellowship of the Ring!It would have been better if there was a two player mode, and a little more to it."
5,"A 5-Star, Two Thumbs Up, Phenominal Game","Looking for a good PS2 or X-Box game. ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is it! You play as Aragorn the ranger, Legolas the Elf, or Gimli the dwarf. This game is loaded with action and adventure. You fight Orc, Uruk-hai, and goblins. Then you can fight the bosses of levels: Ringwraiths, Lurtz, the Watcher, Saruman, and even the Wargs from The Two Towers movie. There are scenes from the two movies, interviews with Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and John Rhys-Davies. This is a must get adventure for all action lovers. Rated Teen for Violence and Blood."
5,One of the Best Games Ever,"This game is by far, one of the best games I have ever played. It is a great fighting game. The graphics are great, as well as the gameplay. It is extremely hard which makes it even more addicting. I haven't been able to put the game down since I bought it. It is a must have."
3,Eh....,"Lord of the Rings: The Twin Towers was set up in good fashion however, fell short of my expectations. There is much fun in the beginning but, it seems to get old and repetative quickly. You seem to be running around with the weapon each character has and doing combo moves or when you make it to a boss, having to fight him with the same 1 or 2 moves over and over until he dies. My real frustration is not being able to play as Gandalf. Although he does fight along side you every now and again. If your looking to pass the time this is a good buy, if you want to be sucked in to a game, look toward Vice City."
4,How to tackle circumstances and shake the life out of them rather than having circumstances shake the life out of you.,"This collection of witticisms by people who have met old age full front and made it an asset will make you smile, reflect and ponder your rating on the aging scale. While proper living can delay the onset of physical aging, it cannot be put off forever. Fortunately, the aging of the mind is much easier to delay and a lot of that is due to having the right attitude. By maintaining a defiant position regarding aging and never losing a sense of wonder and adventure, it is possible to live right up to the very point at which you die. Which is contrasted to those who take decades to die in the physical sense after having lost their spirit. Despite their vast differences in temperament and beliefs, the people quoted in this book share one strong characteristic, you tackle circumstances and shake the life out of them rather than having circumstances shake the life out of you."
2,As Described . . . Just . . . Not for Me,"The description/explanation of the book is correct. It IS a book of quotes by famous people on the topic of growing old, but I found it to be boring after a very short read. After having it for only one day, I donated it to a local hospital."
4,great soundtrack!,"I am a really big fan of the olsen twins. i just love their show so little time. so when my mom bought me the soundtrack i lisened to it over and over again. it has all of the great songs from the show but it is missing a few.for the crazy people out there who think the olsens have bad voices(not me), this C-D has no songs sung by them, they are all sung by different bands. all of the tunes are upbeat and the can really get you dancing and singing. my family likes it because it has no bad language and the songs appeal to just about anyone! if you are a mary-kate and ashley fan this C-D is an absolute must! a great addition to your C-D collection."
2,My cat looked at it for 2 seconds...,"...then walked away.I bought this based on the only review, which was positive...my mistake.I also had no idea of the size and weight, since there were no specs or pictures with a cat.The problems are: 1) the size and, 2) the weight. The base is approx. 6 x 6 inches and the spring/bob thing is 10 inches but it sags to the side...not strong enough to stand straight. The entire toy weighs so little [a couple of ounces, tops] that it will not stay put if a cat tries to scratch the base.It might be OK for a little kitten, but not for my 10 lb. adult, who will play with just about anything...except this...;-(I'll buy something more substantial next."
2,Best for very little kittens,This product is fine for kittens but not for cats. The issue is kittens grow up so it becomes worthless. However it's cheap enough you can buy it while they're little.Problem with cats:Big cats knock this over and it sits on the ground sideways. It isn't fun for them if they cant swat it around so they ignore it. The spring popped out of mine as well.
1,Only $5 but Still Not Worth It,"I was very disappointed to find this toy sagged to the side. The spring has no ""spring"" to it. It just flops there.I was surprised at how small this is. If your cat is not a small kitten she/he will knock it over every time they try to play with it.But of course, that doesn't really matter due to the ""flop"" because my cat couldn't care less about it. I've tried and tried to interest her in it by moving it myself, but the way it just flops around just makes it boring to her.I have had other versions of this toy in the past that kittys love so if you find one elsewhere for a decent price it is worth a try."
1,Too short/ base not weighted well enough to stand up if hit hard,"This cat toy, and those like it, have the same failing. They are too short for an adult cat to play with. When a cat of 10-15 lbs plays with a toy they expect to be able to stand and stretch at full length and hit hard with their paws. These toys---and I fault the manufacturers who have to know this but keep turning them out---are flimsy, too short, and are knocked over even by quite young cats. Don't waste your money. Save up instead and get the best ""cat condo"" or ""cat tower"" you can afford, those give cats, even full grown cats, the best exercise, use of climbing skills, scratching posts they can actually use because they're tall enough, hiding places and all the things cats seem to want and need in a toy/ exercise gym."
2,Basic cat toy,Loved the colors in the picture but the one I got was an ugly combo. I realize that they say colors vary in the ad but I didn't like what we got. Also the packaging was poor so the wire was bent. Cat liked it for a while though until he got to be bigger than it was lol.
4,Kookamunga Kitty Swat Exerciser,My kitty loves it and she can play with it on her own without my assistance.
3,Good,Good shipping time.......though book was very detail oriented and took some time to decipher. Would have preferred a more to-the-point version.
3,Tons of good info.,If you want to know about palm reading then get this. I just find this subject Boring!
5,Best Mousse Around!!!,"This is the best mousse I have ever used. Have been using this product for years / tried others when I didn't order Fantasia... and was always disappointed. Try for yourself, you will agree. Truly Fantastic!!"
4,George is back!,"One thing to say: George is back! He ahs been out of the music scene for a while while just recording live cds but he is definitly back to his old form with this new CD. His first three singles have hit near the top of the charts. ""Living and Living Well"" went all the way to #1 and still is up there. This CD is his best since ""Carrying your Love with Me"". The title track just shows how George is keeping up to date with todays' music scene as well as sticking to his roots. Mr.Strait has now reclaimed his position as the top country artist with this newest CD! Definitly not a album to be missed!"
3,Pretty Decent Album for a Guy Who Just Likes to put out Albums,"I mean he has an album out almost every year and doesn't have much to show for it. Oh well, I guess just like almost every other country artist, it's easy to put out an annual album when you don't write any of the music. Anyway, I like the openeing 3 songs which are kind of rockish and R&Bish. The first song is a good opener and has fairly good harmonies. Run is good as well and uses a drum machine for the verses which is a little rare in country. Stars on the water is fine and it has some digital voicing that works well. After the 1st three tracks I lose interest but it's a nice start. Strait has a lot of good stuff but his albums are hard to listen to."
1,He needs a new road,"George hurrys out the same album every year. Same songs, different titles. Talk about a total lack of artistic creativity. He has become a misrepresentation of what a natural country musician is."
5,Not Just Your Typical Strait!,"This is probably the best thing he's done since Carrying Your Love and Blue Clear Sky, which I still think are the two best albums he (or any other country performer) has ever done. This album has a little bit of a different sound than most of his others with several outstanding tracks and well worth the bucks to add to your collection, especially if you're a Strait fan. While not all the songs will please everyone, I think there is something here that everyone can enjoy."
3,1single isn't like the others....,"I bought this CD (my first G. Strait) for ""baby run"". This is a wonderful song. Unfortunately the other songs don't have these same slightly pop feel, if you will. So trust, the rest are pure country. There are a few others, talking about love and how love enhances one's life, even if the person doesn't stay forever. ""The Road Less Traveled"" is a classic song-destined to be another ""The Dance"" if given enough airplay. There are also the typical rowdy, country boy songs included. A couple in there remind me a little of his ""ocean front property"" days. A nice CD."
4,Simplify your Green River 6 experience,"It is pretty much what you would expect when buying a footprint for a tent. The benefit is that it fits the footprint of the Green River 6 tent perfectly, including fasteners to hold it in the correct position. Also, since it is designed for the Green River 6, there is no need to fold under the edges to prevent funneling rainwater. Be aware that this footprint does NOT include the vestibule of the Green River 6 tent. I believe this is actually a benefit as it would prevent water that might enter the vestibule (during a heavy rain, for example) from funneling back towards the tent. My one ""con"" for this footprint is that it seems rather lightweight. While I have no reason to believe it isn't strong, I do worry that a sharp rock or stick might poke right through."
2,We were disappointed,We own the Green River 4 and footprint and upgraded to the 6 this year. This footprint did not fit at all. It was too wide and not nearly long enough. Definitely nothing like the way the green river 4 tent and footprint fit together.
4,Exhaust Fan Grill,"This product is just what I was looking for. It came with a bolt (which I didn't need), but not a nut (which I did need). I did not purchase it for myself and the individual who has it is pleased. I could not find anything locally to meet our needs, so overall it gets two thumbs up!!"
5,Fantastic Christian Band!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love Salvador!!! They have such a flavor to their music. It can energize you with songs like ""Like David Danced"" and soothe your soul with songs like, ""Crucified with Christ"" BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
4,A contagious album,"The first time I heard ""Lord I Come Before You"", I thought, ""hmm, not bad"" but once I heard the rest of the songs, I was hooked. I worked at a Christian music station and once I started playing Salvador I started getting more and more requests for it. ""David Danced"" is great,a new twist on a song we all sang in Sunday School or VBS! My friend who teaches aroebics uses some of these songs for her classes, and there are also some thoughtful, beautiful songs as well. Also, some is in spanish - a great gift for the multi-lingual!"
3,Full Blast is not loud enough,"I bought this item (and matching counter-part) to replace original beep-beep horn on Honda Insight. While it sounds as a grown-up now, it is not loud enough to wake up occasional sleep-driver. The price is right, but declared 116db (that was the most I could find in this category) is, probably, not there by far. I would recommend this to someone who can live with moderate loudness and can place this horns outside the car (underneath bumper) facing forward."
2,quiet horn,"I ordered this as a replacement horn. The ad mentioned that it was extra loud. It was easy to hook up, but when I tried to honk it, a quiet peep peep came out. It certainly was not extra loud and I doubt if it is loud enough to warn anyone that I honk at. The honking probably cannot be heard by another driver with his windows rolled up. This is not the horn that I wanted. It is quieter than the original."
3,not as loud as I hoped...,"I bought two, one is the low tone and one is the high tone. Claimed to be, or called ""Extra Loud"" they are not half as loud, or about half as loud, as the horns in my '84 Caprice. Those horns in the older sedans were/are a great loud horn(s) and if I had it to over again I would just visit a local auto salvage shop and ask for the horns from an older GM or Ford or something. (If you do this be sure they test them for you first)I was replacing the horns in my '98 Cherokee (which sounded chinsy) and was a little disappointed in these."
4,Made in the USA,"There was a stamp on the stock horn indicating 110dB output, and this horn is definitely louder than the old horn, mounted in the front bumper. The price was right compared to $50 for an OEM horn. In addition, this horn was Made in the USA.There were other horns available with 120dB output, but I found this acceptable and not overbearing when the horn sounds turning on the alarm. Only 4 out of 5 stars because nothing can match a good quality air horn."
4,Good job for the price,"Obviously these headphones are not like the Bose ones, but they do a good job. They work in three ways:- They fit closely to the ears, cutting out high frequencies- They suppress mid-low frequencies actively- They raise the mid/low frequency spectrum of the music.Being aimed at ""mechanical noise"", they get rid of most of the server-fan noise in my office and reduce also a bit talking/typing (talking becomes inaudiable with medium-level music).The main con is that the increased mid/low frequencies can get annoying - so I simply adjust the equalizer of my mp3 player. The joint that make them foldable might get annoying, depending on how you wear them and on how mych cushioning is provided by your hair. Also for some people the leather cushioning might get a bit hot on the ears, but they only ""fit on"" and don't ""hug"" the ears.Overall the music quality is ok, and they're a good investment if you don't look for perfection or you don't want to spend >$100."
2,Very Disappointing,"I got this book out of the library, along with ""Bouquets: A Year of Flowers for the Bride"" and the Knot book, and I would have to say, this was by far the least useful. For one thing, there was nothing simple about it-- the arrangements either involved mountains of flowers, or varieties of orchids I had never seen anywhere else, or arrangements that were closer to balancing acts. There is one picture that seemed to have literally hundreds of calla lillies around a doorway. Come on!Compared to the Bouquets book, which offered a lot of variety and was pretty creative, this just seemed like a lot of lilies & orchids & roses, and compared to the Knot book, it wasn't as practical, cost effective, or even very descriptive. I am not a fan of the Knot website, but surprisingly, I found their flower book the most informative. I would recommend either book over this one."
3,Wedding Flowers Made Simple: Over 80 Glorious Floral Designs for That Special Day,The photography in the book was beautiful but the bouquets were not practical for most brides. I did like that flowers were identified with amounts needed.
3,Wedding Flowers Made Simple:Over 80 Glorious Floral Designs for That Special Day,This book give more inspiration...
5,Wonderful product - exceeded my expectations!,Wonderful product - makes brushing a breeze and just like the shampoo smells so clean! Thank you! We will certainly order this cream rinse again!
3,Not impressed,"Nice butterfly print, but any time you open or close this shower curtain the ""hookless"" part comes off of the shower rod. Seems to get slimy pretty fast and when you wash it the butterfly print comes off easily."
2,Pretty but cheap,"Thought this was exactly what we were looking for, but the quality was pretty poor. It was very thin and clung to the sides of the tub - and not in a good way! I kept it, but it will need to be replaced fairly soon."
1,Not worth it see through,Not what i expected not worth shipping back see through as wellvery thinly made
4,excellent,This is my first Dave Alvin experience and this album sounds great. Nice texts and melodies that spans from country to heavy blues. Excellent value!
4,Another solid effort from Alvin,"Ashgrove finds Dave Alvin reconnecting with his bluesy side--a side that almost always finds its way into his live performances but has been heard to a lesser degree in his previous few albums. I prefer his acoustic singer/songwriter mode, so for me Ashgrove as a whole doesn't rank among Alvin's finest work. That's not to say that there aren't very strong moments here: ""Rio Grande,"" ""Everett Ruess"" and ""The Man in the Bed"" are all splendid. That said, the disc has more glaring weaknesses than Alvin's previous efforts. ""9-Volt Heart"" ventures into mawkish territory, Alvin's thug narrator in ""Out of Control"" fails to convince, and ""Somewhere in Time"" closes the disc on a somewhat leaden note. But Alvin's strengths as a performer and songwriter more than compensate, and overall Ashgrove maintains the high expectations Alvin has set with his previous efforts."
4,get's a little wierd,"This one was good but it got a little to wierd for me, not that it couldn't happen I just live a more sheltered life. Good ending."
4,"From the first page, I couldn't put this book down!","This is my first Tami Hoag book. She is a master at hooking her readers. She used fasinating threads of culture, conflict and love to weave the reader toward her complex plot. The love story was as complicated and surreal as we find in real life. What a relief not to be sickened by unrealistic love scenes and dialogue that would never come out of a guys mouth. I look forward to reading many more of Tami Haog's books."
2,Tami's Tawdry Trash,"Intresting bathroom accessory. Tabloid type details of intimacy between enemies was drawn out and repetitive. The potential for new copy in the blond versus black coiffed haired females the sex was simply labled ""horrendous"". Story would have been improved if the editor had cut approximately two hundred pages."
2,This was a murder mystery???,"I've bought her books before and thought they were readable. But after several chapters, I kept expecting the front cover to change and for there to be a ranch-cowboy-stud ripping the bodice off the defnseless woman, and she is loving it. It was hard for me to really get into the story because the protagonist kept having fantasies about a man she though capable of murder. Get real."
3,She's done better....,"I've read <Night Sins>, <Guilty as Sin>, <Cry Wolf>, and <Thin Dark Line>. This is one of her okay books. It isn't a really fast read. Interesting for a short time but otherwise it's just another one of her romances disguised as a mystery thriller. I hope this one doesn't get made into a mini-series"
2,"Tami, Tami, Tami. What have you done?","I have really enjoyed every Tami Hoag novel I have read and I've read quite a few. Well, I've enjoyed every one of them up to this one. This was just goofy. I could not even enjoy a plot with possibilities because the characters were so absolutely ridiculous. Instead of a love affair, Marilee should have had grounds for a lawsuit. I only hoped that maybe the hero would turn out to be a psycho killer so he could be eliminated. This, I guess, is one of Tami Hoag's earlier works when she was in transition mode from romance writer to mystery/thriller writer. I am glad she progressed from this trash. I could not recommend this even to fans of Tami Hoag. And now, I am about to begin reading Guilty as Sin, the sequel to Night Sins. I'm still a Tami Hoagfan."
3,Mystery Buffs.....Beware!,"First off I want to say that if you are a total mystery buff and not into romance, do not read this book! I read this title after finishing my first Tami Hoag book, Ashes to Ashes. Dark Paradise is nothing like it. This book is mainly a romance between J.D. and Marilee. Marilee comes into a small town to visit her best friend Lucy, only to find that Lucy is dead. The longer she is there she starts to believe it wasn't a hunting accident, as the town has said, that killed Lucy. Determined to find the truth, she starts doing some investigating on her own. While in the meantime she fills her free time with J.D., where, of course, a love blossoms. I enjoy romances, but for some reason Dark Paradise didn't really hit me like I felt it should. I went and bought most of Tami Hoag's earlier releases, I just hope I enjoy them more that this one."
2,"A long, long book I struggled to finish","I am a fan of Tami Hoag and find myself very disappointed with this effort. It could use some editing and trimming, at least 150 pages worth! It seemed to me as if the two central romantic characters said and did the same things over and over again. And most of it was focused on the sex and sexual tension between them, which quite frankly got stale after a while. Focus on the mystery, the thriller...if I want romance, I'll read a Harlequin. Oh, and the thing that really bugged me? She referred to Samantha's car at least 4 times as a red ""Camero."" Is that a new car or does she mean the Chevy CamAro?"
3,"not enough suspense, too much romance","This book has a lot of humour and romance. What it does not have is suspense and mystery. This is not the usual Hoag thriller as most readers will realise after about three hundred pages of almost nothing happening except sex and beautiful descriptions of the country-side. It is basically a romance with a few murders and deaths. I normaly really enjoy this writers work but felt this was in a lesser capacity, and needed editing badly as it is too long for the plot and the content is repetative. The characters are very colourful but a bit clichéd, and the developement of the story is slow. Having said all that I did finish the book fairly quickly and was satisfied with the ending. Would be happy to recommend any of Tami Hoag's other books before this one."
2,One of her older works made to seem new,"This is not one of Tami Hoag's best. Take a look at the original publication date, and you will see that it is a much older book than her new suspense novels. I did not enjoy her romance books, but I loved ""Night Sins"", Guilty as Sin, and A Thin Dark Line. The publisher is trying to cash in on her later successes by bringing out old trashy novels just because they have her name on them. Do Miss Hoag a favor, and dump the old books; we want to see more like ""Night Sins""!"
3,Not her best,"In my opinion, this was not Hoag's best work. I found it predictable and the story line weak. I typically enjoy Hoag's work but this was not my favorite."
3,"Disappointed, but will try again","I was under the assumption that Tami Hoag wrote only crime and suspense novels, so I was surprised when I read 'Dark Paradise' which was filled with sex and romance. Not until after reading this book did I find out that she used to be a romance novelist. This particular book had more sex and romance than crime and suspense. However, I'm looking forward to reading 'Ashes to Ashes', because Hoag does spin a web full of intrigue, and she did it well enough to warrant another read."
2,"Don't bother if you liked ""Guilty as Sin"" and ""Night Sins""","After thoroughly enjoying ""Guilty as Sin"" and ""Night Sins"", I was hungry for Hoag's next novel. I began reading ""Dark Paradise"", was slightly intrigued, pushed ahead knowing it had to get better, and sorrowfully not making it through one third of the book. Ms. Hoag apparently has lost the ""touch"" she so skillfully developed in her previous novels, now wallowing in romanticism and ""wordy"" nonsense which is just a form of procrastination to lengthen the novel. I am not against romantic novels, but they have their place in literature; those of us who love the buildup, excitement, and conclusion of mystery/murder novels do not have much patience for this type of writing. I will attempt to read another of her novels, but if it does not meet the pace of her former accomplishments, Tami Hoag will be wiped off my ""favorite authors' list."""
2,"IT WENT ON, ON, AND ON","I'm a avid reader of Tami Hoag's books. Although they tend to be long, their great with all the twists and turns. Dark Paradise seems to deviate off the course that I started asking myself where is the mystery here. It could have been better. I hate it when women writer seem to say that its okay when a men treats a woman badly because he's afraid of the commitment of loving her and bec'she loves him she'll take it. That's bull. I was disappointed in the character Samantha. (no redemption there) However, Tami Hoag does redeem herself with her other books. I finished reading it, to see if I was right as to who killed her friend. I was."
5,another can't put it down,"I absolutely love the way Tami Hoag develops and interprets characters. You will fall in love again with the main characters and have a whole new look on cowboys. What strong willed, independent woman could resist the ""charm"" of a thick-headed, one track minded hunk of male testosterone. A must read the those who love action and suspense with just as much romance."
3,Nice mix of suspense with a little romance,"Loved the flow of the novel. Starting with the spur of the moment life change of the main character who finds that this may not be all she imagined, to the suspense of finding out who murdered her friend and why. The ending was kind of hoaky but looking at the authors past, not too surprising. The middle of the book is the best and the offbeat characters she meets during her quest for truth are very believable as they relate to people you may know yourself"
1,The shape hindered the entire process,"First things first...the design of this transformer does not fit into the standard European outlet...The outlet has a deep circle in which electronic cords are plugged in...great...now how was a big rectangle with short metal thongs supposed to fit into a circle? Anyway, I was unable to even use this item simply because of the TERRIBLE design. Well thanks, it really helped!"
1,Very bad,Description - deception. Power - max 25w. Transformer overheating after 5 minutes of work. Ceased to function after 10 minutes of work. Is money thrown away
1,Good for one use only,Why would anyone make a product that is such a piece of crap that it fails almost immediately? I have an 8 pound poodle. The first cut worked ok. The second cut not so good. About half way through the third cut these things stopped working completely. I cleaned them and played around with them but they are just junk and wore out. The Oster replacement blades sold here don't work with them.
3,15 piece dog grooming kit,"I wish this product also came with a groomer, just kidding. The product is good and the price is even better."
1,No compatability for Macs or Linux,"This camera seems pretty good from the specs, but buried in the description is that you can view the images with Internet Explorer only! It turns out that it uses an ActiveX control for showing the video. Do these people think it's still 1998? There are people at my work using Macs and Linux machines, and there is no way for them to access the video feed. Haven't these people ever looked at YouTube? It's possible to have open standards that work across different platforms, and not rely on antiquated technologies like ActiveX."
1,Good but very short life span,"I bought 3 of these and also bought about 14 of the 5300 model. These more expensive cameras with an optical zoom lens seemed to be good at first but they all eventually failed in the same way. The video has gone completely black on all three after about a year. The audio stil works and I suppose I could still use them as a 2-way comunication device, but that expensive color video with zoom is now useless. I tried running one again today just in case... but no luck. Same problem. Looking on the web I see that others have the same problem. This is the most expensive d-link product that I have bought and most disapointing. I was hoping that someone out there may know a way to fix them but I have not seen an answer on the web."
1,DCS-6620 focus gear wears out quickly.,I had three DCS-6620's and all three broke down within 1 to 2 years. I took them apart and they all have the same problem. The small plastic motor gear that runs the focus wears out and the teeth brake off. The gear is plastic and looks like it cost 5 cents. The camera has auto focus so depending on your lighting condition the focus may run several times per day. And it is just a matter of time before this gear breaks. One camera broke after 1 year as the autofocus ran more where I had it and the 2nd/3rd broke down around 2 years. Once it breaks you can throw your $400 camera away as the picture is just blurred without focus. I recommend not buying a Dlink DCS-6620 if you need the camera to last more than 1 to 2 years!
4,Thoughtful Exploration of Creation Concept,"Great album! One of the most fascinating things about it is that Jan didn't have any polyphonic synths! All of them were monophonic! He was most certainly a pioneer of early sythn sounds, and this album melds great sounds and great interpretations of the concepts of creation."
4,Rich and rewarding experience,With so much mediocre music flooding our lives today it's delightful to be able to retrieve gems like this. Those thick rich analogue synth sounds come out so beautifully on modern equipment. Jan Hammer still stands tall with this lovely early work
1,Minimal,"Very little content. If you want to learn about West Virginia, this is not the source.Waste of money."
4,"Review of Discoveries...America, West Virginia","Good content, just not enough about the whole state. Had hoped for more of a 'round the entire state' kind of dvd. I'm sure this is true for other states in the series. Perhaps going to a multi-dvd format per state might interest quite a few people"
5,Great game!,"No disappointment here at all. They did a great job preserving the old feel and it is really fun to play. I was worried that they would rush something to market, but this is a great extension of the original. I hope to see them make Space Ace 3D in 2004."
1,It might be a fun game...,"It doesn't work. I tried it on several computers. I have to figure out how to return it right now. Unfortunately the envelope was tossed out. I'll figure out who I bought it from and update so you can avoid buying anything from them. It wasn't Amazon but somebody who sells through them. I think my copy was pirated. Well, like I said, I'll update."
2,Not as it seems,"I remember when this first came out in the arcade at Disny Land in Southern California. It had a crowd of people around it for hours waiting for a turn to try their luck at this amazing looking game.Well, this is not that game. it has been restructured to play on your pc. What they did was butcher a arcade classic. The controls are shotty, the graphics sort of look the same but are not true to the original. This gets boring after the first 10 min of game play. Waste of time and money."
4,Wonderful for little one's!,My son loves this book. He is always pulling it out and bringing it to me so I can read it to him. He likes the artwork and I like it because it is teaching him the different numbers and names for animals. I love the aspect of him learning his numbers at an early age. My son is a year old and already loves books so this is a great way to incorporate learning.
5,"Old, but good","My 1 and 3 year old both love this book. Although its hard to find, it was definitely worth the search. Teaches counting, friendship, and is simple enough for infants to follow."
4,Large Bowl,I would have given this bowl a rating of 5 stars if it had been made in the USA. When I ordered it I didn't know it was made in China. It really is a great bowl but I want to purchase as many items as I can made in the USA.
2,"Stained, Scratched and Overpriced","I ordered the ivory, and it came with all sorts of scratches and stains on it. Unlike the photo, it has gray and brown stains and looks like I've owned it for a year. The size wasn't as big as I had hoped, either. I think I would have done better buying a bowl in a brick and mortar store - I doubt it would have cost this much, either. Delivery took 3 days longer than estimated, even though it said the item was in stock."
3,Fragile,"I like the size and the color of the bowl. Unfortunately, these bowls tend to break easily. I have ordered six of them.Two broke in transit and two cracked at home.Amazon was amazing at replacing the items."
5,wonderful bowl,"I purchased this bowl because I needed an oven safe bowl in order to bake a round cake. It's very useful, heavy duty, and beautiful. I would buy more in smaller sizes to make a set. Love it."
2,Factory Seconds,"I've had this set for years and love it, so when I broke a bowl and bought a few to add to the set I was shocked. AMAZON IS SELLING SECONDS AS IF THEY'RE REGULAR DISHWARE!!The set is ivory with rust colored highlights. The bowls that I recieved are, if fact, ivory, but the rust is either on part of the bowl (bottom only) or not at all. The highlights are supposed to be irregular, but not only on the bottom of the bowl.If you have the set these will not match. If you just want a pretty, sturdy, off-white bowl it's great."
2,REALLY simple platformer,"This game was pretty much the simplest kind you could ever get. You played a small alien dude with a big round helmet on a strange planet. The object of each level was to jump onto a platform that was moving back and forth. Then onto another one, moving slightly faster. And so on and so on. Ten platforms, ten levels. That was it.That's not to say it wasn't kinda cute and it did have the slightest re-playability. I have no idea what 'Zub' actually meant but in the instructions it stood for a variety of words. It's also the first word that my then 3-year-old cousin managed to read. If you come across an emulator for this very, very basic game then I still recommend you give it a quick go."
5,Danky Is tha' FYRE,"If ya haven't heard it, your definetly missing out. Green Acres is about to blow up tha' rap scene with a new style a flava' that not many people have heard. Check it out! It is truely the FYRE."
1,Bad Experience,I had to return this product because it had gone bad. The perfume was yellow and smelled of rubbing alcohol. I don't plan to order perfume from Amazon again. I'm still waiting a full refund.
2,A picture book,"A beautiful book, but it is principally a very short compendium of the Ruskin book assorted with awesome pictures!"
2,disapointing,"I always liked gloria, and even some of her songs weren't always that good, I gave her most of the time the benefit of the doubt. Recently I was given this album. I was very happy with it, since it was missing in my collection. Unfortunately my hopes turned out to be wrong. The whole record is an upbeat disc, with no moment of rest in it. The music is popular, not creative, and the same could be said for the lyrics, a lot of repetition. Some songs might work very well as singles, but on the record they drown.Please, gloria, stick to what you're good at, sensitive ballads and latin music, and don't try to pretend you're hip and younger than you really are.ps: I also had a disc with two songs translated in french, I wasn't even able to listen to them. Her accent is awful, and besides, don't translate, create!"
1,Read the FINE print!,"I do NOT recommend this collection--some of the songs are re-recorded versions, not the original hits you heard on the radio! (Unless you LIKE flabby, lackluster remakes.)Stick with labels you can trust, like Rhino and Collectables."
4,awesome CD,This CD is the best! It has a ton of great songs that I love to listen to. This makes also makes a great gift for one who loved the music of the 60's or who just loves great music! i would recommend this CD to anyone and everyone!
5,A homesteader's helper...,Sometimes you need to step back and look at broader concepts before you can get into detail. This book helps you do both. So you want to raise some chickens? Why? If its pet birds you want there are easier ways. If you are looking for a reliable food source for your family in good times and bad then backyard meat production is what you are looking for. This book walks you through it with advice from an experienced homesteader. Its like she's there with you to walk you through the steps and help you avoid the pitfalls. Well worth a place on your bookshelf.
3,Used it once and it worked fine,"Now I'm not an expert because I used it once. It pulled my chain link fence together and that is why I bought it. I should've gotten (or made) a fence stretcher bar to do this job right. It did the job. The price is why I bought this model as it beat out most others on that feature. I may never need to use this thing again but if I do just a few more times it has already payed for itself. I had one job to do and didn't want to spend much so this one did the trick. It was easy to use following the included instructions. It seems a solid piece of equipment. Made in China, isn't everything?"
2,"Disappointing -- buy ""The Very Best of ..."" instead","I accidently bought this instead of the stupidly similarly named ""The Very Best of Lee Ritenour"". The latter is quite excellent, the former though is incredibly dull by comparison. Make sure you buy the right one."
1,The Best Of Lee Ritnour,"This CD is a big mistake...Don't buy...Just like the other reviewer stated...buy (the very best of Lee Ritnour).When they remastered the CD they did a poor job.No gain,detail no nothing....If you do have this CD I recommend contacting the number on the CD.They sent me a return envelope and had me pick another CD of my choice that they carry..."
5,cookies,My Christmas cookies looked beautiful. Everyone who received them as gifts loved them very much and I look for other ways to use them
5,Love The Sparkling Sugar,I have never tried using sparkling sugar till I made my Christmas pies and cookies this year! The sugar gave an outstanding flavor and improved the taste of both pies and cookies. I love the convenient size of the bottle and will continue to use it in the future!
4,Outstanding Game - Great Fun,"You have to try this one - it is truly fun. Not too hard, not too easy with just enough challenges to make things light."
5,Fantastic Fun,I played this game with my 6-year old daughter and both of us had so much fun. There are so many surprises and the weapons are amazing.
4,a great innovation in its time,"The first ratchet & clank really helped PS2 in the sense of platforming, and just good old fashioned destruction. Before this game we didn't have much to define this perticular genre. Now adays, the second installment of ratchet & clank is out and i have already beat it 5 times. This game is great, but after beating ratchet & clank: going commando so many times, you realize that the second installment is a lot smoother than the first. My advice to you is to rent this particular installment and pick up the second at a game store in your town, you definately won't regret, becauase you will definately see the difference!"
5,The Best Game EVER!,"Ratchet and Clank is hands down the best game I have played. The graphics are awesome. If you look up at the sky in all the worlds the detail is amazing. On most of them it looks like they just took a picture of our sky and stuck it in there. The attention to detail is great. The difficulty can be a bit high but it is fun and challenging, not frustrating. Great game! It's my fav."
5,The All Time Best Game Ever!!!! Nothing comes close to R&C!!,"People listen up! This will be the greatest game you will ever play. The story line is funny, the graphics unbelievable, and don't even get me started about all the cool weapons! You get to fight, shoot things, swim under water, race hoverboards, fly space fighters and solve puzzles all while saving the world. You could not spend your money more wisely. Once you beat the game the first time a whole level of Gold weapons opens up for you to go after. You'll even actually be able to take some of this games weapons to the upcoming sequel. Buy it now so you can be ready R&C 2 when it is released in November. The Most fun my family has had playing games. It's like an interactive movie the graphics are so good!!"
5,Best Game,For Christmas I Got 8 Games. This Was My Fav. It Is Easy some times while it is hard at others.It is a must buy for you PS2 colection
4,_Going Commando_ is definately preferable...but this is fun!,"I do think this is a good game, and it's lots of fun and crazyness, but it's incomparable to _Going Commando_. My only real beefs with this game are that you can't quick select and freeze the game; everything is in real time, so you have to make sure you're either far from any danger or quick with your fingers. Also, there are no weapon upgrades, and as for Nanotech, there are only four units that can be lost before you die. If you want to upgrade your Nanotech, you have to *buy* upgrades, and not just earn them. There is no strafe, which can be quite useful with multiple targets.But this is not to say that I don't LIKE this game; on the contrary, I think it's quite addictive and fun. Some of the weapons are pretty cool (I'm especially fond of the Glove of Doom, with the four mini-robots which jump out and destroy closeby targets), and some of the gadgets are pretty nifty. All in all, I'd give this game 3 1/2 to 4 out of 5."
3,Fun One Time Through!,This game has okay playability and is pretty fun. The music is not the greatest nor are the controls. I think that some of the puzzles are fun but the graphics are not great at all. Hopefully Commando will be better.
4,Awesome Game,"This is a super fun game and easy to learn. If you are a gamer, this would probably be a thumbs up game for you. You can get all these cool weapons. If you have heard of the game Jak and Daxter, you would like this game at least 2 times better, but Jak and Daxter is really fun too. On this game you can buy all sorts of cool gadgets. If you get a weapon called the Rhino Gun, you can blast all kinds of villains and robots. If you like games like Shark Tale and such, you would probably not care for this game as much."
5,Long Time Gamer,"In my opinion, this is the best of the many Ratchet & Clanks...I have replayed it 3 times.Great quests, free range exploring, good camera controls, and a Great selection of gadgets and very creative weapons. The only draw back is you really need the cheat to get enough ""bolts"" to buy the RYNO (Rip You a New One)"
3,"A good platformer, but not the best.","This game is fairly well done, but lacks that special artistic touch seen in ""Jack and Daxter"" or ""Sly Cooper"". I recommend getting those titles first."
5,Fantastic game,Sell your soul and buy this game. The worlds are brilliant and colors and vivid and fancy. Gameplay is so real that your no only playing but living it. Welcome to the real world...
5,unbelivable game.,rachet and clank is extrodinary the graphics are the best ive ever seen. featuring lucious open landscapes enormus worlds and endless activities. fire up the bad guys with your gun and watch them explode pure action and excellence. so much bad guys action and the graphics are visually wonderful featuring flawless crisp animations. the charachters are beautifal and well crafted the controls are so easy. you can easily navigate rachet trough a series of worlds without a single control problem. the weapons are awesome and add great enjoyment to the endless festivities packed in this game. the music is excellent it sounds well orchestrated and dramatic. there are a few problems in gameplay and sound effects too hard sometimes but overall fun and challenging give it a shot.
4,Simple fun.,A fun romp for any age with some playful humor and weird storyline. Fans of futurama will love this.
5,A Must Have For The PS2,"I am not much of a platformer-game fan, but this game is absolutely incredible. The graphics blew me away. they are clean, crisp, running at 60 fps, and colorful. The weapons are a blast and rather original. It is a lot of fun to use the suck cannon and suck up enimies to shoot out at other enimies. The controls are tight and responsive. I never blame the game controls because i died. there were a few parts that seemd rather frusterating (for example, running away from the water), but on a whole, this game excells in all aspects."
4,Such a Fun Game,"I got this game on the pretext of getting it for the kids, but really got it because I thought it looked fun. It's been a lot of fun helping the kids through the levels and finding those golden bolts hidden throughout the game. There are only a few things I didn't like about the game, or rather thought was frustrating. Changing weapons is a pain. You have to go to a separate menu to get to your items and weapons. Another thing is that the last few levels are so difficult it was even hard for me to get through and impossible for my kids. Other than those issues, the levels are fun and colorful. The little upgrades, new weapons, and new items make leveling up fun."
5,Excellent book for written professional communication,"This book mainly presents strategies to write effectively in real world engineering/science situations, assuring that what you write is really read. It shows how to present your ideas so that your target audience understands it. It describes the characteristics that a document aimed to a technical person, to a lay person and to a manager should have.Besides, it shows how to write memos, letters, reports and even e-mails, explaining from the initial document outline, sentece/paragraph structure to the final polished form.I wish I had read this book when I was an undergrad, I had to learn how to write effectivelly in the hard way."
3,good for what it is,This small collection of Durer drawings is interesting but the selection is tiny: less than 100 of Durer's thousand or so existing drawings
4,Exactly as described,"Good product. Good price compared to local stores. I would recommend. I would probably buy again. One reason for the 4 instead of 5 rating is that I would have liked a front cover insert, so I could display on the front cover as well. The product is satisfactory. It is solid black color instead of two-tone like the smaller portfolios but it has fancy stitched edges."
4,Only a Mother Could Love Him,"I recommend this book wholeheartedly to anyone needing information on ADHD. My 13 yr. old grandson lives with us and I was at my wits end over his school work and unpredictability. I found this book and just devoured it. It was not long before I could see thru the eyes of my grandson and truly understand some of what he is feeling.The opinions stated in this book are not always mine, but I found a lot of his insight just so valuable and sometimes humorous. I have highlighted many passages and keep it by my bed so I can remind myself that I am not going crazy. Ben tells it like it is.Ben Polis is a brilliant young man who should be applauded for his courage in writing this book and sharing his life with us."
3,Hard to follow at times... but good - really useful,"This book is ok, but I found it hard to focus on Ben's story and experiences. I felt like I had ADHD (which I don't anymore)- with his disjointed story line and how it skips around, like reading a story written by a parrot on crystal meth. It was good though, and he is a pretty good author - I hardly found any spelling mistakes and it was over 100 pages.All round good book helpful for those seeking support through all of the issues ADHD sufferers experience. Good Work Ben!"
4,Review in the NY Times,"I am buying this book due to an interview with the author that was printed in the NY Times. The reference is: August 26, 2003Attention Disorder Advice, by One Who KnowsBy LAURIE TARKANAs the parent of two ADHD kids and wife of an ADHD adult, it will be very helpful to know how it feels from the inside."
4,its cool....but not that cool,alright....heres the low down... this game was awesome for about....hmmmm lets see.....2 months or so. It gets old pretty fast so if your interested in buying i would suggest that you rent it from a local video store before...see how you like it. if you love it...buy it. if you like it a lot but dont want to spend the money...maybe one of your friends has it. enjoy to the people who get it. its really fun. but beware for the future
2,Buy Cole not Frank,I was very disappointed in this CD.. I should have listened to some of it before buying. Buy Cole Porter only not Frank.
1,"Love, Hate","I love Cole Porter music. Could listen forever, However, this album sucks. When I bought it I thought it would be good. How bad could Frank Sinatra be? Well he's very bad and ruins Cole Porter's music. If anyone is considering buying this, please review it first."
5,Excellent CD!,"This is a terrific CD! I absolutely love it! Cole Porer is undoubtedly one of the great songwriters of our time, and with the brilliancy of Sinatra's singing, how could it be anything less than amazing? If you are a Great American Songbook fan and/or a Sinatra fan, this is one you must have in your collection."
2,a big disappointment,though i've been a ONJ fan since she made it in the USA in the early 70's i have to be truthful that this cd is a huge disappointment. it seems to be a collection of her various guest appearances in other artists albums and even the delivery of the songs were not that impressive. honestly i was not moved despite the well chosen holiday songs. there just was no spark and i disliked all those duets w/ various artists.wasn't what i expected for her first xmas cd after her long career. i really thought they were all recorded specially for her album and not a collection of her guest appearances.a big big disappointment from a ONJ fan.
1,If you can't say something nice be vague,Nobody was really trying with this CD. As much as I love 'Livvy I was VERY dissapointed. Maybe If you drink a lot of eggnogg before you put it on you won't mind so much. After all it's the closest thing to a Christmas album she's ever made.
2,WHAT HAPPENED!!!,being a big Olivia fan i feel terrible about this CD. listened to it once and that will be the last. Olivia's beautiful voice seems very out of place singing Christmas songs. She almost sounds at times as if she has lost her voice. Very dissapointing. Just glad i wasted my money on her (if thats a comfort to me)
5,Great Christmas Collection,"Olivia Newton-John's voice is a strong as ever and she has some very good duets, as well. I love the Kenny Loggins one. A must buy."
1,"I like Olivia, but.....","this sucks! She should not sing Christmas songs!Leave it to the good ole boys like Bing, Elvis, Nat...etc."
4,Not Bad...,"Unfortunately this and the re-package 20th Century Masters are both out of print. Olivia at the time of this release never recorded a complete Christmas album and as the reviews state, it's a patchwork collection comprised of her appearances on television and outside studio work, the bulk from a Hallmark collection. The previously unreleased ""The First Noel"" has a cold feel to it, the instrumental backing is keyboard with a pop tempo and Olivia's voice simply overdubbed. For me the standout track is ""Ave Maria"" with the London Symphony providing the lush strings and Olivia's fragile lead supported but not overwhelmed by full choir backing. Had an entire album been recorded with this same quality Olivia would have had a resurgence in her career and this album would have remained in print."
1,Awaken,"This album is a collection of weak tracks. It is the result of unimaginative, lazy posers who think they can hide behind the concept of artistic music without putting forth the time and effort in the studio. I wasted [money] on the 5.1 surround sound version, but even surround sound can't save these [artists]."
5,I bought this at the dollar store...,"I got this audio CD two years ago at Halloween time. It's an anthology of classic horror stories as told by the host Uncle Guts as his nieces and nephew listens in. Included are the stories: The Monkey's Paw, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, The Birth of Frankenstein, The Hitchhiker, The Log Cabin and The Story of Count Dracula. Great sounds, great creepy music and sound fx, charming interplay between the main characters (UNLCE GUTS: ""Ichabod was sooo in love with Katrina Van Tassle..."" NEPHEW: ""I thought this was a SCARY story, not a KISSY story!""), and classic tales for kids of all ages. A great mood setter for the Halloween season!A definitive MUST MUST MUST for Halloween lovers!"
5,Stellar performances and arrangements - Incredible!,"As one of the video interviewees said ""There are no passengers in this group."" Every song is performed with amazing articulation and dynamics. This is what all modern ""big band"" projects must aspire to. I bet few reach or exceed it."
3,Fantastic music; problematic media,"Some of the best big-band jazz I've ever heard. However, the Dual Disc (CD on one side, DVD on the other) would not play in the first four CD players I tried; I finally found one that could read it."
5,Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band XXL,"Gordon Goodwin is a superb composer and arranger and the musicianship of his band members is phenomenal. The DVDs contain interviews with the players, guest artists, and a lot of interesting information. I recommend purchasing his play along series. The transcribed solos alone are worth the price.Trumpet, Level 5-6 (Book & CD; Big Phat Band Play-Along Series) (Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band Play-Along)Gordon Goodwin Big Phat Play Along: Alto Saxophone (Book & CD)and others."
5,Rock/Country-Type Dino Cuts,This CD is a good deal...it's an import (uh-oh) but suprisingly is comprised of 24 tunes of excellent recording quality (for a mere $14). Many of the selections have a pop-country or early 50's rock sound to them. Most enjoyable. Buy this 2 CD set and you'll avoid getting duplicate songs if you already own the Capitol Collector's Series and Spotlight on Dean Martin.
5,MODERN PULP WITH A FLAIR,"The Wraith is a wonderful throwback to the purple prose of the bloody pulps with a hero clearly descendant from the likes of the Shadow and the Spider. A fast, action packed thrill ride with great character, both noble and villainous. Slam-bang kick off to a super new series. One I'm anxious to follow."
1,Beware deceptive product description!,"Buyer beware! Amazon's product description is ambiguous and potentially deceptive. The 150 pages here are well laid out, and could be helpful--but it's hard to know, since they don't contain the answers to the exercises. This is only one section of a larger program. While the description mentions a CD-ROM, that is actually sold separately (and is, at this writing, unavailable). Not having worked through these pages yet, I nonetheless hypothesize that, since they come with neither answers nor glossary, they will be of extremely little use. Unless you have access to the CD-ROM, please look elsewhere for what you hoped to find here."
4,If Gremlins shouldn't be fed after midnight....,"and you have a couple of kids like me, you know better they have to be physically EXHAUST before going to bed or boy you'll know how they intend to burn those extra calories. This toy is great for burning those ""extra"" reserves, plus it makes them move and practice balance. If you have a below 4 YO boy, you might as well buy a helmet for him, just in case. Helmets are cheaper than Doctors."
5,Britain's Best (and most underrated jazz pianist - WHY!!!),"this is sublime jazz by a pianist whose played with some of the world's best, yet goes uncelebrated in his own country, to their shame. If you don't believe me, listen to it, especially Philologie, which he wrote for Phil Woods. When did you last hear a British jazz pianist so inventive (he accompanies himself on electric piano)and so fast!"
2,"Good voice, but not the Huey I want to hear!","I really like the Huey from the DLG albums. I know one must move on eventually. But, maybe I'm , just so used to the DLG Huey that I can't get used to this other stuff on this CD. I'm still a huey Fan. Huey has taking salsa to another level in my life!!!!"
3,Still below DLG quality,"Dunbar has a spectacular voice, but he needs the steady hand of a top-flight producer to make him shine. Sergio George, producer for Dunbar's former group DLG, is the logical choice. But even his work with Dunbar as a solo performer has been lackluster. (The liner notes to this CD suggest that Dunbar and George have a rift.) This album is more varied, and takes more chances than Dunbar's first solo CD, but it is still well below DLG's high standard. One hopes that Huey will find the support and material that will complement his talents, otherwise a fine singer will have been wasted."
5,For all the DLG fans,"Huey Dunbar's sophomore solo album is a great improvement over 'Yo Si Me Enamore', which was too much of a pop album for any fan of DLG. A pleasing blend of salsa, hip-hop, reggae, bachata...did I miss anything? The CD gets constant play in my car. My only criticism would be the cover/insert, lyrics not included and what's with the photo's? The pics look like they were taken with a disposable camera! But really, who cares, the music is great. One of the best albums I've bought all year."
5,The networkers bible.,I have used this book from day 1 with my networking organization. It has given me great ideas of what works and what not to try. I have the pages marked and dog-eared. Everyone needs to have a copy of this book in their library if they are serious about network marketing.
3,Network Marketing for the 21st Century written in 1985,"The thought of writing a futuristic book about a burgeoning industry is an interesting concept. Can anybody say ""Back to the Future""? I didn't find anything earth shatering in this book except the fact the principles presented are tried and true from a sales point of view: Company, Goals, Training, Products, Persistence, Marketing and Attitude. His assumptions of the expansion of Network Marketing are based on Faith Popcorn's classic ""The Popcorn Report"". Too bad Rod Nichols hadn't seen Clicking (published in 1998)- the phenomenal followup to The Popcorn Report.Successful Network Marketing for the 21st Century book is a good primer for someone who wants to learn the industry but I recommend ""Guerrilla Multilevel Marketing"" by Dr. Jay Conrad Levinson if you really want to explode your downline."
1,I agree with Satina Scott!,"I was given this book by a friend who suggested that I read this to get a chuckle. After reading this book, and REALLY forcing myself to do so, in order to get a good idea of what the book is about; I can only conclude that anyone who gives this book mmore then 1 star MUST be in Mr. Nichol's downline and was coerced to do so."
3,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield,"Raven Shield has got to be the weakest Tom Clancy game while Splinter Cell is the best. Built on the Unreal 2 engine the game looks and runs great but the main interface is struck in low resolution. There is not much of a story just pick your team, hunt down terrorist, defuse bombs, save hostages ect. The single player gameplay is impossible due to lack of save games. In one mission you need to sneak in and sneak out undetected which is really frustrating. The AI is bad weak sometimes over smart and sometime dumb. The multiplayer and co-operative gameplay are great but i expected a better single player gameplay after Ghost Recon and its expansion packs which were great."
5,RaVeN ShiElD,"raven shield is a very great game, but naturally it has its flaws. first of all, we still cant jump! almost every FPS game on the planet lets you jump. the greatest improvments are the graphics and sound effects by FAR. its cool that youve got tear gas and other new weapons too, but now they all have stats that make most suck! and every single gun in the game has a horrible recoil problem. i shoot a few bullets and my gun moves around so much i miss by a foot. but just keepmoving ur mouse down. all in all if you are a hardcore fan of RS buy this, if you are soomewhat new to the series get the very first one without the expansions because the graphics worsen."
5,Great Multiplayer Game!!!,"I downloaded the multiplayer demo a few days ago, and I've been playing ever since. I normally play Counter-strike, but this game just blows it away. The graphics are 100x better, if not more. It is also a more realistic game. Stealth is as important as shooting skill. You don't have to pay for the guns in this game, but you do need to choose wisely and put on the right attachments. So far, the maps i've seen look amazing, and I know they'll keep getting better. If you are a fan of Counter-strike or any other multiplayer shooter, you gotta check out this game!"
5,Great Game,"Old first person shooter, but still the very best IMO. Wish more people still played it. I will be the last one playing at the rate things are going."
4,"Good game, but require Patient, Passion and Planning to Play","I have completed virtually all the Tom Clancy Rainbow series except ghost recon (which I am not sure it is in the Rainbow series). I also completed Splinter Cell as well. Overall, if you don't cheat (ie. no cheat code in the game and no autoaims), the hardest part of the Rainbow series is the recon mission. And thankfully, RavenShield only have one recon mission and it's super easy compared to the previous games! Also, since it is using the unreal engine, new map and map editor may be available! So this game is expandible!People who don't like the Rainbow series normally play games with med-kits (Rainbow has no med-kits and mostly one-shot-kill) and jumpy (Rainbow can't jump). Also, Rainbow requires players to be patient and to have plans. So if you like med-kit and jumping and close-combats, try the Counter Strikes or Unreal instead."
2,does not come close to previous R6 titles,"I have purchased and played every Tom Clancy title to date, both R6 and Ghost Recon. Noticed huge decline in release quality when UBI took over and released GR. It took a mod by the name of ""Cold War"" to make GR good.Raven Shield was released with a CD Key verification issue from hell. I bought the game day one and had to switch from DSL to Cable to play MP. After playing for over a month now I have noticed the AI is not as good as previous R6 titles. It offers nothing new and in my opinion less that previous titles. The maps are weak. Yes, the graphics and sound are good, but I would expect them to be.Bottom line, if you love first person shooters and especially Rogue Spear, prepare to be wowed at first, and bored a month from now. I am now waiting for Swat 4: Urban Justice."
2,NO save game function!,"Bought this after playing (and loving) Ghost Recon Gold - the first Clancy game I've ever played. Learning curve was steep coming from games like Return to Wolfenstein, Quake, Half-Life etc. but well worth the effort. Raven Shield looked to have so much promise but although the graphics and gameplay are excellent, the AI is real flaky. The previous articles written here cover well the good and bad points so I'll tell you what drops this from a four to a two star game for me - NO SAVE GAME ability.Nothing like playing the same mission over, and over, and over because you make a single mistake and a hostage gets shot - hence the automatic mission failure. If there's a way to save I haven't found it and that's a game killer for me no matter how well it shines in other areas. If this doesn't bother you then by all means buy it, otherwise I'd recommend Ghost Recon and/or Sum of All Fears."
1,Get it out the doorI,"Out of 20 years of playing video games, I have never played a game that sucked worse than this one. Not that it locks up. Heaven forbid that the agony be interrupted. This game is crammed with inconsistencies. Over and over, the shooters, although obscured behind objects, have the ability to shoot you when you are unable to shoot them. At distances, and many other instances, the sights appear to be locked on but when you repeatedly shoot, the computer opponent cannot be brought down. The left hand keyboard controls are hard to find and easy to get lost in. I believe this software to be reflective of a ""get it out the door"" philosophy that pervades Engineering today. Get it out the door so we can start making money and the hell with the customer. I am so outraged; I will support nothing that UBI has anything to do with ever again. If I were Tom Clancy, I would hang my head!"
2,Who is smoking the cheap stuff?,"Is it the developers or people who paid $60.00 for this repetitious and unimaginative piece of garbage?Although I agree that there has been an improvement in Graphics, the game is plagued with problems much like its predecessor. It seems the developers haven't improved the game at all. The storyline is very similar to the two games before it and layout of the missions seems almost identical, as well.In single player missions your team members seem blind and AIs can take you out with a 9mm from 200 yards with a single shot. Ridiculous.I got this game at Boxing day sale in Canada for 20 Canadian dollars. If you did spend more than 20 US than you are smoking the cheap stuff:)"
3,Full of promise but never delivered,"Bugs, playability problems, and a poor interface design are the glaring issues I've had with this game. After several patches, I'm still unsatisfied with Rainbow Six 3. If I were in the market for a first person shooter, look to Call of Duty or Battlefield 1942. If you don't like World War 2 shooters, then hold out for Ghost Recon 2."
5,This has been re-released ! Don't pay inflated collector's prices for a copy.,"Last year, 2009, saw the re-release of this CD in a 3-pack called ""The Collection"". It also includes the ""Swing and Dance with Frank Sinatra"", and the Rodgers and Hammerstein disc. This 3-pack comes as a brick with an individual jewel case for each of the 3 CDs; also the original inserts from the first CD releases of these titles are duplicated. Each CD has the same track listing (with bonus tracks) as the original individual CD releases(Amazon's track listing for ""The Collection"" shows each disc having one less song, but this is not accurate.). Amazon currently has this 3-pack for 23.98 new; marketplace copies can be had for around $17-$18 plus shipping. Bottome line, don't pay an inflated collector's price for a CD copy of ""The Voice of Frank Sinatra"" when this 3-pack is in print and easily available."
2,Broke the first night!,"I took it to a party & the concept is great but after a few pictures the plastic broke where the top extender attaches to the clear plastic holder. It should be made of steel, not plastic. My camera is a Power Shot & very light. Disappointed!!!!!"
3,Should come with cement,"It broke the first three minuted I had it, and I had two of them. A little glue here and there and it seems to work fine. Two stars because it's kind of cheap and now I am scared my $400 camera might hit the ground. The extra star because now I can play survivor man in the back yard."
1,Not worth the money,"Hose is junk, started to short out 9 days after the return window :( Basically as you vacum and the hose moves the electrical connection is lost somewhere and the vacum shuts off.Guess I will see what AMEX will do to force the return"
5,Great hose,I needed this very hose because mine got broken when it dropped. It isn't really fragile but then again it will break.It has lots of electronic built in features and the wires are internal so there's no wires to catch on anything.
4,A new Expirence,"Yes, i have learned about the Holoculst and been to the museums dedicated to the ""Final Sollution"" but never have I really endured the Whole story at a piont where i could totally understand the situation these people had to face. After reading the book from a ""Teenage"" perspective i really began to understand how horriable it was for the people of Jewish belief or just ancestory."
5,If I Should Die Before I Wake is about the Holocaust.,"If I Should Die Before I Wake is a story about the Holocaust. Two girls named Hilary and Chana are the main characters in the story. Hilary is a member of the Great Aryan Warriors, a group who hates Jews. Chana is a Jewish girl living at the time of the Holocaust. She is trying to look out for her family, and make sure that she survives this terrible ordeal. The climax of the story is when the two girls meet, and they both realize that nobody is perfect. This book deserves to be read, because it helps you to understand the Holocaust."
3,"An interesting, but strange story!","I thought this book was very interesting, but didn't quite understand it. She lives the life of the woman next to her in her coma. It just was a little too weird for me. I read the book fast and finished it in two day so it was definetly page-turning. It is a good book to read, but a little confusing at times."
3,If I Should Die Before I Wake,In the begining of the book a girl was sent to a nozi concintration camp in Poland. Their in that camp she saw her mothers freind so she expected that her mother was their. Later she had seen her mother scrubing the floor with alot more people including her daughter. They had eight hour roll calls every day were the guards made sure none of the people excaped or got away from the camp in any way.Later in the book the daughter saw her father hanging by his feet in tree. She ran towards him then two nozi guards came out and told her to go back she wouldn't so they forced her back and then shot her father. Later in the middle of the book a new girl nozi guard came to the camp she alot more hash than the other ones.When that guard came the girl tried to excape from the camp but it didn't work she caught but luckly let off with a warning. She had kept on trying to excape but it didn't work. ...
5,"If I Should Die Before I Wake by: Carolyn in Madison, Ohio","""If I Should Die Before I Wake"" is a great and exiting book. It talks about a girl named Hilary who is a neo-natzi. Hilary gets into a motorcycle acident and finds herself in a Jewish hospital. This book is great because of the way it swithes between characters. While Hilary is in the hospital she dreams about a jewish girl named Chana. You she what Chana goes through and how she struggels to survive with everything that happens to her. Hilary will start to change and you she how her feelings and thoughts change about jewish people. This is a great book that makes to cry somtimes and laugh the next. I recomend you read this book today you will love it."
4,One of the best books ever!!!,"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is one of those book that once you start reading it, it is hard to put down. The author of this book does a great job of explaining all the things that went on during the hollacost. The book is hard to follow in the begging but you understand it better after the first few chapters. It really does give you a better understanding of what went on and how the neo-nazi's treated the Jews. If I Should Die Before I Wake is an awesome book for teenagers or adults to read."
5,Five stars are not enough,If I Should Die Before I Wake was a very stirring and disturbing book. The author made it sound very real. The main character(s?) were very developed. This book is one that will keep you up at night thinking what you would have done if you were in Hilary/Chana's place. I will not soon forget this book. Life-changing.
5,wow!!,"This is an amazing book. It is ver descripitve and I really understud how the characters felt. I recomend this book to EVERYONE, young and old! Another book like this is called ""Anne Frank and me"". Both books are about the Holocost and a teenage girl being brought back in time to re-live someones life. Read both of them, you wont regret it!!!"
4,Another Devil's Arithemtic,"As much as a person may say differently, this book basically follows the same plot and has the same point of view basically. Still a good book to read, but if you have read The Devil's Arithmetic youll probably only be disappointed."
3,Good book,"I have to say I loved the book when i first read it. I thought the story dragged a little at the beginning but picked up once Chana and her family reached the ghetto. I have a huge complaint of the book however. Some of the better parts of this book appear to have been taken from another holocost book, the devil's arithmetic, Which was much better. It was a story of a girl who became Chaya who was taken to one of the camps. They had the whole thing about ""remember"" and Chaya stook by her old aunt who was wise and helped everyone around her, there are much more that i cant think of off the top of my head but notice any similaritys? I still gave it 3 stars though because it was an enjoyable read."
4,Gracie vs Sakuraba,"If for nothing else, the Gracie vs. Sakuraba fight is worth the price of the DVD. This is one of the best fights in modern MMA history. Also, Sakuraba (at least on this night) was arguably the greatest pound for pound fighter in the world during this tourney. Even after going 90 minutes with Gracie, he almost submitted Vovchanchyn in the next fight. Unfortuanatey, the rest of the fights (including the final), fall a little short, but then again, when compared to the Gracie/Sakuraba fight..most fights will."
5,"Concise, Eloquent, Airtight","Murray Rothbard applies the theory of freedom across several different scenarios. His policies on equality, divisions of labor, children's rights, and feminism culminate in a consitent worldview; a worldview in which freedom truly reigns supreme.What stands out most about Rothbard is how accessible he is. His ability to clearly and concisely portray an arguement with simple language is unparalleled.This is one of the books I recommend most because of the range of subjects, the consistency of the solutions, the immutability of the logic, and the the elequence of prose."
1,Beware Cheap Plastic - Not as Pictured,These are cheap plastic chips not worth the postage. I am immediately returning for credit!
5,Epiphanic Blues,"I remember previewing this album at a used record store on a trip to Boston. I only listened to the first few seconds of each track, because I was already home. Perhaps my favorite album."
4,A Good Book,"I have a lot of guitar books, and I find this one to be very practical. It's not your traditional way of learning guitar, and skips over some of the tedious things to get to the heart of the matter. You will want to know some music basics before trying to use this book. Don't try to wade through it without some theory. For guitarists who want to get to a new level, this is a great book. And not really all that terrifying."
2,Shoddy,There are multiple exercises per audio track. This makes it extremely difficult to get exercises up to speed as you cannot repeat exercises and have to constantly put down the guitar and rewind the CD. This negates the entire purpose of the book. Avoid at all cost!
1,Very Basic,"This book is very, very basic. It's a handful of lame exercises that have nothing to do with playing music. Perhaps if you've never touched a guitar....ever, you would find it useful. Nothing terrifying about it. It's just plain silly."
3,"Book is great, CD is a mess","If you are looking for lots of ideas on how to build chops then this book rates at 5 stars. It is really fantastic.What is not good is the CD for all of the reasons already mentioned, especially how several excerises are put into a single track. This means you have to use the fast forward of your CD player to get to the right location. CD player's fast forward features are bad.The playing on the CD is not good. Whoever is playing guitar makes too many mistakes to count. There is even playing where extra notes on other strings are hit by mistake. Almost every excercise from 60 and on has some sort of buzzed or mis-picked note. Very sloppy. Sorry to say that whoever is playing here needs to spend more time practicing."
3,Eh....,"I've bought quite a few books over the years, I would have to say this is one of the least useful. I'm pretty sure just about anyone could come up with the exercises in this book. Also, the CD examples are anything but terrifying, I was able to play well beyond those examples, which sort of left me not particularly satisfied. I think a better, way more comprehensive, and much better audio tracks version of this book is the Creative Guitar, Guthrie Govan books, there is absolutely no comparison, none at all. Everything in this book is better explained, and better played. I normally wouldn't write a review, but I feel a little mislead with the other reviews on here, and wanted to chime in."
5,Great book!,"I have had this book for about a month now, and i have done nothing but improve my coordination and skill level on my guitar. Great buy!"
5,With two of these it is fantastic.,"These are designed to interlock together so you can clean your larger engines all at once as you note in the diagram one will only cover one set of wheels at a time on standard engines. As another person pointed out do not press down on the engine. What I found works best for me is keep most of th weight off the engine for a few seconds while slowly lowering the engines full weight on the scrubber. You do need to hold the engine as it will power right on off the pads. This is the only way to really clean engine wheels that I know of, the way I did it before was with a wire brush which only gets the part of the wheels showing when removed from the track."
4,I'm just too busy!,"All of us, even of those who know it's our civic duty to serve, cringe when we get the notice that tells us it's time once again to serve our country by reporting for jury duty. Many of us spend many precious moments coming up with excuses that we can give the court. Well, worry no more. Minnie Dix has compiled an impressive list of excuses you can use to escape jury duty. 150 REASONS WHY I CAN'T SERVE ON JURY DUTY offers the crazy, the silly, the world's biggest lie and the impossible reasons for not doing your civic duty. In just a few minutes, you can have the best - or maybe the worst - reason for shirking. And you can get a big laugh while you're trying. It's a fun little book to have around when you're feeling down and out and don't want to go to work either! Some of those excuse just might work...on the other hand, are you ready to collect that unemployment check?Reviewed by Alice Holmanof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
1,Not for self study,"Yes, this book has lots of problems. That's all. It is a book for those who already know the theory, and definitely not for self study. And it's also very confusing when trying to explain some concepts."
5,Includes a compilation of their best hits. Great cover!,"Tracklist:1.Don't you worry 'bout a thing 2.Everyday 3.Still a friend of mine 4.Givin' it up 5.I hear your name 6.A shade of blue 7.Roots 8.Talkin' loud 9.Always there 10.Colibri (Instrumental) 11.Out of the storm 12.Good love 13.Deep waters 14.Jump to my love 15.ChangeFor further information, see Incognito Everyday"
4,"Lighter than Troublegum, but not much more melodic","Pardon me for the title; Semi-Detached is NOT by all means a poor album. It is AS melodic as Troublegum. The thing I love on this album is that it is so unsuperficial. Every listening brings more to the songs, and they are not as simple or direct as the Troublegum-tracks. When I first heard this album, I was very dissapointed with it, and I know Andy Cairns himself doesn't rate this too high, either, but you have got to admit, that Therapy? is a mastergang when it comes to offering catchy melodies, but also making the song multi-dimentional. For a long time I had trouble with remebering the last songs of the album, but as I listened to it again, I found out there are real diamonds in the end. For example, ""This Boy's Asleep"" is definately among the best slower T?-tracks. Other tope ones: ""Church Of Noise"", ""Black Eye, Purple Sky"", ""Safe"", ""Straight Life"", etc."
3,Question Mark,"Semi-Detached has a few black adrenaline rushes - Church Of Noise, Black Eye Purple Sky, Stay Happy - that remind you what a convincing kick in the teeth their Troublegum album was. But for the most part, this album seems rather dull to me; not a criticism one could previously imagine levelling at Therapy? The production is loud, messy and indistinct, which is odd since it was produced by Chris Sheldon (who handled Troublegum.) Overall, Semi-Detached gives the impression that Therapy? may have already played their best hand."
3,Review,This aid is helpful. I don't like the way you are supposed to get the toilet paper off of it when you are done. It never comes over no matter how I wrap it. Otherwise it does help.
2,Doesn't work well,"I bought the blue one on another listing. This item doesn't work very well. The paper doesn't stay on well when wiping. Due to the friction of your skin the paper usually either tears or gets pushed down and over the end of the device, but is still attached underneath. I even tried wrapping the toilet paper several different ways around it and it didn't help much. I tried using a half-sheet of paper towel tightly held in the device and it doesn't work well because it seems that the arm that keeps the paper on it underneath is too weak. It needs to be a much tighter fit. Plus it should be redesigned. I think the grabber arm should be on both sides of the device instead of one on the bottom. If it was on either side of the device I think it would hold the paper much much better. I wish this worked well but it simply doesn't. I'm probably going to buy the bottom buddy and see if that is any better."
1,Piece of Junk,"Anyone that buys this product might as well just flush thier money down the toilet. The one I got would not hold onto the paper in any way. Which makes it totaly worthless. And due to the nature of the product, it is unreturnable. So its just money flushed down the drain."
2,What a shame!!,"I just hate to have to write a bad review for a Rachel Gibson book, but...I just could NOT stand this book. It was hard to get into the romance when all I wanted to do was scream at Jack ""She kidnapped your son!! What are you thinking???!!"" I mean seriously, how can you honestly believe that he had any feelings for her except hate - heck, even I REALLY hated her. I had absolutely NO sympathy for her or her dead husband. Then, to top it off, I'm supposed to understand the logic (after everything Jack was put through) that it's HIS responsibility to ""get over the anger"". I think she should have spent the rest of her life ""putting up with the anger"" simply to make up for the horrifying things she did to that man. Just awful!"
2,uhm... weird book!,i found this book to be rather odd!! not one of my favorites at all!! i mean i just couldn't get passed what Daisy and Steven did to Jack... why should she get a happy ending?! i felt bad for Jack throughout the whole book... i mean i don't know how i would react if i found out i had a son 15 yrs. ago and didn't get to see him grow up.this is a very weird book... read at your own risk!!
2,Bad Editing!,"I was not surprised to see such a large number of negative reviews for Daisy's Back in Town. I, too, felt it was not Rachel Gibson's best work. Storyline aside, I felt this book lacked a good editor. The spelling of Jack's receptionist Penny's last name goes back and forth from Kribs to Cribs over the course of the novel. The worst gaffe, however, was the book's reference to ""Hans Solo"" (a Star Wars reference). Even as a person who is not a Star Wars fan, I know that the proper spelling of Harrison Ford's character's name is Han Solo. In their eagerness to place these books in the hands of the teeming masses, romance publishers are neglecting the quality of what they publish.The storyline seemed predictable, and there was nothing exemplary, unique, or exciting about it. As others have stated, Getting Lucky was a much better read."
2,avid romance book reader,"I have been a fan of Rachel Gibson since her first book. This one, I don't know if I would even let this person in my house, let alone have sex with them, unprotected at that. I was disappointed with the story. Like I said I have always liked her books, but this one, left a little to be desired. Hopefully next time will be better. I try to give an author the benefit of the doubt, but if you get burned more than once, your are less apt to buy the next book. I've done that with a few authors."
3,"Good story, but moves slowly","Not the greatest romance I've ever read, but I did want to finish it. I think the same story could have been told with half the pages."
2,Didn't care for this one at all...,"I've read a couple of Rachel Gibson's books and found them quite enjoyable. However, this one was just a turnoff. I didn't particularly care for either Daisy or Jack. Daisy spent literally half the book just trying to tell Jack the truth about Nathan and in the end Nathan did it for her. When Jack was for good reason angry with her she just seemed to be oblivious about why. Frankly Jack wasn't any better than Daisy, he just seemed stuck is a state of perpetual adolescence whose thought process rarely seemed to move above his waistline. Talk about whiny, self absorbed losers. I just ended up feeling like smacking both of them upside the head and telling them to just grow up."
1,Phoning it in,"What a disappointment. Like many other reviewers here, I consider myself a serious Gibson fan, but it seemed as if everyone involved in this novel was phoning it in. I had trouble getting past (which is consistently spelled ""passed"" in the novel, by the way) the incredible number of grammatical and spelling errors, and shouldn't have bothered: there was no snappy, funny dialogue; little in the way of poignancy; and, as others have noted, characters who are far from compelling and even somewhat reprehensible. I won't give up on Rachel, because I believe she is truly talented, and I encourage other potential readers not to judge her solely by this book. It was a rush job from beginning to end."
3,"Uhhmm, undecided!","I havent finished reading this book yet but decided to check the reviews of other readers. The book is definitely readable and a quite like the characters. My biggest problem is I find the story line to unbelievable. How can you get pregnant and tell the best friend and not the father? Does that make any sense to anyone? I know you can be lonely and confused and all the usual teenage emotional stuff, but give me a break. This is too incredible to be feasible.The book is OK but as mentioned by previous reviewers you just sympathise with the main character as what she did was criminal and no amount of reasoning can justify her actions."
1,Boring and dull,I have to agree with the majority. This book was not worth reading.There was nothing to like about anyone and the story was boring.
2,"Great Writing, HORRIBLE PREMISE...","I love Rachel Gibson as a writer. She has a wonderful way with words, and it is that alone which allows me to give this book 2 stars. Because I absolutely hate the story line. I just cannot enjoy a romance novel in which the heroine has kept a child away from his/her father. It is absolutely unforgiveable. If the father is a maniac or unfit, and it is done to protect the child physically, then sure. But to never tell the hero that he has a child solely because ""I was afraid you didn't love me any more"", is ridiculous. And that was Daisy's excuse. After that, I just didn't want to see Jack fall back into a relationship with Daisy. It was a lousy thing that she did, and she is the worst kind of heroine--selfish and inconsiderate. I'll try other Gibson books, but this one is a must skip for anyone who feels the way I do on the subject. If you like lying, deceitful, selfish heroines then this is the one for you. Because like I said in the beginning, it is well written."
1,One Star is Giving Too Much,"I discovered Rachel Gibson with her book True Confessions, which I loved. I then went through and read all of her previous works (Simply Irresistable, Truly Madly Yours, and It Must Be Love), and I was impressed. Anxiously I awaited Lola Carlyle Reveals All, and I was slightly disappointed. Then came See Jane Score, which I had to force myself to finish. When I saw Ms. Gibson had written another, I talked myself into giving it a try. I couldn't even finish Daisy's Back In Town.This book is the antithesis of anything romantic. Selfish people making selfish choices and hurting everyone around them is not a good premise for a romance novel. If you want to read good romance, read her first four books. Bluntly I'm beginning to wonder if Rachel Gibson shouldn't hang up her pen and admit defeat to writer's block."
1,A rotten romance.,"A perfidious plot and wretched characters. Read the other reviews for the details. The story is flawed and frustrating. Why did Daisy have to deliver Steven's letter in person? Based on her and Steven's past cowardly behavior it should have been mailed. If Jack was so traumatized by Daisy and Steven's marriage betrayal that he had trust issues and was borderline misogynistic, how would his character truly act if he found out they kept his son from him for 15 years? Get real! He might have murdered Daisy, not married her! This is not a story of redemption and forgiveness. Redemption requires genuine remorse. Forgiveness cannot be forced. Read Rachel Gibson's romantic comedies, they are enjoyable."
4,Good but not great!,"I tend to love Rachel Gibson in general. This book wasn't great, but wasn't all that bad either. I think the thing that disturbed me most was the fact that there were many typos throughout the book, ""passed"", ""where"", etc. Nothing worse than a book that isn't free of spelling errors."
2,Not Rachel's best work,"I usually love any book by Rachel Gibson. Her humor, snappy dialogue, and wonderful character's always have me coming back for more. It appears that Rachel has tried to explore new territory with this book and the results are unfortunate. The humor and lightheartedness is not present in this book. It is impossible to sympathize with Daisy's character. What Daisy and Jake's best friend did to the hero Jake is unforgivable. I couldn't get past it and it pretty much ruined the story for me. If this is your first book by Rachel and you were unimpressed, I recommend giving her another try with ""See Jane Score"" or ""Truly Madly Yours"". Way better books in my opinion."
2,Such a bummer!,"I've enjoyed Rachel Gibson in the past and was looking forward to an entertaining read when I picked up Daisy's Back in Town. Unfortunately, the storyline was the typical ""old flame doesn't know about his child"" and the characters were disappointing. Jack really rubbed me the wrong way. I kept thinking, ""no wonder she left in the first place!!"" Usually Ms. Gibson's books are humerous and her characters seem real but this book left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe next time."
1,disappointing book,"I should have known not to pick up a book with secret baby plot in it. To say this book has a weak plot is an understatement. Both Daisy and Jack were unsympathetic characters I couldn't seem to care about, no matter how much I tried. All in all, it's a disappointing read."
1,Absolutely awful!,"I agree with all of the other readers who hated this book. I think even one star is too much. I don't know how any reader who said they loved this book could be serious about the ""love"" between Daisy and Jake. There wasn't any. Lust maybe, but not love. I don't know how anybody could pull the stunt that Daisy and her husband,(Jake's supposed best friend), did and expect Jake to forgive. I tried to finish this book since I invested time and money but couldn't stomach any more after having Jake finally find out the truth, Daisy thinks she'll go merrily back to her old life and he'll wave bye-bye. Puh-lease! This was the most clueless, unlikable heroine ever.Read any of Ms. Gibson's other novels for a truly enjoyable read, but skip this one."
5,Loved it!,"I can't believe there's any negativity with this book. I loved every single word. I have been looking forward to this book for a long time, and when I read it, I was not disappointed. Far from it! It was vintage Gibson, and it's going on my keeper shelf right there with all her other wonderful books. Jack and Daisy were both sympathetic characters to me, the teenage son was very realistically portrayed, and Daisy's sister was priceless. Keep 'em coming, Ms. Gibson!"
1,ZZZZZzzzzzzzzz,The book was pretty good if you have insomnia because it really puts you to sleep. Daisy and Jackson were about as appealing as root canal. Don't waste your money.
2,Totally Unbelievable,"Like so many others I have been a big fan of Rachel Gibson since her first book. I love her writing style, snappy dialog and how quick witted her characters usually are. But this book was just plain sad. The plot was beyond flimsy and there was no real conflict, just misunderstanding.What bothered me the most was how she kept emphasizing the fact that they all lived in a small community and everyone knew everyone else's business, but yet in fifteen years no one ever knew that Daisy had a teen pregnancy and a shotgun wedding to a kid who wasn't even her baby's daddy. That's the kind of gossip that usually becomes legendary in small towns! But no one ever knew? No one saw her buying a preganacy test? No one saw her at a doctor's office? No one ever talked to her mother and found out she was a grandma? Also are we supposed to believe that NEVER in fifteen years did she visit her mother and sister?"
2,Usually a huge Rachel Gibson fan...,"This premise was disappointing; no, actually it was frustrating.Not telling Jack he was a Dad might have worked as the young, hurt girl Daisy was when she got pregnant. Not telling him for fifteen years and then after telling him later saying, ""...if you and I are to have a future, you have to get past it"" is beyond imaginable.I couldn't get past the general plot. Gibson writes well and there are enjoyable & fun parts...but not enough to make it worthwhile. Wish I would have passed. Gibson's talented, and I hope to enjoy her next venture."
2,So disappointed,Daisy is a bitch and I didn't want her to have a happy ending. What she did was unforgivable and I'm so mad Jack forgave her.Besides that the book was well written.
3,Acceptable,"Since I bought this used, I was expecting normal wear and tear. It had more damage than I was expecting, but it was still acceptable"
5,love it!!!!!!!,"Did we all read the same book? Daisy's Back In Town is wonderful. The hero is hot and Daisy is gutsy. Loved Daisy's sister Lili.Don't let the bad ""reviews"" of this book stop you from buying it. I think some of the nasty reviews are written by the same person."
5,Hit all my romance buttons,"I read this book in one night and feel a re-read coming on.It's everything I want in a romance book. Angst passion and humor.Daisy Brooks has come home to Lovett Texas to make things right with the man she wronged fifteen years ago. When she sees her former lover, Jack Parrish, the passion they shared years before burns just as hot. The two of them are older now and wiser, but Jack must forgive Daisy if they are to have another chance at happiness."
1,THIS WAS THE FIRST GIBSON BOOK I HAVE READ...........,THIS WAS A SHALLOW BOOK AND I WILL ONLY READ THE OTHER TWO I BOUGHT BECAUSE I HAVE PAID FOR THEM! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK BUT I DO RECOMMEND THAT YOU READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING ANY BOOK.
3,I was disappointed. . .,"As hard as I tried, I just could NOT like this book. Although the book was well-written, as Rachel Gibson's always are, what Daisy did in raising Jack's son with his (former) best friend as the dad for 15 years without telling him is something so cruel, I just couldn't get past it. Then her cavalier attitude about what she did just compounded the problem. Sorry, but this one is a real downer."
2,Unforgiveable heroine...,"The problem I have with this book is I can't forgive the heroine for her betrayal and so did not believe the hero would. She stole their child. She kept Jack from his son for 15 yrs. That is just not fixable in my opinion or forgiveable. To make matters worse, the heroine doesn't even have to earn his forgiveness. She just gives him an ultimatum and he gives in almost immediately. It's like he's just looking for more heartbreak from this extremely unscrupulous woman.The whole keeping the paternity of the baby a secret for years until the woman needs help or whatever is one of my least favorite romance themes. It seems to promote the idea that guys don't have any rights concerning their children. Most of these stories gloss over the woman's betrayal."
1,Not funny--that says it all,"When I hear there's a new Rachel Gibson novel coming out, I pre-order. I've been waiting for Daisy's Back in Town for months.What a disappointment. If this had been written by another author, one who is known for angst not humor, I might have given it more stars. But, Rachel, if you're going to take our money, we deserve a good story in return.In the second half, there were about 10-20 lines that reminded me of this terrific author's voice, but it wasn't enough to save the book.And, to the reviewer who suggested all the negative reviews are written by one person, get over it. If you liked the book, fine. But many of us obviously didn't.Go back to Ms. Gibson's earlier titles. They are wonderful. I'm going to toss this one and try the funny ones again."
2,She's not a heroine !!,"I have always loved Rachel Gibson's books, but this one... Is really disappointing and boring. Daisy is a really selfish person, and I think what she did to Jack keeping his son from him for 15 years is something... criminal ! I hated her and I thing she didn't deserve Jack's forgiveness. She is the worst kind of woman. And marry Jack's best friend Steve because it was more safe ? He was more rich, more mature ? Come on ! I hated her dead husband too ! I put this book whit my files for really, really bad books. I'm waiting for her next book , because I known she is a great writer, much better than this one."
2,Once was enough...,"The book was a decent Tom Peters style book to get you pumped up about your ideas. However, why re-release a book with a different name? Also, what happened to the other two books that were supposed to be added to the Jump Start theme? I would rank this book along side the Crystal Pepsi idea he had."
3,Nice product,Nice product but does not glow in the dark as it says. But it is a nice garden feature.
1,Not weather proof,"Bought this and only had it for one season. The cold weather cracks and break these.. not very durable for outside, yet they are made for outside. Very disappointed."
2,"Pretty, but...","It's a gorgeous birdbath...looks great in my yard. It's smaller than I expected, but again, it's pretty, so I can get over the size. But I bought it because it's supposed to glow in the dark. It doesn't. At all. So I'm giving it two stars because hey, at least it looks good during the day..."
2,Not sure what to think,"I bought this for my mother and had it sent directly to her. She said it arrived in good condition, and she put it in her back yard. A day or two later, she noticed that it had broken clean in half, with half of the glass lying on the ground. No one goes into her back yard except her and her little dog, so I don't think anyone vandalized it. I notified Amazon, and a replacement was mailed immediately. It, too, arrived in good condition, but my mother plans to store it until next year, so I will have to wait until then to see if the replacement is also defective. I would be wary of this product."
2,disappointed also,"I echo the thoughts of ""Disappointed's"" review. It's really pretty, a bit small but that's OK. Same problem with mine - the glue or solder didn't last more than 6 months and I found the bowl on the ground. I ended up putting the bowl in a hanging metal plant basket. It works well enough, but not as I'd hoped."
1,"Garbage, broke immediately","The pole snapped when I put it in the ground, and when I attempted to screw the glass top on, the bottom half of the glass broke."
3,Blue Birdbath,"It's a very pretty ornament for my garden, but too small to be practical. Should have paid more attention to the size before ordering."
3,"Thorough, but somewhat disappointing","I was greatly looking forward to reading this book, but, like another reviewer, found it rather slow going. Bach gives a very thorough chronicle of Hart's life, including details about every production, but somehow the essence of Hart didn't come through for me until the last few chapters. Despite Bach's repeated statements that Hart was charming, amusing, full of joie de vivre, etc., I didn't find much to illustrate that. I guess I was hoping for more examples from his work, more quotes from people who knew him personally, etc. I suspect that Kitty Carlisle Hart's refusal to cooperate meant that several of the people closest to the Harts also declined to be interviewed.The book does pick up steam in the final quarter,when Bach discusses Hart's involvement with ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Camelot."" Even so, I thought that Alan Jay Lerner's 10-odd pages on Hart in his memoir (""The Street Where I Live"")did more to really bring the man alive."
3,Don't buy from this seller,"I order this product all the time and love it but when I ordered it from (health and beauty) it was another story first of all the picture they show is the big toppik but when you get it,the items the smaller toppik,secondly there was a lot less fibers than I usually get in the smaller ones I ran out faster, usually a smaller toppik last a month but this one lasted only two weeks.Be careful with this seller."
2,Topik Hair Building Fibers,The product does cover but it's very messy. You have to be careful because it leaves a residue on clothes and furniture.
2,Can't say it made a difference,"I still have plenty of hair so I just wanted this to cover up a small area beginning to show. Keep in mind this is black black, there are no dark brownish fibers in it so unless you have jet black hair, this will look weird. But honestly, I couldn't get it to cover up much of anything...and I hardly have anything to cover up. Good luck if you actually have bald or almost bald spots. I have seen the videos and maybe they just used the whole canister each time in order to get enough on your head to cover something but I couldn't get much coverage."
5,No wonder Steve Malkmus hangs out with these guys....,"One part Pixies, one part Pavement, add a little Nirvana and what do you get? The best alternative guitar rock debut since Nevermind. Caesar will blow your mind........"
3,"Pleasantly readable, but not gripping","This book details several journeys to, and attempts to climb, Sepu Kangri. The chapters are written alternately by Bonington and Clarke, both of whom write engagingly. The alternation of voices keeps the narrative moving. However, I found the book somewhat slow, because much of it concerns the problems of Third World travel, plumbing (or lack thereof) and medicine rather than actual climbing. Readers who are non-climbers, though, may well find this lack of focus on technical mountaineering to be a plus. One certainly does get a good picture of what Tibet and its people are like today. Perhaps one of the book's best features is the lovely photography of some very striking peaks."
3,Tibet's Secret Mountain: The Triumph of Sepu Kangri,"After a slow start, where the history of the Sepu Kangri area in Tibet was discussed, the pace picked up as Clarke and Bonington described their intial reconnaissance looking for a way to the mountain and a possible climbing route. The joy of roaming across terrain, essentially unchanged for hundreds of years, comes across in the narrative. I enjoyed reading about their discoveries and meeting the local Tibetan people. The story of the climbs themselves in two different years are not as detailed as in other climbing books, but a feeling for what it was like comes across. It definitely is from a perspective of a sixty-plus year old, yet I can only hope that I am as adventurous and physically able to roam the earth's wild places as Bonington and Clarke still do. The book is similar to Bonington's other books in style. There is no fast-paced, heart stopping, climbing action; but it's a story that I could imagine myself being a part of."
4,Bright and relatively comfortable,I have been wearing these for a few months now and find them very helpful. I often run right around dusk and have noticed that I feel like cars are noticing me quicker than they did before I started wearing them. I also have theRoad ID - High Visibility Reflective Beltthat I often wear in conjunction with these and find them to be a good combination for running comfortably and feeling like cars are noticing me when I run.
1,Criticism of Taoist Scholarship,"I bought this book because it had great reviews and it's hard to find good material on the practices and texts of Taoism beyond the level of Tao of Pooh and Taoism for Dummies. But upon reading this torture of a text I found the other reviewers must have had different interests than mine, for what I've found in the book is a state-of-the-union address on Taoist scholarship (mainly how 19th and 20th century translators have not taken into consideration this or that text or aspect of Chinese history) but as to a rigorous explanation of the different practices and beliefs of Taoists there is not much to go on in this book. The author seems more interested in showing off his scholarship of Chinese thought and presenting what Taoism IS NOT than of telling us what those texts he so profusely cites say about what Taoism IS."
5,Fun for babies,My 8-month old son loves these toys. We roll the balls and he crawls everywhere to get them. He loves putting the turtles in his mouth (the balls come off the top). They are well-made and a great purchase!
4,Great toys - a little smaller than expected,"Love the toys, they're great fun. But they're a little smaller than I expected. The large ball is about 1.5"" in diameter (I was picturing more like 2.5"" to 3""). Other than that, they're great."
2,balls can be dangerous,"I thought these turtles were so cute, and love HABA products, so I was excited when my son received them. I was disappointed to find out the balls are not attached, so they often get separated from the base, but most of all, the balls are very hard wood, and when my baby throws them, they are very dangerous to other children and breakables. I ended up throwing away the balls(as they were always being throw), and just keeping the turtle base, but not as cute, or fun."
5,Very Cool Little Turtles,"These little turtles consist of a base with a perfectly smooth ball that can be removed and played with seperately, or set atop the turtles and spun backward to make the turtle go flying forward.We bought these for our daughter's first birthday. While she is definitely too young to roll the turtles, she loves the little balls. They are just perfect for her hands and such a satisfying weight and smooth texture!We know that eventually the turtles will catch on, and she and her older sister can race them.All in all, a great and versatile toy. Well-made and worth buying!"
5,Wonderful!!,"Buy these turtles! And don't wait until your child is 1 1/2, these are great for little babies too. My 7 month old loves them. They won't learn the strategy of making them roll across the floor until older, but the ball is the perfect size for babies hands to grasp. My son loves to hit the ball against the turtle body.My husband and I play with these more than Diedrich does.. :)I love all of my haba toys. So nice to buy something non-toxic and high quality - these will last for a long, long time"
5,definitely useful,"much more durable than the one you get for a $1, both are useful and if you can't afford this one buy the $1 it works just as good, this one is just more durable, it can handle more folding, more abuse than the little sister one, but both are great at holding in heat..."
2,Not Very Reflective,"This blanket is light and durable and seems to be well made. The non-reflective side is similar to a tarp, and the reflective side is a textured reflective material. However, it does not reflect heat nearly as much as the usual thin, non-durable space blanket."
3,haven't used it yet,i brought this for my mom who travelsno complainswould use a small throw blanket with thisvery compact
3,"good product, obscene name","This product works well for toning the skin, but the name is horrifying. Obviously, Estee Lauder marketing did not do enough research into what the term, ""throat lotion"", means in the urban vernacular."
4,The Wisdom of Florence Scovel Shinn,I bought it for a gift. I had read it many times. It is easy to read and very wise.
5,You won't live life the same way after this book.....,"This book gladdened my heart from the moment I read it. Since then, I have given a copy to several friends and they still thank me to this day.This is one wise, ahead-of-her-time lady and I thank Florence from the bottom of my soul for writing this book!Her words are changing lives for generations....'Look with wonder at that which is before you'."
5,A MUST FOR A STUDENTS OF METAPHYSICS,"Florence Shinn was an enlightened soul before it was fashionable. Her books reconfirmed that, what I am enduring during this transition into spiritual maturity is right on track. Each of us has inherent knowledge of what our ""divine design"" is, Florence Shinn's books are simply tools inspired by God to remind us of our ""goodness."" A definite illumination during the darkest of days!!!"
2,avoid exept,If you want to listen to the decadance of greek music buy it.It is a good example of that kind of music.(indian-greek)At least has some good melodies.
5,Another great one!,It's been a while since Michael has released an album and this one definitely doesn't dissapoint! If you like his previous albums you'll love this one.
4,Great,"The book teaches great Basic skills, as a first year soccer player I learned a lot. But it's old, all the pictures are B/W, and filled with long-haired British boys from the 70th. It is a small and easy book, but took me a long time to learn--you need to practice on fields a lot. If you are like me who know nothing about soccer but want to be the next-superstar ethlet, this is a good starting point."
4,A Really Good Read,"This is, I think, a very good read. It has the right mix of the realistic and the fantastical. As well as introducing the reader to the shady underworld of the occult, the author also takes us on a tour of some of Europe's most beautiful cities; gives us a view of two very different families and ways of life and allows us to dip into the work of the great Italian poet Dante.What else could be better for us as young readers? This author has shown a great deal of respect and knowledge for his audience in this educational yet gripping book. I hope that there is more of the same coming soon."
2,Typos distracted me from the plot,"This was an OK read--though rather confusing plot twists and did not seem to be written for a YA crowd. At times, the book was too heavy and dense and at other times too trite in tone. This book could use a serious edit from a real editor not just someone who thinks he's an editor. But what really bugged me about this book was that there were too many typos! It's distracting from the plot! You would think any legitimate publisher would hire a good proofreader to make sure no typos. If I didn't know better, I would have thought the author and his family published this book in their basement."
5,Focus upon the relationship,"This book takes a solid look at the importance of relationships to enhance your appreciation for others and foster your creativity. We often believe that we understand the principles behind trust and relationships. However, the difficulty is in truly living these principles day-in and day-out. Further, we are challenged in helping our colleagues develop their trust levels with others. This book offers sound practical advice to overcome these difficulties and challenges so that we ultimately grow ourselves relative to long-term sustained relationships."
3,Worth skimming.,This is one of those business books that addresses the obvious and contains a few useful spins on ideas. Few business books do more. A few thoughts in this book relate especially well (though unintentionally) to website-based interactions.
4,Heartfelt....,"Gives a good flavor of the possible parameters of a pilgrimage to the Holy Mountain. Sometimes I wished for a bit more user-friendly organization, and the text could have used some carefully chosen photographs. However, nothing can take away from the obvious merits of this well-written and heartfelt memoir of a journey into faith and prayer."
3,Could be better,"Although useful as another account of a pilgrim's journies on the Holy Mountain, I found it a bit disjointed and dull. Others I know have really enjoyed it much more than myself, and the content is factual and at times edifying. I would suggest that readers also read Markides' ""The Mountain of Silence"" for a better, if not more exotic and spiritual, account of the best that Athos has to offer."
1,"Worked for a while, but less than a month paper jam ALL THE TIME","Like the other poster said, 1 star is TOO GENEROUS.I dont even know what it wants, I bought cheap paper at first coz I print useless stuff like lyrics and memos. SO i bought expensive paper and it still says paper jam. I want to cry right now. I just wasted 40 bucks on something I really wanna beat up with a hammer or run over w/ a truck. I am not sure if I can still return it and I am afraid of selling it.Please dont buy it. It was a shame that I didnt check reviews prior to purchase, I really trusted HP."
4,VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRINTER SO FAR...,"I recently bought this printer for basic printing needs. I am very pleased with it so far. I don't find it to be too noisy, it prints good quality. I dont recommend it for pictures/photos but for your basic printing needs its a good buy. I don't find the ink to be too expensive. It is by far much cheaper than the lexmark ink I used to have to by for my lexmark printer(junk). But if you want an inexpensive printer for your basic printing needs I would recommend this one, and for less than $50, well you really can't go wrong. Don't let the bad reviews steer you away from this printer. Its a good basic printer."
3,"Decent, inexpensive printer","I purchased this printer to replace an inexpensive Epson inkjet. Because of its bad reviews, I had low expectations. I have to admit that I was happily surprised. Print quality is good, and the speed is decent. Initially it was VERY loud and VERY slow to ""think"", but whatever that was seems to have gone away after the first couple of print jobs.It is true that the ink cartridges are smaller. I think that's a plus. I live in a hot climate, and with the Epson I kept having to replace the ink because it dried out after sitting for a week or two without printing. The ink was double the price of these HP cartridges - and there were 4 of them! (I actually purchased this printer out of frustration because it was cheaper to replace the whole thing than to replace the Epson ink!)This little printer is great for what it is - a basic, cheap, easy-to-use inkjet for people with low-volume print needs."
1,Very Poor - Do Not Buy,"Printer purchased one year ago. In addition to paper jams, the black ink cartridge has not lasted more than 2 months, less than 100 pages. Print quality is horrible. Lines are skipped and some lines appear to be in bold and others not. Usually this means it is time to change the black ink cartridge. It is hard to believe that printing on the most economical setting still requires 6 ink cartridges per year. My experience with this printer has affected my opinion of HP printers. I do not expect to ever buy this brand again."
1,Piece of junk,"This thing has so many paper feed problems it's not even funny. When you try to print something it'll make a grinding noise and then just sit there with a blinking light, frustrating me to no end. Avoid buying this printer if you can!"
1,"Cheap, dysfunctional piece of junk",One star is far too generous. Noisy pile of garbage jams so consistently that I can't even tell how well it prints. Going back to the store today.
1,Avoid this printer like the Plague!,"I, as many others, was wooed by this printer due to its insanely low price. But unfortunately, that age-old saying is true: ""you get what you pay for"". It was great for a few days, with only the occasional paper jam, but after about a week... I cannot get a page to successfully load into the printer! If there are more than 5 pages in the tray, it takes all of the pages at once - and if there are less than 5 pages, it usually doesn't take anything. I feel deceived by HP!"
5,Don't listen to ignorant people,"I bought this printer two years ago, and i Have printed Hundreds of pages with it. SomeTimes I download E-books and I don't like to read them on the PC,so I Print Them (usually 250 pages per book), and I never had any problem of running out of ink, because if you put the printer settings in ""fast draft "", the quality is Excellent and It takes about 5 sec per page.Don't listen to people like the reviewer Zachary Walker that says that this printer(all 3940 printers) has this or that problem,just because HIS 3940 has that problem due to defect or because his Pc is full of Spyware, or because he doesn't know how to use a printer.Excellent Printer; printed almost 350 pages in a row(fast draft) without using the whole cartridge.I have already printed 5 Books(~1300 Pags and many more word documents) and I only Bought 2 cartridges besides the ones that comes with the printer."
1,HP3940 Printer: A Piece of Junk,"This printer is a piece of junk. It repeatedly jams, declares low ink levels for full cartridges, and creates very poor quality printing even when it does work. Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs. The only reason I gave this thing one star was that I couldn't give it no stars. A typical HP printer, it's only another way for them to suck up money from you for their overpriced ink jet cartridges."
2,Pretty boring stuff.,"enough said. My favorite was Andrew York's Sunburst, but a better value would be to buy the Mel Bay Andrew York DVD. This DVD is just a sampler compilation of previous Mel Bay releases. Not worth it for me."
4,Ska Roots,"This is early Jamaican Ska. If you insist on your Ska having heavy doses of Punk and/or New Wave in it, forget this albumn. This is Ska before it was popular in Europe or the US."
1,She would have hated this.,"This single and the ""Remember Me"" album is nothing short of a shameless attempt to cash in, I simply cannot believe that she would have sanctioned this album were she alive. The ""producers "" and I use that word loosely, have added disco beats to her unfinished songs and tried to cash in - if you are not a huge fan then I implore you do not buy this or the album, they should be ashamed of themselves. Whats so sad is that her vocals on the Abba track Winner takes it all are fab - I have never heard anyone able to do Abba songs except Abba until now - only problem is that darn disco beat they have added after - simply awful."
1,a terrible injustice for a final single release,"The Challenge does not get a remix on this single. It's just the radio edit and the full length album version From ""Remember Me."" And this remix of Self Control is the WORST quality. It sounds like a really bad bootleg done in a basement. The vocals are completely washed out, and it sounds as if the record was used to supply vocal for a mix that someone created on their home system. I'm warning you, unless you are that diehard a fan, you are NOT going to be happy with this (I am a diehard, and I'm really unhappy). Pick up the Self Control 2004 maxi-single and you'll be good to go."
2,What went wrong?,"I loved Laura Branigan. Loved her voice and her music. I was devistated when I heard she had died. I was estatic when I heard that at least there was a little bit of new music to come out. I was again devistated when I heard it. I'm so sorry to say that this is crappy. It's terrible. Even if she hadn't died, this wouldn't have saved her career. Sorry Laura, this is bad. A massive departure from her best work."
4,Seller provided exactly what he advertised,"The seller was great five stars*****. He promptly shipped the camera and it was in almost new condition as promised. I was really impressed with the seller.This is an older camera, but I had one in the past and it died. I took some really great pics with it. Even though I have two new Nikon cameras that are much better is most respects, I always got great pics with this camera. When I go out for pics, I use all three cameras and choose the best shots."
2,Crash and burn,"It takes pretty good pictures but it's slower than Jake's dog. Press the shutter release after a lengthy auto focus and wait awhile for it to 'click'. Then wait some more while it saves the picture (it shows a message asking you if you want to delete it, a play to make you believe it's waiting on YOU.) The only plus I can think of right now is the 8X optical zoom.Now it doesn't want to do anything, pretty much. In the docking port it shows that it's on aux power and won't recharge the batteries. The lens comes out but a get a multitude of different actions: red light flashing, lcd screen won't come on, no battery charge indicator because the first screen won't stay on long enough, etc., etc. Even the diagnostic test (hold the flash button and turn on the camera) doesn't work anymore. I guess it's just a boat anchor now unless someone has a better suggestion.I think I'll just go top notch and buy a GOOD camera, like a Nikon D2x!!"
1,It died !,"Just received the HP 945. It took 8 great pictures and then locked up, cannot shut it off. I am deciding whether to return it, or have HP replace it. Probably return it, this is the first AND last HP camera I will own."
2,"Great features, but problem with some images","While having great features, the camera seems to suffer a serious flaw: Some pics have Horizontal lines which ruin the pics. I've seen other reports of the same flaw, some indicating and exchange from HP support might help. Yet, HP support does not acknowledge any problem (offered an exchange, but would not say if that fixes anything or acknowledge others reported the same problem). Watch for this and be aware before purchasing this camera. I'd wait for the next version or go with another brand."
1,peice of junk,"I too got took on this one. Looked great, had lots of features. Got it for my birthday what a waste of money. I bet I didn't take 50 pictures with it before it died. I also bought all the extras that went along with it. Got a lot of money tied up in this camera and can't get hp to fix it or anything. All they wanted me to do was buy another hp camera and waste more money. HP can't make cameras they better stick to computers. If you buy one of these cameras it will work fine for a while then (bam) it's dead without warning. There may be a few out there still working. If so you are one of the lucky ones to have a working one. I will never buy an hp camera."
1,The Best,I had many camera in the past but none of them can compare to the HP Photo 945 5.3MP.the best camera ever.
3,Great Pics with Some Problems,"I have owned this camera for over 3 years. Picture quality is amazing,particularly if you are into landscapes. True colors are obtainable in any light if you know how to adjust the manual tuning features. My main gripe is the periodic shutting down of the camera . It occasionally locks up with lens out or just turns itself off. When this happens you need to remove the batteries and replace or simply turn it back on. Lag time for shutter action from button push is too slow but average for this level of camera and price. Lithium batteries last a reasonable amount of time for this size of device. Re-chargeable batteries last about "" 15 mintues"" it seems."
3,Another stuck lens on the HP 945 Photosmart,"I admit, I bought my HP 945 Photosmart digital camera used, and I got a great deal on it...but after 4 months and hundreds of photos (very good quality, I might add), the lens stuck. Attempts to release it resulted in sickening grinding and whirring noises. After loving this camera, getting to know it and taking some terrific vacation photos with it, it pooped out. Reading other's reviews of HP's lousy customer service does nothing to elevate my spirits. No, I think I'll take my money elsewhere and invest in a camera with a warranty. In the meantime, I've happily gone back to my old and VERY reliable Canon AE-1!"
4,Kim Blake,"I also own an hp photosmart 945 camera. I've owned it for 2 years. Unfortunately I dropped it and my color got messed up. I called hp customer service to see if it could be fixed and the same thing happened to me that happened to others, they tried to sell me an upgraded camera. I was very disappointed in hp for not repairing my camera that cost me $500. I love the camera and have been very pleased with it. I've taken beautiful pictures with it, but I'd prefer to have it fixed than buy another one. I feel like hp doesn't care about it's customers, all they're doing is selling cameras. As I said earlier, I'm very disappointed with hp's customer service!Kim"
1,bad purchase,"my employer purchased this camera for our staff to use. After 6 months the picture color screwed up and was taking pictures with green and purple hues. finally it gave out and HP sent us a new one (same model) well 6 months later, same old problems. i'm going to recommend to my boss that we spend a little more money in hopes of getting a better quality camera. this camera is a waste of money and is discontinued now i believe."
3,Great picture with a Very very good quality.,"Unfortunately once I got used to that the lens motor stopped working and is stuck in the out position. and they cannot fix that problem because the HP/Hewlett-Packard PhotoSmart 945 5.3-MegaPixel Digital Camera has been discontinued.don't buy it, you'll love me!"
3,ok for regualr everyday shots,"I have probloms with getting indoor shots w/o the flash on. If I keep the flash off, all shots come out blury. And in museums or public places having the flash on isnt allowed, causing me too lose some good pictures. However, when I take outdoor pictures or use the flash indoors, they come out great; if I can hold the camera straight enough to get the shot. I love using the black and white, sepia features. great focous, has three second delay to shoot. Overall; good for childrens b-day parties or regular use where you wont get upset losing a few shots. In that case theres plenty of cheaper camera that have the same quality. The professionals are recomendin kodaic products in the digitals. I bought mine at another retailer w/ only a thirty day return policy and couldnt return it to upgrade."
2,Too Slow....,"We were very unhappy with the performance of this camera. The shutter speed was very slow, and the photos were often blurry as a result - you really need a tripod with this one. It's a bit bulky and has a lightweight feel to it. We sent it back..."
1,Don't make a mistake and purchase this camera.,"The camera took good pictures, but after 21 months of use the camera has a hardware malfunction (lens sticks and camera will not fully turn on). Choose another company that is known for quality cameras. We did not use this camera regularly. This is a product failure and I hope this saves someone else from making the mistake we made in purchasing the HP945."
1,This is a dog!,"I bought this camera and spent weeks trying to get it to take a decent picture. I had previously used an Olympus which was an excellent camera.The HP will not tolerate even slight movement in the AUTO mode, and the quality of the photos is poor. I complained to HP and they sent me a replacement. The replacement was no better.You had best avoid this camera and I will never again buy any HP camera product."
2,SAVE $ BUY THE HP 707,"AFTER SPENDING $ 500 BUCKS MY CAMERA STRAP CAME OFF AND THE ZOOM MOTOR BUSTED! I found out through the camera guy at Costco that they stopped selling them because "" THEY R JUNK "" IM NOT KIDDING THAT IS WHAT HE SAID.Now I don't agree but you get so much more from the 707 because it has biult in MEMORY ! as well as plenty of zoom, it is so much more durrable to( hard metal! not plastic shell) I picked one up in the box and I am verry happy w/ the results I get from the H.P. 707............BOTTOM LINE the 945 looks so much more like an s.l.r. but it's too bulky and cumbersome.........the 707 fits in your pocket too and so you don't have to lugg it around your neck lookin like a TOURIST !!!"
1,Photosmart 945 is unreliable.,I have owned this camera for a year and it has malfunctioned twice requiring it to be replaced with a refurbished camera. It's autofocus function does not take clear pictures consistently. My son's Canon takes much better pitures. I would not recommend this camera to anyone.
1,PLEASE DON'T FOLLOW THIS MAN...,"My heart breaks for all the people deceived by Harold Camping. People with weak consciences afraid that if they question a man they will be guilty of disbelief in God. They forgot the admonition ""beware of false teachers"" Not only has he robbed them of their money but even worse the love of God and assurance of salvation. ""greater love has no man than this than a man lays down his life for his friends"" Thank you Yeshua that you would call me friend."
2,Unit slips down and then out of ear.,"Was there a ear-clip which came with this unit?My unit seems to just have a rubber ball-type seal which slides into my ear. Problem is, about a minute after putting the unit in my ear snugly, it start creeping down, the slips out of my ear. I believe this is due to the weight of the mic arm which wants to fall down due to gravity.I looked in the box for a wrap-around ear holder but could not find this. Seems like this is missing part to this unit.The sound quality is OK, but can sound garbled at any volume. So far the mic seems to work fine, haven't had any complaint from callers on that. Not sure this unit worth the price IMHO."
2,maybe good for a very young bride (no older than 23),"The author writes well (which is a big plus) but it seemed she was writing for a very immature, very young bride. All her talk about a bride formally ""leaving"" her mother, her father, her ""maidenhood"" -- all seems silly to a 34 year old engaged woman like myself. What women my age (friends) leave behind (if anything) is singlehood and all the freedom, independence and potential loneliness in that. What astounded me was that the author interverviewed many ""older"" brides -- older even than me -- who identified with these themes of leaving one's mother/father/family/maidenhood. If you are young and getting married - especially if you've never lived away from home or have only done so for college -- this book might be for you. If you have spent time living as a single, self-supporting woman and feel you identify most strongly as a single person (versus a daughter or a ""maiden""), this book is not for you."
3,"A Negative Read, areeves","My mother saw this book on Oprah and bought this book for me shortly after I had become engaged. Her intentions we're for all the best, however I found that this has been a mostly negative reading about how one feels prior to getting married.I enjoyed reading about how other women have felt prior to getting married, however most of the opinions we're negative.This book does give a good insight to beyond the ""wedding planning"" and actually the marriage itself, which could be helpful for many young women getting married these days. I just wish that the author could have been a little more positive about such a happy event."
1,Waste of time and money,"This book is ridiculous. It has nothing to do with being ""conscious."" Thankfully it only cost 50 cents (plus shipping), but it's no wonder that the used ones start at 1 cent."
1,DON'T BUY THIS AS AN ENGAGEMENT GIFT!,"After receiving this book as part of an engagement gift,I skimmed it with an open ear, only to find it highly negativeand rather insulting that someone would be so aloof as to give this to a bride-to-be that they hardly know! This is the type of self-help related book that only a bride, her mother or sister should purchase. I didn't ask for anyone to tell me about my true feelings, so please don't offer.I don't recommend it to anyone looking for a gift!"
2,"Not dreading your wedding, this book will disappoint","As an engaged woman of 27, I am finding that my fast-approaching wedding is straining some family and friend relationships. I wanted to learn more, and hoped this book would be my guide. But I have found Nissinen's approach to be too heavy -- depressing, really. She likens getting married to death and talks about our transition into married life as if it were a sacrifice we were all dreading. I understand her point, and think she is right to a small degree, but for me this book just doesn't fit the bill."
5,And I thought I was the only one...,"Getting that ring is amazing, but when the panic hit I thought I was doomed. A friend recommended this book, and I can't say enough about it. Nissinen speaks to all the fears and concerns all (or at least, this one!) brides experience but usually don't understand. A must-have for every bride-to-be. Put in on your shower wish-list!"
4,Helpful and insightful,"I found this book thought-provoking and helpful! I picked it out because I was hoping to get some clues as to how to deal with the stress of my engagement, but while reading it I found myself sinking further into introspection, which was actually really good. This book doesn't necessarily have answers, but it makes you ask yourself questions that you may not otherwise have asked. I plan to read it again, just to see what I discover the second time through!"
5,a gift every bride-to-be must have,"When a woman gets engaged there are lots of mixed emotions that she experiences. Most of them are not happy. Confused, she wonders whether she really loves this man? is she resisting marriage? does she really want to marry at all? or is it that she doesn't want to marry this person in particular. She fears that her married life is doomed because of all that she is feeling. No one stands up and tells her it's okay to feel sad and that her life ahead is not doomed. This book is the shoulder a bride-to-be may need to cry on, a friend who tells her that though it really hurts today, tomorrow you'll be fine, ready to be a conscious bride. it helps you become a conscious bride and marry the right person for the right reasons. read it, work with it and then read it again.."
4,helpful...,"The Conscious Bride was helpful for me, one month before our wedding. She has good insight to some of the things I was feeling and I was so relieved to know i wasn't crazy! Some of the book is a bit trite and other sections only scratch the surface of a topic, but overall, the insight was helpful and allowed me and my fiance to discuss some of the issues around getting married."
1,Not what I had hoped it would be...,"I really was looking forward to something that explored the emotional whirlwind that I have been going through. This was certainly not it. It touches on what I wanted and then veers off into mythologically-based new age nonsense (and I have nothing against new age stuff in general).If you are looking for a treatment of what weddings and marriage mean in the modern world, I recommend Kamy Wicoff's I Do But I Don't. I also hear that A Walk Down the Aisle is good. I'm ordering it now, and we'll see."
2,Disappointing,"I think the intent of this book is great. The wedding planning process, as well as transitioning into married life, is incredibly stressful and no one really talks about it. However, I found I could not relate to the whole psychoanalytical approach used in the book. I kept thinking, ""Well, maybe the next section will be helpful."" But it never was! Perhaps because of my age (39), I've already done more introspection than most brides and did not need validation that I'm not ""crazy,"" because of all the insanity surrounding the process. Some of the quotes from other brides were interesting, but the book was just too ""out there"" to be useful, at least for me."
2,Political and outdated,"This book was kinda strange. I was put off by the language which seemed to me to have very feminist undertones, and yet seemed to perpetuate gender inequality. E.g. it talked about women 'giving everything up' when they get married, but men gaining. I wouldn't reccommend it."
