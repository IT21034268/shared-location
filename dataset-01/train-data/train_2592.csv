1,A Jumbled Collection of Causual Notes - Not Suitable for Learning,"I don't know much about programming (after reading through this book!) but I thought one of the main qualities in a programmer was attention to detail. This isn't evident here.Surely another trait that should come naturally to programmers would be logic. This book has no logical progression. New concepts are discussed without any prior reference.The reader gets the impression that Predko certainly knows about the PIC micros, but couldn't care less about clear explanation. You will find yourself constantly having to refer to other sources of information every few pages, which soon makes you realise what a waste of time the whole book is.Look around for other books."
2,A book written in french,"If you want to confuse yourself in the text riddled with grammatical errors and typos. I didnt read this 1000 page book from the start to the end as I was irritated by trying to comprehend what the author wants to say. Mike, get a reviewer. Kudos on your design ideas though."
4,"Excellent Content, Poorly Edited.","Myke's complete grasp of the PIC Micro is readily seen in this book. He covers all aspects of using these chips in your embedded designs, from interfacing hardware and writing software in both assembly and upper level languages to the inner workings of these microcontrollers. However be prepared to read many paragraphs several times in order to grasp what he is saying as the editors did not help with Myke's English."
5,Great improvement,"Mr. Predko's first PIC book was a disappointment. At the time it came out it was the best book on the PIC, but unfortunately that was not saying a lot. The best feature of the book were the ""experiments"" and ""projects"", but the book was not very well structured and there seemed to be a lot of background information missing. What came through was that the author really knew his subject.The second edition of the book is a vast improvement, with much more in depth information and it is organized a lot better. The author again demonstrates that he knows the subject - in this edition he has communicated that knowledge in a much more concise and logical way. In terms of information, this book is so positively crammed with PIC technical information and suggestions that it seems a wonder that it is not larger."
2,Still has a long way to go.,"I bought this book primarily for the elcheapo programmer included. I followed all the instructions, looked past the inaccurate details, corrected them and then again with the updated version online (which is also inaccurate) I get to a step in the build/debug stage that states to email Myke (the Author)if the problem I'm having is encountered. Two weeks and three emails later and no reply. WHATS THE SECRET. Having read other reveiws on this book errors in text(also online and on the CD)have been a common complaint. If your just learning, how can you tell fact from fiction! If the rest of the book has as many errors as the elcheapo section it is going to be hard to trust anything you read here. Sorry Myke"
1,never received it,"Ordered this with two other books, and i never recieved. Tracking info just says i should have recieved 2 weeks ago. How do you call Amazon???"
2,Not Great... Needs work...,"OK... This is a book on PIC programming....So the first piece of code in the book is a ""Hello World"" program on page 19, WRITTEN in 8088 ASSEMBLER and C.So this is a book on PIC programming. The author did put some PIC code in, on page 25. But I am sure he could have picked something better than the basic code for an interrupt handler in c.This is not how to teach someone to program...I am sure that if you know how to program a PIC then the book makes sense. If not, stay away from this book."
4,Almost Perfect,My Chihuahua loves these. The only problem I have with them is that they crumble so badly 1/3 of the bag is crumbs. They are the consistency of shortbread and just can't handle being jumbled in a loose bag. I have bought 2 bags so far and both have been the same. My pup likes them so much I'm not really sure if I will buy them again or not.
3,If your dog likes this,My puppy is picky and has allergies. I feed him Evo food so I thought he'd like the cookies. They are not soft/chewy. They are biscuits and they don't smell like anything so puppy is not interested. They are really dry. Maybe you will have better luck with your dog than I did with mine.
3,Sparkle Magic Kingdom,"Essentially, this game is the Barbie version of Candy Land. I bought it as sort-of a gag gift for a 20 year-old friend of mine who loves getting new board games. The game is fun, but without the nostalgia of the original Candy Land, it isn't very memorable. Little girls will still like the copious amounts of Barbie and glitter, not to mention the free stickers. :)"
5,Worship,"This is so peaceful and relaxing...just let the Spirit rest your soul when it plays, or play it in the background of your business."
2,Overly Simplistic,"Overall, I found this book to be quite simplistic and shallow. There were a few worthwhile entries, but I would recommend looking for a different text if you would like more in-depth coverage of this field."
3,Solder Sucker,"Bought this for a tv repair project, having never used a solder sucker before. Seemed a little flimsy but what do you expect for $4.99. If I did jobs like this more often I'd spend a little more to get a better solder remover."
1,Solder Sucker Sucks In Other Ways,This is a cheaply made product and comes with no instructions. The threads on the cap are so poor that it takes considerable effort to line them up and screw the cap back on. I don't expect it to last long.
4,"For the price, I cannot complain","I have one of the heated bulb solder suckers from Radio Shack but I wanted something with a lower toolbox profile and that I didn't have to heat up (as I usually have the dedicated iron already warmed up when doing a project).This product works as advertised -- it sucks solder. I used it to clean up a couple of messy jobs I had did a while back and it worked well and did not clog.I don't think this product will last 20 years like some tools, but for the price it's well worth it."
1,Button stopped working after less than 10 uses,"The product looks nice, metal barrel, nice color.However the quality of the mechanism is very poor.The sliding barrel slides ok but not very smoothly.The trigger button which is supposed to lock the barrelstopped working after literally 10 uses and no longerlocks the barrel at all.Very disappointed - this product is going back."
1,Really does not work very well or at all,The tip is too large to get close enough to work area and then the suction does not seem to be great enough to do much of anything. I tried it repeatedly but never got it to work. I would not recommend it.
3,Ehh,It gets the job done I just have to keep recocking it sometimes in order for it to stay in the locked position.
3,for bigger jobs,It takes a bigger pool of solder than I have had so far for this to work properly. Would probably work great on large solder jobs.
3,"Works fine, I guess.","It does what you need it to, most of the time. It's just a bit of a hassle to operate."
4,Works OK,"Only used once.That is all I want to say, but these reviews require me to say more. I don't think more is necessary!"
4,Seems alright,"Just got mine last week and haven't had to actually use it yet. I tested the vacuum on mine right out of the box (finger over the nozzle and engaging the pump) and it seemed pretty strong. The blue portion (body) is all metal and solid. Also took it apart, the black cap on the end is plastic, so be careful when reinstalling the cap and I believe this pump could work well for any hobby/home bench for a good while. I've used other plunger-type pumps of better construction, but this a very decent pump for the price."
2,Limited Usefulness,"I've always wanted a good solder-sucker. I still do. This isn't it.It does pull up some solder, but never really seems to clean the joint enough to be able to easily pick the component off the board. For instance, a small fuse-holder I was trying to salvage from a single-sided PCB: I used a 140 watt Weller soldering gun (overkill) and heated the joint until solder was running off the board. While continuing to heat the joint, I placed the cocked sucker (no pun intended) against the tip of the gun and pressed the trigger. Some of the molten solder disappeared, but not nearly enough to free the part. After repeated tries, I had sucked up enough solder to let me remove the part with pliers, but enough remained to make it difficult. By that time, my thumb was tired from cocking the tool. One component.....Salvaging/removing other components from various types of boards convinced me that this tool was going to be of limited usefulness."
1,Bad Item,"This item ""sucks"", and not in the clever way. It literally fell apart. After about 2 or 3 uses, the 4th made it literally un-glue and pop open. As much as I loved lead solder being blown into the air I was breathing, I cannot say I would EVER recommend this item to anyone."
2,Cheap plastic casing,"The price was certainly right, but I decided to unscrew this thing to inspect the insides and the cheap plastic threads on the casing were already stripped, and unscrewing it permanently stripped them. It doesn't go back together. Didn't even get to use it once, and even if I had, cleaning it out would have been impossible without breaking it. Look for a higher quality product that isn't made of plastic."
1,Couldn't get it to work,"I've tried about 20 times and never had it suck any solder.I'm not very good at this, so I asked my friend who is an electrical engineer and builds circuit boards all the time, to try it. He tried several solder joints and never got it to suck anything. He has a different ""sucker"" that he says does work, but he is more a fan of solder wicks.I don't recommend this product."
2,Not a practical Solder Sucker- desoldering pump,Not a practical Solder Sucker- desoldering pump. I tried to use it without much success. I did read the instructions on the web as to how to use it but its really a practical joke to use such a tool. There are better tools out there to remove or desolder the solder.
4,Gets the job done!,"I got this pump in order to help me in removing two convergence chips from my big screen, with 18 solder points each. This was my first time to work in the confines of a printed circuit. It took only three or four points before I got the ""hang"" of using it. You need to keep the suction point as close as possible to the hot solder before you punch the button to vaccuum. In most points, it took only one try to get the point loose. I would reccommend."
1,I hate it!!!!!,It never works I've been throe bad solder suckers before but this has to bethe worst. I suggest not buying this product.
3,Useful for soldering projects,I used this for soldering on a motherboard from my laptop. It was useful for pulling the little bit of solder out. Probably better used on bigger jobs with more solder to remove.
2,You get what you pay for.,The solder sucker came with the blue plastic separated from the aluminum tube. The plastic threads were stripped and the two halves would not stay together. I used some JB Weld to permanently attach the two halves. After the repair the unit works ok.
2,No Go,To much recoil compared to others. Must put to much pressure on it so it doesn't bounce of the board and not create the vacuum.
4,Works Fine!,"Hey, I've used it a few times, worked fine, every time. For $5 bucks get one, throw it in your toolbox and if you need it, you'll have it!"
4,Solder Sucker,"Worked nicely. Heated solder to melting point. Positioned sucker right next to melted solder and pushed the suck button and walla, solder gone. My only concern was that the sucked up solder would be hard to clean out of unit. Not the case. Solder was easy to remove from sucker. Saved time and effort on my circuit boards."
3,Desoldering Pump,"It's a plain desoldering pump. Bigger than the one I used before (it's 8in long x 3/4in diameter). It's not real high quality, but it works well enough for occasional jobs; I just used it on an X box controller S. As another review said, the tip does get filled with solder, but I never had to open it to get it out; when I push the pin back down it clears the tip. Mine is navy blue with neon orange plastic (unlike the image on the product page) and made by Steren. The package specified that it's made of aluminum. Seems like it will last for a good long while."
4,Solder Sucker,This desoldering pump works as intended. It is good for general purpose desoldering however it is too bulky for desoldering smaller components. All in all it works good.
5,Cool tool.,I was actually afraid to order this tool after reading the wide vaiance of reviews about it. I can safely and honestly say that this toolworks perfectly if you closely follow the instrucions. One important fact that doesn't come across in the instructions are you must keep the tip of this tool touching the area of solder to be sucked up. As soon as the solder is flowing press the sucker button and it's gone.
2,Not as good as ones I've previously used,"This one works ok, but I found this pump to get clogged with hardened solder easier than other pumps I've used. Maybe mine has a defect or something but it seems that the suction isn't quite what it needs to be to get the solder all the way into the base. Instead it will sometimes get stuck in the rubber tip and after 4 or 5 joints will clog the tip up so the cleaner bar won't go all the way in and you have to take it apart and clean it out to do more."
2,not very effective,"I bought this one from Rat Shack since I needed a desoldering tool right away, but I wouldn't recommend it. It works, but just barely. Two reasons it's not good: the pump barrel just isn't large enough to move a sufficient volume of air to pick up enough solder. Also, when you release the plunger the pump ""recoil"" makes it hard to keep the tip on the work. Get the Edsyn Soldapullt Deluxe Desoldering Pump instead. It has a much larger barrel and doesn't suffer from the recoil problem."
2,Better than nothing,"First, I'm assuming this is the same sucker that Radio Shack sold - it sure looks the same. I was happy with it initially, because it was solidly made, and easier to use than a squeeze bulb type. However, once I got my hands on an Edsyn DS017 Soldapullt, I thought differently. The DS017 creates a stronger vacuum and moves more air, so is much more effective removing solder. I'd advise spending the extra $15 for the real thing."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I knew this product would be fairly cheap, but it broke after one use. The top half of the Solder Sucker is plastic and it threads into a metal bottom half. This connection point is bad and it just breaks apart. I guess I can just tape it together. I don't understand why they don't just make the entire thing plastic."
1,Crap,"Do not buy this. I recieved this today, took it out of the package and after 10 minutes of normal use the microscopic plastic threads gave out. Horrible design, how anybody would think that putting tiny plastic threads on a fitting which is supposed to hold a spring in place excapes me... asides from falling apart after 10 minutes it jams up ALL the time... I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!"
2,Not for laptop motherboards!,"I got this product thinking it was good enough for sucking the solder from the power jack of a laptop I have. Boy, was I wrong. First off, the tip is huge and you have to quickly get in there while the solder is still hot n soft or you missed your chance and have to reload and try try again. It can get really aggravating - seriously. In order to make this product work for me, I got a pair of pliers and pinched the tip to my desired width/etc. until I could do what I want with it. NOt a long term product - short term; a throw-away item at best. Luckily, I was only off 4 bucks with s&h and all."
1,Same as Radioshack? Don't buy it.,"This looks like the same junk that Radioshack sells (Model: 64-2098). If that's the case, then don't waste your money. As with many bad products, a critical component is designed, it seems, to fail quickly. In this case the release mechanism is made of cheesy plastic and has five or six shallow threads that screw into the metal barrel (see photo). Brilliant! Let's see . . . where is the most stress going to be? Of course the threads strip out after a few uses. Besides, solder wick works much better in most cases."
1,Product suck...not literally,"I bought this cause it was cheap and figured it did a better job than paper towels. After soldering a very tiny piece to a laptop, it didn't work at all. Maybe the place to suck the solder was too small for it. Maybe there wasn't enough solder for it to suck up. I don't know. All I do know is that to try and use it was a pain. You have to hold the soldering iron in one hand, the part in your other, and that leaves two fingers to use this product. Not to mention that when it ""sucks"" it's got some nasty kickback, like firing a gun.I would not purchase this unit. Spend the extra money and get one that works, isn't a trigger based unit, and can be held with something other than your hand. As I said, maybe the conditions were wrong or I don't know what I'm doing, but this caused more problems than it helped...It just didn't work."
3,thanks for companys like this one in Amazon.,"wanted to share my experience with this company, in terms of costumer service attitude which was an exelent one, that stand for being there for us, the costumers, which is the most important thong in any company you dealing with."
5,I loved this book,"Charming, actually touching in some parts and laugh out loud in othersJerry Hall is a geninue unique American character - and a very funny, no BS woman"
2,Jerry Hall's Tal Tales,"Although I enjoyed the book very much, it was not in the condition that I expected. It was listed as good condition. The book had stained pages, smelled bad, and had something sticky on the back cover."
2,All the same,"Reading the back cover of this book, I expected an intriguing and exciting collection of short stories focusing on people in extraordinary situations- it promises stories of fire-eaters, trapeze artists, and Marie Curie's cleaning lady, among others.After the first few stories, however, it became clear to me that the author had in mind a few stock plot turns that she somehow incorporated into almost every story. Yes, the settings and characters differ, but nearly each story has one of two endings. Although it is commonly accepted that there are certain elements present in most stories , this book takes the common elements to an extreme. Perhaps if one were to read one or two of these stories, they might be more enjoyable. Twelve, however, is too many."
1,There is a reason this book was $3.99,It is awful. A bunch of sad stories that do not make much sense (Rat Stories? Come on). If this book could hold its own weight it wouldn't need to ride the coat tails of Memory Keepers Daughter.
2,Fire King wet blanket,This book was a huge disappointment. After reading her best seller I thought this book would be better.
4,not enough to say (if said very well),"If this book had been shy a few stories I would have given it 5 stars. Edwards writes well. The way she sequences words is often described as ""exquisite"" or something, but ultimately I got tired of her narrative voice and I think she ran out of material. Does a collection really need two stories featuring the poisonous effects of radium, unexpected at the time of its discovery? I highly recommend these: ""Falling"", ""Spring, Mountain, Sea"", ""Chain of Being""; also good are ""Balance"" and ""Fire King."" ""The Invitation"" has a clever premise but wound up in the air (according to me). The rest, well... Ho hum. I was lucky enough to spend some time in peninsular Malaysia and Borneo but the stories concerned with that area got repetitive. Pet peeve: I wish these stories featured fewer ""shafts of light."" BTW, I subsequently found out that the stories I liked all seem to be freely available on [...]."
3,Ease of purchase..,"I purchased these decoys for a relative out of state, they were delivered on time and the recipient was quite happy."
2,Filled with errors,"This has been a great reference book for years, but hasn't been getting better, instead getting filled with more and more errors. The new 'Fiesta, Harlequin, and Kitchen Kraft Dinnerwares: The Homer Laughlin China Collectors Association' book has more detailed and better pictures than any other book. I'd buy them both, but use this one the least."
2,A jumbled up mess,"One of worst of the newer ""collector"" books out there. There isn't even a color chart with the names, you need to deduce them by flipping through all the pages and guessing at collections of variuos colors and doing a process of elimination. Fakes are mentioned, and the author says ""you'll know them when you see them"". Thanks alot! All the marks aren't even listed. What about newer peices versus old?Some Encyclopedia, more like ramblings of a collector. The medium green issue is already covered by others, the book mentions it everywhere but gives very little evidence of it (maybe the author has medium green envy?).Not worth the bargain price spent on it. Certainly not a reference book.p.s. I give other collector books 5 stars, so I'm not just a grump."
4,Huxford's Fiesta 10th Edition,"I just received the 10th edition copy of Collector's Encyclopedia of Fiesta, and other related items. The new layout and design are exactly what this edition needed to set it out above the previous ones. It seems the forward is a bit lengthy. Each page is framed in the turquoise color. The new pictures are numerous!! And for those who collect New Fiesta (produced since 1986, the pages for this are expanded to include up thru Scarlet and quite a few of the pieces produced thus far in color pictures. I rate this book at 4 stars for one reason. I feel the prices are inflated and out of line. Yes, there will always be some ""rare"" items at high prices. There are a fair share of pictures that are the same as previous books as well."
3,collectors encyclopedia of Fiesta,"Disappointed in the book as I was expecting information on the ""old, original"" fiesta ware. instead its mostly about the reproductions and new fiesta that is on the market. The book is beautifully done and the colors are amazing, but the content leaves alot to be desired."
4,"Not bad, but could be better.","This is about the most comprehensive and accurate book on Fiestaware currently on the market. However, this updated version could have included NEW as opposed to UPDATED materials. While much of the text, most photos, and the price listings have been updated, there is still a plethera of information about rare Fiestaware that the authors had time to add since publishing the previous edition. With feedback and photos that the authors have claimed to receive since publishing the last version, I expected more of the new material to be part of the book. All in all, you could not find a better book on the market, although I hesitate in calling in a ""bible""."
1,Not worth it at all,"Received 2 of these boppers after reading great reviews. First, they did not match the items in the picture. Second, my 14 months olds looked at them and then threw them aside. They do absolutely nothing but float. The characters inside are so small, you could barely see them. A complete waste of money and space."
5,Peaceful,"This CD is like nothing I have ever heard. It is great to meditate with, or just relax with. It is so peaceful, it is so soothing and healing at the same time."
3,"Promising Title, Low Delivery","The authors do much to cover topics such as battery and motor to computer interfaces. However, they actually drop the ball when it comes to covering actual drive train assemblies. It is true that robots utilizing wheels would benefit from this book, if you are consider build a droid that uses either legs or treads/tracks, you would be better off finding something else. The authors do not really cover these topics, favoring the easy path of wheeled robots. If your design requires wheels, buy it, if not, check it out at the library and save your money for the parts you need."
5,Everything you would need to know about motors,"I took on a freelance job and needed to get more detailed information/advice regarding motors and motor control. This book was all I needed. It's very informative and well written. It teaches you about the types of motors, how to select the right motor for your application, and finally how to control them using different kinds of circuits and integrated circuits. If you want to know the mathematical details of torque, how to measure your motor's torque, or how to decipher motor specs, it is all in this book.This book will be a great reference even for someone who already has some knowledge of motors."
1,Pieces Good (but book is weak for 2011t),"This book was a reasonable first review of robot drives. I particularly benefited from the review of PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control which oddly enough I see very little discussion on in some of the forums and books I have seen. It has some really basic review of certain concepts - which might be helpful to some. However, the chip sets proposed are older, the websites that no longer exist are numerous, leaving somewhere around 2/3 of the book really weak.Tongue in cheek writing style for most of book.I'm going to keep looking for more complete, up to date book. Just not worth the price, given its age. Should be under $10 to interest folks. (Actually, the more I think about it - suggest you spend your money on something more up to date.)"
5,integrates wisdom and knowledge,Thoroughly enjoyed this Sandplay text. The authors have accomplished the integration of wisdom and knowledge in their writing.
2,Too old to be good,"It's written in 1990s. Although Ms. Graham's works in the period have known to be wonderful, this book looks old fashioned to me and short of my expectation. I do not recommed this book to a new reader. However, if you are a fan of Ms. Graham and looking for a reminder of her works which contain a macho-style hero and a weeping heroine, it is not a bad choice."
3,"Love it, BUT......","i loved the hero and heroine adored their love story and the location,.....BUT, i want and need for a book (from the beginning) to have the main characters' thoughts as to the reason they behave a certain way. in this book we only get the heroine's point of view until almost the end of the book."
3,RealReader,"The Desert BrideThThe Desert BrideI did not think it was a five-star read. It may just be my personal dislike about the ""women having no role except owned by man"" subplot taking place in the story...a huge no, no in my opinion, but I didn't enjoy the book that much. I thought the hero overbearing but likeable and the heroine's role highly implausible. She's a doctor and yet we see no evidence of intelligence flowing from her--she has no emotional intelligence...which makes for a dumb book. It's not the worst book ever, but not that compelling either."
2,Who was the targeted audience for this music?,"Classical music lovers prefer the classical originals, Klaus Sculze's fans prefer his electronic compositions.Speaking for myself , both a classical music and a Klaus Schulze fan, I don't like it so much. It's not classical music and certainly it's not electronic music.One of the weakest Klaus Schulze albums."
5,Wrong selection,I ordered this model by mistake. It does not fit the Wrangler with three counters.I am sure the quality is there just the wrong one!
1,Fits nice but doesn't last long,"This cover fits the grill perfectly. However, it faded and ripped during the first year of use. Does anyone know of a good cover that will fit this particular grill?"
5,grill master,"This was a gift for my guy to go along with his new grill. Cover arrived quickly and without any defects. It is easy to use, fits the grill perfectly. Would purchase this item again."
2,Char-Griller 2323 Cover,"Unfortunately, I did not know the Model number of my Char-Griller and I ordered the incorrect correct cover. It has been returned. I needed a cover that would cover a 30 inch grill. Can you start putting the size of Char-Griller the cover fits on the web-site for those of us who have had a Char-Griller for a long time and can not remember the model number? I have had mine for over ten (10) years!!"
2,Exact Fit,An exact fit for two models of Char-Griller. I have the model without the extra smoker. For this one you can cut off the excess material on the other side of the Velcro. It fits so exactly it is a little difficult to put on. But it does look good in place!Added comments after one year of ownership--Just downgraded this item because of two problems--It turns from black to light grey in one season in the sun.It also becomes very weak and easy to rip at the corners after one season.
1,"No, no, no....","This cover deteriorated after only ONE season. It is falling apart now. The fit is not the problem, the material is. Do not waste your money. If you do, be prepared to replace it in a year."
2,I have to agree...,"This cover is a great fit, looks good at the beginning. But within a year it begins to deteriorate. I managed to make my cover last 2 years, but only because I didn't have the gumption to search for a replacement cover.It really is a shame, as I like the grill very much."
1,Falls Apart,"After about 6 months of use I was putting this cover back on my grill and a 2 foot seem ripped open right in the middle. I was being pretty careful when it happened too. It basically just fell apart. Unless you want to buy a new cover every 6 months, I'd steer clear of this brand."
3,No change,"Had one of these covers for a little over a year and it fell apart. Purchased this one hoping some improvements had been made. Not smart, it is the same cover. If this grill was not so durable and good cooking I would purchase a different setup. I really would like to find one that would hold up and fit this grill."
2,"Good info, but tedious","Christopher Schwartz is a very good author. I can read his stuff at length, but frankly, I find it mind numbing to listen to him do an instruction video. I also have ""Forgotten Hand Tools"" so this isn't a fluke. It took two to three viewings to get through it. Obviously just my opinion but he goes on incessently about every detail and then repeats again. When you add that to his monotone pitch, it gets tough for one sitting. I think I heard the definition of ""Course, Medium and Fine"" at least 15 times.On the upside - I don't question his expertise on the subject but just feel I would have been much better off to read it."
5,Colorful and beautifully illustrated variety of Kwanzaa gift,"This book was not only helpful, but it is so beautifully done. It is colorful and vibrant. i read it over and over. it as so many wonderful ideas for Kwanzaa while also providing a very meaningful understanding of the occasion. It is a very inspiring book. It makes me proud to be Affrican American and have at my disposal so many ways to demonstrate the principles of Kwanzaa to family and friends. The handmade gifts encourage the creativity in all of us. I enjoyed each section immensely. Thanks You"
5,Hilarious Romp,"I read Jerry Todd and the Buffalo Bill Bathtub in 1938, when I was 12 years old, and the details escape me now. But I read a lot at that age, and I do remember that this book delighted me more than anything else I'd read, kids books or adult books. Kids that like the outdoors, especially kids with active imaginations, might very well enjoy this middle reader."
4,An unpredictable story of suprising terror.,"I am atracted to scary stories,so I bought this book as soon as I saw it.At first I was thinking that this might not be as scary as it was said to be,but as I got further into it,I found that it was full of suprises.The main charecter Laura,is so well described that I feel as though I've known her my whole life.This is a fabulous book,and I recomend it to anyone who loves bone chilling tales."
5,Excellent midia,"DVD-RAM discs are the best dvd midia to work with, mainly with a DVD Camcorder. I have no problems with these Panasonic ones."
2,Mini DVD ram,"I don't like the DVD ram because you can't finalise it, therefore it won't play on DVD players. You have to tranfere the video and remake it to DVD in order to play on regular DVD players."
3,Confusing for a child,"I read this book when I was younger, and got really confused. I recommend this book for older persons than a child."
4,Another good book from the author of The Westing Game,"I had just read The Westing Game, and I needed more. I checked out Figgs and Phantoms because I thought I couldn't go wrong with the author. I read it in about two days, and when I was done I was very disappointed. I was expecting a wonderful mystery, but instead, I get an interesting fantasy. For about three days, I told people how dumb it was, but then I really thought about it. I realized that the focus was really on the main character, and not much on the plot, which then made me like it more. Then I realized it applied to me, making it much for enjoyable. I really liked the book."
2,TYA Who?,"Buy this album if you want to give a new young guitarist with some promise a break. Don't buy it if you want to hear Ten Years After because this ain't them. No Alvin Lee makes this a totally different band and one that can't possibly measure up. Talent here gets a B+, material a C+, creativity and originality draw an F."
3,Ten Beers After,I really do appreciate the fact that the talents of original band members are on display here sans Alvin Lee. I enjoy much of the music. Joe Gooch is a talent in his own right. To me Ten Years After is Alvin Lee. To call this band Ten Years After is simply a misnomer; The Joe Gooch Band would have been more appropriate. Buy this. It is fun to listen to but buy it on its own merits not because of Alvin Lee's prior association with Ten Years After.
2,Needs some soul,"I was visiting friends in Germany last year and went to see TYA, enjoyed them, and bought this album from their website. I don't know how much they sound like the original TYA and not having even been around for their heyday I don't really care.When I saw them I thought the band had a lot of spontaneity. On this CD what I hear is layer upon layer of production with such an emphasis on trying to be technically excellent that they've managed to avoid having any soul. The guitarist is terrific and has a lot of promise in a Satriani style but he sounds like he is trying too hard to be perfect. Instead of just giving in to the music he is trying to control it. The songs are all good if not outstanding but none really a standout. I'm disappointed because this band seemed to have the ability to be better than this. Blues rock is a dying genre and so I'd hoped this band would give us something to help revitalize it. Instead they have put out something just ordinary."
1,Just OK,"This is Ten Years After without Alvin Lee. It's hard to imagine a band that was centered around the guitar and vocals of Alvin Lee without Alvin Lee. It's alright, but too bad they were forced toname themselves after a famous 60's-70's band."
1,False Advertising.,"An album labeled ""Ten Years After"" that doesn't have Alvin Lee, the heart of TYA, is false advertising. Though it's a decent CD, after I bought the album and found out the truth, I felt cheated. I'm a big ""Alvin Lee"" fan. I ripped the two Alvin Lee classics they stuck at the end, and burned them onto the end of a ""REAL"" TYA CD, and then sold this CD to a used CD store. If you like TYA, or just Alvin Lee solo, buy any other TYA CD than this one. ""A Space in Time,"" was of course their best, and my most recommended. But ANYTHING with Alvin Lee is better."
5,WOW!,"WOW, I like it babe, I like it. That`s the real Kick Ass Rock!This guys are still the best. Leo Lyons is a 62 years old frantic bassman on stage, and nobody can beat him . And Joe Gooch is together with this old first class Woodstock veteransa day and night dream. Now is Wow!!! Hotest Live band I`ve ever seen!"
4,A TASTY ONE FROM GEORGE,"With this book, George Foreman demonstrated that his strong hands, which are famous for delivering painful punches, are capable of delivering delicious dishes. Cherie Calbom was his 'corner-man' in this fat-fight.This cookbook is very practical in outlook: employing a step-by-step method. It explained the fundamental routines of tabling low-fat grills (and barbecue). It has a well-balanced approach: providing good tuition on both recipes and their healthiest mode of preparation.The book will bring fun to your kitchen, and smile on your table. However, if you are interested in continuous experiments, its 176 pages may not be enough as to fulfill all your grilling desires. Support it with a more extensive cookbook for the best result."
2,George Foreman's Knock out the fat Barbece and grilling cookbook,It had alot of recipes that I would not use with indegrents that most people do not have on hand. If you are wanting a simple grilling cookbook to use this not the cookbook for you.
3,misleading title,"For a book called 'Knock Out the Fat', it is amazing how many recipes are included that have high amounts of fat and calories. Do not buy this book for low fat recipes. Buy it for recipes to use on indoor grill."
1,TKO for Foreman,"I am very disappointed with this book. I expected specific instructions on how to use his grilling machine. Instead the bulk of the book contains general rules about healthy eating: 1. Avoid fat 2. Avoid fast food restaurants 3. Use of low fat substitutes 4. Substitute veggies for meat 5. etc. All of which most of us already know and have many books on these subjects.Here and there in his book, he refers to using a grilling machine. (the reason I bought the book). However you have to hunt for this information. I was looking for specific ways to use his machine. Instead I got generalities.I would suggest to anyone who has not bought his grilling machine, DON'T DO IT, unless you want to experiment on your own to find ways to use it. So far, I have used it to cook a hamburger which I overcooked because I didn't know how long to cook it. As long as I have the machine I will experiment with it. Maybe I will learn how to use it. His book certainly hasn't helped very much."
4,The Grill is great- The book is great too,"I love George Foreman's grill too, however I think that most people assumed that the book went with his popular grill. I think you will find that the book is awesome if you don't place any ""grill expectations"" on it. He is fun, and don't let anyone tell you this is not a good book."
2,His other book is better for the Foreman Grill,"If you are looking for recipes to use on your Foreman grill pass by this book and get ""George Foreman's Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machine Cookbook"" ISBN# 1929862032 by George Foreman & Connie Merydith; Paperback - June 2000, Pascoe Publishing. Its written specifically for the Foreman grill and will get you the confidence to experiment on your own."
5,surprizingly excellent!,"I bought this after I bought the grill. Having tried the recipes that came with the george foreman grill and finding them excellent, I decided to invest in a whole george forman cookbook.The marinades are excellent! Many have few ingredients and maximum taste. While they are helpful if you have the grill they are excellent even if you don't. Marinades are a wonderful way to grill, in general. Some of them lend themselves even to panfrying, depending on the cut of meat or poulty. While you cant use bone-in meats in the GF grill, you can use these recipes with bone-in cuts and use an alternate cooking method (grilling, broiling or baking for chicken).This was a big surprize! At first I thought it was going to gimick-y and just a cookbook capitalizing on the GF name. But it is a *study* cookbook in its own right. excellent."
3,Seems to have lost its accuracy,"I use this thermometer daily. At first I loved it, it was so fast and seemed accurate. Then one day it was sitting on my sons changing table near a sunny window. When I took my sons temp it said he had a raging fever. I had another digital thermometer that I took his temp with and he was fine. Since that day the readings have been all over the board. I know this thing was not exposed to raging heat as this was April in Colorado.I definetly need a thermometer I can trust and one that is not so easily effected by the outside elements!"
5,so easy,I can't believe this got bad reviews! It works extremely fast and I love that you don't have to guess how far to insert it. I would definitely recommend it.
4,Great Beginning Reader...,"My children (4 and 6) loved this book, and all the other books in the series. Simple words, short sentences, short books, and familiar concepts made these books a winner with my family. These are great books for those who still can't read all the way through the Dr. Seuss books yet."
5,sam's bath,Great little story! My kids followed Sam's Cookie and Sam's Ball and they were thrilled with Sam's Bath.Product in good condition and arrived very fast.
5,Dr. Krackers great taste,"As part of a nutritional program, I use Dr. Krackers (6-8) in stead of bread. I love them with a salad. They have a great taste -- crunchy with a taste of sunflower seeds. Unlike many crackers, they DON'T taste like cardboard; I really look forward to having them with lunch."
4,"Not a Great Work of Literature, But...","I enjoyed this book. It wasn't a great ground breaking work of art, BUT, it was an entertaining afternoon summer read."
5,Wonderful,"Rarely a piece of music is heard that is beautiful and at the same time transformative. If it is possible for a CD to inspire pray and devotion, this is it. Listen to it and be prepared to enter another realm. I loved it."
5,"Wonderful, atonished. I recommend this book","He lei'do esta novela, fue' la primera de Figueroa que llego' a mis manos, y desde alli' le he seguido el paso. No en vano casi todos sus libros se han convertido en peli'culas. Aqui', la historia es ficticia, y Albert Vazquez muestra bastante dominio del campo de los seres dusplicados. Fascinante historia que me cuativo' desde el principio y la recomiendo a los que aman las aventuras y el supenso."
2,COSMIC DANCE,"i love the writings of Joyce Rupp.This title was intriguuing,But sorry to say I couldn't get into it,i will donate it to the library ,"
4,"The Cosmic Dance, an in vitation...",Another great resource. Rupp never fails to present new ideas and open us to new understandings.Thanks again.
3,FASCINATING AT FIRST; THEN BECOMES TEDIOUS,"The Hurt Locker is an almost docudrama about a bomb squad in Iraq; but specifically one soldier named SFC William James (Jeremy Renner), and his delusional take on life and his job. Slanted, anti-war and almost anti-military, I felt this film by director Kathryn Bigelow was almost an insult to our men and women in uniform. It is fascinating for the first hour as you watch these men do their very dangerous work in a very hostile environment; but then it becomes tedious and almost boring as they get drunk and beat the hell out of each other on their time off. Rated R for violence and language.Waitsel Smith"
4,"Not the Great Iraq War Movie, but tense and gripping","Jeremy Renner is a fine actor who deserves more exposure (his ABC cop show was canceled way too quickly!) and he eats up the scenery as the bomb disposal tech with nerves of steel. But his character is a bit too cool, almost inhuman in his calm approach to terrifying danger, and this portrayal constitutes the main flaw that makes this merely a good movie instead of a great one. Nevertheless the film does an excellent job of capturing the ambiance of a nervous occupation army surrounded by a sea of uniformly hostile Iraqis, commendably reinforcing the magnitude of America's colossal strategic error. The plot has few surprises but then so does life, most of the time."
4,Adrenaline Junky,"Jeremy Renner stars as a bomb tech who risks his life defusing IEDs, car bombs, and human body stuffed bombs. He loves the danger of it all which to me is the really interesting thing to watch and think about. It has to be really hard for soldiers to adjust to the real world after ""living in the now"" in places like Iraq. Speaking of Iraq, this movie was shot-in Jordan and looked exactly like what Iraq probably looks like (I've never been). I would like to meet a bomb tech one day and shake his hand. I bet he is one crazy S.O.B because you have to be to do that job."
5,AWESOME,I was even more impressed how fast I received DVD. Great quality and great price and most of all Great movie. I would recommend amazon to anyone. Look forward to many future purchases.
3,"Alright, but where's the story???","My wife and I were expecting a lot more out of this movie, but were quite disappointed. The scenes were intense and even if they aren't true depictions, gives the viewer a taste of the constant tension one would face. The problem is, this is a movie, and normally a movie has a story to go along with all the scenes. The Hurt Locker is missing this vital element. There are also some glaring screen writing no no's, that can only be broken with great skill, skill in which the writer apparently lacks. One major one being that our hero doesn't change. Decent movie, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it."
2,Couldn't get into it,"I couldn't get into the characters. It seemed like I should have been identifying with the characters and how they handled their situation, but I found myself bored more than anything. I felt no connection with the characters. I now understand why so many reviews just picked on the realism and what kind of uniform they were wearing. There wasn't much else to pick on."
3,It's ok 6.5/10,I know people are going to leave immature comments of like how dare you (insert here) boo hoo boo hoo boo hoo boo hoo wan wan. But I felt it was overrated & when I say overrated it doesn't mean it was bad. It had good characters it wasn't to cliche it had really strong scenes the movie does make you use your head I felt the adrenaline pump during the bomb defuseal scenes I really was like oh these guys are f****d during 1 of the shoot out scenes. There aren't a lot of female directors out there but it's nice to see a female director get her props I was entertained sure I was I just felt it was overrated to the max & it wasn't God awful like Halloween 2 I just saw it's just ok. IMO it's worth a rental nothing I'll go & buy right now maybe $5 in a bargain bin. If you just thought it was just the greatest movie ever it's fine I got some enjoyment out of it but it was over hyped it's my opinion. So to each there own.
1,"Boring, by-the-numbers war movie","This is another proof (if one was still needed) tha Oscar is like politcs, but worse. This insane amount of awards for such a pedestrian war movie? Heck, ""PLATOON"" blows this out of the water anytime, even watching it today. Saving Private Ryan, same thing. I could mention a lot of others (Black Hawk Down; Cross of Iron).Direction is sloppy; acting is average. Photography is so-and-so. A lot of war movies managed to show the conflict, tensions, pscilogical doubts AND the action much better.Maybe they simply did not want AVATAR to gather all the awards (I'm not saying it did deserve it or not; I'm just guessing); maybe they wanted a female director to get it (no prejudice here-just analysing the statistics).Highly disappointing."
2,Really People?,"I cannot believe this movie is nominated for awards... really? It was terrible! My husband and I watched it until the end continually hoping something endearing would change our minds. Uh, nope. I didn't give a crap about any of the characters since their personal development as well as the development of their relationships was so scant. So much of the movie was unrealistic I don't know where to begin. Anyway, I love reading reviews- so it's only fair that I give mine, too. Sorry guys, but I wish I would have passed on this."
1,A Motion Sickness Film,With this horrible trend film-makers moving around with cameras that makes me vomit! I am Deaf and I do watch the screen without sounds and I see this one of few tragic loss of sense of this film. I hope the new trend films would use the rolling-railings and keep on tripod on. This plot is great but watching the screen isn't.
4,Great Middle East War Film,"When it comes to war movies, alot of the good ones are about WWII and Vietnam. ""The Hurt Locker"" is the first good war movie that is about ""The War on Terror"".""The Hurt Locker"" is about bomb squad unit that deals with roadside bombs, car bombs, ect. This is a very realistic, because as we all know, the suicided bombings are a big issue for the war.""The Hurt Locker"" is a very realistic and entertaining film. Also, you don't have to be a huge war movie fan to enjoy this film."
2,And,"This movie won the oscar? Just goes to show you it's not ""what you know"", but ""who you know"". Hell, Pandorum (a sci-fi film) was 200 times better than this ""waste of 2 hours of my life"" movie. I wish I had my money & time back for this joke."
3,Have a blast!,"THE HURT LOCKER won best picture for 2009, after my six art house friends and I saw it. There is nothing extraordinary about THE HURT LOCKER, which is the least-viewed ""Best Picture"" in history, a kind of reminder that ""Best Pictures"" don't equate to ""Most Popular Pictures.""It's the story of a US Army bomb-defusing specialist in Iraq, and the various horrors he faces unflinchingly throughout the day. As such, its a grand endorsement of our troops and a grand indictment of our war.Still, I have no idea why THE HURT LOCKER won, other than it wasn't the bloated AVATAR. From what I've read it isn't particularly accurate, and it has a pace slower than that of its hero in his blast suit. It's worth seeing (once), but its not at all memorable. If it hadn't been the dark horse Oscar winner, I doubt I'd even remember it."
3,Fair,"Criticism around the facts of the story behind this film I can't speak to. That aside, the film sold itself on stress, which I'm sure I can't imagine what wartime is really like, but I do know it takes more than stress to convey a compelling story. While the technical aspects and direction of the film were impressive, the acting wasn't anything to write home about. It's clear that this film got a lot of attention due to its timeliness and controversy. It's not because it was that great."
1,This movie was probably written in a day,Wow... the writing and directing of this movie were way below par. The scene where they are pinned down by the sniper is just ridiculous. I don't think the insurgent snipers would hang around inside the same 10x10 brick building (isolated in the middle of the desert) wile taking fire from a 50-cal. Complete waste of time and money.
1,waste of time,"Could have been a 3rd grade cable network show. The movie brought no value to me. I was not taken anywhere and I did not feel anything. Some suspense, modern war movie cliches (e.g. the bumbling hick) and the awesome insight that war is gruesome and terrifying. There are so many other engrossing war movies which renders this one a joke."
1,Biggest disappoinment in film in a decade...,"I never thought a film about bomb disposal could be as stunningly slow, uninteresting and uninformative as this piece of garbage. it also manages to kill the two best actors it has within minutes of them appearing. Jeremy Renner is a hack who should never have been nominated in the 1st place. this film is a joke on America by a woman who up until recently has made some really good (BLUE STEEL, NEAR DARK) to excellent (STRANGE DAYS) films. she shouldn't have listened to her ex James Cameron on this one."
1,Pathetic,"I love war movies. I hated this one. Yes, characters can grow to love war, but no one who pulls the wires on bombs lives long enough to have defused the number of bombs he claims to have defused. He would not have been doing that. Why is it in the movie? It is in the script, so it is a lousy script.A little realism in handling of bombs would have improved the movie 100%. The way it is written, he is the kind of guy who is going to have an ""accident"" after he endangers his unit one time too many.I thought it was a typical inept effort by someone who has never really been to war. I know he was over there, the script guy, but he obviously wasn't disarming bombs.I liked the depiction of Iraq, the dangers, etc, but the ""hero"" is an inept idiot, and the script that has him pulling bombs out of the sand, or the car, by the wires is just bad writing.I can't believe it is getting nominated for Oscars, etc. There's a phrase from Vietnam: REMF. This is a REMF movie."
1,review,"I just had to give this movie 1 star. It's just amazing how masmedia can manipilate a crowd. Those people can feed any bs they want like toyota unsafe (like those people care about your safety), go see twilight new moon wonderful movie ( why not to give this family flick oscar too? ). I agree with octoworm's kid's review. It's pathetic, unrealistic, pretentious, masterpiece wanna be pog.It's just shows to world again what all this oscar ""awarding"" dirty business is. Mel Gibson was right."
1,what a completely FORGETTABLE war film!!!!,To the point: As i was watching this film...i was forgetting it. I have seen much better war films and this one doesn't even come CLOSE to even being on the radar. Shame on the Oscars for letting this film even be nominated for best picture. What a waste of time.
1,Great Disappointment,"I knew in advance that there would be serious technical flaws in this movie, but I did expect a great movie given the hype and the statue. I just saw nothing particularly redeeming other than the quality of the filming, set dressing, and effects.Where to start? The lead character is both unlikeable and unsympathetic. Those characteristics by themselves would not be such a problem if he wasn't also so unrealistic. Tom Cruise as Maverick in Top Gun was more believable as a Naval Aviator - and that is saying something.The story is just not that interesting. Action substitutes for plot.Finally the technical aspects stink. The closest thing to realistic EOD was the opening sequence. Real EOD techs are cautious by nature, they have to be. They rarely ""cut the red wire"", preferring to BIP (Blow in Place) an explosive especially an IED. Some dramatic license is expected in a Hollywood effort, but at least a nod to reality is expected."
1,If you're current or ex military skip this,For those of us who have ever served in the military this movie was horrible. It is 100% unrealistic and plays on the public's ignorance to create tension and drama. Oh you're EOD and all of a sudden you're better snipers than the SPECIAL FORCES right next to you? Skip this movie if you care whatsoever about realism and go watch something else worth your time.
5,fantastic,i read a book similar to this a couple years before this movie came out. different people different war but same story. addicted to war like a drug. its a great story both the movie and the book (my war gone by i miss it so) its great.
3,Has its moments even if it's distinctly overrated,"The Bottom Line:The Hurt Locker is a decent film with a persuasive performance by Jeremy Renner in the lead, but long after it has convinced us of its central premise (""war is a drug"") it keeps pounding the point home, leading to a running length that feels padded and several moments in which the pace slows to a crawl; I *wanted* to like this movie as much as everyone else but aside from the opening and closing action sequences it lacks tension and is certainly not the best film of 2009.3/4"
3,Need an iron stomach,"The movie itself was entertaining, and I'd say overall it was a good movie; however, why did they have to jiggle the camera around so much -- and zoom in and out? I get what they're trying to do: give it that gritty type of feel. But sometimes the camera just zooms in on a shot, and then zooms back out -- maybe even back in. And then half the time, the camera is jiggling around on the shots. For me, I have to look away sometimes just so my stomach calms down."
4,WONDERUL,"GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT IS DOES NOT GEORGE CLOONEY AND BRAD PITT TO MAKE A MOVIE, JUST VERY GOOD. OVER HYPED ACTORS FEEDING THEIR EGOS NOT IN THIS MOVIE, SOLID, SOLID MOVIE.....AND NO HOLLYWOD HYPE...SWEETER. ALL DUE REPECT TO MOVIES REVIWERS WHO ARE VETS AND DID NOT LIKE THIS....WE ALL FEEL YOUR PAIN AND FEEL YOUR ANGER......YOU WILL BE OK....REMEMBER VIETNAM VETS WERE SPIT ON FOR THAT VERY POLITICAL WAR....AND NOT HERO WORSHIPPED AS THEY SHOULD OFF...ANOTHER BLACK EYE TO AMERICA....ANYWAY GET THE MOVIE....AND ENJOY..IT ROCKS !!!"
5,an eloquent poetic ballet,"wow.just finished watching this film about an hour ago,and i'm still trying to put it into words.it's basically about an elite military bomb squad unit in Iraq,whose job is made tougher because they are still very much in a combat situation.this a very powerful moving experience.riveting right to the last frame.nail biting suspense.great acting.sometimes the quite moments speak louder and more clearly than any words can.the movie is very well constructed.its all so eloquent,like a poem,a ballet.the running time may just be shy of one hundred and thirty minutes,but it sure doesn't feel that long.i could watch this film again without hesitation.war themed movies are not everyone's cup of tea obviously,but if you are a fan of the genre,you owe it to yourself to check this film out.i haven't seen a film this good in a long time.for me,The Hurt Locker is a 5/5"
2,Didn't like it at all!,"I agree with a lot of the reviews on this movie. I'm a war movie buff and it's not all about the shoot em up...bang-bang...bombs all of the time but at least it could've had a good plot and story line. This movie lacked in all areas and I actually feel asleep after watching it for about an hour, which I hardly ever fall asleep when I'm really in to a movie.This movie just didn't cut it for me and I wish that I wouldn't have spent my money on this and spent it on another movie that I put back to get this one. Maybe I'll try to watch it again to see if there was something that I missed but if it was good I would have caught it when I first watched it.There are also a lot of good reviews from people who liked the movie. Personally I would not reccommend this movie to anyone."
3,overrated,"The movie was completely overrated. It was ok, a little bit cheesy when they hit the soliloquies. I don't get the whole Oscar thing. It just wasn't that good. It's a Sunday rental not a keeper."
4,Why didn't I watch this when it was picked as best picture in 09?,"This movie was great and hard to find for a streaming rental anywhere else. I used my computer to add it to my watchlist and then tuned in to watch the movie with my Xbox360! Also kind of happy I have my prime account ;)Good film, Enjoyed it thoroughly."
4,Different take on the work our young men do for us!,"With the changes in warfare, this is one look at real stress is. I didn't like the ending, to short!"
5,katherine Bigelow impressed me tremendously,"Im not familiar with too many women directors. But I was shocked to find out that one had made one of the best war films to come a long in a long time. Funny, Terrifying, suspenseful, heart wrenching and real, this film delivered on every level. And the end, though simple, really paints a portrait of the reality a lot of our service men and women go through. This is a must see for any and everyone."
1,War Porn,"I served two tours in Iraq. This is an insult to veterans from any war. It's an insult to the Iraqi people. It's an insult to the moviegoer. It's an insult to cinema. In short, I guess you could say, I didn't like it."
2,Just Didn't Grab Me...,"I can't really point to any glaring flaws in the movie. It just didn't grab me. They're a bomb disposal squad and throughout the movie they dispose of bombs. Sometimes people die. And they go on disposing bombs. etc. It did seem gritty and realistic, but also repetitive and mundane. Just didn't seem like best picture material to me."
2,Not very impressive,The movie as a whole is not very impressive.I found this movie quite boring. The story was simple. The major actors did not attract the attention of the audience.The extraction of a bomb from inside the body of a kid was disturbing but the set up of the scene does not look like real.
4,The Hurt Locker,This movie made me feel sad to see what our troops are going thru to protect our freedoms in a land where they don't know who their friend is or who the enemy may be. A very moving movie. Makes you think how lucky we are to have brave men and women fighting for us in a far away land. A good movie.
1,Won the oscar? How?,"This movie won Oscar awards? This has to be one of the worse movies I have ever watched. I wouldn't keep this movie if It was given to me. I watched it, and kept wondering when it was going to get good, after all it won oscars... it has to get good sometime right? Boy was I wrong, me and my family could not believe it when it was over.. what a waste of time.After viewing this you have to laugh at Oscar awards now.. what a joke. Worthless award if movies like this win. Wasn't the director banned from the awards for violating their policy too? But yet the movie still won?"
3,Not Worth The Hype,That this movie won the best picture Oscar tells me that the movies are getting worse every year. I would rather watch about 20 different war movies before I ever watched this one again. Just rent it!
2,Disappointing,"Some interesting cinematography and occasional artful suspense, but the plot was contrived and mundane in the extreme, and where it was just free-floating (almost improvised and documentary like), it was boring. There simply was much too much dead space.With the format chosen (which granted was daring), the film could ill-afford to just take the low road and become another ""Bad Boy"" military hero story. It needed to jump into another orbit of creativity, and here it did not. Instead, it hewed much too closely to the old tried and true hero's script.Since there was so much talk about Bigelow possibly winning an award for best director, I was hoping to join the bandwagon, but I expected a lot more and frankly was very disappointed. Two stars"
2,"OK movie, but not very realistic or exciting","I don't want to say it's unwatchable, so it got two stars instead of one. What I don't understand is how it won awards. It was fairly slow paced, not a single compelling character, and almost zero excitement. If it's neither ""artsy"" or exciting, what is it?Bad. That's what it is. Boring and bad. I wish I didn't waste the time, because that's a couple of hours I wish I had back. :("
1,Terrible Movie,I thought this movie was terrible. It was the most overrated movie I have seen in a long time. Don't waste your time watching it.
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"Seriously, I regret ever watching this pile of steaming trash. The production values were horrible, the plot was thin and none of the characters were believable. Please don't waste your time or money making the same mistake I did!"
4,Hurt Locker mood just as important as story...,"I am also a veteran but with no first hand combat experience, I worked on F-14's, but don't see me getting my panties in a bunch over Top GunTop Gun(ok not the same type of movie) but as others have pointed out, that it is meant to entertain, I have spoken to other veterans that say while there are a lot of liberties are taken, many feel the overall tension/mood of the film does offer something that many other war movies have not been able to portray, and I think they manage to not make it political and move it to a personal level. The acting is outstanding and the setting in Jordan only miles from the Iraq border adds to the gritty feel. Something the filmmakers did (spoiler alert) is to kill off the faces you recognize and let then little known actors take the lead that added to the tension that at any moment any character could die."
3,Just another action movie,"My problem with the Hurt Locker is that it is marketed and hyped as being unique and accurate while in reality it is not unique and not accurate. The Hurt Locker is full of the same military cliches that every action movie has: the main characters answer to no one, they do what they want when they want, and break off into random one-man-army moments like clearing buildings or taking to the streets at night to hunt down bombers. This is the kind of thing that makes a movie interesting, sure, but it is not accurate. The inaccuracies mount when you compare how the procedures and tactics of this unit are not consistent with our Army EOD teams. In the end the movie felt disjointed and I came away from it entertained but confused about what I was supposed to feel about it."
2,It was mediocre,"This was an average rental. The critics got ecstasy over it but I honestly didn't feel it. Saving Private Ryan [Blu-ray] was a much better film than this in terms of a gripping war-movie, plot, and cinematography. The entire plot for this film pretty much focuses on the main character deciding whether to cut the blue wire or the red wire. That is the movie in a nutshell if you like that type of entertainment."
3,Mid-Range Film,"Contains many scenes filmed with a jumpy hand held camera, which generates much vertigo, and there are intermittent periods of inaction which necessitate the use of one's fast forward button. Again, there are multiple night-time and dimly lit scenes which are extremely difficult to decipher on a 27"" TV screen. Yes, there is one interesting battle scene, and many instances of suspense centering around, ""Will the guy get blown up or not?"" Other than that, I honestly don't see much here to recommend."
3,It shouldn't have won the best movie Academy Award,"It's incredible that this movie won the best picture Academy Award, who should have gone to ""UP IN THE AIR"" or ""PRECIOUS"" instead.Even ""DISTRICT 9"" or ""UP"" are better than the good but unnecessarily too long ""THE HURT LOCKER""."
3,the hurt locker,"I was disappointed. I was expecting more genuine combat scenes, I thought it was over dramatic. The military I was in for 42-years, beginning with WWII, my comrades did not talk or act like these soldiers did. Of course I was in the U.S. Marine Corps. I was disappointed in the dialog between the soldiers."
3,This film did not deserve an OSCAR! PERIOD!!!!!,"After watching the Hurt Locker, I think the entire Academy Awards should be laid off. This movie deserves neither Best Picture nor Best Director. Americans don't need these prejudice, preconceived old farts to be their judges."
5,Edge of your seat,"Jeremy Renner gave a wonderful performance. His qualities remind me of Steve McQueen. I was sitting on the edge of my seat as I watched this picture. It was terrifying, intense and moving. I would like to see more films like this one. If you want to see drama this would be a good one to pick."
3,Shows insight into the mind of those who go to war ... with a number of problems on the surface.,"The Hurt Locker may provide insight into the minds of our soldiers, sailors and airmen who've gone to war, but there are a number of issues (as others have stated) with the plot and continuity of the film."
4,OK,I expected it to be better. With all the hype I thought it should be better than it was.That's all.
2,"Okay, but not THAT good!","Having never heard of this movie until shortly before the Oscars, I was eager to take a peek. Big disappointment! It is an okay movie, but for the life of me I cannot figure out how this one made it past the first level of scrutiny wrt even a nomination. I did not serve in Iraq, but did in Vietnam, and maybe things have changed ... a lot! But I doubt it. I thought it was a mediocre portrayal of war in general, their mission in particular, with an unlikely plot and barely believable props (Hueys?) and scene detail.It is worth listing on your Netflix list, but be prepared for disappointment if you are looking for the year's best!"
3,"Some good, some awful","I watched this with my husband who has been to Iraq three times now. So much of this movie was really unrealistic and basically crap. I like the basic premise of it, it's shot well (some of the street scenes were apparently very well done), and there's no politics involved. But these guys wouldn't have been out clearing alone all the time, or getting off the FOB alone, or doing most of the stuff they do. It's just annoying to me that people who have no idea what the military is really like will think that this cowboy stuff happens without consequence."
2,BORING!,"Not worth all of the Oscar hype AT ALL. I mean, it was an interesting movie, but it was not as fast-paced as I had hoped...in fact, it was even a little boring in parts. The hype for the lead actor, Jeremy Renner, was not really well-deserved either. I have seen him do a much better job in some other films. Oh well."
2,The two best actors in the movie died after 2 minutes of screen time.,"Unrealistic,Problem 1,Guy Pearce,(The only reason I saw this movie), dies two minutes after the movie started.Problem 2, The completely stupid ""Ambush"" scene in the desert. or Hey we're under fire, let's all stand up and fire our rifles from the hip, Just like John Wayne. I was in the Infantry, when you come under fire, you don't stand up, you do the opposite. What the heck were EOD guys doing out there in the first place? Did they go to sniper school as well?Problem 3, There is this thing called a chain of command. Rogue types, don't last long, in the real chain of command.There are many other other problems with this ""realistic movie"", but it is not worth discussing any further.Conclusion.Stupid hollywood attempt at war drama. Might help to get a technical advisor next time.Watch ""Black Hawk Down"" instead."
4,Was OK.,"Honestly, I don't understand this movie's rave reviews and awards. Was a good movie, but didn't think it was that great."
2,Not sure of the point,"This is a genre film: war is hell. They made these by the dozens in WW2. Here, we go to Iraq for a few days in the lives of some bomb defusers. This is not a subtle movie. You will wonder why the US ever bothered to send people to such an absurd place. Tension builds throughout as we expect most of the soldiers to die grisly deaths. Some do. Some don't. In the end, we are told, some prefer this way of life over civilian life. HHmmmm....where have we seen that theme before in a story about battle-scarred soldiers? You won't learn anything watching this. I can't quite pronounce it entertainment, either."
2,Love among bomb techs (EOD),"This movie is repetitive and boring. The same cowboy (Jeremy Renner) rushes in where wise men never tread to dismantle bombs, dismantle people, and dismantle our time. All the characters are one-dimensional. The story does not have any redeeming social value. There is no rhyme or reason; there is just a bunch of explosions and more explosions and more explosions.They did borrow a tad from ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" by sending the dissenbomer home to an environment that did not understand him.I would give you more details about the film but that is all there is. Okay takes place in Iraq 2004.Actual filming Locations are ""Amman, Jordan"", ""Kuwait"", and ""Langley, British Columbia, Canada.""The Blu-ray has a voice over commentary. This explains why this looks like one long commercial for a film by people that were just reporters."
1,Just a bad movie,"If you looking for an accurate depiction of how the fine men and women of the US Army dismantle IEDs, don't count on this movie to provide it for you. If you really want to learn about the risks involved with this profession, watch the 60 Minutes piece on it that really describes how life is for soldiers in this profession. The fact that this movie won an Academy Award only goes to show that awards in Tinseltown are handed out based on political affiliations, not on merit."
5,Thrill,"I really enjoyed the movie. It's got its own kind own slow suspense that never stops, and I was hooked from the start. I don't see this as an anti or pro-war film, simply a story about how it could have been to go to Iraq, and why some do it."
2,Would have been better if a real documentary,"I think HURT LOCKER would have been very good if it had been filmed authentically as a genuine documentary with a crew following around actual military personnel.As it is, it has a very synthetic and unrealistic ""movie"" feel to it.I am sure other ex- military people will agree."
3,Just ok.,"From an average housewife's point of view, the movie was just ok for me. I appreciate the fact that it wasn't as gory as Full Metal Jacket or Black Hawk Down and it had some tender moments and a decent storyline. I can't even think of anything special to write about it. I certainly don't think it deserved picture of the year..."
3,"An OK movie, should never have gotten Best Picture.","I bought the Blu Ray from Amazon figuring it would be an outstanding picture having just won best picture. I enjoyed the movie but consider it an average movie, nothing special. It is not a movie that I would watch a second time. In contrast Avatar I saw it in the theater in 3D and have since watched it twice on Blu Ray. It is a movie I will watch many more times. Hurt locker was a disappointment. My advise........Rent it don't buy it."
3,Boring,How can this movie win so much Oscar? It is slow and boring as a movie. There is one tense and one funny moment. That is it. The message is simple. American is just as fearsome as the bomb itself in middle east. I likeBlack Hawk DownandThe Kingdom (Widescreen Edition)much better.
3,Overrated,"Directing is up to the Oscar, but a movie without a story and very weak characters does not deserve the rest of them, especially not a best picture oscar. How many bomb defusings in a row can one take per hour ? Watch it to find your own threshold."
3,"Enjoyable, but doen't live up to the hype","Entertaining and has some good scenes but falls short of the hype around the movie. All war movies have unrealistic parts, but this one has more than its fair share."
5,MIND BLOWING MOVIE- WORTH THE BEST PICTURE,I WAS NOT SURE WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN I RENTED IT. I LIKED IT SO MUCH THAT I HAD TO PURCHASE IT FOR MY COLLECTION. THE MOVIE WAS WELL MADE AND VERY REALISTIC. FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A LOVED ONE IN THE SAND BOX IT'S A MUST SEE.
2,Alice in Wonderland,"I hadn't planned on watching this as I am a pacifist but a neighbor wanted to see it so rented it for me too. I returned it to Block Buster and was told that a woman directed it and was the first woman director to get best director. It struck me odd that a movie would win best director just because the director was a woman and not because of the movie's merits. I watched it and tried to understand it but got lost as to the plot and I didn't understand why the title ""The Hurt Locker"". The Hurt Locker sounds like a woman's fantasy. I think the director's imagination got the best of her and hopefully her next film will be less opinion and a little more factual. BTW I was 4 years in the Marines and not once did we act the way portrayed in the movie. There were other discrepancies like where did all that equipment appear from and the accuracy of the sniping was unbelievable. Off a mile on first shot and a kill on the second shot?"
2,The Hurt Locker,What a waste of time. I was so disappointed in this film. It never got kick started in my opinion. So much for critics choice.
3,Everyone loves blow-up movies!,"To many clichés (felt like I was watching Lethal Weapon 1&2 redone!), a main character that was too difficult to understand and very unrealistic, NO ONE that I ever served with would have served with him! The producers should have made up for the poor character arc and weak story with some tradecraft (think technical additions found in ""Blown Away""). It did get a star purely for the good looking end result of the movie (but that is easy for Hollywood these days). Overall, at 2 hours run time this was just barely entertaining and will not be watched again. But I only recommend it because everyone loves movies where things blow-up! Also, because of gore and language I would say it is not for the kiddies, unless you're a very liberal thinking parent (I am but ""body bomb"" scene got censored at my house)."
1,.....,apparently EOD units are similar to SF.. HAHAHA.. no seriously. the movie isn't realistic. popcorn movie yay!!
2,unconvincing,"seen many war movies and this is not one of the better ones. it is still watchable with a fairly original theme about bomb squads. the movie is slow at times and what kept my attention are the various bomb situations. character development was ok but i don't really feel like rooting for any of the main characters. the most convincing scene is the first few minutes with guy pearce.for me, this won't hold up to classics like 'das boot', 'braveheart', 'thin red line', 'platoon', 'last samurai', 'flags of our fathers', 'we were soldiers' etc"
3,Mediocre Movie,"The Hurt Locker was worth a watch, was moderately entertaining, and is not really worth watching a second time."
4,Hurt Locker,"I loved it so much that I loaned it to my Dad, a vet.The man didn't just become good at his job; he was his job. There are people who just live their occupation. This man devoted everything to what he did. He dedicated his very big heart to saving lives by killing bombs.Kudos!"
1,"Movie, or video game?","Was there a script, written by an author for this thing? Or did the actors just show up on location with some cameras to play with? Looks like they shot the the whole film in half a dozen set ups. Where is the story? Where is the character development? Why should we give a flip about what happens to any of these people?The only hurt here would be having to sit through a whole showing."
1,Boring ... very boring,very boring simple minded movie....unbelievable that it won the academy awards against Avatarhow in the world can they even compare Directing of this to theincredible job Cameron did (through all these years) on AvatarMovie history was made but they call this the best movie and directing of the year...what a joke...kathryn bigelow was great with Point Break but this is very boring....
3,Meh.,I think the Academy should take a more powerful antidepressant. More movies with more substance were more deserving candidates.
2,What a Lovely War,This is what Hollyweird thinks of as authentic. It makes them get goose bumps and shed tears. They give it every Award they can but in the end you are stuck with a box office failure that made less than $15 million in North America. By winning the Oscar it beat out CRASH as the least commercial film to win best picture. But that is the modern nature of the Oscars -- to celebrate movies that no one wanted to see and didn't. The errors in this movie have already been documented. To honest Kathryn Bigelow did her best film over 20 years ago with NEAR DARK.
3,Unrealistic military action scenes,"In reality this would happen:- the bomb squad would be protected by other military squads while disarming the bomb- bombs are almost always being blown up or disarmed/destroyed by a robot, not by the bombsuit guy unnecessary risking his life- the carbomb should have been blown up instead of being disarmed (and risking your life)- chasing bad guys at night, in unknown territory, in small alleys and by yourself is suicide- bombsquad guys getting in a sniper battle and winning? Not likely, they should have called in an airstrike or artillery- the crazy taxidriver would have been blown away long before he came close- walking alone at night in Iraq is a sure way to find yourself in a homevideo getting decapitatedGood story, good acting but I cringed at the action scenes"
1,Utterly Unrealistic,"Well, I spent 32 years on Army Active Duty and was a Lt Weapons Infantryman, among other specialties. I also completed the Army Mines, Demo and Boobytraps school. I found the DVD to be incredibly unrealistic in virtually every respect and apparently written and directed by people totally unfamiliar with the actual Army.There are so many discrepancies I could include, but just read the reviews by ""A Kid's Review,"" and ""Maskirovka."" they pretty much say it all. I cannot understand how this movie was given 6 academy awards and rated highly by critics. Must be politics and PC involved. I hate these kinds of movies."
3,The Hurt Locker,"The film didn't deserve to win Best Picture for 2009. It was entertaining and I understand what the director was trying to accomplish. The movie flows well and I do recommend seeing it. I would wait for the price to drop if you're purchasing the Blu-Ray version. War is a horrible thing but for some reason we are all drawn toward stories about war. It takes you on the trip reminding you how horrible things are for our men and women that serve our country over seas in war zones in these unstable countries. The perspective of the bomb disposal unit reminds us of a dangerous job not often portrayed as the main theme in films but as a sideline. I give credit to the writer for creating this story and being able to hold interest throughout the film. Though this movie is fiction, the region where this film takes place brings a realistic view of the dangers still being faced there by our armed forces at this time."
3,Why the big fuss?,"Look, this is a decent, well directed movie about soldiers disarming bombs. But that's it, quite frankly. I don't understand how this film won the Oscar for Best Picture, it's NOT that great.There's little to no story here. To me, a good film has to have a great story. It's a GOOD film, worth a look most certainly. But Oscar winner? Come on."
3,Major Mediocrity,"As an avid fan of war movies, I found The Hurt Locker a big disappointment. The action was too slow and the entire movie was focused on only one thing -- the disarming or detonation of IUDs. The only scene of interest was the suicide bomber who changed his mind and the resulting consequence. I think the only reason this won Best Picture was due to the sympathy for the current war."
2,LOW BUDGET DRAMA,"I don't understand when people said this movie deserved the Oscar for Best Picture/ Director, it was just and OK movie,OK acting, nothing WOW about it. I rented it to find out what was all the fuzz about it, got bored, it is a low budget drama."
3,It's ok,"I watched this wanting an experience like Black Hawk Down I didn't get that with this film. I don't know how or what would have salvaged the script it started out promising but to me quickly fell flat. For instance, fairly early on with the main character I didn't care if he got himself blown to bits or not and there was no one else to connect to. IMO it's watch able no question but I never got caught up in the story line or any of the characters so it's nothing I'm going to run out and buy."
2,"Not really worth seeing, but don't pay money to see it.","This movie was all right, didn't deserve the Oscar, but meh, it was ok. It's a war movie that will be completely forgotten within a year, maybe two. That said, Nicholas Chartier, the moron who produced this film has waged war on Net privacy and neutrality. He's suing anyone who downloaded this movie and thinks that all peopl who stream or torrent films are thieves. Like Metallica, the guys a petty idiot that can't recognize the difference between theft and copyright infringment.I deeply regret paying money to rent this movie partially because it's a forgettable film but mostly because that money went to Nicholas Chartier.A movie best skipped, but if you're going to watch it, torrent it or obtain it via some other method that doesn't put any money in Nicholas Chartier's pocket. And boycott all future films he's involved in. Maybe he'll go away."
4,Good but tough to watch,I would recommend it for anyone who does not mind a good tear-jerker! Although I have not have many first-hand experiences with military life and what it can do to people I could appreciate that this was written and directed by a woman. It really breeches the male psyche.
4,entertaining flick,"i'm formerly of the Marine Corps and an iraqi war vet. this movie does well to capture the look and feel of iraq. there are many technical and tactical flaws in the movie. but, for the sake of entertainment, movies often need to deviate from ""how it is"". it is entertaining. i enjoyed Sgt. James' character. again, there's really no need for emotionally unstable cowboys especially in the EOD field. but, it worked for the big screen. i enjoyed watching this movie several times and do recommend it for it's entertainment value. do not look for too much in the way of tactical value. take it for what it is."
3,A different look at war,Hurt Locker was a film that offers a look into war not many of us ever see. we often think of a infantrymen in wartime. This movie focus is primarily on bomb disposal units.
5,This is a fantastic movie!! Absolutely not only a must see but a must own!,Movie is delivered with great acting and shows the human drive to do what you love even if you have to sacrifice a lot to do it. I could get more into with the action and the warfare but that alone makes it a must own!
1,Not worth the time,"This is a long, dull movie with just a hint of action and suspense. The cover and promos would lead you to believe that this film is full of action, but don't be fooled. It's slow, weak, and tiresome."
1,Don't waste your time,"A real shame this movie promised so much but delivered so little. The producer is trying to sue good Americans like you and me, people who actually work for a living. Get a free copy from Netflix like I did if you must watch this trash."
1,bad company,I regret ever rooting for this movie during the oscars. I rented this on redbox for free and I was going to buy the blu-ray but not anymore! stop punishing people for your failure of a movie!
1,Low Quality,"This movie was very grainy & slow to load. I couldn't even watch it,kept buffering and would paly & freeze."
2,Hollywood at War,"As a professional soldier I was disappointed by this movie. There was so much that was wrong with it. You destroy IEDs in place, you don't disarm them. The out of control antics would not be put up with as other soldiers would avoid such a uncontrolled character because he would get you and your buddies killed. I just don't know what all the fuss is about this director - other than the look and feel for downrange - she got it all wrong. This is not the definitive movie on operations in Iraq or Afghanistan."
5,Deseved to win best picture,This was a very good independent movie. Jeremy Renner was very good.Very god drama. Actors acted well. Had intense scences and it showed you want people in the armedd forces have to go through to disarm bombs. Worth getting and seeing.
4,Very good but no private Ryan,I liked this movie but not enough to give it 5 stars. Still well worth watching but it didn't hold me like Black Hawkdown or Saving Private Ryan did. Still if you haven't seen it and on the fence go for it and watch it.
5,Amazing,The movie is amazing I recommend you watch it. It's one of the best war movies I have seen. Jeremy renner is amazing
1,Overrated and boring.,"I cannot believe this movie won ANY awards. It was slow-paced, boring, and did not represent an actual EO officer's life at all. This movie was a piece of garbage and you would do well to avoid it. Did you like Jarhead? If you did - then get this movie. If you didn't - you're better off re-watching Black hawk Down."
1,Hurts so Bad,"This movie is an absolute waste of time. I thought it was going to be awesome because it won an Oscar, but it is just the same old Hollywood dribble. I don't know how it beat Avatar for best film. OH wait, the producer emailed all his hollywood friends begging them to vote for his film."
1,Not even worth downloading this film,I tried really hard to get into this film. It was beautifully shot and the acting was good as well. I had a hard time discerning the point and felt the story was weak.
2,"Great video and audio, but no resemblance to reality","The filmmakers alleged that they set out to make a movie about the war in Iraq. In this they failed miserably. The vets who have been there or in any other conflict panned it for good reason. The redeeming qualities are the picture on the screen and the audio track. Here an exemplary job has been done. It is difficult to believe that much of the film was shot on 16mm.This movie more closely resembles 'Call of Duty' or other war games than it does the actual Iraq war. However, it does have pretty pictures."
2,"Predictable,","I did not watch the whole thing, which is unusual. I found the characters irritatingly two dimensional. The ""hero"" was just a tool who would not last 8 seconds in a real military organization. Whilst it never claimed to present the insurgent side of the engagement, the fact that these people were presented as stereotypical ""bad guys"": did not do much to present a thought provoking or interesting movie."
3,It's Preachy,"This was a preachy movie -- not the obvious ""War is Terrible"" message, but something like -- ""the main character is incredibly brave and selfless but it's only because he likes the adrenaline rush."" That's a very strange notion and not convincing, at least not to me. Still, the movie is somewhat entertaining . ."
1,Hollywood Hype,"Apolitical? Not a chance! Realistic? Far from it! Purchased by a friend for me, it saddens me to know that this tripe received their hard earned money.With great movies about real life available to include Brothers At War, At War, and Lone Survivor, and a story worth telling that is far more real (EOD) and exciting, it is an injustice to Our Troops, that this one is put up as ""realistic"" or ""apolitical.""Hollywood loves it. Warriors know the truth. Wait for Lone Survivor to see the true face of Our Troops, of Our Current Conflicts. [...]"
1,b sT,To much bias to the US. The loose cannon should be court martialled. They claim its not political? It reeks of ploitics.
1,So So Wrong,"This movie was horrible. No wonder the Soldier the movie is about is suing. I would too. They made his character completely reckless. The very first scene has a humvee driving through the crowded streets of Baghdad all alone, no convoy. My husband, who has been to Iraq twice for a total of 25 months, was livid. He said no way do you go out alone! That was just the beginning of extremely inaccurate circumstances. Don't waste your time, and if you do, don't think this is the real deal."
2,Incomplete order,Received the DVD in more than average mailing time. I received the DVD in just a plain wrapper taped to a piece of cardboard and NOT in the commercial DVD case with the full color promotional/descriptive liner. Had I known I was going to get just the DVD I would have shopped elsewhere. Nowhere was there a description that said DVD only!
1,Absolutely Terrible Movie,"This is absolutely one of the worse war movies ever made. Having served for 37 years as a Soldier and Army Civlian, I saw numerous inaccuracies. Other reviewers have pointed them out. The basic plot jumped from one scene to the next with no sense at all. Big example, at the end when the two main stars are riding in the Humvee in Iraq; then the next scene, SSG James is pushing a grocery cart in a supermarket. Did they go back home? They kept showing on the screen that the Unit had X number of days left in their rotation. They should have had some kinda of departure ceremony one would think, but nothing. The Director needs to let her ex do the movies!A much better war movie from years ago is ""Go Tell the Spartans"". Now there is an excellent war movie (Vietnam)."
1,This Movie Hurt My Brain!!!,"The only thing hurting after watching this is my brain!!! Can I please get my 2 hours back?If anyone who has watched this movie has spent anytime in or around the military (as I have), they know that this is way over-the-top...even for Hollywood. The movie didn't make me feel for the characters, and the ending was so predictable.The pacing is off...ex: when the young soldier sees the enemy at their rear when they are pinned down...he took too long to shoot they guy...get real!! ex: WHENEVER the new guy is disarming a bomb he takes too long!!Whoever made this movie needs to go back to film school. I hate being this critical, but this movie really does HURT!!!"
1,Boring and pointless,"Fence-riding ideological pretense masquerading as conflict psychology. The premise behind the plot has been done before, only better. It will be done again, only better. Don't waste your time on this movie."
2,Movie was OK but not great,"Personally I thought the movie was not very realistic and drawn out. I didn't find it particularly engaging. Based on reviews, I expected it to be much better.It is ironic that the film is getting so much notoriety now due to the BitTorrent lawsuit. My guess is that there are some sour grapes there from the producer having a film that was critically acclaimed but a flop in the box office. I can think of some others that fall into the same category. Get over it Voltage. Personally I don't condone or use BitTorrent, but I think Voltage needs to go down in the annals of failed companies given that they can't accept a lackluster film's performance and, instead, believe it is someone else's fault.If you want a thriller look elsewhere. Several other genres do that much better. If you are looking for accuracy, then definitely go elsewhere. If you want OK entertainment then the movie will accomplish that."
5,A must-see film,An amazingly visceral and potent look at war its costs. Expert direction and stunning cinematography. A film that manages to be suspenseful and thrilling but at the same time sober and unromantic. A truly great film.
1,Terrible Camera Shake,"My wife and I watched maybe 15 minutes and gave up. There was so much shaky camera work we were feeling sick. I will never understand the reasoning for filming a movie with all this unnecessary camera movement, panning around, rapid zooming in/out. It's like it was filmed by a 10 year old. I should have taken $25 and thrown it down the toilet!Even the scenes where nothing was moving; the camera was bouncing around. This stuff absolutely sucks. I'd rate this a zero if it were possible."
1,The Movie is Virulently Anti-Military,The Hurt Locker is a movie which is Virulently Anti-Military! I should of known that Hollywood could almost never make a War film that shows the courage and honor of our volenteer men and women in arms. If you despise those who die and bleed for our freedom then you will certainly like this film.
1,"Lousy, slow, redundant.","Who ENJOYS movies like this? It's no Strange Days (also by Bigelow), which was original and well-acted. Pretentious, dull, too long."
1,Pass this one by....quickly,"Do Not Buy This Movie ! What a waste!! Three reasons to avoid this film: 1. It was directed by a clueless woman. 2. It only grossed 12 mil at the boxoffice and 3. The never fails, dead give-away for lame movies: The critics liked it. They could have been honest by putting those perennial losers Julia Roberts and Jennifer Anniston in camo bdu's, surrounding them with the usual cadre of beta-males and having a good "" Hope and Change"" cry-in under a humvee. If you're looking for a good military/war action movie...this ain't it. This chopped-up, silly and altogether useless story is an affront to every member of our heroic military. What else can you expect from hollywood. Three strikes...they're out."
2,Typical Hollywood trash..,"pretending to be realistic. What this really is is a political bore of a movie. It is neither entertaining nor educational. Here you have the same stereotypical characters in other war depictions...a black guy, a wimpy guy, and a smug gung-ho guy who has a soft spot. It is dreary and not at all suspenseful. Don't waste your time."
2,just a B movie,"It was cowboy movie full of bulls*** and cow manuer. I bought the movie because of Oscars, did not live-up. Bad but watchable. Politices is the only thang I can think of why this movie won an Oscar(so what's new)."
2,Military propaganda,"Entertaining and interesting story. But i'm tired of these propaganda films which tend to attract kids to go to war, where dying for such a cause is an honor. Somebody should make a movie showing the big business these wars are for some corporations and stock holders' profits. Where kids are taken and sacrificed for that real reason."
2,Bomb Squad Movie Defused By Overblown Hype,"This is Iraq, Hollywood style, where the cocky hotshot teams with the I'm-getting-too-old-for-this guy, with the seeing-a-shrink sidekick along for the ride. There's no boredom in this war, just daily ""do I cut the red wire or the blue wire"" tension. The opening sequence is excellent. After that, it becomes highly predictable and formulaic, which a war movie, like life, shouldn't be.I give the movie credit for cutting out the politics. Too bad there's little character development, beyond a sequence of the guys punching each other in the gut."
5,Top Rate Modern War Film!!,"Arguably the best modern war film out there, and definitely among the best war films of any kind that I've seen (and its a respectable list). Not sure why it got some bad reviews on here... maybe people were expecting some hidden treasure to be found in some ancient Iraqi ruin to add a sufficient level of cheese to it. This movie was powerful and does a great job reminding us of the dangers the men and women in the military face abroad."
3,My wife might divorce me for this review,"This movie is vastly overrated. Don't expect much of a narrative, as it is basically a character study of an uninteresting character. There is nothing wrong with that just don't expect much plot driven momentum. Nothing about this film is really bad, nor is it exceptional. It settles nicely into the crevice of mediocrity that everyone seems so keen on. I'm not saying don't watch it. Just don't tell me it's gold. There are just too many good war movies out there for you to settle on this one. My wife thinks this is a great movie so I gave it 3 stars to save my marriage. I'd actually subtract half a star based on my real opinion... and then subtract 2 more based on the opinions of others who are fueling the hype train like it's the first full color movie with talking they have ever seen."
1,Terrible Movie,"I was expecting this movie to be amazing because of the awards it won, but after I watched it I coudent believe what a horrible movie this was. I have no idea how this garbage beat Avatar. I will never take those awards seriously again as I can now see they are just a bunch of BS. I suggest that if you really want to watch this garbage, to rent it or get it for under 4$ because no way its worth a purchase."
1,Overrated and not all true,"Just a bad movie - overrated and over hyped. Even real life military say so much is untrue and ""Hollywood Hype"". No wonder it did poorly at the box office."
2,Reality Check,"I have been working in Iraq for 2 years directly with the soldiers. This movie played several times at the theater here on base. When I asked the soldiers what they thought about the movie the general concensus was ""Typical Hollywood Cowboy stuff nowhere near reality"""
1,From a veteran this is a fake depiction of iraq,Please see this movie knowing that everything they do here is fake. EOD does not go out on their own. We have ROE and standards our professionals abide by and not this wild west crap. I saw this while I was in Iraq and it is a load of crap. This is a disgrace to the men and women serving our nation and should only be seen with a realization that this movie is based on fiction and not what our soldiers are going through in Iraq.
1,I don't know what the hype was all about,"This movie does not deserve to be the best movie of 2009. It does not even deserve to be among the nominated. If you enjoy seeing people disarm bombs, then that is the movie for you. The only tension in the movie is to see if and when the bombs will go off while being disarmed. Nothing else happens in the movie. There is no story line whatsoever. Watching this movie is like watching the grass grow."
2,Very overrated film,I went into The Hurt Locker very excited to see a well received war film. I usually love war films and was hoping to see one covering the modern wars. I have to say THL had no point and had horrible acting. I just couldn't identify with any of the characters in the least. You just watch a guy disarm bombs and people seem to think this is a great character study for it. You need an interesting character to make a great character study. All of the characters in this movie are cardboard cutouts..
2,Mediocre at best,Grossly overrated by Hollywood elite who hate the war in Iraq but want to applaud a war movie to appear patriotic. Think of this as a decent documentary with a disjointed script and maybe you won't be disappointed.
1,This won Best Picture??,"I cannot believe that this movie won Best Picture. What was the Academy thinking??? The writing was poor, the acting mediocre at best. The action in this film was very predictable and not suspenseful. I was VERY disappointed with this film. I am glad I rented it before I purchased it. I would not recommend this film for purchase. It simply is not worth the money. The most absurd part was one of the last scenes, where the ""doc"" was trying to get some locals to move their cart... you knew he was going to get it in the end.. are people that stupid?? Come on.. where is the credibility here? While the story is okay for the most part, I am sure this film does not do justice to what our soldiers actually go through in the field. I support our troops, but I cannot support the poor quality and judgement of the film makers of this film."
1,The most boring movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am amazed to see how many people thought this was a good movie...poor plot, predictable, bad acting, bad directing, and super boring. This movie must have some weird hypnotic powers to control people's minds into believing it is great! Poor James Cameron who got screwed by his ex-wife with this crappy movie. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!"
1,"A rancid, over-hyped piece of junk","Why did everybody and I mean everybody make such a big deal about how great this was when it came out. I didn't find a single person that disliked the film in the first 6 months. Now it seems people are seeing the light and this film for what it is. There is almost no plot, the characters are simple and hateful and apart from the locations that look pretty good the film is a disaster.Honestly, I wanted them all to die after just a few minutes. This film does nothing for either the art of film or the men and woman fighting in Iraqistan.I would give zero stars if possible."
3,Overrated,I was waiting to rent this movie online but decided on buying the film once the blu-ray price came down. The movie was good but best picture? I don't think so. Should have waited.
1,didn't cut it,"Thought this movie was awful. After all the hype I was really hoping for a great OIF movie, I was so disappointed. Not worth watching or owning."
2,Rent It!,"First of all, I have nothing but the highest respect for our troops no matter where they serve. I rented this movie and I'm glad I did instead of buying. Aside from a lot of good special effects, this movie and it's plot goes little beyond a 2 hour TV mini series or one night special. I am mystified by it's Oscar status as it does not deserve to be on the same DVD shelf with movies like Saving Private Ryan or or any episode from the Combat! TV series from the 60's. I guess the movie industry ain't what it used to be."
1,And another...,"I'm a veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan and while I don't expect movies to have to always be like the real thing (which would actually be horrible), you can't claim that a movie is the real thing and then get away with it.I heard an interview with the lead actor on NPR as this film was coming out. He was talking about the stress of filming it, how he would go to his hotel each night and shake, how when he got home, people didn't understand and I wanted to laugh. What an idiot. If he thinks that is tough, he should go and do it for real and see how he feels.The fact that this film won an Oscar speaks voulmes to how Hollywood sees war. A hollywood lens.This movie disrespects not only EOD, but veterans everywhere. It is a complete joke and isn't even a good film in its own right.Much better films have been made about war. It behooves you to find them. Avoid this and all the hype."
3,A character piece inside a war movie,"Good acting, good directing, and a good film all around The Hurt Locker doesn't prove to be the most accurate war movie ever made but does hold up a good light to modern war movies. It becomes more of a character peice than a war movie near the end but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. On the same level as Jarhead if not a bit below this is a movie worth renting but unless you collect war movies it doesnt need to be bought."
2,Goodbye to romance,"Wolverine has found his perfect match (The Naitive), and as always Sabretooth wants to spoil his fun, by killing his girldfriend.The story does not show anything new, we have seen better battles between Wolvy and Sabretooth, and like I said before she's not the first girlfriend on the run.Naitive the caracter that gives porpuse to the story is far from original, as a matter of fact it's just another she-wolveriene wanna-be.Wolverine has been drawn by some of the best artist in the field, this is far from the case, if you want a cool Wolverine (one with a costume), look for Marc Silvestri or Kubert."
3,Fascinating exploration of the process of creating - but not his best book,"I've read all three of Fritz's main books on the creative process (I consider the ""for managers"" book to be a spin-off, though I haven't read it so far and I could be wrong), and I've found this the least informative and unique.It's still a fascinating look at Fritz's unique and powerful process, and it contains many useful tidbits and thought-provoking questions. But much of what's said here is also said in ""The Path of Least Resistance"" and then developed further in ""Your Life as Art."" So if you have limited reading time or book budget, focus on those two and skip this one.On the other hand, if you're as intrigued by Fritz's principles as I am (or if you're just a book junkie, as I am!), this is still well worth reading."
2,I don't expect much from romance novels,"Romance novels are, at their base and beyond, a genre of fiction for escapism. You don't read a romance novel to read about the day-to-day of your average Jane and John. You don't read romance novels because they'll make you a better person or open your eyes to cruel injustice. You read romance novels because you have a few days and want a nice little break from the world.If you have any knowledge of English grammar at all, you won't get that break. The editing of this book is absolutely appalling. Verb tenses change back and forth like you'd expect to see in a rushed first draft. There are spelling errors and incorrect paragraph breaks, and it's absolutely maddening to read. Any and all reasons for loving or hating romance novels aside, the sheer lack of effort that was made to make this book readable disqualifies it from my personal list of ""read agains""."
4,"black and white, good cardstock, easier than it looks","mt rushmore has fascinated me for years, especially hearing from other people visiting it. thot this puzzle would let me appreciate it, like I am constructing the monument myself!i don't think this is available any longer.the cardstock is very good quality. i only had one ""head"" flutter apart.it's easier than i thot it would be, and i will keep it to build again."
1,Wrong title for this book.,"I have many books on herbal medicinces, some better than others for sure. This book, Essential Herbal Medicine is greatly mistitled. I was very disappointed at both the content and style. It seems it is more against herbal medicine, preferring to use pharmaciticle terms instead of natural healing terms. Almost no first hand knowledge presented; furthermore if you were to search for these herbs it would be a worldwide adventure, not your backyard or local park.There are many other books that far surpass this one if you are really looking to find herbs for health and healing everyday.I am greatly disappointed with this book, mostly because of it's claims both in title and back page."
4,An original sequel,"First things first-""Veritas"" is different from ""Hostile Witness"",i.e. it's NOT a courtroom drama. Say what you want,but this is a brave move for the author(can you remember another series with novels belonging to different sub-genres?).""Veritas"" is Victor Carl playing Philp Marlowe.It's a really good novel with lots of interesting characters(including Beth,who is back working with Victor).The only drawback is that Victors mind isn't as sharp as Marlowes,so it sometimes takes him forever to come to raver obvious conclusions.I liked ""Hostile Witness"" better,but this one is still good.I admire Lashner for writing noir novel instead of another courtroom drama,but,to be honest, I hope the next one will be the latter."
2,"""Veritas"" has all the elements of a good read, it isn`t","Veritas has all the elements of a truly good lawyer/client story. It does not however, deliver on those promises. I`m sure the author tried to deliver but got blocked, or did not know where to go, and used tired plot devices to make the story work. The absolute absurdity of the story is the only thing that saves it from becoming pointless. I feel that this author is talented but his editors did not require him to use his skills as a writer more effectively. The other thought is that this author is writing of subjects he`s really not comfortable or qualified to write about. I do know someone who will enjoy this novel due to it`s absurdity, and will pass it on."
1,Ephemeral UV Light,"While I was very pleased with the 1st 6 months of service, I now find the Ionic Breeze to be completely useless. After 6 months the UV light burned out and there is no benefit to running it at all. It remains unplugged and every time I look at it I wonder how I could have spent my money in a better way."
4,Country-Rock for the soul!,"Moodier and darker than his 2 earlier albums, but still filled with the great mix of country, rock and whatever's in-between that has made Kevin Johnson one of my favorite bands of the last several years. Fave songs here: ""Written On My Heart"" (the best contracts in life are the unwritten ones), ""She Changed The Country Station"" (is rock & roll less painful than country?), ""Blue Train"" (anybody want to ride?), ""Miss Lonelyhearts Out On The Town"" (how long 'til her heart stops hurting?), ""Disintegrating Heart"" (the hardest-rocker here!), ""La"" (somehow this brings up visions of a slow horseback ride across the prairie-- even if it's really a mysterious love song), and ""Buckskin Stallion Blues"" (about the aftermath of a break-up, which somehow manages to be the most ""upbeat"" song on the disc!). For anyone who likes this, I'd also recommend Michael Nesmith, Rolling Hayseeds, Dash Rip Rock and Commander Cody!"
4,Heavy duty,No frills exactly what you are expecting. Was hoping for a little better / aggressive pricing but this seems fairly heavy duty and does the job.
4,"Good, but could be better","I was looking for a bag to haul laundry in. I have alot of laundry. Other backpack bags I have purchased only lasted about 10 uses before the material split or ripped. I bought this bag because it looked well made. It is a wonderful bag for hauling laundry. This sucker will never rip. My problem is that you have to sling it over one shoulder, and at 5'5 it dangles at the backs of my legs. I often have to carry it in my arms or on my hip, and that isn't working out. So I recently purchased a luggage cart that I will attach it to so it will roll. If that works out, this bag will work just fine. So, in closing...I like this bag, but if it was a bit smaller and had dual straps so I could wear it as a backpack, it would get five stars. But overall, I'm satisfied."
4,"Sturdy, but weak organic hook.","The bag could fit a child in it, easily. Also, it is very sturdy. My only problem is that the hook which is organic to the bag is not effective, so you will need a lock."
3,Cool duffle bag for traveling,"The small size is HUGE, so don t even think about bigger, unless you want to store a dead body...It is a solid bad, but you ll struggle to get something in the bottom of the bag once it s full."
5,I love this bag!!,I love this bad. It was perfect for my trip to the Ukraine and I would advise anyone looking for a tough and plain looking bag to buy this one.
1,Clasp broke after 2nd use,"The inner tongue of the clasp broke the second time I used the bag, making it useless. Both times I was using it to carry laundry; it was not completely full, the laundry was not packed tight or unusually heavy, and in any case there is little direct stress on the inner tongue. This seems like an overpriced piece of junk. I do not plan to buy from this supplier again.On the other hand, this the second duffle bag I bought from this supplier; the first (3339 OLIVE DRAB TOP LOAD CANVAS DUFFLE BAG 21 X 36) is a bit smaller, has been in use longer, and has no problems. I have bought other Rothco products from other sources which had no problems."
4,battery tender,This is a super cool gift for my husband. He got it for fathers day and was very happy to see something that looked like it belonged in the same garage as his Harleys
5,A Beautiful Book of Shadows,"This is a beautiful hard cover book. An awesome journal, filled with enough pages and space to write and do whatever you need to do with it. The book is large, well made and durable. I do recommend making your own BOS, but this one is great."
5,Must Buy!!!,I bought this product and it is very good. its durable and lightweight. perfect for pagans on the run. I just got it in the mail a few days ago and cant wait to fill it so I can buy another.
5,Non-fiction on Huazhou China- Guangdong Province,"This book is intended for children who lived in the Huazhou Social Welfare Institute, in Huazhou, China.It provides an overview of their hometown, with brief descriptions of Huazhou's sub-towns, to help them visualize their finding locations. Most of the city-related details were translated with permission from Huazhou's official website, by LionBridge Corporation."
1,Too complicated!! Not a good book for students,"Each case study requires too specific knowledge. The content is not very well-organized and it is so confusing. Difficult to understand. You will not get the point of how to do engineering design from this book. Don't recommend.!!! Waste time, waste money!!"
4,Its ok,I didnt know that I was going to have to nearly break my hands trying to stretch this cover on my wheel and then wrap around this cord. It didnt look right when I finished wrapping it. I was dissapointed at first but I changed my mind when I started driving around with it on. It has a nice feeling. Im just a picky person and have to have everything perfect so if youre not perfect then forget what I said lol.
2,Accel ignition module for Geo Storm SOHC,"I installed the Accel 35362 control module in a 1991 Geo Storm with the SOHC engine. It worked fine after the engine was running, but caused it to stumble and be generally hard to start.I drove the car daily for two weeks with the unit installed hoping the problem would go away but it did not.After replacing the Accel unit with the stock module the car started with no problems."
3,Didn't fix my Geo's problem.,Bought this to hopefully fix my Geo Storms intermittent ignition problem. Hoped this was the problem but it wasnt. It may have run a little smoother with this but hard to tell. Next thing is a new engine computer.
2,scooby Doo leapster,"This game is too simple in nature. There are three levels which indicate that the addition question just gets slightly harder. There is only one very simple repetative main game, throwing food at the monster with the correct answer and a simple round of eating snacks before the timer runs out. Other Leapster games are more elaborate. The kids are not interested in this one because there isn't much to it. When you buy online it is hard to read the box and deduce the game details. I got it on sale for about half price, at least."
2,Disappointing for a Leapster game,"We have quite a few Leapster game and this is by far the worst. The others have several games to choose from; this has just one. I got this for my Scooby Doo- obsessed five-year old and he was bored after a few minutes. He hasn't played it since the first time. He kept looking for other things to do, but all you can do is feed Scooby or Shaggy snacks over and over. Other games we love for Leapster: Cars, Up, Number Raiders, & Nemo."
5,Gotta love Scooby Doo!,My children love this game as they do all the Leapster games. It provides fun & eduacational learning.
4,Rich Baritone,"Arthur Prysock has a really lovely, rich baritone voice and sings all the religious songs very movingly. I am glad to now have this CD since hearing one song 15 years ago. I will treasure it."
5,"Taste great, but had expiration date within 7 Weeks","Taste great, but had expiration date within 7 Weeks.I may try simply powdered milk next time, but then again I may do a re-buy of this"
2,cost of shipping,"the item was not what we wanted, item discription not informative enough.Also it costs as much to ship the item (which weighed ounces)as it was to buy it...item cost around 5-6 dollars same amount to ship...sell cheap and over charge for shipping... wont buy again... n.clark"
1,Waste of money for the content!,"The contect is borring. No art or animation, not even slides to highlight any key topic. It looks like a student presemtation on class but without any value just a homework of a student. Not professional at all."
4,Interesting,"As a daughter of a Civil War officer, this is very interesting. Good and well written letters to home. Like"
1,Deer stags don't wear well,My son wore these to his Christmas concert at school and they got really scuffed up. They looked horrible after only one wear.
2,not happy!,"I am happy with this product. It is Not accurate sizing,and they run more narrow and smaller then the normal sizing in toddlers shoes ."
3,"so, so","The reason I bought these shoes was to have a nice, slip-on pair of church shoes for my 5 year old. They are slip-on, however they do fit a little snug. Also the top of the toes already show wear, so will have to take a black marker and try to make them still look good. I would say they are just so, so for the price."
5,UP THE ORGANIZATION,"NOT SINCE COLLEGE,HAVE I HAD THE PLEASURE TO READ A MANAGEMENT TOOL THAT ENCOMPASSES PROPER BUSINESS MANAGEMENT FOR AN ORGANIZATION OF ANY SIZE. STEVEN SHAW BECOMES, AS YOU READ THIS SPELL BINDER, YOUR MENTOR,TEACHER,FRIEND AND BROTHER. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. THIS SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR M.B.A. STUDENTS. BESIDES BEING ACTION PACKED, IT TEACHES MANAGERS HOW TO TREAT SUBORDINANTS AND SUCCEED. IT'S NICE TO BE IMPORTANT BUT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO BE NICE. THANKS STEVE SULLIVAN !!"
1,Don't buy unless you read Japanese!,"I was intrigued by the title of this book and the subject matter, however, I was greatly disappointed when the book arrived as it is written entirely in Japanese. The only thing in English is the title."
4,Engrossing IMHO,"Having run out of books in another series, I turned to Mechwarrior:Dark Ages to tide me over. I am not proud, but a man has to do what a man has to do. Anyway, I confess to enjoying them, but let's be honest, they are not fine literature. I enjoy that I can read a few pages or chapters and put them down...that is until this one. For some reason, I couldn't put it down. Yes, the villain is about as big a stereotype as you will ever find, but the situation and story were different from the others.So four stars. I enjoyed it more than that, but my my degree in literature and self-respect simply won't let me score it that high."
1,Don't buy atleast EZ series of Casio Digital camera,I personally don't suggest Casio camera. My experience is very bad with this. It can simply work in good lighting for still photographs.Movies quality is really pathetic.There is no socket for AV out.There is no provision for datetime stamp on photograph.Not really worth.
1,Terrible,I have 275 opera dvds and this is the worst I have ever seen. There is no one that even resembles Montazuma. It looks as if it were staged in a French drawing room. A typical example of Euro trash.
3,"Barely worth it, but worth it nonetheless.","We are five in my family and we each have at least one Mac (yeah, we're lucky like that). So the family pack seems liek a perfect fit for us.The best part: online address book access, editing, syncing and sharing.The iDisk is a nice way to share big files and the recent storage bump is very welcome and was badly needed.I have a Mac mini at home that's always on and I'm looking forward to the Back To My Mac feature in Leopard, which will make .Mac so much better.I don't have the new iLife nor an iPhone so I'm missing out on some features... for now.If .Mac was cheaper, I would recommend it for sure. As it stands, I need to think hard every year before I renew."
2,Same issues as others,"My son got this game for his birthday and we just ran into the issue that other people have: 2 of the 4 games are locked up because ???? I guess he used those too much?If they want kids to vary in the games, they should not give them to option- obviously they didn't include enough space on the cartridge for more play in those games. I am wondering what happens when he continues to just play the other games. Does the whole thing shut off? For $25, this game seems VERY limited. Maybe including so many graphics limits the amount of actual game that fits on the card. My son is only 5 btw."
2,No real learning unless a child makes mistakes - limited games.,"The game is fun initially - but after some play - some games no longer are an option. We haven't rescued all the animals, and yet - we can't play the Matching game, OR the Features game. Stuck using the Maze and Scratch games to find the rest.And, no animal facts are given unless the child makes an error - no learning takes place until the child 'unlocks' an animal.Oh well.. good to pass time, but there are much better Leapster games to spend money on - this ones entertainment and learning value is limited - VERY limited."
3,Great game until...,"I bought this for my 4.5 year old son, who is a huge animal lover. He absolutely loved the game at first and the educational value was terrific. However, as others have said, once you get to a certain point in the game, 2 out of 4 of the mini games stop working. Unfortunately for my son, the two games that no longer worked were his favorites. Not sure why the game has this feature, and like others, I thought that there was a problem with the game at first. At this point, he is just signing in as ""guest"" so that he can play the mini games he likes. However, this definitely takes away the sense of accomplishment since he can't ""earn"" all of the best on a guest account."
1,Some MAJOR BUGS,"I gave this to my 6yr yesterday for his birthday. He loved playing the game...when it worked. Within 1 hour of playing, 2 of the games on the cartridge were disengaged or locked up. He couldn't access them anymore. Initially I thought he had done something to the cartridge but, after some research online, I discovered that many people have had the same problems with Animal Genius. Some have even reported 3 out of the 4 games being locked after 2 to 4 animals were identified (which doesn't take long). I wish I would have done more research before purchasing this game, but I never expected I would have to do such a thing, especially for a game costing over [...]?! Although this game is educational and fun for children, save your money for something that gives more game time. I am highly disappointed Leapster would put out such a poor quality item, not to mention not fixing a bugged game still being sold to unsuspecting, well meaning parents."
2,Blank Screens,"My 4 year old loves it,(Would be 4 or 5 stars) until 2 out of the 4 games stop working (Matchomatic & Feature Finder) I actually thought the game had to be defective so I returned it for another. It turns out this isn't a defect! When you first start, you get to choose between 4 games (Maze Munch, Scratch & See, Feature Finder & Matchomatic) After a few levels, if you choose Matchomatic or Feature Finder, all you get is a blank screen. It appears that it's ""frozen"" but you can go back by pressing the B button. My son get's frustrated when he can no longer play those games so we have to start all over."
5,wonderful game for animal lovers!,my son and I both love this game. He really likes the maze game and I like that he is learning facts about animals while having fun. Definitely a great leapster game this is my son's favorite so far!!!
3,Great game but,Purchased this fame for my daughter who is age 4. She really likes the game and has a lot of fun with it. But there is no warning that once you play so much (which is not very long) some of the mini games stop working. I thought the game was broke until I read what other reviewers had to say. Also the game instructions tell you that the game gives you the information to answer the questions to win the animal but I haven't heard the answers while she has been playing the game. I usually help her with the questions b/c some are too advanced for her age -- but it does help her learn.
3,too easy if your child knows their animals.,Bought this thinking my daughter who just finished kindergarten would enjoy it. Wrong. She complains it is too easy and I agree. She knows all the animal facts and breezes through the game. My 4 year old niece enjoys it and finds it more challenging.
5,Nice learning game,"My kids enjoy watching animal programs, and this is a very nice learning game about animals. The game is divided into zones (ocean/grassland/arctcic etc), and each zone has animals that the kids has to 'win'. Winning an animal involves playing games about it, answering rapidfire questions etc. The whole process is fun, and the kids learn a lot - they have been teaching me some! Only drawback is that after this entire leapster game is played once, the kids lose interest in it. I guess that is true of most games though."
5,Very good game for my 3 year old grandson,My 3 1/2 year old grandson was very happy with this game. He learned it quickly and enjoyed playing it. I consider this a highly educational game and was pleased with how much fun it was for him to learn and play.
5,Excellent game,"This is one of the best Leapster games I've yet to see. My daughter is 3.5 yrs old and this game is perfect for her. Some of the other Leapster games feel a bit too old for her, just by about a year. This is a great place to begin. Not only is it good for younger kids but it's also very educational - but still a lot of fun! My daughter usually plays the level 1 games, but I can see how an older child would be able to find enough of a challenge playing this game on level 2 or 3.There are a lot of fun games packed into Animal Genius, and literally, in just a few weeks, it really does seem like my daughter is becoming one!We have Diego, Princess letters and numbers, Backyardigans, and Kai Lan and by far, this is the best game for where my daughter is ""at"" right now. Definitely a good one to add to your childs Leapster library."
3,Only one problem,As someone has mentioned once your child gets so many animals the higher point games just stop working and you are left with two games instead of four. I am really not impressed with that feature of the game. Like many people have said this game is more for 3-5 not much older than that because it is very simple. My 5 yr old has 3 of the 5 habitats complete in a day. It is a great game for little kids and it holds thier attention for long periods of time.
4,cute and entertaining,My son loves this game. He is very interested in animals and does not want to put this down. He is 7 so I was worried it would be to young for him based on what other reviewers said.
4,Don't think twice...this is a great Leapster item,Of all my daughters 6 games this is her favorite. She loves the animal facts and games that make this such a great buy. I search Amazon specifically for the Leapster games and am so impressed with what you get for the price.Just do it. Girl or boy this is a wonderful choice!
1,BEWARE!!!,"Beware!! this does not work for Leapster Explorer, false advertising on the part of the seller. The picture's on this website show the item as Working With All Leapster Systems. Well.... when i got mine in the mail it says something completly different!! In the bottom right hand corner it says; Works with Leapster, and Leapster 2. So annoyed! Got this right before Christmas and now I have to go find one in a store somewhere!! I really hope that this company changes their advertising! Such and inconvienence!!! The Game itself I am sure is great!"
1,Dead on Arrival,Christmas gift for 4 yo daughter. Leapster would not read the cartridge. 2 other new leapster games worked fine. Product was garbage and a real dissapointment. Especially given no returns for software...
3,OK,"I really did not use it much because my son did not like it, but it viberated very well under the mattress."
4,Could be your answer to sleepless nights,This product works well and did everything it promises Mommy just wasn't ready to put her baby in the crib!If you have a baby who loves the vibration of their bouncy seat or their virbating bassinett this will help you put them into the crib. I liked the heartbeat sound and the that you have volume options. The night light is a nice feature too.I will warn you that when we purchased this we thought it would keep going until we shut if off but it has an automatic shut off of about 10 minutes.
2,Works When It Wants,"I'm glad to see (sort of) that we're not the only ones that have been having problems with this product.It worked the first 4 days properly. (Be sure you use very Heavy Duty batteries for it to last more than 3 days) Then the vibrator unit stopped working.Now, it works off and on. When it's on, the baby goes back to sleep well. But it hardly turns on. Even when you manually operate it.There are (many) times that it won't work, even with fresh Duracell batteries and the control unit sitting right next to the vibrator unit.It's a very frustrating thing and I feel certainly not worth the money spent.If it worked as it's supposed to, then it would be a 5 star (or 4 because of the battery use). But unfortunately, the product just doesn't work 75% of the time. (vibration mode)The light is helpful and the music works well. But this is an expensive product if that's all you want."
1,Waste of money unless you want to spend every night fighting with it!!!,"The concept of this item is great. When it works, it is WONDERFUL!!! However, over the past year, my husband and I have spent more time fighting with this thing than it has spent working. It is very sensitive in the placement of the remote module to the vibration module. We go through batteries like crazy because every time they are even close to going dead we replace them. We can use those batteries in other products so I know they are not dead. Now the screw on the vibration unit's battery cover is stripped from replacing the batteries so much. So the vibration unit only works if I slam it down to get the batteries in there tight. The voice-activation seems to have completely stopped working. And to top it off, our baby has never learned to put himself back to sleep so when the unit acts up, no one is sleeping in our house!!!"
1,Never worked,"We purchased this since our 3 week old seems to be soothed by the vibrations in other products, and liked the fact that the vibrations could be triggered to start automatically if he awoke during the night and did not need a feeding. (our daughter slept in her swing for 9 months). The unit vibrated when we installed the batteries, however when we placed the unit on the crib, the vibrations never worked, but would work when you removed the vibrating unit from under the mattress to repostion it."
2,Vibrations only last for 10 minutes :-(((,"I thought that the vibrations and sounds would last for as long as you need them, but it didn't say anywhere in the description on Amazon that the unit shuts off after 10 minutes!!!! I needed a vibration unit not only to help my child fall asleep, but also to KEEP her asleep, which I can't do with this item. Also the vibrations are not gentle at all, it seems like my baby is riding on the tractor..."
1,Horrible proformance,"We have never been more frustrated with an item. The antenna had to be extended to almost touch the control panel or it wont work. The battery box had to be modified because they shake so much it stops working, the batteries arent held tight enough. Its just continually one thing or another with this item. We wish we had bought another item of better quality. When it works it does help him sleep.Wish we hadnt wasted our money on it!"
4,Great item!,"I bought this soother for the vibration feature, but I find myself using the heartbeat and crib light the most! It works great and my son sleeps much better with the extra ""help"" it provides.The only issue I have with it is that it's a bit of a pain to put batteries in the control piece."
4,great concept,"I brought this item for my newborn who constantly needed to be held. I thought the vibration would give him the illusion of being held. It doesn't work for putting him to sleep. However, it maintains his sleep. It has a function that turns on the motion when the baby moves. It is a great product and I would recommend it. Its sturdy and worth the money. My son is still fussy with it but...I think eventually he will grow to love it. Once we get my son to sleep, when we lay him down the stillness of the bed would not maintain his sleep. This product works great for that purpose. It saves us from getting out of the bed every few minutes to rock him back to sleep."
2,Was great while it worked,"As stated in other reviews, this item is great when it works. I mainly wanted this item for the vibration feature, but more than half the time it doesn't work. We replaced the batteries on both the crib attachment and the vibration device and it does not work. It is frustrating to say the least when you are trying to get a fussy baby to sleep and the mattress vibrates for 2 seconds, stops for 10 seconds, vibrates again for 3 seconds or just all together fails to ever start to vibrate. Great concept, horrible product!"
4,sleeping...finally!,Loved this device. It was so much easier to get my 3 month old back to sleep in the middle of the night by switching the vibration on.
2,Does not work well for us,"We have a very poor sleeper, and were hopeful this product would help him stay asleep longer at night. The vibrating feature does help my husband get him to sleep more quickly, but does not keep asleep any longer during the night. Also the batteries run down quickly.I think it might be more helpful for a very young baby."
5,A great product,I am so happy with this product It has been so helpful I did notice that other wireless products will block the transmission of the crib vibrator but it has been a great product and I am so happy with it
3,Good for getting my baby to sleep,I have not found any problems with the vibration unit.... my 10 week old baby would not sleep in her crib.. and this has really made her sleep well .
3,works intermittently,"This item worked so well when it was new it was like magic!However... The remote vibrator worked very nicely in the first few weeks and is now turning on and off at will when it should just be running. Wonderful idea, poor implementation. Going to return our unit for a refund, not an exchange."
4,"""Light"" Review!","This is a beautiful chandelier, I think it is a steal at the price it's being sold. The only problem is that the chain and wiring that comes along with it is very short, we are having a problem finding a matching chain for it."
5,Best book EVER!,"I just finished this book and I've got to say that it provided the best ten minutes worth of reading I've ever experienced! Before reading this I thought 'Curious George Flies a Kite' was never going to be surpassed. Still, this book would be alot better if my Auntie read it to me while I ate banana bread."
2,A Worthwhile Project,"I am sorry, but if someone needs to read a book in order to navigate a website, they do not belong on the internet. Kudos to Mr. Miller (no relation) for coming up with something for the truly needy."
5,AWESOME!,This film was great! It's got everything you want in a movie! It's a fun romantic- comedy / murder-mystery movie! Fantastic and fun for everyone!
5,great,we bought this to store our christmas tree in. it works great and sturdier than the bags sold for that purpose.
5,Big enough for almost anything!,We wanted this to pack three large sleeping bags. This is certainly big enough and rugged enough. One warning: There are seemingly dozens of little anti-moisture packs in this and we didn't realize they were falling all over the house. Beware ... they are dangerous for pets and kids!
3,Make sure of the size you need,"The review is not for the bag , however for the purchasing experience so others will be made aware.. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong size - the 30X50 size was too big for my needs - so I returned the bag following the Amazon instructions. I ended up with paying half of the purchase price in re-stocking fees.Item: 3497 OLIVE DRAB TOP LOAD CANVAS DUFFLE BAG 30 X 50Quantity: 1ASIN: B00029R84UReason for refund: Customer returnHere's the breakdown of your refund for this item:Item Refund: $29.89Restocking Fee Refund Deduction: ($14.95)"
2,Not as substantial as I had hoped,"I bought this to use as an overbag when flying with my frame pack on backpacking trips, so that all of the various straps and buckles, etc. aren't hanging out there to get caught in the luggage equipment. The bag is plenty big to hold my pack, but the material isn't nearly as heavy as the smaller Army-surplus bags I already own, and the clip that holds the top closed is a joke. It bent and popped open the first time I yanked on it. That's it: I can't trust it on a plane. The bag will still be useful, I suppose, and it's not very expensive... but don't count on it to be heavy-duty."
4,Strong and big bag! but no rope or anything to close it on the package!,"Great bag really strong! have a lot of capacity to put anything you want, i order the medium size and its perfect! only problem was on delivery service and nothing to wrap the bag."
2,could be better,"I got what I paid for. Wish it had shoulder straps, like a backpack. I bought the biggest size you could get."
2,Wasn't what I thought it was,"My family had recently heard a song on Sirius called Chakra Meditation from Shalila Sharamon. The music was absolutely beautiful. It took some time to find the album and I was disappointed that it wasn't an mp3 download. However, I decided to purchase the CD even though it was over $17, which is absolutely ridiculous to begin with. However, we really wanted the music. When I got the CD the case was smashed and damaged, but the CD was in good condition. The entire CD is people talking throughout, which was not what I wanted. I simply wanted the music. This purchase was a complete waste of money. I would never purchase another CD online again."
1,"Mama, don't let your babies grow up to watch Veggie Tales","I'm amazed that anyone would subject their kids, or themselves, to this kind of formulaic junk. It's far from engaging, nor does it retain a hint of originality, but what it lacks in those departments it makes up for in blandness and sheer moral propaganda. Do we really want our kids' entertainment (cause there's nothing educational about this) totally devoid of the anarchy and free spirit that is at the center of the childhood experience? It's sad that most media made for kids is this watered down. In the forties we had Pippi Longstocking, now we have Veggie Tales... How low we have sunk."
2,"The theme song is MISSING, does not allow menu","My 4.5 year-old son's ultimate favorite VeggieTales song is ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything."" I bought this DVD, so he could watch the music video for it any time he wanted. We were very surprised and disappointed to find that this DVD does not have the main song! I really don't understand it... I noticed they play an instrumental version sporadically throughout the movie, but never once do they sing the actual song as seen on the ""Silly Songs"" DVD. Also, it did not allow us to go to the DVD menu at any point during the movie. Very annoying.That said, I adore VeggieTales, and this movie is really cute. They just need to include the title song and fix the technical issue with the menu."
3,Somewhat painful,"We have been Veggie Tales fans since our kids were little... we always love the ""humor"" that even adults could enjoy.This one was so different... it lacked the humorous flavor and clear message we were so accustomed to with ""Veggie Tales""... Didnt seem ""authentic"" Veggie Tales! Didnt really have too much of a point, like usual.I gave it three stars... which means ""It was OK"".. I guess little kids would love anything with Bob and Larry...For those of us who have enjoyed Veggie Tales for alot of years.. who have supported them, bought their movies for the great values and biblical message and awesome humor...you will probably see that something is lacking with this one.Big Idea.... dont ruin a good thing... Dont fix it if it isnt broken!! You dont need ""Universal"" to be bigger or to be great.... you were great already!Sorry :("
3,Movie is Great - I don't like the included Previews,"The DVD was one seeming burned for rental from a Video location, not like one purchased from Big Idea. The video previews, in my mind, are not kid friendly."
1,"Under new ownership---Now secular, in my opinion","I will not get any more VeggieTale DVDs that are created under the new management. I was so dissappointed with this DVD, it didn't have the Christian feel to it at all. I'm glad I borrowed this one from the library."
3,"Okay not the best VeggieTale Movie, and They did sing the song","This movie was okay, not the best, but what really disapointed me is that they didn't even sing the ""Pirates that Don't do anything"" Song, How can they make a movie based off the song and not have then sing the song?"
5,Great movie!,"We bought this DVD for our 2 year old daughter (and maybe ourselves too) and she loves it. The whole family enjoys Veggie Tales with their great messages, witty humor, and cute songs."
5,Sutle Theme,"I think it might have taken me 2 times watching this to get the idea of what they were trying to teach with this, but the ""what it takes to be a hero"" part was obvious enough for kids to get. And it showed a princess doing what was right, even when it was hard or dangerous, as well as male veggies learning that they had what it takes ('Wild at Heart' reference.) But when I saw the King (parallel to God) burst in to the rescue with light right when all seamed lost made me tear up. A good good vs evil story."
5,Veggies Everyone Loves!,"We took our kids to see this in the theater and they were glued to the screen. We are very anxious for the dvd!! The ""Rock Monster"" video is delightful."
3,Minimal depth in the content,"Somewhat entertaining with a few funny parts, but a bit of a let down for a Veggie Tales movie, as far as content goes. The ending had a little content, but overall kind of lacking in depth."
5,Very cute and funny.,"Just like all the other Veggie Tales movies, this one didn't disappoint. It was cute, funny and had a good spiritual message."
4,Works wonderful!,Great antenna. Hooked up to my mirror bracket on the truck with ease. Best reception I ever had. My only concern is I hope the plastic housing holds up through the winter and washings.
4,Great Buy,"I really like these shoes. They fit fairly true to size, maybe slightly large. Wonderful buy for less than $25."
5,Very nice work!,"This is truly a nice piece of work for the Magickian that loves to craft his/her own tools. Ever think that the Magickian only has one wand? Think again! Within this book, you find several color plates of magickal tools ranging from the Enochian Watchtower tablets to the Elemental weapons and grade wands. These are really nice, too. This works with the complement to the book, The Magickian's Art, which goes into rituals dealing with consecrations and other uses. The complement is not necessary, but is still wonderful. If you ever wanted to make some of the tools, be an Golden Dawn initiate or not, then this is the book!"
5,Get it - not for beginners,The Ciceros again ! The act of constructing a wand or other ritual objects IS an act of magick; the magician spends time and energies creating ritual objects. The act of creation is a process of growth in his/her own magickal abilities and spiritual development.
2,Pablum for the Magickal Masses,"This is typical Llewllyn pablum.Having read through the book, I quickly realized why the sense of deja vu - I'd read this all before, in other books, where the publisher was not trying to set his own agenda of what is -and what isn't - acceptable use of magick.Cicero does indeed have a good writing style, and attempts to be as clear as possible as to the consecration and uses of ritual tools. What is most noteworthy, however, is not what was written, but what was missing.I can't help but wonder whether the results are simply the product of the author, or the product of the whitelight fluffbunnies at Llewellyn."
3,There's a strategy to fit your teaching style!,"Good-bye Round Robin contains 25 oral reading strategies that stay away from traditional round-robin reading. Included in each strategy description are sections where teachers explain how they use/manage that strategy, extentions on the strategy are provided, and book/poem titles are suggested. Many chapters include easy reference check lists that tell which strategies can be used to assess which skills, as well as record keeping check lists created specifically for that strategy....a real time saver. Having over 17 years teaching experience, it was reassuring to know that I stumbled upon some of the explained strategies in my career (and they're good). The book also gave me new strategies (and variations on old ones) that I can use in my middle school classroom. I recommend this book to starting teachers who are looking to add to their ""tool belt"" of skills, and to veteran teachers who are seeking effective, meaningful oral reading strategies."
3,"Good-bye Round Robin, updated edition: 25 Effective Oral Reading STrategies",This book reads just like the last edition of good-bye Round Robin. I wanted something more. I had to keep checking to see that I wasn't reading my old book.
1,I threw this away today.,"Don't buy this. I did and regretted it, having now found a better solution with the suction""SUP"" grip. There are better products."
5,Charming and Imaginative,This book was my favorite as a child. It is a charming story with beautiful watercolor pictures. I bought this book for my daughter (Maggie) and she loves it just as much as I do. Fantastic book that should be a part of every child's collection.
5,Absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!!!,"This is one of the most gorgeaus illustrations we have come accross. The story is imaginative and very visual, the illustrations go perfectly and really make you feel like you have just taken a ride on the Maggie B.I recommend this one!"
4,I recommend it!,"I bought this book ""in the dark"" because I have a neice named Maggie, and I thought she'd like a book named after her. The book arrived last night, and I am delighted with it. The story and art have a lovely, old-world fairy tale feel -- it made me think of Peter Pan. It's not a loud, bright, techy sort of book -- so if that's a criteria, this is not the book for you. But if you want charming, imaginative and comforting, this is a wise choice."
5,absolutely enchanting!!!!!,"It has been at least 20 years since I read this book...And in my memory has remained my most favorite childhood book. I must have read it over one hundred times...it truly captivated me... I dreamed of being Maggie and having her responsibilities- they seemed so adult yet so much fun! My one and only disappointment with this book is that in the paperback I have, every other page is in black and white. And Irene Haas' beautiful water colors are the main reason I returned to The Maggie B. over and over again. I'm wondering if the hardcover is different or newer copies are different...I'm expecting my first child, and if it's a girl I will definately be reading this to her!!!"
5,The Maggie B created my fantasy.,"Lately I've been dreaming of getting away, finding magic, drinking tea and playing house - outside of my daily responsibilities. I realized that this fantasy was first instilled in me by the Maggie B. I've never seen it on my nieces' shelves and I wondered if it was even in print. Clicking onto Amazon and seeing the color illustration of the cover brought the whole book back to me, especially of Maggie, cooking for James aboard their floating home. And that is where I long to be. That is my fantasy."
1,Very disappointing.,"This book is only useful if you want information, that is readily available online for free, compiled in one location."
4,Map Fix,"My sister-in-law is very interested in Scotland and her connection. She saw a copy of this map at a highland game and wanted it. I will make it a nice surprise Christmas present. A very nice map, filling all my needs."
1,Unsafe! Zero stars!,"My niece received this item for her 3rd birthday and in the space of 24 hours she'd fallen twice while wearing the shoes. I mean nasty falls - hard! - with her limbs all twisted together. She tripped while trying to run in them, and later she slipped on the kitchen floor (No traction). My brother-in-law tossed them in the trash as soon as she was down for a nap.Please, please reconsider if you're tempted to buy this. It should be recalled."
4,A must for a Princess!!,"Pros: Very cute, helps child learn colors. The buttons allow you to light up the wand in red, yellow, and blue, then you can mix blue and red to make purple, etc. The shoes mimic the color of the wand. My daughter loves both the wand and shoes, and the shoes are not difficult for her to walk in.Cons: The shoes each take a couple AAA batteries, and unlike the wand they don't automatically shut off, each shoe has an on/off switch on the bottom. Would prefer shoes to just turn off after a few minutes of non-use.Ultimately a wonderful toy for your princess"
5,Awesome toy!,"My daugher LOVES these, she got them for her 2nd birthday. We have hardwood floors and she runs and clops around in them just fine. You do have to turn them off and on but she can do that too. My husband and I are still amazed by how many different colors the wand makes (not just your basic red, yellow and blue...it does green and princess orange). And then the shoes just flash and change color too. They are really neat. Highly recommend!"
3,"Bag Was As Expected, Not The Size","Typical US Military issue canvas bag. The dimensions, however, were VERY misleading. The opening dimension was taken with the bag flat. If you open the bag, the dimension is actually much smaller. I didn't fit the item I wanted to bag and it isn't worth returning. I will find use for it elsewhere."
1,CHEAP INDIAN MADE JUNK,"If you are looking for a GI style duffel bag that will actually see and survive hard use, look elsewhere. This thing is garbage. While the cotton material is acceptable, the all-important stitching is weak and done with poor cotton thread. Buy USA and get NYLON."
2,too expensive,bag would be great in a bigger house. it was too big for ours. too expensive for construction and limited colors available and doesn't allow to prop up like a chair. spent $30 to return it and it was not an easy process so this was a total rip off and shipping was ridiculous.
5,Awesome!!!,"Yeah, this Boon Animal Bag is so much better than I thought it would be. It is sooooo soft, and the zippers are very high quality. I was envisioning those zippers that come undone, or get stuck, or whatever. I couldn't be happier with this product. Still looks brand new after lots of loading and unloading, zipping and unzipping."
4,expensive but worth it so far,"This is great for storing all those stuffed animals my daughter receives. I try to get rid of them but she still plays with most of them. SHe also wanted a bean bag chair. Boon took care of all my problems. SHe can keep her animals and easily pull them out to play with them. She has a seat to watch TV on.Mom is happy because the critters are no longer taking over the house. So far the quality seems great, we've had it a few months and the netting is holding up well (main concern), and I like that the fur doesn't seem to shed (I have tile,so I don't know how this does on carpet). Does hold alot of stuffed toys and they do settle after awhile, making room for more.It would be nice if they were cheaper. I would like to give them out as gifts, but this one was a stretch for me. As I said the quality seems really great so far, so I guess that justifies the price."
2,wonderful idea. if only it wouldn't have ripped in 3 places already,"I think this is a great idea. but when I filled it with my kids animals, it became very heavy. to the point where the kids (ages 3 and 6) can't move it around on their own.I did not over-fill it. there is plenty of room for more animals in there.not only can't THEY move it, but it is hard for me to move. and at one point I ripped one of the mesh windows while moving it. recently I notice that two of the other windows are ripped.I guess I would recommend this if you plan to leave it in one spot all the time. but that wasn't how we wanted to use it, so for us it didn't work out.the $80 price tag is too high in any case (whether it works or not).the material is nice and it is a great idea. but that isn't cutting it for us. wish I hadn't blown that big chunk of cash."
4,"good quality, pricey","my daughter (teen) is happy, fits a lot of stuffed animals.I think its a little pricey"
3,Hard to see diagrams,"A beautiful book but very hard to see the black notations for folds when he uses the dark brown color for his paper in the diagrams. I think Robert Lang also loves to use sink folds, maybe too much!"
4,Awesome and fun,Well worth the price. Told my children that this is where their stuffed animals would rest and be happy. It has become a great place for them to lounge with their friends.
3,Fun storage bag but a but too big,"Fun, cute storage bag for stuffed animals. Personally, i think it's a bit too big and wish we got the smaller sized one. Overall, i'm happy with the purchase, but misjudged its size for our daughter's room."
4,kids love it,This thing is huge holds alot of toys. It is thick material and thick screen (for the see-thru portion). It is sewn together well and out-lasts two boys (3 and 7). I'm sure it will hold up for years to come. My only problem with it is that it is hard to find a place for it. I set it in a corner like a chair and they use it when playing the Wii.
1,How Amazon Ripped Me Off!!!!,"This is such BS to be selling this silly document for 4 $. I read encyclopedia in the title and get to thinking that it is an extensive book with lots of information. And instead what do I get for my hard earned $4.00. A single page of text I could have written myself. Please, don't waste your money on this document which is a single page of text. Absolute waste of time and money. I must expres my discontent!!! I can't believe they lowered themselves to such an extent!"
2,Pricey for the product,"I thought this would be a novel sign to hang on my fence since we do have a large English Mastiff. The sign is plastic and has stickers on it (not paint) we did, however hang it. It has only one hole at the top to screw the sign up and should have one on the bottom also, because after hanging the wind came up and caught the bottom of the sign which broke it at the top screw and ripped it off the fence. So the sign didn't last very long. Indecently the dog figure, on the sign, looks more like a pit bull than a English Mastiff."
1,WHAT ARE THE DIMENSIONS???,"I like the looks of the pan and would order it, if I knew it was the size I was looking for. It would be so much easier to shop for things on line if you gave more information under the photo of the item. I do love that you can view the item close up. Just give the dimensions under the photo of the pans and I will be a happy shopper."
5,The Truth about Love,"All I can say is that when I read this book, I felt as though I was reading about myself. It is comforting to know that not only being a woman, but also a believer in Christ, that I could have a soul mate that I have never met. Thank You, Sharon Ries and may the Lord Bless You."
5,And the Word Was...Engaging,"Neil Downs' escape from and search for answers brilliantly emblematizes the human condition. His character moves through layers of paradox: beauty and bitterness, nurture and apathy, spirituality and emptiness. It's storytelling at its finest. There's something in this novel for everyone: philosophy, history, love, loss, politics, art, sensuality; even a hint of baseball for those of us who still revere the sport. A sad and sophisticated meditation with moments of hope, ""where the least articulate mumbler to the most able versifier is in possession of the same interminable ache."" It's a smart, smart book."
3,OK but is lacking in areas,This is a good starter book if you are taking your 70-290 exam but it is not enough. I took the exam and there were questions that I needed more detail on than what was mentioned in this book. One of the practice tests is worthless but the other is of pretty good quality (near self test level). Hope this helps.
5,want that yellow rice?,"This is what you have been looking for unless you grind your own annato seeds! If you're wanting that yellow rice you've had in Miami, Puerto Rico, Brasil, Cuba or a thousand other Latino restaurants, then look no further. I've been using this product for 30 yrs. and it is the same thing, same quality, same mistake free results. All you need now is that unreal rice, onion, garlic, oregano, pepper, salt recipe I've been using passed down from my dear old Brasilian father....hehe....good luck. If you want a copy, send a sase to Chef Doogie 3700 nantucket pkwy, oxnard, ca. 93035"
5,Great Product!,Very fast shippingProduct is exactly what I expectedI will definately shop here againThank you so much!
4,Fun Learning Time,These are a great value. They are educational and a good size. They are durable. We've gotten great use of them. They were played with in the tub almost every day and never mildewed or got yucky. I finally threw mine away after over a year because they had bite marks in them and we are moving but they were worth the money and my kids are asking for them so I will be replacing them.
3,Fun to use,"The bathtub letters and numbers were an instant hit with my grandchildren - ages 2 and 4. Fortunately, the walls surrounding the tub are smooth so they had no problem adhering. However, we were quickly dismayed to realize that we could not spell my granddaughter's name because she has a double letter ""bb"" in it. The kit only has one of every letter and number - a fact I failed to realize when purchasing it. Buying two sets would have made spelling names and more words possible. All in all it was a good purchase. The kids loved it."
4,Very cute and they actually stick,"We bought these when baby was very young. I stuck them somewhere and forgot about them. When she became older, we played with them outside of the tub until (duh!) I remembered they were bath toys. So, into the bath toy bucket they go. They stick on the tub, which really entertains our little one. One night, after bath time, I was being particularly lazy and didn't clean the tub or put away the toys. When I went into the bathroom in the morning, the letters were still stuck to the side of the tub. So yah! They do what they are supposed to do."
5,Vortex Binoculars,I received the binoculars on time and in perfect condition and I am very pleased with both price and performance.
4,Worth the money for a beginner,"This is worth the money if you don't have someone to teach you. I had been wakeboarding for a couple of years (nothing fancy), but this helped me to learn a few tips and tricks. It would even be helpful for someone who has never wakeboarded before."
1,Whose Death in the Tunnel?,"I thought the book was sick and horrifying. The only--debateable--merit it had was proving how easy it would have been to arrange her death, while making it look like a case of drunk driving."
5,"Excellent read, Highly recomend!","This book was very hard to put down .It gives you a totally different look at what might of happened.The author takes the facts and creates a story that ended in tradgedy.As he twists and turns you begin to wonder if Diana would have gone to these extremes to protect her privacy. While I quite beleive she is no longer with us,I must say that this book was different from all I've read and a pleasure to view another viewpoint.A must read for those Diana fans who seem to keep re-reading her life story with different words and diferent authors. Thank you Mr. Becker"
1,Waste of Money!,"This is my second review of this book. The first was deleted from this section; this is fuel for my ""conspiracy theory"" that all the laudatory reviews posted here are from friends, relatives, interested publishers or agents of the author. This book is very poorly written, boring, titillating in the cover blurbs which never are met by the content of the book. The writing is stilted and sophmoric. (Entire paragraphs read like: ""Adam stood up. Adam looked at his pate foie gras. Adam walked to the window. Adam glanced out the window . . . "" you get the idea.)Anyone who buys this story because of a deep attraction to the subject matter is warned to stay away."
2,full of implausibilities,"Too many implausibilities. Diana, never Di, didn't have enough money to disappear yet leave her sons 35 million or so. She wouldn't leave without telling someone she was going.One reviewer calls her an accessory to murder, she didn't know of them (they were also unlikely)Generally written at a 9th grade level LEAVE IT ALONE!"
2,"Mystery Thriller, but not much information about Diana","This book started out with some horrible writing, but after getting thru the first couple of poorly written chapters, I was hooked on the premise and the plot, and stayed up late finishing the book. Ex-CIA agent and his almost identical sister run an international operation to help people disappear and start a new life with a new identity, with the story about the latest client, Princess Diana, in a scheme which parallels the final public days of the real Princess Diana. Unfortunately, although the book was interesting to read, the story did not tell very much about Diana as a person."
1,Is this for real?,"No, I'm not talking about the book, I'm talking about the reviews. This book was so much trash, I returned it about half way through it. It's funny, like another reviewer, I left a bad review of ""Hannibal"" on-line, and received a similar recommendation to read this book. (The nexus escapes me, the two books aren't even the same genre). Poor plot, poor execution (maybe the author should be executed), poor writing. There's a reason your local bookstore isn't carrying this title. I'm just lucky Border's has a liberal return policy."
5,"Becker confirms that Di had a ""photo double""","This fascinating story suggests that it was Princess Diana's ""photo double"" not Di herself who died in the tragic accident two years ago. The plot is plausible and realistic. Becker presents Diana as a survivor. How refreshing to see her in this light for once. Di hires a professional who orchestrates a complicated scheme that provides her with a new identity. I read once several years ago of Di's interest in golf, and Becker's descriptions of Di on the golf course are priceless. The story kept me on the edge of my chair. It was refreshing and intriguing, an absolute must read!"
2,"Exciting adventure/some good points, but many flaws.","Here's the thing: I read this in about two days, so it obviously held my interest. The premise is fascinating. But the writing, badly in need of a good editor, often made me cringe. There were several loose ends and conclusions that didn't add up, besides the many spelling and grammatical errors. And who needs that horrible opening sequence about ""Poor Di"" who lived such a wretched existence, yadda yadda yadda. If you want a book that isn't so disgustingly slanted in favor of her being a saint rather than a real person (and no true ""Di Fan"" does), read ""The Real Diana"" -- but you won't. That one made me believe in her as a person, and it also made me admire her in the end for overcoming her problems when all I had seen was her whining and her rude exposure of the family secrets because she couldn't have everything her way. Implying (in ""Whose Death"") that the queen was Satan was a bit more than I could take."
2,Broken (hearted),"Love the look, but the weight of the base relative to the thickness of the wall seems to be the problem. These break regularly. I even find them busted when opening the dishwasher after an uneventful cycle. Do look good with a Mojito though!"
3,They are growing......tall.....strong,its sad when your little boys grow up. just listen.....theres a pubic hair.....wait...no more sqeaky voice. cherish these times for they dont exist. love mama.
2,Get the unabridged version,"The only reason this book gets a 2 is because is does have some nice electron micrographs. But my praise for the book stops there. ""Concise"" doesn't begin to describe how concise this book actually is. Its depth of topic exploration does not delve any further than ""This is a kidney"" or ""This is a heart."" Which I already knew of course. Yes, I'm being slightly sarcastic, but you get the point. This was required for our first year medical class (why?), and yet our professors' lectures always exceeded the information contained in this book. I'm a second year now, and when I wish to brush up on my histology in order to help me understand pathology, I have no reference book! Do yourself a favor and buy the unabridged version if you can find it (it's out of print now). Surprisingly, this version is EXCELLENT and is considered to be the THE authoritative histology text. Don't waste your money..."
2,Not what I thought!,I thought this was a full size cutting board not just a smal cheese board size so i was disappointed when i received it. it is too small to cut on so i just have it leaning against the wall to look at. I should have checked the measurements before i bought it
5,This stuff WORKS !!,"It may take a while for the insects to find the spots where you put it, but once they do find it & take it back to the next,they are soon to be GONE.You can have all the exterminators spray what they use all over the house,but I really don't think it could possibly work as good as this combat bait.We had a serious problem going on in our APT. I'll admit,it may have taken a month or so to see results,but the end result is,they are GONE!You bet I'll recommend this bait to everybody."
1,I didn't get what offered,"The ad clearly said: Combat Roach Killer Gel 12/30 Gm.. I was expecting 12 cases and I recieved just one. When i filed a claim they just said that ""somebody else changed the descripcion"" a offered me a 10% discount (less than $1). The funny thing is that i already paid $15 to get it in my country"
2,Who is Lothar Bellag?,"This item is misidentified. Lothar is some author and has no connection with this tape. I bought this used through Amazon.com and it is a recording of a live broadcast from Dresden in 1992. The performance includes only three of the six cantatas that make up the Christmas Oratorio. The performance is lackluster and the video is fuzzy, having been converted to NTSC from the European PAL video system. The audio has a strange tapping noise heard between numbers. The harpsichord gets increasingly out of tune as the performance goes on. Someone bought this video when a public library dumped it and has foisted it off onto unsuspecting Internet buyers. The best performance on video is conducted by Beringer and includes all six cantatas and no strange noises."
2,Fun but not durable,"My 18-month-old daughter has loved Dora for quite some time. We bought her the set and she loved it - we encourage her to eat to find Dora and Boots under the food. However, even though we hand washed it 80% of the time, the plate suddenly became pitted and was ruined within 2-3 MONTHS after purchase. I was very disappointed with the quality. We still have the plate sets from when we were kids and they are still in excellent condition after being used for years with multiple kids. 2-3 months is atrocious for durability, no matter how cute it is."
2,"Very misleading to say ""Manual""! There is no manual!",There is no manual included with this upgrade. There is a folded sheet with New Product Activation info. It is getting harder and harder to get a real manual with software. A pdf file is NOT a real manual. Software gets more expensive yet we no longer get a hard copy manual. It would be nice if software companies at least offered a hard copy manual at an additional price.
4,Did not read entire description,"I too thought that this would be a bigger product. Thankfully it was not my son's main christmas present because I too would have been running out last minute to buy more stuff, and shipping back would totally erase the value of returning it. Oh, well- from now on read the entire description!"
3,Eh...,"I thought this was going to be a larger sized truck, but it's more the size of a matchbox car. I bought this as a Christmas present for my cousin, but had to buy additional gifts to go with it because of it's size."
1,Should be called HEADGAMES 101,"What is this? Suddenly it's no longer a good thing to be an independent woman and make any moves? Suddenly it's hand all the visible power to the men to soothe their egos and pull strings and manipulate them behind their backs? I'm a gay man and I find this whole book offensive. I spent a fun filled night with a single female friend who has more class than these ""dream girls"" can ever hope to have and we destroyed this book from cover to cover. Men beware! There is a new breed of women out there who are being encouraged to play games, which include playing you off against 2 other men at a time in a ""dating cycle"". If a man was found to be doing this he would be up for castration. Oh but it's okay for women to do this, says the author, her justification being that the men will pay for all the dates and leave the women with all sorts of money for lovely clothes, shoes, and makeovers. Well yippppeeee.And they said Britney Spears was disempowering for ""the cause""."
3,An okay read.....,"This book was an okay read, it has some pretty decent advice mixed with quite a bit of stuff i'd take with a great big grain of salt. If you're in the market for this type of relationship book I would recommend that you buy ""He's Just Not That Into You"" or ""Why Men Love Bitches"" instead. Both are good reads full of excellent advice."
1,Very basic - nothing new here.,"Thought this would be a good book after reading the reviews. However after reading the book, which took about 5 minutes, I hadn't gained any useful information. Didn't think is was as humourous as other reviewers. Save your money."
5,IMPRESSIVE!,I also highly recommend -How to be a Super Hot Woman: 339 Tips to Make Every Man Fall in Love with You and Every Woman Envy Youby Mandy Simons
1,To Learn about true love read JPII's Theology of the Body...,"For information on true love, which is the donation of self to another please check out either John Paul II's ""Theology of the Body"" or ""Love and Responsibility"" or Christopher West's shorter versions ""Theology of the Body for Beginners""Thanks and God bless and you all are in my prayers,"
1,More Disempowering Games,"The book has too many outdated ""tricks"" to ""make a man fall madly in love with you"" that simply do NOT WORK. While reading, I thought how DISEMPOWERING this book is! Are we as women just supposed to play the old games? Look at the divorce rate. Trying to make a man marry you is NOT the answer! What about AFTER the marriage vows? What about a real relationship?The book brings nothing to really help women and men. It takes two for a relationship to work, not just one person playing games."
1,Stupid,"This book doesn't add any new information or even any new thoughts. It is very similar to The Rules. Some of the concepts are OK, but the tone felt condescending. It took maybe an hour to read, and afterwards I actually threw it in the trash. I would be too embarrassed to take this to a second hand store; not because of the title, but because of the lame content. If you're into this approach, just read The Rules instead."
4,some good advice,"I think this book has some good points, but mostly it tell you what you know but didn't realize was honestly true and not just something you assumed. Check it out. It's a nice read."
5,Learn what your friends don't have the nerve to tell you...,"I read this book to see if there really was substance past the insulting title. There IS. This is a quick read, but very to the point and very motivational. Any woman - married, or just starting to enter the dating arena, can benefit from this book. It should have an addendum of ""and how to keep your man interested."" Simple, straitforward advice that will help you improve your attitude on dating. Other chick books like ""Between Boyfriends"" are entertaining, but if you want to get some good ideas, this book is for you."
2,Sort of amusing,"This book is basically a more politically correct (but not by a lot) version of the rules. It is a quick read and sort of amusing, but filled with the same advice."
4,She's Right,"I know it seems hard to believe, but she's right. Don't call him. Don't talk about marriage. And don't date him exclusively. The guy I want to marry kept putting me off until I started following her advice. Now he's all over me. It may sound stupid, but she's right."
2,stuff you already knew,"This is a tiny little book of stuff you already knew, however maybe it hits home when you see it in print. It does not deal with the dreaded internet date which presents a whole different set of issues, so maybe the author should think about updating."
1,Start getting dumped,"This book is not what it says it is, and is a waste of time for any intelligent girl, or any one at all really. It basically tells you how to be dishonest and shallow and that is how to get what you want. Not much different from most any other book in this genre, so I would stick with a Vogue style relationship quiz and probably get more out of it than you would out of this book. Or honestly just be yourself and you'll have more luck than any advice you could get here."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This short book wouldn't help anyone. With large type and short chapters, this book wouldn't help anyone who watches one episode of Oprah. Nothing in here you haven't seen, read or heard before. Don't waste your money."
2,Haven't I seen this before?,"Like 'The Rules', half of this book is common sense, and half is sexist claptrap. It's the 21st century. The idea that women need lives of their own is no longer revolutionary. If you need to be told this, you don't have a man problem, you have a major self-esteem problem.As for the rest, it's basic game playing. I'm sure it works, but what kind of prize do you win? I don't know a single decent guy who would repeatedly call a woman who didn't return his overtures. There's a difference between gallantry and stalking.That being said, the book is cute, so it deserves a star for the message's presentation."
2,"""The Rules"" Lite","Disappointing book. I agree with the previous reviewer who said the good thing about this book is it is short and easy to read.If you have already read ""The Rules"" you don't need this book. While it makes some good if rehashed points, it is overly simplified. According to the author, if you never call a man, date 3 men at one time, and pamper yourself, you will soon be married to a wealthy, handsome romantic man who treats you like a princess and calls you daily while you still aren't calling him. Good Grief! Save your money."
2,Why not 1-8,"Why would they do seasons 1-7 and not the Complete Series? This is a little odd. The packaging could use some work, as well."
2,Be careful...,"While watching the first 17 dvd's I noticed there were a few episodes that were missing pieces, part of the story. Like they left out a section between commercial breaks. Then on disc 18 the final episode with Prue...her death scene is missing. A pretty pivitol part not to be included. Currently working with vendor to determine what happened. Good luck..be careful if you are a true charmed fan!"
2,"Great Series, poor Product","I bought these and had problems with probably 8 discs. One was completely unviewable. It would just start to play, lock up on a scene and I could never get it to move on.I love the series, but the overall quality of the maker of this set was poor.I also noticed that some discs had disclosures in Japanese or Chinese, some english. Overall, felt like a mish mash of leftovers tossed together and not in correct order."
1,Not worth the savings,"If you're anything like me, you were tempted by the fact that you save $100, give or take. However, it is absolutely not worth it. The quality control on these sets ranges from abysmal to non-existent, and you don't even get Season 8. Of my entire series, only 7 discs played properly. Most of the set was unplayable due to skips; by the middle of the episodes the DVD had frozen entirely or was jolting ahead. Season 3 didn't have episodes loaded onto the discs for the entire season, and half of Season 5 couldn't even be read by my DVD player. And that's not even counting all of the problems with the subtitles, no chapter selection, and no extras.This set is no frills added, and unfortunately the ""frills"" include quality control. It's worth paying the extra money if you really want the entire series, or looking around to find the series at a lower price. Plus, you won't have the hassle of trying to get a refund for your shoddy purchase."
2,They do not stack securely,"I bought these thinking it would decrease counter space by allowing me to cool lots of cookies on these stacking racks. Unfortunately, when stacked they are so unstable, there was no way I would trust my baked goods on them for fear of the whole system crashing to the floor.I used them as single layer racks and because I have ample counter space in my kitchen that worked okay, but I am disappointed that they didn't do what they said they would."
5,Good purchase for any consumer of homemade cookies,As the consumer of cookies this is a great tool to give as a gift to the baker in your life.
3,Product OK,"Product does the job, but legs are flimsy. I have Pampered Chef ones that are much more sturdy. Will not buy again"
5,Cooling Rack - Space saver,"Baking 1,000's of holiday cookies, the racks were very useful for my limited space. They were never off my dining room table. A great purchase!"
1,extremely poor quality and service,"These earrings are very poorly made. The wires fell out of both earrings after only a few wearings. They are now useless. I contacted the company twice but received no reply. The ""5-star"" review was obviously written by a company employee. The earrings don't last long enough to make a ""crusty hole,"" despite the ""ingenious single piece design."""
3,Expensive!,"I got these for my husband last year. He wanted a titanium earring and this fit the mark. It's not particularly noteworthy and extremely expensive, but he seems happy with it."
4,shower curtain,Nice item. the problem is it looks pink in the picture. It is very brown and peach. A disapointment in the color.
1,Dance Requiem,"Too fast, too jumpy, more of a dance suite than a Death Mass. I have sang Mozart's Requiem with Berenbaum and I have heard it conducted by other top conductors. This is the worst. Jordi Savall seems to think that a requiem is a dance suite. The orchestra starts in a jumpy spirit, too fast, too jumpy, then the trumpets come in so loud that the rest of the orchestra becomes a far away echo and so goes the rest of the CD. Too fast, jumpy and not balanced.Do not buy this CD. Mozart Requiem is too good to be listen to an amateur interpretation of it. Do not buy this CD if you love Mozart's Requiem."
3,Alright...,"It's a decent book; I'm presently taking a class being taught using it, and it has been usedful for learning things like AC. However, we just hit transistors - and it falls flat on its face. It just doesn't do enough to make it make sense, I've read through it repeatedly and it just won't click; other then that, it's been a good book so far, but like others have said, it needs a second edition with quite a few things cleaned up."
2,What a headache!!,"The mathematical theory is awful, unless you've had a full year of calculus. I have, and I still am confused at the easiest equations. There so many holes missing. For example, let's say A<B, and C<B, but we don't know about A's relationship with C. This is similar to the problems in this book. It's horribly written. DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD COLLEGE LEVEL CALCULUS!!!"
3,Not for new learners!! New learners stay away!,"Despite the books promise in the ""what makes this book unique"" Preface, It never gave me the big picture and just blasted me with more formulas and High level math. Where is the ""big picture it promised"". For Inventors?? The book itself is probably a great book just marketed wrong."
4,Great book for hobbyists who want a bit of theory,The diagrams and explanations in this book are great for hobbyists who want to understand the electronics a bit more without going into too much theory. It's a good balance between real world applications and in depth theory.
3,"It's good theory, but that's all.","I've always been atracted to playing around with electronics and I thought this book might be just the thing to get me doing cool things with electronics. I hoped this book would inspire me by showing me ""real world"" examples. But it seemed that the examples were half done. Sure there's a diagram of a high-pass filter, or how op-amps work, but what the heck does all that mean? Where are those examples that will help me invent? I never got the full picture and felt like I was just reading a cliff notes version of a real text book.It just seemed like I was promised building blocks and instructions and all I got was the instructions to build building blocks. I'll give it a three becuase it does have all the theory in there, but don't get this book looking for a mix of theory and cool circuits... it's all theory."
3,Nice but larger diameter seat would be appreciated,"Stools are nice height, nice looking, sturdy and wearing well. They are the ""go to"" seat at my table. Purchased 2 of these stools to go with matching Pub set which has 2 stools with backs in set. These will not slide under the Pub table I purchased as I had hoped but nice having 2 without backs. Seat base is not as wide as some would like but works. Skinny folks like but average person would appreciate larger seat."
5,Nice quality for the price.,Very nice quality for the price of this stool. Easy assembly. You will not find a stool as attractive as this for the price. Very happy with the product.
4,Bruce Jones is still incredible,"After the cataclysmic events of the Split Decisions storyarc, Dead Like Me finds Bruce Banner, Nadia Blonsky, Doc Samson, and Mr. Blue, revealed to be Betty Ross, all at a cross roads. The conspiracy is deeper than any of them imagined, and now they have a Banner clone to deal with who is more than he seems. Even though this four part storyarc is fairly uneventful compared to other volumes in Jones' Hulk run, he still manages to keep the suspense mounting, even when he leaves more questions than answers. Doug Braithwaite's art is rather similar to that of the fantastic Mike Deodato, but not as cinematic. All in all, this collection continues Bruce Jones' amazing run on the Hulk, and is worth picking up for those who have enjoyed his work."
5,This was the most informative and interesting read.,This book filled me in on some of the aspects of forensic science that I was unaware of. It was just the information I was looking for. I am now considering going into the Forensic Science field. I am just trying to find out what I need to do next.
5,Nostalgia,My dad has this record and we used to listen to it all the time growing up. I gave it to him on CD for Christmas. Now he can listen to it on his Bose or in the car on long trips.
5,Still funny after all these years,some things never change and Bill Cosby's un-offensive humor is a God send in today's seemingly mandatory foul mouthedcomedy.
4,"""Do NOT touch certain parts of your body... on TV""","Another example of clean humor. With the exception of the Lone Ranger (due to the word ""Hell"" and the reference to getting drunk) this recording is more proof that clean stand-up comedy is suitable for all ages. The skit about Football at the end will have all teenage sports players in stitches!Bravo Bill!"
5,This is Bill Cosby doing what he does best,"This, Cosby's second album, deals with his childhood and the fun he had. Listen to him recall playing street football, owning a pet rhinocerous, going through his drunken father's pants for change...There are also more contemporary situations: He talks about being a medic in the Navy, playing football on TV, and he discusses on the sickness of witnessing dead people in open caskets. For pure sillyness, he does a clever spoof of ""The Lone Ranger""."
3,"Cosby, ""Starting Out""","On this album, Bill Cosby was just beginning to perfect his storytelling standup comedian style. The stories here are shorter than the ones he would tell later on and cover a wider variety of topics. There isn't as much material covering COsby's best topic, childhood, and you get the sense that he was still in the process of finding his comedic voice. Stories like ""Street Football,"" and ""Lone Ranger,"" for example, are childhood musings in which Cosby talks about childhood rather reliving it as he does with his best routines. Nevertheless, if you are a fan of Cosby's old comic recordings, you will most likely still find plenty to enjoy here."
4,CHILD HOOD,"IT'S GREAT I STARTED OUT AS A CHILD MYSELF, LISTENING TO THIS RECORD THAT I STILL HAVE,AND NOW I HAVE THE CD.THIS IS JUST EXCELLENT BILL COSBY."
4,air shocks,"this is a good product i put them in myself and it took about 45 min to an hour, and I like my brakes. They have a nice ride to them . I approve"
1,Too boring for words.,I picked 'Moscow Mule' up at a local book shop as I'd been hitting a dry run in good reading references. Always do your research first kids; this is without a doubt one of the least thought-provoking books I've ever read. It wasn't even mildly entertaining and about as profound as microwave dinner. A grinding chore to read.
4,Great Point of View,I really enjoyed this story and I can't wait for the new school year to begin. We are going to use this version as well as others to teach point of view. I think this book will be a great help and I really believe the kids are going to love this new spin on an old tale.
4,Excellent Vocals and Powerful Lyrics,"I was just working in the office when one our employees had put Dudley's ""When I Worship You"" CD in the player. I normally don't pay much attention to what is playing in the office, but right away this CD got my attention. His vocals were very unusual both soothing at the same time. I thought this was an excellent musical project. It brought a calm into the office and the end of our day. A true worship experience indeed. The many soft styles are really well mixed, and Dudley's way of interpreting a song is second to none that I have heard. He sings with so much emotion, that you are swept up into his world, and began to feel his heart. I was very glad I had the chance to hear this very accomplished singer."
1,diaspointed,"received book in great condition only to discover black pen crossed off the name of a school library in my own town, tacky"
5,Selected Short Stories - Joseph Conrad (Wordsworth Classics),"This is a wonderful primer to the writings of Joseph Conrad! Each of the short stories are great reads in their own right and Conrad's gift of introducing complex themes of modernism, class conflict, race and political topics while effectively hiding his own opinions of those topics in favor letting the reader draw his or her own conclusions is for lack of a better word, grand."
1,Not impressed and frustrated,"I am an avid reader of many different books but this book frustrated me. I read one story, I was really getting frustrated at how each sentence was 5-6 lines instead of one or two. Each line with so many commas and so many sentences made this a difficult read for me. I thought of giving it a second chance so I read the second story and again the same thing. Books are enjoyable to read, good authors make it like a real life drama is happening in front of you. But this book doesn't do that. Sorry but I won't recommend this to anyone. I am so ashamed that I even threw the book in trash instead of keeping it in my personal collection."
2,Orphan,"It may be a good webcam, but be advised that the product is discontinued and the manufacturer does not have downloadable drivers in their website. If you decide to spend this (not cheap) price, make sure you keep your CD in a safe place."
1,Fast shipping - inferior product,The shipping time was excellent but the product is inferior. The pan is made of very thin plastic and has already cracked (in less than 3 weeks).
4,Ear Plugs,Product was delivered as expected. But a little factory dust or something was on ear plugs not sure if it was for a purpose. Anyway I was satisfied.
5,Fine,"Fine item, works as well as the originals that I lost recently. There were no issues with the fit and they feel as soft as the originals."
2,You get what you pay for,"These replacements work, but they're clearly made out of some sort of cheap rubber. it gets dirty particularly quickly and doesn't conform as well"
3,Flimsier than the originals,"I lost one earbud on vacation, so I ordered this as a replacement. It fits, but the rubber is much thinner than the stock ones. So if you're like me and you choose this style of earbud for the noise isolation, it might be worth going with the brand-name replacements."
4,Great for Sony NWZ-A818 but there is a better earbud Cushion,This set of Earbud cushions are replacement for the earbuds cushions that came with Sony MP3 Walkman NWZ-A818 and they sound really nice except that they don't last and easily fall off. They are comfortable but you may find that one or both cushions can detach and get lost like mine did. I found a better replacement inSony EPEX10A/BLK Hybrid Replacement Earbuds (Black)which even though not made for SONY NWZ-A818 nevertheless fit perfectly with no chance of getting detached.
5,So Happy They Fit,"For the price, I was convinced these would not fit my Sony earphones after I lost a bud while running. But they do and they work perfectly. Amazing price for anyone who loses a bud!"
2,Not Authentic Sony Replacements,"It read in the product description that these replacement cushions were by Sony. Unfortunately they are not. Sony's are colored in the inside of the cushion ie: white for large, green for med & orange for small and these are all black. They do fit my existing plugs but not the way my original cushions did, they are not as secure or tight fitting because they say stuck in my ear and need tweezers to remove them. I could glue them, but that will eventually wear out. As per the other review, the opening of these buds are in fact noticeably larger. They look similar but once you compare them to the original Sony cushions you'll see that they are not by Sony."
4,Another winner from Betty Neels,"Readers of Betty Neels will recognize some familiar elements in this story: a Dutch surgeon (Ivo van Doelen); an impoverished English miss (Serena Lightfoot, who is estranged from her uncaring family); a beautiful Dutch home, complete with the best servants; commutes between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Serena needs a job and Ivo provides her with one, but not one she had in mind! The romance between the two is enjoyable and easy to follow, not a lot of details to keep in mind. I enjoyed how Betty wove in characters from previous books. She also provides more insight into the mind of the male hero than usual. Of course, there are the usual misunderstandings to work out and people who aren't what they seem. But it wraps up into a nice ending with a different twist."
5,An understated documentary gem,"This is one of the best, and least known, documentaries of the last few years, a personal and poignant exploration of an American farm family's struggle to hold onto their legacy. The director is cousin to many of the people he interviewed, and he manages to elicit some strikingly honest and at times profoundly moving testimony from his extended clan. Spanning a hundred years of rural history, ""American Farm"" explores the increasing difficulty of holding onto tradition in the modern world. A haunting and heartfelt elegy for a way of life that is rapidly vanishing in this country. Not to be missed."
3,"Compelling subject matter, poor editing","The demise of the American Farm is a compelling subject. How did we go from a 40% agrarian to 2% society in less than two generations?However, there is a lot of gabbing by the interviewees that evoke small lives rather than the big picture.The poor video and editing quality is more like family videos rather than documentary material.There were not enough cuts. Not enough juxtapositions.Too much unmediated talking by people who just know their own lives and do not see themselves as part of a pattern (perhaps some pointed questions would have provoked them to give better answers). There should have been narration or some attempt to place this family in a larger context and a historical timeline, census figures or economic trends.A MUCH better farm documentary is Troublesome Creek: A Midwestern. That interspersed the family within broader trends."
4,Explaining the school play,"I just wanted to respond to Bonita's review because when I read her review, I originally hesitated about buying the book. As she mentioned, the school play being presented is Little Red Riding Hood, as clearly shown on a sign on the stage. So the elderly woman who is bound in a closet is Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother who has been tied up by the big bad wolf. And the African-American with the bow and arrows is not a ""pretend Native American,"" but rather the hero of the play, the woodcutter who has come to save Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother."
1,Not Factory OEM for Acura TSX,"It is the exact size but half the wiper suspends in the air, and very filmsy attachment. Went to the dealer and got a refill for the original wiper."
4,Forget the text. Enjoy the cartoons,"Robert Mankoff, the Cartoon Editor of the NY Times has written the book purportedly as a learning guide for prospective cartoonists. Well, I don't want to be a cartoonist, but I do love cartoons, especially those found in the New Yorker. In leafing through the book I began having doubts that the text of the book would provide much help for a fledgling cartoonist. After awhile you simply become oblivious to the written material and hone in on the many delightful cartoons. As the book says there are 400 of them in this volume, and, to me, that justified the purchase price.This book is certainly as good as any of the other books that form part of the New Yorker cartoon book library, and if you are a devotee of pictorial humor do pick up a copy."

1,Pure waffle,This book bored me to tears. Its not insightful - it doesnt really tell you ho wto be funny or how to come up with great cartoons. It just gives you a bunch of the authors cartoons and has the author waffle on about how good he is and what he was doing when he drew it etc. If you've ever read a book and thought - well did he actually say anything there then this is it. Terribel book. I was very disappointed. There are some great books on cartooning and this sure isnt one of them.
1,CONTAINS CHEMICALS KNOW IN CA TO CAUSE CANCER & BIRTH DEFECTS,"This discus came in a box that states, WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. I think this should be noted in the description! This will be returned:("
5,55 Year Hiatus,"When I was in the Army 55 years ago, I was first introduced to this book by a fellow soldier who lent me a copy. At the time, I was 20 years old and not yet a Catholic, but I immediately took to the book and loved it. When I found it here on Amazon, I welcomed the opportunity to acquire and re-read it. If you have any interest in St. Francis, you too will probably love this book. My interest has been lifelong."
2,The Little Flowers of St. Francis,"Pleasant read however historically unreliable. If you compare this account of St. Francis, to the earlier biography by Thomas of Celano you will find several inconsistancies and embelishments which are unsupported by evidence. If you are looking for a more reliable historical account of the life of St. Francis I would recommend that you check out the biography by Thomas of Celano as it was written much closer to St. Francis' lifetime and likely more realistic."
2,"Good book, Shady seller","I bought this book as a present. It was listed as new. The book arrived just in time for me to wrap it and give it. When it was unwrapped and leafed through, we found that somebody had written on a couple of the pages. Needless to say, I was unhappy. Thankfully the receiver of the gift was a good sport about it.Zero stars for the seller, Four stars for the book."
5,Great CPU runs fine upgrading Lenovo C200,Runs cool;use same power as the stock Core duo CPU;Much better power management;Only take five minutes to update the CPU.Highly recommended!
1,not impressed,"The shoes did not look like they had pointed toes, and wheb i got them i was very upset. I sent them back months ago."
1,A biased and incorrect view on how to raise a child,"I admire Dr. Kris Bhat's effort in producing this book. While he has taken the time to cover almost all aspects of a child's development, his advice falls on deaf ears. Essentially, Dr. Bhat writes a book for the ignorant and feeble-minded. His opinions are biased and sexist a majority of the time and just plain silly. For example, Dr. Bhat will flat out condemn a long hairstyle in boys unless, of course, he is an artisan. Furthermore, Bhat displays his confused state of mind by proclaiming ""girls cry alot and get upset very quickly."" Why the misconceptions of one man are now available for people to read at 30 dollars a pop is beyond me. Another thing Dr. Bhat can use is a decent editor, as grammatical errors are common throughout the text, and the writing style never materializing to be better than a 2nd-grader's."
1,??,"I feel that Dr. Bhat's ideology on how an Indo-American family should raise their children is sexist and ""behind the times."" While his views may be shared with other older Indo-Americans, the new generation has grown up in a country with much more liberation than their parents. It is absurd for him to say that the mother should ""always be there when their children arrive home from school."" This gives her no freedom of her own. It is also impossible to prevent teenagers from dating nowadays. To condemn it like some sort of evil is extremely opinionated against modern American culture. Personally, I don't believe that the woman should be subservient to the man - all people are created equal."
5,Sorely needed by American families and Indo-Americans.,"This is the type of book that teaches parents and reminds them of ""what made America strong,"" and by not applying these principles, what can tear it down. It is a ""How To Book."" This book extols the same ideas and family values that America's pioneers built this great country upon. We need to get back to these principles; or, America, as we all know it will continue to deterioate into oblivion. A ""Guide To Indo-American Parenting: For Indians Rearing Children in America,"" by Dr. Kris Bhat, MD, is not just for Indians; but, is for all who want to maintain a stronger, more productive America into the future for one's self and children, and their fellow man. The book extols values taught early in the home extrapolate to everyday life. The books speaks about money concerns, dating, discipline, homework, computer use, allowances, and other problems unique to the American culture."
4,Great book but there are other perspectives out there,"Overall I found this book a very good read. The structure and story are very well thought out. At some stages I questioned the evidence discussed and was dissapointed by the corresponding web site that has not been updated for quite some time. For a different perspective to I would recommend Edward L. Dreyer's ""Zheng He: China and the Oceans in the Early Ming Dynasty, 1405-1433"" as it shed's light on areas where Gavin Menzies skirts over."
5,A gift for my dad,I bought this book as a gift for my father who is very interested in history and expanding his knowledge on all subjects. He enjoyed it very much and said that it presented a side of history he'd never known about before.
2,Stick to the facts please Mr Menzies,"A very readable book, but sadly, as noted below, many of the conclusions are quite tenuous and have a hearty dose of speculation. Perhaps the Chinese did travel somewhat extensively, but I sadly cannot trust this book to give me the facts"
4,Menzies makes sense,"Menzies has brought a common sense (or in this case a Navigator's sense)to re-examine the widely accepted belief that Columbus discovered America.In a well reasoned and well written book, he asks questions which are pertinent to the foundations of that belief. In so doing, he follows the footsteps of Thor Heyerdahl and Tim Severin in showing that it is possible that factual history may differ from interpreted history. Was Columbus the first to discover America? We already know that the Vikings got to one part of America long before Columbus; so is it possible, as Menzies suggests, that Columbus was yoyaging to a destination already know to him rather than into the unknown?. Menzies may not (yet) have proven his case, but he raises questions that are not so easy to answer. If nothing else, his book is fascinating in providing answers which make a great deal of professional sense."
1,Not worth your time or money,"I had to buy this book for a theology class. I would have to say that this is genuinely one of the worst books on Christian doctrine that I have ever read in my entire life. The whole theme is ""Paul on Oprah"". Really? Have we stooped this far? Why should we stoop to the level of pop television in order to make sense of the Apostle Paul? I cannot ever recommend this book to anyone."
1,Terrible,"Cherry-picks quotes to support his case while ignoring the most famous and controversial that go against his case. It reads like the author doesn't understand the actual reason Paul is so ""problematic."""
4,Excellent coming of age story,"For the first few pages of this book, I expected to dislike it - its language was awkward, much like a poor translation. However, once the story developed its own momentum, the language became natural, pleasant to read.The book is an excellent story of coming of age in a changing culture - the elders seemingly fail to understand the youth that has some education. These youth are caught in the middle; they don't want to farm in the traditional way yet they lack sufficient education for it to provide employment. They are in the middle in another sense - they are the children of the civil war. This leads to their coming of age event to be a wrestling match rather than a dance. Quietly and wisely in the background, several village elders orchestrate the events to teach the youth a lesson - in war everyone loses.While this novel is unlikely to become a world classic, it is well worth reading."
5,Excellent,"This is the best book I have found so far on CompTIA's security exam. It is clear, concise, and very well laid out. I was able to find the areas I had trouble with. Many of the concepts were easier to grasp than the way my instructor presented the information."
2,"Spring works for about 12"" worth of cutting","The spring action, which is the primary reason anyone would buy these things, is extremely bad, lasting only a very short time. The blades are very sharp, but they do not ""spring back"" after each cut. As a result, I have to manually open them after each cut, not an easy task when there are not two rings into which to insert fingers. I saw another review where the person took them apart and reassembled them, but why on earth should that be necessary with a brand new set of scissors, especially ones that are not inexpensive."
5,Worked great!,Made my first rag quilt this month and used these scissors. They worked very well! Would recommend this to anyone.
3,Different name or different scissors?,"I also ordered the ""rag quilt"" snips but the package I received calls them ""Hobby Snips"". Not knowing if they had changed the name I went ahead and opened them to use on a flannel rag quilt. After snipping halfway around the edges (only 2 layers) the snips started sticking and not springing open when cutting. I decided to try a couple drops of sewing machine oil on the blade at the joint. It seemed to do the trick and the snips started opening properly. In addition, I was pleased as I was able to snip through 6 layers of flannel with relative ease - they are very sharp. However, halfway into clipping all the seams, they started sticking again. I reapplied oil in two places and that seemed to get them working again. I don't like the idea of having to apply oil so much but they do work - at least for one quilt. I have more rag quilts to make and if they stop working I will add to this review."
2,Wish I had read before I purchased,Worked wonderful in the beginning but half way through my rag quilt and they started to get a stuck feeling! Purchase another brand!
4,Raviolies!,Works well. The narrow width makes it idea for sheets rolled by the kitchen Aid Pasta roller attachment. The key is getting a good seal between the top and bottom layers of pasta. I use a larger roller that works mcuh better than the included roller. I am going to use it next to create homemade pizza rolls! Heavy duty and easy to clean.
1,dough sticks to the form,"I'm guessing you need really dry pasta, because it's hard to seperate the pasta from the form without tearing the pasta. I ripped more than I made, so definately will not be using it again. Instead, I'll invest in a pasta cutting wheel."
5,Perfect ravioli from home,"My daughter and I just finished our first ever batch of ravioli using this maker. It is awesome! Our advice is follow the written instructions as given with the maker. Extra flour kept the pasta from sticking to the mold and using only one tsp of filling produced perfect spinach ravioli. I also used the back side of a teaspoon to help cut the edges rather than just using the little rolling pin. An awesome product. If you know how to make the sheets of pasta, you can easily make ravioli. One batch of dough made 4 dozen ravioli. Reading other reviews helped me to select this. I hope you enjoy your ravioli mold, too."
1,Item was not a Villaware product as advertised.,I returned the product because it stated it was a Villaware product when it wasn't. The Villaware product is made of steel and this product just has a shiny coating on it. I was rather disappointed with the misleading product information.
3,A Pleasant Surprise.,"Celestial Seasonings Roastaroma tea has a intensely coffe-like aroma. There is a distinctive flavour, which hints at something like coffee. There is a somewhat bitter aftertaste if steeped too long.I am a Mormon and do not drink coffe or black/green tea. I enjoyed coffee for years...quite the coffee lover as any of my family and friends would agree. Giving it up was a hardship and I truly missed the flavour.Herbal teas are nice, but get old in a hurry and they need a bit of sweetening to really taste good. Roastaroma can take a bit of sweetener, if that's how you liked your coffee. I always use cream alone and it mellows the roastaroma nicely into an enjoyable cup.Overall a good product. Only drawback is it is nearly impossible to find at your local grocer. Buying the product online requires the additional shipping and handling fees which really make the product quite expensive."
4,"Affordable, Effective and Delicious","This drink is a great product for those of us unable to ingest caffeine. But you'll probally have to do some tinkering around with it to get the appropriate 'coffee' flavor desired.It would help consumers if the company proactively suggested only making it with milk (of various kinds) to begin with (package directions?). Steeping it in mik is precisely what ended up making it taste like coffee.I was then unable to quit making cups for myself! I've gone through boxes so quickly, I know that I will have to start buying this product in bulk.Using water, you get black water with a faint hint of cinamon and other spices. And it won't taste like coffee."
5,This Tea Is Amazing,I have drank coffee for years and have now found myself needing to stop drinking it for health reasons. I have tried other coffee substitutes in the past and none of them were worth drinking or giving up coffee. I just bought this today at the health food store and it tastes as good if not better than any cup of coffee I have ever drank. Of coarse I did add my favorite creamer Coffee Mate Belgian Chocolate Toffee and a little Hazelnut stevia to it that made it so yummy. It wasn't weak like some teas can be when you're use to a bold cup of coffee. I believe I've finally found the coffee substitute that I will be able to use to stop drinking coffee and save a little money not going to Starbucks all the time. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to have a great substitute for a good cup of coffee. Celestial Seasonings out did themselves with this incredible coffee substitute.
4,A great guide for future dive enthusiasts!,"As a diver, I am asked to speak to elementary schools on my experiences under the water. I found this book, full of wonderful pictures and easy to understand explanations of the coral reef, to be a great guide to suggest to the teachers prior to my visit. They have found the book to be a great guide in teaching their students about the coral reef. It also prepares them for my visit and loads them with tons of questions to ask me! A very useful book for future divers, one that will peak their curiousity and promote a yearn to see what the coral reef is really like!"
3,"Not perfect, but is sure fulfills its purpose","Even though the cover leaves some openings my daughter was able to use to reach some of the buttons, it was a complete turn off and my daughter is not interested in toying with my DVR anymore."
2,too big for dvd player,"This is a piece of clear plexiglass that is the length of you dvd player and is angled at 90 degrees, so that you attach velcro (included) to the top of the dvd player and then to the plexiglass and the other part of the clear guard actually protects the buttons. It says that if your dvd player is too short to use the longer side, reverse it and use the longer side of the guard on the player and the shorter side to cover the buttons. I understand, but it was still too big. I have a Sony DVD player that is 1.5 inches high and the short side of the guard is 2.25 inches high. So since the guard would not lay flat, there is no way this would keep my son from getting into the dvd player. I thought about putting a book under the player, but I think he would just lift it and get into it.If your dvd player is less than 2.25 inches high, this will not work for you."
4,eh.,"This is a decent product. It, for the most part, does it's job; however, it is difficult to manage when you want to actually use the DVD/VHS/whatever player b/c you have to lift up the player and undo the velcro in order to insert/remove a DVD/VHS/whatever. So, it kept the little tyke from pushing buttons and inserting things into the players (for now), but does require added effort for actually using your electronic devices. Still, it's cheaper than buying a new DVD player!"
2,Not what I thought,"If you know nothing at all about tequila then this book is for you. If you know anything about tequila then this book will bore you. It is too factual, too much about the distilleries that the average consumer would never need to know. Even though it was updated in '02 it is hopelessly out of date already. The price online is way too high. I bought it direct from the publisher for $37"
1,unless your donald trump,i wouldn't waste your money on this book. The only way i can describe it is useless. Unless you plan on starting a donald trump sized electrical business with 500 employees. This book is all about running a huge business and has about one reference to the electrical field in it. Anyone starting an electrical contracting business isn't gonna start anywhere within the scope of this book.
3,Good study,This book is a good study for another perspective on operating an electrical business. Getting opinions and help from many different sources can dramatically inproove your results in the long run.
2,not stunning,"This CD had a few good moments but it just seems limited, somehow. I enjoyed watching the singer on the ""Rock Star"" show, and was disappointed when she was voted off. I was keen to hear her own work, and so I bought this album. It's disappointing though. Maybe the song about women getting drunk put me off? The album as a whole didn't shine though, and I'm afraid I can't really recommend it to anyone. Sorry."
4,Rock Star INXS' Butterfly Girl shines on solo CD,"Heather Luttrell only lasted till the 4th week on Rock Star INXS, but her amazing version of Somebody to Love on Week 2 made me want to hear more. She obviously wasn't right for INXS, but doing her own thing, she sounds super. Her style is part blues, part classic rock, and all great. There's not a bad cut on this album."
2,Probably not Frayn's best...,"The book is an irritating dichotomy. A tightly woven,well-structured plot compliments an economical stock of carefully crafted and intriguing if ultimately plebian characters. At the same time the book preaches it is tedious and not terribly interesting. Frayn's stream of consciousness works well, though it falls short of Faulkner. Unfortunately, interesting questions remained unanswered, such as the teasing fascination of Jessel's family relationships and his resolution of an old love affair. The book is not in the least bit funny and should not be considered a comedy. I have the most profound respect for Mr. Frayn and his integrity. That's what makes the book so frustrating to read. I KNOW he can do better. It was as if he hadn't proofread his own work. The bittersweet description of this sordid love affair is painful and well worth the experience of reading but, in all, the book, as a work, fails."
4,"Hey, I was THERE.","Great Plains, I must tell you, were not recognized as a great band in their time by a lot of people who saw them in Columbus campus area bars in the '80's, usually as an opening act for somebody better known. Ron House's offbeat eloquence was difficult to grasp when encountered for the first time in live performance. The band's performances could be frantic and, to put it mildly, unpolished, and they were even thrown off the stage once at Columbus's annual 'Comfest,' not exactly a venue with high standards for musicianship. It was on record that the creativity came through, as this compilation attests. Little known and misunderstood in their day, Great Plains were one of the great quirky-sloppy bands of the '80's, and House is, beyond the sarcasm and occasionally annoying in-jokes, a lyricist of keen and poignant whimsy. And (some of) the tunes have hooks! May this CD set rise to well above the bottom of the charts, and bring a reassessment."
3,OK - but not all original songs,"Product from Canada. I'm not an expert on the songs, but to me, they do not sound original. ""Woman, Woman""could have been done by Gary Lewis, but that doesn't sound like him. If it's Gary Puckett, then theymislabeled the song. Songs are: 1. When A Man Loves A Woman - Percy Sledge 2. Save The Last Dance For Me - The Drifters 3. Woman, Woman - Gary Lewis 4. Lovin' Arms - Dobie Gray 5. Dizzy - Tommy Roe 6. Leaving It All Up To You - Dale & Grace 7. Great Pretender - The Platters 8. Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me - Gladys Knight & The Pips 9. Daydream - Lovin' Spoonful 10. The Letter - The Box Tops 11. Rocky - Austin Roberts 12. Jean - Oliver 13. Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head - B.J. Thomas 14. Help Me Make It Through The Night - Sammi Smith 15. Sundown - Steve Bess 16. Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye - The CasinosNo indication on artwork that these are original songs."
2,I want to like this book but I don't yet.,"It is too new age for me. I keep trying and going back because I believe in the healing effects of forgiveness. But I also do not excuse evil, and looking at the world, true evil exists, e.g., violence, hatred, genocides as in Darfur, child soldiers, etc. Just to explain it all away as lessons people need is rubbish, in my point of view. Am still re-reading to see if I can learn something new to be more forgiving but the law of attraction stuff is a huge hurdle for me to accept. If you come from a belief system, as I do, that real evil exists--the arguments will be hard to swallow."
4,What a blessing!,"This book goes beyond the idea of letting go of resentments, and recommends that you see challenging situations and people as actual blessings! It suggests that these events and people are in your life for the sole purpose of helping you heal old wounds, and grow in your ability to experience unconditional love.This book itself is a blessing, and I highly recommend it -- especially if you are blaming someone else for your unhappiness.Steven Lane Taylor, author of Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide for Living Life in the Divine Flow"
2,Not for everyone,"This is a great resource for people who find their healing in forgiving, or for those whose religious beliefs demand it, but like any therapy, it's not for everyone. Pressure to forgive their abusers lays an additional burden on some victims, and others feel forced to do something they dont' believe in. Well-meaning friends and relatives have forced books like this on trauma patients and unintentionally caused them additional pain. Not for everyone."
5,Radical Forgiveness,"This is an awesome book. It walks you completely through how to look at life lessons from the prospective of the contract you and another soul made before conception. These souls come to ""mirror"" our shadow side so we can work through the problem and continue on our spiritual path of healthy growth, evolving to as spiritual being as possible. Wonderfully written, easy to read! I am using this book as a helpful guide for many of my clients to help them realize why the same ""bad"" thing keeps happening over and over again. Once they look at it from Colin Tipping's perspective - it makes therapuetic movement come more quickly."
5,Great Book BUT Beware Other Items Offered on Website,"This is one of my favorite books in my spiritual library. Mr. Tipping consolidates and explains in a clear and new way many key spiritual principles. Reading the book and completing the free online Radical Forgiveness worksheets have helped me tremendously. I was looking for more regarding self-forgiveness, and purchased the online program. They offered a money back guarantee, so I figured I couldn't go wrong. The Self Forgiveness/Self Acceptance program is not substantially different from the free online Radical Forgiveness worksheet. I did not get additional benefit from it. I emailed them for a refund, but have been ignored. My opinion is that the book and the free online worksheet are the most valuable items offered by this organization and that the other stuff is repackaging of the same to make more money."
2,"New age mumbo-jumbo, but that is what I expected...","I can't say I was surprised by this book. It is a bunch of new age, touchy-feely, not really reasonable or relateable suggestions for helping people to cope with issues surrounding forgiveness. Unfortunately for this author, and I don't mean for this review to become a social commentary, if someone is unable to forgive, a book is not going to provide a whole lot of insight in to how to deal with these issues. Seek personal counseling with a licensed professional and your results will be worth the time and the money (and most insurance plans are now covering mental health)."
3,Light bulb moment from Radical Forgivness,"Jill's story resonated with me in a very personal way. I was able to understand some things that were happening in my life in a way that I would have never ""gotten"" with out reading this book. I bought two extra ones. One to give to a friend and one to loan to anyone that is interested."
1,Radical Forgiveness,i ordered this book in advance and i never got it. So i can not comment. It's been 4 months since i ordered it.Sure wish i would get it soon.
4,"Not finished yet, but has helped me already.","It is not very easy to apply this Radical Forgiveness in real life, but I found it could be helpful to solve some issues, or direct the way of thinking about many things happened everyday. Not bad experience with this book and its concept."
2,Forgive but not necessarily forget,"The author makes some valid points when it comes to not keeping yourself in the victim role and forgiving to move on. I just don't buy that a person can do so without examining the past. That doesn't mean rehashing the past to death but it can't be ignored either. No matter how well of a job you think you've done with forgiving and letting go, unless you deal with the underlying issue, it will come creeping back at some point."
4,"Interesting Concept, Good Process, Not Sure I Buy It","Perhaps part of the fault is mine. When I purchased this book, I expected something from a Christian, rather than New Age, perspective. Still, the perspective is an interesting one. Basically, all of the crappy situations we go through are our souls working together with the souls of the other people involved to help teach us a lesson or resolve something, ""to learn and grow"".If you want to learn more about the five steps, just google Radical Forgiveness Worksheet. The author has a lot of free tools on his website--and that will let you see the process.I think that if one were to employ this, one would truly view the world in a different light--which would be beneficial. I'm just not so sure that I believe that it's all a part of our souls conspiring with other souls to help us grow--but it's a nice idea.The book itself, IMHO, was too long. But still, I think if you read the opening chapters and skip around a bit--you'll get what you need."
5,"Techniques that embrace accountability, faith, and the basics of developing a forgiving attitude","RADICAL FORGIVENESS provides a new five-stage process for letting go of anger and blame and finding peace in any situation. New age, health, and psychology collections alike will welcome the idea of forgiveness and the easy-to-use techniques that embrace accountability, faith, and the basics of developing a forgiving attitude."
2,Shocked how easily this broke,"Two weeks ago we bought two of these glasses because our cat has taken to knocking stemware over for kicks. The kitty didn't happen to get hold of this one, so I can't say if it's catproof, but dig this:The empty glass was knocked off of a 2"" high table and fell onto thick carpet. As it fell, the bowl rolled towards the metal table leg and struck it with diminishing force. Where the leg touched the glass, the bowl cracked in a zigzag pattern, but did not shatter. So plus one star for not leaving glass everywhere, but otherwise, not impressed."
1,Great at first.....,"I bought a set of 6 of these glasses a year ago as our Reidel glasses kept slowly breaking, and these were supposed to be bullet-proof. One year later, they're all gone. Drop them on the floor, no problem, but they seem to develop microcracks around the rim and you'll be washing one and it will shatter into a zillion pieces. At the end of the day, the Reidel slowly break, but over the last year, we lost one Reidel Cabernet glass to 6 of the Schott-Zwiesel Bourdeaux glasses."
5,Fantastic Glass,"I have been using these glasses for years and while they are not unbreakable, they are so much stronger than anything else of this quality. And this quality is quite high. I use these for parties and gatherings and have only lost 1 or 2 after thousands of uses, I can not say that about the competition's glasswear, which breaks if you sneeze on it. Highly recommended."
5,Great Reference Book,"My avian vet suggested this book. I have two birds and am somewhat of a novice. This book has a ton of information from selecting a bird to traveling with your bird, feeding, healthcare, and behavior. I recommend this book to all humans owned by a bird! It's concise, clever and easy to read. If you care about your avian friend, you should have a great reference book near-by, and this one is great."
3,Okay,"This is a very informative book, I just wish it had color photos of all the different types of birds"
3,Good Start,"I found this book to be filled with wonderful ""starter"" information. However, once I actually had the bird I found that I had several questions that the book at best glossed over.In short if, you are going to buy a bird start here. Then once you buy a bird supplement this book with more in depth information on behavior and training."
4,"Wonderful reference book, and teaches the new bird owner","My boyfriend and i are interested in buying a bird, and are still deciding on what bird is right for us. But in the mean time we are reading as much as possible to learn and get ready for the future adoption. This book is a wonderful starter book and a reference manual. If you are interested in adopting a bird, this is a great place to start. It teaches just how much effort is needed to have a bird in your home and how much joy you can out of it. Adopting a bird is in no way like having a cat or dog, it requires lots more time and effort, and i think this book conveys that."
3,An interesting satire...,"An interesting satire on the economy clash of 2008..but just like any other set of intertwined opinions, this one also needs to be taken a pinch of salt. It does tells us about capitalism and corporations and how it has all resulted in the current issues. But keep in mind that every system, be it capitalism, socialism, or a mix, has its own pros & cons. Anything when taken to its extreme will result in out-of-control situations. Thus, it won;t be fair to say that the system was bad..rather the way it was operated was bad.Anyway, this DVD is worth to keep in your shelf for future generations to show them the lessons learned and mistakes to be avoided."
5,Wow!,"Michael keep it up. In the many many years I have lived I have learned that the people need films like ""Capitalism"" to wake them up. I wait eagerly for the sequel."
2,Poorly done,I agree completely with the topics but Michael Moore does a poor job and waters down the message with worthless antics.
2,Terribly done movie,The movie isn't as fun as the colombine film was. There is one part that is good and that's when he drives the armored truck up to the banks in NYC demanding the taxmoney back.
3,"Buy ""Inside Job"" Instead","This was a bit of a let down after watching ""Inside Job"", which is a GREAT film if you want to find out how we got where we are today -- and who's to blame. I am a fan of Michael Moore; however, now that I've seen most of his films, it's getting a bit tiresome and predictable to watch him do the same antics over and over again. He ought to work on getting more interviews, rather than harrassing the poor security people at the front doors. One winner here is the Special Feature segment with Chris Hedges."
2,It has got an area code for the US and Canada,"You should be clearly informed before buying that DVD ( not just""one of the ordered films may have an area code"") that it's no use ordering that film in a European country, as the area code prevents the film from being watched."
1,Steal this movie ... and destroy it,"If you would pay to view or own this, you're a damn fool. Got any money in your pocket? Your bank account? Wake up this morning looking to earn some scratch? Can't wait to get your hands on some of that populace-bleeding, government-enforced compassionate ""health care"" loot?A quick detail from Wikipedia this morning of March 29:""The film opened in eighth place at the box office on the first weekend of its wide release, grossing $4,447,378.[9] The final domestic total was $14,115,489.[1]""Got a brain? Lose this manipulative con artist ... vote with your feet and keep your cash for yourself. You've earned it, not him."
1,Moore Propaganda,"Once again Michael Moore delves into the world of halve truths to make a point. Forget about whether or not you agree with him; how can you condone his methods. Anyone who studies economic thought, honestly, knows that capitalist are not thieves; but thieves use capitalism just like they use socialism. True capitalist are those who find something people want and provide it for them at a price people are willing to pay. In this since Michael Moore is a capitalist, though his methods are dishonest; so that really makes him a thief. Moore's films are a diversion into his USSR Socialist thought and not worth the time to watch (that would be a capitalistic thought."
1,Michael moore: Another lie story for him to steal money from idiots,"Not even good enough to use as a leveler for uneven furniture. I am amazed at the hypocrisy of a guy who has become a millionare claiming to expose the hypocrisy of millionares. I am amazed at the idiots that sip from this trough of drool.You mindless droids of the progressive need to hop on the next raft headed for Cuba or S America to join the revolution of comrade Hugo... Oh... they are all coming the other way, why is that?. Best use of this disc.... target practice at the skeet range."
1,A Must Watch if You Enjoy Hypocritical Humor,"Another very monolithic movie from MM. If you, like me, find humor in watching hypocrites in action you will love this movie. MM has always been a master of deception-by-omission and this movie is no exception. MM hates capitalism and if you purchase this movie you are supporting capitalism. Would MM really want you to support capitalism by purchasing this movie? I didn't think so either."
1,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Mikey One-Note!","He's back and he's madder than ever. Why? Mr. Moore is the beneficiary of all facets of the American System. He can spew his vitriol with complete freedom. He is a multi-millionaire thanks to our CAPITALIST system (or perhaps he'd be happier making films in Cuba, with the State claiming all profits). Our top-of-the-line health care system keeps his blood pressure under 200/100. And it sure doesn't look like he's been missing too many meals. But, for some reason, he's dedicated his life to an attempt to tear down America. I saw him on TV the other day; it seems his latest target is Obama, whom Mikey now feels isn't being far-left enough. In this film he claims to be exposing capitalism's faults, but what he's exposing isn't the system but plain, old-fashioned corruption therein. And we all know there's no corruption in countries under the sway of Mikey's beloved communism. Right, Mikey?"
3,Disc stopped in the middle of the movie,"I liked the little bit I saw, but couldn't see the rest, because the disc did not load properly. Michael Moore is a fantastic producer and I love all of his movies."
4,"Interesting, but not his best work","""Capitalism"" is interesting, but no longer as thought-provoking as his previous works. In some sense, ""Capitalism"" shows Michael Moore's allegiance to a country he loves. Generally, Moore (and his work) is one you will either love or hate... there is no middle ground. This movie is not his best work, but it is still stirring and somewhat informative. Some might say it is one-sided, and others will agree. The examples presented are extreme and engaging, but maybe it is what we need to motivate ourselves to do what we can to get out of the hole we are in right now. Capitalism works, and it works for the many, but capitalism works well only for the few. I probably will not recommend this movie as a ""must-see."" But it can be entertaining if you have an open mind."
4,"A good doccumentary, but not his best.","I liked this movie. I've watched all Michael Moore movies and, by now, I was gettin a little tired with his one-dimension remarks. He was extremely radical in denouncing other radicals, if you knwo what I mean. One side only.In this one, he's a little bit more moderate, although still going for the jugular. In the end, what I perceive is that capitalism is not an evil; but to let capitalism live without ANY form of regulation by the government is suicide."
4,This is the Documentary that the Banks don't want you to see.,In this documentary Moore investigates how default swaps and other useless financial products caused the 2008 financial collapse and subsequent bailout. He shows us how backroom deals at the capitol pushed a bailout that most citizens didn't want.He also shows how creepy corporations can be. For instance they take out life insurance on employees -- not their executives -- regular hourly workers. When the employee dies and the families are struggling just to pay funeral expenses the corporations cash in. After this story Wal-Mart discontinued this policy.This is the third Michael Moore film I've seen. I loved them all. I've also watched some documentaries that attack Moore's movies. While they have some valid points to consider they fail to produce any satisfactory evidence that any of Moore's stories are false. They were so boring I can't remember their names. Moore's movies are entertaining and informative.
4,"Michael points out ""Hypocracy""","He definitely points out the hypocracy of the ""capitalism is always right"" crowd.As always he merely points out the obvious (in stark detail)and thenposes questions that should be asked - then he waits for the far right tolambaste him (calling him a commie) for daring to be patriotic enough to askwhy we don't deserve better. He's a true ""brave american"".I wouldn't say it was his best movie, but it should be shown in the public schools."
1,What a piece of tripe...can't believe I wasted my money,"As a lifelong small business owner I found Moore's book full of innuendo and just outright demagoguery. Of all the condescending attitudes, he has the gall to rip the capital system which allowed this country to produce the best, the most advanced, and the most sought after economy the world has ever known. His insipid book sells for $19 and I doubt his philanthropicism will have him `giving it away' any time soon (although I can not imagine anyone buying it after they know what is in it). NO, Mr. Moore suggest that the very system that pays him royally for his errant rant of a book is the same one we should tear down and abandon. What a hypocrite. What a liar. Mike, I want my money back; if I lied to my customers and misrepresented the truth like you do, I would be in front of a judge and a jury of my peers."
4,Capitalism: A Love Story,This documentary really makes one think about our country and our future. Very well done. I ordered another copy and sent it to my sister. She and her husband liked it too.
5,Love Michael Moore.,Michael Moore always hits the nail on the head when getting his point across. I LOVE Michael Moore films. <3
3,Too much like a liberal version of Rush Limbaugh,"This film is entertaining and engaging but is far too slanted to the left and has too much content that is separated from reality for me to want to call it a documentary. There are a lot of comments from laid-off auto workers who are upset that they aren't getting the deal they expected from the auto companies. Welcome to life my friends. Things have changed over the last 50 years.After spending some time watching people being upset with not getting their house paid for or their retirement reinstated, the film just got to be too irritating for me and I turned it off. I'm a registered Democrat and I support much of the left wing agenda. This though has nothing to do with a liberal viewpoint as it does with what I can only imagine is Michael Moore's still bruised ego over having lost his job years ago."
3,Preaching to the Converted,"Regardless of your political alignment with Michael Moore, he is a solid filmmaker and 'Capitalism' is a very entertaining movie. In fact, on a level of sheer entertainment, I'd say it's definitely a contender for his best. He's got his guerrilla invasions of corporate headquarters and institutions down to a science, and he's certainly adept at pressing emotional button. Moore's main problem is in his journalism. Many of his main points reek of spin and he is not objective at all. I know that he's not technically a journalist, but I think that his films target very serious topics that require pristine fact checking. For those that are more to the left with Moore, they will obviously not be too distracted with this, but that are not in the same political sphere will have no problem punching MAck truck sized holes in his presentation."
4,Proud of Michael Moore's Quest to Take on the Big Banks,"I'm a big fan of Michael Moore. In his latest film, Michael Moore attacks the foreclosure crisis by showing families who have lost their homes because their mortgages skyrocketed. The banks are ruthless and they don't care about destroying people's lives. All they want to do is capitalize on others' misfortunes. It's sad commentary on the state of America. I had to fight back my tears.Michael Moore was hilarious in his quest to make citizen arrests of the big banks' CEOs. And I loved the commentary by spunky Ohio Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur. Congresswoman Kaptur represents the common person in America and I was so proud of her.Finally, Michael Moore showed the power of community organizing. We as the people can affect real change in our nation. All-in-all, this is film that you'll want to add to your ""must see"" list."
4,And average Moore documentary,"Michael Moore... by now, most people should know what they're getting with his movies by now.A strong dose of anti-establishmentarianism thrown together without much consideration for flow or story line. Moore's goal is to motivate his audience, exposing them to pieces of information they may not be aware of. If you want cited sources and in-depth analysis, you've come to the wrong place.The central theme, if any, is that corporate America does not represent the needs of the average American. If you can't agree with that you either haven't been paying attention, or have a CEO (or higher) position."
4,In-your-face Examination of a Doctrine.,"This is a harsh examination of a doctrine that has gone unchallenged and unquestioned for far too long. The principles of Capitalism have indoctrinated every aspect of American life: from education (elementary school through college) to economic principles (virtually every economic activity) to our very way of life (our lives are driven by consumerism and prosperity).By examining the details and real-life consequences of Capitalism, this movie puts a spotlight on how utterly ridiculous, unfair and unsustainable this doctrine is. Capitalism inevitably leads to the concentration of power and wealth in a select few (a different group of ""select few"" than the royalty of medieval times or the rulers of Roman and Greek times) at the expense of the rest of humanity."
2,"It's ""Corporate Socialism"" ... not Capitalism.","Michael Moore blames ""capitalism"" for the economic problems in this country. He is mistaken; it is ""corporate socialism"" that is at fault.When the judge (in the documentary) was sentencing juveniles into a privatized detention complex, we viewers are led to believe that this is an example of capitalism run amok. Wrong! Because this involved government money being funneled into a private company, it's really corporate socialism.In contrast, within a ""free enterprise"" system, private companies are allowed to succeed or fail on their own merits -- without government subsidies. Michael Moore needs to do his homework."
5,A GREAT MOVIE,GREAT JOB MICHAEL. The most powerful part is the beginning which shows Reagan's role. The rest is awesome too. It's a historical documentation on what went wrong with America.
4,"Good, but could have been better","This documentary is Mr. Moore's latest commentary on the American business community. Made in the wake of the real estate bubble burst and the onset of the ""Great Recession"", this movie feels like a sequel to Mr. Moore's previous hit ""Roger and Me"". This time, he focuses on Wall Street and the major US banks. He zooms in on the TARP bailout, and highlights some of the abuses of the money. There is also a great section on how corporations often buy life insurance on their employees, betting that these employees would then die. The movie ends on a high note with a look at the Obama administration and on specific instances, it has went against big business. My only beef with this movie is its lack of citations of major laws passed with regards to corporate regulation."
5,Moving and a must see! Moore's best movie yet.,I am rarely inclined to take the time to write a review on Amazon but if I can persuade even one person to see this movie then it is time well spent. Do yourself a favor and see this movie. I genuinely found it moving. Moore is a true patriot and we all need to do our part to see our wonderful country continues to prosper for the betterment of everyone.
3,Meh~ not mike's best work,"He missed the mark on this film. not as good as 9/11, sicko or Columbine. not entertaining, not factual, expected better, fell asleep in it."
1,Cold War Documentary,"This ""documentary"" reminded me of Communist Russia's cold war anti-american documentaries.Don't even bother watching it on tv. Complete waste of time"
1,"Another Moore movie full of LIES, LIES and more LIES","Michael Moore doesn't mind making millions of dollars in a Capitalism economic system. If he hates Capitalism so much, then he should donate all his money to charity."
1,michael moore capitalism,bought that dvd from amazon; send 3 e mail telling them my dvd does not work and I am still waiting for an answer 2 months later. Thought amazon was a competent org but I have serious doubt in their ability to correct their problem. THe CD you send me does not f...work. COIuld you please read this message and correct it.
1,Another one for the sewage system to process,"Michael Moore wouldn't know the truth if it bit him in a**. Like his 9/11 film, he distorts facts and outright lies to make his points. Look on the Internet and search on 'Michael Moore lies'. You will find a number of site that totally dismantle Moore and his insulting films (insulting to one's intelligence).If he hates this country so much, why doesn't he move to Cuba? It has EVERYTHING that he loves.I am also amazed at the hypocrisy of Moore. How much money in this captitalist society has this socialist statist made on these movies? I would like to see him try the same thing in the former Soviet Union, North Korea, etc. The 'man' is a total hypocrite and delusional to the point that he has not a clue on how to tell the truth about anything.Ok, liberals, flame away with your deep felt hatred and name calling. I have heard and read it all with little thought to back up any of your rantings."
1,Wish I could rate it ZERO,Those drooling over Michael Moore are the same nitwits who would drool if Moore simply recorded a blade of grass growing.But I will give Moore this: He's the master of propaganda.
1,Uninformative,"I do not recommend spending money on this book. I am very concerned about Mad Cow Disease and BSE -- to the point where I only eat beef purchased from local farmers who guarantee that their cows have not eaten other animals. I was looking for a book that would give me more infomation on what governments are and aren't doing to protect people from this disease. Instead I got what can only be a fictional short story, and a very poorly written one at that. I think it was quite rude of the author not to specifically mention that his book is fiction, since its scoffingly unconvincing narrative might only serve to encourage skeptics to dismiss the possibility that goverments aren't doing all they should to protect their citizens from this disease."
5,Well Pleased,I was impressed with the promtness in receiving my order. The product was packaged in an appropriate manner to insure safe handling in the transport.
1,"Sung perfume, too bad it doesnt have a scent","You can smell this as your spraying it on, by the time you walk 10 feet you will have to reapply, although it would do no good-it doesnt last but 5 seconds, will stick to regular price and go the the store. Paid 26 bucks for a bottle of colored water"
2,DELLS,"I have purchased this item on four occasions, for personal use and two as gifts, I have been very happy with the product. However this time I received a defective item. The top of the bottle was in silver instead of the usual black and the sprayer does not work. Very disappointing! Inferior item! Just hope the two I gave as gifts worked!"
3,Not my kind of floral,"Oh, poopers. I was hoping for green.Well, Sung *is* green, just not *my* kind of green. Sung is bright, fresh, Spring green. Girlie-girl green. Wearing a frock made of frugly drapes and singing-Sound-of-Music-in-a-meadow green. Sung *is* THAT kind of green, which immediately disqualifies it as *my* kind of green.Sung opens *so* LOV that it's scary. It could be Coty's Mugeut de Bois. The LOV is enveloping and lovely, perhaps perfect if *your* kind of green is LOV. Mine isn't.Wow, the LOV just won't go away. I am sensitive to many white florals. Sung was asthma-inducing. Love you, Alfred Sung, but not your namesake perfume.The bottle has simple lines and is gorgeous. On the other hand, the black, plastic integrated spray on top ... not so much ... cheap & tacky.There are a few perfume critics who say 'women should not smell like flowers.' Sung is a bed of LOV. 'Nuf said."
1,Beware of discount price on this perfume!,"I was excited to get my favorite perfume at such a good price. When it arrived, I discovered why it was discounted. The perfume had gone bad. it had an awful ""off"" scent that sort of smelled sour. I contacted Amazon with the problem and they graciously sent me a new bottle. Well, same problem with the second bottle!! I even took the bottle to Nordstroms and had the salepeople smell my perfume compared to the sample bottle they had, and everyone clearly smelled the difference. Nordstroms said that perfumes definately do have a ""shelf life"" and can go bad. So, clearly Amazon is selling really old bottles for a discounted price. Terrible!"
3,Beware - TESTERS,"Great price, product was fine, but it was a tester. No packaging. This is OK, if it was made clear before ordering, it wasn't."
2,Alfred Sung - something off,"My perfume arrived without a box as well and there was clearly some sort of sticker on the bottle. (Perhaps a ""tester"" sticker.) The scent comes out of the bottle fine, but once it settles on my skin it smells like mold. I've used Sung for years so I don't think its an interaction with my skin. I thought it was such a great deal to find the perfume at this price but perhaps the oldness/the fact its a tester is the reason."
3,Lacking info.,"I love this fragrance, but was a little disappointed to find that I had been sent a tester. That part was not stated in the description of the product."
2,My favorite fragrance,"This was the 2nd bottle I've purchased from Amazon. Sung by Alfred Sung is my favorite fragrance of all times. However, was disappointed in my recent purchase. Never received any compliments like I've expereinced in the past."
3,does not last long,"It was a gift to me and when it delivered I don't know what was inside. When I opened the gift I found a perfume, and quickly I sprayed some on my body, but I didn't like this smell nor did my family. This scent does not last long."
5,The perfect introduction,"I wish I'd found this book when I was just starting. I'm an intermediate watercolor student who loves books on technique and buys them frequently. But even as someone who's been painting on and off for a few years, I delighted in finding Mr. Crawshaw's book at the library recently. It's chock-full of simple but useful demos--starting with a carton box, for instance--and progresses to fruits, vegetables, still lifes, animals, landscapes, people and water. The text is minimal and practical. Just last week I painted some fruits from his exercise and they were the best I've painted. An instructor teaching true beginners should at least know about this book, and beginners or even intermediate students looking for some simplified exercises from which to practice should try it. I may even add it to my collection."
4,"Lovely, passionate book","The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is about 5 to 10% of it is outdated. The rest is smart, funny, passionate and insightful, a joy for beginning and serious soccer fans alike. I read it in 3 days and now my girlfriend, a soccer novice, is consuming it with equal speed. I highly recommend it in full measure. (By the way: you can find out about Wrexham by going to espn.com/soccer, then going to ""Soccernet/UK"" and searching for club standings. They're still in the 2nd division, though close to relegation! )"
2,Fridge lock,The adhesive on the long side of the lock didn't stick AT ALL. My husband put a screw in it and it stays just fine. I wouldn't reccomend this product unless you don't mind putting a screw in your fridge.
2,Kind of small,Ordered this to replace my worn out cover. It looks nice enough but is very small in circumference. The older one covered much more of the steering wheel. This one was also very difficult to install as the diameter is also kind of small.
4,Sensual and Emotional Tale,"I became quite engrossed in this story. It weaves such beautiful elements of provincial life; the book is very sensual. The foods described can almost be smelled and tasted by the reader, and the beauty of the forest and the Loire river can be clearly visualized.As an old woman with many secrets, Framboise moves back to the village of her youth. She renovated her family's farm and cleans up the orchards on the land. She opens her restaraunt and become the talk of the town with her wonderful recipes. Yet, the secrets that she hides constantly stay on her mind... she recalls the summer when she was nine years old, the summer when her life changed forever.I felt the story line was quite complex, yet very readable and well-executed by Harris. This was my first book by her, and I was very impressed with the style and tone of her writing. A great pleasure to read."
4,I Highly Recommend,"Five Quarters of the OrangePast and present converge to tell the tale of love and life lost during the Second World War. Set in the Loire Valley of France, Joanne Harris has created a beautiful story that bring the characters to life and draws the reader in.Framboise Simon returns to the village of her childhood to reconstruct the way of life she lost during the war. Her only legacy from her long deceased mother is a scrapbook of recipes which on closer examination also holds the key to the truth of her past. Framboise is haunted by her memories as she grows closer to the truth that will ultimately set her free.Intrigue, suspense, love and hate are all rolled into this wonderful story. Truly a book I'd recommend to friends."
3,A child living in occupied France,"Interesting read - and good balance between the two stories: the present day and memories of the protagonist's childhood in occupied France. Story moves slowly - perhaps too slowly. Nonetheless, it is interesting and written in vivid detail."
3,"A bitter pill, beautifully written.","There are more than a few chilling features to this quick read. Harris does a superb job of creating the world of a backwater, literally, town and the isolated life of a French farm family with her rich description. Perhaps, that makes the consciencelessness (!) of the narrator's actions and reminisences all the more painful to read. I saw the two surprise elements of the ending coming about half way through. I confess I don't tend to care for first person narratives because if you don't care about the person doing the talking, what's the point? However, there is enough skill in the prose and if not redemption in the ""heroine"" then dare I say healing to make it worth one's time."
1,Dreary,"While a sentence here or a phrase there stand out as poetic, even lovely, this story is dark and joyless. A sick, cold-hearted mother, children who commit evil acts without remorse...tedious to the end."
2,Sadly Disappointing..........,"I enjoyed Chocolat and Blackberry Wine so much, I couldn't wait for the paperback of Five Quarters of the Orange to come out in June, so I went to the UK site and ordered it. I couldn't wait to receive it and get started. Sadly, I was disappointed. There really were no characters in this novel you really ""cared"" about. I found myself admiring 9 year old Framboise' grit, but just didn't ""care"" for her much. France itself seemed such a vital part of the novels, Chocolat and Blackberry Wine, yet this novel lacked the charm which appealed to me in those novels. I also bought Coastliners at the same time I ordered this one and I'm actually filled with more trepidation than excitement to begin reading it. I still enjoy Joanne Harris, and will continue to read her novels, but this was just not one I would recommend to my friends or choose to read again."
5,A Feast of Fiction,"This story switches back and forth between Framboise growing up with her siblings in occupied France during WWII and her life years later in her 60's, as a cafe owner with children and grandchildren of her own.Framboise is reminiscing of her complex childhood with her dysfunctional mother. I say dysfunctional because her mom had an illness. She claimed every time she smelled the scent of oranges, or had an orange around her, it would make her come down with these blinding headaches. She would have to go to bed for days on end sometimes and the kids would be left to their own devices. Frambiose goes on to tell then of their days growing up while her mom was debilitated, and often almost intolerable to live with.Later, after Frambiose's other dies, she leaves a scrapbook to Framboise written with a lot of recipes over the years, along with many of her mother's secrets.It was one of the most different books I have read, and overall I enjoyed the book."
2,Not at all my favorite.,"Honestly, when I started this book, I was so bored with it that I had to absolutely force myself to read it. That's possibly because I had to read it for school, but then again, I just couldn't find anything to connect to. I really just didn't care what was going on and nothing about the book quite captured my attention. I have read Chocolat and I loved it, but this book was very disappointing in comparison. I tried very hard, but I just couldn't make myself finish it. I couldn't become attached to any of the characters, and I just didn't like it. It could be alright for some people, but I just couldn't read it myself."
3,Bittersweet,"This was my least favorite of the Joanne Harris books I've read. The writing, as always, is lyrical and evocative, but the tale is hard and brittle. I'm the author of a book for mothers, NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL, and it is difficult for me to read about such a lack of maternal feeling. Much of the book gave me a chill."
2,Good Idea Falls Short,"I didn't finish this book. In the beginning it was enjoyable to hear other women's stories, but they all started to sound the same after a while. It was also disturbing to note that several of these women were on their second or third marriage."
2,Good but very basic,"This is a great DVD for people just starting Jiu Jitsu. Very old school, good moves, but if you are an intermediate blue and up it will look very redundant."
4,Refreshing change from the everyday mystery!,"This is the first book I have read from Robinson, and the only thing I regret is not finding this book sooner! This is an awesome novel by the extremely talented and humble Robinson. I must say, I truly enjoyed it for all it is worth. It is so deep, interesting, intelligant and inquesitive murder mystery. Never have I read a book that was so formally thought out. When you think you know who the killer is, there is always a twist and find myself questioning just how Peter Robinson will get himself put out of this theory, it alsmost seems impossible, but he always does. What guy. Pick up his books and read it people, honestly."
4,"Trusting evidence, not intuition, is tragic for Banks.","Trusting the evidence and not his own instinct has tragic repercussions in the latest Inspector Banks mystery from Peter Robinson. When a schoolgirl, the daughter of a well-connected, recently titled gentleman, is killed, the evidence points to a loner with no apparent alibi. Though he questions the findings intuitively, Banks does not go with his gut. The repercussions of this decision are felt as far away as London. Robinson insight on the media feeding frenzy surrounding crimes such as this are right on target. His view of the police, while sympathetic, is often acerbic as well. Another wonderful read"
3,"Interesting story, but disappointing ending","This was the first Inspector Banks novel that I have read. I will probably read others, as I enjoyed most of the book. However, I was somewhat disappointed by the ending. I thought it came on too fast, and wasn't developed nearly as much as the first 400+ pages of the novel."
3,Great for the beginner.,"The book is great for a beginning user of Pro/MECHANICA. I found the book to be very helpful since I am a new user of Pro/MECHANICA, but also found it to be somewhat limited. I know that Pro/MECHANICA has a lot of integrated features, but only the basics are mentioned in this book. Also, the book only covers structure analysis, and does not cover thermal or motion analysis."
3,WORKED GREAT,"Did a great job, although it took 3 treatments. That could be that all the nits were not found the first go around. As for the cost - when I have bought over the counter at retail stores, the expense was more than the LiceX. By the way after researching lice, they can only live up to 24 our without drinking blood."
2,What a disappointment,"This book was just awful. The characters were flat, the descriptions of women and their bodies (does anyone really call breasts ""jugs"" past junior high?) were cheesy, and the ending was cheap. The premise was a good one, but it was poorly executed."
3,An OK Read,"This book was fair - but he kept rambling on and on. I found it hard to keep up with him. It seemed to be ""Much Ado about Nothing""."
1,DISAPPOINTED!!! NOT GOOD!!!,"I bought this book thinking I would enjoy it, but boy was I wrong. This will be my last purchase by Edwardo Jackson. I did not enjoy the book at all. I could barely finish reading it. I hope the future books are better, but I won't ever find out."
2,No Good,"I've had this HP for a little over a year. It has given me so many problems. I finally gave up on it and bought a Canon Pixma. The HP is constantly jamming and giving me the message ""printer cartridge cradle cannot move."" The pages have never printed nicely from day one. Always very grainy. I worked with tech support to try and resolve the problem. They told me that it needed to be replaced, but they couldn't replace it without having a copy of the receipt (which I no longer had). Oh well... I do not recommend this thing to anyone!"
1,What a piece of junk......,"I hope HP reads this, The HPpsc1210 all-in-one is a terrible product. I have had it for 1yr, it doesn't print (only when it wants to), it jams, it's not good."
1,PSC1209 not scanning,This printer does not scan when you press the scan button. HP also does not make it easy to troubleshoot this.Don't bother buying it.
1,HP1209 = JUNK,"The FUNCTIONS of this printer/copier/scanner are AWESOME, but the QUALITY is absolute GARBAGE. For about the first 6 months, this printer would handle envelope printing reasonably well, but after that printing envelopes is essentially impossible. The printer usually destroys 3-4 envelopes before it gets one that is marginally acceptable. Additionally frustrating is that - like many HP printers - there is no reasonable way to extract paper jams. Also, the software that comes with the printer is NOT user-friendly. Finally, after recently re-installing Windows XP, the HP driver software (unnecessarily) re-installs the printer drivers EVERY time the computer boots up; sometimes it re-installs the printer drivers at random times. This is VERY FRUSTRATING."
2,Melted through the covering,"I used these to connect a 6 volt lantern battery to a kids light bulb experiment for some science camp activities and the wires got so hot that several of them melted right through the insulation.Other then that, the length was good, and the clips held firm."
3,"meh, they work but...","These are not the worst ever but not the best. The rubber over the clips slides off and moves around very easy, the wire is very small with a very cheap connection to the clip. I have also found they do not hold small wires well such as creating a test connection to a resistor or something with a similar diameter wire lead. If you are looking for a cheap wire set for casual use or testing these will work but if you need something for more serious use then proceed with cation"
1,These are horrible. Save your money.,These are of the poorest quality and should be avoided. Unless you plan to use them in an application that is temporary where quality doesn't matter in the least I recommend avoiding them. I don't trust them at all.
3,Fine for logic or other low load applicaitons,"I love having a 10-piece set of these. These jumpers are fine for logic/signal applications. The internal wire is probably 22 or 24 gauge with many strands so the leads are very flexible. They aren't suitable for any more significant load - the wire strip/crimp on the connector was, let's say, ""minimal"" so there's not much contact at the connection. Replaced the wire on a pair with a 18 gauge wire and now I have a heavy duty set too."
1,If the manufacturer wasn't already in a Chinese prison......,"These are the most pathetic excuse for jumpers I've ever seen. They look like something produced in a slave labor camp. The wire MIGHT be 28 ga. and isn't very well connected to the alligator clips. I only bought these to get my order over $25 so I could get free shipping. Since they have almost no value, that means I paid $3.67 for shipping. Could have been worse. At least I can salvage the alligator clips and MAKE MY OWN jumpers. If you need a good laugh, buy these."
2,"Ah, You Get What You Pay For!","These are a bargain, I guess, but I just HATE how the clip sleeves slip off and don't allow you to get a good grip. Then it's hard to get 'em back on when you get the idea to slide them off the clip. Errrgggh! But they are what they are. When you get some bucks, go for higher quality clips."
3,Don't always assume Amazon is cheaper!,"I purchased 2 sets of these and they work fine. However, I was at Harbor Freight over the weekend and saw the exact same set for $2.49 compared to $4.95 on Amazon. Just an FYI guys."
3,Extremely Light Weight,"Keep in mind the wire in these leads is very light weight, I don't know what the actual gauge is but I'm guessing 28 or 30 gauge. I accidentally shorted one on 12v and in .5 seconds it had melted the alligator clips off the wire. I would have expected to get a second or two, and just have a hot wire. I was able to repair it by re-crimping the clips on, but this showed me how light the wire was and I thought I would warn others."
3,Test leads,It did what I wanted for the project. It will also work for other electronic projects. I recommend it... Thank you. DJM.
4,jumpers.,"If you are an electrician you know what to do with these. I call them jumpers they call them test leads. I jumped things out, i guess they test things. lol Great deal for the price. I used to have them in every pocket when i worked now retired so i needed a few around the house. good product."
5,this is great,this is a must have equipment if u have a multimeter and u want to test circuit.highly recommend u
2,test leads,tried using theses leads they are meant for very low voltage and delicate work. most of them are broken in the trash. not what i had expected. the company shipped very fast and everything is ok there.
3,Thin wires.,"These have very thin wires. Obviously these are for temporary troubleshooting/testing purposes, but keep the circuit current in mind as these will heatup with only a couple of amps. Also, the thin wire may be a bit fragile down the road. Have you ever tried to troubleshoot something with a faulty jumper? - Very frustrating.I have not had any problems yet, but if you use these as I do (for industrial troubleshooting and testing), I want you to be aware of my concerns. There are better jumpers out there."
2,EHHHHHH,"BOUGHT THESE WIRES AND ONLY 4 OF THEM REALLY WORKED. THEY WERENT AS GOOD AS ALL THE OTHERS BUT THEY WERE SIMPLY, OK. DONT RECCOMEND THEM BUT IF YOUR DESPERATE GIVE IT A TRY"
1,test leads need doctor,These test leads were the worst.the clip part that you push is so small you slip on the vinyl cover and have to make a concertedeffort to open the clip .I would not recommend this product
1,junk,"don't buy unless you just want to fill yo tool box up.So little copper in wires,only use may be fusible link."
2,"Thin gauge wire, doesn't look very durable","These jumper clips have the thinnest wires I have ever seen, probably 24 or 26 AWG. The wires are so thin they feel like they might break internally or disconnect from the clip ends. I was hoping to toss these in a toolbox for frequent use but they would probably be damaged.If you are going to use these on a bench (for example with a breadboard) and always handle them carefully then they will be acceptable. For more real life use where they might experience rough handling I wouldn't recommend them. (FYI I ordered from Amazon)"
1,Not even close to 16 gauge,"The actual wire is super thin and no where near the 16 gauge that was advertised. That part of the description was an outright lie. The price should've given it away, but I trusted what they advertised."
2,These are far from the best...,"The test leads do work...most of the time...The product I received was rather low quality: the wire had 5 strands of VERY thin copper wires, and the end of the wire was stripped and haphazardly crimped into place by the simple alligator clip.I would advice making your own, or just buying some nice quality test leads...The last thing you want is assuming your project/device doesn't work, and it turn out to be these cheapy test leads."
1,"Very Poor Quality, Chinese Crap - Do not buy these","Items of EXREMELY poor quality; out of the bag, the alligator clips were not connected or pulled off leads. Some leads were not adequately crimped, some leads were open circuit, vinyl clip insulators slip off easily and are difficult to reinstall. I would not buy these items again."
1,wimpy,These test leads were way too wimpy for automotive use. Ifter a couple of them pulled apart then I just threw the rest of them out. Low grade product.
3,Very light gauge wire,"I guess for the price these are okay, but they are very light gauge wire - maybe 20 gauge or so. Clips are of good quality, and the colors are nice."
1,horrible,"yes, they are wire leads with alligator clips, so if that's your only standard for giving them a good rating...otherwise, trying to use these as jumper wires in electrical work is useless since they have so much resistance due to the very small gauge wire and shoddy connections. they make good clips for hanging paper, lol"
3,"Beautiful illustrations, but not much content","The authors have done an excellent job of converting old blueprints of aircraft that the German aircraft manufactures conceived but never built during the war into realistic artist's conceptions. Unfortunately, they largely fail to explain the details of why each design was a breakthough or a failure, and why they did not make it to production. That makes what could have been a facinating investigation into the aeronautical science of the day into little more than a good coffee table book."
3,"Good, Not Great","The research effort into the a/c themselves was extensive, careful, and critical, producing descriptions of, & data on, the a/c themselves that is excellent. Information provided on the revolutionary powerplants and armaments, which made these a/c fighter weapons, is much less detailed; nonexistent in the case of the weapons. By far, the book's greatest flaw is the amatuerish artwork. The colour drawings are on every page, and so poorly done that they detract from the book on every level. The ""art"" is awful. The cover painting is great, but that's it. Even the line drawings are amatuerish; art exhibits poor execution of perspective, and childlike ""pilots"" that are embarassing, while the line art is just sloppy. Were it not for the abysmal art, the book would get 4 stars from me. As it is, not worth the money unless you have a use for the technical info, and even then, it costs too much; had the art been better, it would have been worth the price."
4,Good read,"Easy to read, interesting concepts and likeable characters. Interesting ongoing exploration of the relationship between the two main protagonists. Overall a very entertaining series."
5,"God is one, however many","Maybe like Paul Simon and Adam you might eventually feel you 'think too much'. God, man and law on the brain. This changed my thinking about god. A lifetime of reflecting on Jesus, without much research, had me believing he was the product of the Abraham Moses prophetic tradition. This has me thinking otherwise.Rather than butcher, baker, messiah, this put you right back to the unknowable god we invoke for what help may be beyond us: healing might be the main thing. At many times in many places that meant casting out demons. Those times and places included the time and place of Jesus life and history.I would accept from this that the skills of a magician were learned much as others learned their trade.Jesus is quoted as attesting that he would have to be crucified and raised up.Can a carpenter be 'son of God'? Can a magician?"
5,Well Worth The Expense,"The Last Train Across Canada is an intriguing tale about Canada's last - and only - long distance train along with the author's various interesting side adventures, a well - spent 90 minutes."
2,Last Train Tape,I lent it to a someone to watch and he said it was old and parts of it were visually damaged. I knew the tape was old when I bought it and have learned a lesson about old tapes. Not blaming the seller for its age but he should watch old ones before selling.
5,Psychic Medium Karyn Reece's perspective on The Heart of Reiki CD,"By far one of my favorite CD's to listen to. Its smooth, relaxing and is wonderful for meditation."
2,Ordered the wrong CD,Ordered the wrong CD and was disappointed. It seemed like the entire CD kept replaying same song or chorus over and over. Merlin's Magic has some really nice recordings. The Healing Harmony CD is a wonderful CD. Actually going to order this for myself as it is now in CD format. Thanks Amazon.com.
5,The best Reike CD I have found!,"I purchased ""Heart OF Reike"" two years ago and it is, by far, the nicest one I have ever found! Everytime I play it for someone, they fall in love with it. The music brings you a place of calm and rejuvenation! The soothing tones transport you a plane that is enriching and healing. Whoever purchases it, will not be disappointed!"
2,Irritating Chimes,"Not bad, however during the whole cd there is piercing zylophone/chime being struck in the same melody. It is louder than the rest of the soothing music, and hits the same 6 notes over and over. At one point I suddenly got this feeling of relief and calm, then I realized they stopped the zylophone strikes.Don't listen to it with headphones. I'd reccomend it as blah background music for a quiet metaphysical lecture/talk. For meditation? Not if you want to relax and flow. I guess it would be okay for Reiki, but not too loud. Keep it low and just above barely audible.Thats my take."
1,Same notes over and over,The same notes were played in the background over and over. It was annoying. It overshadowed what was probably some really good music. I just couldn't focus on anything else but the notes in the background. I am returning it.
2,Very boring,"I am a Reiki master practitioner and have my own business and am always looking for complementary music for my sessions. This CD may be relaxing but it is not uplifting or ""energy-friendly"". To me, it seemed as if the producers of the CD didn't put any effort into creating it, and just wanted to get it into the energy market."
1,worthless unless you're a professional dancer,"I have been taking step classes for many many years, generally 2 - 3 times a week -- so I am not new to this. That said, this is one of the worst exercise videos I have ever seen (along with ""Step It Off 2"" by the same instructors). The instructors call the steps the first time through, then proceed to chatter perkily while they go through the routine again -- without saying what steps are coming up! Naturally, I am lost after the first few minutes. Even worse, they add on all sorts of jumps, turns, ""fancy dance moves"", and then proceed to not call those either. If you are a dancer, perhaps you will be able to follow these instructors, but I sure couldn't follow them. A complete waste of money."
4,MY GRADE: B,"Spiderman shows up to complain about a movie being made about him with a nod towards the Raimi/McGuire picture. It just gets worse for him in the usual tradition when Doctor Octopus shows up.The resolution with Gwen Stacy felt off but the moviemaking inside jokes was amusing.Some good action scenes with Spidey and Octo. Other characters were mostly same old, same old but that's okay if you enjoy the repeat style characters as I do.Written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrations by Mark Bagley with inks by Art Thibert and Scott Hanna.ARTWORK PRESENTATION: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus to B; ACTION SCENES: B to B plus; WHEN READ: end of December 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B."
3,Spider-Man meets Tobey MacGuire,There is a lot of tongue-in-cheek between Ultimate Spider-Man and Tobey MacGuire Spider-Man. Ox gets a part in the movie. But the main fight is between Spidey and Doc Ock.
3,Paper Cover Book,"I ordered a paper cover version of this book, simply for the reason that the price is $20 lower than hard cover one. However, most figures in the book is black and white, which is not good. I want to see the colored figures, especially for FISH images. The book is also on Google Book shelf with limited review.Next time I will choose hard cover version to ensure I get colored figures."
1,The largest atrocities in WWII?,"The Russian's atrocities are no less severe. Peiper is prosecuted only because he is with the defeated side. As a professional soldier, he has done what he should do only."
1,Learn from Great Teacher,"I have not received this book yet! At this point, I would rather CANCEL this order! I am very disappointed."
3,"Interesting Study, But Use Caution","As someone who works in a church, I have studied many books on religion. If you follow my reviews, you know that I am Anglo Catholic. As a scholar though, I don't mind reading about other faiths. This book was given to me by a Jehovah Witness who tried to convert me. I read the book, and needless to say, I am still Anglo Catholic.Jehovah Witnesses are commonly hated. (Probably because they go from door to door.) But the truth is that for some people, this religion does work.This book is basically a simplified New Testament from the Jehovah Witness point of view. So, unless you are a Jehovah Witness, or want to become one, I do not suggest this as your source. But it is an interesting tool if you want to see how Jehovah Witnesses think, and how they support their beliefs.Granted, most of us probably don't want to take on their beliefs. But that is no reason to hate Jehovah Witnesses. I think we have to understand that different religions work for different people."
1,This book is a free publication!,I just wanted to add that this is a free book left by Jehovah's Witnesses.
4,great book...took a little long to get here,The content of the book is great and we are glad to have it. We just feel that it took a little long to arrive. Usually we receive items quicker.
3,Misrepresentation on Warranty,"Didn't actually purchase the B70. I wanted to do my research first. The lifetime warranty on parts seemed too good to be true so I contacted the manufacturer. According to the manufacturer, the warranty on parts is 5 years. Frame is lifetime and labor is 1 year. I just wanted everyone to be aware of this fact."
5,Insider's Guide to Media,"Ever wondered about the meaning of terms listed at the end of a movie? (It's called a ""crawl"".) Here's a book that, for the first time, explains it all. I found it indispensable for understanding the various terms involved not only in tv, but media in general. Weiner has provided an easy-to-read, interesting compilation of these terms, written in an engaging personal style. More than a straight-laced dictionary, it gives you insight into newspapers (see the entry of the Los Angeles Times), public relations (see marcom), politics (see Beltway), tv and motion pictures (see Lucille Ball), football (see John Madden), comics (see Borscht Belt) and thousands more. All in all, a fascinating look into the insider's world of communications. I can not recommend it more highly."
4,Dealing With Loss!,"It is difficult to imagine how someone can get over the loss of a loved one. Some remember the good times to help cheer themselves up; some bury themselves in their work to try and forget about the pain; some simply grieve. Alita on the other hand decides to enter the most deadly sport ever devised!Not only in a bid to numb the pain of her loss, but also to try and unlock some of the secrets of her past Alita leaves her old life with Ido behind and becomes a compettitor in a deadly race in which 13 people fight it out to be the first to cross the finish line with the Motorball (and hopefully all of their limbs).The third book in the Alita series lacks alot of the depth of its predecessors, but it is still packed full of action, thrills and beautifull illustration. And don't worry, the lack of depth is made up for in the conclusion of this TWO PART volume (Angel of Victory) making this a splendid addition to the series."
5,Full of Excitement,"After the deah of her love, Hugo, Alita decides to leave the Scrapyard and Ido behind her. Of course Ido cannot live with out his ""daughter"", and sets out to find her. He finds himself saving a girl named Shumira. Shumira in turn, helps him find Alita. Alita is now in a type of game that involves battling others, which is what she lives for. Alita seems to be at home and Ido gets jealous. He wants to bring Alita home, but doesn't know how."
2,This is sooooo drawn-out!,"This is one book out of a two-book-long sports story about a screwed up game where people get killed for no apparent reason other than as an excuse to show blood-n-guts scenes. Alita behaves illogically, there doesn't seem to be a point to anything, and when it's all over after the second book nothing seems to have happened. A big waste of whatever goes into it."
5,Bulgur - as coarse as you'd like,"Most places don't carry bulgur at all, or if they do it's too fine (#1 or #2), but Arisa has #4 which is a coarse and hearty grind.The product is exactly as described, fresh and delivered without delay.Excellent service -- I will order from them again.-Dave"
5,"So Calming, Relaxation to the Max","A couple of days ago i went for a total body massage. The massage was wonderful, but the music playing was just so beautiful, and definately contributed to the relaxation of my body and mind. When the massage was over, the first thing i said was ""What was the name of that cd you had playing""?"
2,repetitive,I bought this CD totally on the basis of all the positive reviews and I am disappointed. Yes it is gentle but I feel it hasn't got enough substance to it. In fact I found it to be repetitive in an annoying way. I want music to move me and this doesn't. It's okay for some light background music that you're not paying much attention to.
5,You won't be dissapointed,"THE best relaxation cd ever!! I purchased it several years ago and have never gotten tired of it. It is smooth, serene and flawless."
5,Perfect relaxation music,"This is perfect to listen to when trying to fall asleep after a long, chaotic day or to have as background music at work. Highly recommended."
5,Very Healing,"This album/track has been very helpful to me. It's something that always lifts my mood and energy, and clears my energy body, thus making it easier to concentrate on my tasks."
5,Etheric Journey,"Of all Merlin's Magic C.D.'s this one, ""The Light Touch"" is simply the best. I can listen to this over and over again and never tire of hearing it. It will transport you to a level of conciousness that is perfect for meditation or Reiki. If you are an insomniac, this is really much better than any pill they have on the market. Andreas Mock is truly a genius. This CD is very spiritual and I can think of no other that I like as much as I like and ""love"" this one. Do yourself a favor and buy it."
3,Misleading name,"I bought this item because I was led to believe that the bees had collected lavender nectar for the honey, only to discover the following on the product label:Ingridients: USDA Grade A honey, Lavender Essential oil.Meaning this honey could have been collected anywhere, while the lavender taste was generated by mixing lavendar essential oil into the it. Not quite what I had in mind."
2,Lavender Honey,"I was surprised how much I dislike the flavor of lavender honey. The lavender smells lovely but adds a bitter, acrid, unpleasant taste.Lavender Honey"
4,Great NPC Supplement for basic D&D,"This was one of my favorite books as a teenager. The write ups are for basic Dungeons and Dragons but can be used for hackmaster, D20,Castles and crusades and really any fantasy game. One page has a detailed drawing by Jim Holloway of about twenty or so characters numbered, on the following pages are descriptions of the npc's and their stats. The groups are classes for basic D&D, elves, halflings, dwarves, fighters, thieves, clerics, mages, ect. In the back of the book describes an inn (The classic meeting place) and the back of the module is the tavern map perfect for minis."
4,I like it,"It was a bit larger than what I needed, but it serves the purpose. In general i like it.It is a great tool for storage and transport of my meds."
2,Freaky phone,"This phone is very freaky. It will not dial a number every time or it will dial part of a number that is dialed. I was dialing my aunt and got the first number and last two numbers, which happened to be the 911 operator. I was not the only one to have that happen to with this phone. My aunt and mother also had the same thing happen. It was embarrassing to explain to the 911 operator. It frequently says ""Please hang up and dial again"" and it is very frustrating when dialing a long 1-800 number."
1,Noisy line and very fine print,"I purchased one of these as a Christmas gift and it was a lemon. The unit was defective and kept inserting noise into the line. AT&T; tech support went through the same easy steps as the manual, then told me to return it.Also, the intent was to have two handsets that could be used simultaneously, but this unit DOES NOT do that. You can only use one at a time, a fact that is only made clear in the very fine print in the users manual. The box (and the product description on Amazon.com) seem to imply that both handsets can be used at once. You can only transfer calls from one to the other. This may work for you, but my gift recipient wanted to have two people on the line at the same time."
2,fireeck,Lots of features but handset voice pickup creates an echo. Any ambient room sound is picked up by the mike making conversations difficult. Would not recommend this phone.
4,Works great,I have not utilized all the features for my phone but it is a good fit for me so far. The reception is good for a cordless phone and it seems to do fine at a distance. I had a reception problem with the phone I replaced with this one. I like that the buttons are prominent and easy to read. I especially like the speakerphone feature. It is very clear and is helpful at times. This phone is a good buy.
5,Much better than I was hoping for!,"Obviously, from the perspective of the price point I wasn't sure exactly what I was going to get, but based on reviews I went for it. I am so glad I did, these turned out to be far more clear than I had hoped for. Don't get me wrong, these are not intended to be audiophile internal speakers, but for external, all weather, speakers these things are impressive. I have been using them for 3 weekends now I each time I am still impressed. They have a sturdy build and I am sure they will last for years (and even if they didn't, I would purchase these again in a heart beat."
4,Good speakers,"These speakers were easy to install in the ceiling of my patio. They have binding post and banana plug connectors, which are better than the spring loaded connectors of the speakers they replaced. The mid and high frequencies are good, and the bass frequencies are ok for this size speaker. The price was good too."
5,Great for the patio,"I installed the set of dual speakers under my patio and wired them to channel ""B"" of my amplifier in the house. They are great to entertain guests or just listen too on the lounge chair."
1,Not what I expected,"Maybe I missed something and it was my fault I ordered this.I have been to Japan and I have many Chinese friends and they all love these Hi-chew. They got me addicted to it; so when I went to Japan I was in heaven. The Japanese version is far superior to the American version.I ordered these seeing the picture and thinking it was actually the Japanese version. When I received them, it was a box of the ones I could easily get at Blockbuster (or Walmart now sells them for WAYYYYY less money).Needless to say I did not get what I was expecting AT ALL. They were ""safe"" and they tasted good as any Hi-chew does, but I was expecting the Japanese version since that is what the picture illustrated.I won't order these again. If I want the lesser American version I will get twice as many for less the price."
2,Not The Japanese Version,"I ordered these thinking I was getting the Japanese version of the candy. Instead item arrived with the American packaging. I can buy the crappy american version at my local Asian market. The taste, texture and packaging of the Japanese version of the candy is much better.I would not have bought these if I had known it was not the Japanese version like in the picture."
1,Don't Buy!!!,This game continually froze. It was slow and there were many things about it that could have been better had they not rushed to get it out in time for the holiday shopping season.
1,do not buy this,this makes absolutely no sense. Do not wast time or money on this product. I felt guilt owning it so I had to throw it in the trash so others would not be subjected to it's uselessness.
1,"DON""T BUY THIS GAME SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!","My twin girls and I watch Deal or No Deal all the time and we thought this would be a fun DVD game....BOY WERE WE WRONG!!!! In the two player mode....it is so slow that the waiting playing is just sitting there watching you pick a case...not much fun...no action. You have to pick the case with the up & down arrow key on your remote and thats the only interaction you have in this game.....Don't waste you money....also I TRIED TO RETURN THE GAME AFTER having it for 2 DAYS TO WAL-MART....THEY WON""T TAKE IT BACK DUE TO COPYRIGHT LAWS IF IT HAS BEEN PLAYED."
1,Deal Or No Deal? - BAD DEAL!!!!,"AVOID!My wife is a big fan of the show. I purchased the game (about $20 at Wal-Mart) as a Christmas gift for her and we tried it last night (Christmas Day). Experienced the same problem as numerous others - game froze. I actually had to unplug my DVD player to reset the machine in order to remove the DVD! For the brief time it did work, choosing the case number you wanted was a long and arduous task. This game is not worth the value of the lowest priced case!"
1,Slow and dull,"This game is a snore. In selecting cases to be eliminated, you are shown a screen with one numbered case and you get to scroll through them one at a time (and it takes forever!!!) No need to play this game more than once. If you bought one as a Christmas present, return it before you open the shrink-wrap!! I wish I could give it 0 stars, instead of 1."
5,Give the game a break for what its worth guys!,"For those who have panned this interactive DVD I say... ""Give the software a break for what its worth""... Technology has come a long ways, but of course we can expect a lag or two when it comes to a DVD game like this... Yes, Howie could have said; ""Open the case please"" and yes, the model could have been someone else for variety and a more sense of reality but otherwise I think the game responds remarkably fast considering all the options it has to change to once the player makes their choice... I've played it twice since getting it today and love it... Deal or No Deal? I say ""Deal""!!!"
1,This is a terrible game!,"I caould not get this to work on our DVD player. It just stopped working and showed a green screen. Then I could not get the DVD player to respond to turn it off! It took several times of turning the DVD player on and off to get it to release the DVD. I then tried it on our XP computer. I got it to at least play the game....for a while. Then when picking cases, it would only let me pick cases up to 13. Then it just got stuck on pick a case. What a piece of crap!! My husband is returning it as I am typing this review. Save your money!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this game for my nephew for Christmas. The game froze up and kicked them out when the banker was to make an offer. I had read the reviews before I bought, but he wanted it so bad I was hoping I would luck out and get a ""good"" one. Until they get this game fixed, heed the warnings in the reviews. DON'T DO IT!!"
1,don't buy this product,"i bought two. one stuck right at the end of the game, and the other was worse. i gave it as a Xmas gift, and when she unwrapped the DVD package inside the box, there was no DVD!Unbelievable"
2,Deal or No Deal.....ummm No Deal!,Seemed like it would be a fun game....turns out it's really slow and really quite boring. Playing the game at home really shows how important those overacted moments of suspense on the television show are. Without them you're just picking random numbers and the decision of making a deal or not isn't as much fun when you have nothing to lose.
1,BORING,"We thought the game was so slow paced and BORING. Nothing like the TV show. We didn't even finish playing. If I could return it, I would"
3,Freeze or No Freeze,"We actually enjoy the game when it is not freezing up in the middle of our game. Scrolling through the cases can also be tedious at times. The game was probably rushed quickly to sell at stores, and gliches not worked out. The game is fun, it just can be a pain sometimes."
1,Deal or No Deal DVD game,"This game is terrible. It freezes, it glitches, and it gives DVD games a bad name. It has no sense of flow of the tv game. It is nice to see the models, though, but it is the same shot over and over. Not a good game."
1,Deal or No Deal DVD Game,Do not buy this game it does not work.It locks up in the 6th round. Bad Bad Bad
3,Nothing special,The computer game version has a total different feeling than the game on TV. I was bored the computer game after playing it just one time!
3,"Not as bad as all that, but not as fun either.","The main problem with this game is simply that it is slow and tedious. Yes, it captures all the style of the TV show. But it's missing any sense of suspense or flow. You have to scroll through the cases to get to the one you want to choose. Then you have to wait for load time. Then you make your choice. And wait for load time.The inherent flaw in home versions of TV game shows is that you'll never win anything. But this game makes you feel like you've lost even more."
1,No Deal,"I received this game as a gift. Previously, I had thought about purchasing it, but opted out because I had read comments about it before. Sooo, when I got it as a gift I thought, What do I have to lose? I attempted to play it in one DVD player. As soon as it got to the menu part, the darn thing just shut off! After trying this several times, I decided to try it in another DVD player, a newer one, and found that I could make it to the menu, but I couldn't scroll through the cases! I am so disappointed that I never got to actually play the game! I also feel bad for the person who bought it for me because they knew how much I enjoy the show and was trying to make me happy. It is called DEAL OR NO DEAL, and I got the NO DEAL. Anyway, I would highly recommend not buying this game. I think I am going to stick to board games for awhile."
3,OK but it has a few issues,"I've had problems playing this game on my PC DVD and my home DVD (Ex: I'd select case #5 but # 8 would open up because the game couldn't keep up with the pressing of the up and down arrow keys). Since you have to use the remote arrow keys to page up and down case by case before you pick the one, it can take quite a long time to play this game. The clips of Howie and game play are pretty good though - so I'd say overall it's a average game."
2,Disappointed with Design,"Although this is an interactive DVD game, the response time using the remote control is terrible. I have tested this on several different DVD players. It gets slightly better on some, but overall, it is still slow. The reality in comparison to the TV show is greatly lacking. This game does not let you view all the remaining case numbers at one glance. You have to scroll number by number to see what is left to eliminate. In addition the listing of remaining amounts in play only shows up when you are asked deal or no deal. Leaving you trying to remember what amounts are still in play and effecting the overall strategy. I do not recommend this game."
1,Don't buy this game,This version of Deal or No Deal is agonizing slow. Also there isn't a board that show you which cases you have already open and the money board is only visible after you pick all your cases and only for a few seconds. I was very disaapointed and won't recommend this version of the game to anyone.
5,"very fun, whole family plays","My whole family plays this game, including our 4 & 5 year olds. We love it and can play it over and over and never tire of it."
2,A Disappointing Purchase,"I'm very glad that I bought this game on sale for $5. While ""Deal or No Deal"" is, in itself, very amusing, players can't even enjoy it in this format because the way it's set up is so poor. The gameplay is very slow; at first I thought it was just my DVD player, but when I used it with the PS2, I ran into the same problem. When you choose which cases you'd like to eliminate, you have to scroll through every case number to get to the one you want, which wouldn't be so bad, except that scanning through them takes a LONG time, and you have to press the buttons over and over again to get the disc to respond. Also, for those of you who really like the women holding the cases, the same one's profile is shown over and over again in the game: no variety. Overall this game is really not worth purchasing. You almost want to make any deal that the banker offers just to be able to stop playing..."
1,sssssllllooooowwwwww,"This game is the slowest piece of junk i've ever experienced in my life. I got this game and played it on my 26th birthday, I thought I wouldnt finish till my 27th birthday. It freezes up, it takes FOREVER to choose a suitcase, and there are no visuals of the board with the dollar amounts during game play. A new and improved game should definitely be developed. I find the free online game to be better than the dvd edition."
2,Avoid!,"My husband is a big fan of the show. I purchased the game (about $20 at Wal-Mart) as a Christmas gift for him. Experienced the same problem as numerous others - game froze. I actually had to unplug my DVD player to reset the machine in order to remove the DVD! For the brief time it did work, choosing the case number you wanted was a long and boring task."
1,NO DEAL for Deal or No Deal DVD Game,"Save your money! The game had the potential to be very entertaining but falls far short. First, you have to find a DVD player that will work with the multitude of glitches that occur during the game. Then you have to suffer through the frustrations of having the game constantly FREEZE or if you don't click fast enough the game will start over. Choosing the briefcases is extremely slow and you spend most of the game clicking through an UP or DOWN arrow to chose your case. Very boring!"
3,Not the Real Deal...,"This version of the ""Deal or No Deal"" television game moves very slowly. On the real show (as well as their online version) you can see ALL of the remaining cases from which to choose...this DVD version only shows 4 cases at a time and you must scroll through 7 screens to view them all. This makes for a LOOOOOONNNNNNG game.They do use the real ""Howie"" (no cartoons) however, there is only a view of a girl's hands opening each case and it's obviously the same girl.Howie's comments are basically the same so, they become very repetitive after you've played the game once or twice.In trying to make the DVD approximate the ""real"" experience...they have only succeeded in making it very tedious. You end up wanting to MOVE ON to the results.The improvement over the real game is that you can have more than one player...each alternating choices - trying to end up with a better outcome."
2,Love the show but game moves too slow,The process of scrolling to choose case numbers was very slow and we quickly lost interest.
5,Deal or No Deal DVD Game,"I love this game!!!!! I enjoy the show so much & decided afterwards to buy the game. It is extremly entertaining & easy to play even with 1 player. I enjoy the fact that the game is mind boggling. It is exciting & fun to try and find that 1 million. I would say that this game is appropiate for all age groups (both children & adults). The younger children might have difficulty following along, but for the most part it is easy to play & understand. The game is played for the most part by DVD. There is very little writing to do. The only writing that there is to do is when your trying to keep track of the cases & money offers. It would have been nice if there were dry eraser boards to use instead of paper. In the long run it would also be more cost effective especially if you play it as much as I do."
2,Great idea---just incredibly slow,"Not much more to offer here other than to chime in with everyone else. Beware this game is VERY slow. Scrolling through the cases for the one you want to select is a true beating. My wife and I play this with our 6 and 7 year olds, and it gets to the point where we just pick the ""next"" case as we cannot stand to wait how long it takes to navigate among the cases. If it were fast (or even ""not slow"") it would be very entertaining."
1,Worst DVD Game Ever!!!!!,Dont believe any of the comments saying that this game is good. It has a ton of bugs and I have never been able to finish an entire game. This game SUCKS!!!! Its terrible dont ever buy it.
1,Not a good DVD game.....No deal!,"This game is BORING. No strategy, no drama, no reason to play. Not very well done either."
5,He Loved it!,Bought this for a friend of mine to give to her boyfriend. He loved it!Thanks for the Fast shipping!
1,I hate this book.,"Actually, I decided that this book is no longer a beneficial part of the associated class, and I am no longer going to be reading it! The tiny print and dense nature of the book make it physically hard to read. Furthermore, the authors are uber-liberal. I am waiting for the authors to start praising the ways of communism, considering they have so far opposed any sort of public program, gov't or otherwise, that uses any sort of tiered or graduated eligibility system. The authors seem to have a very narrow view of what type of Community Practice is best. My only problem now is that I can't sell it back before the semester ends."
4,An Excellent Auditing Tool,One of the best ways to ensure that your business continuity program is addressing your business needs is to conduct an audit. This book provides excellent insights and guidance on the issues associated with auditing business continuity. It helps you through the audit process so you can ensure that your plans are properly organized. Why wait until you are formally audited?
4,Great Gift,"I got this for my dad because he loves to grill. It's great because you can flip all of the kabobs in one easy turn and the non stick makes cleanup a breeze. The only drawback is that if you like to put all of your veggies on one stick, meat on another, etc. because of the different cooking times, it can be a bit of a fuss."
5,Easy install without drilling holes,Westin's mounting kit is easy to use. Uses factory holes and solid. Just make sure you order the correct kit for your truck. I suggest you verify on the Westin web site.
3,No Standard Shipping to Alaska,There is no Standard Shipping to Alaska. $16.75 in shipping for a $16.95 pair of pants! I don't think so... You've just lost my business.
1,terrible,Amazon sent me a TV that did not even work out of the boxterrible service and there was no refund
3,"Huge and great, except for heavy items.","I purchased 2 of the duffels to move my climbing and backpacking equipments during a move across country.When I filled it with equipment, I grapped the handle and it started to tear. So I had to move it by holding it in a bear hug.If you're going to be moving light weight equipment, this bag is great. If you're moving heavy items, purchase a higher quality duffel."
4,Soft sheets!,"These sheets are so soft, made of jersey fabric. They are a little big for my cosco play yard, but they're overall good, especially for the price!"
5,pak and play sheet,The ordering was simple the shipping was on time and the product was exactly what the new mother wanted. It fits perfectly and will have more to say after the boy arrives.
4,Best Spring-Powered Desert Eagle,This thing is awesome. It can shoot like 70ft at best. Great for wars. 290 fps. Very accurate. I bought mine in sports authority for [...] the clear one is [...] so you save some money buying it online. The orange tip looks kind of wierd. Painting over it would look cool but it tells you not to on the box. Great gun.
4,Review of fine book for people who like boats.,"If you love the waterfront, the look of a fine vessel, the feel of freedom with a boat under you, you will love this book. Ms. Scott's poetry evokes the feel of the situation, the sense of the person portrayed, the reality of the environment. Along with the superb illustrations by her late husband, David Scott, the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. A delightful read, and a wonderful re-read, savoring the poetry AND the pictures."
4,Boyfriend problems,"Dex was devastated when Joanna broke up with him. Then he died. Joanna doesn't take it too hard, boys are just toys to her. Then Dex returns from the dead...Another great read from Stine with a nice twist to its ending"
5,Good,"This was the first R. L. Stine book I ever read after the Goosebumps books. The plot was interesting, and the high-school-age characters are a little more realistic than the ones in some of his other teenage-audience books."
2,Not his best work...,"Stine is a great YA author, but this book really sucks. He's written so many good books, I feel like this was just a rush job he slipped in and they published it because of who he was. The main character Joanna, is a real snob who treats people really bad. She has a boyfriend and he dies and then it appears he haunting her. I know a lot of his books are far fetched, but this one is way too unbelievable. Also, Joanna is so unlikable that readers will be wishing for her death, not wanting her to solve any mysteries. Don't waste your time or money on this stinker."
2,Dex is alive or not?,Unlike most of R.L Stines books this one was my least favorite of them all. This book takes place at Midwood highschool and a girl named joanna wants to break up with her boyfriend but before she as the chance he boyfriend falls off a cliff and dies or is alive i dont know which one because he keeps on dyeing that by the end of the book you dont really care if he is dead or alive.The major charters are joanna and dex the boy who dies. the problem in the story is that before she has the chance to break up with him and then he dies but he comes back from the dead for one last date and finds out that she wants to break up with him and tryes to kill her.The novel is fiction.
2,The Review of the book the boyfriend by R.L Stine,This book is a very good but it had me baffeled at the begining. Like most of R.L Stines books they keep you guessing throught the whole book and make you want to keep on reading it until you find out whats goning to happen next this book was not the same. Dex kept on dying that by the time i got to the end of the book i didint really care to know if he was dead or alive. Unlike most of Stines books the main character is nice and sweet but in this case joanna is a mean and self conserened person that in the end it makes you think do you want her alive or not.Out of all the books that he has written this was my least favorite.
4,A Bad Relationship (Blanca),"""The Boyfriend"" was a good book to read because it teaches a very important lesson. Joanna the main character was a pretty girl who had everything that a girl could want. But her best friend Mary wanted Joanna to experience somehting that she hasn't experienced. Since Joanna treated Dex bad she was the one who suffered the consequences at the end. What goes around comes around. She realized the truth at the end. She had it all but didn't have love. People need to be kind to everyone you shouldn't try to show off or it could end up with something very bad, just like this book did."
5,It was weird!,"The Boyfriend was the book I read. It wasn't like any other book that I've read before. This book was a page turner. I finished the book in nine days. That's the quickest I've ever read a book. I would recommend this book to people that like page turners and scary books, but also don't mind it being a little gruesome. It was really exciting.I liked the book a lot. I started it and the next thing I knew I was finished. The setting changes because Joanne and one of her boyfriends, Shep, lived in a rich neighborhood, and her other boyfriend, Dex, and her best friend, Mary, live in kind of poor neighborhood. In the story, Joanne is dating this guy Dex, and he was messing around on a cliff and fakes a death. He was trying to get back at Joanne by coming back from the dead. Then Joanne started to cheat on Dex with Shep. The ending was sort of weird, but you have to read the book to find out for yourself."
2,Not great for Wii interactive whiteboard,"I purchased this ir led pen to use with a Wii interactive whiteboard. The pen was picked up by the remote but the design makes it impossible to use as an input device for an interactive whiteboard. I am sure it works great for the intended use, but does not work well for my intended use."
5,Great Educational Resource Material!,This product was used for my classroom educational environmental class. It works well and still in use to this day.
2,Whoaaa!,"I have been working out for 20 years, doing cardio, weight lifting, stepping, kickboxing, pretty much everything. Although I really like Tracy and Michelle's other videos, the pace of this one is just too fast. They are doing so many different things on the stepper, and it's too hard to keep up.I felt I spent most of the time trying to figure out what the heck they were doing. I know sometimes it just takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but this one was ridiculous.I liked the weight lifting part of it, at least I felt I got a workout from that. The movements on the stepper are just too complicated and there are too many of them incorporated into the workout. I was very disappointed."
3,Bear's the best,Bear is definitely the best at reviewing colleges- straight forward facts that I wanted to know without a whole slew of boring information I could care less about. The common layman style writing made it easy to read and not so stuffy boring like some research books.I was looking for good information on degrees based upon life experience. The chapter in this book shoots down every school and doesn't list any quality schools. That's my prob. The reason I got the book. I know Obama spoke about it several times. I know there are some quality schools that offer it but which schools are they?So I should be annoyed it didn't have what I wanted but it was so obviously a great quality book I read it anyway. There's a selling point quote that I agree with- students shouldn't enroll without reading this book first.
5,Siku toys,"While a little on the pricey side, we have found Siku die cast toys to be the most durable and longest lasting of all the die cast brands, and I think well worth the extra cost. Parts do not fall off when played with, as they do with toys made by the company that makes the green farm and digger toys. They are also very nicely designed and incredibly life-like. These Siku construction toys do not easily break, unless dropped onto a hard floor from four or more feet high (longer than the child is tall); nothing beats them and you cannot go wrong purchasing these toys."
4,As honest as it gets,"The pleasant surprise of this book is that the authors, despite the title, didn't just stick to the career and decisions of Vince McMahon. They went through the history of professional wrestling as we know it and took a hard look at the other two major leagues, the AWA and the NWA/WCW and showed that whatever problems are inherit in pro wrestling, they weren't all invented by Vince McMahon. And they showed that even if Vince left the industry tomorrow, there would still be problems.To that end, I'm a bit disappointed that the authors didn't take a close look at World Class Chanpionship Wrestling, where the misadvantures of the Von Erich family made the WWF's seediest side seem tame by comparison, nor did we get a look at why ECW, which was a strong, promising and exciting product, fell apart.All in all, a good read that shows that blame is a lot like creamed spinach in the lunchline: plenty to go around, but no one wants to take their share."
2,Facts wrong.,"This book is well written, but not a lot of research was done. It's written like fiction. Andre the Giant did not retire in 1987, as this book states. He won the world title in 88, and the tag titles in 1990.Sloppy facts and enough made up info and verbiage make this book a no go."
2,Title is misleading,"This is billed as, ""The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation"", but this book is REALLY about the hisotry of the television development of the WWF, WCW, and NWA. The book is primarliy about how wrestling gained exposure through cable television and how the WWF and WCW eventually became giants through television and how WCW ""overtook"" the WWF in the ratings, and then going back to second fiddle to their eventual demise.It's fairly easy reading. I finished this in two days."
3,Ok nothing special,"Very similiar to many blue rays out to purchase (rise and fall of wcw, Monday night wars, history of Wrestlemania). Didn't learn much that I already did not know."
3,"OK book, but...","The book was ok in telling about the WWF(and also some about WCW, NWA, the Crocketts, Bill Watts, etc), however I did not get a lot of new information out of this book. Still, for those who are not familiar with the ""Monday Night Wrestling"" wars of the 1990's, the book is worth reading to get more background info."
2,bland,"This book doesn't teach you anything new except for how the wrestlers react to the deaths that have taken place in the business while they are trying to perform. I also learned a little about the XFL and USA network. Everything else is flat out repetitive. A whole chapter is dedicated the NWO, a lot of redundant info on Brett Hart, steroid, NWA, and Hulk Hogan that any educated wrestling fan knows. I could have read 200 plus pages of a wrestlers biography put out by the wwe and got more in depth information about the business."
1,Wrestling Witch Hunt,"I bought this book at a outlet mall, since it was on sale for very cheap. The writers, for whatever reasons, seem to have a personal grudge against Vince, and pro wrestling in general. Like it or not Vince is the reason why pro wrestling is what it is today. No Vince did not invent pro wrestling, he did not invent pay per view. He is the reason why the sport and pay per view are what they are today."
4,Entertaining read,"A very nice overview of the wrestling business in the 20th century. Not on a level with Foley's first book, but still very informative, especially when concerned with the McMahon family's business strategies. The last 20 pages felt rushed, but I guess the author felt he needed to conclude with the WCW collapse and buyout. Recommended."
3,Good information but not nothing new,"I think we all know why vince bought WCW right? Well the author tells us why vince bought WCW in a whole chapter with nothing we havent heard, ""Vince wanted to cut WCW's throat and buy his competition"". Uh duh? The book was kinda funny at times about how vince tried to lie about steriods and Hulk even wanted to help him but when you get led into one scandel the book takes the reader to the information a little bit, then goes to what the author thinks.Well I think the book is interesting for light readers and non WWE fans, not WWE fan who know wrestling good.I recommend you buy this if you dont know about the 14 odd scandels vince was invloved in and wanna know."
3,Decent,"This book wasn't too shabby. I expected more on Vince himself and his creation of a new standard in professional wrestling, but there was a lot more, especially WCW. For a book with Vince on the cover and about the WWE, there was a whole lot on the nWo and the politics between Hogan, Nash, Russo, etc."
2,Disappointing to say the least!,"Despite giving some insight into the early days of pro-wrestling and some of the background to the 'Monday Night Wars', I found this book largely disappointing.It appears to me to be nothing more than the product of a game of Chinese Whispers between men who obviously have some kind of axe to grind with Vince McMahon. Throughout the book the most common tools used to substantiate 'fact' are the words: ""He said."" or ""She said."" Also, for a book that was co-written by the man who ""pens the longest-running wrestling column in the country"" there are errors with regards to such simple things as the names of PPV events.If you want to read about pro-wrestling, read either of Mick Foley's books. As for this *cough* masterpiece....is it worth reading? As Steve Austin would have once said: ""AAh-AAh!"""
4,Beginners Take Note,"If you wish to learn the history of the worked arts and their cast and just what is going on in the ring, this is the book for you. If you have followed Vince and the resultant path (of rage) his career has taken, this will entertain you. All the scandals are here: the steroid trial, the travails of the ring boys, the horrors of being Vince's barber. The author is selective in his judgements (Bozell is an evil moralist; Mushnick's whining is good), and, as many of the below reviewers have pointed out, there are omissions, but the book breezes along entertainingly--and even those hard-bitten types who have mortgaged their homes for an Observer subscription will learn a few things. The fact that a man who makes a living with words published a wrestling book with no pictures makes this worth a look."
3,Good information but given awkwardly,"For information purposes, this is a good read for anyone like me who likes ""insider"" info about professional wrestling. There are a lot of interesting stories about the significant figures involved, and in wrestling, as any entertainment, the backstage perspective is a great alternative viewpoint for history.The only problem with the book is that it reads awkwardly at times. A story about the WWF is told and suddenly we switch to what's going in Atlanta with WCW, with no transition or explanation as to why it's important. It just seems as if information is provided so the authors can show off the information they have access to.For information, great book, for a good read, eh."
3,Very worthy investigation from a dedicated amateur historian,"As a journalist and friend of this author at the time of the publication of this book I have to say that this is a worthy contribution to the many theories surrounding the identity of Shakeapeare's 'Dark Lady' of the Sonnets......from London prostitutes to the the elegant lady, Mary Fitton herself, lady in waiting at the court of Elizabeth 1stArthur Marlowe was like a 'dog with a bone'on this subject and spent many years on his quest for answers to this complex subject. And as a friend I attended the opening of the Fitton family tomb in Gawsworth Church Cheshire where Arthur was hoping to find vital clues in his search for the truth. He was also in the company of the likes of Bernard Shaw and other eminent writers and academics , who also concluded that Mary Fitton was in fact the real 'Dark Lady'.This book is a valiant effort from a dedicated amateur historian.I have signed copy of the orignal publication should anybody be interested."
3,can't choose which set...,"i ordered this item not realizing that their were 3 different sets and that you were unable to pick which one you receive so i thought that when their wasn't an option that i was getting the one pictured in my cart but i received the middle one instead. i got it as a gift and was hoping for the one that was pictured first, the 3rd would have been good as well since it is like the first just different dolls but i guess i'm stuck with the ugly middle one since it's a waste of money to ship it back."
4,Good but not as good as the original dishes,"As others have mentioned, these are fired, not the same break resistant process the plates are made of.I wanted something that was small for dips and such, so these are perfect for that.Bottom clearly states ""microwave and oven safe"", so not sure what the reviewer was talking about who said they can't be used thusly, unless they've changed something more recently and the new ones are manufactured differently.My loss of one star was due to the bottoms. They are not as rough as, say, the simple lines napkin holder, but they ARE rougher, not something I would want to place on my wood surfaced table directly, so as to avoid scratches.Other than that, the finish is great, very smooth everywhere else other than the bottom, no marring, pitting, or bumps like the salt/pepper shakers had.One of the better accessories in the simple lines series, just wish they had made them of the same materials as the plates..."
1,Ramekin,I received some for Christmas which were awesome! I decided I needed more but they were broken when I received the package. It was horrible timing because I was in the middle of moving and didn't really know who to contact about the item being broken so I never got a replacement. The item itself is fantastic but only when you can use it!
4,"Pretty, but slightly flawed","Design is beautiful, and ceramic is sturdy and would hold up well to some wear and tear. Only issue I have with it is that the design itself is obviously digitized...there is some pixelation along the edges which in my view detracts from the quality."
4,Stylish Ramekins,This is a great set of ramekins. I love their clean design. They compliment any contemporary dinnerware.
2,not what i expected,i was disappointed when i receive this item. i thought it was not porcelain that i expect to receive and the fact that its made in china.
2,Not A Good Deal -,"The magazine is great, but Amazon's price is not. I'm in for 20 issues at $20 - get the insert card in the magazine's latest issue and go to the site listed to charge to your credit card and save the bother/cost of mailing in the charge later."
3,Too much advertising,It was hard to sift the advertising from the articles at times and while there is very good information to be gleaned I found myself not reading them for months and finally just tossing them.
2,Smallflower Tincture of Arnica,"While the product is a tincture of arnica it is 53 to 65% alcohol. This is a very weak tincture and severely degrades the performance of the arnica tincture. The stuff that Park Davis Drugs out of Detroit, MI was a much more concentrated version and really worked."
3,"Sardines good, a little too much mustard IMO",I have been making my way through different sardine brands and finally tried these. I enjoy the regular US brands of mustard sardines. I found these to be a little overboard on the mustard for my tastes. I would estimate there was approximately 3 tablespoons of a thick Dijon mustard in the package. The mustard just dominated everything and I tried to remove as much as of the mustard as possible.
3,first one not so good,"The dvd I received had only 5 minutes of the 54 minutes it was supposed to include. I called to complain, and was sent a replacement free of charge. The replacement video included all 54 minutes."
1,Got a pair of TEVA shoes instead of the die set.,I am attempting to return the shoes and hopefully I'll get the die set. Shoes instead of a die set. I'll update this review when if I get the right item.
5,Real Fast Shiping,"I ordered july, 12 and got it two days later july, 14 with standar shiping :)some stuff i order from amazon places sometimes takes forever to get to mealso the soldering wire looks cool :), cant wait to get my soldering iron to melt some of this cool stuff down :P"
5,Don't use lead free solder. Period.,"I bought some lead free solder, and it just doesn't work as well as lead solder. There is no substitute for lead solder on the market. Just buy these for electronic soldering and you will be happy."
4,Good results,"Flows well, and is a good size for repairing vehicle wiring. Lots of it on the roll, it will last me for years."
1,the worst,"This book portrays, I think, the most dysfunctional relationship I've read in any Harlequin. Plus there are typos.The Male Lead - no way could he ever be considered a hero - is verbally abusive. He calls her names, attacks her character, & demeans her right up to the very, very end, when apparently an alien takes over his body & he has a complete personality transformation. He's also physically abusive - shoves her, holds her down, forces his attentions on her. Until, of course, the Female Lead ""weakens"" and likes it, because she is TSTL, a doormat & easily manipulated. Until the very, very end, when she, too has a complete personality transformation. Unfortunate that neither was replaced by aliens sooner; it would've been a far better book.Plus there are typos. Off the top of my head: her noisy child is making a ""bracket"". An engaged woman is a ""fianoe"" - which is wrong twice. Many more, but that's all I can remember without searching through the book, which I will never open again."
1,This book portrays an abusive man and a submissive woman,"I have generally liked Jacqueline Baird's books but this one is terrible. It shows an aggressive and verbally abusive male and a woman that just takes it all in because she is hypnotized by the the sex. He calls her terrible names, accuses her of terrible things, drugs her, takes her baby and she is supposed to take it all because she loves him and can't say no to sex to him. This is a very dysfunctional relationship - both need therapy. I was disappointed that Ms. Baird likes to portray women and men in such a terrible way and then justify it because they have a baby and good sex. It is a shame she wrote it this way."
3,Finding your lost love on TV.,"Back Cover description: Raul's reason for revenge...Penny seized her opportunity to save the love she and Raul shared, and proposed marriage-but he turned her down flat! The misunderstandings of the past few weeks had left their mark and now Raul had got his revenge; he seemed to think Penny was nothing but a gold-digging tramp.But of all the gifts Raul had given Penny, none could match the one she took with her when she walked away from their relationship. Unbeknownst to Raul, she was carrying his child!This book got three stars because I really didn't like the beginning to the story, I almost didn't finish it. There was something about the first part of the plot that made Penny seem cheap. And the part about the bracelet was strange, I was glad she left it behind her. When the author moves the story past where Penny walks out, the whole plot gets better. Raul's character gets some depth and you find out what the bracelet means. Try it."
1,Dog!,"When I read a romance book, it is for relaxation and enjoyment.This is one book that will tense the muscles and make one scream foul. The man in this one is stupid and mean! Stupid men tend to be mean and mean men tend to be stupid. The man is not even a hero. He is not nice at all. He is physically and psychologically abusive. The girl is just as stupid and a coward. This is like a Lynne Graham novel called ""The Banker's Convenient Wife."" Don't bother unless you are into pain."
4,Good book about air combat,"Not an in depth analysys of air combat maneuvers and energy management as Shaw does in his books, however a good book about the so called ""Situational Awareness"", in my opinion the most important ace factor."
5,A small gem of a volume,"Although there are many books delaing with air combat stories, Mr Spick's old but excellent volume is a must-have for everyone interested in the ace producing virtues. ""Situational awareness"" is surely the most critical of them, as the author proves in many occasions and the book covers the whole age of aerial dogfights from the Great War to the '80s. There are many first hand accounts, many great stories and abundant information on tactics and technologies but, above all, Mr Spick's writing is the great advantage of this book. A nice addition to the library of every military aviation fan."
5,A very much insightful story!,"Now I really love George MacDonald's books after reading several ones.First, I love his imaginations, which are far beyond mine;Second, I love his deeply insights into human's mind and behaviors;Third, I love his beautiful language.I will certainly read more his stories, but I have no power to suggest others to read because this is only my personal feeling after reading his books."
5,Childhood Favorite,"this was a book I loved to check out again and again at the Library. The pictures are so beautiful and the storyline simple to follow. I've given this to a friends daughter and from what I was told, She loves it!"
2,Different reaction,"Just tried this one several times over a couple of days. Each time, burned more at first, more blurry, then cleared somewhat, but eyes still dry an hour later. Back to the drugstore to try a different formulation. It was definitely worth a try, and seems to have worked very well for other reviewers."
4,Good Product,I have used many kinds of eye drops for my dried eyes. I found this one very helpul and introduced to my friends. The few minutes of burry after applied is not that bad.
1,Tried 4 brands in 4 months. These are the worst.,"I had PRK surgery so I've been on the drops for months now. These are the only preservative free drops that I just can't use. They burn, make your vision blurry, and give me zero comfort. I found no differences in the other 3 brands I tried...they were all equally effective. But I'm throwing these away."
5,Love this Product.. Better than Any on the Market,"I used these years ago when I has LASIX done on my eyes. Now that my eyes seem to be drying out at night due to the heater, old age, or whatever.. I put a couple of drops in before bed and NEVER wake up with tired, red and scratchy eyes. I've tried all the drops on the market and these, IMO, are the best. Long-lasting.. don't have to keep reapplying, quick relief. This was a really good price on them, much better than at the stores. I've even used them on my poor old bulldog, who has horrible dry eye that nothing seems to help, and they work on him too !"
5,TheraTears Liquid Gel,"Thera Tears Liquid Gel has been the tears of my choice for years because it gives me relief from dryness that lasts longer than other tears. Also, I have not developed any allergic reaction to this product as I have to others. In 2001 I experienced Shingles in my cornea, after which my eyes were extremely dry. I experienced frequent scratched corneas, and my eyes always hurt. I was unable to use Restasis because my eyes were too dry. However, Thera Tears eventually provided enough lubrication so I could incorporate Restasis into my routine. I will not go anywhere without Thera Tears."
4,CUTE (for Dora!!),"I personally don't think there is anything ""cute"" about Dora normally, but this one actually is. My friend's 3 year old daughter is absolutely nuts over Dora and this was purchased as a gift for her. She is very into dressing herself now so I thought she'd get a kick out of the toddler look of this Dora, the pigtails, and especially the outfits to change her in to. I was right. There are cute outfits to buy seperately (which those I purchased at Toys R Us with a 'buy 2, get 1 free' sale). There's a birthday party outfit, holiday dress, pajamas, and I think it was a surfer girl outfit. Then they all come with some sort of extras, such as the pajama outfit comes with a little sleeping bag. I'd recommend it. It is cute, the fans of Dora, and probably non-fans alike, would like it."
5,Beautiful BIG doll,"I bought this doll for my neice for Christmas. Didn't get it until the 29th, but that's beside the point. This is a very nice looking doll. It's sizable, but that's a good thing. If you a looking for a gift for a Dora fan, it doesn't get much better than this."
1,Large and sort of creepy,"I ordered this for our daughters' birthdays, relying on the reviews on Amazon. They are not nearly as cute as the swimming Dora dolls.Splash Around Dora and TwinsThey are really big, and a little bit creepy looking. There's nothing overtly wrong with the product, but my husband, my babysitter, and I all felt, on first sight, that the dolls should be immediately returned because they are just weird. I add the review only to give another perspective, as all other reviews were so positive."
3,Not the best doll,"My grand-daughter was very much into Dora when I purchased this for her. The doll is hard, not really comfortable to play with. The clothes that can be purchased for the doll are very expensive."
2,head popped off,"I got this for my grandaughter who was 2 at the time. She loves Dora. Unfortunately one toss by her brother and Dora's head popped right off. Try as we might we couldn't attach her head back on. Rather than being upset, she ended up carrying the head around for a while! So, be forewarned."
1,too many problems,"I had this phone since three years ago, the reason i got it cause is free. however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does. it will stay on black screen for couple second or sometime just lock on the black screen. but once you take off the battery and resite the phone it will work again. i thought most of these phone can last at less 5 years, what's up with that. well lucky my girl is going to get a new phone next may so i don't think it will be another samsung cheap phone."
2,Serious Quality Control Problem,"This phone has so much potential. I really wanted to like it. But I went through 4 of these phones between June and September.There is a SERIOUS quality control problem with these phones. The first one just didn't get signal beyond 1 or 2 bars. Anywhere. The second had a speaker problem. I could hear people, but they frequently couldn't hear me. Third phone would randomly shut down regardless of battery life. Fourth phone, the monitor would randomly stop working.Verizon can be a great service. As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time on the phone with their customer service department. They're nice, they're friendly, and if this model phone were of the same quality I wouldn't be writing this review.I've since switched to an LG VX3300."
5,Great Reliable Phone,"I have had the Samsung A650 phone for a year now and I have been very pleased with its performance. The battery life is great-I usually charge it twice a week. This phone has survived bouncing around in my backpack and being dropped regularly with no signs of damage. It has a relatively user friendly interface and I haven't had any problems with call quality. In summary, this is a great, simple, reliable phone."
2,Not a good design,"I have had this phone for about a year (from Verizon) and it has constantly has had problems. The phone has stopped continously ringing since about 9-10 months ago and instead rings for a second or two before falling silent. It also will answer without being open. The phone takes about 3 to 5 minutes to load depending on the signal. The features are also terrible with few wallpapers, no games, and bad ringtones (at most 20, half are bells in different tones)."
5,A GOOD PHONE,"4.5 Stars!!! This is the first phone I have ever had, since I am just going into middle school. I think this phone is good, but is doesn't have a camera. It is very easy to use and it caller I.D. The numbers are spaced out good and it is very clear. The few things I would like to have on this phone would be some better rings (but you can just get them at www.vzwpix.com!), some equiped games (you can get them at www.vzwpix.com, too!), and wallpaper.(you can get them too!)Overall, this is a very good phone! I would still like a camera. You should get this phone if you haven't ever had a phone before. Again, you should get this phone."
1,TOO HOT TOO HANDLE,"I got this phone the other day, thought it would be a good basic phone, and the first problem was the volume settings. Just because you use the volume control on the side, it does not adjust all of the settings with sound; like you have to individualy set the ringer volume, than the speaking volume, etc.Another major problem was that it would burn up when talking on the phone about 2 min in the conversation. It would heat to about 100 degrees F. It was hot enough to cause burns to the cheek and chin. Doing research, I relieze that all Samsung models (a610, a650, a670, etc.) have this same problem.The phone is not pre-loaded with any games, nor any good ring tones, except the 10 pathetic tones and bells.One more thing, the reason Verizon is offering the ""Buy 1, Get 3 Free"" is because they know there are flaws, plus this phone has been availible on the market for years and they need to deplete their supply for new models.I recomend the Kyocera KX1v!"
2,"Mediocre Phone, Freezes Up Often","I've had my Samsung A650 for about a year and a half now using Verizon wireless. Its a pretty mediocre phone.Firstly, it has about the fewest features I've ever seen on a phone. Its barebone all the way. Secondly, the signal strength is poor. Whenever I compare signal strength on my A650 to another phone next to mine (usually a verizon phone since my whole family uses verizon), the A650 will always have a weaker signal, sometimes much weaker. Thirdly and most importantly, it just freezes up sometimes. Nothing works. The buttons don't work, and you can't make calls out or receive calls. You have to actually physically remove the battery, and then reinsert it and then restart the phone. My phone freezes up every one or two weeks, no reason and no warning."
3,Awesome Discipleship tool,"I use it daily. An essential tool in my relationship building with Christ Jesus, I highly recommend for the believer and non believer alike."
5,Great for self-study and study groups,"Goldman's text is wonderful for someone desiring to learn Latin on their own. From the second chapter onwards, all the readings consist of revised excerpts from Ovid's Metamorphoses. As you are taught more grammar and vocabulary, she gradually introduces more and more of the original into the readings until you are reading what Ovid actually wrote. And although there is no answer key, the excercises (of which there are plenty) are usually of just the right difficulty: just hard enough to help you in learning Latin, but not so hard that you can't figure them out on your own.I would also recommend the accompanying workbook, which is a little more difficult, but does include an answer key."
5,Great alternative to Wheelock,"I learned Latin using Wheelock's textbook, studying with an engaging instructor. That is an excellent text but, as many have noted, it is very dry. This book is more entertaining: less philosophy and more blood, sex, and other agreeable topics. Highly recommended."
3,mediocre,I used this book in school and it was average. It could be a better book with better grammar explanations and better exercises. Pronouns and demonstratives could be explained more in depth. The stories in the beginning of each chapter are entertaining and fun. It certainly is better than Wheelock (which is dull and boring) and I recommend this book after completing Linney's Getting started with Latin. After purchasing other books I am now using Camgridge Part I and is the best book out there for learning the language.
4,"Great, but difficult without a teacher.","Salve! This book is really great, as long as you have a teacher who will elaborate on the short grammar sections. With a teacher, you can learn Latin with little difficulty, but I cannot seem to progress with self-study. Probably, with real dedication to learning, it could be done. I don't know what else to suggest, but I would look for a text better suited to self-study (maybe Cambridge?)."
5,Fantastic,"This is a thorough, logical, helpful way to introduce yourself to what may be an intimidating language to learn."
1,"Do not buy this CHEAP, DANGEROUS toy set","I bought this set for my son's fourth birthday. It was the only thing he asked for, his icecream cones from a previous set having recently broken after over a year of hard use by my two and four year olds. Within 24 hours his favorite item, the chocolate ice cream had broken. All he did was tap it against a couch. I saw the event. It exposed jagged edges and I had to throw away his beloved toy. I'll never forget how much he cried :( Over the next week many of the other toys broke as well, one in my hands, I was just transporting it :P The plastic is cheap and breaks into very sharp shards. I'm so unbelievably disappointed and planning to call the manufacturer, I still have my receipt, I just wish I'd kept more of the pieces."
5,Puts a Smile on Your Face,"Some books have magic in them. You know the ones. They stay with you long after you've closed the cover. The rhythm of Ryland's words along with Howard's whimsical illustrations will have you ""zinging pears"" right along with Mr. Putter.The Mr. Putter series is just about as good as children's writing gets. You can't go wrong with any one of them. But this one is our favorite."
5,Have to read these to your children!,"If you have never purchased a series for your children, Get this series, great for ages 3 to 8, Great read-a-louds to children who are not yeat reading at a strong 2nd grade level. Great early chapter books for 2nd grade readers.These books are so touching, great, kind stories, with a touch of silliness. You can feel how Mr. Putter feels during the story. You always feel happy for Mr. Putter at the end of the story. I always feel like I want to be their with him enjoying his good time.How Cynthia Rylant can turn a simple subject like pickig pears to make Jelly into feeling like you have been on a wonderful adventure is a gift few writters have. I highly recommend all these stories for boys and girls."
5,"Cute, compassionate, a great kids book","We read this one over and over. It's great for beginning readers. In addition to being an enjoyable and entertaining book for children, it inspires understanding and empathy of aging people (and animals), something many youngers lack. Other books in the series are just as enjoyable. Nice artwork too."
2,"Oy, vey!","This book has negligible value to the reader. I say this as a knee-jerk supporter of Israel. Eban has written a somewhat boring, unmemorable, and exceedingly tendentious book. There is a surfeit of better books on Israel, the conflict, and the appertaining issues. Find one of them, and pass this book by."
5,I love this powder!,"This powder is a great alternative to store-bought baby powder. It is gentle and healing, and I don't feel bad about using it on my girls (I have a 2 year old and a 3 month old). It helps to heal that ""rawness"" that babies get in the folds of their neck and it soothing on bums. I will definitely continue to buy!"
1,A big disappointment,"I'm always looking for new ideas. I didn't find any in this book. The chapter titles are great, but then all you find is a 3 page chapter, with most of the content promoting the author of that chapter (yes, there are many authors). The book promotes different speakers, coaches, and others. I'm not happy that I paid money for such a shallow book."
1,Rather get a cold-call from a stock broker,"I didn't see the other reviews until after my copy arrived. Having now wasted a weekend reading this book, I have to agree with everyone. The topic sounds great, the book isn't."
1,Just Bot It,"I just bot this book from my local bookstore. Then I see Amazon has a 30% discount. What's more, I see there are 4 reviews. Three of the reviews have 1 star while the fourth has 5 stars.I may be overly skeptical but they way the 5 star was written coupled with the vastly different rating, it certainly sounds like a ""related party"" tried to come to the rescue. The writing style sounds like the publishers themselves tried the hype.Off to read the book, hope I am wrong."
5,Great Knife,This is a very nice knife. Great for everyday carry. Super sharp out of the box. Fit and finish is excellent. I can place this knife next to a Case XX and it is just as well made. You will not be disappointed. The seller ships very fast.
5,Pregnant Students,I have had numerous students that have gotten pregnant..and needed some guidance helping my students. I knew that you were an Ashtanga Vinyasa teacher and that you had practiced while you were pregnant...this inspired me to purchase your dvd so that I can have a better understanding of the different stages of pregnancy....Your dvd has helped me tremendously and I love the sequences you provided......I have encouraged many of my students to purchase your dvd. Thanks so much for inspiring mothers-to-be to continue their yoga practice.
2,Boring!,"I've only done the first trimester section of this video, which I would think would be the more vigourous of the three, and I was bored out of my mind! There is a lot of sitting and breathing and putting your chin to your chest. There a few poses, but they seem to be mainly stretches with a few (very few) squats thrown in. The whole time I kept thinking....""well - I guess we're warmned up now, when's the real work going to start?"" I am not by any means a super fit person. Prior to becoming preganant I did yoga about once a week, and other types of exercise sporadically.This seems more for someone looking to meditate or do some mild stretching than for those looking for a real workout."
5,Highly recommended!,"I tried all kinds of DVDs during my pregnancy (from Shiva Rea to Gabrielle Reece's videos), but this is the only one I kept returning to. I used to practice Ashtanga yoga, but hadn't been doing it for several years and figured this might be a good way to get back into yoga -- slowly. It was challenging enough and about the right length for me (~45 mins). I really liked Cathy Louise's style of leading you through the positions, too. I used it during my second and third trimesters (mainly the third) and will definitely use it again for my next pregnancy. Oh, and I'm using it postpartum, too!"
5,Love this!,"I've been using the DVD in my second trimester (and now in my third) and love it.I'm lucky that I get to attend her real live classes, which have been such a sacred nest for me during my pregnancy - and the DVD is a beautiful way to be able to take this home and continue what I experience in class anytime I want. Things can get so busy from day to day, but I find that your DVD is just the right length of time to be able to fit this into your day. The poses are very gentle and nurturing to our changing bodies, and remind us of the important exercises we should be doing throughout our pregnancies. I also find it such a beautiful way to bond with our babies.Yoga is all around recommended during pregnancy, and I definitely recommend this DVD too."
4,A nice flow,"I purchased this prenatal yoga dvd because a lot of the reviewers mentioned that they practiced Ashtanga yoga prior to pregnancy, this dvd is recommended at Ashtanga.com, the instructor is an Ashtanga instructor and because I really disliked the prenatal Vinyasa flow dvd I purchased. I find Cathy's sequences to be nice and calming. There are some challenges and lots of great poses to stretch out the hips. I like that there is a new sequence for each trimester and the length of each. Plus it's filmed in beautiful Hawaii! My only complaint about this dvd is I was hoping it would be more ashtanga-like but I guess I'll have to save my beloved practice for after the baby arrives."
1,monotoneous record,"I am kloot's CD Natural History kicks off well, but gets dull soon. A minimilastic setting, like starsailor, can get boring proves this new band.Leadman Charles L. Deck hasn't got the vocal capacities for a full CD. Perhaps some their long awaiting new album 'lamotrigine' will prove otherwise."
3,Good but not great,"Although the book seems very thorough on the surface, as you begin to build the robot described, obvious flaws come to play, Parts seem to jump at you from nowhere, dimensions seem to be incorrect, and the ""debugging"" leaves something to be desired.However, it is a good resource for the first time 'bot builder, and can get you thinking in the ways of design, construction and programming.As for the bot itself... As reproduced exactly from the books instructions there are problems structurally, and programatically, that can be overcome with some ingeuity.So, If you are looking for a fool proof step by step to bot building, try Gordon Mccomb's Robot builder Bonanza, however if you are a step or two into the game already, then get this book."
5,Very Impressive robot ever!!!,"This book is truly amazing for robot hobbyist like me. I built a different robot using Karl Williams instructions even though it for the robot in his book. I built the robot too and it's real easy to build. I built the main controller board using a solderless breadboard and made the infared sensor board using the radioshacks PCB kits, it was a little different though. For the programs I had to tweak them because i couldn't afford the Picbasic pro, so with my little imagination I got some of the programs to work. This book is a must get and it's one of my favorites too. if you want to built a walking robot this one is worth building. so don't just look and read the book build it and I promise you will have lot's of fun just messing around with it."
2,"OK for beginners, needs to be revised","This is an OK read for a garden novice, it is easy to read and has decent drawings for illustrations. It is also dated (26 years old) which is particularly noticeable in the sections about mulches, fertilizers and pesticides. There is not enough information for backyard growers with limited space, and if you prefer to practice integrated pest management or organic gardening, you will not find a lot of information or encouragement here.After more than a quarter of a century, this booklet ought to be revised."
3,OK for beginners,The information was very basic and not complete. It's OK for the novice blueberry grower but if you have been growing blueberries this book won't be terribly useful.
2,I don't like it,"This book also arrived all bent up, but I'm trying to straighten it up. I need the info in it, so I'm not going to return it again."
5,Not very big but packed full of information.,"It's not a very large book but it is packed with very useful information. My husband says he ""got more information out of this little book than he got out of the big technical books on blueberries"". It is very useful for the everyday gardener."
4,Just what I wanted,A friend of mine has a blueberry orchard and has read this book to help her take care of it. She said it helped a lot.
1,ALLERGEN ALERT: TOXIC CHEMICALS INCLUDED,"Item contains potental allergens: maladextrose, silica, xylitol. Seller would not accept return after allergy was discovered upon first and only usage. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR TREATMENT OF ""LEAKY GUT SYNDROME"" or anyone with chemical sensitivity issues (including Fybromialgia, Chronic Fetegue Syndrome, etc.)"
4,"Fun collection of problems, quotes and trivia","This book has two parts- a collection of problems you're invited to solve using principles of modern (quantum) physics. And a collection of trivia, quotes and miscellanea in the margin about modern physics. I especially liked the trivia. Find out about Nikola Tesla, why space must have three dimensions, what cold fusion might be, faster-than-light travel, and how your microwave works.The book is surprisingly technical- I imagine few people who aren't physicists will solve the problems ( I certainly didn't). So just read the problems and learn from the answers. Watch out too- there are quite a few technical equations in the answers.I learned a lot, and had fun too."
3,Futuristic Sam Spade against patent thieves,"Jeter admitted that he's got problems with copyright thieves. What writer doesn't? Is this book wish fulfillment or what?In ""Noir"" his detective McNihil (who's been surgically altered to only see the world in black and white) is tasked with chasing down copyright thieves and administering punishment.The story's dark, and the punishments are novel---for example, a man who infringed upon an English tea cosy mystery author's domain was killed, ground up, and canned so the author could feed him to her cats.""Noir"" isn't a fast or fun read, but the book does raise questions about our cyber-corporate environment and creator's rights--and wrongs---that are interesting."
2,Fito suena demasiado a Fito,"Despues de un album evolutivo (Naturaleza Sangre), este suena demasiado a Fito Paez. Debe satisfacer a los fans que le piden mas de lo mismo, no algo mejor. Las canciones son bien elaboradas, con letras llenas de hermosos versos y figuras literarias, musica con arreglos perfectos, pero con el sabor añejo del amor desues del amor y circo beat."
4,Excellent text but cost too much,"This is a good book in geomechanics, co-authored by pioneers like Pastor, Chan, Schrefler. The materials presented are very dense and compact, and is a good reference for researchers. However, as a poor researcher myself, I think it cost too much. I wonder why they never intend to publish it in paperback. An exploitation to researchers pocket, indeed, if they dont mind me saying so.BTW,.... That will make your book famous. It is inappropriate to use Zienkiewicz name to sell yourself."
4,Nice set but box a bit small,"This is a nicely made and durable croquet set. My main complaint is that it takes quite a bit of effort getting it back into the box. The mallets and balls have to be placed in just one way, sort of puzzle-like, to get the lid to close. An extra inch or so would have avoided that. Also, the hinges and latch are a bit cheesy, but so far they have no broken."
3,cute,cute for a lil cabin or an outdoor theme room. Goes well in my son's room who is 13 and it fits in with many room color ideas
5,fishing rules sign,"This sign was just as advertised. It's has great detail on it's design. Also a fun conversatioal piece as well. I have mine placed by my backyard pond, it looks great!"
5,Brandnew powerful Dewalt drill,"Bought this drill to replace one that came in a kit that went bad after 4 years. The price of this bare-tool made it much more affordable than having the other repaired. Can't beat a Dewalt in reliability, durability and power."
4,GOOD,This was purchased for work. It does the job and is the go-to drill. And it fit the battery pack we already had.
5,Drill,The product arrived on time no problems - it is one of my favorite tools as was my last one until I wore it out.
4,Great bachlorette gift,"I gave this as a gift for my sister's bachlorette party, and it was a hit. It was exactly as pictured, and is delicate, so should be washed separately in delicate cycle or hand washed in sink."
2,Missing Half of it!,"The sizes are not clear. Apparently, plus and queen are the same. You can't find that info anywhere. It's cute, but I got the mini dress but no matching G-string. So, the ""dress"" is pretty much useless without the complete package. I should have just ran downtown and picked one up."
1,Don't take the word small lightly,"Length:: 4:38 MinsRight now I am LMAO, at the top of this review it is asking about a ""TOY"". When I purchased this and read the description and saw the price I thought I had found just what I was looking for. It is very small anyway when I received the package in the mail and am doing this review I now see that I must have purchased a toy. It is so small I'm doing a video review so you will actually believe what you see. Unless you are a jeweler this is probably not the parts tray you are looking for. Also I have contacted the seller via email several times and have not received a response. This shipping was twice the price of the tray so I guess I ended up buying something for the landfill and helped to stimulate the economy. Not to mention the contribution to the carbon ""fingerprint"". Don't waste your money."
3,Good for basic info and easy research,"With its informative details and beautiful pictures, this book would interest history and gardening buffs alike."
5,Watch out!,Stumbled upon this band on accident during a show in Chicago. Ohmygosh! These kids definitely have talent. I hear this is their 1st official Sony/Epic release before their May 30th full album. Radio friendly and positive fab music. This is a definite buy.
1,SOMETIMES A MEMORY IS BETTER THAN THE FACT,"I'M 58 YEARS OLD AND I ALWAYS WATCHED HOWDY DOODY WHEN I WAS A KID. THEN I GREW UP AND HE WENT OFF THE AIR. I ALWAYS CHERISHED THE MEMORY OF WATCHING HOWDY AND I COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM AS AN ADULT SO I BOUGHT THE DVD. LET ME TELL YOU, IN MY OPINION ""EVEN UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF TV"", US KIDS WERE OBVIOUSLY ENTERTAINED BY ANYTHING, BECAUSE AFTER ONE HALF OF AN EPISODE I WAS TWISTING TO FINISH WATCHING IT. TOTALLY BORING STUFF. TO ME THE MEMORY OF WATCHING IT WAS PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE GOOD TIMES AND CARE FREE LIFE THAT I WAS LIVING AS A KID. BUT WATCHING IT NOW WAS REALLY A DISAPPOINTMENT TO MY MEMORY. I WISH I LEFT WELL ENOUGH ALONE ! BUT THAT'S JUST ME !KIDS TODAY ARE SO LUCKY TO HAVE SPONGEBOB."
3,Not for the casual viewer!,I remember (vaguely) watching this show when I was little so I was a little excited to see it as an adult. Maybe I had higher expectations than I should have because I was bored to tears with the first episode and couldn't watch any more beyond it. I passed the set on to friends that indicated they'd love to watch them. I think that you really have to be into Howdy Doody because it's an acquired taste (at best) otherwise.This could have been a nice gift for older members of my family that had really remembered watching this live years ago...
1,Howdy Doody Order,I tried to buy this set From Amazon but they didn't have it.That is after months of waiting and receiving emails that the DVD's were on their way.Finally canceled order and bought off Ebay.Bad business on Amazon's part!
3,Change isn't always good,"I really enjoyed Ult. X-Men 1-8. However this last issue .....The thing I didn't like about it, is that they brought some familiar faces from the X-Men world, but they're NOTHING like they originally were. Thats worked well for this franchise in the past, but now Its irritating. They introduced Sinister in this volume. He's NOTHING like he should be. He's no scientist .... he's a bum. Literally. {Grunts in remeberence of it} I gave it 3 stars because the main characters continue to grow, its just the new villians they face that suck."
3,Pretty ok start,"this was a good start to BKV's run, picked up right where Ult. X-Men left off and characterization the characters they should be. The art was decent. **Spoilers** pretty much this book introduced Northstar, Sunspot, Mr.Sinister and Apocalypse. All but Sinister were pretty brief in the story. Sinister was sort of interesting, talking to himself, killing people nearly murdering Bobby and the Professor which is pretty good. The relationship between Bobby and Rouge is good along with the good characterization of Bobby and how he feels him position on the is different now. overall a pretty decent book i guess i'd recommend it for hardcore fans, but not so hardcore should look for the book cheaper somewhere else."
5,Newer And Better Sinister,"Out of all my Ultimate X-Men Novels this one rates as one of my favorites. Short of Vol. 6 and 8. I love a good read and solid story and though this may have little to do with future stories it takes a sorry, sad, goofy looking villian and turned him into a crazy and scary man with 45's. He looks better and his power of hypnosis works well with what he trying to do, kill mutants. The possibility of another major villian in this novel also leaves you with some high expectations for future novels.Thank God for Ultimate Universe"
4,Tears for Fears,"Excellent CD. sound quality is good, song selection is great, includes all of their more popular songs as well as their less known but still good selections."
5,Real 80's,"Okay, I was a teenager in the 80's. And I mean, the entirety of my teenage years were in the 80's. Sadly, I had no connection with my peers at the time and totally missed 80's music.Recently, I've been trying to catch up on what other kids were listening to back then.... but hearing this CD, I realise that this band captures the feel of the 80's to me. I'm surprised how familiar much of this disc is, considering I only learned the band's name after seeing Donnie Darko.This is great, fun stuff."
5,Tears for Fears,"This album by Tears for Fears is an absolute must if your a huge fan of the Kurt and Roland. I was born in 1990, but still appreciate all of the older music. In fact, I find that the older music is much better than the newer music. There are very few newer songs (1999-present) that I like. 60's, 70's, 80's, and most of the 90's are all awesome! Tears For Fears is my second favorite band. The songs are all great, there is not one song on this album that I would say to skip everytime."
3,80's Music,Classic 80's music. Very nostalgic and refreshing to listen to from time to time. They were one of the best in that era.
4,Great fun to liston to,I became a big fan of Tears for Fears with the movie Real Genius. Their music is classic 80's but still great to listen to.
5,All the best songs from this group on one CD,Fantastic collection of their greatest hits. If you don't want to have to collect every album they've ever made and just want the good songs then get this and you'll be happy.
2,The Worst of 80's FM Pop Radio Bands (and some filler),"Tears for Fears is one of the worst bands of the 80's. Their songs represented some of the worst excesses of the music of that era; most of them are chock full of pretentiousness and cliche, epsecially the heinously overplayed and overrated ""Shout"". How can a band that had at most four relatively successful chart singles produce a ""best of"" album? Simple...you mix their chart singles with album filler and sell it to the gullible and naive.I gave this album two stars instead of one because Roland Olazabal is a highly technically proficient musician, but unless you're a completist or hopelessly in love with the 80's, a decade I consider to be one of the worst ever for popular music, I'd pass on this CD."
2,E snapped when installing,"I've never broken a string till I tried this set; the E string broke as I was installing it. Yes, I am a beginner but I've installed all my strings myself and have tried at least 6 different sets thus far. Rest of the strings seem to be doing fine."
2,Sonar 6 Know A Little!,"I usually love dvd tutorials, but this one is very short and not very helpful. It teaches you how to do basics, which is good if you are a beginner, but if you're a Sonar user and want to know what's NEW in sonar 6 his is not going to help much. You're better off buying the book, or just searching around on the 900+ page PDF manual that's in the documentation folder. I know reading isn't as fun as watching a video, but this doesn't teach you much, even for the basics. It's more like a Sonar 6 demo (just showing you around but no details!!!). When I got Sonar 6 I couldn't wait for a dvd tutorial; I jumped on this as soon as it came out and was very disappointed. This is definately not worth the money, trust me!"
4,Mystery Hero Outfit,"I purchased this costume from Eastern Toys.It arrived on time, and was pleased with how the outfit looked on me.My only dissapointment would be that it did not arrive with the hat, which is the main part of the costume!!"
4,bic crystal gel,"these pens are great, won't fail you. the only minuses is that they get used up quite fast and that they're not suitable for any type of paper (on finer papers or more absortive ones too much ink goes into the paper - guess that's why they get used up so fast). but on normal paper they're flawless and are great for fast note taking as well as when you want your writing to be understandable:)"
1,You get what you pay for...,"I bought these along with the red ones. Half the pens don't work, and the rest come out very light when I write. I wouldn't buy these again."
3,religious,This was recommended as a text book in a class i was taking. Personally i didn't find it that great but a friend did.
2,lower your expectations,"The authors disabuse the readers of any hope of realizing their deep community longings, and sternly admonish them to take seriously the ""realities of modern life."" After all (the authors say), those real religious communities, like the Amish, lack personal freedom, privacy, opportunity for personal advancement, and progress. Apparently, modernity is more important than Christ's call to ""follow me."" Or did Jesus say, follow progress and personal advancement and I missed it?! As if."
5,A Great Unit,"This auto air purifier moves quite a lot of air, and cleans it well. To test it, I had a friend hold a lit cigarette in front of the intake, and breathed the air coming out of the unit. There was no smell of smoke! After running for ten minutes in my truck I can tell that the air has a ""cleaner"" smell.The filters are easy to replace by simply twisting the front intake grill about a quarter inch. The unit hangs on the back of a front seat with a strap and is out of the way. Unlike dashboard models, no screws or velcro are required to keep it from moving around, and it will not be flying around loose in a hard braking incident or in an accident.The company that Amazon placed the order with, Safe Home Products, was a great vendor to deal with; their customer service is excellent.I highly recommend this unit and Safe Home Products to any allergy sufferers that need air purification in their automobile!"
3,"Interesting, Enlightening, but Dense","I learned much that I had not learned from films and other books, so this book is worth a read. However, the author does not define some nautical terms and under-explains some aspects of seafaring even as he over-explains some aspects of human relations."
4,UT 3 review,"Been looking forward to this game for a long time. a loyal gamer to the UT series.The modding tools are one of the best there is.The gameplay mechanics are solid. However the single player campaign and the new orb feature for warfare are extremely lacking and annoying. The graphics are gorgeous. too many of the wanted game types from older UT games are missing,leaving an extreme workload for modders. The engine is still hands down the best yet."
2,Out of box issues,"Well i got the collector's edition. I had some Problems saving settings and the menu was annoying at first. but as far as i know all the problems i had were fixed with the first patch.so unless you have an internet connection or you can bear with your settings reseting i wouldn't get it.They have removed some game modes from ut2004 so there is a bit less variety in this game at first,but modder's will probably make some more. the tutorials included on the bonus disk are not as varied as the one's that come with the ut2004 editor's choice edition but i guess it is a different engine nowoverall an initial disappointment but if your a fan of classic ut it is similar to that now"
2,Let down for sure,"2 major problems with this game....1. It wasn't any where near finished at time of release. It's full of bugs and there is no useable dedicated server package. Most of the gameplay has that unpolished feel.2. It was obviously not intended for the PC. The lack of options and the way the vehicles handle all show that this was meant to be played with a controller, not a mouse and keyboard.I could go into detail, but it's too much for here. Look up different forums around the net (beside epic's) and you'll see what I'm talking about. All I can hope is that future patches will fix some of the problems. Until then I wasted my money."
3,"Great game, but still disappointing","This game has an overall unfinished feel to it. It COULD have been a great game, but the UI is very poorly designed, and the maps feel very limiting and lack the variety found in UT2004. The actual gameplay is great, but don't expect to find anything cutting edge that will blow your socks off."
1,Not a typical magnetix product!!,"In our family we love magnetix but are VERY disappointed in the magnaman toys. They WILL NOT stick together. They just fall apart constantly. It is impossible to assemble them, much less play with them! This was a huge surprise considering the high quality of regular magnetix building products and the high price of these toys. BUMMER!"
3,It is good for learning the EAGLE software,"It is short and easy to learn the basics of creating schematics, layout, and producing gerber files with the EAGLE software only.A free basic version of EAGLE software is included on the CD and it is good enough for learning purpose. The Book's title is ""Build Your Own Printed Circuit Board"" which I think is misleading. The book deals with just the EAGLE software and does not teach how to physically build a printed circuit board. For learning the EAGLE software, it is a good starting point."
2,A lot better if it was readable,"The book is OK although it totally leans toward Eagle software and doesn't say much else about other packages. The real downer is that the most important illustrations in the book are printed black on black on dark gray, like mud-on-mud graphics and you can't tell what's going on - at least in my copy. This is on the most important illustraions (to me anyway) which were the illustrations showing actual board traces and autorouting. Without being able to make out the illustrations the text becomes pretty meaningless. This is a very amateur graphics mistake that screams ""High School Yearbook""."
2,Its just ok.,"This book is only a generic introduction to making circuit boards. It should not be called ""Build your own"" because the author only spends few pages describing the actual process of etching the boards. Rather MOST of the book is an Eagle cad manual with some poor illustrations that look washed out on the Kindle.If you have etched one board in your life you probably should just skip this book. Most information contained in there can also be found free on Instructables or youtube.As a hobby circuit builder I was really hoping to find some professional advice on board layout and mass production. The only recomendations in this book were to use Eagle and send your board overseas.Save your $16."
3,Pretty Good But Not Fantastic,"The book, in my honest opinion, is good. I've made it to page 40 already, and I like the opinions and facts it presents. However, my only real complaint is that the disk that comes with the book was out of date by a lot, and refused to install on my computer flat out. I had to go online and download the program myself.The disk does, however, does make a nice coaster."
2,Only use i could find in it was the glossary.,"The book has a catchy headline. Though,i didn't find any practical use of it in helping me start with board designs.It's simply an echo of the Eagle manual (which is better ) and the tips or tricks, tactics claimed by the author are a mere few lines of jargon explanation in the entire book."
3,"an ""ok"" book.","Even though the author seems to ramble on chapter after chapter making it out like building circuit boards are the hardest thing possible to do, it's an ""ok"" book. I think where this guys ego kicked him in the butt though is the time he spent talking about those very complex boards with thousands - millions of traces like the ones in your computer. I feel as if most people buy this book to gain a better understanding of how to build their own simple boards, not try to re-design a motherboard or anything."
4,Good Pocket-size Source of Pictures of Tuscany,"Tuscany Style: Landscapes, Terraces & Houses, Interiors, Details (Icons)has many images (photographs) representative of Tuscany: the countryside, houses, and interiors. It easily fits in a purse or case to take along during shopping trips. Purchase this for its images, however, as the book does not have explanations or instruction/ guidelines. A helpful resource for examples of Tuscan colors and styles."
4,Tuscany decoration,"This was bought for a gift for a relative who is building a house in the Tuscany style. Before I gave the book to her, I glanced through it. She claims she was having problems selecting colors and quickly making the many choices that are necessary when one builds a new house and this book, small enough to fit in her purse, was very helpful and convenient to pull out and consult when she had a question."
2,cute but my dogs won't touch it,"This is a cute toy but something about it makes my dogs have no interest in it. These dogs take interest in almost any toy I've ever given them, including rubber chew toys. But the Zanies rubber chicken just lays on the floor getting pushed around by the roomba every day.The squeaker in this toy does get their attention but as soon as they run up and see the chicken, they lose interest.I have other Zanies toys that the dogs absolutely love. I think they generally make a good product but this must have something that turns the dogs off?"
2,Chicken Bit the Dust,I have a 7 lb. yorkie. He is obsessed with this chicken. In the first day he had broken the squeaker. And he loves it so much I have to get him another one.
1,Doesn't work like another brand I use,"I use 5 HTP for sleep. The brand I normally use -- works, this one did not. So I threw it out and bought my regular brand"
3,PACY RECOUNTING OF THE COOK STORY AND LINKS WITH COLLINGRIDG,"Vanessa Collingridge has written a pacy book that nicely describes the 3 expeditions of Cook to the Pacific and focuses on his cartography, his ideas about scurvy, his ideas about how to relate to the peoples encountered...and about the links between the Cook mythology (eg discoverer of Australia) and reality (he was not the first).It's annoying the book I bought (hardback) did not contain better maps...(there were virtually none)...so I had trouble following the twists and turns of Cooks travels."
4,Incredibly Soothing,"I discovered ""Merlin's Magic"" by happy accident while surfing thu some digital music channels on my cable TV. This is some of the most perfect music I have ever heard and of I kind I have never heard before. I listen to it while meditating and before bed. It relaxes and centers me. A terrific find.Captain Kundalini"
3,OK pen with some QA problems,"Bought a 7 count pack of these blue gel cristals. Three of them wouldn't even start writing. Just streaked a little and seemed to scratch the paper. The ones that work, flow ink very well, almost gush! Work good for around the house scribbling (shopping lists and the like).Emailed Bic to let them know they have quality problems with these and received a prompt answer in the mail in the form of a very nice coupon.Hope they will work on their production problems and fix. These are a nice cheap pen all around, but pens that don't work are inexcusable!For work purposes where neatness and reliability count, I'll stick with the Pentel Energels."
1,Falls apart. Weak magnets. No good,"We like the geomags and other magnetic building toys, but this guy won't stay together. If you try to pick him up his legs & arms fall off or he separates at the waist. Weak, weak magnetics makes this toy completely useless. Not much good other than fridge magnets at this point. Just don't try to hang up anything more than a single sheet of paper."
5,"Great book, wonderful insights","I am the author of a popular manufacturing textbook. If you are looking for detailed information about casting processes, pick up one of Campbell's books. They are full of useful information, and reflect his extensive experience in the area."
1,Rock hard mouth piece,"My son hated it. He LOVES the Gerber Transition cup (7oz...not the other Gerber cup.) and he's okay w/ the Avent cup. They both have very soft pieces that go in his mouth and feel good...not rock hard! Most sippy cups are extremely hard to get anything out of, this is one of them. Skip it!"
3,Great Product - If you like PINK :),"This is a great product. We've tried lots of sippy-cups for our 18 month old. This one is good for him and good for us. Its very easy for him to hold and use, but doesn't leak. Its also very easy for us to disassemble, wash and reassemble. I would love to give this product 5 stars... BUT I have one complaint: You can't choose the color, and the PINK is VERY PINK. I just don't feel right giving them to my son, at least not in public."
3,These do NOT contain PVC,"I have been doing a lot of research on sippy cups and these cups keep getting great reviews, but I was worried by what the other reviewer wrote about the PVC. I called Playtex to ask them, and they are NOT made of PVC- they are made of polypropylene, which is considered safe. Furthermore, the packaging on these cups specifically says ""BPA and Pthalate Free"" which means it cannot be made of PVC because PVC contains Pthalates.I have not actually tried these cups because I was concerned (which is why I only gave it a 3-star ""neutral"" review), but now that I know that they do not contain PVC I will be buying them because they get great reviews. I just wanted to clear the air about the PVC- perhaps the other reviewer had outdated information?"
4,From a fellow author,"I am very interested in Chicago history (being the author of ""A Chicago Firehouse: Stories of Wrigleyville's Engine 78) myself. The ""Encyclopedia of Chicago"" has some great information, but I found some of the places it was listed as confusing. This is a HUGE undertaking and realize pulling all that information together was not an easy project, however, I felt some entries should have been included under their own headings, such as Biograph Theater or John Dillinger. Even so, I learned a multitude of information and enjoyed reading through the volume. It will be kept on my reference shelf for many years to come."
5,The absolute best book on Chicago,"This book is amazing. It is, by far, the most complete compedium on all things Chicago that there is.Many of the entries are brief, but some major topics get full essay treatment. The section on architecture is a fantastic introduction to the architectural history of Chicago.This is an encyclopedia, and therefore it contains information on a huge range of topics, but is not exceptionally detailed. It does provide reference to related topics within the book, and it provides a number of sources for further reading.The book employees many excellent charts and maps, as well as a very thorough timeline on the history of this city.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves this great city and wants to know more."
1,This book is a disappointment,"As a market analyst for an oil company, I spend considerable effort in trying to find new ways and theories to ""decode"" the markets and overcome uncertainty. I had hoped Mr. Peters book would offer a model of analysis to test and hopefully use.Unfortunately, the deeper you get into the ""meet and potatoes"" of this text, the more disappointing it gets. This book offers nothing. Readers less skilled in the subject matter might attribute this to their shortcomings or lesser math skills. Readers well-versed in this subject matter will easily determine that this text is a waste of time..."
4,Mike Gayle does it again!,"Having been a student at Birmingham University at about the same time the story is set, this book hit sooooo... close to my heart.But even without the very personal points of reference I think this book is well worth a read - it's romantic (without being soppy), heartwarming, funny and down-to-earth. Four stars instead of five for being slightly predictable, but still massively enjoyable.Although I didn't end up marrying a University boyfriend, this book really made me want to call up and see how they are and recommend this book!"
4,good little chair for inside of play house,"This is a cute, small and comfortable chair that my daughter uses inside of her toy house. I marked it 4 stars for educational because she sits in it to read! So, thought the actual chair isn't ""educational"" it can be used for such pursuits...so it counts."
3,Toothless,"Joan Jett has taken the vicious, snarling debut album Dollyrots and turned them into an anonymous power pop band. Yes, Because I'm Awesome is entertaining and fun to listen to. But the raw spirit and conviction present on the first album is missing. BIA is way too smooth and polished.Great for corporate radio and perfect for Warped Tour, but miserable for fans of the original band. The spunky cover of Melanie's Brand New Key makes you realize what could have been.Joan, you were a pioneer and we will always love you. But please stop turning great bands into Clear Channel fodder."
3,Beware of censored version,"Great album, but the MP3 version substitutes the censored version of ""Desperate S.O.S."" There was and still is nothing in the description that Amazon is selling the edited version. Grooveshark has the uncensored version. Buyer beware."
4,Pop Punk Fun,"Pop Punk...here comes the Dollyrots. This is just a fun Cd sounding a lot to me like Avril Lavigne. My favorite cut, the catchy ""My Best Friend's Hot"". I like this group. They sound like they are having fun, and what's wrong with that!"
1,Worst Young Earth Book I've Read,"As an old earth creationist whose job it is to review young earth creationist material, I must say this is the worst young earth book I have ever read. The author takes a novel approach, in that he strictly uses emotion to argue for young earth creationism. The book is full of ""God of the Gaps"" type arguments. This type of argument says, ""It's a complex organism, so only God could have created it."" If something is beautiful, ""Only God could have created it."" If it cannot be explained, then ""God did it."" As a Christian, I agree with these statements, but they will never convince a non-Christian that ""God did it."" One gets tired of this emotional appeal very quickly.Other young earth creationist books are wrong...but at least they try to present facts to back up their case. The facts in this book are few, and are easily explained."
1,Frustrating,"MacArthur's book left me frustrated by his defense of creationism for several reasons.1. I felt that his entire argument was based on the ""because the Bible says so, no questions asked"" argument.2. The various authors, theologians and scientists that are referred to are portrayed in a very biased light. (e.g. desparaging remarks in regard to the work of Dr. Hugh Ross)3. MacArthur shows a very limited knowledge of the natural sciences that is made evident throughout the book.3. The entire book made a straw man of science and evolution.As a Christian, I am ready for intelligent conversation to occur in regard to the Creation v. Evolution debate. This book did not offer said conversation."
5,MacArthur's Discussion of Creation Superb,"As usual, John MacArthur addresses a subject very popular and controversial in today's world: creationism versus evolution. This is a great book for someone who wants to understand the theology behind the story in Genesis and needs to be ""armed"" to discuss it with secular scientists and/or agnostics and atheists."
5,Different take,This book had a major impact on my life all due to a very small section of the book. This book made me realize that I was spending too much time focused on animals and not enough on people.
1,"Evolution is a farce, but much in this book is too","I never expected such horrible scientific and biblical scholarship from Macarthur. That's what he gets for blindly following the young-earth movement. It is obvious that he made little or no attempt to test their claims. Like them, he falls into the hypocracy of quoting old-earth Intelligent Design theorists against evolution but then turns around and attacks their age of Earth which is based on the same science. You can't have it both ways, Macarthur. His misrepresentation of the Big Bang, a powerful ID proof, is so ridicoulous, it is as if a five-year old is writing the science. His misrepresentations of Dr. Ross are also ridicoulous (Did you even read his works, Macarthur?).This latest attempt by the dying young-earth movement is part of their last-ditch effort in saving their groups. But like all other recent attempts, it will backfire due to is poor scholarship and continue to bring shame on Christianity."
3,More of an equipment guide than a training manual,"Lauck places a heavy emphasis on equipment in this book and talks very little about deployment and tactics. Not only does he emphasize equipment but absolute top-of-the-line custom-built one-of-a-kind equipment.I think that most precision rifle scenarios could be resolved with something less than the equipment that Lauck describes in this book. I suspect that with proper deployment an expert rifleman with high-quality factory-made equipment would be able to resolve the issue.The book does not address the questions ""when is the tactical marksman the right tool for the job"" or ""how should a tactical marksman deploy"" in any depth.Lauck really does seem to have an extensive knowledge of precision shooting equipment. But I would not call the book a ""complete training manual."""
3,Okay Book,"This is an okay book, but outdated at this point. Not quite sure of the publication date, but it feels like it's making new revelations that were common a decade ago."
5,24 ways fo looking at a piano,"Just to say I think that this is a well put together concept, plus it is musical."
4,Great Wind Ensemble,"This is a great collection of some great wind ensemble pieces. My review may be a little weighted, since I consider the Fisher Tull Piece ""Sketches On a Tudor Psalm"" to be one of the best wind ensemble pieces written. The chords and rhythyms keep that piece incredibly interesting. This is a nice mix, and i really enjoy it. I would definately reccomend owning it, especially since a few of the pieces on here can be a little hard to come by, especially at such a quality of recording."
4,Well written,"Excellent for explaining the practical side of the business. Has enough examples to give you a first cut at understanding M&A. Not a great valuation book, but then it doesn't profess to be."
2,shouldn't a historical novel have history?,"I have to agree with Juan Depaz. I have done some amateur historical research on the period (I published a study of Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera which received good reviews in Spain) and the vision that Yarbro has of the Civil War and what led to it is plain ridiculous. Somehow she wanted the atmosphere so that she could hang her tale, never mind how it meshed with reality.(That reminds me that, never mind how much I enjoyed The Palace, Savonarola never conducted an auto-da-fe).I am also irritated by the frequency in which priests, monks, and other members of the Church tend to be ignorant and despicable villains. Yarbro should get off her anti-Christian kick."

5,Battery Minder is the best !,"I all ready have saved a battery, I have told many of my customers about this product. I am very happy with the purchase, delivery, and quality of my purchase. Amazon has it all at a great price."
5,WORKS AS ADVERTISED,"REVIVES MOST SULPHATED BATTERYS GOOD FOR MOTORHOMES,DIESEL TRUCKS(MY ONE YEAR OLD f350 BATTERIES]HOWEVER WILL NOT EQUALLY DESULPHATE DIFFERENT TYPES- STARTING AND DEEP CYCLE BATTERIES AT THE SAME TIME- AS IN A MOTORHOME USE ON EACH TYPE SEPARATELY OR BUY TWO-WILL NOT BOIL OFF WATER IN CELLS AS SOME CHARGERS WILL- I USE IT ON MY MOTORHOME,TRUCK EVEN REVIVED MY LAWNMOWER BATTERY AS IT IS ADJUSTABLE FOR BATTERY SIZE AND TYPE- PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST AND YOU WILL BE SATISFIED."
5,Saved my batteries,"I have 5 large truck batteries in the Motohome and 4 large batteries in my diesel pick-ups. It has radically improved the perfomance of them all...great product. The whole theory sounds like a lot of hogwash, but it sure works!!!"
4,Nice product!,"Love this little charger and have used it to bring my AGMs in my large truck back to life by desulfating them. Only downside is it does not do 24v, so have to do one battery at a time, or parallel them. Also keeps my tractor's battery well charged throughout the time it sits."
5,You can't do everything,"I have every book in this series. This one is a good book to show little ones that not every one can do it all. When my little one is too small to do something, this one shows that Mr. Putter can't learn to play the horn. His friendly neighbor does, but he is happy in the end. Get the whole series and enjoy. My 4 year old loves them, but secretly, I bought them for myself."
4,T-Shirt,"T-Shirt fabric was very good quality, screening was well done and seller sent merchandise immediately and in time for the Christmas gift it was intended to be."
2,For Completists especially,"Probably the epitome of P-Funk's mid-eighties electro-funk period, BWOTD features lots of drum machines and a profoundly less organic feel than what we're used to. For the most part, it doesn't sound like most of the earlier P-Funk music and we can see why it wasn't released originally in the eighties. In addition to the sound -- the songwriting is not impressive.Every big-time fan of Parliament-Funkadelic should own this (they probably already do) but I can't recommend it to the music-buying public in general."
4,Empowers women with trust in their bodies to give birth.,"Laura Kaplan Shanley shares her personal journey of self-discovery in thisbook which educates women about their bodies' natural instincts inchildbirth. She shares many quotes from the books which inspiredher to trust her body's ability to birth. Shanley demonstrates therole of psychology in the perception of pain. Through dream interpretation,meditation, and mental mantras, she shows the ability to gain controlin situations which many may deem uncontrollable. It seems to haveworked well for her, although I question if it would be suitable forall women, because of the immense energy and faith which onemust exert in order to achieve what Shanley has. This book notonly applies to childbirth, but also to the spiritual nature of life in general and theimpact that it can have on our destiny"
4,Pretty good encouragement,"This book is really good encouragement and does an excellent job of sharing the real facts about the problems of medical system. Whether you actually plan on an unassisted birth or just want information about the truth, this is a good book to have in your library. I was somewhat distraught at her bias against Christianity, but I can understand that she was opposed to the religious practices and not to the spirituality concept behind Christ."
5,"Powerful, Affirming, and Inspiring","In this book, Laura Shanley has single-handedly started a revolution, and once you have read it, there is no going back. In clear, confessional and honest prose, she tells the story of her own unassisted births and explores the mind-body-spirit connection not only as it related to childbirth, but as it relates to the human experience. Her message is clear: women are the experts when it comes to their bodies and their births, and there is no one - doctors, midwives, partners - who can do it better. She makes a powerful case for autonomous birth, and this book, if nothing else, will force you to think out of the obstetric box. If every woman in America (heck, all over the world!) got her hands on this book, we would have a calmer, more centered, and much more peaceful society where women take back the power that is inherently theirs - the power of birth."
4,This book helped change my life for the better.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It enabled me to make a paradigm shift from the average modern medical mindset. So, that I was able to birth my baby at home in the safest most loving environment possible. I thank God that I found this book. I learned so much."
1,Questionable at best,"This book is fine for some women, who would be fine going through a pregnancy alone and birthing alone. But it propounds that ALL women SHOULD go through pregnancy alone and this is where the author goes too far. There are many illnesses that are easily treatable that if left untreated as this author recommends, will result in great illness or death for the mother and/or baby. I would investigate thoroughly before believing the feel~good message this book tells. It is a simple fact, doctors save lives, medicine saves lives. Follow this book at your own risk."
2,A Disappointment...,"The book is geared towards those with a basic understanding of the Russian alphabet and pronunciation in order to use it. If you have no understanding of the Russian language, do not buy this book. I suggest you sign up for a language class or a more comprehensive Berlitz course. This book is not for amateurs even though it is written in a very simple and concise format."
2,Not what it seems,I bought this brush for my finishing powder but every time i use it i get a face full of hair! It sheds horrendously.
1,Oh no!,"Sorry to say but the previous reviewer was correct. This really is one of the worst films ever made. I can't catalogue everything which is wrong with this but believe me it has no redeeming factors.A real pity after quite enjoying ""Gang of Roses"", another ""new wave"" urban western. On this one however - save your money."
1,awful,"this movie was so low budget...omg...hate i wasted my money on it...the movie was in good condition, but ugh, the story line was horrible!!!"
1,This movie is TRASH!!!,"This is a ridiculous movie, was a very silly story line. Not to mention that it is EXTREMELY POORLY done. If I had to guess, I would think that the total budget for this disaster of a movie is $212. Don't waste your time."
4,ok,"I purchased this as a add on for a train set, The pieces are attractive and look durable. Will need to see how they hold up[ to being played with"
1,Not worth your money!,This book was a complete waste of my time. The only reason that I read it was because it was part of my class assignment. There were many times when I wanted to throw this piece of crap across the room. Often I would become confused as to what was happening. It was like spontaneously things would happen without any explanation. The ending was STUPID. I never want to hear or see this book ever again!
2,Grandson not excited,"I ordered this as part of a set of three Bruder construction toys for my 3-yr-old grandson. We set up a sandbox for him. He loves Bob the Builder characters, but their toys were matchbox size and not rated highly. After reading other reviews of construction toys, I thought these would be great. They do not have as many moving parts as described in reviews. The roller on this drum doesn't turn around in sand nor do any of the toys have enough heft and weight for outside use. When visiting, my grandson plays with them very briefly but can't get much realistic play out of them. I would have returned them, but they are already dirty."
4,Good quality,"We bought several Bruder vehicles for Christmas. This was one of the more reasonably priced ones, and it is smaller -- that is a good thing as some of them are just too big for our home. Well-made, made in Germany, and safe. Only draw back is it doesn't have lights or sounds, and my son seems to be attracted to that, but this one should last for years."
5,Great for Truck Fans,This is a fantastic toy steam roller for any kid who loves to play with trucks or construction toys. It's very durably made so you don't have to worry about it getting broken quickly. Perfect for indoor or outdoor play!
4,A scanty topic is finally pinned down,"I found this book a pleasure to read as it described the aspects of warfare in ancient Egypt in a clear and consistant manner. Although a lot of work has to be done in this subject, this is definately a good start for any student or interested reader."
1,AVOID - Would Not Support,"I bought Version 2.0 (2005) in anticipation of getting rid of an old PC. You put the CD in the bay, and it boots up in Linux from the CD, but it would get to an uncompress step and try to find something in my empty 3.5 diskette drive and just hang. Their only response was ""we no longer support that version, but you can have 30% off our new version"" Yo jerks, that sucks. Do not support this company. Looks like my drive will get the old hammer treatment."
3,Stuhrling men's Normandy watch,"This is a nice looking watch, however it is a liitle thick, and tends to run fast. I have had to set the time back by about 5 minutes after 2 weeks."
3,Confusion over 2 books with same title.,"As a school librarian, I think people should know that Robb White and D.R. Sherman both wrote a book called Lion's Paw. White's book is about South Florida and three children sailing. I haven't read either, but have seen White's book. Sherman's book is about ""a young African boy who frees a lion from a trap and must face the difficulties of loving and losing a wild thing."" (Something About the Author, vol. 29, p. 192). I gave it a neutral 3 stars. I didn't want people to be disappointed when they ordered Sherman's book and found out it had a different story line. White's book is also available here at Amazon.com."
3,Quality adapter,This is a very high quality product.The length of it does cause a vignette if you don't telephoto a little bit. It has to be this long due to how far the camera lens extends when you go to telephoto mode.
3,"Excellent Quaker instruction, mediocre crime mystery","As a British Quaker, this book was of considerable interest to me. The picture it portrays of American Quaker life was a surprise in some ways - the intensity of the faith and the faithfulness of daily behaviour struck me as extremely 'other worldly'. Elizabeth is a likeable woman, and concern for her kept me reading. However, the actual mystery was very predictable almost from the first, and the somewhat contrived accumulation of accident, would-be suicide and ultimate detection is not especially well structured. It is, however, courageous to write about murder amongst Quakers, and the Peace Testimony is very well explored, in the light of imperfect human beings, and their capacity for sin and self-deception. Rebecca Tope"
1,I am a Quaker,"One of the things I like about the Society of Friends is that no one can claim to speak for it, and that includes me. However, I have found all this author's works to be different from any Quakerism I've experienced. It's possible that she's speaking from real experiences that I don't share, but I wince to think that we're being encountered through these books by people who will never encounter us in any other way."
1,"Save your money, read the Bible instead","This book is specifically meant for but not suitable for children. The October 1 entry is a story about a young girl who shares an ugly secret about something her uncle did that made her feel dirty. I'll let you guess the rest.Aside from the fact that this story is completely inappropriate for children, there is absolutely no connection between it and the quoted verse in Mathew 11: 28-30We chucked our book in the garbage."
5,Great book,This book is awsome! It has real life senarios to relate to the kids about God! My kids and I love it!
1,This is just horrible,"Nothing can replace the real Bible, and they come up with all these stupid stories that end with lines like, ""You shall be punished, son."" This is the craziest book ever written!!! Save your money."
1,Theratears Single-Use packaging difficult to use in eye,"This was the first time that I have purchased Theratears Individual containers, but I found them very frustrating. First of all, you nearly poke your eye when you try to use them; and secondly, when you first open one you cannot squeeze the lubricant out very easily. I will never buy them again!!!"
2,get out your hearing aid,This phone simply is not loud enough. I can hardly hear the other party when I adjust it to maximum volume.
4,Panasonic KX-FG2451 plain paper fax/copier phone & answer,The product works well. It was quick and easy to set up. The messages on the answering machine are clear and understandable. It does not take up alot of space since it is compact and attractive.
3,Panasonic KX-FG2451 Phone/Fax/Answer Phone/Copier,"The unit is compact and puts phone,answering machine, fax and copier all in one place. Only draw back for me is that the incoming message volume is very low, so it is very hard to tell who is calling. Also, unlike previous Panasonic units I have owned, it does not have Talking Caller ID, again making it difficult to screen calls. The unit itself though functions very well."
3,works fine but......,"It does the job but the speaker in the answering machine playback is so tiny that it is very hard to understand. To bad because otherwise it is a good machine. Unfortunately, combo fax/answering machines are hard to find nowdays so you' re stuck with this one. As I said, it does the job but the playback feature has such poor audio it is very hard to understand.Then, the cordless phone is small and awkward to hold and the buttons are to damned small for a normal sized westerner to use.I bought this to replace the previous generation model that quit working consistently after years of use. The features on this one are easier to use but the overall quality doesn't match the old one.To bad."
1,Lousy Fax - ZERO STARS!!!,I would never buy another fax machine from Panasonic.You can't get this one to move the paper when it is in fax mode. It holds very little paper and the film runs out very quickly. I'd take this back to the store if I had not purchased it on line. The is the worst fax machine I have ever purchased. Don't buy this one. I'd love to ship it back!!!
4,owner,Panasonic KX-FG2451 Plain Paper Fax/Copier with 2.4GHz FHSS GigaRange Cordless Phone and Digital Answering SystemIt is excellent machine for regular use. Ribbons are expensive. Cordless phone and other features for Fax machines are easy to use.
2,negative,The screen on the cordless phone hasn't worked right from day one and the Panasonic people couldn't care less!
2,waste waste waste,"I made the mistake of buying a Panasonic fax machine that uses ink film. The images are good and the phone features are OK. But boy do they waste ink film!!!! We live in a lighting prone area and have to unpug often. Every time you turn this unit back on, or make a copy, or print a fax, it simply chows ink film. And, of course, it always seems to run out without warning right when you are about to print a very critical document. Well over half of my last roll was unutilized. Waste, waste, waste. Did Panasonic design this machine to advance film unnecessarily and thus force people to buy their expensvie film rolls more often? Well, they helped me to advance to another brand. Incidentally, at my office I still have an old thermal Panasonic phone/fax that works great. It was a real quality unit."
4,Grossly Under-Rated Musical,Nick & Nora is a terrific soundtrack. The Broadway production was wonderful....too bad the critics killed it.
5,Great Fun,"Nick and Nora was a victim of bitter critics looking to pan a greatly anticipated musical. At least we have the cast recording to remember to of it's glory by. Joanna Gleason is perfect and sings with style and wit. Barry Bostwick has a nice voice, but the real star of this recording is Faith Prince singing ""Men"" a bitter diatribe against chauvenism."
2,"Not exactly a ""TruView""","I bought these at a local Napa for my '87 Volvo 740 and am now looking to replace them after only a few months. They are NOT very bright. In fact every other car on the road casts a shadow in my light. My old Sylvania basics were brighter. DO NOT even try to drive in the rain, at night. I gave it two stars because they work to a point. Better save this before I move it down to one star..."
3,pleasant,"This book is set in modern times, with a bit of magic and a few fantastic creatures added. Two of the three main characters are particularly interesting: an old man who is experiencing dimensia, and a compulsive middle aged man who discovers that some of his habits are magical spells. The third main character is not: the old man's loving granddaughter, whose attitudes regarding her live-in boyfriend are distasteful and selfish.The plot follows these three, who eventually confront an evil creature in Europe. The plot is internally consistent, characterization nicely done, and the overall mood pleasant. ""Caves of Buda"" is an enjoyable read, worthwhile but not ""can't put it down""."
4,A worthy effort,"A good book about the lovely and wonderful Diana though perhaps not the best I've ever read. Still, those of us who truly loved and admired this wonderful woman will want to read it.To the ""Reader From Oxford England"" whose nasty review appeared above: Why bother to share your vapid and meaningless thoughts? My suggestion for you is to go and find other Diana-bashers, such as that two-faced Robert Fellowes, and have a great big BLOW-FEST with one another!!"
4,Food Info,Good source of info about mood and food ---- how we are effected by the foods we eat. It is a short book and I ordered it with several other books about food addiction.
2,Needs An Update and More Evidence Based Research,"This book is not very different than the first edition. It's good for helping you identify potential links between food and mood. HOWEVER, it's not based in the most sound research. I'd love to see an update."
2,Left With The Blahs!,"I was disappointed in this movie. The acting was lacking professionalism. I bought it for a grandson, but there is too much competition on the children's market of quality movies, that this one will be left in the dust! I bought it not know the quality of the production and acting, so can't really blame just the movie! The character, Rupert Patterson, has a creative imagination I'll grant that, but the era was as it says on the cover, a cross between The Wonder Years, and Home Alone... of a lesser quality!"
5,A poet artist,"The thing that impressed me about this CD is that, not only are the tunes so varied, but the ideas expressed in the lyrics are alternately profound, humorous, ironic, joyful, sad, and are always poetic and prolific. The more I listen to the ""songs of Solomon"", the more they grow on me. I think Solomon is brilliant."
3,"Good concept, too superficial","I liked the concept behind this book but found the selections were rather shallow. The book did manage to get across the message that no one is perfect, which is fine, but it did not really explore issues in an in-depth way. It simply did not do justice to the constant and often heart-renching questioning that characterizes parenting.I was hoping to be probed on difficult (ultimately unanswerable) questions such as: am I doing this right? what does ""right"" mean, anyway? how can I forgive myself for my mistakes, both real and perceived? what does my child feel about my imperfect parenting? what can I affect or change and what do I need to just let go? to what extent do I really have control at all? in what ways do I just need to chill out? how can I be more tolerant and flexible? etc, etc. I was hoping for a much richer exploration of these types of questions.I found the stories somewhat entertaining but not very substantive."
2,A Disappointment,"I read this book with my book club and all of us were disappointed. We all have elementary aged or younger children and we were looking forward to using these stories as a springboard for discussions about motherhood. Although there were a few stories that were truly interesting, many were extremely annoying. Yes, these mothers shared an embarrassing moment or two, but also spent quite a bit of time making sure the reader knew what an overachieving, nearly perfect mom she really is. To the overachieving mothers who shared their stories I say, ""Good for you!"" but I wish I hadn't wasted my money and time on your book."
5,Love it,"I read this while pregnant with my second child. It helped me learn that there are lots of ""imperfect moms"" out there and that I am not the only one. Sometimes you are so busy comparing yourself to all of your friends that make it look so easy, but then you realize that NO MOM is perfect...this is a great, short, easy read."
4,Inner Reiki is a dynamic book,"Inner Reiki combines the 2 venerable modalities of Reiki and in-depth meditation. Also this book is a lot of fun! When I enjoy the dancing, I feel more in tune with the song of the uni-verse."
1,healing guide,This focus on healing and meditation with the beautiful color illustrations is so very helpful to more understand the aspects of Reiki.
3,Rich in technical detail and illustrations.,"This book covers all the bases in detail, assuming that the reader has at least a working knowledge of electrical theory, physics, and acoustics. You don't have to have a degree, just reasonable familiarity with the subjects. The chapters are well written, and laid out in a very logical order. The book includes many charts, graphs, and illustrations to support the text. A must read for the novice speaker builder."
1,Too basic to be useful,"The author covers a variety of subjects but too lightly to be useful. Too much effort is spent on things that are useless. For example, Testing of Loudspeakers - part of the book's title - is barely 13 pages and is so basic as to not allow tuning of cabinet design. Rather this section focuses on determining specifications that speakers already come with. Suggestion of using PVC piping for ducts and asphalt paper for damping really remove any credibility for a successful high fidelity outcome using these techniques. Pictures of a hammer over a brad and a ruler on a woofer kind of tells it all. Many pages taken up with basic programming print outs - stuff that's available in Windows format free on the internet now. Horn designs are not covered and the project section only has a couple of basic designs. That said, the author does a great job telling you how to make inductors for cross-over networks.I was done with this 200 page book in about 1 hour. Rather dissapointing."
2,Who is this book written for?,"I am a complete beginner at speaker building. I have the necessary woodworking skills but I wanted to be able to choose a set of drivers and build a box for them. I could not do that after reading this book.Too much was written on simplistic subjects and the more complicated subjects were only quickly touched on. Rather than starting with simple mathmatical examples, the examples are intermixed with multiple options. The book left me wondering how anyone could ever wade through the hopelessy complex process and build a set of speakers."
1,"Too simple, only for newbies!","This book is quite a simple (and sometimes unusefull) introduction to design/build Speaker System.Design principles are old and it does not cover new trends such as implementation of spice models and simulation.Maybe only source code (written in BASIC for DOS!) can be interesting for an absolute beginner, ... eventhough it's cheap, save your money!"
3,"Good for some, not so good for others.....","This book may be a little complicated for begginers into the audio world. Also don't be fooled by the name of the book, this book does NOT tell you how to design and make speakers, rather, speaker systems. As in, 4-5 speakers and a subwoofer. Although, this book does touch on why speakers do certain things, along with distortions, and all those little goodies that rob you of true quatlity! It will also help you on designing different types of enclosures for all audio."
3,LIttle hard to get round,"Maybe it's my lack of knowledge with the whole area of speaker design but I thought that the book was a little dated to start with. Additionally, I felt that the whole part on determining the characteristics of the speaker driver was unnecessary as most drivers come with this data. Perhaps pointing this out with less coverage would have been good. The book covers determing box size and vented boxes rather well but falls down in the projects section which is basically a list of ideas. I would have liked to see the book focussing more on designing boxes with multiple drivers etc. Maybe it's because the book is so dated that it like that. And please, loose the BASIC programs!"
1,poorly written,"This book is meant for people who have studied Mathematics for most of their lives. The formulas are not for a beginner, the designs left much to be desired.the Information from the Technical tables found within would be useful if you have a college degree in math......i was not all that pleased..however, at the time i could not locate the Radio shack speaker design book. That only happened after I purchased this book.Dave"
2,Kind of usless a few good projects,The science of acoustics cannot be explained so briefly. It zips through very important things and doesn't go in depth enough. It will give your some tips for basic designs but there is no way you can walk away from this book to design a top notch speaker enclosure. By all means you can copy the projects in the book but I don't feels its worth my money. Many other pre-designed enclosures are available for free. Its just to brief.
2,What`s inside?,"The book is good for somebody who just starts his path in the loudspeaker building. However it is too common, does not have any specific information. It will help you to construct a low end loudspeaker, nothing fancy. If you`re looking to build something good with more expensive drivers and if you have high expectations about he sound, this book won`t help you at all."
1,Enormously disappointing.,"This book reads more like an infomercial for some glyconutrient supplement product than a thorough and interesting survey of the subject. Most of the information is based on anecdotes, is poorly organized and there is not much depth. Not much research cited to support the claims. What is presented is not tied to the reader in a relevant, useful way-factoids without any clear way to employ them to better one's health. I'd like to contrast this with the horribly titled but nevertheless amazing Fats That Heal Fats That Kill by Udo Erasmus. I was hoping this book would be similar in scope, relevance, and quality but it does not even come close."
5,Amazing reading!,"This book is amazing, I couldn't put it down. Powerful reading. I would reccommend it to anyone looking for answers to health and wellbeing issues."
1,This book is a failure,"I thought this book will provide practical tips on how to improve my style, but I found it just another copy of William Strunk ""The Elements of Style."" Bryan did not go for extra mile and try to provide real examples or reveal his experience as he claims the ""Editor in Chief of Blakc's Law Dictionary.""I so disappointed with this purchase."
5,Better than factory blocks.,These are a nice change since they are self lubricating and make the saw a little more quite and anything helps.
3,Check your style,"These blocks did not work on my 12"" Sears bandsaw, like it said it would. My blocks were round not square like these. I will say though, that the company was GREAT when it came to returning them, no hassle!!! I am not blaming this mixup on them as I could have looked myself."
3,Retrospect Back-Up,"Most importantly, USE DVDs to back-up - took way too long & more than 25 CDs. And, now, I'm kind of lost of how and when to edit or update my back-up. I was prompted by David Lawrence (WGN radio) to purchase & install, but for a home personal computer, I think that this is just too much. The $$$ was a bit high, but the labor, CDS, time and confusion was just WAY TOO HIGH. Not real satisfied. Linda Hoffman, Mokena, Illinois"
2,difficulties with Retrospect 7,"I bought Retrospect because of the review in PC magazine. However, it is difficult to use because it uses jargon that I didn't know and which wasn't fully explained early in the manual. I wanted a backup program that would help me if my hard disk crashed, and I'm not sure that this program supplies that. After doing the backup, the program prints out a few sheets that one is supposed to use in case of disaster. Being reluctant to test such a scenario, one is left with a large uncertainty."
5,I am happy with this book..,"My son like this book, he is having a good time while learning. I believe is a very practical book for an eight graders"
5,8th grade reading comprehension,"It is a very effective, well organized workbook that divides the sections to encourage manageable study."
3,"Good material, formatting could be better","The content is good, but it would be better if all the answers were at the back of the book, instead of at the end of each chapter. I give the book to my son to work on, and I don't want him to be tempted by the answers and I need to be able to remove the answers and keep them myself."
5,Great Book For Improving Reading and Writing Skills,"I bought this book for my 7th grader to use next year, but like it so much I'm going to adapt it for her older brother. It uses critical reading to understand how paragraphs and essays are put together, then uses those skills to create different types of essays. I love that they have an online practice center with immediate scoring, detailed explanations of the answers, and recommendations for further practice tailored to each individual student. It also shows the student how to study: skimming, highlighting, looking for clues in the text, recording student comments and questions...all the things a local college recruiter told me she wished were still covered in high school. The only thing I wish the publisher had done differently is not put 8th grade on the cover, because I think this book is also useful for high school students."
5,All the great episodes in one DVD!,Mermaid man and Barticle Boy III is probably my favorite episode... all the episodes on this compilation are GREAT! Wonderful viewing if you're a spongebob fan.

5,"sardines, tabasco, onion and swedish rye bread","Sardines, Tabasco, onions on a Swedish Rye Bread is an acquired, but delicious. Of course, you get to drink a beer with that."
4,My Favorite,"I eat a lot of sardines because of my diet. This is my favorite combination, and it is priced well. Good sardines with ust the right amount of tomato sauce."
4,Cheaper than the Local Grocery,Not all cans are created equal. I think some of these can's have sat for awhile while other's are fresh and delicious. Overall I'm satisfied but could not give it 5 stars for this reason.
2,A Disappointment in Tommy,"I was looking forward to a great big band sound, but was very diasppointed in what this CD contained. Although the band has some great musicians EVERY track is a vocal! The band is an afterthought it seems. Every once in awhile you get to hear the band swing, but the main feature seems to be the vocalist who, frankly sounds like some lounge singer who wound up on the band stand. If you're looking for a swinging big band CD, avoid this one!"
3,I Perfer the Pilot G2,"I used BIC Velocity Gel pens until I found a better ""GEL"" pen about two years ago... The Pilot G2 Retractable Gel Ink Roller Ball Pen. The black ink is darker, provides a more natural cushioned grip, and does not clog or skip in my experience. The BIC Velocity Gel pens skip and clog too often. I do not recommend the BIC Velocity Gel pens."
1,Be Careful -- Bad product description,"The photo shows 6 keychains, but this is actually for only 1. The product description hints this. Once you go to buy, you'll read in the description that it is, in fact, for only one keychain -- with the description in the small print."
2,Duro-Med Disappointment,"Although this grabber has an excellent magnet, the product will not pick up any object that has a smoothly polished or slick surface, like a glossy magazine or small procelain bowl. This is because the claw clamps down on a strip of plastic instead of on a strip of rubber, like other reachers I've had. Even though the plastic strip is serated, many objects slip out of it. Also, the little hook at the base is slightly too high to easily snag many common objects."
4,essential item,"My mother got one of these when she broke her hip,so I knew I'd need it when I broke my leg. You can pick things up from all those places you can't reach from your wheelchair. I haven't tried it yet on the the wine bottle my husband ""hid"" on the top shelf of my kitchen cupboard. Do I have chance?"
5,Works like a charm. Couldn't live without it.,"I use one in the garage for picking up my four dog's multitude of toys scattered about. I purchased an extra one for inside the house. It can pick up a dime, a nail, the dog treat that fell behind the freezer, and some pretty disgusting things the dogs bring in on occasion.I've already purchased one as a gift for my vertically challanged sister-in-law. Lots of bang for the buck."
1,a shame,"I have this reacher for 5 tears. It is great, indispensable. SO I ordered another one. But this new one is junk. I checked with manufacturer Duro-Med and they concurred that they are being made by monkeys that dont know what they are doing. This reacher is junk now, a piece of worthless trash. At one time it was the best."
4,Helpful reacher,"I am using this to help me in the garden. It won't lift really heavy things but helps me pull up the hose to move it, etc. It is lite which is nice. Haven't had it long enough to know how durable it is. It uses a nylon cord to pull the claw, and I wonder how long this will last. But so far I am pleased with it."
2,magnetic tip....NOT!!!,"If you order this because you'd like to have a reacher with a magnetic tip, forget it....it doesn't work. Sure wish they'd try them out themselves before they sell them to the public."
1,flimsy pick up stick,This does not pick up as it is suppoosed to do - Very frustrating when one needs to pick up an item - especially paper or letter etc.Also the cord that is supposed to assist with opening claw breaks or becomes too loose--it does not stand up to normal use. I am disappointed as I thouoght it vwould improve the quallity of my daily living.
2,Will not p/u heavier items,"I am not satisfied with this grabber. After using my neighbors grabber after I got out of knee surgery, I ordered this one, that looked just like my neighbors. However this one will not pick up the heavier items such as a pillow or towel without dropping it. I believe the problem here compared to my neighbors are two things. First off the tip of this grabber is made of hard plastic as opposed to a rubber tip, therefore making things slide right out. Number two, my neighbors grabber has a wire cable from the trigger to the tip whereas this one is with a string, and stretches when you clamp on to a heavier item. I am returning this and have found another on Amazon that has 5 star reviews and a steel cable with rubber tips."
2,Minimally helpful,"I'm not a big fan of this grabber/reacher. I thought it would be great to have a magnet on the end/tip, but that's one feature I have never used.It's difficult/impossible to pick up items that are flat on the floor--for example, it's nearly impossible to pick up a piece of paper or a coin. The part of the grabber that comes in contact with the item doesn't hold tightly enough to hold the item, especially if the item weighs much more than a box of Kleenex. I was not able to pick up an empty ceramic cat food dish; the grabber doesn't work if the item doesn't have a big lip or weighs too much. Even a throw pillow was too heavy for this grabber.For items where the grabber 'hands' can completely encircle the item and it doesn't weigh too much, then it works just fine.I have found that the foldable, 36"" grabber with flexible rubber tips (they are shaped like small suction cups) tends to work very well. New Star Pro Aluminum Reacher and Grabber"
1,Barely usable,"I bought three of these to augment two reachers I had purchased previously, thinking they were the same. As previous reviewers noted, the string breaks easily under pressure, in my case because the tiny metal clip at the end which prevents the string from sliding through the hole in the jaw comes off. My previous reachers had a longer, thicker string with a knot at the end to serve the same purpose. (On one of the three reachers, the plastic jaw itself broke under pressure, but that was probably my fault; I was trying to pull on my shoe instead of using a shoe horn.) Finally, the fact that the jaw will slip to the side at the slightest sideward pressure and lose its grip makes it extremely frustrating to use to fasten Velcro fasteners on my shoes and sandals."
2,Item was OK until the string broke,"The ""Reacher"" worked just fine UNTIL the string BROKE"" -- now the only thing it is good for is picking up small metal items with the magnetic tip (good idea).They should reinforce the spot where the string attaches to the aluminum AND use a stronger string, perhaps some type of fishing line.With this problem, I could not recommend it."
2,Grabber,This item does not indicate that it is a folding grabber and the picture doesn't show it either. Not exactly made well and the packageing was terrible. It was two ends of a box taped together and was falling apart when it arrived. Was not pleased at all.
2,didn't work out of the box,"I give this product two stars because it did not work for what I intended it to, which was to move things onto a high shelf. Any time I borrow my family's gripper, it works extremely well- this one that I bought from amazon did not. When I opened it up, the rope that pulls the mechanism was too loose and therefore the grip was worse than that of a toy claw machine. I ended up having to jerry-rig a safety pin onto the rope itself just to tighten the grip. Now it works slightly better, but is still very difficult to use. I can't get things like stuffed animals onto high shelves because everything ends up slipping. It's frustrating because I know what a good gripper is supposed to feel like. I feel like this one left me with a lot to be desired. I would not recommend you buy this."
3,Not Made For Small Hands,"The trigger and the handle are too far apart making it awkward to use, especially for my mother. Other than that, it's a well made product."
5,Nice,"Bought this for my sister after some surgery. She didn't really use it, but it sure was entertaining. I am sure it will get used over the years in some way. High quality construction."
3,It has it's pros and cons,"All the grabbers are not very strong, although this one is stronger than the one that folds in half but it does not pick up something larger than about 4 inches. It is nimble and can grab items the other grabber's can't. It can lift heavier items more so than the suction cup grabber's."
3,Ok reacher,I have two reachers and they both do well but this one can pick up things my other cannot. Had to have it repaired once as I used it pretty hard after a hip replacement.
2,Aluminum Reacher,I was not happy with this product because it does not open wide enough to pick up common items such as jars. It would be of no use to me at the grocery store as I am trying to reach items up above me.
4,Reacher,"It is okay. I have in my possession a reacher purchased from North Coast medical, Incorporated, 20 years ago. It seems much sturdier than the new one I just purchased, but I'm still happy with the purchase."
4,Good for the price,"[...] I'm pretty satisfied. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good. I'm 5'7 and I would say that the shorter device (around 26"") would be way too short. This will work well for items that are not super heavy and slippery."
1,Difficult to use,The design of this grabber makes it very difficult to use. The reasons are (1) pincher end does not rotate so you must twist your wrist and arm instead (2) end 'pincher' design does not grab items as firmly and easily as the other designs where the pinchers are the same size (sort of like tweezers (3) the grip trigger is stiff. I definitely would not recommend this product.
5,A great product,The Dirp-med reacher is a little longer than the old one we had and the magnet on the end is very helpful. It is easy to use and picks up even small items easily.
2,Chewed up,Chewed up. Looked very very used. It broke. Internal string was worn-out. We had to repair. Not sure why this was sold as new.
5,Husband loves it!,I bought this for my husband and he loves it. Uses it almost every day.He has problems reaching over to get items off the ground. The reacher with the magnetic tip makes it so easy for him to use. He loves it and uses it constantly! Recommend this item to anyone who wants it.
1,Don't buy this One,"This grabber is useless unless you only want to pick up pins. It is good for that. I bought four of these two years ago, because I need a grabber in every room. The grip is even hard for me to use. I was cleaning out a closet and found them all. I can't throw anything away, so I am sending them to Goodwill. I really like the Pikstik. The short one fits in my carry on when traveling. If I could give this no stars, I would. I paid less than seven dollars for mine two years ago."
4,Super-duper reacher/grabber,This thing is great! I do have 2 others but this one is longer and helps me reach the back of my kitchen cabinets without having to stand on a stool or step ladder. Bad thing to do with a spinal disorder! I got my order lickety-split! Now still waiting for another item I ordered 3 months ago!!!!
4,Extra help,This product is great! I'm in a wheelchair and can't reach much so this comes in handy from the kitchen to the bedroom and everything in between. It can pick up about 4 pounds and can also retrieve pills off the floor and get clothes out of the closet. Well made and sturdy.
1,Disappointed!,"I inherited a reacher like this from my mother, and it gave both of us great service for over 15 years. This looked like the same product, so I expected similar durability and ease of use, and I even ordered one for a friend. However, the company must have changed suppliers, as the cords on both broke within a month of purchase. I was very disappointed, and would recommend considering another manufacturer's product instead."
1,not what I thought it would be,"I have previously had this type of product with the 2 rubber grippers at the bottom. Often, one side would lose the screw, the rubber would fly across the room, and it was useless. Thinking this was a magnetic reacher it would be better, I was surprised. When you grip the handle to actually pick up something, the gripper at the bottom isn't large or strong enough to do the job. So, it renders itself useless. I just bought another with the rubber grippers at the bottom!"
