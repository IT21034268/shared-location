3,"Fantastic, but not for beginners","If you don't have a lot of stumpwork or embroidery experience then I suggest this is not the book for you. While the designs are lovely and there are step by step instructions (and it is great value as it is two books combined in one), as a beginner myself I am now looking for something a little easier before tackling projects from this book again."
3,Not enough pictures!,"This is certainly a thick book for such a specific topic, so I was disappointed to discover so few pictures. Many are just hand-drawn diagrams, but there aren't even a lot of those! It definitely has valuable information, but for such a visual craft, you'd think they'd include more illustrations and photographs. Also, this book is not for a beginner embroiderer. It was fine for me, but I can see it being a bit confusing for someone who has no experience with general embroidery."
5,Wonderful and Painful,"A bout a year ago I spoke to Leonard Nimoy when he was doing his ""True selves"" photography book and I said to him that when I saw him in ""Vincent"" as a child I was blown away by his delivery of comedy and tragedy in one line. It's a complicated and powerful thing few performers can do. This is the second time I have seen it. I never knew Carrie Fisher had such an insane life and I must read the books now. Thank you so much for this Carrie. I am very sorry for your loss. You have inspired my wife and I and many of our friends in the industry over the years. You rock!"
4,Surprised.,"I like Carrie Fisher so I couldn't wait to see this! Unfortunately, and surprisingly, I was somewhat bored. As a one woman show, she's great - for a certain amount of time. After some time, I found myself yawning and didn't find her as witty and interesting as she comes across or as some of her novels. Overall, I liked it but I wished she had kept up her wittiness throughout the entire DVD!"
3,A little lackluster,"I haven't seen Carrie Fisher's ""Wishful Drinking"" performed live, but I have read the book, which I enjoyed very much. For me, the HBO version did not live up to my expectations. There were certainly some funny moments (including every second Fisher was wearing that Princess Leia wig), but for the most part I thought the show was kind of dry and even a bit monotone. I will say that the book contained more material, and it seemed to me that the HBO version may have been edited a bit, which may account for my dissatisfaction. I was planning to get tickets to see Fisher perform this show in Chicago later this year, and after watching this televised version, I am glad I didn't shell out the money."
5,Carrie Fisher is such a talent!,"I saw the play in a theater and was exhilerated to find that a DVD had been made. Carrie Fisher's sense of humor is slick, smart and honest, which for me makes a winning combination. I can't wait for her next writing endeavor!"
5,This is great stuff!,"It's hard to believe, but this one is even better than the first volume -- and twice as long. Every song on here has a terrific beat and heartfelt vocals. Latin pop music the way it should be."
2,Wallace Casino Stainless-Steel Flatware Set,I purchased my set of Wallace Casino Stainless-Steel Flatware and the first thing I noticed after a week or so was that the knives were pitting. I wrote to the company since this product has a 1 year warranty. They said I had washed them incorrectly. I explained that the flatware is supposed to be dishwater safe and the flatware was not washed in any way which voided the warranty. I did not hear from the company after that. I wrote again and they did not answer my letter. The set is beautiful but the knives have problems and the company will not honor their warranty. It is a shame too because as I said the set is beautiful but you cannot set a table with rusty pitted knives.
4,Happy in Chicago,"Great set of everyday flatware that compliments any set of dishes. You truly get your money's worth with this set and then some...it's very rare to find a set that contains soup spoons, a great added treat. A great set for a fantastic price. The 18/10 stainless steel makes this set very durable and it looks great on the table day after day...I have had this set for a few months now and continue to get compliments on it...you won't be disappointed."
1,Where's the beef?,I was disappointed to discover that the flatware set is stainless rather than silverplated. When I emailed customer service they apologized and said they no longer carried this item. Now I see it advertised again (only at a higher price!). Beware - I sent the set back over a month ago and have yet to receive a refund!
1,Not a very clear story,"Inside Convent Walls is a book who's author jumps from subject to subject, this bit of memory to that. Most of the little tidbits that she tells about are really those things where one had to be there to appreciate the moment. It is written in a terribly confused and jumbled way and I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,An interesting approach,"The author tries to tackle the subject of ceremonial magick without following the established rules and patterns.I agree with him that the search for simplicity is a good goal and that a lot of the traditional approach is more fluff than real. However, you can only take out certain parts from a machine before it stops working. So in his search for simplicity he tends to oversimplify certain concepts that are really important and may later create confusion on the beginner.I consider it a good book for the intermediate student, the one that already has done the rituals and now can compare the results by following this approach."
1,Possibly the worst KBLH book yet written,"If you can ignore the first thirty pages, which are really nothing much more than the author's rant against magical lodges, religious practitioners of KBLH (by any type) and the occult, there's actually some fairly decent material hidden away between the ravings.Unfortunately, its not much.Sam Weiser - we expect better from you."
5,"Wonderful, well-written collection of stories!","This is wonderful collection of stories based on Browning-Larsen's personal experiences in Asia--cerebral, sensitive, well-written and interesting!"
4,Great page-turner with spectacular finish,"To Kill an Eidolon introduces a new type of ""monster"" preying on seriously ill people. Eidolons aren't spirits or fairies or illusions, even though most people can't see them. They are visible to those whose genes let them see the right part of the spectrum. And they are very deadly.The story starts quietly and builds to a fantastic climax. The characters are all well-defined and believeable. The tension they are all under increases steadily from chapter to chapter. The characters are all stressed for different reasons, and all have individual reactions to that stress. The anguish of the character David is especially well depicted.The ending is very exciting. I'd love to tell you about it, but it would give away too much. All I can say is that it is a wonderful verbal description of what would be a wild special effect in a movie.This book would make a great movie, with strong characters and great effects. In the meantime, I can't wait for the sequel."
5,Amazing and attention keeping.,This book is amazing & I love it. I just can not share how this book kept me up until 1AM reading it! I always knew that cats were special. Now I know why ;).
5,The best there is...,"I was lucky to attend the live concert of El Nuevo Quinteto Real in El Club Del Vino in Buenos Aires in the summer of 2001, and the impression marked me for life. Make no mistake, these are the best Tango musicians of Piazzola's generation around. Their smoothness, their complete mastery of the material and flawless sense of style and tradition put them on a pedestal that most of the modern Tango performers have yet to reach. They are somewhat difficult to find and are not well known to the general public outside of Argentina. If interested, try to look them up by their names individually: Ubaldo de Lio, guitar; Horacio Salgan, piano; Nestor Marconi, bandoneon; Oscar Giunta, double bass; Hermes Peressini, violin. Good luck!"
4,This is a Good Book!,"Peter Shandy, a botanical expert, is on a mission in Pickwance, to discover a mystery about some lupines that are growing in an area where they usually do not. All goes well until one night when a local man, Jasper Flodge, dies while eating his dinner at the same Inn Peter is staying at. Over the course of a few days the restaurant is a busy place; full of new characters discovering the past of Jasper; trying to unravel the mystery of his untimely demise. It takes another murder and a great deal of gossip before Peter and his wife, whom he called to come help solve this mystery, to settle the case. This book is one that is full of suspense and thrills. There are many mini-plots that run through it to tie the entire novel into a unimaginable conclusion. This is a must read; one of Charlotte's pieces."
2,disappointed,"Douglas is a good brand, but i have not found this product to be effective and it's rather expensive. Sublingual doesn't seem to be any improvement on the relatively cheap Natural Bounty 3mg oral tablets i found at my grocery store while i waited for these to arrive, even if i take enough to make up the dosage difference (which, absorbed sublingually, should be more efficient). Would not recommend unless for some reason you can't take the oral version. I malabsorb nutrients and medications on top of everything, and still prefer my cheap orals."
5,The best movie of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Titanic the movie as well as its companion book which deals with the making of the movie are stunning accomplishments. Words alone cannot describe the hysteria that has engulfed any who have seen and actually appreciate what James Cameron as well as Leo and Kate Winslet(my personal favorite)have done to make this the all time best movie I have seen.
5,This book is beautiful and the and a must-read !!!!,This book is beautiful I absolutely love the colorful and elaborate pictures and facts.The recreation of the of world's great ocean-luxury-liner is amazing and it's the greatest movie of all time!!!!!!=)
4,This book is very informative!,"This book is for people that are fans of the Titanic movie and for those that are searching for answers about how James Cameron made the movie Titanic. I has a lot of pictures of all of the characters in the movie, not just Jack and Rose."
3,Love the movie? you'll love the book,"THat's the bottom line. If you hate the movie, you'll hate the book. ANd if you haven't seen the movie, well, the ship sinks.Sorry to ruin it for ya."
5,"If You Loved the MovieTitanic, You'll Love this Book!!",I got this book for my birthday and I absolutely LOVE IT!!There are tons and tons of picture both from the movie and behind the scenes. There's also exclusive pictures of the REAL titanic at the bottom of the ocean. The book details what went into making the titanic and quotes and pictures of the stars. Leonardo DiCaprio lovers should BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!
5,Titanic Rules,I've seen Titanic 3 times and am definently going to see it again. Titanic was so sad but also really good. Leo is sooooooooooooo hot and Kate is very pretty. I cry whenever I hear music or clips from the movie.
1,It's not what it seems.,"I skimmed through the list of people who wrote about this book, and all but maybe 3 people gave it 10. Truth is...it only gets 10 because Leonardo DiCrapio is in the movie. If it was some no-name loser, it probably wouldn't have been nominated for anything. The book itself is rather lame. All you have is pictures of the cast and crew looking pretty, and those stupid pictures that you've seen in every website, every poster. ENOUGH ALREADY."
3,Interesting but a bit of a disappointment,"Big movies tend to inspire big books on how a particilar film was made and ""Titanic"" is no exception. One only wishes the book had been a little richer in detail.As much as we learn about the production (a full scale Titanic was constructed, etc.) we're left with the impression that putting this film together was a massive undertaking but, overall, fairly routine. Absolutely no mention of the cost overruns, Paramount bailing Fox out at the last minute (and reaping all the rewards), ILM, Banned from the Ranch and other effects houses completing key FX work or James Cameron's fierce temper and its effect on the cast and crew around him.But, after all, this book is titled ""James Cameron's Titanic"" so readers really shouldn't expect more than a valentine to the director for his efforts on this film. You'll learn a thing or two but in the end you'll discover that it's a little empty and a bit of a disappointment."
5,excellent,this was an excellent movie +book excellent i reccommend it to every1 ####### 1 movie and if u dont like u need help
5,"Book was a masterpiece, just like the movie.","Excellent movie and excellent book. James Cameron is a genius. The man has incredible talent and it came through in this movie. Titanic is by far the best movie I have ever seen in my life. I have seen it four times already and can't wait to see it again. The book was just a great as the movie. No movie will ever top this one. This movie was an excellent tribute that Cameron gave to the memory of the poor people who perished in that tragic evening of April 14, 1912. Through this movie they were not only remembered but mourned. Another book that you must read is ""The Discovery of the Titanic"" by Dr. Robert D. Ballard, the one who found Titanic. It is an excellent book. Kudos for James Cameron!!!!"
5,The Everlasting Love,I feel that the story of Titanic featuring Jack and Rose is very romantic and touching. The love may die young but live in the heart for a lifetime.
4,"Good movie, Great book!!!!","The book, James Cameron's Titanic, was good. I recently saw the movie and the director's book only helped to enhance my appreciation for the movie. It is not a great movie, in my opinion, but it is a highly watchable and fascinating film. The mastery of the special effects used by Cameron to re-create the ""Titanic"" is evident in all of the scenes featuring the large cruiser. I recommend the movie to all, but I strongly encourage all readers to purchase the book ""Titanic"". Simply fabulous and worth a read!!!!"
5,"Awesome Book, Awesome Movie","I have already written in this once, but I fell that I must write again. Earlier, I was scrolling down the page, and I found a comment that I do not agree with. One movie goer and reader said that the only flaw in the movie was that Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) had to die. I do not agree with this comment mainly because if he lived, then it would seem like a fairy-tale ending. The Titanic was not a fairy tale and I think that the death of Jack Dawson portrayed that. Many people lost loved ones on that ship, many people like Rose (Kate Winslet)."
5,The best........ ever,"3 weeks ago a saw the movie and today I ordered the book. I can't wait to read it, because the film is the best I have ever seen. Since I read the other reviews I know that the book will not disappoint me and that the magic moments will stay in my mind forever.I hope some of you are willing to mail with me about this great movie. Feel free."
5,MUST SEE,"This book is so well done, and Ed Marsh has fulfilled a need so many people have to understand how some of the special effects were done. Great job!! I recommend this work to everyone."
5,Oh. Wow.,"This is the ultimate ""guide to the making of a film"" book I've seen. How much more amazing does it get?! If you liked the film, you'll absolutely love the book. If you didn't like the film, you'll still find it amazing how they did all the effects and everything. READ IT."
4,Titanic,"This book on how the film was made is FAR and AWAY better than the film itself.It is absolutely fascinating how the producers made this film, the models, the special effects, everything about this book is great.We do not own the DVD but we have seen the flick--this book about how the movie was made is better than the film."
5,Exquisitley written~Breathtaking pictures! A MUST HAVE!,"This book is the best book for anyone who is a Titanic movie fan, whether it be for the actors in it, or for the desire to know more about the making of this awesome movie. In reading over some of the reviews, it escapes me why someone who wasn't a fan of the film would even bother to purchase this book. I guess some people just like to complain! Do not fear being disappointed in this one...It is all you dreamed of and more! NonTitanic movie fans...Buy a book on a subject you ENJOY!!"
1,Titanic (The Book),"We ordered this book some time ago and to date January 19,2012 we have not received it. It is paid for but we haven't got it.This is very upseting and we aren't sure how to report this. I am hoping it will finally be mailed to us."
1,The Ship Sinks!,Why do you have to read this boring book after you saw that boring 3 hour movie just to remember that the ship sinks!! The Ship Sinks! How Boring!
1,Dissapointing,Boring! This book was a huge dissapointment. The storyline sucked too. The movie's way better.
3,Katriona,"Frankly, I haven't written the book, but instead, I'm looking for information. I don't have much access to bookshops, so I was wondering if anyone out there could tell me if there was any information on the actor Jason Barry [Tommy Ryan; AKA 'The-Irish-Guy-Who-Gets-Shot'] in this book, because he is my favorite actor. Thank you!"
1,Cameron's big ego trip,"Titanic was the worst movie of the year; there was no character development, a poor script, inadequate acting, a predictable finish, and now there's a book to glorify it? SHAME on the American public, who are so easily bought out by white hot stars and special effects!"
3,BOOK UNWORTHY OF THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"I consider Titanic,a heartwrenching, enoyable romance, to be the finest movie produced by man up until now. However, what made the movie so touching is its realism and how youf eel connected to the sinking, and the brief madien voyage. THis book has a disturbing objective view point, and it spends more time discussing how they got the bodies to look like they werehitting the propellers than on the tragedy and sweeping romantism of the tale itself."
5,"Kudos to Cameron's ""Titanic""","I just received this book for Easter and must comment on what a wonderful account it is of the blockbuster movie and what a tribute it is to the magical world of moviemaking. I will bide my time with it, while waiting for the release of the Titanic home video. This movie is truly a classic."
5,Fantasic Book!,"James Camerons Titanic would have to be the best film that I have ever seen. This book is a very good guide to the film and the production that went into it. I have the English edition which has no problems with the printing (eg Japanesse version) Worth getting for anyone interested in the movie or the Titanic itself. Beautiful companion piece to Titanic and illustrated history. Onto the movie itself. Best film I've ever seen I've seen this movie 6 times and plan to see it again before it finishes its run. Kate Winslet is the best and deserves to win the oscar for Best Actress. She was amazing. Leonardo Di Caprio was engaging as Jack and their romance was sooo intense. The last scene from the film was fantastic everytime I see the film I notice something different. Very touching scene. Great book and film I recommend it to everyone. Let's hope we see a ""directors cut"" sometime in the very near future."
5,My thoughts on Titanic,"I thought that Titanic was the best ever! and to believe that it's a true story! The book is great, just like the movie. I think that the movie is the best movie ever made. So you can kinda see what the book is like if you've seen the movie."
5,A wonderful movie companion!,"""James Cameron's Titanic"" has a little something for all different sets of movie fans. There's an incredible amount of photos and captures from the movie which will no doubt be scanned and posted on the net by hundreds of the movie's teenage fans (and those sites DO exist), while the way in which the making of the film is presented in words and behind-the-scenes photographs will surely please film students and buffs. The detail payed to the execution of the material is as meticulous and praise-worthy as the movie itself. This is a must-have for any fan of the movie, offering more than you could ask for for a movie that gives you everything you want from it."
3,James Cameron's Titanic,"I originally got this book for the pictures of the costumes, which were so beautiful! The book was an interesting look behind the workings of the making of the movie. Enjoyable, but not enough pictures of the costumes!"
5,Dazzling,"As a filmmaker, this book provided me with great insights on the making of one of the most seen films of all times. It's awesome for filmmakers as well as regular audience. It will blow you away. You will see the film under a different light."
5,Beautiful Photography!,This book has excellent photography of many scenes from the movie. It explains all the measures of making the movie from costumes to digital effects. It shows every character and their part in the film. The shots of the replica of the Titanic are very nice. It tells you how they built and designed the ship. It's like the Behind the Scenes of Titanic except it's in a book and you don't have to tape it. I enjoyed reading about how they made the computer extras. They look very real. I recommend this book to any Titanic fan or photographer.
3,YEAH BABY James Cameron your on top of the World!,"I am an Irish Lass myself and would go with the criticts and say it's a good movie, I have the book The Making of Titanic I have not read it all but I look at the Oh gosh good pictures. Just for Titaic fans out there I have seen it 4 times and plan to take my grandmother to see it soon."
5,Titanic Touches the Soul,"Along with the rest of the world, I have seen Titanic five times and I think it is the Best movie ever made. I think the storyline is one of the most touching. The book makes it all the better and reminds you of the fact that great movies have profound meanings in life. Don't forget this: Make it count!"
5,Women's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. Discover it!!!,"If Jack Dawson said to Rose Dewitt Bukatter, ""Winning the ticket is the best thing ever happened to me. It brought me to you!"" may be I should say, ""Watching this movie is the best thing ever happened to me. It opened my eyes to TITANIC disaster!"" I have seen the movie 4 times and planning to watch it again and again. I never get bored of this wonderful, beautiful, marvellous story of Titanic. I found myself a Titanic mania, I am hunting for any book and story on Titanic and love this book very much! Kate Winselt acted tremendously superb as Rose! She should win the Best Actress for this upcoming Academy Award! James Cameron's Titanic is unquestionably excellent story! There is no such ""perfect"" word to describe! Just watch and read the book, then you will know!"
5,James Cameron's Titanic was a unsinkable book.,"The book James Cameron's Titanic was breath-taking and astounding at the same time. You just wanted to do anyhting to stop this ship from sinking. Again, the photo's of the cast and crew were breath-taking, and for a person who,at age 9, has see the ship go down 4 times, it is as if it were still 1912 and the god was still, who other than the one and only, Mr. Leonardo DiCaprio."
4,Edward D Wood Jr.,this came in great condition except the box had a couple of dents in it but I dont want the box another thing were the back of the movies on the back of them they were colorized but the movie I was watching were in black and white which I prefer but I thought i would get a choice other than that they were great movies
1,Sickening,"There is no better example of our generation's morbid fascination with bad culture than a ""Box Set"" of the entire Ed Wood oeuvre. This is the ne plus ultra of kitsch, which, contra Susan Sontag, has no value whatsoever. It has only negative value. It subtracts from the beauty of the world. It is spiritually debilitating. Every moment spent in the presence of shoddy, inferior cultural products such as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" makes one less discerning, less intelligent and less fit for life. One wonders how many American kids' lives were blighted by sitting around in dark suburban living rooms on rainy afternoons consuming such filth. Go to YouTube and find one of Wood's movies. Try to sit through even five minutes of any of them without feeling nauseous. Bleh!"
1,Do not be fooled by these ratings,"Sure, there's a kick to be had out of making fun of Ed Wood and his films. But let's not go crazy and rate them as 5-star works of art. To rate these, even as a whole set, as anything but 1-star ""films"" is misleading.If you want to experience the pain of watching truly, TRULY awful movies by one of cinema's worst directors, pick this set up. If you're looking for good films to watch, this is not what you're looking for."
5,A stand-out in the world of smart folk-pop,"I've always been a sucker for the old Joni Mitchell school of acute observation, unflinching honesty, and careful writing in songs, and Patti Witten, in Land of Souvenirs, has put out an album full, beginning-to-end, of all three. Her singing is nicely understated and unaffected, her guitar work nothing short of masterful, and her melodies are unfailingly memorable, interesting, and catchy, even when they're gracing a less-than-cheery lyric. She has an unmistakable musical sensibility that takes pleasing roads less travelled enough to make her a stand-out in the world of smart folk-pop. All this, and she can rock, too! Producer and multi stringed-instrumentalist Rich DePaulo's contribution is in the ""it just doesn't come any better"" class, and a nice collection of other fine Ithaca-area musicians rounds out the effort to make it one of the best from Upstate New York in recent memory. (Reviewer: Tom Sieling)"
5,Reaches to the core,"A wonderful way to impart the cultivation of Zen to those who have never gone thru the experience. I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed ""The Whole Heart of Tao""."
5,His Girl Friday,"Back cover reads:""Once my mouth covers yours, there's no going back.""Even as his lips dragged roughly across hers, Danetta Marist knew her boss meant what he said. He was always arrogant and demanding, and this kiss was no exception. She could barely breathe for the intense heat that sizzled between them. But she believed in marriage, and Cabe Ritter was a terrible womanizer...In fact, Cabe used his 'ladies' man' image; it kept him safe from women-like his pretty secretary-who wanted a commitment. But Danetta's innocence went to his head and, once he'd held her in his arms, he wanted to keep her there-forever!"

3,Disappointing,"It took me many many weeks to get through the book. I rarely will not finish a book once I begin as I feel there's usually some good in it. I'm not finding it here! The characters are at times (few) interesting, but rather shallow. There isn't much to the plot either. I'll not be looking for more from this author, sorry to say."
4,"Smooth, easy read",Nice romantic novel without much sex. More emphasis on the romance. Beautiful description of the Tennessee location. Pace is very good.
3,a bit pretentious and precious for my taste,I was disappointed by both the over blown style of writing and the plo
5,Vivid Imagery and Characters,Fall in love with Venus and Gib. The story jumps right off the page and into your heart. This is a fun read!
3,Not as good as her previous books,"I enjoyed her previous books and had been waiting for months for this one. I was disappointed. It's an easy read, but with none of the richness and complexity I had come to expect."
1,"Why, Oh Why did I waste time on this book?","I read A Place to Call Home and loved it! Needless to say I was excited to start reading this book. Well I kept reading and reading.....saying to myself ""It will get better""! I read all the way to page 133 and said enough is enough! The story goes nowhere! The author just spits out new characters and you have to re-read the paragraphs 3 times to figure out ""where did this guy come from?"" and you just give up and keep going. This is the first book that I have not finished reading. And that is saying a lot since I'm a librarian and have read some pretty dull stuff...."
5,best book of the year,"a work of genius and a pleasure to read. this book is essential for any museumgoer and the general reader with any interest in either artist. revealing the mutual respect and support between two very different men, with outstanding illustrations and insightful prose. i cannot remember any art history book so erudite and approachable."
2,Too tedious,"What a great premise! What a great subject matter! Perhaps this was originally an academic thesis....because it reads like it....tedious, uninspired and slow. No disrespect to the author intended, but it missed the mark for me."
3,A Little Disappointed,"Although the book did get to me on time, I was a little disappointed with its condition. There were a couple of stains (albeit, small ones) on the front cover, and the bottom and sides of the book were really dirty, as if the book was atop a really dusty shelf for a while. A bought it as a gift for someone, so I didn't like the fact that it was that dirty. They sent it back and got a different, and it was almost in the same condition. With nice art books, it would be helpful if they were actually shrink-wrapped to protect it from the elements. Oh well."
1,Not helpful for most of us,"This pretty book is a little bit dishonest, I found. It's OK if you are just starting out in life and have the luxury of buying things that naturally go together. In that case, the premise that you can cut clutter by displaying your possessions (because they're all the same color) works. Unfortunately, most of us own and love a variety of objects, such as gifts and family heirlooms, and those things don't always go together naturally. So, Ithink the authors cheated a bit, making it easy on themselves by showing us how to group those things that do, of course, go together. The book seems to be more a statement of a certain style (white, white, white) instead of delivering what it promises in terms of storage help."
1,A Place for Everything,"Taking tips from Julie Morgenstein I recently completely decluttered my life. I am left with only the things I love and use and am ready to make storage purchases. I was hoping for a book with pictures of before and afters, of cleaning supplies, cosmetics, etc. stored several different ways (wicker, plastic, boxes, on the door, under the sink, etc.), and tips on where to buy the storage supplies. 'A Place for Everything,' unfortunately, seems to be just a photo journey through one victorian home which I thought looked quite cluttered! The moral seemed to be if it is antiquey looking, by all means leave it out, because that is art, not clutter. I agree with the other reviewer who said ""save your money"" and use it to buy organizational supplies!"
4,Great pictures!,"The pictures in this book were well-done and thought provoking. Although many people may not have an antique eyewear collection, the pictures give ideas for creative storage/display of collectibles. It stresses how you can utilize unused space by displaying items out in the open. There are some good ideas presented."
2,"Pretty, but impractical","The authors own several houses and a great many things - all of which they have organized. The huge closet that is also a laundry room is wonderful; storing items on closet floors means dust and fuzz in whatever is stored there. Rather than organizing all this stuff, why didn't they get rid of some of it?"
1,wrong part ..not close to factory wiring,straight up it does not work for 1993 dodge stealth coupe....worthless...plugged into harness following directions and my lights turn on!!!!! after some research it does not match at all...had to order harness from crutchfield
5,The Only One that Really Works,"I've been relying on this lotions for over a decade. Of the many I've tried, it's the only one that provides both immediate dryness relief and long-lasting moisturizing. Some may find the initial glycerin slickness to be excessive, especially on hands, but if you have skin as dry as mine you'll tolerate a minute or two of ""greasiness"" for the softness and comfort that lasts for hours. These comments are for Neutrogena Emulsion only -- Neutrogena Body Lotion did not work well for me."
5,A great lotion,"My husband loves this lotion and will not use anything else. It is light and absorbes quickly, but has great staying power. It will eliminate dry skin. He also loves that it is fragrance free."
3,Okay-Okay,I found this book okay-okay. The pictures were great and the descriptions were good but the choice is not so good. I expected a little bit more from this book. Like 20 more toys wouldn't hurt.
5,Reo's 70s material,This is the first Reo cd I bought and i loved it. If your new to Reo or want to hear some of there best 70's material this is the cd for you.
4,14 year old fan,"i'm 14 years old and my dad bought this cd for him cuz he had this album on vynal (vinal? vynil?) and i gotta say...i've only heard the first four songs and i really like them. I'm normally a pure rock or punk rock fan of the newer generation (smashing pumpkins, green day,) but i also enjoy MANY classic rock bands (such as the beatles and alot of the more recent classic rock) and so far this is a really good cd! the only reason i rated this 4 stars is cuz i havnt heard the rest of the album."
5,Early REO Fan,"I used to hear REO at Teen Center dances, and they weren't just learning their licks either. They had it down. Songs like ""Like You Do"" and ""Golden Country!"" I didn't consider them regional songs. Listen to them! Give this collection a listen."
4,Works very well on some fabrics,I've used Wine Away on a variety of fabrics as we seem to constantly spill red wine on things. I have found that it works very well on my oriental and long sheep hair rugs which is awesome as they would both have been ruined otherwise. It also works fairly well on thin cotton clothing and not as well on flannel and jeans (even after multiple applications and washing). So I can't give it 5 stars as it doesn't work on everything but it is pretty amazing and works well on most things.
5,Stain remover,"I bought this to use on pills of red wine. However, I haven't had the problem of removing red wine stains. However, I did use it for another stain and it did a very good job of removing the stain."
3,So-So Results With This Product,"The manufacturer states that this product even works on old stains. I was a bit disappointed in it's performance. It removed some of the 4-day-old red wine stain, but not all. The stain only faded somewhat. Not really enough to be able to wear the dress again. I expected better results, based on the reviews of others here and the fact that this was a cotton dress, which is not a complicated fabric to treat. Maybe it works better on new spills. That remains to be seen. Or maybe I'd be better off permanently switching to white wine."
1,Did not work,I'm surprised so many people had such success with this product as referenced in the reviews. The stains were not removed on my tablecloth at all after using it twice. I ended up needing to take my wine-stained tablecloth to the cleaners. I completely wasted my money on this purchase.
2,Didn't work at all for me.,"I had a stain consisting of crystal lite, unfortunately, red, which I thought this product should work well on, since it works on red wine, but it didn't even lighten the stain. I was not impressed at all."
5,Wine Away Is The Best,"Been using this product for several years. Used to buy locally for $10 per bottle, is about 25% cheaper thru Amazon. Works on carpet, upholstery & clothing. Have not found a red wine stain that it will not remove. Excellent product."
3,"Good on carpet, Nothing Else!","We had a ""wine accident"" which resulted in purplish red spots all over the floor and bed. I bought Wine Away with high hopes of a ""magical removal of stains."" Although stains, old and new, magically erased off the carpet, the bed linens were a different matter. Wine away made the stains blue, and after a wash (as directed on the label) the now blue stains remained - although faint. Don't buy Wine Away if your expecting a miracle, rather, save the money for the product and shipping for new sheets, pillow cases, and duvet covers!"
5,This stuff is AMAZING!,I've used this product for years. It works great on clothing. I've even used it on larger spills on the carpet and been pleasantly surprised at the results.
5,Amazing,My husband and I now take a small bottle of Wine Away with us when we travel - - it's THAT good!
5,Totally works!,"Worked on a 6 day old red wine stain on the carpet!!! I actually didn't even scrub it all that much, just left it on for a few minutes and then used a cloth to remove the excess. Almost all of it was gone.It really works!!!"
4,One of the best groups,"I have purchased four recordings by this group and each one is a blessing. The music has a country sound and speaks straight form the heart. I suppose they could be compared to the Talleys or Nelons. I must say though, that I truly enjoy this group better. I have kept an eye out for new releases and will buy them also when available."
4,So Far So Good,"I rate this item a 4/5 as opposed to a 5/5 only because I purchased it to treat my 4-year-old daughter's eczema and I have only been using it for a short time (approximately 3 weeks). Consequently I have not had a chance to determine the full extent of it's effectiveness. So far, howevever, it seems to be doing a very good job with relieving the symptoms of itching and irritation that she often experiences as a result of her condition. I would recommend the use of Shea Butter for the treatment of eczema. My daughter complains notably less often of itching with the use of Shea Butter than she has with any of the many other products that I have tried."
4,"Good Grip, Installs.... ok","This is a nice clutch pad, which I guess can also be good for an emergency brake pedal.Installing was a different story, I recommend some water and a nice pair of non-slip gloves to do the job. You basically have to slide the metal bare pedal under the shallow lip on the back of the replacement pedal and work it around the sides and bottom. I found that it was easier to start from the bottom and work to the top. It has to be tight and once it's on, it's on very well. Pretty universal and OEM looking, fit on my Ford Ranger."
4,Love and sci-fi all in one.,"Pyr has traveled world and has few illusions left. When a chance encounter with an insane priestess leaves him full of a slow-acting poison for which there is no cure, Pyr, spaceship captain, pirate, and warrior, steps up his efforts to rid space of a teeming, ravenous plague. Rox Merkrator is a koltarc, a legendary race of telepathic healers. She is trying her best to lead a normal life, have a normal relationship. The plague is spreading though, and even if Roxy cannot heal but one poor soul at a time, she still must try. In a nightmare existence, where death is the ultimate enemy these two beings find each other and unleash the power of their unique bond to save a universe. A satisfying science fiction presented by Speculation Press withb excellent taste."
5,great story,This is a wonderful futurisic romance story. This book is filled with lots on action with character's you can't help but love. This is definately a pager turner that you find hard to put down until you get to the end.
4,Space pirates saving the world - what more could you want?!,"Took me a while to get into it but once I was engaged, I was properly hooked. In a complicated universe Roxanne Shirah is a Koltiri, a 6 foot goddess who can heal anyone. At the same time, the story of Pyr unfolds, as he searches for one of his shipmates. And then there is the outbreak of the sagouran plague and it's equally vile 'cure' Rust, an addictive drug. Finally all the threads meet and Pyr and Roxy join forces to combat the plague and save the universe. It's not as good as the Liaden books, but it had strong world building and I liked the h/h dynamics. Some of the other characters were underwritten but it was a fun ride and by the end I was gripped. Surprisingly enjoyable, and I want to know what happens next..."
1,Profoundly awful - bad bad bad,"Based on reviews above I bought this book and tried to get into it. But it was so dumbfounding bad - in writing, plot, tone and sheer yuckiness - that I had to stop about 1/3 of the way through. And although normally I donate all my discards to my local library book sale, in this case I just threw it out because I couldn't donate something so dreadful."
3,"Tapping, Tapping at my chamber door","I am a fan of Amanda Tapping and Christopher Heyerdahl from the better ""Stargates,"" but even they cannot elevate this series beyond the pedestrian. Although some episodes are nicely done, others seem to be rejected scripts snatched from the trash bin. I purchased Season Three in blu-ray because I knew it would be at least watchable and I needed something to watch. Special effects do not support a weak script, but they create more fun than watching Oprah. It is possible that the entire series (which finds regular roles for Jack the Ripper, Jeykell and Hyde, and Nickola Tesla) is tongue-in-check, but if so, why aren't I laughing more? Like many SyFy offerings, this is good enough to watch-once."
5,Superb,"For fans of Sanctuary, the adventure continues. I only wish that they could work Ashly back into the story line, but this is one of my favorite Sct Fi series ever."
5,Fantastic,"All I can say is this is a fantastic series. I don't have time to just catch regular series on tv on a regular basis. So I just buy the intire series season by season. This show gets a solid 5 stars, and it looks like we will be blessed with another season. Get it and add it to your collection."
5,Dump Abby PLEASE!,"I'm now watching Season 3 and am delighted at having 20 episodes. I love this show. For me Helen Magnus can do no wrong. Druitt and Tesler are big favorites as well. Never a dull moment with them.My one complaint is that Will's new love interest, Abby, is insufferable, by turns pseuo-cute, coy and a hazard to Will's life at every turn. I pray that she will not become a staple of the show. I have barely adjusted to the formerly obnoxious Kate, who has softened considerably. Abby is the quintessential ""Bimbo"" parading as a behavioral analyst. However her character is unstable, veering from ditzy to seductive, to victim to fool to ""clever-cute"" (supposedly witty?)Anyway this has colored one particular episode, where she and Will are kidnapped - very badly. Against the other characters all of whom have dignity and presence, this one stands out like a sore thumb. I'm surprised that none of the other reviewers have mentioned her. I'm really hoping she disappears - and soon."
5,Great season!!,The show is really expanding beyond the walls inside the Sanctuary! Some of it is REALLY way out there but it is science fiction so isn't all of it?? Cannot wait for Season 4!!
4,Now into Full season of this great and immaginative show.,The show still the same yet it's become much more far fetched. And the episodes are so radically different some shows.Yet still it's one of the most creative sci fi shows on. Remember this is a very English show. I love to give 5 stars but I just can not go there with this season. Yet reccomended.
3,Gone too soon,It was a great idea and a great show that some how lost it's way (maybe the sci-fi cahannel) but got it together in the end
2,Sanctuary Third Season Standard DVd,"I actually mistakenly ordered the standard DVD instead of the Blu Ray and how I wish I hadn't done that. While the stories remain good the video quality was, at times, worse than VHS. I was stunned at the really bad picture that the first two episodes had (and this was on a BD player with HDMI). Fuzzy, out of focus, digital artifacts, and lacking in detail. Also, I guess it was the day after the party at the packing plant as every disc was scratched. I don't know if BD is better, and maybe I got a bad set, but I can't recommend the standard DVD."
2,not satisfied,because outta 6 dvd's the first 2 didn't play and i had to watch the 8 episodes on cast t.v. for $1.99 an episode outta my own pocket that im not getting back.
1,ZZZZZZZanctuary,"Starts out with an excellent premise, a home "" sanctuary"" for the misundertood creatures & beasties of ancient lore. Within 3 episodes they are shooting conventional handguns in the usual abandoned factory sets, having car chases & resorting to old clichéd plotlines & hoary tropes. Predictable baddies and too often, once the freaks are intro-ed, they are written as tedious soap characters. The only upside of this kind of show is for the actors in Vancouver, who get employed."
2,The Remastering was been awful,"This is the Remastering of the original ""Classical Barbra"" from 1975, plus two unreleased outtakes. However the remastering work has been really awful, and the original recordings sound better than this compilation. Since Amazon didn't sell the new songs individually, I purchased the CD, but I made a new one with the 1975 originals and this two new songs. A missed opportunity from Sony, again, since the recordings were from the time when Barbra's voice was at her peak."
4,Smaller than expected,Good basic dictionary and easy to carry (and not be seen consulting it!). Good find at Amazon.
2,NOT FULL SEASON!!!!,NOT FULL SEASON!!! Wish I would have known beore I bought! No wonder it was only $5.99. Hope they add more episodes of the show.
4,Good stuff,"Loved watching these DVD's. I think it was a pretty good season, but not the best (def. not the worst)."
5,Excellent Field Guide for Trained Personnel,"Pendley's Guide is divided into separate sections on Rope Rescue, Confined Space Rescue, Swiftwater Rescue, Trench Rescue, Structural Collapse Rescue, and Helicopter Operations.Each section is illustrated with line drawings that are amply annotated and easy to understand. This Guide is a reference I plan to use for training and on-scene incident size-up and execution of complex rescue operations. It measures 4""x7""x0.5"", so it will fit in most of the pockets of my rescue jumpsuit. I've tested the paper; it's water-resistant but not water-proof. The pages are pretty sturdy, though, and should take a moderate beating in the field without ripping out of the spiral binding.This is just what we need when we are confronted with a challenge that has a high risk factor and requires a by-the-book approach. Of course, it will be next to useless unless we practice using it, as a team, in varying evolutions on the practice field."
4,Gripping Story,"This book has been re-released as ""Three Against Hitler."" Same story, different cover and title. It is inspiring and frightening. Read in conjunction with ""The Boy Who Dared"" by Susan Campbell Bartoletti about Wobbe's friend, Helmuth Hubener, who masterminded the ""resistance"" and was executed for it."
3,So far so good,"Taking this at the recommendation of my dermatologist for thinning skin, brittle nails, etc. Haven't seen any changes yet, but also have no complaints. Will update in another month."
4,great value for price,"I've just started taking this particular brand, but if it works like the other I'll be very happy cause it will last me more than 2 months."
3,Not up to par.,"I am teaching a class on San Francisco at SF State University in the Spring and really was interested in using this book as my course textbook. I'm really impressed with the content, but, unfortunately, I cannot use it as a text book because 1.) despite extensive factual claims and quotes, the author fails to give citations (there are absolutely no footnotes or endnotes), and 2.) there are a number of grammatical errors, in particular inconsistent punctuation. I can hardly expect my students to write essays using standard citation and correct punctuation if their textbook fails to provide it. Too bad. I would have ordered 65 copies of the book. However, I recommend the book to casual readers, interested in San Francisco history."
4,Tote bag,i like this tote. kinda big and roomy. but i didn't like the openiness of it so i put a zipper in it so to close it. and it's complete now. the colors are very calm.
2,Amateurish recording,"I don't remember if I listened to the Balakirev, butthe Taktakishivili seems to have been recorded fromacross the street from the concert hall. At timesthe piano fades out almost entirely.This is a major disappointment since my LP(Colosseum) is getting old and I wanted a CD ofthis work, but I'll have to keeping looking."
3,Tarzan and Jane in the jungle.....,"My second Linda Howard book. Not as good as Son of the Morning, but not bad. Jane is a strong feminine character who has some human qualities that keep her from being too perfect a heroine. Grant seems the typical hero though... My problem with the book is how neatly everything tied up at the end. In less than a page Grant is reunited with family who hasn't heard him laugh in 20 years. It was still an enjoyable read, the sex was steamy and the sparks flew. Isn't that what romance is all about?"
4,Excellent book,"Story Summary: Grant Sullivan is hired to find Jane Greer, who has been kidnapped. Once he rescues her from the bad guys they travel through the jungle where they become lovers. She falls in love with him while he tries to fight the same feelings. There is some suspenseful moments since this is somewhat a spy verses spy book. Now to why I liked the book.First, Grant was great. He was rough and demanding but hey, he had to be to keep them alive.Second, Jane was great. She was strong but always kept a sense of humor. I loved her bag of tricks that she kept. Typical woman.I didn't like the end that much. It was rather hokey but it didn't take away from the story.Also this is where you first meet Kell Sabin, who will have his own story in Diamond Bay. I recommend you buy this book first, then Diamond Bay, then Heartbreaker (because that is the sequal to Diamond Bay) and then White Lies (which also features Kell Sabin). A very good read if you can find this book."
4,Classic Roosevelt-- for good and bad,"This little collection of Roosevelt's speeches and essays gives a wonderful taste for the jingo President's beliefs in a Strenuous Life of hard work, manly virtues and manifest destiny. As a historian, I'm fascinated that this is being marketed as speaking to today's Americans. Roosevelt's comments on the role of white middle-class Protestant women as the breeders of a virile race and his exhortations to embrace 'righteous war' might seem a bit strange as current-day advice, stemming as they do from Teddy's concerns with forcing the Spanish out of Cuba and with 'race suicide,' the belief that white Protestants were being out-bred by Catholic immigrants and African-Americans. For those interested in the Establishment position on those issues in 1900, however, or in Roosevelt himself-- some of these were speeches and the rhythm of them gives you a wonderful idea of what they must have sounded like being delivered-- this is a valuable resource."
1,Remarkable Content; Inferior Publication,"I was very excited to receive this and start reading it. My excitement turned into disappointment when I saw the content start repeating. At first I thought ""certainly TR didn't repeat himself so redundantly"". Then, I realized that it was the publication itself. In my copy, the speech just starts over on page 16, 26 (starts on 2nd paragraph this time), and it goes on and on it seems. There is no indication that you are rereading what has already been printed. It just goes from one paragraph to the next and the next paragraph may be a repeat of what was on page 1.I guess I will go through the hassle of packaging this up and sending it back to Amazon."
5,Shipped quickly.,This was a gift for my son and he was very pleased with this book . I would recommend this book.
5,Good book,"Clear graphics and very very detailed. No history lessons, author's vision or other personality intrussions as found in other building books. Looks like the technical manual of the platform framing method to me."
2,Decent book. - Poorly organized,"I have a ton of home improvement type books, since I am a pro handyman - largely self taught. This book is hard to get through. It is cumbersome and poorly organized. Not recommended."
5,House Framing,Lots og information in an easy to read layout. Well written and easy to flow. I plan on using the inforation to build my own cabin in northern Wisonsin.
2,Half Off a TRUCK?! (not a pair of TRUCKS),"This is a ""Truck"" I was looking for and it looks like it will work once I get two and make it a proper set or pair. It's a sturdy 85mm Banana board truck thats hard to find.Buyer beware; if you are looking for a set of ""Trucks"" as they normally come in pairs you must order two. The savings is because its only half a product, not a set of as described Trucks. A waste of time and shipping you might want look for a vendor that actually supplies skate products not products."
4,A decent handbook,A decent handbook for beginning residents especially emergency medicine residents. Decent guide on signs and symptoms; making the diagnosis; treatment and disposition. A little too brief in places and occasional errors but well worth it.
4,Great starter book,"Great, easy-to-read, overview of emergency diagnosis and treatment. A bit superficial compared to the other Current titles and definitely not a definitive text on the subject. However, this edition is an excellent starting point for someone learning the basics and the older editions are a great value at only a few dollars each."
2,current medical diagnosis & treatment,this book is too brisk.you don't have to own this book to know when to dispatch the patient.you have to evaluate more on the treatment like what to do before admiting the patient into the hospital.
1,Not worth it..,"Recieved this a month ago(have used it 5 times for simple milkshakes)plastic piece that holds mixing wand, has cracked in half. Now, it's going in the garbage."
2,Does'nt hold up with age,"Unlike other JP cd's which hold up with age, and some get better with age, like Turbo, this cd seems to sound more immature each time I listen to it.There are too many pseudo-tough,, pseudo-biker, pseudo-rebellion, pseudo-anti-establishment songs that would appeal to a teenager, but gradually lose their appeal later.Songs like Grinder, Breaking the law, You don't have to be old to be wise, and United emphasize this point.JP cd's in that era like Hell bent for leather, Screeming for vengence and Defenders of the faith, have less such anthemic songwriting, thus hold up with age.As one who thoroughly loved this cd as a teenager, it would be a great cd to get such a person into heavy metal"
3,"not the best, alot is better","i have just got into metal thanx to a friend, so i have been lookin up bands and i came along this one, when i first heard it, i thought it was awesome, BUT i started listening to other metal and relized..these guys aren't THAT good. The better metal is iron maiden, metallica, ac/dc, slayer, anthrax, panthera i could go on! it is worth the money don't get me wrong, but just look at some other ones to, because there are many better bands out there"
3,It's raining men,"When I realized that Halford was singing all of his songs to men, it disturbed me. Ugghh... Rob Halford is breaking the law in more ways than one."
3,Mixed Bag,"Okay, I'm sure many will disagree with this, but to me this was the roots of Priest's downfall as a seriously creative force in heavy metal and the beginning of a commercial upswing that involved compromise in their music. I think they wanted to simplify to win over the AC/DC crowd (and I DO like AC/DC also). What we get is a lot of easy shout alongs like 'Grinder',the overplayed and irritating 'Livin' After Midnight'and the Beavis And Butthead enshrined 'Breakin' The Law' ('Washin' The Dog'). Moments of greatness do surface;'Rapid Fire' is a great track that pre-dates speed metal,and 'The Rage'(also the name of a now defunct Baltimore live music club -RIP) is an epic that would have been at home on one of the better earlier releases. 'Steeler' is a great track that closes the album. This was the last Priest album that I actually bought."
5,Great one!,"After Stained class and Hell Bent for leather... It came this beautiful Masterpiece from the most powerful Metal band ever... This is the following of a group of great albums... Although it is the most comercial album, it doesn't mean is so bad. ""Breaking the law"" and ""living after midnight"" are songs than anyone of the Metal-fans would recognize... ""Rapid fire"" is a speed song that grabs the attention of anyone... Grinder is the almighty song, I think the most underrated song here is ""The Rage"" Good enough to be one of the best ""United"" and ""Steeler "" are songs that makes this album complete. ""DOn't have to be old to be wise"" is the only weird song here both I like it anyway.So... If you're looking to be a Judas Priest fan... Let this be your first... You'll know what everyone know... and let Defenders of the faith be the second... You'll find yourself being caught by Judas all mighty strenght... METAL GODS IS THE BEST SON OF THE ALBUM!"
5,It started here!,"One of Judas Priest's most memorable album. ""Breakin The Law"", ""Grinder"", ""Livin After Midnight"", and other rockin' tunes can be found. This album made me want to learn to play the guitar! From the minute I heard it, I knew that's what I wanted to do. I'm sure many others feel the same way. A MUST for any rockin' CD collection!"
3,Non rusting grommets.,"These grommets are for light weight sunshade like you can get at Walmart...not the heavy duty grade sunshade...I used them on both. It is very hard to get them on the heavy duty sunshade and they come apart easy. I also used them on the lighter weight sunshade material and they worked great, it is nice that they don't come apart and they don't rust when used on the light weight material."
1,Broken Glass,"Well, I'm not sure how I would rate the item because it arrived in pieces. The box had one flimsy piece of brown paper, otherwise no packing material--to ship a glass covered cake dish--was supposed to be two pieces, arrived in about two hundred. It's hard to fathom why someone would think packing a fragile piece this way would ever make it intact. Not sure I will order anything fragile through Amazon again..."
2,Not a great cake plate,"This cake plate and dome cover look very nice, and the combo arrived intact with good packaging. However, there were two problems for me. One is that there are a few small bubbles in the glass, so it is not super high quality glassware. Two, and most important, is that the cake plate has a raised center where the cake plate meets the top of the stand; this makes the cake plate not level so that the sides of a cake may droop -- not high quality for a cake container. I've returned the product. For the price, looks were not enough to overcome the two problems."
2,Not Worth the Price,"I registered for this cake dome as a wedding gift, and just received it. Buyer beware: it may say ""designed"" in Italy - but this cake dome is made in China. Had I known this, I would NOT have registered for/bought it. The description is incredibly misleading.In addition to this, and as is the case with most things mass-produced in China, the quality is no superb, certainly NOT worth the $50 price tag. It has several little flaws, some bubbles in the glass (I suppose the only indication it was ""hand blown""?) but the worst aspect is that the rims are not finished. The rim on the bottom of the dome and the top of the stand are unfinished and therefore SHARP. For $50 I would imagine it should be smooth all around.It's still very pretty, but for me the bottom line is: if you're going to get something made in China and of inferior quality, save thirty bucks, and go for the $20 dome."
2,Arrived Broken,"The Cake plate definitely seems like it would be a great gift, although I don't know if that is true b/c it arrived in a hundred pieces. The UPS guy luckily let me open in front of him because he heard the broken glass when he picked it up. It's crazy that this just ships in the box without any sort of protective packaging. I reordered another one hoping for the best, but honestly don't see how it could arrive intact with the way they package it. Not sure if this is the manufacturer's fault or amazon's fault, but at the end of the day it's poorly packaged and not worth the risk if you need it in time for something. I'd suggest purchasing another one, or probably just finding one at your local shop."
5,A lot of power for a little price,"This was just as it was pictured. The first time I used it I was amazed at how much power it had for such a small compact unit. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in buying it.I have owned gas powered leaf blowers, electric leaf blowers and have always had a hard time with their bulkiness and weight. This lightweight leaf blower is impressive."
4,Great (big) bag,"This is a really nice bag - I haven't had it long, but it seems tough as nails. Lots of pockets. I wish there were a way to divide the main compartment across its short dimension, rather than just across its long one. Also, note that the dimensions given above are the inside dimensions of the main pocket - the bag itself is quite a bit bigger than that."
2,not what I expected.,"This bag has a lot of compartments which is great. I wanted something to hold all my gear for work. Didn't like this bag at all. Actually sold it to a guy at work for 20.00 who liked it. Go buy a decent bag at your local store. Even a gym bag is better than this bag in my opinion. Was too stiff and narrow. Zippers were hard to utilize. Had to basically hold the bag down while zipping or unzipping.If you want something you wont need to get in and out of on a constant basis throughout the day then it is a great bag. If, like me, you needed a bag that was accessible whenever you needed it then I would look at getting a 5.11 tactical backpack."
5,love it,"love it!after lookin at several bags i ordered one range bag but it was too small. i tried this one and it is perfect for a patrol ""tricky bag"". it fits my binos, nvgs, and about a dozen other small items in the main compartment. durable, roomy, strudy zippers, and nice straps."
4,range bag,"I've taken this bag with me to the range multiple times already and it does it's job perfectly. It is way bigger than i thought it was. I read other reviews and saw that people said the same thing, but i figured what the hell anyways. It seems very durable and have yet to have any problems with it. One thing that i noticed other people reviewed about it, is that it is quite heavy right out of the box, even with nothing in it. So it does seem pretty heavy when it's fully loaded with range gear. But it has plenty of room and plenty of pockets for ammo, multiple pistols, mags, and whatever else you wanna take with you."
3,Wasn't A Waste At Least,I never could get into this series very much. I always tried but after so many plot points that got picked up and then dropped again it just became a chore to keep up with whatever story elements it tried to present. What started as a very interesting premise dissolved very quickly into lots of half ideas that eventually fizzled out. The time I spent on this series wasn't a waste but I certainly don't feel compelled to see the next OVA or TV season in the series.
5,xxxHolic Sixth Collection,Bought all DVDs individually and loved the whole series. It's so funny to see ther main character being haunted by ghosts that he can only see and having the love of his life talking to his arch enemy who could care less about her. Very wonderful series. Can't wait for season 2 to come out.
2,You Get What you Pay For,Guess this is just another instance of you get what you pay for. The foam on these rollers is not very dense and does not do a good job of forming curls. I would advise against buy these curlers.
1,meh,"These are in no way ""large"". I guess it is my fault for thinking an inch is an inch. They are NOT an inch in diameter. Other than that they are fine, but they would make teeny tiny curls - not what I was after."
5,Willie and Ray outsing them all,you might not think the combination of Price and Nelson would be so good but how well they blend Willie has a one of the kind voice and RAY IS THE BEST OF ALL TIME Together they are quite a team
5,Great album!,"This album is truly great! Willie & Carl do Bob Wills songs, perhaps even better than Bob Wills did them!!!"
2,Backyardigan Drum you really have to beat,"For my twin toddler children, this chair is definitely not a fun toy. While they love Backyardigans and the characters in it, this chair is the hardest thing to get working. An adult literally needs to beat on the arm rests to get the unit to start playing music. It obviously is not very comfortable either as my twin girls prefer to try to beat the chair arms with a hard plastic toy while sitting on a stuffed animal and rarely sit in it even during the Backyardigans show. Unless you have a boy who may like to hit things very hard and loves this show, I don't recommend this chair."
4,My three year old loves this chair.,"My three year old loves this chair. The chair is motion activated and plays a drum tune, with buttons on the arm rests to add variations to the tune with symbols, bongo sounds, etc. Another reviewer said you have to beat on the buttons to get the chair to play, but that reviewer must not have realized that the chair is motion activated. All you have to do is give it a little shake to start the drum beat. No amount of pounding on the buttons will get the chair to play, unless your pounding shakes the chair, in which case the motion will activate the chair. Some people would rather get mad than try to give a situation a little thought, I guess. We think this is a great toy and would recommend it to anyone."
5,My 2 cents,"There's nothing to be said that everyone else hasn't. This album is simply brilliant. The other reviewer is right. There's a reason this keeps getting 5 stars. And this isn't 5 stars for the new destiny's child album. This is a serious, 5 stars, benchmark album. A classic in every sense. The way all the styles are different, yet blend together seemlessly , is outstanding. For some reason, I got this album in the winter, and it reminds me of snow and winter, so its difficult to listen to it in the summer. By that's my little quirk. You go out and find it if you can. I found one at my local used place for $6.99, previously I had it on cassette, I nearly fainted. $6.99 for this ? And I paid $15 for Oasis?"
1,Very Disappointed!!!!,"Nowhere on this ad does it say you have to assemble the whole car and on top of this paint it! Imagine how embarrassed I was when my father opened his gift and found dozens of bags with small, plastic parts! GRRRR!!!"
4,Love this album..,"When I was a junior higher, my favorite type of music was rap. I listened to mostly Christian rap like SFC, Dynamic Twins, PID, etc. One day, I was looking for new music to buy, and I spotted this album. I loved the cover, and took a chance and bought it. Long story short, I never bought another rap album again. This album opened my eyes to good, modern rock and roll. I had the cassette, and played it until it broke. I bought the CD to replace it, and just about wore it out as well. This album is awesome, and still sounds great today. The instrumentation is great. The vocals and melodies are catchy and singable. I also bought ""Balance of Power"" and this album is good as well. This album is almost 20 years old now, but sounds better than most of the ""edgy"" christian music that I hear today. If your a fan of Pearl Jam, The Throes or the 77's, than you should check this out!"
3,Tea Party,"Love it or hate it, it's fascinating stuff. And now that the Tea Party has adopted his methods here in the US, it's as relevant as ever."
5,Handbook for Marxist,I found it interesting being able to track the advance of Marxism in our current administration. Parallels are scarry. Not so far from the 60's and 70's.
4,everything you ever wanted to know ...,"This is a must-read for all conservatives. It is very eye-opening about how causes are pursued by certain hard-core liberals who border on anarchists. Very contemporary reading, given the political climate and the fact that the current President was a student of this material while becoming a neighborhood organizer in Chicago.The wonderful irony of this book is in the final chapter. The author points out that revolution will only happen when the middle class becomes sufficiently stirred to rise up against the government. Problem is ... they expected the middle class to rise up against a conservative government, not a liberal one!This is a short book and well written, but takes a while to read due to the stunning revelations that are there in black and white."
2,Rules for Radicals,"I bought this book to see what was in the background of Barack Obama. He took this course from Sol Alinsky in Chicago. It is an interesting to know that Barack Obama and the community Organizers share the same viewpoint as Sol Alinsyk. Rules for radicals seems to ascribe motivations to people who were recognized Leaders in history which is clearly wrong. However, it satisfies his thesis. So if you want to know how to overturn the ""Have's"" in our country and give the ""Have Not's"" ruler ship, this book provides the method. What I find troubling is that when the ""Have Not's"" get power they set up the same kind of oppressive rules that the ""Have's originally had. It seems like a circular system with no improved outcome. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,Horror story,"I rated this book 5 stars for one reason, and one reason only-- NOT because I like the book, but because it is very informative.This may well be the scariest thing I have ever read in my life!!It was very enlightening to read this book and realizing that several of our current leaders in the U.S. not only read and studied this book in college, etc.....but, that some actually believe in what it says and practice the principles of Saul Alinsky (even if you don't want to believe it-- get busy and do some ""homework"" on the topic. Facts are facts.)After understanding all of that and seeing the content of this book, if you aren't shocked, may God have mercy on your soul."
1,"This is a complete pile of crap to read but,","is a must read for any and all conservative thinkers. It's pathetic how liberal progressives think, speak and act but the rest of us MUST know where they get the crazy destructive ideas they spew without thinking. If you ever wonder what makes these useful idiots tick, this book is the genesis."
1,Very disturbing but important for all,"Guess what, this is sadly another push for ""unruly"" usage of persuasion and force to push a socialist agenda. And no matter how many countries continue to fall due to this belief system America has taken its path down this road. When we they learn? As long as we elect those who were educated by books and individuals like this, we will never learn (or we'll just learn the hard way...the EXTREMELY hard way). Read this book and understand what is happing to this country, how Obama was educated, what he is doing and what his next steps will be. He ADMITTEDLY recommends this book to our youth. Read it now and understand why this man needs to be taken out of office in 2012!"
1,Would you read a book that gives tribute to the Devil?,"Alinsky's book is prefaced with a tribute to ""the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom - Lucifer.""Would you want to read such a book?"
1,Anti-American Alinsky,"Saul Alinsky is the most un-American intellectual to ever befall 20th century. Pray tell, Mr. Alinsky, what alternative to the American constitution do you envision? Liberals are trapped in toddler mentality-""it's not fair!!!!!!!"" I'll just stomp my feet until I get my way. Mob rules! Sorry liberals, life is NOT fair. And your vision of fairness is the exact opposite of fairness-reward the failures and the cheats and your friends in power, punish the successful and the ones who want to be taught to fish, not given a fish for free. The one thing liberals hate, and base their entire existence rebelling from, is the idea that you can't get something from nothing. This book is dedicated to the devil, Lucifer. Enough said."
1,What Became of Alinsky's Dedication?,"In the original edition, this book is dedicated to Lucifer (as in the devil). Apparently the dedication has now been deleted. I make nothing of Alinsky's silly homage to the ""first rebel""; but it is interesting how the media, utterly incurious about Obama's years as a ""community organizer"" in the Alinsky mode, has overlooked any detail about the influences on Obama's career that might hurt him politically. I read this book in my liberal youth and remember thinking even then that the author is far more interested in overturning a social order he dislikes than actually helping the poor."
4,Obama's Memtor.,"I read the book to see how closely Obama follows his mentor's teachings. I fact, it is closely indeed! Try it to see what you think."
1,We bought it to see what guides so many of our politicians,We rated this book at one star because we do not like his philosophy. We (my wife and I) hate Alinsky's ideas.
5,Know thy enemy.,"Being a conservative, I find it very informative to know what the other side is thinking or more accurately, what they are feeling. I purchased this book to learn of the ten planks of Communism. The Art of War states you must know thy enemy in order to defeat them. I'd suggest you borrow this from someone that has it and read it. The first 1/3 of the book is a sob story and pity party for people that have been wronged. If you need to feel better about your situation in life if you've worked hard and have something to show for it... you will probably not like the first section. The other 2/3 of the book detail ways of getting people to do what you want. I didn't like reading this book."
4,It worked for Obama but not for Hillary,"It's a Radicals wet dream.Obama followed it perfectly....hillary couldn't pull it off, her smile was too phony"
2,Recipe for chaos and confusion,"Disturbing, but illuminating - like shining a flashlight into a garbage pail. If only this book were just a visit with the movers and shakers of the 1960's it would be more interesting. But President Obama and his intimates recommend this book today!I was there as a rebellious teenager and loved other books by Jerry Ruben, Abby Hoffman and Chairman Mao. It was titillating to read them, but like Zap comics and nose-hits, most of us grew up and left hell-raising behind. Alinsky bares his soul in the dedication ""to Lucifer""."
3,Rules for Radicals,Rules for Radicals was not as comprehensive as I expected. The rules are applicable to any organizing situation. It was more interesting to ascertain where they were not used in current events and how the rules are used in the book.
4,If only...,"...Americans had read ""Mao's Little Red Book"", China would be a democracy today. Do not let the same thing happen here -- read Saul Alinsky's ""Rules for Radicals"". Understand how your opponent thinks, and how to shape politics."
1,Alinsky was a child,What immature drivel and national stifling is the flotsam. A bitter little spoiled boy was this man. His writings are the same fodder.
1,Radical progressive agenda,This book describes a road to Socialism and Communism. Reads like a play book for the radical left/Obama.
1,Bad Stuff,I had to learn how the crazy kooks got that way. Now I know how they got that way after reading this book.
5,What drove him?,"I wanted to judge for myself if this guy was as unscrupulous as others had portrayed him. He was. But what drove him? Based on his own words I think he just liked the game, the thrill of the hunt, the battle. His Marxism was simply a tool; his excuse for a chosen life. He was not driven by principle, simply lust. I say he was more an anarchist than a crusader."
3,growin grass from roots,"How to organize people to work toward a cause, influence the government and public thought.Sal knows what he's talking about. He's been in the buisness of radical revolution for decades and has organized many of the top left wing groups we hear about. This book and its strategies are being used efectively.No matter which side you're on, this will help."
3,History of a significant approach to political matters,"The book is clearly written and summarized by the title. Alinsky, the doyen of Chicago style community organizers, argues that whether the ends justify the means is to be decided by the immediate circumstances. He provides several examples where he answers ""Yes"" to the question of whether the ends justify the means, showing how means some might consider ""bad"" served ""good"" ends. An interesting read whether or not you believe the tactics of recent and current Chicago style community organizers are consistent with Alinsky's guidance."
3,"Preachy, but could be worth your time.","Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky is a bit long-winded and preachy. But, if you can hang in there with the sermonizing, Saul reveals some terrific insights into the strategic mind of the activist.Published in 1971, one who is familiar with activist strategies and tactics can see how Saul's rules have been applied in the intervening years. If you're an activist monitor and forecaster, the observations may stand as testimony to what activists may do in the future. Thus, the book is worth the time of anyone involved with activism on either side of the protest placard."
4,To Understand the Enemy,To understand the enemy we must understand how they think and the rules they follow. This book is the blueprint that Obama and other socialists follow to ruin this once great country of ours. Read it and learn so we can stop the madness that is the liberal left.
3,Radically too Long,"I was so excited to read this book. When it finally came from the library I couldn't open the cover fast enough. What was it in this book that impressed Hillary Clinton and influenced President Barack Obama?This book took me over one month to read. It's 200 pages and reading it should have been no more than a week. Even with two kids. Needless to say, the book should really be a pamphlet.When I finally made it to the rules, guides, and how-to-dos, I was intrigued.So is this book a Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals? Sure. I found it insightful, but could have used without the long-drawn out stories. I recommend you read it regardless if you agree with Mr. Alinsky or not. It never hurts to challenge yourself."
2,The Enemy Within,If you want to beat someone bigger than you it is foolish to take them head on when you can easily win the war from the inside. This is clearly the way radicals can force change by assimilating into the status quo. If they fit right in you will not even detect their intentions to turn control into their favor. While I detest many of the radical ideas of wealth redistribution and `government as caretaker' I have to admit they are using the tools available to make change while the rest of us sleep. To beat the enemy you must understand them. That is what the radicals do to be successful and the rest of us need to understand that or we wake up to a world that is foreign to us. This book may help you do just that.... a low score because I do not like the author. Too bad for him.
4,Prince and Pauper Alinsky captures a moment with true ease,"Like the Prince, Rules for Radicals sets a course for action that emphasizes the extreme to draw attention to the point. A great read for the wit offered by Alinsky, an opportunity to learn if the mind opens to see the possabilities of change."
3,A look into the mind of a social activist,Bought and read the book (twice) is get a better insight into how Barack Obama intends to take over the country. Fits the current governments ideology to a the letter.
3,Rules for Radicals,"I'm browsing it for background, to understand current socialist movement in this country. Book is a good value from Amazon."
1,Good service on a tough subject,"The item arrived as promised with accurate and quick turnaround. I haven't gotten around to reading it because I'm not sure I can stomach it, but I have only a beef with the author, not with the seller."
1,If you follow this book your headed in the wrong direction,"The book gives immoral advice for how to deal with political opponents. A similar read to Machiavelli's The Prince, but Alinkski is completely serious without the irony Machiavelli employs. A truly awful read, probably one of the biggest reasons for our divisive political environment."
1,Keep your friends close and enemies closer,"It's nice to have the left's playbook in print so the moderates can parry some of the junk (science, politics, education, etc.). What upsets me most is that this book has been available for quite some time and the right or center never sought it out to counter-revolutionize these so-called revolutionaries.Apparently, we (the not left [just left of center is not included]) are a hundred years behind and have some educating to do to ourselves, local government, state government, and [OH YES] fecal, I mean federal government."
1,read it only to understand their thinking,"Contradiction after contradiction, but that's okay according to the author, don't do as I do (sheep) do as I say. The quotes used are usually out of context unless it is quoting an idol of his or some other governing style that we are not. Long winded explanations when it's convenient to his cause but cut short, a sentence or two so not to shoot down his arguements. The USA of the late 60's early 70's was a different world than today. Any so blind to think what is contained in these pages applies to today is as blind as those who follow as sheep. Oddly, many of the few valid arguements are what all should apply to their leaders, or apply to a conservative scheme of thought."
1,Rules For Destroying America,"Saul Alinsky dedicates his book, ""Rules for Radicals"" to Lucifer.""Ridicule,is man's most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, who then react to your advantage.""~Saul Alinsky""The American people will never knowingly adopt socialism, but under the name of liberalism they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program until one day America will be a socialist nation without ever knowing how it happened.""- Norman Thomas, American socialistThis book is Barack Hussein Obama's bible. Why else would he and his radicals never address any issue without the cheap insults of racist, xenophobe, ignorant, bitter or homophobe? This book explains it all. They are just too radical and downright snobbish and intellectually lazy to debate and win issues. These are rules for children foot-stompers."
2,book,THe overall condition of the book was fine. The previous owner had written in the margins and circled parts that were interesting to them. Hard to concentrate when going through marks someone else has laid down.
2,Could have been a 25-page book,"Alinsky could have said everything of importance in this book in about 25 pages. The remaining 200 pages are war stories and examples he uses to show how much smarter he was than the rest of us. And he does it in a very paternalistic fashion, much in the style of the older professor tutoring a freshman. Tedious."
4,Rules for Radicals,"Rules for Radicals author, Saul Alinsky, is wiley, intelligent and fairly convincing. It becomes evident that the Clintons were educated with this point of view, and obvious that Barack Obama has lifted the strategy and verbiage of Saul Alinsky."
5,Eye opener,"Radicals are fighting a war. Therefore, any means that is useful, may be employed. Ethics are not important. To win, and then rewrite history to suit themselves, is how it has always been done. Alinsky studied all the past masters. He read all their books going back to ancient times. He professed great reverence for Mao, Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler,Castro, Gueverra etc. He never addressed the fact that these physcopaths enjoyed killing millions of people. That it gave them sexual pleasure. Alinsky seems to have had sex problems of his own. He understood how to manipulate people into believing things that were not true. He could get people to give him their money and power. He carefully documents that and passes the knowledge on so others can emulate him and tear down capitalism and put some kind of socialism in its place."
3,A must read for conservatives,"Consider reading this book as a conservative to better understand the liberal political strategy. Many of President Obama's comments and Mrs. Obama's public comments can be mapped back to ""Rules for Radicals"". It is essential to understand from where their ideas come from. Please note that the rating of this book is irrelevant to the content. My point of view is that of a social conservative trying to better understand the current progressive movement. If this is what you are seeking, I would give the book 5-stars, and highly encourage you to critically read it."
2,NEA recommends this book.,Guess that tells you something. . . .[...]I gave it a two stars because it tells us about how a political faction think.
1,rules for radicals,"I wanted to find out what the book was talking about.I was unable to do so, as I never received the book.The book was sent via the USPS.The USPS said they never received it.So, I never got it.After this, I bought the book from someone else. (monkies07)THEY shipped the book by USPS, and I got the book in 2 DAYS."
2,eeeeehhhhh,"Heard this book was linked to Mr. Obama, so thought I'd read it. The book is old, written in the '70's. Some of the language that was slang back then is outdated. Some of the examples of causes given in the book (integration, unions) have gone by the wayside.The lessons taught in the book are about stirring the populace into action using the tools at hand (people and time) if a community organizer does not have power or money to affect change.The good ""take away"" lesson learned from this book is what a community organizer does (I had no idea what that meant during the last presidential campaign).Would not recommend this book as a good bedtime read. ""Radicals"" of today need a more modern book!"
2,Rules For Radicals,"Since when has Marxism disguised itself as ""Social Change""? Shall we also desribe Commissar as ""Community Organizer"".Very few books have caused such a profound change in social activism as ""Rules for Radicals"". The intense yearning to alleviate human suffering at the hands other humans, will it seems cause yet more intense suffering by the hands of those yearning to stop it.My copy is a hot commodity these days and I'll no doubt have to replace it along with several other Alinsky titles I once owned. I do recommend this title if only to understand how arguments for these actions are formulated by such an erudite mind.BTW: What happened to the dedication to LUCIFER in the forward of the book? Certainly censorship was not forced."
5,Obama is following this to the letter!,"This opened my eyes to exactly what the Occupier of the White House is doing to destroy our country. It is a blue print for the destruction of our great Republic and things are clear now. When people say ""how can Obozo do this that is stupid"", you will realize that he is doing it on purpose as that is how Saul Alinsky says it should be done to break down our great Republic. Every American should read this to understand EXACTLY what is going on and then purchase ""Rules for Radicals Defeated: A Practical Guide for Defeating Obama"". I just ordered that and have to read it. My advice: just buy them, read them, make your own decisions. If you love America and what it was founded on and it's principles of hard work to succeed, then you know what you must do."
1,Rules for Radicals?!...more like Rules for Hypocrites,"Saul Alinsky's book, ""Rules for Radicals"", lays out some practical points. Unfortunately, many are contradicted in other parts of the book. His moral relativism seems to grant permission for adherents to his philosophy to do anything they want, as long as it fits their ""cause"". This is, sadly, all too apparent in the actions of those currently in political power in the US. Alinsky's methods are being applied, and they are dishonest, duplicitous, and dangerous.""Rules for Radicals"" is a valuable insight into how our constitutional form of government is being systematically destroyed."
3,worth the read!,"The book Rules for Radicals, by Saul Alinsky was an interesting look at community organizing. Alinsky offers his unfettered perspective on what it takes for individuals and communities to achieve power. Alinsky explains how his aversion to manners is not just to be ""lude"", but to embrace honest communication and confrontation. The book has several lists of what it takes to be an organizer. Although these lists provide insight and guidelines to achieving power in communities, I believe his short stories of communities achieving or failing to achieve power help to convey his message of bringing power to the people."
1,Know thy enemies,"Wouldn't you like to read Hillary Clinton's thesis from Welesly about this communist that dedicated this book to Lucifer? And these are the people who are soooo much smarter than us and should lead us. Oh, and Barack taught this as a Law reader at the University of Chicago.And yes, you and your children and grandchildren are screwed, because these people just don't care."
1,Obama's Bible,I now see how Obama rose to power: This book is his Holy Bible. Obama's copy must be dogged eared.Obama's narcissistic pursuant of power and retaining power comes from this book.
3,Interesting,"I find it interesting that no one knew who Saul Alinsky was until Fox news and their cohorts made him out to be the boogie man in today's political circus.Politicians needs a boogie man to spread their fear and war mongering.Think for yourselves people and question authority. Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening, terrorizing fact that we don't know who we are, or where we are going in this Ocean of chaos, it has been the authorities, the political, the religious, the educational authorities, informing in our minds their view of reality. To think for yourself you must question authority and learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness; chaotic, confused, vulnerability to inform yourself."
1,Handy for Conservatives,"Of course Saul Alinsky is a ""must read"" for Conservatives and Libertarians...but don't expect to enjoy it.Alinsky must be credited with the success of the ""marxist community organizing movement"" that infects our country like a virus...and therefore admitted to be effective, but his writing is execrable, and his thinking is about a millimeter deep.He's a seeker of power, not a man of principle. He makes it clear that the goal is to manipulate and use people for his own ends, not to actually benefit them.But...if we're going to defeat his ubiquitous acolytes we need to know his tactics. (You gotta know the enemy.)This is required reading for all Liberty activists.My advice: buy it used, so as not to enrich the Alinsky estate."
2,Mmb,I really searched for a decent samurai sword for my son's halloween costume on line and was willing to pay more for it. This seemed to be the best I could find. it was inexpensive but cheaply made. The sword does not fit back into the sheath properly. I saw plenty of similar items at local stores like party city and Halloween express and would recommend you settle on one of them to save the shipping cost.
3,over priced,"The product was not totally what I expected for $85 (shipping to Canada included). The bag is generic (except it has metal, rather than plastic, clips which are nice) and the sleeve is not as padded as the picture/description would have you believe. it is an average product with a high price. Good but not worth the price."
1,Bait & Switch,"Artwork makes the buyer believe what they get is music with Goofy - instead what you get is a collection of uninspired, third rate, low budget cover arrangements with equally uninspiring performers - and NO GOOFY - NO MICKEY - NO CHARACTERS AT ALL! - total RIP-OFF! - this is junk and I feel like I just got pick-pocketed by Disney - it is a classic bait and switch; show one thing and switch it for something completely inferior - DON'T BUY THIS!"
2,Not what I expected,I bought this CD as a gift for my granddaughter who loves to dance. The concept was perfect but the quality of the cd was not. They had a lot of tunes I myself recognized that I thought sure she would enjoy. But the songs were not done in an upbeat sort of way so it left us a bit disappointed. We'll keep trying other disney products.
5,Great Reference of Electrotherapy,"This book has a lot of good information with references. It is a great handbook for acupuncturists, especially who are considering to use Electrotherapy (Electro-Acupoint Treatment) as a part of their practice. I particularly like the diagrams and charts. It is well organized."
1,***WARNING FOR GEN5 IPODS***,"After reading all the reviews I could find online, I thought this would be a perfect solution for a work related application. I have a 5th generation 30GB video iPod, a model which their website claims it supports. My first purchase turned out to be a dud or so I thought and I exchanged it for another. Only after I called their customer support did I find out that the 5th gen 30GB video iPod is not supported. Not yet at least and that a new firmware is needed and is being worked on and will be released SOMETIME next year. Needless to say, I'm EXTREMELY annoyed that nothing like this has been stated by the company in ANY way."
1,Best in Show at MacWorld,"Based on this, I had high hopes for the iSee 360i and was perhaps one of the first ones to get this item and try it out. I may be the ONLY one so far, because as of this date I couldn't find a single other mainstream review. Now I may know why: it's a complete dud. I could not get it to work in the slightest with my 60GB video iPOD. Depending on the iPOD you have, there are adapters that must be ordered seperately, because quite unbelieveably, they are not included. To add further insult to injury, the instructions are vague and did not make clear (at least to me) which iPOD should be used with this unit without having to order adapters. Needelessly to say, I returned it almost immediately. I would defintely say that the iSee is not ready for Prime Time!"
1,RIP OFF,"According to company literature, this device supports 5G iPod (with Video). After receiving it as a gift, however, I have since learned that it does NOT support 5G iPods with video. I feel cheated by the Company - if their product is not compatible with the devices they state it is, they should make it clear before anyone buys it. Absolutely atrocious behavior. Save your money for a company that deserves it."
1,Buyer Beware !! isee NOTHING,"I thought , what a great idea - and would have been if it worked,there was no mention of needing adapters, that should have been a given.I loaded the software on THREE ,countum, THREE computers and could notget the product to work on any of the ,THREE ipods i tried.I just received the error WAITING ON IPOD TO MOUNT on the nanothe other two ,it didn't see them at all.THIS PRODUCT iSEE 360i IS LOADED WITH PROBLEMS FROM START TO FINISHThe only thing i accomplished was a HEADACHE !Please save your money."
2,Humvee twin pack of shaker lights,"These are the 1st shaker lights I have ever tried , so , I have nothing else to compare them with previously. The big one seems to work OK. Visible , usable light is available after shaking for 1 min.If the small one is not defective , a set of night vision googles would be necessary for it to be useful and visible. I am strongly considering checking out Amazon's return policy.Update (2-18-09): I returned both flashlights and ""took it in the shorts"". The little one is worthless and the big one is ok. Vendor told me the little one was not defective. I would have gotten more satisfaction if I'd put the little one under the tire of a Humvee , driven over it , and kept the big one. :>("
4,"Good, Bad, or Ugly","I have yet to read the book as a whole but I can say this. if the rest of the book is like the first three chapters then you are in for a real treat. the book is jam packet with anything and everything that could help you become a good teacher simply by helping you understand the realm of including children with special needs into your class room. but as i told other friends of mine the book will only help you go your way the true path to being a teacher starts at your heart, if you dont have it there you will never have it no matter how book smart you are. but the books help and so does this one."
5,A Useful Resource,"This book has a great core philosophical message. In addition, the authors provide a number of exmaples that teachers can use as they begin to implement inclusive practices in their classrooms and schools. Well done - I use this in my methods classes."
5,Wow!,"I agree with other reviewers that the books have too many minor characters to keep up with, but the books are worth reading anyway. This was the best so far. I loved ""seeing"" Dennis change! I also enjoyed ""visiting"" with Rhonda and Jed from the first book. I can't wait to read the next two books in this series. I love the way Ms. Herman shows how faith works in the lives of her characters and how the Holy Spirit deals with lost souls."
1,Rotten Waste of Money!,"This book is 48 pages. What you can't know until this title comes in the mail is that those pages are each about palm of hand size. Each page has one symbol, (some drawn poorly, to boot!) with a sentence about the significance of each. In total, there are only about 30 symbols covered. That is about .20 cents per hieroglyphic. I cannot say enough negative things about this pamphlet. The information provided is found within the first page or so of any self respecting book on the Ancient Egyptian language. Save yourself the money and the frustration. Instead, check out ""How To Read Egyptian Heiroglyphics"" by Mark Collier."
5,Something Special from Zatarain's - Dehydrated Sweet Dried Bell Pepper,"How many times have you used fresh bell pepper and wanted to save it for other dishes. You cut them up and put them in the freezer but once thrawed out the taste wasn't up to par or you forgot they were in the veggie bin and once you remember them they were beyond saving. Well, now you can have a very favorable seasoning anytime you are ready. This is the product to use. From eggs, stews, sandwiches, vegatables, etc., they are delicious! They add the extra something and absolutely make your meals pop. They never last long in your pantry."
2,Doesn't ship well,The fragile hooks whick hold the bin against the pegboard break off during shipping. The company who shipped the item did give me a timely refund.
3,Tool Peg Board,This is a nice little tray but it protrudes from the pegboard quite a bit. I first installed on the lower section of my peg board but it stuck out to far above my work bench. I have a 4 ft. power strip below the peg board and above my work bench and the tray made it very hard to use the power strip. I moved it up higher but then it was hard to see what was in the tray. I ended up cutting the tabs off it and mounted it directly to the side of my work bench. Much better location for my work bench.
5,Pegboard and Parts Tray,Works wonderful and holds a lot of items that can clearly be seen and are handy.
5,cool,I bought these for my shop and really like them. My tool area is really cleaned up now. There is plenty of room for odds and ends and tools to fit in the holes.
3,"Organize, not measure","This sturdy parts tray holds many items but the measuring tool is barely readable. If you are just looking for a basic tray with potential for sorting, this is it."
3,Pegboard organiser,"Using ""wall control"" pegboard you will need to remove the pegs in each corner to get it to fit. The screwdrivers cannot sit square the holes are too close together, handles collide. Also the smaller screwdriver holes all needed enlarging, to get mechanics screwdrivers (with hex drive at top of blade) to fit where I wanted them to be. Plus I used wall control pegs to add some extra support underneath. Bear in mind longer screwdrivers need more room above to extract them, meaning you have wasted space on the pegboard... Its a great organiser when adapted!"
1,Pegs Broken Off,"Although cheap in price, it would be nice to receive itwith all the pegs intact.Pegs break off when you install it on pegboard. Wasteof money. Better off to visit your local Lowes to seeit before you buy it."
3,A snapshot into a lost world,"Breakdown and Bereavement is novel marked literary by high-highs and low-lows, and in the middle, gives an excellent snapshot of the world which existed in Palestine in the waning days of Ottoman rule before the coming of the British and their mandate, and the rising nationalistic aspirations of the Jewish settlers and the Arab inhabitants. In Breakdown and Bereavement Jerusalem is a sleepy backwater; an Asian town, the Jews living untouched by Zionism, and still reliant of international charity for their living. The novel presents a stark picture of Jewish life in early 20th century Palestine: poverty, uncouth living, and the smallness of life, are all on display, giving this novel a veracity which other accounts of the early days of Zionism do not possess. The shtetl lives on in the capital of Judaism. With all that, this is still a flawed novel, going on a bit long in places where it should be short, and treating weighty subjects in too short a span."
5,Saturday Night Rock at Its Best,"If anyone feels better than an American on Saturday night, it's a Texan on Saturday night... just listen to ""Louisiana Cockfight"" for proof. Almost all of Side 1 features some of the best early 70s power-trio ever recorded. Kick-ass drumming too (from a gurl).Do yourself a gigantic favor and listen to Side 1 of this immediately followed by Dust's self-titled album. Then do your damnedess to build a time machine to go back to 1971."
3,"USDA approved, grain-fed Rock","Obscure but rewarding set of 70's hard rock, Texas style. Singer-songwriter-guitarist John Nitzinger struck out on his own after writing some songs for fellow Texan rockers Bloodrock and produced ""Nitzinger"" in 1972. Not quite as bluesy as Johnny Winter, Nitzinger could write some good poppy hooks within the hard rock context, which leads to speculation on what ""could have been"" (think .38 Special or Molly Hatchett). The most memorable song is ""Witness To The Truth"", which sounds like a ""lost classic"" upon first listen. The bad news about this particular import version is that it was obviously taken from a vinyl source, as a couple song intros are tellingly faded up in a rather sloppy fashion. ""Four stars"" for the contents."
2,Not very useful,"This dvd was a letdown not only was it short but it lacked substance.This guy has a strange vibe and talks too much about solos being like conversations and that if you ""talked all at once"" you would not be heard.....really? wow thanks for the hot tip!.There is little time spent on useful scales(other than the same old tripe) and current rock and blues solo structure is left out completely.He does play one or two recognizable licks like the solo from Rod Stewarts Maggie May but any second year player could do better than that.You would be far better of to learn from Danny Gill,Stuart Bull,Jammie Huphries or Greg Koch if you want real meat and taters.Look around first before you buy this Duck!!.PS"
3,Fine as expected. . . .BUT,"Chicago is just a book that anyone in publishing needs. This edition has an excellent added grammar section and a very good ""use of words"" list.BUT. One of the most helpful aspects of previous editions has been destroyed. Previous editions had an nearly unimaginable helpful table of word hyphenation. I know people who bought CMS on the basis of that table.In the 15th edition, the table has been replaced by a very difficult to read and scan list. The list has good information but is really tedious.It's a shame that the hard work that went into revision has been negated by this egregious choice. Production departments are abuzz is disappointment.It's even more shameful that users have to wait 10 years for the probelem to be fixed by returning to the table."
1,it's all in the premise,"Any book which prescribes ""style"" for you, has proscribed the attainment of it.Get this book. Read it. Write. Hurrah for tabloid amorphalism!tlt-"
4,Good value for the money,I bought a used edition of the Chicago Manual of Style. I got a book in good condition at a fair price. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
2,Messed Up,When the book arrived it was half soaked like it had been dropped into a bucket of water. Maybe it was the post office - I don't know. I dried it out as much as possible.Not a good experience.
4,Reads remarkably well,"I expected a rather dry composition of rules. Instead, the examples are usually both somewhat lively and useful. In addition, on occassion the deep structure of our language peeks thru, providing insights into the way English compositors think. The utility of the tome is limited, however, by the exhaustive depth and breadth of the subject: finding a relavent rule for a particular topic can be confusing. There is definite lack of emphasis on the fluidity of language as a mode of communication. Finally, the book lacks a sppell checker."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE with Windows Vista!,"This is ridiculous! CMoS wrote in an e-mail today:""[...] The CMOS CD Rom is not compatible with Vista. We recommend that customers using Vista look at our online product [...]""Thus, the CMoS CD-ROM of the 15th edition is NOT COMPATIBLE with a system that has been on the market for more than three years now. Other publishers launched recommended patches for Vista as early as in 2006!I get the feeling that CMoS just wants to sell their overprized online version. This is bad business behavior!"
5,Excellent,Everything you need to put into a book - I never realized there were so many things to consider. I received the book in great condition and on time.
5,Everyone who writes should have this,I love this manual. I'm not telling anyone anything new when I say this is a must have resource for consistent quality writing.
5,The Gold Standard,What is there to say about a classic and standard that hasn't already been said before. This book is the OED (Oxford English Dictionary) in its field.
4,Encumbered by an incredible amount of information,"Most people I know who use the Chicago Manual of Style swear by it - I'm still getting used to it, myself. It's certainly thorough, but that means it has way more information than many people will be interested in, and it's a bit intimidating. I've found the index to be not entirely intuitive. But you can't argue with the content or authority. I occasionally flip through just for kicks, and often end up finding rules that make me think, ""There's a rule for *that*? Who knew?"""
4,Great reference in an everchanging world,"This is a great book. It provides a broad range of information on style. I use it mostly for formatting references in journal articles (I'm a journal editor). It does have a good amount of international information, too, though has some limits for people who are not living or writing in America--for example, in titles and honorifics, it breaks down right to the municipal level in US, but not in other countries.Two things I would like to see. First is a hearty softcover edition (this is heavy enough and I carry it a lot of places to do work.Second is some kind of ability, once you've bought the book, to access the on-line version, which includes both all of the information in the book, and a full range of advice on a variety of other issues that readers have brought to their attention. The two in tandem are the ultimate style resource."
5,Recommended,Received book in condition specified in description. Book was received in a reasonable amount of time.
3,Mixed Review,"I had to buy this book for an editing class I'm taking at school. It's a nice book to look at--they've done a great job with the layout--and the sections you need really aren't that hard to find. The thing that I can't understand is who made the University of Chicago the all-powerful English prescriptivists? I realize that there needs to be uniformity in writing (a lot of it, probably), and I recognize that Chicago does allow for some flexibility of choice in certain areas, but I think it is often too nit-picky. Maybe that's just because I don't understand the rules very well or I don't have any real-life editing experience. My feelings about it are very mixed. Sorry I don't have much of a definitive review, but I will say that I loved when another professor of mine saw me with the book and told me ""That is a book I refuse to open!"""
4,Good Resource,"I bought this book because my university relies on the Chicago Manual of Style's formatting for dissertations and such. It's a good reference for writing dissertations and papers. In areas where formatting is still somewhat not standardized (such as audio recordings, websites), this manual provides general guidelines of what information should be included. The section on electronic resource is quite applicable although more examples would be helpful."
4,CMS disk,"I have found it helpful. I work from two different places, depending on my assignment. I have the hard copy in one place and the CD-ROM in another. I know the CMS like the back of my hand anyway, but being able to type in a word and go straight to the particular article makes it very quick for me when I need to cite the particular article numbers for changes that I mark."
5,The Book of Armaments,"This indispensable volume is one of the finest books written for writers and editors of all time. One of its nicest features is that it is actually a joy to read. I particularly enjoy this version due to its added usage guide. I eagerly anticipated its release (to the point of pre-ordering it) and have been well rewarded with its purchase. I would recommend it for anyone who wishes to do ""well"" instead of ""good."""
2,"Make Sure You Buy the 14th Edition, First","The info you want and need is in the 14th Edition -- stick with that one and you'll never go wrong. This is like the ""new coke."" The 15th Edition seems to be an edition made different if only for the sake of being different (and, of course, to justify making money after a certain amount of years have passed since the 14th was published). I fear for the next generation if the 14th Edition were to become unavailable. I'm willing to bet the 16th Edition will very similar to the 14th, and only include the truly useful from the 15th (of which, I think, there is little)."
5,The Favorite On Usage,"This megatome on usage is the preferred manual by many in the business of writing, though others prefer the AP Style Guide.This book will tell you whether to spell out the number ""ten"" or use the number ""10,"" whether a comma goes inside or outside of quotation marks, and which word is correct, further or farther.Of course, you can avoid all of these issues if you just hire a ghostwriter-- in which case you might want to order ""Write a Book Without Lifting a Finger: How to Hire a Ghostwriter Even if You're on a Shoestring Budget."""
4,Important but confusing,"This book is necessary for understanding how to cite works using Chicago style, but it can be confusing and unclear. However it has many example sections which I found useful."
4,If only Meat Loaf would have sung...,"A must for everybody who loves ""Bat Out Of Hell"".It is the only legitimate sequel to the ultimate adolescent phantasy.Although Jim Steinman's voice can't match Meat Loaf's, it has a certain charm of its own.In lieu of grandeur you'll find a certain innocence, which matches the underlying theme equally well."
3,"music = 4 stars, singing 2 stars = 3","Steiman is a great composer , arranger, and I think there is some great music on this CD; however his voice is too weak to make this a keeper... interesting.. parts of this could make a great Great album with another voice..."
4,No Meatloaf ? - get over it!,"OK, I'll admit it. The first time I listened to the album I thought ""boy if only Meatloaf did this"". After about the third time through I was thinking ""geez Jim sounds pretty damn good to me"". Had Meatloaf done this album I think it would have been to much of a ""Bat out of Hell"" clone; Jim's vocals give the album a slightly different feel. I would have given this album five stars, but ""Dance in my Pants"" is awful - it tries to be ""Paradise by the Dashboard Light"" but sounds more like a cheezy 50's style show put on at a theme park.P.S. - I have heard Meatloaf versions of many of these songs and I consistantly prefer the tracks of this album."
3,For Steinman nuts only,"As professional reviewers said at the time of release, without someone with the presence of Meat Loaf to sing his anthems, Jim Steinman is at a loss. But to the true Steinmaniac (I invented that word), his vocal limitations just add a whole new level to the mythology. When it comes to arena-size heroics, the man is, was, and will always be a great writer."
3,"This is the ""could have been"" follow up to Bat out of Hell","Jim Steinman penned two albums in 1981, Bad For Good and Meat Loaf's Dead Ringer. Bad For Good has many of the great qualities of its predecessor, ""Bat Out Of Hell"" including teenage anthems, full orchestral accompaniment and over the top production. Songs like ""Left in the dark"" and ""Bad For Good"" would fit grandly into any Meat Loaf album. Unfortunately, Steinmans vocals pale in comparison to Mr Loaf. If you were to combine elements of Dead Ringer and Bad For Good, you would have one heck of an album."
4,Scratches the itch for more Meatloaf,"Since this was supposed to be Meatloaf's followup to Bat out of Hell, it is easy for me to imagine what this album could have achieved with Meat's searing vocals fronting kick ass songs such as Bad for Good, Surf's Up, and the songs which ended up also on Bat II. Regardless, Jim Steinman, as always, shows the ability to effortlessly Rock, sooth, and simply astound with his arrangements. I wouldn't be surprised to see some of these songs end up on the soon to be released Meatloaf's Greatest Hits."
2,Just not the same....,"Great songwriter, lousy singer. Everyone should have one talent and Jim Steinman clearly has several; but singing is not one of them.The second problem with this album is that 90% of the songs can be found scattered on Meat Loaf's various albums -- and sung and arranged much better. It's too bad -- the lyrics are fantastic but this just isn't a good CD to listen to."
4,Best music,"This album is one of the best that my husband and I own we bought it on vinyl,cassette and cd. We took it with us when we had our first child it was our music especially rock and roll dreams come though it was our song."
1,Bad is really Bad,"What makes Jim Steinman think he can sing? His songs are great, but best sung by people who actually can carry a tune like Meatloaf, Bonnie Tyler, Celine Dion, etc."
1,Title says it all,"The title says it all. The album is bad. REALLY BAD. Nothing can change that. Is is bad for good.Stienman is, whitout a doubt the single worst producer in recorded music history. His bombastic, overwrought style should never have been allowed to be recodred.But this is not all. His songs are just as bad. A song like ""Rock and Roll Dreams"" is simply horrific. That this album is still in print after nearly 20 years is shameful."
1,Nightmares,"To this day, this album remains a part of my nightmares. It is horrible. It is the worst. Mere words cannot descibe just how terrible it is. Avoid. For heaven's skae, avoid."
4,CD Tracks Are Out of Order,"Stupid geeky concern, but I feel obligated to point out - for those who care to think about such things - that the tracks on the CD are out of order. When the album was released in '81, it was accompanied by an EP with ""The Storm"" as the A side, and ""Rock and Roll Dreams"" as the B side. The disc indicated that ""Storm"" was intended to be a ""prologue"" to the album, while ""Rock and Roll Dreams"" was intended to be an epilogue. So what you gotta do, I mean to really appreciate the album as the director intended you to, is listen to ""Storm,"" then the album, then ""Rock and Roll Dreams""Come on, you know you care."
4,Bad for good,"The only reason that I didn't give this album 5 stars is that Meatloaf obvoiusly doesn't sing any of the songs. On the positive side of that, some of the songs from here are re-released on Bat out of Hell II, with vocals by Meatloaf--the standout on BOOHII being Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through. It's amazing how much not having Meatloaf sing changes the songs so drastically. Steinman is not bad at all by any means, and he gives it all he's got, but he just can't compare to Meatloaf. His voice just lacks the power and range. I wish they would have redone the song Bad For Good on Bat out of Hell II, I'd really like to hear Meatloaf sing that one, it's one of Steinman's best songs ever. The rest of the album is really quite good, but Steinman alone is like Meatloaf alone, they need each other to make the magic happen. All in all, this album is very enjoyable, if you are a fan of Steinman's work, you will not be disappointed in this."
2,"Jim, don't quit your day job!","I have to admit to being a major Meatloaf fanatic, and being one, I had to check out Jim's album for reasons anyone knowing either one one the two should be obvious. What can I say? The songs are great, if woefully under-produced for Jim's vocal efforts. The writing is terrific. But Jim can't sing - not like Meatloaf, not even passably. He's got an interesting voice, good for theatre, but I've heard better singing efforts at my local Karaoke bar. The Storm is a great orchestral piece, but you can get tmoe of that, (and less of Jim's singing) on other albums."
3,"Not ""Bat Out of Hell"", But Not Bad","Jim Steinman was frustrated by his lack of success after Meat Loaf's ""Bat Out of Hell."" From that frustration came this album. It carries the right pedigree, but the genes have worn thin in it's generation. Brilliantly written, yet lacking the emotion that Meat Loaf was able to bring to the party. Best track is easily ""Rock & Roll Dreams Come Through"", but I prefer the version on ""Bat Out Of Hell 2: Back Into Hell"". This seems like the warm up act for Loaf."
2,Great composer - average singer,"I am a big fan of Jim Steinman's work. Meatloaf, Bonnie Tyler, Celine Dion, Streets of Fire - all great. I like the songs on this CD I just don't think he has the voice to really pull them off. Alot of the songs were redone by meatloaf on later albums - guess I would say go with one of them."
5,"The one, the original...","Ok, so he doesn't quite sound like MeatLoaf, but this guy's the real genius behind the music."
3,Good Value for Money. - Under powered,I bought this for music in my toddlers room. For that purpose I think this is fine. Takes very little space. Is easy to use. Its cheap so if he breaks it I won't vent as much :-).For any other purpose I would say this is an extremely under powered system.
2,It's fine when it works,"Here's another example of a product that has features available only on the remote control. Once the remote quits, you are out of luck. The first remote worked for about 8 months. The replacement the company sent worked for two days. I'm awaiting the third replacement; it's been six weeks and I fully expect I won't ever receive one. So the unit works well and the sound is fine, but I I can't set the sleep, repeat, or shuffle funcitons. I won't ever buy another Philips product."
5,great buy,We bought this for our teenaged daughter-who wasn't sure where she was going to put it- it can easily be mounted on the wall- it has front plug ins for mp3 player and the sound quality is pretty good for the priceoverall a good value
2,Very nice item.,"I bought this for my daughter for her B-day.It has the sliding front plate which really appeals to her(andis also impressive to others).There have been no problems with it since it was first used (Sept.06).It also has good sound for the size and a nice remote.Extra space is needed if it is going to be put on a shelf,but it is also wall mountable. I recommend this item."
4,My wife loves it.,Bought this unit for my wife for Christmas. She wanted a stereo in the kitchen. She loves it and uses it almost every day. The sound is more then adequate for the kitchen. Set up quickly and very user friendly.
4,pretty good,"I have had this for about a year and it has worked well. I specifically bought it to tune into radio, so I have not used the CD player and whatever functions it might have. Pretty light, 7 of 10 sound quality, can hang on wall, detachable speakers. Good for cost. I would recommend and buy for a gift."
4,"Good, but a few flaws","Bought this system to go in the baby's room, which dictated a wall-mount system. Overall, the system is good, and provides decent sound quality. But there are, in my opinion, a few design flaws:* LCD backlight goes out when system is in standby mode. This wouldn't be a big deal, but that's when it shows a clock, so you can't read it in low light.* Station presets are lost with brief power outages. Presets could have been stored in flash memory or with some capacitors for backup. Even the option to plug in a 9V battery like a clock radio would have worked.* When wall-mounting, there aren't enough wire routing channels on the rear to accomodate the way I wanted things configured."
2,fun while it lasted,"I purchased this for my wife's studio about 8 months ago; about 2 months ago the CD door started to stick and was difficult to close; now the CD player stopped recognizing CD's altogether; it is now just an AM/FM radio. Looks nice, but function came in second to form."
4,Great for the price.,"I just bought this stereo Jan 2006. The price was right. It can play MP3 CDR/RW. The radio is alittle difficult to setup. I am the type that doesn't read the manual. I guess I will need to read the manual to figure it out. Also, there is no MIC, so to connect an ipod to it requires buying a more expensive adapter. But hey, you have the MP3 function already. Just play and forget about it.I highly recommend this product for simple needs."
2,Looks Good...Sounds Mediocre,"Really a great-looking item, sleek and unobtrusive. Remote is extremely slim, but needs backlit buttons. I returned mine for two reasons:1. Overall sound is VERY cheap. An old, inexpensive Sony boombox I own sounds much better.2. Volume control: The lowest setting is too loud for relaxing (we had ours in the bedroom.)Unless you plan to only look at the stereo rather than listen to it, get something else."
4,OK,"Looks good, sounds ok. The dynamic bass boost introduces hiss but makes the sound more bassy. 4 stars for looks and price. -1 for sound quality."
4,"Mostly good, but watch out when opening","I got exactly what I expected in the sound quality of this product. I like the looks of the unit, and the size is just perfect. Its nice that you can separate the speakers from the central unit, if you want. I haven't tried to wall mount, so I don't know about that feature. The only downside was the packaging on the inside of the tray where the cd goes was taped on. We didn't realize that it was still sticky, so the first cd we put in was killed by that. We noticed the back was all gummed up, and then cleaned off the tape. It now works fine. Be aware when you open yours."
1,Wrong info by Amazon. Does NOT fit brake pedal on automatic transmission-equipped cars.,"Wrong info by Amazon. Does NOT fit brake pedal on automatic transmission-equipped cars. And then, Amazon, never replied to my written request for a return ""RMA"" and a refund. The brake pedal for manual-trans cars is different from the pedal for man-trans cars, and this pad does NOT fit both."
1,Poor quality illiustrations,"Though illustrated by Dulac, the illustrations as presented in this Kessinger Publishing edition are extremely disappointing. I don't recommend this edition for anyone seeking to enhance their library."
3,Confused,This smells just like Magnetism to me. I can't tell the differenc. I ordered this product from amazon and I am wondering if they have magnetism perfume in a Magnetic beat bottle. I am going to the department stores to see if this is how Magnetic Beat really smells
1,"Great Shoe, Bad Sizing!","It really is a gorgeous shoe. Unfortunately, the manufacturer's sizing is way off! I ordered a size 9. My size 8 friend could barely squeeze into them. So, I sent them back. If you order really consider going up a couple of sizes."
4,Together we can burn the world,"OK, it's not the stunning power pop of the Posies, but fans of good songwriting can't go wrong with this one. Quieter, more piano, less guitar. But Ken's voice is stronger than ever here, and melodies and images from these songs will linger. The first tune to grab me was ""When U Find Someone,"" sonically a perfect knockoff of Beach Boys harmonies, but dark, initially confusing lyrics about George W driving Saddam to lover's lane, to slip him a cruise missile I presume. The military-sexual metaphor would make Elvis Costello proud, not to mention the earnestly-delivered refrain, ""together we can burn the world."" ""Any Love,"" ""Known Diamond"" and ""Death of a City"" are also standouts."
3,"OK, but not great","This record really isn't as good as his ""Touched"" CD. But there are some songs worth listening to. I wanted to like it more than I did. The songs come off a LOT better live."
2,180 degree turn from earlier work,"Strong caution to anyone buying this hoping to hear ""more"" of Ken Stringfellow. This is more accurately a reincarnated Stringfellow. While the songwriting is interesting and often touching, this release belongs in a category to itself and not beside his other work with Jon Auer. I have never purchased a more highly anticipated cd and then found so many songs unlistenable. To me, the production was lo-fi and distracting at times. I had difficulty getting through or into the highly personal lyrics. One exception is ""Any Love"", which grabbed me right away with the mysterious character described as follows ""we have to wonder what she meant when she told us any love is good enough"". Another is ""Known Diamond"", which has Ken singing naked and soulfully behind the piano. Bottom line: This is a must have for the collectors of Ken Stringfellow's work. It will add to your understanding of the artist, but I doubt you'll find yourself singing any of these tunes afterwards."
3,Pump works great,"I ordered 2 twin-size airbeds. The built-in pump worked great and inflated the beds quickly. Only 1 of the 2 beds lost enough air to be noticeable. My visitors told me the beds were uncomfortable, too small and noisy. I guess whenever they'd move around during the night the beds would make enough noise to actually wake each other up. They said they'd rather sleep on the floor next time. So, 2 of the stars are for not having weekend visitors for a while."
2,holes in the seams,"I have purchased 2 of these beds over 2. Intex makes great pools, so I thought it would be a great bed. the first one had holes ini it after being used for about a week. the second one had holes in 2 or 3 seams after my 60lb son slept on it for about a month. The holes can be fixed with cray glue, but once they start coming, they keep on coming. I am dissappointed that intex makes the seams so weak. Otherwise, it inflates quickly and is comfortable."
2,Only good for 2 weeks,"The pump is not very good, I actally got better results by using the pump that comes with Coleman's air matresses. I's good as a temporary solution but not longer that 2 weeks of continous use. The seams on the upper section start to open and air leaks out rapidly"
2,The Fatal Flaw,"I've had an Intex bed like this for less than a month. I was impressed by how well the pump worked, its general ergonomics, and its comfort. But now it leaks, and I can't find the leak. So I can't use it, and judging from other reviews as well as what policies the various sellers and the manufacturer have, I'm screwed. So why would I buy another one? This isn't going to be a real business until somebody has a 100% lifetime guarantee. Then they'll sell tons of these, and it will more than make up for the costs of replacing the duds."
3,Not for a everyday use,"I've bought this inflatable bed for my father in law visit due we have short space in the house. From day two he told me it looses air overnight, so by the morning it is about 80% its inflation capacity.I think it is good for a weekend every once in a while, but not for more than a week.Other than that, pumps work good both ways."
1,Looks good but bad design,I had this bed three weeks and one of the inner chambers broke loose. I now have a huge bulge running up the entire middle of the bed the long way. It slept ok before it broke. Not the best air bed I ever slept on but not bad. But DON'T BUY IT. It broke and I had to return it. This is the first thing I ever bought from Amazon that I had to return. I was surprised. All stuff from Amazon I am usually satisfied with. They did make returning it very easy.
5,Nice bed,"The bed is pretty comfy, easy to set and blow up. Shipped in a timely manner, only have needed to add a little air about once a week."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MATTRESS,We used this mattress once and it would not stay inflated. The Seller's response to this problem was for us to find a leak and patch it! Amazon.com also failed to help us out.
1,LEAKY,This product leaked from the day it arrived.Intex Comfort Bed - Rising Comfort Twin Airbed with built-in Electric Pump. To no avail from manufacturer or supplier.
1,Very Poor Product,"Sorry to say, but this is the worst I have ever bought from Amazon. Within a month it had holes all over the places and it was hard time for me to continue with this.Very disappointing!"
2,Waste of Money,"The air bed has a lot of trouble staying full. It wasn't so bad for the first week or so, needing refilling upon waking and before going to bed. After that however, the mattress wouldn't hold air and completely deflated within 20 minutes. This was a waste of time and money."
1,Unleavened Bed,"Simply put, this bed does not inflate to 19"" as advertised on the box. It only inflates to 14 inches. Therefore, you will not get the feeling of crawling into an actual bed. However, the sheets do tuck under the top just like an actual bed."
2,Intex Comfort Bed - Rising Comfort Twin Airbed with built-in Electric Pump,Shipping was great the air bed needs to be pumped up before each use: in other words it does not stay firm durning a nights sleep.
4,Perfect hight,"I am very happy with this bed. It inflates in seconds, and the 19 inches height is just perfect. Great material. What I didn't like is that other inflatable beds I've bought before, come with their own fitted sheets with the open space where the cables for the pump are, and with a special elastic which helps it stay in place. This bed did not include the sheets. It is very difficult to find sheets that fit this bed. Also, since there is a lot of air in the bed, it is very difficult to warm it up with the body heat of one person, so you need to keep it by a floor heater."
4,airbed,The product arrived quickly and we used it camping. It worked the way it was supposed to and had a comfortable bed all night
2,Contrived plots - ridiculous characters,"While I really enjoy Regency tales, this one was one I couldn't care less about finishing. The plot twists were contrived and completely unrealistic. The characters were labored - I just could not find myself caring what happened to them. I forced myself to finish the book, wishing throughout the last 50 pages or so that the main characters would just disappear. If you want a good Regency, try Georgette Heyer, Joan Smith, Elizabeth Mansfield, Patricia Veryan or Clare Darcy."
5,Hope-Giving,"Well-researched, wisely compiled, exhaustive in scope, encouraging in result, and providing worshipful hope. James Washington, in the spirit of Harold Carter'sThe prayer tradition of Black people, has collated over 200 prayers, poems, hymns, and stories reflecting the nature of African American spirituality. Lay people and academics will equally benefit from and enjoy this vibrant work.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction ."
5,It doesn't get much better than this.,"A great artist at the top of her form. This recording was made in her late 80's and its better than the stuff she recorded in her younger, more popular days. There's something in her voice/delivery that suggests that ""I might be old - but I know whats going on"" kind of wisdom that only comes when you're singing from the heart, and for the heart. This is an all time classic."
1,Garbage,This is the worst thing I have seen in my life.The signial is weak and it does not do all that is listed.I could do better with coffee cans and some Kite string.Save you money.Thank youRudy
1,Poor transmittion quality,"This product wouldn't transmit clear quality sound from one to the other. It produced static noise on every channel at less than 100 feet. I ended up donating this product because the seller wouldn't take it back, and he/she me referred to the manufacturer (who couldn't find a working solution)."
4,illustrated veterinary anatomical nomenclature,"this is about the easiest book to learn all those hard latin terms and end up being able to relate them to the anatomy of animals, not only one species but heaps of them. before i got this book i had a problem with the latin in used in vet anatomy but after getting to it all seems well and my hopes are raised!"
5,Cute!!,This is a cute item. Even though they are salt and pepper shakers I will use them as decorations instead
2,Huh?,"So, my first question is, why don't the authors ever explain what the CID is, and what the CCDP (Cisco Certified Professional Designer) certification is?This isn't such a bad book, it's just not really right for McGraw-Hill to sell it as an exam prep text.I quite liked it as a general overview to the principles of internet design, but the authors would have been better served with a better publisher. The fact that this 800 page book is as fat as some books twice the page count irks me no end (think of the trees!), as does the gratuitous CD ROM (as near as I can tell, it just has the same ""review"" questions as are included at the end of each chapter).Well-worth reading if you can borrow this one from a library or a friend, but if you have to shell out 60 skins you may not be thrilled with the value."
2,For novices,"A lot of pages wasted on some basic CCNA type of stuff. CCDP is intermediate level and requires deeper knowledge of the subject. It is not enough to pass the real test. Unfortunately there are no other books out there to use accept for Cisco Press, which has a lot of mistakes.Author spends a lot of time talking about the same things, very boring and useless discussions. Feels like politician is trying to teach computer science. You would need more info to pass. Good luck."
1,CID,I just took the CID exam after reading Thomas Thomas's book. I thought I was taking the wrong test after a few questions. The book has some good networking examples but completely misses the test target. Its the worst book I have EVER used to take a Cisco test. Don't waste your money if you want to pass the test.
4,Stephanies Ponytail,I liked this book. It was nice. I have often felt like Stephanie did in this book. People always make fun of things and then they go and copy them. Maybe it is just part of growing up. I have found that people sometimes make fun of the things that they are scared of.
5,Awesome Book,This book was funny. It had soem really good pictures. I liked how Stephanie kept changing her hairstyle. It was funny to see everyone copy her. It was also cool at the end when she tricked them all into shaving their head. Stephanie is a very funny character with a lot of guts to keep changing her hair.
2,"Sort of teaches a weak lesson, I guess...","Munsch's books are usually funny, touching, or they have a clear point. This one is just sort of lame. Not only doesn't the story go anywhere, the characters use insulting language. I don't like my daughter picking that up."
3,Stephanie's Ponytail,"I like this book because the first day of school she had a ponytail from the back of her head, and everybody copied her. Then she had ponytail from the side of her head, and everybody copied her. The next day she had a ponytail from the top of her head, and everybody copied her. So she got mad and said ""tomorrow I am going to shave my head"". Then she came to school the next day with a ponytail from the back of her head again, and everybody else had their heads shaved bald. Everybody got mad at her and started chasing her down the halls."
1,Stephanie's Ponytail,This book was a very small version and this was not what I wanted. I would have wanted to know this before I purchased the book.
3,"Great story, disappointing 'mini' format","I love the Munsch books and this is a good one. So I ordered it, with 2 others, as a present for a little girl I know. I was deeply disappointed when I found that this was a ""mini"" book. Rather than being the typical size Munsch book that I have bought in the past (maybe 8"" x 6""), this was only about 3"" square. The story is good and I guess the price should have been a tip-off. When I looked the item up today, I could not find anything in the description that mentioned the size. By clicking on a link I found that there were other 'formats' but as far as I could tell, none of them mentioned a size. Possibly the older version is more normal."
5,Great lesson for all ages,"I am a pre-school teacher, and Stephanie's Ponytail is my all time favorite book. There are so many things to discuss. We talk about how feelings get hurt, sassiness, honesty, and copycatting. I have told this story to groups of up to 150 kids at a time, with all of them listening. I use it as an interactive story with them doing the ""Ugly Ugly"" chant, and I usually choose one to be Stephanie (usually a girl with a long ponytail). Robert Munsch's books are all great. Others I like are Show and Tell, Thomas' Snowsuit, MMM Cookies. They all have great lessons to teach the children in a funny way. Candice"
5,Terrific book about peer pressure and individuality,"Stephanie just wanted to go to school with a ponytail. But first the other kids make fun of her hairstyle, and then they all decide to wear their hair the same way. Each time Stephanie changes her hairstyle, she is berated (Ugly, ugly, very ugly!) and then copied. But Stephanie get even with them! She tells them she will shave her head, and sure enough... everyone shows up at school bald as a baby, except Stephanie, wearing a ponytail in the back. The last two pictures in this book are hysterically funny.My kids love this book. It gives us a nice springboard to discuss whether they like to be trendsetters or followers, and how they feel when someone copies their original ideas. This is one of Munsch's best, and he is GOOD."
4,My daughter will write a review:,I liked this book because stephanie had a ponytail and went to school and the kids said ugly ugly very ugly but the next day everybody was wearing a ponytail. I am not going to tell you any more because I want you to find out.
3,TINY,"This is a great book. As a child i always would check this book and Munsches other works out of the library. My problem is not with the writings or illustrations of the book. but the books itself. The book is about 3"" big. TINY! i was not expecting that. i guess you get what you pay for."
1,Too small,"The story is great and a favorite of mine and the children I teach, however I don't understand why amazon would send out a book that is 2"" x 2"" without listing this as the size of the book. I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to try to read that size book to any child, much less a group of children."
3,BEWARE THIS IS A MINI BOOK...Great story..wrong size book,"I purchased this book at a school book fair a few years ago. My family loves this book and it has received very positive results when read to my childrens' classes when it's my turn as parent-reader. I purchased this book for my niece who is about to receive her teaching degree. I was VERY disappointed to receive a miniature book! I do not see this mentioned in the product description anywhere. I also purchased a gift book for my daughter (different title) that too is a miniature book. I knew what I was getting, however, as the description included ""mini book"" in the title. Please correct this wrong before another customer ends up disappointed."
2,"a ""LITTLE"" disappointing","I was quite shocked when I received this book and saw how small it is, literally. It is only about three inches square. It's so small in fact that when I went to find the book to read it to review it, I can not find it. I've had it only about two days and it's already lost, so unfortunately I can not say if it is even a good book or not, but for me it doesn't matter anymore."
5,Just Robert Munch. 100% undiluted Munch,"Just get it and read it.If you don't like it, you have no soul.I also like the style of the illustrations. They convey the plot beautifully."
3,short time fun,"this toy is great for the first couple of hrs but it cannot sustain a kids imagination. After a while they get tired of ""Flicking"" the saber to life and use it just like a stick.But its still joy, esp. given the low costs."
1,Just a Saber,This Light Saber does not light up. There isn't a spot for a battery - no light bulb - nothing. It's great other than that - but a lightsaber without light is just a saber!!! I could be missing something. . .
5,An Invaluable Book for Prescribers and Users of Medications,"This often ignored problem is sensibly discussed in this excellent reference book, which was recommended to me by the senior pharmacist in a leading UK psychiatric hospital. The clear and honest approach to a difficult subject, makes an invaluable contribution to help physicians, nurses and users. I believe that every university and reference library, hospital and medical practitioner should obtain a copy. Top marks for including a CD Rom too. from the founder of 'APRIL' (Adverse Psychiatric Reactions Information Link) email address : info@april.org.uk"
2,Dragongirl,"Um...This book has a lot of potential. But it fell short.The writing style is not good. It feels like the author just threw out a few random words without even giving it thought. All of the characters were off, it's hard to discribe.I think that the author was going for the same sort of setting as Donna Napoli created with her amazing book Beast.The ideas were not very unique, and this book, unfortunantly, just seems flat and pretty much uninteresting."
2,nothing to look forward to,"I absolutely loved the first book and was dying for Wolf Tower, the sequel. Well it was definitely a disappointment. I felt like it was dragged out and fairly boring. Claidi's adventures were pretty uneventful although i'm still looking forward to Wolf Queen, the 3rd book because the ending of the 2nd one is such a CLIFF HANGER!! i dont know why everybody else loved Wolf Tower so much although i guess some parts are pretty interesting and i like the way tanith lee writes! and my sister totally agrees."
3,Wolf Tower,"This book has a fascinating plot, unique set of characters, and an idea behind it that is riveting and attractive to me. However, after I finished the book I was turned off from the rest of the series by the fact that Claidi often uses swear words in her entries that she picked up from her crush, Nemian. I sincerely wish that Ms. Lee had not spoiled this wonderful fantasy with a smatter of profanity. Please use good judgement before you decide to read this book."
1,Ridiculous story and boring,"Neither my 14-year-old daughter nor I could finish this book. I did read the last few chapters to find out what happened, but I don't think that counts. The character of Claidi is difficult to sympathize with -- she makes many stupid decisions and does not appear to learn from her mistakes. My daughter declared that Claidi is an immature twit. We picked up this book thinking it might be on par with Tamora Pierce's books, however, this is a very, very pale imitation. Don't bother buying the book if you are curious, just borrow it from someone or the library."
5,just great,i loved claidi she is a really cool person.i say person because the author made her so life like.The way the author expained every thing it made so real.I could go on and on but i will stop here saying...READ THIS BOOK ITS GREAT!
5,Wonderful!,"This book has been one of the best ive read. Many good parts where theres suspence and romance and laughter. I reccommend this book for all. I applaude Ms. Lee, excellant book!"
5,You'll Love it,Do you like fantasy books? If you do this is the book for you. Tanith Lee has woven a truely beatiful story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I'm sure you will enjoy it.
2,"I want to like it, but...","I really wanted to like this book. It started out great, with a unique setting, a heroine who was both funny and brave, and an interesting cast of supporting characters. But then it started to falter. Although the main character retained her charm, the plot turned into a confusing mess. Characters dropped teasing hints that never seemed to go anywhere; the heroine's travelling partner has a personality that changes at the drop of a hat. It even gets difficult to understand what's going on. I've tried to read this book several times, but it just doesn't make much sense at all. What a shame. I was really excited for this one."
1,"there's so much better fantasy out there, I wish I had spent my time reading them","Claidi is a maid to a mean princess in a prison-like castle surrounded by the Wastes. Her life changes when the lion-haired Nemain crashes his balloon into the castle. Told she is a princess, she rescues the prince and heads for adventures among the peoples of the Waste with Nemain. Smitten with Nemain (who doesn't treat her well), Claidi follows him blindly to his home, rejecting the love of a ""thief"" she meets in the Waste. Tanith Lee's writing style is convoluted and distracting. The story is boring and predictable, an endless and tedious journey with the ending clearly spelled out; the characters are flat and banal and hardly empathetic. Wish I had spent the time reading Gail Carson Levine, Neil Gaiman, Diana Wynne Jones, or Douglass Adams. Grade: D-"
3,wolf Tower,"Wolf Tower is a really fun book to read. I although some of the situations Claidi goes through are unrealistic and way too predictable. I would reccomend this book over Wolf Star and Wolf Queend, which were very disappointing."
4,An entertaining read,"I really enjoyed 'Wolf Tower,' so much so that I immediately went in search of the two sequels. On its own, this book is good. It's entertaining and fairly easy to read. The only real complaint I had was that some of the language Claidi uses seems a bit too modern (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5). Claidi is an engaging heroine with a mind of her own, and this narrative of her travels in a strange world is highly enjoyable.This book can (and should) stand on its own. I was extremely disappointed with the next two books in the series. So I would definitely recommend 'Wolf Tower'... just stay clear of 'Wolf Star' and 'Wolf Queen' if you don't want to be left with a bad taste in your mouth."
2,Not the best country music dvd,"I was disappointed with this dvd.To me it was too much Jerry Lee Lewis and not enough of the other singers.(I am not knocking Jerry Lee,I enjoy his country hits)."
3,Some great tracks.,"Some of the songs on this disc are absolutely fabulous, others are not quite as good. The first three (Leaving Trunk, She Caught the Katy and Fishing Blues) are huge. So's Chevrolet. Cakewalk is pretty good too. The others, however, are not what I look for when buying a blues album. In my mind this album's a mixed bag, as far as blues go. But the 4 or 5 standout tracks are definitely worth owning."
4,Delta blues sung by one of the greats,"I discovered Taj Mahal in 1969 via The Natch'l Blues and have been enthralled ever since. Taj has a voice that resonates with velvet, honey and pain. The songs are a fairly good selection from his first five or six albums.Most are not originals, but old blues standards. One has a reggae flair, which fits in nicely, not jarring, as you might imagine. Leaving Trunk has been covered by most blues revival groups and is a fitting entry into this wonderful selection of very accessible Delta Blues.One small quibble: Gorgeous songs such as The Cuckoo and Corinna should have been included... but then, I'm sure, this would have ended being a double CD."
4,Educational Read,A good introduction to the perils of addiction and the biological and chemical processes that grip users. An important message to anyone touched by the horrors of addiction.
5,"Full of Hope, Sensible Concepts, and Helpful Tools","Reading this book made me feel stronger as I am facing a loved one's chemical and emotional problems. There are many important concepts in the book to help people with the pain, sadness, and frustration that go along with having addicted family or friends. It is well written and well researched. The author is fair and compassionate to people who are addicts and to their families. I will keep this book handy throughout my journey and will share it with others who might benefit from it."
5,Addict In The Family,"Trying to sort through all the resources about addicts, addiction, and being the loved one of an addict is overwhelming and time consuming. This book hits the nail on the head! Fact based and very grounded advise for family and friends bound by love to an addict."
3,Informative,Very informative the persprective of some of the addicts was very moving I bought this book for my kindle and a hard copy for my mother.
5,Must read for anyone affected by a loved one's addiction,"This is an excellent resource for anyone affected by a loved one's addiction. Immediately after I finished reading it, I ordered copies for my entire family."
3,[...],not what i expected. i thought i ordered the very cherry jelly bellies. i will never buy these again.
2,"Ok design, but comfort is hit or miss","Like many others going through a ""pillow crisis"", I've tried many pillows in many shapes and sizes and I know it is a maddening process. I purchased this based on the level of customization it provides, and on that level it does succeed - however I just couldn't get comfortable on it. It is well-made and easy to use but comfort is so subjective with pillow shopping and the no-return policy is what gives this a lower rating. My suggestion is to try to find pillows that are returnable, but if you are desperate like I was, then all you can do is buy it and hope for the best. That is a tough way to shop, so read the reviews and take your time."
5,EXCELLENT! Long lasting !,"I got 2 of these for my daughter to use after her knee replacement surgery. I also bought another brand, but THESE are the best! Long lasting compared to most gel pacs. a little heavier than most, but that is why they last longer I assume."
4,Region 1 DVD Available?,"I've listened to the 2CD Version Intégrale of Roméo & Juliette, and I like it very much....it only makes me wish that there would be a Region 1 DVD available. ""Roméo & Juliette"" is available on DVD but only in Region 2 format (for Europe & Japan).....either they make a version for the North American market, or I'll have to fork over money for a DVD player that plays all regions."
5,nice cd for musical lovers,"being a fan of ""notre dame de paris"", I was really excited when ""romeo and juliette"" came out. Sure the words are the cheesy kind but the music is great :)of course one has to understand french for the lyrics to make sense since they include no subtitles and for the other reviewer who complained about no subtitles and yadada, he should know that many other english plays have no subtitles when selling in foreign countries too.Some great parts are aimer, on dit dans la rue, coupable and les rois du monde. It's a must for any french plays lovers and if you understand what they're saying, it gets even better!"
4,I love french musicals,"I have to admit, I was very excited when my french teacher announced we'd be watching another french musical: romeo et juliette. However, I was a bit wary because I didn't think anything could measure up to Notre Dame de Paris, the first french musical I'd ever watched. I have to say, I still love Notre Dame de Paris more than Romeo et Juliette, but Romeo et Juliette takes a very close second. Damien Sargue is extremely good-looking, with his chiseled looks, and has a wonderful voice. The girl who plays Juliette is also very talented. I think the music is more enjoyable and even more beautiful after you have seen the musical. You can imagine the actors' faces and expressions while they're singing each song and it draws you in even more. Enjoy!"
2,Very much like the last DVD.,"I'm a huge fan of Abraham and the Hick's but I'm starting to feel very ripped off. I am a bit obsessed by all the teaching of Abraham but as for the DVDs they are all the same. Most of the people in this DVD, i'd seen in previous DVDs I have bought. I think there was only about 3 people asking questions that I didn't recognize from another DVD. If this is the only one you buy it's good but if like me you watch and buy quite a few then you might want to rethink this purchase.It's a shame but I am going to stay away from them from now on and just read the books because there is no point and I don't want to feel like they are just out to get more money."
3,hmm,"There is nothing in this DVD that ""Abraham"" has not already addressed in previous DVD's's and books. Whether or not you are skeptical about Jerry and Esther (and admittedly, I am) I believe this DVD and their others contain beneficial information that can truly help people. If you do want or need to lose weight it can't hurt to hear these concepts repeated to an audience who shares your specific desires. There is something however that intrigues me about this particular DVD - at 4:22 into part 2 ""Abraham"" states ""spend more time noticing what is"" yet at 21:58 ""Abraham states ""nevermind what is"". Is it me or is that a contradiction and if so what does that say about Jerry, Esther and ""Abraham"" if anything."
2,Has anyone actually lost any weight?,"I was thinking about buying this, but after reading the reviews I noticed that not one person had mentioned that they were losing any weight... so I'm guessing that while this may be an interesting concept it's really difficult to apply it and see actual results. I'd be curious to hear from those who lost 10lbs or more because of the info in the dvds."
5,Privileged to learn from Dr. Moon,"During my seminary days, I had the privilege of learning from Dr. Moon, this book was one of the textbooks available for our class.By identifying with the Korean people through the understanding of Han, I began to more deeply understand both the Old Testament and the New Testament. It is easy from an Americanized standpoint to look at Scripture strictly as the gospel for the wealthy. Only by removing our blinders and seeking understanding of the Scriptures within other cultures can we return to the past and see them as appropriate for the poor.I am grateful for Dr. Moon's dedication and scholarly studies which deeply enriched my faith and my concern for those who are not a part of elite rulers. It was my study of Minjung theology that drives some of my concerns for the poor and downtrodden today.While no textbook could contain all of the knowledge and wisdom of this dedicated professor, this one is an excellent study."
3,plastic plunger doesn't hold up,"I like the aerolatte, especially since I like my coffee strong. Unfortunately the plunger broke after about a year."
3,not too impressed,"I bought this to use at the office, for those times when I'm too lazy or feeling too poor to go downstairs to buy my coffee. After having used this for about a week, I've found that I often have to have a paper towel on hand to clean the grounds off the rim of the cup after pulling the plunger out, plus grounds inevitably sneak their way into the coffee. Maybe my plunging technique is less honed than the other two reviewers, but I can't seem to make grounds-free coffee with this sucker."
5,"Very impressed, works Great!","I've used a Starbucks version of the Bodum Travel press and it worked well for over two years until I microwaved it to death (the inner wall started to deform ); after purchasing a second Bodum Travel press, it was not quite as good as the first (the plunger was shorter plus the screen kept unscrewing). After I inadvertently dropped the thing and cracked it (three feet, onto carpet), I decided to hunt for something different and came across this Coffee Press from Aerolatte. Its twice the cost but 10 times better!It offers exceptional quality and a smooth trouble free plunger mechanism plus it works just as they advertise. The only disappointing thing is that you can not microwave it (for obvious reasons) but I do have access to hot water so that's not a big deal.Again, highly recommended."
1,No Way! Sent it Back!,"I own a typical glass french press, which works great. I was willing to try this one because of the traveling capability. I would not purchase this again, and actually sent two back. It may have had great insulation to keep coffee warm, but it leaked grounds into the coffee! Yuck!"
4,Fresh Fruity Plump & Seductive,"A lush rich seductive scent. Strong notes of plump fruit with undertones of musk. If the perfume had a body type, I'd say it would be voluptuous!My only qualm is that Fresh scents seem to dissapate rapidly (within about 4 hours). Best applied an hour or so before you need it!"
4,a personal favorite,This is the second time I have purchased this scent and still love it. I love the fresh line because it is one of the few products I can wear on my skin without an allergic reaction. The scent never fails to generate compliments. KMRN
5,GREAT HAIRSPRAY!,"This hairspray is great for me because I have very black hair, and sometimes it just looks dull. If I use another name brand hairspray, it just makes my hair look even more duller and lifeless. This Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine spray is great for me because it does everything that it says. It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking, and keeps my style all day long. Will never be without it!!"
1,disappointing,"I have to agree with the reviewers who said this product was not a strong hold spray. It does nothing for me at all. It does not hold as well as my medium hold spray. I don't know how it can be called a Freeze Super Spray, for it is definitely not. It was a complete waste of money and I would not recommend it to a friend or buy it again. I have short, fine hair that I curl with a curling iron and this was worthless to hold it after just a few minutes and I sprayed it from a distance so just a fine mist fell over my hair as per my hairdresser's instructions so it would not flatten my hair. There don't seem to be any good products out there for my purposes these days so I guess I'll just save my money. The only positive thing about this product is that it did not have a strong, offensive odor and could be used by someone with fragrance sensitivity, which I have, if it worked. I also didn't notice that it imparted any shine."
1,piece of crap,This is a piece of crap. Menus do not function properly and playback is sporadic. Very poor quality and obviously an inferior dub from an old VHS. This has nothing to do with the content. This is virtually unwatchable. I want a refund. I think Ray would be pissed if he knew they were selling junk like this with his name on it.
4,Incredible!,Many people probly are missing out on reading this book- and they definetely need to read this! its a very sad tale of a young palestinian girl who longs for her father's return- he went to look for a job in israel. When turmoil breaks out- malaak is able to stay strong- this is her incredible story. I recommend this 100%
5,An Insightful Gem,"At a time when so much violence permeates the Middle East, this ""insightful gem"" is a must read. The perspective presented here is seldom heard. The reader will gain an understanding of the fear, humiliation, and despair that is endured by so many people in this region. Oh, how I wish that many of our leaders would read this book!"
2,"Nicely written, but a little fuzzy on the ethics","Nicely, with grace and intelligence, and, clearly, with good intentions.Still, it would've been nice to see more stress on the idea that random violence is bad because it is bad---not just because it will bring down even more bad on you, or your family.This latter view--that bombing or throwing stones at Israeli civilians is a bad tactic because Israeli authorities will retaliate---that's what passes for a moderate view among Palestinians. And that's a big part of the problem."
1,Major disapointment,"This ""novel"" is thinly veiled propaganda, pure and simple. It is a shame that this type of ""literature"" is aimed at such a young and impressionable audience. This book was part of my child's public school cirriculum, and while it does attempt to illustrate that violence is no solution to the Middle East conflict, it is quite obvious where the author's sensitivities lie. This was a major disappointment, I would not feel comfortable recommending this book to others."
1,Disappointed,"Yes, I know, I know. It's only a work of fiction. The author has every right to her expressions, her imagination, her story.I feel cheated. Propaganda disguised as a novel. Candlewick... how could you?What next? Hitler as a hero?"
1,What an outdated and overblown book,"This book was published in 1998, the dot com boom years. At that time anybody will an IQ above 90 can get a high paying programming job. So many advices given in this book are totally wrong today. Come on, $155 per hour for a Visual Basic contractor? It's almost impossible to land on a good pay contract job today without many years of experience on a very special field, especially with all the H-1B workers flooding the market. Believe me, I have 11 years of experience and interviewed with many contract job recruiters. Don't bother with agencies, they are GREEDY and will take 30% or more of your pay. After many fruitless tries, I opted for a full time $130K job with stock options, best part, I can work anywhere in the world and telecommute. For good programmers, good startups are better than contract jobs."
4,Great book for self study lovers,The author displays a drill instructor manner at times. I still was not insulted by this book. The guide shows how to maximize learning quickly while retaining knowledge. I have a Masters degree and still managed to gain valuable study tips. The book has accelerated my Java self-study significantly.
5,little known gem,"This album was recorded in the late 80s by Japanese musician Hiroyuki Usui and had a limited release in the early 90s. The album is broadly in the genre of experimental/acid folk, having similarities with artists like Loren Conners, Six Organs of Admittance and Spires That In The Sunset Rise. Usui uses a wide range of instrumentation (guitars, vibes, digeridoo, drums, strings) and scattered vocals/spoken word to create an ambient feel. Most songs lack a clear groove or traditional song structure but substitute rhythmic drive with acoustic complexity. For those looking to branch out, this is really a great disc and a worthwhile foray into experimental folk music."
3,Glad to see a box set but disappointed about the selection,"I'm glad to see that Jean has gotten a boxed set but there are so many of her films not available on DVD, and these were all already available. What about Red Dust? Three Wise Girls? Bombshell? I'd love to see another box where some of the films not available on DVD are featured."
2,I am not feeling this one at all. . .,"I just don't know about this record. No song besides Missing You jumps out at me at all. I'm all about listening to some great soul r&b romantic type of music, but I think Case just went too romantic on it, which I didn't think was possible. In my opinion he just went too soft, just doesn't have one particularly powerful song on the entire album at all."
4,BEST BREAKOUT R&B THIS YEAR!!!!!!,"I just wanna say that case is the best new r&b artist ive heard all year. Songs that are epecially good are driving, shine and not your friend. everyone should go out and buy this cd!!!!!!! its da bomb"
4,Push Play And Relax,"This album is great throughout, so you can press play and just chillout to the fantastic songs that are being played. I have a few favourites on this album which are, Missing You (worth buying the album for), Shine, Not Your Friend, Sex Games and No Regrets, although its had to pick from an album that seems to be rated so highly by so many people."
4,Very good CD!!!,"I don't know why people diss case on this album open letter. Because I think it is a very good album. Some of my favourite songs are : Conversate, no regrets and of course missing you. It is a album that relax you.So Case, go on making good albums."
3,Bad grammar in a grammar text. Buyer beware,"Dr. Elliott writes on page 24, ""Here are the six tenses you have to choose from.Past perfect tense: I had eaten pizza just before you arrived"", which is incorrect.On page 25 she writes: ""Be consistent with tenses. 'I got home late and Mom fussed at me for not calling to let her know where I had been.' I got home = past tense. Mom fussed = past tense. Where I had been = past perfect tense."" She should have taken her own advice. 'Where I was' is correct, not 'Where I had been'. She does not define or explain the past perfect (which is certainly a fault in a grammar text) and she demonstrates, as illustrated, that she does not understand the past perfect. If you care about this important tense, disregard pages 24 and 25, as regards the past perfect, and wherever else the past perfect appears."
5,Great,Don't be fooled by the cute and childish cover. This book is very helpful for adults as well as students in grasping grammar rules that are often not taught in school. A must read! Very pleased to have purchased it.
4,"Grammar, I'm starting to get it.","As a homeschooling mother, who never 'got' grammar, this book has helped immensely. Grammar does make sense, and isn't as boring as school made it seem to be."
4,Good,"Great book. I was using it when I was preparing for IELTS. Content is well arranged, and it is not boring at all! I always hated grammar in school, but this was really painless. Rules are independent from each other, so that this book can be used as encyclopedia of grammar. Nevertheless the active table of contents is to simple, so finding anything in this book is arduous."
5,"""Painless Grammar"" is Really Painless","Having graduated from high school many years ago, my last grammar course was a bit out of date. The purpose for my purchasing this book was to obtain a quick reference for current rules of grammar to help convince my friend why I suggest certain changes in his book before his manuscript is submitted. I was a bit disappointed when I realized the target audience for this book was kids. However, as I read it, I was delighted. Adults who were staunch grammar students from decades ago (like myself) can refresh their knowledge as well as learn a few things in the process - all in an easy-to-understand format. This is a great reference book!"
5,Painless grammer is a quick reference guide,I purchased this book because a friend of mine lent me her book for a while. I found it a great tool in and out of the classroom and recommend it to any middle school or high school student or to any teacher to use as a reference tool for her classroom.
2,Too curly.,"Could not keep from rolling my hair too tight when using these soft rollers. They do ""sleep"" better than the metal; however, the curl was too tight & had to redo on hard curlers."
1,These should be labeled small,I have seen medium foam rollers by a different manufactuer that are larger than these. I am not happy with this purchase.
5,<3,"my daughter loves nesting dolls as do i. so we each got one, so we can have a project to do together. good quality."
5,Unpainted nesting dolls,The unpainted dolls were exactly as shown. They came with a wonderful flyer about the history of the dolls. It was a nice plus. They arrived in a very timely manner.
1,save up for something useful,"Unless your ground is marshmallowy or you were hoping for to strain your shoulders, this isn't for you."
2,Makes great BIG holes!!!,"""My neighbor asked me if I had a gopher problem...I told him no...they were made by a GARDEN WEASEL!!"" This thing's great...but it makes big holes in the lawn that need to be back filled after you twist the weeds out. And depending on how much you use it...the claws may bend out of shape like they did on me. Make sure the area you work on is very moist for easy use. I did mine in the rain...."
4,Handy tool for its purpose,"This is a handy tool for cultivating small areas, but it is not appropriate for anything more than a medium sized flowerbed. The handles work well to gain leverage, but you will feel it in your muscles if you attempt to do too large an area!The fact that it isn't powered lets you get into areas you wouldn't want to go with even the smallest of tillers, and it does a great job of breaking up the ground to a depth of a couple of inches, which is perfect for flowers.For larger projects, use a mini-tiller, and use this tool for the detail work and the smaller beds. Both tools are a good combination to have at your disposal."
3,Good for soft soils,"I too, bought this for use in hard clayey soil, only to be disappointed. If you try to till more than 2"" deep of hard soil you will have difficulty. Once I learned a technique to using it I was able to go faster, but this is still slow, it only does an area of about 0.25 square foot a time. A 400 sq ft garden 6"" deep would take about 4800 back straining tries. I would not buy one again. Since I have this, I will make use of it yearly to till the softer dirt in my established gardens and flower beds.I am big and strong, and to insert it into the ground I had to first jump up and down on it. Once it was in the ground I tried to turn the handle to no avail, and I think I actually bent it slightly. As I said, till only a couple inches of hard soil at a time to avoid difficulty.If you have a large hard area you need to till, use the money to rent a power cultivator instead or just use a shovel. It will be much faster and easier."
5,small garden,the weasel worked out great for me as I have a small raised bed garden. I had a choice of getting the weasel or a small tiller. I made the best choice. The weasel is easy to use and i get the exersize that I needed also. Its a great cultivator.
4,Garden Weasel,It's a good tool. Very effective in areas where there isn't much spacing between plants. Works good with loam and sandy soil. Works in clay but it takes substantially more effort.
5,couldn't garden without it,"I had a yard full with garden areas that had about Five years of weeds to clean out. With the Garden Claw, I was able to clean up those areas in no time. It made work that would have been impossiable to do, very simple. I couldn't have done it without the Garden Claw."
4,nice comfortable pillow,"I paid $70 for this pillow at my chiropractic office. Once the inflation level is adjusted, it's the best type pillow I've used (and I've tried many different types).I would have given it a five star rating, but one of the air chambers leaks and has to be re-inflated every night....it's flat by morning. I have not contacted the manufacturer-distributor to see if they will fix it or replace it. Stay tuned!"
5,"Cooke Quartet, bringing it back","The Cooke Quartet is a bringing back the old school flavor missing from todays Jazz scene. Michael Cooke is an amazing sax player, who has put together an equally amazing group. This CD will blow your mind, a must for all Jazz lovers!"
4,ageless,"As a older female adult, I found this CD very enjoyable. I think any age lover of jazz will find something to truly relate to."
5,Great Work!,"This is a masterful work of novelization. This story was supposed to be the last appearance of the Daleks on Doctor Who, because the creator of the Daleks, Terry Nation, wanted to start a series with them in America. The series didn't pan out, so the Docter's arch-enemies returned to where they became famous. This is also the story that Patrick Troughton ( the second Doctor)said he would return to play in a movie. John Peel used is great resources as a fan and historian of the program to get the most out of the retelling of this seven episode story of which only one episode survives. The story travels from London of 1960s to the English Coast of the 1860s to the Daleks home planet of Skaro to reach the final destruction of the Docter's greatest foes. It would not be the last Docter would see of the Daleks however, being a time traveler would meet the wicked creatures several times in wanderings through time and space."
4,Don't believe everything you read.,"I wonder if the previous reviewer even read the book. Her assertion that an emotionally abusive husband ""can change"" would seem to suggest that she has not. This is from p.45 of this book:""Abused women often cling to the notion that he'll change. After an episode, they talk. He says he's sorry and she's sure he'll change because he sees how hurt she is. Then there is another episode and more false hopes, until after a while there are no apologies, just silence. Still, she keeps hoping he'll change... It would be so much easier if only he'd stop his abuse and she wouldn't have to make all the changes. It doesn't work that way.""I read this book because a close friend of mine is in an emotionally abusive relationship and I am having a hell of a time trying to understand why she won't leave. Well, she's told me a dozen times: she thinks that he will change, and she's gonna help him do it.I'm not holding my breath."
2,"sexploitation, the early days","Although these are all low budget, with cardboard sets, flat lighting, and bad sound, they are fun to watch in a retro kinda way. More interesting is that Hand and Orgy are both produced by the same company, and feature the same plot twist, involving men being drained of energy through oral sex. Reminded of the mad general in Strangelove, warning of ""losing our precious bodily fluids."" Somebody behind both these films obviously shared this terror. I see the other reviewer here claims the soundtracks on these two are redone, but I can't imagine a different soundtrack would improve these. I like the clumsiness, and somewhat inept filming, being a fan of early sex films (for one thing, no silicone), but these are not for everyone."
5,Evidence,"This game is awesome. It's sort of freaky and very challenging. It definitely makes you think a lot, so it takes a lot of concentration and failed attempts. It gets a little repetitive after playing it for a long time. But overall, its definitely worth trying it."
1,Need internet search skills,"Very difficult to understand. Need expertise with internet searches. Money better spent on more user friendly games. I'm not an amateur at these game's, but found this one difficult, and confusing."
1,Cheapy,I ordered this from Furniture on the Web (never buy from them again) and it felt very cheap definitely not worth $100. Plus I had to pay for shipping both ways so after I returned I ended up paying about $130 for it! Total rip off. It wouldn't stand up in a garden and it is too big to keep inside (unless your ozzy osborn) and FOW were jerks through the whole process! Look somewhere else if you want a nice gargoyle statue for your home or to give as a gift.
5,Priceless!,"This cd was a gift from a friend... probably the greatest gift I have ever received (other than those from God). It is one of those cd's you can put in and listen to every song, over and over and over... It fans the flame! Get it... I promise you will love it!"
5,"beautiful, fun, entertaining","I don't buy a lot of movies, but I had to buy this one! Happy Holidays is one of those classic films I would watch again and again. It's got a dry sense of humor that reminds me of a good Woody Allen film, but its more uplifting than Allen. Sort of a coming-of-age film for us middle agers. It's intelligent, it's funny, and it's cathartic. Oh yeah, and the beautiful outdoor cinematography is a treat all by itself!"
3,"Decent, but Boring","This book was required for my Civil Engineering senior design class. The book went into a lot of detail and explained a lot about the entire process of land development, but it was also boring. We hated it because we were all Structural and Construction student, not land development. I think an engineer in land development might like this book."
4,Claudia Perez,"the book was excelent! i loved how she told about her affair with Al and Henrique (oh baby). it was so romantic. i was jealous. i'm serious! then how she told about her friend 'Liz'. who was actually a spirit...not a real. living person. to tell you the truth i was a bit freaked out by it. but then when she said about that night in Mexico...her birthday and she drank tequilla. i mean i thought that was the COOLEST. go Clau! this book was GREAT! i mean i have read it about 16 times. yes...i am obsessed. you should buy it! teach it to people. read it on the street! now Nitz is here. sorry...ok so what's up?I'm just not going to tell you then end ok! thanks, and bye."
4,A great first novel...,I thought the book was enjoyable to read. I give it one of the biggest compliments I think an author can receive and that is the fact that once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. The author keeps your interest throughout the entire story. It is a great book to curl up on the couch on a Sunday and read while it's raining/snowing outside! I think the author did a good job for a first novel and I hope there is more to follow.
2,What does it mean?,This is one of the most confusing bunch of words thrown together that I've ever seen. I don't even know what happened to the disjointed characters that enter and sometimes exit or just don't get mentioned again.It's really kind of stupid. The writer sounds like a confused little boy with odd imagery in his head although I did laugh really hard at some parts in the book (don't think they were intended to be funny).If it wasn't for the funny parts I would have given it 1 star.
3,"Good plot, but not very good dialogue","The plot of this book was excellent, but the dialogue was sorely lacking. Also the character developement of some characters was weak and lacking focus. It jumps from story line to story line with no connection develeoped between them, or very weak connections. Some of it just seemed to be thrown in at the last moment to tie things together. I did like the idea behind the book though, very original, and very well thought out. As a first book I rate it as a good one, and I think that this author has a lot going for him, I look forward to more from him."
2,Lacking and Misleading Title,"Bought this DVD for my Mahalia Jackson collection. And much to my dismay, there were only 2 very brief segments devoted to the Greatest MJ (not the KOP). To add insult to injury, both segments showed the identical performance; NOT the performance on the cover at all. Very misleading cover. Other gospel artists were great but I purchased this b/c of Mahalia. Beware."
4,Solid,"Actually, I have an original pressing of this album on vinyl and track 5 IS listed as ""Heartbreak Hotel"". It was also listed in the top-40 charts by that name according to the book I have.It was changed for this re-release on CD for reasons that escape me. On the whole ""Triumph"", which came out between ""Off The Wall"" and ""Thriller"" is a very solid effort by the Jacksons (with Michael having a large part in the creation) and fits right in with the style of those other albums."
5,i must say i love the jacksons & all 9 songs are great,i love this cd and the jacksons.they are my favorite grou
5,Just A Quick Note...,"This review may never see the light of day and be deleted within minutes but I have to say it, just one more time.....The song is titled ""This Place Hotel"" not ""Heartbreak Hotel""!! Please read the LP label and listen to the lyrics, Michael sings on the chorus..'this place is...'so can the music journalists and fans reviewing this brilliant LP please get it right? Just a quibble I know, but it's also annoying, I mean, no one calls ""Rainy Day Women #12 & #35"" ""They'll Stone You"" do they?"
5,My heart danced to 'Triumph' and my feet followed.,"This is one of my 'all-time' favorite Jacksons projects.Being an ex-Michael Jackson impersonator,...this one stayed on my turntable (remember those), as I rehearsed for hours nightly.Simply put, this CD is funky!It was released during an era when it was all about 'the dance'.From the classic message filled groove of 'Can You Feel It' to the haunting storytelling vibe of 'Heartbreak Hotel'. This one moves you.Other tracks that will definitely give U ""happy feet"" are 'Lovely One','Your Ways '( a song in which Michael delivers a superb falsetto vocal range ), and 'Walk Right Now'.Also noteworthy is the melodic and somewhat sad ballad 'Time Waits For No One'.Whether U you are dance music fan or just introducing your children to some good old-school rhythms,..U won't be disappointed with 'Triumph'.:-)PeaceS h a d o w"
1,"Really just ""As a Man Thinketh"" with different pronouns","I have to admit, I was disappointed in this book. I had read, ""As a Man Thinketh"" and loved that book. It is a classic on the power of thought. So when I saw there was an, ""As a Woman Thinketh,"" I thought it would be interesting to see what it said. This book literally just takes ""As a Man Thinketh"" and replaces all the masculine gender references with feminine gender references. So ""he"" becomes ""she"" and ""him"" becomes ""her"", etc.I would recommend reading the original book, ""As a Man Thinketh"" by James Allen."
3,Probably not worth the price.,"Was a nice documentary on escorts. However after viewing the DVD, it didn't seem to have the quality of a Michael Moore documentary or something you would see on HBO or A&E.;The ladies interviewed had very interesting personalities, and the material was intriguing, but the presentation was very amateurish. This movie, in my opinion, is probably not worth the $24.95 asking price. Belongs in the bargain bin."
2,Packaging is terrible!,"As others have reported, this is a wonderful collection that is amazingly under-packaged. My husband removed the binder from the slipcase and a dozen DVDs fell to the floor. Whoever designed this should go back to school because he/she is a rank amateur!"
4,"Great Set, Bad Packaging","Most of the films in this set are classics, with the main exceptions being Birdcage, Hotel Rwanda and Bowling for Columbine. Only a few of the films in the set are constantly cited as top notch; Annie Hall, Raging Bull, 12 Angry Men and Some Like It Hot. However if you look at AFIs list of 400 nominated films you will see most of the films included in the set are on the nomination list. Judgement and Nuremberg, Marty, The Manchurian Candidate, The Birdman of Alcatraz and Fiddler on the Roof are all excellent films.The main problem is the packaging. The discs are put into slots on each page describing the film. However the discs easily slide out of these slots and can get damaged. If you do purchase this set I recommend you cheap disc cases.At the end of the day the the low price of this set make it more than worth while. 30 films for a little over 100 bucks, AMAZING"
5,Not enough stars to rate this book!!!,FANTASTIC!!! It was amazing!!!Everything that you want too know is in this book!!!I LOVE Pharlap and anything too do with him!!! So read Phar Lap as soon as you can it ROCKS!!!
1,Big disappointment,"I fell for the sales pitch on this one. To quote the product description: ""Beautifully presented with archival photographs, newspaper articles, and racing memorabilia, this book commemorates one of the best racehorses of all time."" That sentence is what made me choose to order the book. There are two small photos, one of Phar Lap and Tommy Woodcock on the title page and a small photo on page 165. Okay, 2 pictures qualifies it for plural on ""photos"" but only technically. I don't know what qualifies as ""racing memorabilia"" but there were racing statistics and a chapter rambling on about pedigrees, pricing colts, etc. I get a lot of good books, some at great deals, through Amazon. This is not one of them. If it wouldn't cost more than the book is worth to me to send it back I would return it."
3,Read it,What really happed to the racehorse Phar Lap? Why did they call him a freak. I want read the story and find out.
1,Can they drag it out any more!,"The Remnant was extremely disappointing. It was almost as if different authors wrote this book. It took over 200 pages to move through one story line that didn't really move the story. And where was the God part in the first 200 pages. I love the series because it makes me think. I was so looking forward to the next book and now I am extremely disappointed in how slow the book reads. We now have all these characters but nothing is happening to them. I hope the authors take more time on the next book, it showed that this one was rushed through."
2,Degrading into soap opera...,"I've been disappointed in the TV show ER, in how they have abandoned the great medical action and descended into a soap opera of character combinations. That mirrors the feeling I have toward The Remnant. I feel that the tribulation action has been replaced by the petty interactions between the main characters. The whole thrill of the books is the way they bring to life the Biblical prophecies of the book of Revelation. This one didn't do that very well for me.It was very disjointed, especially in the scenes with the angels appearing. It was hard for me to sense continuity in this book. It could be that this book will prove to be a foundational book for action in the ones to come, but I have to admit that I had to force-read this."
2,The Big Let Down in the Series Begins....,"I guess it had to happen. Books Six, Seven, Eight and Nine were absolutely excellent. Halfway through this book, I was getting excited about what was promising to be a strong end to the series. But as I noted, halfway through this book, everything hit the brick wall with a loud, resounding splat. The first half of this book continues an excellent storyline, and continues working phenomenal character growth. But for some odd reason, this book quickly degenerates into a Bible tract. Much like Books Four and Five, the second half of this book destroys the excellent promise and progress of Six through Nine. I have hopes that things will turn around in the last two books of the series, but somehow I see the preachy Bible tract aspect continue through to the end. What a shame if it does...this series had so much potential to be more than just a scare tactic towards witnessing."
3,Loses a little luster,"This novel picks up where the last left off. I still love the series and will keep reading the next installments. I also recommend reading Steve Alten's latest thriller, RESURRECTION, part of his DOMAIN series. RESURRECTION kept me turning pages like the first books in the Left Behind series did!"
2,Not very good.. God forgive me..,I'm sorry but this was poorly written. I've enjoyed the series up to this point but this is not very good. I love LaHaye but he should have read the book and at least spiced it up.
1,I've had enough,"After immensely enjoying the first few books in the series, I have started to find that the last few just plod along. I find myself just turning the pages without absorbing what's going on. It seems as if they are trying to stretch out the series as much as they can. I've decided to stop reading these books."
4,Novel Value Not Theology.,"This was an exciting book! The solution to the ""clift-hanger"" from the last book was excellent. The novel races (getting faster) towards the climatic conclusion. Putting a book down because someone disagres with the theology is not a good review. People have been ""proving"" theology one way or the other from the Bible for years. Cultists do it daily. Quoting the Scriptures for support One way or the other does NOT make a bad book. Disagreing with the theology in this book does not make it bad. Reading this Might convience people to Read the Book this is based on. Is that Bad???"
2,Another Left Behind book where nothing happens!,"Just read the last few pages if you want to see what will happen! I can't believe how boring this book was. It was torture to read. I really loved the first few books in the series. The idea was compelling and the writing was pretty good. Now, I believe the authors think they have become such a commercial success that they feel obliged to turn out a book every few months. The books are very short; huge margins are found on every page yet it is beginning to take forever to get through each one. And, like I previously stated, NOT ONE THING HAPPENS! I know one thing, I won't be buying any more of these books; I have wasted my time. Now, on to Jane Austen where everything is wonderfully written and you can't wait to see what happens next (even if you've read it ten times before!)."
1,Speed It Up!,"I have enjoyed this series from the beginning, but the authors are getting ridiculous. It's like Jenkins and LaHaye want to milk their cash cow for all it's worth and don't want it to end. The book should have been titled ""The Rescue of Sebastian"" because it seems that's all they covered. I'm done waiting for these books, and done reading this series."
3,Hopelessly hooked on this soap opera series-thanks Elaine!,"More and more I'm thinking that I will never get to read of the Glorious Appearing. Also, I'm beginning to detest some of the main characters. Is it me, or is Chloe becoming ditzier with age. I'm glad Buck had the fortitude to stick with Chaim, because I would have given up on him much, much sooner! For such a shallow, miserable person such as Hattie was, she sure got to go out with a big bang! Lastly, typical of todays entertainment culture; little or no love,tenderness (sex), too much gratuitous violence."
2,The worst book of the series,"This volume shows extreme unbalance with the first half totally concentrates on the escape from Greece/the deliverance of Petra from the missles. The second half is very boring with many episodes copied straight out of the Bible, e.g. the openning of the earth to swallow the rebels. This is the only book in the series that I had to force myself many times to finish reading. Also, I hope there will no more airport-escaping scenes in the next books. Maybe my expectation is too high, but I really think that the authors have not done a good job with this one."
3,It could have been better.,"I'm a big Left Behind fan, but this book just didn't do it for me. It was as though the authors realized suddenly that they were 10 books into a 12 book series and only halfway through the 7 years, and they had to pick up the pace. So large portions of time were just skipped over.I'm going to continue reading the series, but I hope the rest of the books aren't like this one. A disappointing 10th book in an otherwise wonderfully addictive series."
5,Very Well Balanced,"This book is one of the best in the series. I bought it on the day it was released and have read through it in less than 48 hours. This book was definitely very well balanced between action and character building. It also moved over a much greater time span (over a year) than the last two. While the character building does slow things down, it is not nearly as tedious as it was in THE ASSASINS and THE INDWELLING. It also adds more action and more of the end time's plagues which makes the book more appealing. All in all, I say that Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye have finally gone back to what made the series so popular to begin with. Strong deep characters with a lot of action and suspense. If you had trouble getting through the last few books in the series, skip them and get the one."
1,They have lost their way.,"I loved the first nine books in this series. I loved their imagination and interpretation of the end of days. They did a great job in the first few books to really build the characters and involve you in their struggle. I could not put the first 5 books down. I read them straight through. However, this book is just a list of events. It is neither engaging or addicting. It seems like they released this book because they feel a need to complete the series."
1,simply awful,"Regardless of your theological viewpoint on the endtimes, it is hard to get past the shallow, irritating characters, silly plotlines and insipid dialogue. The authors are doing a serious injustice to Christianity by continuing to churn out these poorly written books. My guess would be that most people buy them only because they have read the previous umpteen in the series and just want to see how it ends.Well, I have a suggestion for them: read the book of Revelation and you will get the idea and save some money."
5,The Remnant- Left Behind Series,One of the BEST books that I have read. You really need to read the WHOLE series to get the flow of what is going on. I would recommend everyone to read the book. It is all in the series of LEFT BEHIND by Tim LaHaye.
4,COOL,Got this book for my grandma. the huge print was an extra and the cost was great. The book was like new no marks or torn pages.
4,The Remnant is Gathered and Protected in Petra..,"I just finished Armageddon, and I am writing a review for both of these books right now.This series did seem to drag a little slower in the middle books, but this book, The Remnant, and Armageddon both kept my interest rivetted to the pages and I am thirsting for more.The series picks up in this installment and takes some giant leaps in the next book. I am still VERY hooked on this series!"
2,"Alright, already...","Loved the first several in the series, but now I feel like it's all a rehash with no new material. Character development is weak. Still worth reading, but just doesn't have the emotion of the first books in the series."
1,Too wordy & repetitiousI,"I read the first two-thirds of this book hoping for some action and less conversation. Finally in the last third the plot picked up. This book is not up to the standard of the rest. I thought it was very tedious reading, in fact very boring."
2,Milking It...,Seems to me the authors of the Left Behind series are milking it for everything it's worth. I've been a loyal fan of the series but The Remnant was very disappointing. It left me wondering how I'd get through another year (and two more books) of the Tribulation.
1,Jesus's Own Jihad,"Typical of the later day tripe drummed up by those that would save me from myself, it's a bore from cover to cover, as was the rest of the series. Were it not a Costco-line read, in depth and content, I probably wouldn't have made it this far. For a quick reference, try The Confessions of Alistair Crowley. No big fan, me, but his old man, another evangelical nut case, swore that any day [now] the Armageddon would commence and JC would return to watch the non-believers burn, baby burn. And that was like 150 years ago. Oh, but the ""signs"" were all there, for the ""seers""... Folks, it ain't gonna happen. Will we burn? probably, but you can thank your elected officials for that probability, not good god, sitting on high. Save your money and watch TV, at least on TV you get a little superficial love and affection served up with your daily dose of guilt and violence."
2,Ready.... FIRE! Aim...,"Wow.. Did this book miss the mark.. (no pun intended). I am a hyper fan of the left-behind series, and this one left me in a serious lurch. I think they're not sure how in the world to dramatize the end of life as we know it before the armageddon. This book meanders around, and has zero focus. The first 210 pages of the book revolved around the crew in Greece. Its so pathetically looking for page material, you wonder why in the world they published it. In prior books, many things would be going on, and a little operation like the one in Greece would only have taken a few pages in any other book, certainly not the 200+ pages this monstrosity devotes to it.I will still be devoted to the series however; I can't imagine its easy writing about the Apoacalypse, how to describe what will happen then is difficult. I'm dying for the next Dramatic audio series to come out, what a phenominal job they do.God Bless!"
1,A HUGE disappointment,"This book, like all the ones following the first one, is a big disapointment. The authors are stretching this story too much because of marketting strategy. For example, the whole rescue operation for Sebastian could have been written in half the amount of pages it took. I find it really insulting that we have to wait a whole year for a book with mediocre writting and diluted storyline. In my opinion the series should have been over by now. This book is not even a good paper weight."
5,This book is one of the best written ones of the series,"Basically, a satisfying read and this one is better written. One can tell more time was taken to write this one. Despite others' complaints in this forum, I found the second half to be a refreshing change of pace (after all how many airport escapes has been in this series......dozens!....hopefully there will be no more....enough is enough)"
2,Going Downhill,"I really loved the first few books in the series, and really liked the next few. The previous book and this one, however, are really going downhill. This book contained a lot of filler and just didn't keep my attention like the books earlier in the series did. I think it's time for the series to be closed out instead of stretched out."
2,"Take some hints from ""Readers Digest Condensed Books""","This series which started with such a bang has been s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d out far too long - the decision appears to have been made to go for sales at the expense of the story. The Remnant is very well written, but you get the feeling it could have been edited into one or two chapters in one of the other books. Also, the villains are less menacing than farcical at this point and there are so many pages to fill that they're running out of ways to keep the bar high. This may be the last book in the series I purchase - now I'll wait until they're available at the library."
4,Getting long,Though I thought that this was a very good book to go along with the amazing previous 9 books I have read it seems as though it is getting a bit repeditive. I would recommend reading it but expect some slow parts.
1,Disappointed with the narrator,"I have purchased all of the Left Behind series books in audio form to listen in my car when traveling. They were all fantastic with Frank Muller. This one I shut off before listening to all of the first tape as I could not get into it. The narrator makes all the difference in the world. I hope that before the next one comes out, contact is made with Mr. Muller to do the reading.Please, please go back. I will not purchase the next one if it has the same format as this one."
1,Well below par...,"Boring. There is nothing to this tape. No real story, suspense or drama. The narration was well below par of the previous tapes. And, the music has got to go. You get three minutes of fluff at the start of the tape. I agree with an earlier review, either they are milking it or, he has lost what he is trying to say. All the previous books were better edited, narrated and written. I hope that the remaining tapes are of better quality as we pretty much no how the story is going to end."
4,Ever wonder...?,"To make this short, this is how it is going to be someday. I believe this series and the latest installment to be great reading and a keen insight to the coming tribulation the world will someday face. Read it - think about it - look around you and compare it to what is happening today and the book will take on a whole new light. Imagine yourself in the characters shoes. Rayford,Cloe,Buck and Chaim, and what they go through for what they know to be true. You won't be disappointed."
5,The beat goes on and on and on,"The book moves along at neck snapping speed, which is both a plus and a minus. Had to give the high mark, but I found ""DRIVEN"" by W. G. Griffiths to be the better read. Christian fiction has finally arrived."
1,Can Scim This In An Hour...,"Gosh darn, I ain't no speed reader but...This book is so wordy and full of redundant adjectives, you can read the first sentence of every paragraph and be done in about an hour. The publisher obviously pays by the word.The story? We're in trouble, call Chang. Rivers of blood. Another curse. Car wrecks....jeesh!This almost reads like a comic book.Check the book out for two weeks and feel good about yourself when it's back in the book return within 48 hours.Very, very weak."
5,The Remnant: On the Brink of Armageddon (Left Behind),"This entire series of ""Left Behind"" was wonderful. It certainly makes you think of what is happening now. A must read and worth reading again."
1,Not arrived,Has not arrived. I can not hate something that I do not have. When it gets here I will rate it.
4,The Left Behind Series,"This is one of the best series I have read. I think the Jenkins and LeHaye, have captured the end of times as close as humans could. I was beginning to think with the two books before the Remnant, that Carpathia was messing with them a little, since the 9th book was not very good. The series was feeling streatched too thin. Making money is the reason for writing them, I understand that. But please don't drag them out just to sell the most books. The Remnant looks like they are picking it up again. I sincerly hope so. They are fantastic books,and I know quite a few people that have turned back to their faiths after reading them."
3,The Remnant,"I think all of the Left Behind books are wonderful, but for some reason "" The Remnant"" was slow to build suspense and had alot of time gaps. I still encourage people to read the series, because of the literal interpretation of Revelation, you can really go back into your Bible and say,"" Oh yeah, I understand that because that happened to Rayford and Chloe and that's what it means."" I don't agree with some who say that the end of the Great Tribulation is ""The End"" of the world, because the world will never end,( Revelation 21:3-4)"
1,Note To Tim and Jerry,"First off, stop lying on the back of the book Jacket. Everybody knows that you live in the same basement.Second off, to qoute John Irving, a real writer, ""You should stop trying to write books, or try a lot harder."""
4,Another non-stop page turner,"Once again, the Left Behind series never fairs to deliever a message AND a great story to boot!! I look forward to the next (and last???) two books."
1,What a load of crap,"I work in an office where most of my fellow employees are fundamentalist holyrollers and biblethumpers. I finally gave in and read one of the ""Left Behind"" books -- this one. One-hundred percent crap. Not even good fiction. I shake my head in wonder that people can really, truly believe the ""Left Behind"" books are great reading. But, then, anyone who would believe that the bible is literal, actual truth will believe anything."
2,Pick it up a little...,"While I keep reading these books to find out what happens next, I find myself fast-scanning many boring parts to get to more meaty storylines. This began during book 3 and I find myself doing it more frequently. It is becoming apparent that the authors are either being pressured by the publishers or themselves to churn these out faster. In my humble or otherwise opinion, they could be at the same point of the Tribulation with about 60% to 70% of the text to date, with a lot more bang-for-your-buck page turning excitement along the way."
1,Don't bother,"I picked up this book because I'm a fan of apocolyptic fiction... Christ Clone, Conquest of Paradise, The Last Days... I was hoping for more of the same. I was never a big fan of the Left Behind series anyway, and the Remnant just bored me to tears. The theological backing for this book is hardly examined, nor are the characters fleshed out... Even if you do like the Christian genre, like I do, you will be disappointed."
3,Remnant,"I love this series, and I am always anticipating the next book to come, even though the last few have seemed on the slow side. After reading this book, I am back on track - looking forward to the next one. The book spans over a long period of time as all the tribulation saints await for the appearing. The last few chapters are really speeding things up, and I'm expecting the next one to be even better!"
3,The beginning of the Great Tribulation,"This 10th. book in the ""Left Behind"" series begins with the bombing of Petra which is ineffective against the Believers. The book continues with Chang, the Christian mole, dodging bullets at GC Headquarters, and Chloe, Hannah and Mac attempting to rescue George from Greece. The Bowl Judgments begin to pour onto the Earth and it's evident that the Believers are immune, while the GC loyalists suffer greatly. The style in this book is similar to the rest of the series, with scatter-shot views of events occurring in different places in the world. The later books are certainly less compelling than the earlier ones, but I keep buying these books and reading them to see how it all turns out (although Revelation tells us that!) Kudos to the authors who, while not the greatest of literary talents, have certainly focused people's attention on the Tribulation as no other modern writers have."
1,The Remnant,The Remnant; It is very difficult to review this book due to the fact that I haven't received it yet.
5,Definitely a Page Turner,"To me this was like reading a science fiction story. I did not feel that any of it could happen. Of course, that is my perception. It was fast moving and unpredictible. I thought it was an overall good read. By the time you have gotten to the 10th book you care and wonder what is happening with the characters."
1,The Remnant,"LaHaye and Jenkins should go into dairy farming because they sure are good at milking this series for everything it's worth. When is it going to end? It's one boring encounter with the ""GC"" after another. I've read my last book in this series. However, if anyone has trouble sleeping I highly recommend it."
1,a million monkeys.,"You know that saying if you put a million monkeys in a room with a million typewriters, you'd come up with a book? Well.. I think that is theory in action here. This didn't even seem like a left behind book. It was a bunch of uncorrelated characters all doing thier own thing, in a post-trib setting. This was horrible writing, and the greece plot.. GEEZ.. Get over it already. It was seriously 1/2 -- I'm not kidding 1/2 of the book. This was terrible. I don't know if I'll get another left behind book if this is the slipshod quality they are moving to. blech!! I honestly think all the 5 star reviews are paid poster trying to get the ratings up. Don't believe it folks. The series is outstanding, but this book just blows."
1,Not Scripturally Sound and Poorly Written,"The pre-tribulation rapture is not taught in the Bible anywhere, thank God that post-tribulationism is gaining more of its ground back. The Left Behind series is going to devastate the Church in the last days."
1,Unbiblical Drivel,Rapture Theology is a garbage and so are the Left Behind books. Anyone who thinks that are scripturally accurate does not know scripture
1,Consider...,"Could there be more off-shoots and volumes of the Left Behind saga? Indeed there will. I must admit, the relentless marketing and didactic writing make me weary of the whole enterprise. But bashing the series doesn't do any good. I would instead urge anyone who is fascinated by this series to at least consider the fact that the millenial views it espouses have only recently gained this level of acceptance. In fact, it was in 19th century America that dispensational premillenialism exploded. The history of the Church does contain premillenial views, but other views of Revelation and the end times have had great support. Please consider a book like Mark Noll's Scandal of the Evangelical Mind, particularly its discussion of how these views came to thrive in the American context."
1,going through the motions,"What a disapointment! These guys are obviously running out of idea w/ this series! The series has always been badly written, but the compelling story used to hold me. No more! I doubt I'll read any more of the books. Clearly the authors are just keeping the story going for finacial reasons!"
3,The quality begins to fall off here,"Maybe it's just me, but up until this book, the authors seemed as if they were moving things foward at a fairly brisk pace. Here, it begins to feel like they are just drawing it out. I wouldn;t say you shouldn't keep reading, but be aware that there's not much payoff by this instalment. I'd suggest We All Fall Down by Brian Caldwell if you want your Apocalypse all in one pop. That book was dense with ideas and plot, much like these books would be if they had kept it to three or four."
2,If this is a sign of future books - I'll save my money...,"I'm halfway through this book and don't know if I will be able to finish it. This reads more like a Bruce Willis action film than it does about the rapture and battle of good against evil. I'm afraid the authors have forgotten the message they were trying to send with these books and seem to focus on more action and intrigue than sending a message about the scriptures. It's a real shame - up until the last 2 books I had throughly enjoyed this series - I just really feel that this is more geared towards Suspense and Action than it is focussed on God, Evil versus Good and Armageddon. Who knows, maybe the end of this book will have more redeeming qualities"
3,"Good story, bad time allocation","I thought this book was alright, but the authors are definitely losing their writing quality. It took me a while to get back on track with all the characters and such, but once I did, I found myself reading way too much about George Sebastian's rescue from Greece.The only major flaw I saw in the book deals with how fast time begins to move. It took 9 books to cover the first 4 years of the tribulation, but we covered 2 years in this one book. I felt like I missed something when I saw ""13 weeks later"" in one chapter. The end of the book gets really exciting as more bowl judgements are poured on the earth, but then the book ends.I sure hope LaHaye and Jenkins can get back the writing style they used for the previous books and not skip over some huge chucks of time in order to wrap the series in their fixed number of 12 books."
2,Not impressed.,"The Remnant is definitely not the best book in the series. Nor do I consider it to the be the worst (*cough*Soul Harvest*cough*), either.My biggest complaint is that the first half of the book covers about 3 days, and the last half covers about a year. It's gotten to the point where I believe the authors' favorite words are ""4 months later..."". Have they realized that they only have 2 books left to wrap up the series?Of course, no matter the quality, people like me will buy the next books, just because we can't stand not knowing what will happen. What if Christ returns the day before the publication of the last book.......... I won't complain! :)"
3,I'm starting to lose it!!,"I feel like I'm leaving the Remnant writing this. Maybe it's because I wait so long for the paperback version to come out, but I can't keep track of the characters anymore!! The authors have kindly supplied two pages of characters to refer to, but the plot has become very fluid. I get the impression that even the authors are now panicing to get the last book out,as near the end of The Remnant plagues come thick and fast..what would've normally taken at least two best selling novels to explain.I have brought all ten Left Behind books and unless the Lord comes early I will buy the eleventh..but I'm only doing that because I would look stupid not having the whole series from start to finish. If you have never read any left behind books before my advise is not to start with this one."
4,Decent,"I have always been a Left Behind fan ever since I read the first book. This book contain good enough drama, but that last two chapters were the most unique (in a bad way). Jenkin's basically gave the reader at visual rundown of the events to come, instead of having a cliffhanger. Overall the bestparts was the bomb at Petra and the magical healers."
1,Why bother?,"I picked up this book because I'm a fan of post-apocolyptic fiction...the Postman, A Boy and His Dog, the Plastic Eaters... I was hoping for more of the same. Never a big fan of the left behind series anyway, the Remnant just bored me to tears. The theological backing this book is not hardly examined, nor are the characters fleshed out. ... Even if you do like the christian genre you will be disappointed."
5,Awesome,"I loved every one of the books of this series. They read like suspense thrillers and it was difficult for me me to set aside until I finished each one. I was so impressed with them that I've told several others about them and, in fact, have loaned them out to others. I've not found one person that hasn't been really impressed with them. I definitely would recommend and, in fact, after reading the series I bought two others related to this series but not actually included in the series, written by the same authors. ."
1,Total loss of interest,"I've been reading the whole series, and I was OK until this volume. This one ... well, I found it really hard to finish.There is hardly any plot any more. The characterisation is weak, all of a sudden, and it's, well .... boring.This is a dog. Here's hoping #11 is better."
5,The Remnant,"I decided to finish the Left Behind series and I'm glad that I did.For those who are serious about their relationship with Jesus this series is a must read. I enjoyed the story line and descriptive language that painted a real picture of those who will be a part of the Jewish believers in Messiah waitng on His second coming. This book may be classified as Christian fiction, but the Scriptures are real and true!"
3,Disappointed,"I have been an avid follower of the Left Behind series since a friend led me to it. I am disappointed with this last book, though. The first 2/3 of the book is filler material and could be eliminated without affecting the storyline too much.However, the last 1/3 is terrific, so I have to say that I'm glad that I hung on to the end. Once again, we're left wanting more until the next book is released. I fully understand why that one won't be released until summer of 2003. Jesus is coming back, so you'd want this to be the best book of all! But I do think that the real ""meat"" of the last few books could have been condensed into one and not dragged out. This series really should have ended a few books back."
3,It's winding down...,"There are supposed to be 2 more books in this series. Hopefully, they will be better than this one. Although it's good, it covers about 2 years, and with all the jumps, I had to re-read sections twice to figure out where & when they were. There are also some new characters to add to the mix. Although this can be confusing, it's not too bad.Throughout the course of the book, we see Carpathia getting crazier, lots of plagues crammed into the last half of the book, and the potential for discovery increases. I thought that at times, Chang was a little too cocky and could easily have been discovered. Leah gets annoying, frankly. Chloe gets a mission beyond the Co-op.I enjoyed this book, but the large font and big margins made the book a lot longer than it had to be.I can't wait for the next one."
3,Not Fully One,"Thhere are often times where a good song doesn't absolutely deliver where it is performed by another artists. FOr Mary J. Blige, she has had some good collaborations like As with George Michael, and Ain't No Way with Whitney Houston at the VH1 Divas Live '99 concert. While those were good performances, her latest collabopration with U2 on a rendidtion of their universal track One doesn't have the simplistic feeling Bono and company made back in 1991. Although the track is fair, it just doesn't feel as strong. Although Mary does have a good voice, she just misses out on this collaboration.Song: C"
5,For those who'd like to sing along...,"Have you ever wanted music for some of the songs in Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings""? This book will let you do so.Consisting of six poem/songs from ""The Lord of the Rings"" and one from Tolkien's poem cycle ""The Adventures of Tom Bombadil"", the songs move in tone from seeking adventure (""The Road Goes Ever On) to melancholic (""Namarie"") to just plain rollicking fun (""Errantry"").The music fits well with the words, almost as if Tolkien himself had been leaning over Swann's shoulder dictating. It's easy to play, as well, leaving the performer (and the audience) to concentrate on the words.Finally, in the back, there's notes, translations, an explanations for ""Namarie"" and "" A Elboreth Gilthoniel"". Adding to the prettiness of the music, the script on each page is in Tolkien's own hand.All in all, it's a worthy addition to any Tolkien-lover's shelf, especially if you're a musician."
4,Interesting musical diversion for Tolkien fans,"I bought the hardcover version, and although the 'look' was old, the decoration of both the dust jacket and hardbinding was pleasing elvish script by Tolkien. The music itself takes a bit of getting into if you are not a proficient piano player (the music is for piano, voice and occasionally guitar) but once you have it down it is interesting listening to how Tolkien envisioned his music. This book was only 4 stars since there were many more songs from Tolkien's books I would have loved to have seen in here. Overall, very interesting for the musical Tolkien fans out there, but some favourite songs are missing, and the music can be difficult to play in places."
3,Music feels off,"The music is satisfactory, but does not accord with the poems or their original contexts - especially the Elvish songs, which Tolkien described in his books as beautiful and melodious. Also, the music lacks complexity and emotion. I would not recommend this book, as it is unchallenging and unrewarding for those with any experience in vocal music. Approximate Conservatory grade 3."
5,tour de force !!,"This is a wonderful book for all intellectual historians, and cultural historians interested in fin-de-siecle Austro-Hungary. It's a tour de force if ever there were one! But it manages to remain accecible at the same time.Also, while many have written about Freud, Wittgenstein, Schiele etc., Johnston talkes about the lesser known figures of the era. That is this book's niche."
3,Fun toy but this DOES NOT light up,"My son loves his light saber but it does not light up. I thought because it had a ""retail"" price of 16.99 it would but they jacked up the retail cost because of the little galactic hero that it comes with. Overall my son is having fun sword fighting with his dad and if it did light up it may be broke right now anyways due to the fun he has been having with dad."
4,Goodness in retrospect,"Looking back this album came out during the heyday of southern rock. It fit the bill very well sliding right in with Lynyrd Skynrd, Molly Hatchet and the rest. ""Lonesome Boy From Dixie"" is a very good poster child song of the era. It's a good song but also describes the times. ""In America"" was written in response to President Carter's ineptitude but it is still a good song. ""Legend Of Wooley Swamp"" is the hit on this album and it's good and worth th price if you're wondering."
2,Full Moon is (nearly) empty,"This is not one of Charlie's best efforts. Apart from The Legend of Wooley Swamp, which is a CDB classic, it's hardly representative of his best work. South Sea Song has to be about the worst song he's ever recorded. It sounds like a warmed-over Jimmy Buffett track, although I doubt Jimmy would touch it. Lonesome Boy From Dixie isn't bad, but kind of cliched, as is the inferior El Toreador. No Potion For the Pain is kind of bland, and Dance Gypsy Dance is ruined by female backing harmonies that sound like Olivia Newton John. Carolina is a heartfelt track, and Money isn't bad, but In America is an example of one of Charlie's worst traits - his penchant for jingoism."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,I HAVE PURCHASED HIGH END KENWOOD EQUIPMENT AND AN HATATCHI TVTHIS REMOTE COULD NOT LEARN THE REMOTES AND WAS UNABLE TO BE PROGRAMED TO RUN MY SYSTEM. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T EXPECT SONY TO BE ABLE TO HELP AT CUSTOMER CALL IN EITHER; THEY DID NOT KONW ENOUGH ABOUT THEIR EQUIPMENT TO HELP.
1,Don't buy this remote....,"I will make this review very simple. No matter what features you find attractive about this remote, its shear size makes the thing clunky and unuseable. Unless you have large hands, you will have trouble accessing all the buttons without 2 handing it. (make sure you go to a retail store and hold it first before you buy it)In terms of features, the remote has only the simplest of ""learning"" features. If you want a custom interface for a piece of hardware it doesn't have a code for.... good luck."
2,been returned...,"bought it, returned it, bought a Logitech Harmony remote. If you like touchscreens I suppose this is for you, my wife hated it, refused to use it. With a touchscreen you can't feel your way to a button, you have to be accurate and deliberate. Also doesn't make up well with Tivo, which is a big deal in my household.Pros:Cheap, not bad pc softwareCons:doesn't match up well with Tivo, I use my recv'r for sound this doesn't let the recv'r volume pass thru to other device menus like other universal remotes, bad ergonomics (not the best remote for one-hand use), actions didn't always work (ex. sometimes All-off would turn everything off, other times it wouldn't turn the tv off, even though it was aimed correctly)"
1,RM-AX4000 Junk,"This is not only a waste of money,but a waste of time. The set up disk wouldn't run. After two frustrating hours on the phone with a tech who hardling knew english,and she couldn't get this junk to work. It could not find the Sat.code, then it could not find the DVD codes, wouldn't pair up. In fact, it took any hour to set up a Sony sound system to a Sony remote. Need a say more. WHAT A WASTE. Sony should be ashamed!"
5,Great Remote,The remote is very easy to use and program. All of the functions are simple to operate and the screen is well lit for low light conditions.
2,Channel + did not work,"One of the most essential buttons on any remote is the Channel + button and it did not work straight out of the box. I returned it.Beyond that, setting it up takes time but is not difficult. I am just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out."
1,no good doesnt work for my electronics,I would have liked the product but it didnt work with my electronic equipment
4,Overall-Worth the hassle,"Initial setup could be complex for some, but considering all it is capable of i'd say it's worth the time investment."
4,Sony RM-AX4000 Remote,This is an excellent remote with relatively easy setup using your PC USB connection. It has many options for customizing and naming buttons. The only downside is it is somewhat large which makes one hand use difficult. I would recommend this product to anyone with multiple systems or a large number of components. I am very pleased with this purchase.
2,Sony RM-AX4000,"This is a poorly designed remote. I have six devices connected to my HD television set. The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and, in my case, routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote. I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly. At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to Replay TV (which cannot turn the TV on and off)."
5,Ultimate Guy's remote!,"I don't know why some people gave this remote such a low rating. I think that this is one of the best gadgets I own, and I buy a lot of stuff. It took up the space of 8 remotes on my living room table. It's a great buy for the money. I have been wanting one for years and am glad I bought it. I just wish I would have waited, since I paid about $120 with shipping. Previous comments on the software and programming are right on, as it does take a while to set up and the software it comes with sucks. But, I read that an updated program is available for download on Sony's website. If you have the patience, this remote is awesome! If not, well you might just end up with an expensive coaster that lights up blue when you put your beer down.As for the macros and express functions, I gave up on them. It was more frustrating than it was worth. But really, what's the difference if you save 5 seconds by turning everything off at once?"
3,Sony RM-AX4000 Home Theater Remote Control,I have this product for about 3 weeks. Generally the features and usability is within my expectation as I have previously owned a similar universal remote control product from Sony.The PC software to program the remote control is less intuitive. I still have difficulties customizing the buttons. The infrared beam can be more powerful.
5,Excelente producto,"La verdad este producto tecnicamente salvo mi vida, en mi casa poseo mas de diez controles de diferentes marcas, en fin, puedes programar este control remoto para que maneje ""TODOS LOS APARATOS ELECTRONICOS DE TU CASA"" incluso mi Direct TV, es una muy buena inversion que realmente vale la pena, easy to use, easy to programm, excellent product, go for it.. just buy it!!! belive me it's an excellent deal!!! i would give more than five stars on this product if i could... easy to handle... AMAZING DEAL!!"
3,cool but bulky,"it looks good but its really bulky. i havent tried it with any sony product but with other makes of tv / dvd etc etc, it does seem easy to use at first but all functions from the tv / dvd are not usable via the remote. more and fancy thing at home."
2,Disappointed,"I owned the original versiom of this product, and it performed well for 6 plus years. Regretably, it was dropped on a hardwood floor,and gone.I ordered the latest generation of the product, and to my dismay, I found that once correctly set-up, and out of nowhere, the remote would send strange signals. One of a nuber of examples: Push the favorites, and the power turns off. Not always, just enough to make you crazy!"
3,I guess it does the job,"I purchased this and it kinda serves its purpose although way to bulky and heavy. I used it for about 2 months and the batteries went dead. The software is terrible, easy to use but seems to be missing alot of features that could easily be added. In the long run I have now purchased a logitech 880 and I love it. This Sony remote ended up in my bedroom were I generally don't use it to much."
2,Sony Warranty,"I've had the unit for three weeks or so, now on the third set of batteries. Could not use PC Setup, kept getting an error message that Commander had insufficient available memory; OK, used Remote Setup. It works well for the first two or three commands, but then it slows down. For example, it turns on the Panasonic TV promptly (""Component"" ""TV"" ""Power""), then the trouble begins"": Pushing ""Input"" to go from Cable to DVD takes FOREVER.Called Sony at (800) 822-2217, spoke with ""Allen"" in the Phillipines for 43 minutes (cell phone, free on the weekends thank God). He diagnosed a defective unit, transferred me to ""Melissa"" in Customer Relations to send the replacement. Spoke with her for another 25 minutes (a lot of the 68 minutes was on ""Hold""). End Result: Sony MAY require me to pay $82.92 for a replacement because THE AMAZON PRICE IS TOO LOW (MSRP is $220). Needless to say, I'm returning it to Amazon.Just thought Amazon buyers of Sony products might be interested."
2,Product usage,I purchased thisi item to replace a similar older model sony remote. The new one I purchased has been found to be not user friendly and customer support was of no help. When programing the remote with the computer program it has difficulty matching with any reote that has more than one feature on it. And the online instruction manual does not solve the problem. Tech support could only repait what the manual said and had nothng additional to offer. It should be noted the software is PC only and will not work on a mac. In addition if you want to test the remote during programing the pc needs to ge hooked up and near the tv. This is a problem if you do not have an appropriate laptop. So far I have not been able to program this remote.
3,Great hardware crippled by dreadful software,"I've had my RM-AX4000 for about six months. The good news is that the hardware is every bit as good as the prior reviews say it is.The bad news is that the software is even worse than the prior reviews say it is. The remote isn't hard to program, but it is tedious and time consuming beyond belief. Nor can it be said that the pain of programming the AX4000 is a one time affair. The software doesn't transfer the existing customizations to a new computer as it should. Adding a new piece of equipment using a different computer than the one you originally used for set up returns you to the water torture that is the AX4000.I do not recommend this product in its present form. For those of you who already own one, my advice is that you should never, never get rid of the computer on which you originally programmed your AX4000. Backing up the hard drive with Norton Ghost would also be a good idea."
1,To complicated,Very frustrating device. To complicated. Go with Logitech Harmony series. Muchmore user friendly.
2,Bought it... Returned it...,"I thought this was going to be a great idea, the price was very good at the time, I was going to be able to replace a half dozen remotes, and I usually always like Sony products. However, this just didn't do it for me...The main problem for me was that the on-screen button area and text are too small to read without my glasses, which I don't wear when I watch TV, plus, you can't feel your way around the remote like you can with the normal raised remote buttons.The remote also does not do a good job of simulating things such as my Tivo remote. Also, while the box even said that it supported Tivo I had to go to the Sony web site and download the latest firmware for the remote before it even knew what Tivo was.Despite the issues listed above and others I tried to use this for a while, even though the rest of my family gave up on it right away, but after about a week I gave up and returned it...As usual, Amazon was great with their return process."
4,Good remote - easy to program,"I upgraded from Sony's previous Commander version, and I'm really glad I did. I'd had the previous one for 3 years, and it was starting to have issues (it had been dropped a few too many times). This Commander was really easy to program, because I got to do it all on the computer. You can even test it before closing out the program (using its emulator). The one beef I have is that many of the pre-programmed buttons that appear when you enter the code for your components need to be re-programmed, because the factory defaults don't necessarily work for the specific components. It just means that you have to spend an extra 5 minutes programming, which really isn't a big deal. I would highly recommend this item if you have more than 3 components that you operate with a remote."
1,Horrible product,"I rarely write reviews, but I feel compelled to warn people about this product. The software is so bad that the hours of time I have spent with it has negated any possible value this device could offer me. This is a terrible product. Sony should be ashamed of themselves."
5,Awesome job describing the abramelin in modern times,Newcomb does a fantastic job on explaining the Abramelin Operation of how to go about obtaining the Knowledge and Conversation of your Holy Guardian Angel. He takes all of the garbage out of the preparations and techniques. He gives a good description of 10 ways of achieving your goal which are very good even though they are basic. It is a perfect modern guide to the beginner interested in the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage. Highly Recommended!
3,"Great, if you are a beginner.","This book had a great deal of information. Being that I have been studying magick and the oocult for over 8 years, I did not really learn anything new. However if you are new to this subject (magick)this book would be a great starting point."
3,an interesting form of the Abramerlin,This book is a very good read for those of us who have tried the old methods represented in Mathers version of the Abramerlin.i AGREE WITH THE THE CONCEPTS OF NEW (old) AGE MAGIK IN THIS BOOK THEY WORK.
1,Bad product,"When I bought this product, I was excited about all of the functionality it had in one device. However, it broke within a couple of months so it didn't seem like very good quality. I would stay away from this MP3 player, especially since others are better quality and have come down in price."
1,we need complete seasons,"we need box sets of the seasons, music videos and all. this is pathetic. mike judge should be ashamed. this is a travesty"
4,Why Beavis & Butthead cant get any better than they are here...,"Ok, i am certainly a B&B; fan dont get me wrong, and i know there may be alternate and arguably more complete and authentic collections elsewhere; having said all that, the collections that are offered here on Amazon are in a class all by themselves! Amazon is absolutely destroying the prices offered by any of the other competitors. VUDU, XBOX marketplace... you name it and will spend a minimum or 10 or 12$ and beyond MORE per identical season than you will here! lets see...season 2- $16.99(VUDU) or $7.99(Amazon)season 3- 1360 points or roughly $17 (Xbox Market) or $8.99 (Amazon)Any questions? lol Props to Amazon for not just standing up with the competition, but stepping well ahead of them!"
4,Not my cup of tea but it was for my husband,"I tolerate this cartoon because my husband grew up with it and enjoys it. I watch it with him and it has it's brief moments of comedy. Aside from the content, the shipping was good and we didn't get any damaged disks or case."
1,Don't bother with this heavily edited release.,"Don't waste your money, if you truly enjoy B&BH, email me. I'm selling the complete series, unedited, + the movie and holiday specials and plenty of bonus material, not on this website, but a different one, I'm sure if I post the link here it'll be edited out, so I will try to include my email in this comment so that you can email me and I may link you. Hiphopologizt at gmail dot com"
2,Reminder of a great show,"I thought I was going to get to watch a show that I loved when I was younger. After watching all 3 volumes I laughed at the jokes that were there and was disappointed by everything that wasn't there. I can't believe that the creater of a show this good would decide to finally come out with dvds and then just chop it to bits. Thinking to himself, well I don't like this and that so I'm not going to put it on the dvds, who cares what the fans think it's my creation. Hopefully, Mike Judge will pull his head out of his ass and realize what he's done. Beavis and Butthead is coming back to Mtv in October, maybe that will be his motivation to rerelease all the original episodes in there original form plus extra, so we the fans can spend our money on something worth watching."
3,Cool - but overall let down,"More Beavis and Butthead! I don't know why some episodes were chosen over others... There are a few episodes where they were at Burger World on here, which is great, but what about all the other Burger World episodes that were just as good...I don't understand how Mike Judge decided which ones to put on and which ones not to....must have been a coin toss...because there are so many more great episodes of equal caliber as the ones presented here...."
3,this is the best we're gonna get...,"don't get me worng, i like these sets because i love the show and for the extras. but i would STRONGLY prefer if mike judge would release the season sets with OR without music videos. i would love it if he could have music videos on them. but that would cost millions.i say buy it anyway for the awesome show and extras. maybe if we buy them, he will have enough money to release season sets with music videos."
5,This rules,"Beavis & Butthead are now on DVD with selections of their best episodes, including an earlier work by Mike Judge...""Frog Baseball"""
1,Lame show,One of the worst shows in tv history. This show is for stoners to watch with munchies. It's the only way to find it funny and not loose more brain cells.
3,I keep feeding the cash cow,"I bought the original Mike Judge collection just to have the episodes that weren't included in the Time-Life series. So, I can't really complain about this volume any more than the first two, because I knew what I was getting in to.That said, there's so much missed potential in this entire collection. The episodes are sometimes censored, and by Volume 3, Beavis has yet to say ""fire"" without being ironic. Either Mike Judge is ashamed of the first two seasons of Beavis and Butthead, or MTV is afraid kids will find these discs and burn their trailers down again.Three discs for under $30 isn't a bad deal, but don't buy this collection expecting anything different from the first two."
3,Totally Disappointed In MR. Judge,"I could live with these 3 dvds if my favorite episode would have actually been on one of them, the Steamroller episode. I am just dumbfounded that an episode with a 9.5 rating on tvtome would not be included on these sets. The ratings on that site are VIEWERS ratings of the episodes they like. There are some good episodes on these dvds, but there are some very crappy ones that viewers gave lower ratings on. I am just p***** because my favorite episode was a lot better than some of the episodes that were put out. I can't smile about a dvd series release that doesn't include my favorite episode."
2,Title is misleading.,"I guess you can't expect too much for the price, but this isn't an in depth history of Gandhi. It actually provides very little information about the complexity of Gandhi's personality. This is more of a short essay written in praise of Gandhi and no analytical understanding of the man."
1,It did not give info,It really does not give any information.Plus it really was boring. The most boring book ever. DON'T READ THIS BOOK
3,A book written for Non Indians!,An Okay book.It does not cover well enough.The author is trying touch topics very superficially.The book will be worth reading for people with little knowledge on Gandhi
4,Non Violence verses submission,"I enjoyed the book, although it changed my previous views on an few fronts.I realized that Non violence didn't mean submission, Gandhi was such a strong man and accomplished so much through his ways. An old saying ""there are many ways to kill a cat"" applies to this great man who calmly quietly moved mountains.Let it be a lesson to the world powers fighting/wars only accomplish dead heros, ememies and many deaths of children and the innocent. Yes stand up for your rights/beliefs, your family and country, but do it with peace.I learnt a lot about myself and especially about Gandhi from the book."
2,"Not CRP, they are Meyle","I expectecd these to be CRP pullys, but instead they are Meyle pullys, MADE IN CHINA!!!They are getting hard to find, but I wanted everyone to know they are the Chinese ones and not of decent quality. Meyle is known for being junk. I am disppointed, but need them to get my car going again, so I'll suffer with them and hope they hold until I can get ones of better quality."
5,where to buy mp3,"Hello, I am desperatatly looking for the mp3 of Jerusalem of Gold, where can I buy it? Thanks very much in advance."
2,Mediocre,"Although this album contains some songs one might recognize, overall it is mediocre at best. None of the tracks stand out, and most of them foray into the cheesy category. Recycled beats and uncreativy permeates this lackluster effort."
3,good but not enough!,I was expecting much more from a Fashion tv collectio.Simply the music we usually listen playing on the channel. I think that they should spend more time to choose those songs that it is really hard to find. Anyway you cant say it is a waste to buy the collection but you can live without it!
3,STINKY,this scent stinks and the containers are extra small. all six lasted me about 2 weeks. the smell also isnt too strong so while your smoking u gotta keep spraying. i would advise another scent like lemon.
5,Works Great!,"Highly recommend this to cover up any odors you might not want people to smell in your car. Spray this liberally in your vehicle and within a good 15 seconds all odors disappear and are replaced by the faint scent of baby powder. Not sure about it being ""New Car Smell"" but it works GREAT at covering up odors in a hurry."
1,Defective product,"The product came defective, so I had to throw it away.I emailed the company three times and nobody ever answered back."
1,Unsatisfied customer,"I have used That New Car Smell fragrance many times in the past. Now this particular brand, I didn't care for at all. My husband sprayed it in the car while we all were in there, and needless to say, we all had to get out. The smell was something that I had never smelt before. I will never buy this brand. I know a good smell when I smell one, and this was definitely not one!!!"
1,"Yuk!! If new cars smelled like this, the automotive industries would need a bail out!!!","I purchased this product believing it to be the same as the original red, grey, and white label ""MEDO"" New Car air freshener that I had the fortunate pleasure of discovering after searching high and low, once sold at Target, which actually DID have a wonderful new car aroma...This one, on the other hand... EEEEWWWW! If you enjoy the smell of a Band-Aid and Formaldehyde cocktail, this scent is for you! It was not worth the 5 buck gamble, and I chuncked it right away! I found a different online store claiming to carry the original scent and have taken another chance, hopefully it will prove a wise move.THIS Ozium, does however, definately has a place among college pranksters, skunk handlers, and general mischievious no-good-deed-doers.This is the first review I have ever taken the time to give...thanks for reading!"
1,New Car? More like flood car...,"This is THE worst smelling ""freshener"" I have ever used. Its just a terrible smell. Like the other reviewer said, its very chemical in nature. I sprayed som in my living room to see what it was like and.....WOW. I opened the windoes pretty quick, I could not imagine this in a hot car. I picked it up for 1.50 at a BigLots and I feel ripped off.Dont buy it."
1,Ewww...thist stuff is so gross.,"Smells like old lady perfume. Smells *nothing* like a car, let alone a new one. I'm sayin' this stuff has the stank and it's POWERFUL!!! I sprayed some on a rag before I sprayed it in my car and it was so bad I had to take put the rag into a plastic zip-lock bag and throw it out. After I threw it out, the scent lingered on my skin and it made me so sick I had to shower.It doesn't smell like a new car. It smells like an old woman who wears too much perfume. It's not nice to smell and it will NEVER go away if you spray it in your car. I suppose it would be good for covering an unpleasant odor but I've bought a number of air fresheners for my car in the past few months and would have to recommend something else. There are far better products on the market for this purpose that aren't so offensive and aggressive."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,This stuff literally smells like air freshener in a Port-a-potty on a hot summer day. It's disgusting. Going to try The Chemical Guys New Car Scent and see how that goes.
5,Be shocked,"I saw Karen perform at the University of Kentucky in 1991. This book is a collection of her blistering spoken word pieces. Her monologues, ranging on topics from censorship to the pain of alienation to emotional/sexual abuse are at turns enraging, tragic, and unexpectedly humorous. Anyone who complains about her graphic use of language is missing the point. She wants to shock you, to make you angry, to make you think."
5,"Wow! ""Non sequitur"" aren't we smart.","The March 8th review said, ""...16's argument is illogical, because it is a non sequitur, whose conclusion does not follow from its premises."" Why didn't he just say, ""... is an non sequitur, because it is a non sequitur, which is a non sequitur.""By the way, the fossil record has not been kind to Darwin of late. Evolution may adequately explain gradual change within a species, but runs into difficulty explaining changes from one species to another. It gives no explanation other than luck for the multitude of fortuitous mutations that would have to occur simultaneously. The odds against this are staggering. So, should we be teaching this ""apparently false theory?"""
1,I wish I was blind...,"that way i wouldnt of actually seen this giant smelly piece of crapola. First of all there are no fights, there are multiple killing scenes but no actually fighting, and the killings scenes are all the same, fake weapons, fake blood, sped up to look fancy, all the killing and blood and even the weapons are done with computers, yes there are no actualy weapons during the ""fighting"", yeah those are great skillful works of art and highly entertaining, do you detect some sarcasm? YOU SHOULD. The performances are stiffer then the floor those crazy people were tap dancin on for an hour at the end, not really but you get the point. Theres some poor attempts at humor and drama, but pedofiles dont make good entertainment. See Kill bill instead, its only about 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times better. 0 out of a 10."
1,Savor the originals,Takashi Kitano's portrayal of Ichi-san is flat and utterly forgetable. This movie is a sorry attempt to cash in on the former glory of Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi. Kitano is is completely unengaging and fails to elicit any empathy with his character. Save your money and move on to the older iterations of the adventures of Zatoichi. They are in a class by themselves and much more entertaining.
5,A great movie,"Speaking of the final matsuri dance scenes in this film, instead of either reviling them (negative reviews) or trying to minimally justify and excuse them (positive reviews), reviewers here might want to consider that these are actually the heart, soul, and high-point of the film.These dance scenes ALONE are worth the price of this DVD! They are showing the mindless rhythmic energy of life that remains no matter who wins or loses. These scenes are a raw and gorgeous display of the animal energy which forms the root of samsara.In fact though I liked the entire movie quite a lot (especially Z'chi himself and his middle-aged girlfriend, the reason I've actually bought the DVD is simply to have the final matsuri dance scenes. One of the best dance scenes, and implicit philosophical statements, every put to film."
2,Leave the story as it was,"I have been a long thime fan of the Zatoichi series, and was curious about what the take would be coming from Kitano. The film is worth seing if you are a fan of the series, it has all the elements of a Zatoichi, but lacks the intense drama that acompanies the older films. Seeing Kitano as Zatoichi instead Katsu was just to weird. I also think the twist he decides to put in at the end is just to way over the top and I don't see why he thinks he can just change around a story that isnt even his. I gave this two stars."
2,Zatoichi 2003: Completely and Utterly overrated,"I am having an extremely difficult time understanding how anyone who has ever seen the original ""Zatoichi"" movies could possibly consider ""Zatoichi 2003"" a film that came even slightly close to an imitation of the originals. Although ""Zatoichi 2003"" was beautifully shot with lots of choreographed violence and action, the plot centers mostly on what I would have considered marginal characters rather than on what Zatoichi is doing. Zatoichi barely says anything in this film! Furthermore, the ending is absolutely preposterous and insultingly comical, making this mere below mediocre imitation of a flawless original feel even more like a parody than it was. ""Zatoichi 2003"" is to be enjoyed only by those who haven't ever seen the original films and like their movies depthless, shallow, and with lots of meaningless action."
5,Zatoichi the real blind swordsman,Definitely the finest Zatoichi ever. Kitano should do e few more before he gets too old for the role. I have been a fan of Zatoichi ever since I was a kid.
3,The Blind swordsman,"It was an intresting movie. Great sword Fighting,Blood effects were strange.Dancing threw me off. all in all I thought it was Great Japanese Cinema."
5,"Sonatine, with a decent bonus film to boot!","This is definitely worth purchasing for Sonatine; while I'm not sure why this film wasn't released on its own, I'm glad its reaching a wider audience because of the bonus film it came with, Zatoichi. Sonatine is one of the greatest films ever made, and this is a great deal."
3,Buyer Beware!,"While these songs are interesting there's only 2 on this CD.""Unsuffer Me"" and ""Everything Has Changed"". If you can pick it up for 2 or 3 dollars(and you can if you shop around)then pick it up.Do not pay more than that for this CD single. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,Amazing album,Kip Winger is my favorite musician so I love everything he does but this album is really special. It was written after the death of his first wife and shows his grieving process. Really beautiful musically and lyrically and despite the sad inspiration is both touching and uplifting at the same time. One of those albums you have to listen to all the way through b/c it really takes you on a beautiful journey.
3,Does it really work,"Not bad at seperating grease, some grease slips by. On the average tho 90% of the grease is retained when pouring off drippings."
1,This is a piece of junk,"I purchased the Weedeater XT114 at a local hardware store for some light duty trimming at my vacation home. I realize this is not a heavy duty trimmer, but it is so much less than that. You'd be better off buying a good pair of scissors for $5.00 and saving the $45.00. It just doesn't perform at all. Don't believe me? Try one out and you'll be cursing Poulan for putting their former good name on this worthless piece of plastic."
5,Wubby Rocks!,"My daughter loves her kitty Wubbanub! She is so cute holding onto it, and it helps her keep the Soothie (the only pacifier she'll take) close by. We're afraid it's going to be really hard to wean it away from her later on! Great product!"
3,cute,"My daughter loves the Wubbanub. I purchased the kitty. She is 3 1/2 months old so she can hug the kitty and hold the pacifier in her mouth. Terrific for those parents who are constantly putting the pacifier back in after their child is spitting it out. I do not recommend it for any child under 3 months. Downside to this great invention is you cannot sanitize the Soothie in the microwave, boiling water or dishwasher. It is not removable. So you must hand wash the Soothie and stuffed animal."
3,Nice idea...but...,It just didn't work for us. Could be partly due to the fact that my baby has decided that she will no longer accept anything but the breast. The kitten is cute; but the kitten face wasn't quite as cute as the photo shows. These are a bit pricey too.
5,"Four great old Lassie films, a fine performance by the 'Lassies'; toss in Elizabeth Taylor, and a fine cast of actors","These were some of the original Lassie films, and once you see them, you'll know why Lassie was so popular, from then, forward. The action and sets are very good, and the adventures are well done and believable. Lassie, the consumnate actress/actor, is gorgeous, brave and convincing.The outstanding cast of actors maintains the quality and interest of the stories, and you should find them very enjoyable, and your kids will love them. (despite the fact that it is a given that Lassie always comes out on top, and the bad guys lose. No mystery there.)The variety and depth of the characters she meets on her adventures are very well played, and even many or the antagonists are depicted as misguided, and many come around with improved attitudes, by the end of the films.These are films for the whole family to enjoy. I recommend them highly."
5,Silicone bake ware is great!,I was afraid to try cooking with silicone but I am sold on it. Everything I have made with it has turned out exceptional.
5,It can be a Cure for broken heart,"I think it's one of the best interpretation of Piazzolla.Piazzolla did not plan to make This suite, but I feelthey originally made a perfect suite.And all songs are True song of soul, I think."
5,As Advertised,"Had no problems with them. For smaller guages, I just tinned the wire and the screw was able to secure it."
5,great price,I loved them fit my receiver great would buy them if i need them.great price came to my house in a timely mannor
4,Thank you Atlona!,"This might be the only seller on Amazon that sells 2 pairs of banana plugs together. All the other sellers will sell a pair for about the same price Atlona is selling 2 pairs for. The quality is good for the price. However, I had some issues with installation but I found out that these plugs require you to screw down the cable. To me, this doesn't seem that secure because the only thing that is holding your wire to the plug is the screw, but it does work. Thanks Atlona!"
4,"works well, but...","there were plenty of options for Banana Plug connectors on Amazon; i made this purchase because Atlona offered the best 'per connector' option of all.I did have some challenge ensuring my speaker wire stayed snug inside the connector. Initially, the screw mechanism simply didn't grip the wire snug enough, though this may have been partially due to my choice of speaker wire (16 gauge). Better results were found when I 'doubled' my speaker wire up (that is, stripped an additional 3/4"" & folded it over onto itself) & heavily tightened down the locking screw. This greatly improved the connection. A larger gauge wire will ensure best results, i'm sure.All in all, i'd buy 'em again..."
4,On the money,Product was perfect match for my bike and included new hardware. It was the same thickness as the original hanger and I had no problems attaching it to my bike or attaching the derailleur to the hanger.
2,Don't waste you money.,I actually drive a car that is notorious for excessive amounts of brake dust so I was really excited to try this product out. The Wheel Wax did add shine to the wheels after applying but I bought this to minimize the amount of brake dust accumulation. It DIDN'T work at all. I still get the same amount of brake dust and dirt then I did before. I don't recommend this product.
3,"Shines, Easy to clean but does not repel","As others have mentioned, this product does not repel brake dust. It does however add a nice shine to the wheels, and it does make them easier to clean, so for that reason I would recommend the product. Took me about 15 mins to apply to the wheels."
2,Just wax,This product definitely does NOT repel brake dust as claimed by the manufacturer. It does make the rims shiny but any wax should do that.
5,"Fantastic protection, simple application","Brake dust just rinses off, and no need for the harsher chemicals. One hint, thoroughly clean the wheels prior to application. Any remaining material will get caught in the application cloth and can cause scratching."
5,VERY HAPPY IMPORTER (UK BUYER),"I've been interested in getting this but wanted to the buy UK releases problem was they stopped after only #3! due to distribultion issues & licencing (Like Welcome to the NHK which never even made the UK with ADV's collapse)So when I got the ad in my email about SAVE anime and saw The Sakura Set I just had to have it and at 10 bucks their was NO IMPORT TAX!So far I've really enjoyed the story, its your typical unlucky nice guy and the girl next door that easily misunderstands situations. Hilarity often ensues...If your a fan or Ai Yori Aoshi & Love Hina I highly recommend it A+++++"
3,Not for me.,"This is one of those series that either keep you enrapt, or just doesn't. For me, the artistry was great, and the story was good, but it just didn't keep my interest. That's not to say it's not good. It is. It's just not the type of story I am interested in."
5,good stuff,"Suzuka is an awesome series, the commentary was a nice bonus, shipping was quick and well packaged."
2,Does the manga no justice!,"Suzuka is a sports-themed comedy that intersects the pursuit of love and athletics. The story is based around Yamato Akitsuki, a young man from rural Hiroshima Prefecture moving to the big city of Tokyo, and his new next-door neighbor, Suzuka Asahina, a skilled high jumper. Yamoto falls in love with Suzuka and pursuing a relationship with her he joins the track and field team hoping to impress her. After joining, Yamoto discovers that he has the potential to become a top hundred-meter sprinter. The Manga is top notch and well told, while anime fails to capture what made the manga so great. The story only goes up to the end of Yamato's freshman year and never really shows us what the story is capable of. It isn't bad, but they could have kept going. Also the Dub is decent and the English voice actors do a decent job of bringing these character's to life."
3,good,it was a good show but i read the manga and the show cut alot of stuff out. if u did not read the manga you will not know the difference.
1,Cliches Galore.,"I bought Suzaka at my local video store, and I have to say it's a pretty weak show. The animation is pretty cheap, and theres not that many good moments in the show. I myself bought it on a whim because I though I would find the Track & Field elements interesting, and I did. However just as you get into those elements, the romance/SOL kicks back in. which I would'nt mind if it was actually well done, however the way the characters & romance are portrayed in this Anime is fairly weak. And again, the series feels Bipolar at times, it wants to be a SOL/Romance & a Sports anime, and kind of fails at both. Overall its decent enough for what it is I guess, I'd give it a solid C. However, I would stick to the Manga for this particular series, which I have heard many say is far better, and has nicer art, lol."
1,Aweful -- not worth reading! Slapped together oral history,This book seems like a real rush job. There were no maps and no narrative to tie the stories together. It's hardly complete the most important campiagns such as Germany are missing.OSS is given short shift to compared to SOEFlow is aweful and very disjointed even for an oral history.
4,"Reminds Huntington Beach, California Dude","Dude, Reminds me of home. Sunny days, the beach, and happy-go-lucky-est-ly-ness of youth. Not a care in the world but your life! Skate!"
4,"Surf Punks : ""My Beach""","This brings back some fun old memories. These guys weren't very talented musicians, but these songs were funny as hell. Something everyone enjoyed at the time....I can remember listening to this over and over back in the very early 80's. I was a surf punk myself back then, and this was always in the cassette player when we would go searching for waves. Some good old times indeed. I don't listen to it anymore, but still, even the teenagers these days would like this, and find it very amusing...SURF PUNKS!!!"
5,If You Grew Up In San Diego...,"If you grew up in San Diego California during the 1980's then you have got to remember the Surf Punks on the turn table, Larry Himmel on the television and, Roger Hedgecock on the radio. No, there was nothing finer than San Diego At Large, Skippy and Biff going to El Cajon and being careful to not drink the water because it was east of I-805, finding a hard place to park at La Jolla Cove to go SCUBA diving, and the girls on Mission Beech watching you try to surf when the waves would not form. Use Audacity and Magix to make some cool ring tones of these tunes!The Surf Punks bring it all back. See them on You Tube and if you like, buy. Too bad I lost the old vinyl."
5,outstanding!,"The 77's are one of the most amazingly talented bands out there. Too bad most people don't know it. ""Pray Naked"" is a masterpiece. Each song is thoughtfully written, musically as well as lyrically. ""The Rain Kept Falling in Love"" is one of my favorites, as well as ""Look"". No matter what kind of music you like, fast or slow or in between, this CD has it. Mike Roe is simply amazing, as is the A-Train (Aaron Smith) on the drums. Buy this, you will NOT be disappointed.Tip: If you can find ""Sticks and Stones"", that album is even better than this one, using an excellent mix of their classics and rarer finds. ""Do It For Love"" (one of my favorites) is one of their original recordings."
5,Best Cookbook ever,"This has turned out to be one of the best recipe books from the White House. Verdon really outdid himself and I still use some of the recipies today. had to fight cousin for the book. Then sadly I lost it when home burned. Therefore, the reason Im ordering again. your kitchen library shouldn't be without this one."
5,GREAT SERVICE,My book arrived very quickly just a few days after I placed the order and that is 5-Star service!I already knew the book and I am very pleased to have a copy of it.JPI
2,Not exactly Truth in Packaging.,"...I ordered this book as a gift for my brother-in-law, who's into motorcycles. I thought the book would be exactly what the title said: a celebration of the long, proud history of Harley-Davidson, replete with gorgeous, suitable-for-framing photos of the company's products. The book arrived. I took one look at it, and gave it instead to my friend Bob, who has a taste for oddities. Bob took one look at it, and exclaimed, ""THIS IS A COFFEE-TABLE BOOK ABOUT HELL'S ANGELS!"" As indeed it is, down to the last bike-chain-wielding bruiser and Jello-wrestling biker babe. Sure, they all ride Harleys, but Harley-Davidson itself is--shall we say--peripheral to the book's actual theme. The photos are very well-done, if suitable-for-framing pix of Hell's Angels are what you want."
5,david sylvian: brilliant trees,"This album was purchased to replace on old CD that finally died...lol!I am a drummer you see, and the opening track, 'Pulling Punches', is just one of the funkiest Rock tracks I know of...a great groove, and some excellent music all round. The 'trumpet' solo in particular stands out as a great part of the song too. David Sylvian has a great voice, and the whole album is a great example of the then contemporary Rock that he played, both solo, and as the lead singer with the band Japan!"
3,"Brilliant Trees, almost there","Brilliant Trees is a great effort for it's time. Sylvian has polished this type of sound in his amazing ""Secrets of the Beehive"". If you loved ""Secrets of the Beehive"" and are craving more, Brilliant Trees will show you how he got there. An early effort, but still one of his top 10 LPs."

1,Not worth it,"The book was very worn, with post-it notes still in it and extensive highlighting and writing inside."
2,Nordic Ware Grilling Essentials Pizza Grill Topper 12 Inch Round,"The grill pan is listed as 12inch round but no actual pan outside dimension was listed. Toaster ovens like my Cusinart that fit a 12"" (medium pizza) will not come close to fitting this pan. So to use this pan I need to use a full size oven, not nearly as economical. I thought this would catch the edge drippings but still have a crispy crust due to the large holes. Since its TOO big, it caught any drippings but the pizza was noticeable less crisp. Would not have purchased if actual dimensions were listed or a warning that it is not intended for use in toaster ovens."
5,Outdoor Emergency Care,"Excellent book. From ""First Impression"" to splinting and bandaging... excellent preparation for anyone wishing to be prepared for emergencies in the outdoors. A MUST for ski patrol candidates."
4,Easy-to-follow handbook about coaching sales teams,"A huge difference separates being a great salesperson and creating one. And being a good salesperson doesn't necessarily mean that you have the skills or knowledge to coach or create another good salesperson. This book helps you defy the Peter Principle by teaching you how to coach a sales team to greatness. Sales training consultants Steve Johnson and Adam Shaivitz created this easy-to-follow handbook. They cover all the basics, including developing sales goals and a plan to meet them, teaching and reinforcing essential sales skills, training in the field, running effective sales meetings and providing constructive feedback. The authors stick to what they know best and, although the result isn't particularly original, it does provide a step-by-step template for managing a sales team and pumping up their performance. We recommend this book to anyone who wants to make the transition from salesperson to sales department manager."
4,help spring your sales team into action,"Sales is the life breath of a company. Without revenue from sales coming in the door, those doors will soon slam shut. Johnson and Shavitz have four words to help spring your sales team into action. ""Shape up or Ship out."" Not only is there no shame in letting low performance sales people know that their jobs are on the line if they don't measure up, it's vital to keeping the rest of the sales team motivated. ""Selling is Everyone Business"" shows the sales manager, or coach, the tools and techniques necessary for successful cold calling, converting and closing.Dee Powerauthor of The Making of a Bestseller: Success Stories from Authors and the Editors, Agents, and Booksellers Behind Them, Inside Secrets To Venture Capital, and Attracting Capital from Angels."
3,Selling is Everyone's Business : What it Takes to Create a Great Salesperson,good summary -- nothing new... it was as one read book
1,Slow movie. Awful playback restrictions.,The movie is slow; poor production quality. Trying to play the thing is worse. You have to use WMP10 with internet access. You can't just have a universal video file. Amazon movies Not recommended.
1,look for another book on theFrench and Indian war,I have tried to read all the books I could find on the French and Indian war. This one has some good points. But the points are few and in between. You go from talking about how the weapons of that day worked. To weapons in World War 2. I think years have passed between the two wars. Their is alot more problems with this book. So look for another one.
1,Half a day of my life lost I'll never get back,"This book is terribly written and I wonder if the editor should ever have been paid. The author's documentation is poor and he plays it loose with his ""interpretation"" of history. His opinions overshadow throughout and he makes offensives statements about certain groups that even this ""political correctness"" foe finds distressing. I will not even begin to discuss the awful editing."
1,Avoid Yellow Snow,"I couldn't even finish this whateveritis, and that was with the personal carrot that I was going to document all the bad parts and let loose with a really good rant on Amazon. But I'd read a page, my blood pressure would sky-rocket and I've have to stop. It wasn't even a dislike based on his so-blatant-as-to-be-self-advertisement opinions, but the mere logic of his examples and sentences were too much to take. Having just finished Anderson's _A Crucible of War_ made this fiasco doubly painful."
3,19th century style history returns,"Author covered an interesting and infrequently examined period of early North American history. He presented a very detailed acount of episodes from the four ""French & Indian Wars"". However, as with Francis Parkman who wrote about this period back in the 19th century, his comments on native Americans are racist and show a cultural arrogance. His coverage of the French is biased in places while his treatment of things British and colonial is overdone at times. His discussion of Washington borders on hero worship. A more balanced treatment would make the book much better and more educational to newcomers to the subject."
5,Meticulously researched and superbly presented,"Military historian Robert Leckie presents an informative, fascinating, meticulously researched and superbly presented work of American history in ""A Few Acres Of Snow"": The Saga Of The French And Indian Wars. The reader is presented with the dramatic, extended, and savage conflict between England and France arising from their bitterly fought contest for supremacy in pre-Revolutionary America with both sides using Native American tribes as shock troops in bids for territorial dominance. Complete portraits emerge of key participants including George Washington, Samuel de Champlain, William Pitt, Edward Braddock, Count Frontenac, James Wolfe, Thomas Gage, and the Marquis de Montcalm. ""A Few Acres Of Snow"" is an important and very highly recommended addition to American pre-Colonial history collections and reading lists."
3,Interesting observations but appalling editing,"I find the conclusions Leckie draws from his research to be very interesting, sometimes very insightful, but I'm constantly balancing that against how he seems to draw a lot from little evidence.The writing is generally very good, but when it (or the editing is) bad, it's REALLY bad. Aside from the duplication mentioned above, Leckie also gets away with absurdities such as ""the sole and only credential"". Also, he presents a discussion about someone's viewpoint, which I have read two dozen times and STILL cannot understand (and I don't think I'm the problem).I'm not sure slogging through the messes is worth it to get the interesting details."
1,Find another book to learn about the North American battles...,"On paper, the concept for this book was decent. Discuss the founding and early colonization of America, discuss the relations of the French and English colonists with the American Indians, discuss the tensions leading up to the French-Indian War, etc. But, it is so long and drawn out that you begin to just jump to the specific parts that you're interested in: King Philip's War, Braddock, etc. It's especially bad for the biographies within the book: Columbus, Frontenac, etc.The author seems to be knowledgeable, but the presentation style in the book turns this subject into a long, boring lecture hall. My next goal is to find a better, more interesting book about this subject matter. I suggest that others should just bypass this one."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, TERRIBLE!","Do yourself a favor - dont bother with this one. It doesn't even qualify as history as far as I am concerned. Leckie comes off as a biased (he bashes female fighter pilots), racist (he flat out calls the Chinese a ""backward race"" and implies it's impossible for them to have been the inventor of gunpoweder!(see 51) and vindicative (he loves to bash on the British ever chance he gets) windbag. Nevermind that the first 30 some pages of the book put you to sleep going on and on about Columbus when what you bought the book for was the French and Indian Wars. What ever happened to objectivety? I am so disgusted with this book and this author I just can't get over it. I could spend well over a thousands words illustrating just how terrible this book is, but it would be much easier to just take the high road and discuss its merits: well, dang, there are none. That was easier than I thought. So much for the high road."
1,A publishing travesty,"This book is so poorly written that I could not get beyond the first 30 pages. I returned it to the bookstore, telling them it was unreadable. They gave me my money back. I cannot imagine a reputable publisher having put this piece of garbage into print. For some of the specific complaints that readers had with it, see the other reviews. This is an especially significant problem because it is the only book published in this generation which purports to cover all four of the French and Indian Wars. That period of hisory deserves much better than this publishing travesty."
1,Waste of money,"I have quite a large collection of books concerning the 18th century, primarily the F&I war era. When I heard about this book I looked forward to adding it to my library. Unfortuneately, I should not have. The book is poorly researched, if at all. If taken as a reference, it does nothing except propogate the inaccuracies that have plagued much literature on this timeframe. As sudent of the 18th century, I feel that this book was a waste of my time and money"
1,Awful.,"I am an unabashed fan of Robert Leckie's works but this effort is poor at best. There really is nothing new here. Most of this work is of exceedingly poor quality, no footnotes, no bibliography, and no substantiation of the story being told. Altogether, it is an amazing disappointment."
1,A Great Story Gone Bad,"Robert Leckie has managed to take a great and fascinating time in American history and turn it into a thoroughly pedestrian affair. Leckie conveys little of the excitement and interest of the times and is rather short on facts, as well. In fact, too often he seems more interested in venting his curmudgeonly opinions about such irrelevant matters as women in today's armed forces. As if the poor quality of the writing weren't detriment enough, the proof reading job on the volume is abysmal, the maps are inadequate, and there are few illustrations (although many are available) to convey the color of the times. A very disappointing volume."
2,Ruined by a Grinding Axe,"A ""saga"" of an important historical period in the settling of the North American continent by the European powers.The author lost my interest in his prose and viewpoint by way of off-topic diatribes, sudden jumps in topic, and a readily apparent slant in his choice of quotes and verbage. Even his one ""digression"" in a footnote is a faulty argument.Even-handed this is not, therefore I don't see it of little value as a scholastic work since I'd have to question any and all of his assumptions by checking his source material."
4,Pretty good,"Strong characterizations and intriguing plot devices make this a good book that I am glad I discovered. What keeps it from getting one more star is the lack of payoff in what was a nice build up of sexual tension between Lottie and Sean. Their love scene is quickly glossed over in a couple of paragraphs, which may be just fine for many readers. I happen to prefer my romance quite a bit steamier, so that was a negative for me. If you want to read a really hot story with another hero from Ireland, you'll find a great one in ""The Irish Devil"" by Diane Whiteside."
2,Not so hot,"My husband used this on our front yard - because we have a lot of rocky terrain, we can not use a traditional lawn mower. obviously, the yard isn't that big (hence the electric trimmer, instead of gas). i wanted the thing mainly to be environmentally aware (no gas) and because it's not as noisy. well, the first time he used it, it started to smoke after about 20 minutes and that was the last time it worked. so now (sigh) we're going to a gas trimmer that i hope will be more reliable than this one. i suppose you get what you pay for, although it seems that there are some who have been pleased with this item. Good for them!"
5,Reading about Adapting Early Childhood Curricula,"This book is all inclusive. It speaks about different childhood and family dynamics, and how to make many different types of assessments. It talks about supporting and collaborating, for children with special needs.This book is highly recommended for individuals that are thinking about majoring in Special Education.I am going to keep this book permanently in my library."
1,BAD,"I waited a month and the book did not come, I emailed the seller, but they were unresponsive. It wasnt until I threatend to involve amazon did I recieve a responce. The person was unfriendly and dismissive. I would not purchase from this seller ever again."
4,My daughter loved it!,"I bought this in cassette form 4 years ago, and my daughter loved it! I am purchasing the CD for my son now! It may not be traditional, but it appeals to kids! I didn't like it at first, but my daughter did, and it grew on me!"
1,Superb nursery rhymes - very poor recording & arrangements,"The samples turned me off. I wanted very much to be pleased, but I wasn't. A much more traditional arrangement of the various rhymes would I believe sell in huge quantities!"
1,Don't get burned by this vendor,Be warned - this is NOT a genuine Canon cartridge - it is remanufactured. Any time you see a price this low for a cartridge like this you can be guaranteed it is not genuine (pretty much anything under $10 for this cartridge is guaranteed to be remanufactured).Check this vendor's feedback for proof.This is blatant false advertising - Amazon should not list this as new/genuine.
1,Does not fit 2001 zx6 Ninja,"The shape fits just like it should, but the top part of the air box has a section that protrudes through where the air filter would go and prevents the top of the airbox from fitting on. If you can visualize the top right section of the air filter needing to have a square indention to allow the airbox to fit on."
2,Sateen pillowcase,"Really unhappy with these pillowcases. They are so narrow that they didn't fit any of the 15 pillows I own. They wrinkle very badly. The material is soft to the touch, but they need ironing every day!"
5,Photoshop Raw - M.Aaland,"Minimum text balanced with excellent sidebar explanations, examples and illustrations made the book easy to read and understand, and to fully exploit the many features or RAW. Of particular interest was the coverage of colour balance, High Dynamic Range and Black and White conversion in RAW"
5,"Truly Celtic, truly beautiful","I found both CDs quite marvelous. The 'Silent Night' CD was all harp music, and that's as Irish as it gets. All renditions were reminiscent of my Irish parent's and granparent's favorite music, all wrapped up in Christmas joy and spirit.I gave this as a gift, and it was greatly appreciated. I plan to buy a copy for myself now!"
3,So-So,"I bought this because it was very inexpensive and I needed to stuff Christmas Stockings. I bought it for people who love Celtic music. It's a 2 CD set.... one of the CD's is very nice the other one.... forget it! I gave it 3 stars because the one CD truly deserves it.. the second cd I'll never listen to again... yeah, I bought one for myself as well as my Celtic Music gift recipients. Nothing to be excited about."
1,Doesn't live up to it's title,"After reading the reviews I thought this book is going to an interesting book regardless of horror stories or not. But it ended up being such a disappointment. I read the book a to z thinking I might've missed something interesting, but most of the stories were boring with capital B and I haven't found any scary stories in it. Heck some of the stories aren't even horror type (which I expected, but I didn't know majority of them are going to be like this). Save your money buy some other book."
4,Big rock for Big Lizard...................,This is a very cool heat rock.My Iguana loves this thing hespends his entire day basking in theheat this rock provides and eats hisvegan diet chilling all day like he is fromcalifornia... So if he is happy and so im I....
4,really big rock,this item is bigger than i thought or i just picked the wrong one. looks like it would do the job for a big aquariam or as a room warmer lol
4,Good content!,"The content of this program is excellent. The presenter actually could benefit from a program like Toastmasters for his presentation skills, but the information on developing excellent powerpoint presentations is outstanding. I highly recommend this program!"
3,Suspicious River,"Molly Parker was wasted in this movie! She`e a great actress but seemed held back. This was no CENTER OF THE WORLD. Maybe it was the woman director,they seem afraid too push the button all the way. Always want to focus on the man."
5,great movie,"I never heard of Suspicious River before buying it at Hollywood Video. Hollywood Video was closing in a few day's. There weren't many good movies left. I am a DVD colletor, so it didn't matter if it was good or not I bought it any ways.Well I really enjoyed Suspicious River. It is very sexual and crazy. I can't believe she trusted a man so much that she would let him do those things to her. I can understand the position she was in at the motel. If I didn't have respect in my self I would be doing the same thing with those guys.... lol. But that is just a sexual fantasy for me lol."
4,"Disturbing, thought-provoking, original","A small-town hotel clerk trapped in a lackluster marriage and backwater town near ""Suspicious River"" plans her escape from a life of loveless tedium by turning male guests into tricks at $60 a pop. Things spiral out of control when she falls in love with a rough-hewn stranger who turns out to be a thug, con-man, and pimp. A parallel story concerns the disintegrating marriage of the parents of little girl who seems to be a younger version of herself. The little girl and woman's lives intersect as the clerk flees for her life.Superb acting, original story, and relentlessly depressing."
5,Great text for any hospital dept manager,"Managing the Respiratory Care DepartmentI highly recommend this book for anyone in a hospital department leadership position. It is very imformative and well written. Compared to most ""dry"" textbooks, this one is a joy. The writing style is fun and interesting. I found myself laughing out loud in parts. The writer, while completely knowledgable, does not take himself too seriously. The book contains details and several appendices which allow the reader to use the information immediately. I refer back to the book often. While it is written from the perpective of managing a respiratory care department, the ideas are applicable to all hospital departments. It has fast become my favorite management text."
4,The Search for the Perfect Golf Club,"Easy reading, but in parts a little basic. More geared toward the novice player. He wants everyone to play with a 13 degree driver. I personally would like to see more scientific data such as how someone decides on the optimal driver setup with a launch monitor. What launch angle and spin are they looking for for a particular golfer. I agree that custom fitting is very helpful to playing your best and for me, confidence in knowing that the bad shot was due to me and not the equipment. That being said, skill and practice trumps everything else. Tiger could beat most anyone with a set of women's clubs."
4,Designing your own golf club,I found this book very helpful in identifying the characteristics I needed in my new driver. Well written!
5,Everything You Want To Know About Golf Clubs,This book is a thorough discussion of all of the parts of a golf club. If you want a better understanding of each components characteristics and how they relate to the performance of the club this is the book for you.
5,great quick reading with fantasy and detail,"Loved this book for its ease in readability and its absorbing power. The story moved fast, was exciting, griping, well thought out and convincing in its fantasy. The research efforts of the author were also apparent encouraging one to delve into the Welsh folklore and Arthurian traditions, as well as into natural remedies for healing the body."
2,Some disturbing images/sounds for very young children,"I bought this video for my two-year-old, who loves elephants. And he does love this video, but doesn't like to watch it alone. First, there are a couple of graphic shots of dead elephants. Then, there are some dramatic sound effects and intimidating angles of elephants' feet coming down. Also, one shot shows a man (in a studio), aiming a rifle at an elephant, and shooting. The elephant disappears, so we don't see the animal dying. Still, our son has focussed on that, talking about people shooting elephants. The bottom line is, it's an excellent video for older children, but I don't recommend it for the very, very young."
3,Housetraining for Dummies,This is a fair and basic guide to housetraining with some interesting facts about dogs and cats that assists in understanding the logic of the training.
4,my new puppy,"Length:: 2:33 Minshey, I've gotten a new puppy and I wanted to learn how to keep him and train him quickly. I want to share my experience with this book and show the value."
4,Very informative and well written,"This book gives a great deal of very good advice for housetraining your dog in several different ways. I have employed many of the techniques described in this book. My only wish is that more space had been devoted to indoor housetraining for smaller dogs and toy breeds. But, since indoor training is a relatively new concept and this book appears to have been published about five years ago, I can understand why more space was not devoted to the subject. And, admittedly, it is likely a rather small percentage of us for whom indoor training would apply. Overall, worth the read."
4,Best of 5,"I have 4 other analog video converters or capture devices and this is the first one that really works. It is the first firewire which seems to eliminate conflicts and input speed. The box works perfectly except it should have a pass-thru for the analog signal and it could use a better on/off switch. It has to be rebooted occasiionally and the switch is weak. I have two of these boxes and I love them. A better switch and the pass-thru would make it perfect. Capturing video is a lot tougher than you might think. This box does it very well. Perfect service from Amazon, as usual."
1,"TERRIBLE PRODUCT, EVEN WORK CUSTOMER SERVICE!!","I was so excited to get this product to finally convert old VHS tapes to digital files on my laptop. Well the first 2 times I used it, it worked great. I was so excited to have the ability to do this - then, the next time it used it, it just didn't work. No reason at all - the device hadn't been hit, dropped, etc. Basically it was still brand new and would have no reason for breaking. It just simply stopped working. So I called the customer support number and no matter what day of the week or time you call, the phone just rings and rings and rings and basically there is no service at all and nothing that can be done. I'm sure they're not still in business, with a product that only lasts 10 minutes before breaking. So take my advice and stay far away!!!!! Waste of money. I feel like I really lost on this one."
3,Good,The converter wasn't what I spected but I could do the work I needed. I will recommend it for house use only not for a professional business.
1,regretable item,"This product never worked. I tried different fire wire cords, I carried it by friends who are in the video business, and it still didn't work by them. I bought new cameras to try this product, still the video will not get detected on the computer. I then decided to dump it in a box and forget about it. I had to go back to the high priced canopus AD converter, which worked."
1,"mala compra, defectuosa y fragil.","este producto de pyro ads me salio defectuoso, es una mala compra creo es mejor gastar un poco mas en CANOPUS que en este producto tan malo, muestra pixeleada la imagen y trabado el video entrelazado. que mal"
3,NOT a Review! A Warning!,"Somebody at amazoo headquarters should get the Pulitzer this year, for proving what many have always suspected, i.e. that Yo-yo Ma is really an avatar of Mstislav Rostropovich! The evidence is here; while the CD being offered for sale clearly shows a picture of Ma, the samples and the MP3 feature the playing of Rostropovich. (Be careful, hasty shoppers! This confusion happens altogether too often chez amazon.)In any case, neither performance is worthy of being your first choice. The recent recording of concertos 1 & 2 by Jean-Guihen Queyras is a revelation of glory; Queyras plays the socks, pants, and shirt off any other cellist except Isserlis, who gets to keep his shirt."
4,A Splendid Performance,"I'm not very familiar with these concerti, but I think that this is a fine performance, wonderfully recorded. People can spend hours arguing over who performs it better, whether it's Rostropovich, Casals, Du Pre, Starker, whatever. They usually resort to highly personal and more-or-less improvised language, feeble attempts to describe what is really a very complex style and personality. They are all different performers with a different sense of color. I'm sure the other performances of these concerti are wonderful as well. This, though, is a great recording also."
5,Shannon's album is tight!,This is a great CD for a gift. This negroe has talent and he sings with intensity. I recommend this album to anyone.
4,Advancing the categorization of violent crimes,"I was greatly anticipating the delivery of this book as it had been labeled the ""DSM of Violent crimes"". Although I wouldn't apply the same label, for the DSM approaches mental illness in a drastically different way than the CCM approaches criminal investigation, this book is a great way to understand the ways in which the crimes can be differentiated based upon the evidence observed.Complete with case studies for each crime, this is one manual you can read from cover to cover."
3,Douglas Fans just HAVE to add this to the Collection!,"Let's face it! Thanks to John Douglas, you're an official ""amateur"" profiler! Now just add the ""Master's Teachings""!"
4,Great for catching bait,I like to use these to catch catfish bait. man they work well on sunfish and bluegills in the rocks. Wish size 16 were available though.
2,beware the overpraising review,"I bought this DVD based on the customers' reviews and because I love Wiest and like Birkin. They do, indeed, turn in good perofrmances. Now to Merchant/Ivory. If you, like me, find Merchant/Ivory bloodless and cerebral storytellers, you'll find nothing different here. The ""funny"" situations are made in the head and there's nothing organic or visceral about them. The opera scenes are so untrue they are insulting to opera-goers. (This is, after all, a film about an opera diva - among others!)Those who were rolling in the aisles while watching this film are cut from a very different cloth than I am. So beware: If Merchant/Ivory's ""serious"" films do not move you, this comedy won't, either. PS: I speak both English and French, so my reservation of this film was not based on a language problem."
5,BARBRA STREISAND: GUILTY,I have had this album in vinyl for many years and have always enjoyed hearing it. I'm very pleased with the DualDisc since I can see the artists performing on stage. Great idea: two in one!
1,Guilty Not A Remastered Masterpiece,"I was very excited knowing I was going to receive a remastered version of Barbra Streisand's Guilty album, one of her most popular albums of her career. Upon playing it, though, the audio quality, in addition to the importing quality ('ripping it' onto my pc's hard-drive) I found to be very sub-standard. Upon reading the sleeve of the album, it stated that ""Dual Discs"" didn't conform to the same high standards for their audio reproduction as regular CD's, so you can imagine how disappointed I was at the lack of both quality and a 'remastered sound', which was also - in my opinion - lacking. I therefore returned the item, and was further disappointed to be unable to find the regular CD remastered version (without the dual disc feature), for I wanted to reorder just the cd. I still am without this great album..."
4,gorgeous in voice and looks,barbra's voice is better than ever - and even shines through despite some sappy lyrics . Barry Gibb doesn't add much to the album besides an ability to wear tight pants
1,Good but I'm sorry I bought it!,"I got this to put on my iPod, shame this crummy disc can't be put on your own devices for your own, personal pleasure! I hope this puts a few pepole off buying this disc, another triumph for the greedy music industry!!! I'm afraid my blood pressure will rise every time I hear it so I won't be playing it!!"
4,one of my favorite albums all around,"From my teenage years, my first copy was vinyl, I knew that eventually I would be adding this to my collection.A wonderful all around album...oops..sorry cd.Now if I could only find ""Yentl"" on dvd I could join the ranks of my other friends with at least two pieces of Ms Streisand !!!"
4,Nice blast from the past,"A bit dated now, of course, but the combination of Babs' voice and Barry Gibb's late 70s Bee Gees ballad style was a sure win."
4,Guilty & Guilty Pleasures,Listening to Guilty I recalled how very nicethe Streisand and Gibb voices blended. I enjoyed hearing this pairing once again in their new CD Guilty Pleasures.
4,Play it again and again and again,Crikey! Can't get enough of this. Barb is just fantastic. She can sing like hell.But don't expect the blokes to like it: it's 'chick music'.
5,Easy-going Christmas,"This is the Christmas CD you'll reach for deep in December when you've heard one too many carols and radio stations are starting to repeat themselves. It has the fresh, upbeat sound that Fourplay always produces, and I like to listen to it all year. A surprise treat is a rendition of Joni Mitchell's ""River,"" which is quick and breezy, but tender. If you like smooth jazz and Fourplay, you'll want to add this to your Christmas music collection."
4,litter pan,"great litter box because of the high back. my kitties like to stick their butt in the air when they go and other litter pans were not high enough. urine would spray down the back and out the seam. this prevents that from happening. just what i was looking for. the side locks are not made with the highest quality, but as long as your careful when opening and shutting, they should last a long time."
5,Best litter box for the price!,"I read the user reviews that raved about this box, was skeptical but purchased anyway. I am so happy that I trusted the reviewers (thank you Barbara amd Herndon), because it truely is a GREAT DEAL. My cat loves to kick the litter everywhere - I'm not sure if he's really trying to cover his business or just likes kicking sand around. I previously purchaed a similar Petmate model (supposedly for large cats) for around $35, and there was barely room for Pan (my cat) with the lid on. This one is jumbo as the description states, and he has plenty of room so I can keep the lid on and vacuum less. The size is great for a large cat or one that likes to kick a lot. It has made my life much easier (less time with the dustbuster) and he clearly prefers the extra room! Unbeattable bargain for any cat lover!"
3,A little disappointed,"I ordered this litter box because I have a 20 lb Maine coon cat who needed something that he fit comfortably in. This is definitely not a ""jumbo"" litter box. When my cat goes in it he has to stand with his front legs and head outside of the box to do his business. It is also pretty cheaply made. The hood doesn't snap on tight, so if my cat wanted he could knock the top right off. If you have a large cat, I recommend a different box."
2,not what I ordered,The item I received was not what I ordered. It said the colors may vary but it did not say the brand or type of boxes. I also ordered four and received one. I will not order from this place again
4,perfect for the kickers,"This is a great litter box for the money. Saves a lot of clean up time. The only downside is that the door is a little low. Should be an inch higher, less mess."
4,Arkansas fan for Life,These guys are getting too good. They are better than most new artists on the radio daily. We will be hearing alot more from this crew.Keep up the flow''''America rocks the cradle you were born to.
4,"Sounds Good, Considering...","Here's to all you retarted reviewers out there (not literally) that reviewed this and other titles after one listen: you suck, you're garbage. Now, to the real deal...This is a semi-antichritian, hate-and-love throwdown. They can also sing like the gods they most likely don't worship. This band has it all, but it may not fit together properly--sort of like the situation with Audioslave where they are close to awesome and they could be there if they would just lean in the right direction rather than stumble down the other path. That kinda stuff is not enough to ruin this cd, in fact, it is still nearly awesome. And if you sing along to the dark-but-sweet lyrics, maybe you won't even notice how it sounds like Edwin McCain singing for the Toadies (can you imagine the ""I'll Be"" guy singing the Toadies' ""Possum Kingdom"": that's like what this is). Anyway, the parts are great so the combination is still good."
5,One of the best in Praise and Worship,"This album is one of the best album for praise and worship, especially if you like marches, strong & powerful, spiritual warfare kind of songs. The flow of this album is Fast-slow-fast.It begins with ""Let the Flame Burn Brighter"" - a rejoicing song.Follow by ""We Believe"", ""Jesus is our Battle Cry"" - proclaimation song.Then in the middle are slow ""Revive Us Again"", ""If My People Who Bear My Name"", ""Love of Christ Come Now"" - inner worship songs.And ends with ""King of the Nations"" - Praise song.the flow is simply perfect, you can just listen over and over again and you will never get bored of it.If you like this album, you should also check out Randy Rothwell's ""Army of God"" and ""Mighty Warrior"""
1,Inferior product,The plastic fitting that joins this extension to the trigger grip should have been much more sturdy or even brass if possible. The engineering of this is so inadequate for the purpose of the extended wand. It is only a matter of a short time before the plastic connection fatigues and cracks; even with the most gentle of back and forth spraying motion of the wand.
3,Walk a Mile!,"THE SPRAYER DOES SPRAY. WITH THAT SAID....IF YOU HAVE A LARGE AREA TO SPRAY YOU MUST WALK CIRCLES TO BUILD PRESSURE TO SPRAY ENTIRE AREA. THERE IS NOT ANYWAY TO PUMP TO BUILD PRESSURE BUT TO WALK AND WALK AND WALK.IF SPRAYING A LARGE AREA THERE SHOULD BE SOME ALTERNATIVE WAY TO BUILD PRESSURE.I WAS DISSAPPOINTED. THE SPRAYER WILL SIT IN SHED, VERY SORRY I BOUGHT. I BOUGHT DUE TO JUST HAVING NECK SURGERY AND I AM NOT ABLE TO CARRY A HEAVY SPRAYER."
4,Adds tremendous depth to Sup. Ct. decisions,"If you are a lawyer, or a student of the law, you will find this CD-ROM especially illuminating as it illuminates famous Sup. Ct. cases with the actual audio arguments and questions by the judges. The subsequent reasoning and decision of the Court is a lot clearer when viewed in the context of how the oral pleadings went. RealAudio compression allows dozens of hours of listenable audio to be burnt onto a single CD. Well worth it."
1,Proof that Philosophers are just people who love to talk,"I'm unlucky enough to be reading this book for a class on legal argumentation tactics. Unfortunately, this book, as others have noted, is the antimodel for strong rhetorical arguments, which Mr. Perelman claims to be espousing and instructing in this brick wall of flowery language submerging any instruction to be gained from it. Not only is the translation severely lacking so that one must constantly reread sentences in a desperate effort to ascertain what the author meant to say, but the book is far, far, far too long. Brevity is a virtue Mr. Perelman never seemed to have. Each possible topic and sub-topic is demonstrated with story upon story upon story. Many of these examples contradict themselves so the reader is further confused. I urge anyone hoping to use this book to learn about argumentation and tactics of rhetoric to steer clear."
2,"Brevity, Clarity, Plausibilty -versus- Prolixity, Opacity, Implausibility","Although this book does contain some useful, practical information, it is buried in a forest of non-essential modifiers, unnecessarily obscure polysyllabic terms, and tortured sentence structures. Cicero wrote that the essentials of a rhetorical presentation were brevity, clarity, and plausibility. Of these three essentials, ""The Realm of Rhetoric"" comes close to achieving only the third, and doesn't achieve that one well. The plausibility of an idea decreases as the opacity of its presentation increases.The ideas expressed in this book, if expressed with brevity and clarity, would probably make a good essay. Expressed with prolixity and opacity, they make for a tedious book. Aristotle, an author not noted as an easy read, did a much better job over 2,000 years ago in his seminal work ""On Rhetoric."""
2,Realm of retoric,This edition is too condensed to make much sense. You would be money ahead to get the 700 page hardback edition.
1,Overrated,"This book is a very poor translation - apparently written by someone for whom both the author's and the English language are foreign objects. Although the author has a couple of very good ideas, his thesis is ruined by his frequent reference to biblical stories as proofs of the points he is trying to make. Were he to rewrite the book with secular rather than biblical references and then get himself a really good translator, this book might even be useful. As it is, it is rather inaccessible."
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Loverboy's self titled debut album is one of the strongest debut albums that I have ever heard. I have to rank it up there with ""Boston"" and ""The Cars"" debut albums. The Kid is Hot Tonite gets things going, an excellent rocker to open the album with. Then the big hit Turn Me Loose is on. The whole first half is flawless, really the whole album is flawless. Although you may only know The Kid is Hot Tonite and Turn Me Loose from the radio, other songs like Always on My Mind, Lady of the 80s, Little Girl, Prissy Prissy, Teenage Overdose,DOA, and It Don't Matter are just as strong. This is where you should start your Loverboy collection."
3,Early 80's ROCK,"Loverboy's dubut album ""Loverboy"" starts out with two of my favorite 80's rock tunes, The Kid Is Hot Tonite"" and ""Turn Me Loose"". I remember back in my college days playing these songs prior to heading out to the clubs. Great party songs that brought us into the 80's and the MTV era!While ""The Kid"" has more of the traditional 80's sound, ""Turn Me Loose"" is heavier and has clearly stood the test of time. There are a few other good songs as well, such as ""Lady of the 80's"" and ""Always On My Mind"", but for me, everything else is pretty much filler. Three 1/2 stars (5 for the first 2 songs and 3 for the rest). Better off getting the Greatest Hits CD."
1,not mine,"Not mine bought them for my brother Not my kind of music don't realy care, Hard to fill space onthis one"
4,New Wavey Lover Boys,"I love me my Mike Reno of 1980 and that was the year the whole band Loverboy burst onto the scene and burst out of those leather pants with this debut album. As a child I had this tape and the follow up ""Get Lucky"" and for some reason it was always the second album I played more, because of its more rock sound but having matured and buying both releases on CD, I find myself gravitating to the debut so much more often.It's much more new wave rock than one would think of when they think of Loverboy and songs like ""Lovin' Every Minute Of It"" but this is truly a new wave melodic album with the hit singles ""Turn Me Loose"" and ""The Kid Is Hot Tonite"", it contains some of the best album tracks of the 80s."
3,Tight and energetic.,"I find this debut album from Loverboy to be respectable. It does sound a bit dated, but that doesn't take anything away from it. Loverboy has always been a pretty cool group with a straight-ahead sound. They are good musicians and songwriters--they surely left a mark on me. This first album is tight, energetic, and upbeat. It's not a real dark and depressing collection of songs. Mike Reno sings well on here--he's always had an instantly recognizable voice. The guitar and keyboard playing is cool too. My favorite songs are ""Turn Me Loose,"" ""Prissy Prissy,"" and ""It Don't Matter."" The only song I've never liked to listen to is ""Little Girl."" It just doesn't match up to the rest of the tunes. I still listen to this album from time to time. Loverboy has always been a band that I've had respect for. I've always liked the way they have blended guitars and keyboards in their music. This is an enjoyable album to listen to."
5,A hot new country trio!,"I listen to this album over and over again. The music is fresh and upbeat and the voices are great. ""I Want a Man"" will make you want to get up and dance, and the re-make of Sarah MacLachlan's ""Angel"" is better this time around. If you want an all around fun CD this one is for you!"
5,Love Lace's Sound!,"This is a wonderful debut cd! Lace has beautiful harmonies. They sound a lot better than the Chicks and the Spice Girls for sure. Thank you so much Sandra for introducing me to the awsome sound of Lace! Its like the Girls Next Door reencarnated, only there are three singers instead of four. Totally awsome! I've added Lace's cd to my list of favorates. Its definately a cd I'll listen to for years to come."
4,Great CD.,"This is a great CD not an awesome CD but a great one. They sing very good together. I bought this CD the day it came out at the record store. Which is rare for me. I only bought 4 CDs before this one on the day it came out. I Want A Man is a good song, not as good as Beverley's solo stuff especially the song Girl Out Of The Ordinary but this CD is better than alot of other CDs I have. Well worth spending money on them. Get it and try and get Beverley's debut CD Girl Out Of The Ordinary."
5,Muy Bueno este primer CD,"Este CD que cuenta con La Produccion de dos Grandes(Productores, Arreglistas y Compositores) del Pop y el R&B como lo son Humberto Gatica y David Foster, de alli el Calido Pop y R&B que invade este buen estilo Country de Lace. Las letras estan muy bien combinadas. Por todo eso Las Cinco Estrellas. Recomiendo Todo el CD en General."
1,It's been done better before..,"This album just does not have the fun of Shania or the sophistication and lyrical adeptness of the Dixie Chicks. It sounds like Lace is just trying to capitalize on the trend - the singing sounds rehearsed, even on ""I Want A Man."""
2,The Dixie Chicks - NOT,"Seems like there are a lot of country bands trying to ride the coat tails of the Dixie Chicks. This is one trio that should get off that ride. Songs are ordinary. Vocal talent average. Backup band nothing special. Granted these gals look nice, so their video might be worthwhile, but there are lots of other better quality albums out there to choose from. Sorry gals but you only get two stars from me."
2,Same ol' same ol',"I liked this album the first time I heard the Dixie Chicks perform it. It was even OK the second time I heard it performed by Shedaisy. Get it? This has all been done before. While the members of Lace are arguably more attractive than their counter-parts in these other bands, they aren't offering anything original musically."
5,Love this!!!,"I've tried everything under the sun to tame my dry damaged hair which usually feels like matted straw when wet. This stuff is amazing. The shampoo didn't matt my hair, lathered well and smelled nice. The conditioner is magic! My hair immediately smoothed out and felt softer. I was actually able to run my fingers thru my wet hair, previously impossible no matter what conditioner I tried. This stuff made comb out a breeze and now my hair is soft, shiny and silky. From straw to silk and at a very affordable price. I'm stocking up on this and I suggest anyone with damaged, frizzy, hard to manage hair give this a try."
4,Namur Rocks,Namur is an awesome band. Their sound if so different and refreashing. If you like Conquer me...get their other CD Cherb Dust. You can't get it off Amazon but you can import it by going to namur's website. www.namur.nu
3,Not a 'Must have',"Simply put, get Without The Aid Of A Safety Net before buying this one. That one is a must-have fan heirloom."
3,"Not bad, but disappointing","First off for those expecting to hear The Lost Patrol and The Storm, forget it. How they left these songs out is a WTF moment. Very good quality when playing on a PS3. But disappoiinting that it is it."
3,Humerous,"My negatives are: this is written totally from a mans' point of view and the section on singles is a bummer, not much practical advice on real estate purchase. I enjoyed the humor."
4,Funny slice of life SOB.,Funny review of the pitfalls that can befall you when moving to another country. Thought provoking and entertaining.I plan on moving to Mexico soon and I hope avoid most of the pitfalls he has pointed out.
4,The Renegade Guide is THE book to read before you move to Mexico.,"Don't go to Mexico before you read this book!Lots of needed information provided in a humorous manner. Mr. Adams provides needed insight into the culture of the Mexican people, because it is so important if you plan to live among them. Detailed info about all the legal issues, necessary paperwork, etc, is included with websites listed for those who have other questions. For every area of interest, there are websites and phone numbers listed. This makes his book timeless because information can be easily located, and that's why you buy a book like this - to find information that otherwise is very difficult to find."
1,Sexist and out of date information,"While there may be a few facts of interest or use in this book, for the most part anyone who has travelled in Mexico or done any research on moving there will probably already know most of the contents of this book. What bothered me most about it was the fact that the author is sexist, always addressing the reader as if he were male and not possibly a female ('you and the missus', 'sweet cheeks' referring to one's female mate, etc...). Also, much of the information is out-of-date (e.g. the author states that paying $600/month rent is far too much). If you buy this book, be prepared to wade through most of it in search of information relevant to you."
5,Can't believe I finally found it,"I've been looking for this album for yrs. I'm not much for christian music, But Acappella Southern is One by itself!! Love the music, there is not one Bad song on here. Thank you for having it, I would recomend this to any age!!!"
5,"The best Albeniz on guitar, ever","There is no better collection of Albeniz on guitar, and no better John Williams recording. Once you have heard his version of 'Granada,' no other recording in the usual key of E will suffice. He actually tuned his 5th string up from A to B -- suicide on your A string! -- to get a more resonate sound in his transcription. Williams's extrovert style works wonders with 'Cordoba' and 'Sevilla' as well. Given this classic mix of an extrovert guitarist and an extrovert composer, the closing rendition of the ""Tango is D"" is all the more magnificent. Never was Albeniz more reflective; never was Williams more reflective. Arguably the best guitar recording ever dedicated to a single composer, though a series of recent and brilliant recordings by David Russell (of Torroba, Barrios, etc.) make it hard to make such a blanket statement. Anyway: buy this recording!!!!!!!!!."
4,"Good Printed Version, Fair CD Version","This printed version differs from others by offering examples.The CD version installs itself onto hard disk therefore runswithout the CD in drive. The look-up function is a bit limitedcompared to Random House, American Heritage or Encarta. Eitherfound or not found, no suggested spelling.The examples are good.I am buying Short OED printed."
5,"outstanding dictionary of ""americanized"" english","This is an outstanding dictionary of American English. At 2,000 pages and over 350,000 definitions, the reader usually finds the answer to questions. The text size in some dictionaries is too small but it is large and bold enough to clearly see the succinct definitions, examples, word type. A few photos are provided that kept my interest. By purchasing this book, I was offered a 6 month access to the Oxford Dictionary web site. I spent about an hour playing on its pages. I fantasized that I'd obtain access to a digital form of the 20 volume philological history of words and meanings, but that was just my hope. This is an excellent dictionary for adults and some high school students. I think that a dictionary, periodically updated, is something we all ought to have. There are lots of products that focus on lanaguge, english-american, slang, politics, etc. I give this a solid ""A""."
2,Represented as including CD(not true),"While it is a nice dictionary, This was represented as including a CD version at the time of purchase(gold box deal)which would have been a nice deal. However it does not, it does include a rather worthless free online access to a dictionary look-up service for 6 months, great if you only planned on using it for 6 months there after it becomes a monthly subscription service. I am disappointed so back it goes"
2,Pages 1881-1928 missing,"I was looking up the word ""wack"" and my copy is missing pages. I have it laying out in front of me and I see page 1880 on the left hand side and page 1929 on the right hand side; From vibraphone at the bottom of the left hand page to window's weeds at the top of the right hand page. I'm tempted to check all the pages and see if others are missing. Are all copies missing these pages, or is mine a freak?"
1,prematurely published,"I've been using the Oxford American English dictionary (Kindle edition) for the past three months. This seems to have been written in haste. The editors or proofreaders didn't do enough research to release this dictionary. The staff at Oxford have proved their incompetence in this one. Oxford publications purport to be the last word on everything, but this edition is amateurish. If I were they, I would sell this edition for the remainder table, and go back to the drawing boards!"
1,CD-ROM does not install on WIN7/64 bits,"CD-ROM does not install on WIN7/64 bits.On CD-ROM there are two names:Oxford University Press 2001 and iFinger 2001.iFinger is a Norwegian company. On their website they say:CD-ROM-usersDoes iFinger provide support for cd-rom products?Cd-rom products have never been sold by iFinger LTD, hence iFinger does not provide support for cd-rom products.Can I upgrade my cd-rom product?Unfortunately Cd-rom products containing iFinger software are not upgradable. Cd-rom products consists of iFinger licensed software, and have never been sold by iFinger LTD.Are the cd-rom versions compatible with the download version?The CD-rom version is not compatible with the download version. Cd-rom products are no longer supported.I called Oxford University Press-USA phone 800-445-9714 and talked with Josh. He never heard about iFinger and does not have a solution."
2,.,This dictionary weighs a ton. For that reason I knew I would never use it so I returned it to you.
2,It sould be call the mattress,"They spend so much time of the film moving a mattress to one place to the other, it is a slow and dull film, dont bother, rent it if You really want to see it. only recomended for those who want to experiment asian films."
5,Rice people,"This film captures the true essence of what it means to be ""Rice People"" the poor people that live in the country sides of Cambodia. The Khmer metaphors used, language, sounds and colors give watchers a sense of actually being in the coutry sides to experience the joy and hardships of country folks in Cambodia.Any Cambodian people out there who want to see the other side of Cambodia rather than the city life should check out this film."
3,"Great title/Great actors-lousy print, low sound that goes up and down","Love the storyline! Amazing actors who do a marvelous job!! I believe in building a video library and this title should be in anyone's library if they love 30s & 40s film! However, this print is not good. I bought two of these titles because I thought the first dvd-r disc had something wrong with it. Nope, they are both the same. I have hundreds of dvd-r from this same supplier and yes, I have about 50 that have sound problems and out of those 50 about half of them have picture quality problems. I am speaking of titles from the 30s & 40s. These films that are not even up to TV quality are not restored prints that I am talking about. Not all films from this supplier are like this. I know what I am talking about because I have hundreds of dvd-r copy's from them. The point of this review is to say, great storyline, even better actors!!! You must have this title! But be forewarned this is more than lousy print. Such a shame."
3,"Great Film, Horrible Release","This film is a gem. James Whale may be known purely for his four horror films, but he also directed over a dozen films that were not horror. With this one being, in my humble opinion, the best of them. Unfortunately this DVD has no scene selection option, no extra features, and the picture quality is really sub par. The dvd is probably worth the purchase if its your only way of seeing the film, because it's really good."
3,Expected more.,"I bought these to replace my tiny, 5 year old, cheapo - $25 Zenith speakers that I bought at Odd Lots, which actually still worked and sounded pretty good. I searched and searched for ""outdoor speakers'. Must have read a million reviews. Finally I settled on the Yamahas because of the name.The Yamahas are twice the size, 6 times the cost, but unfortunately only marginally better. With a 6 "" woofer I expected much more base and the duo tweeters sound tinny.They only come in white (I really wanted black) and the instructions have a section on ""how to paint your speakers"". Seems weird.I gave them a 3, but perhaps a 3.5 is more accurate."
4,listen to it over and over and it still sounds good,i enjoy this cd ever time i listen to it. i recommend everyone purchase this. You will always enjoy it each time you listen to it.
3,HIt and Miss,"This book it part spy thriller and part inspirational biography. I found the adventure parts of the book interesting but biographical details much less so. While reading about author escaping from hitmen, I couldn't put the book down. However, while reading about the author meeting his second wife I could not wait for it to end."
2,1/5 Great; 4/5 Meh...,"A Train to Potevka was an interesting story about a CIA mission that was abruptly scrubbed when the mission was discovered by the Russians. The rest was 200 pages about his mother, son, LDS mission trips, eating at McDonald's, and other uninteresting fillers that made for a long book.Unfortunately, I think the really good parts are largely overshadowed by the extremely boring ones and I do not recommend reading it. For a non-fiction spy thriller that I could not put down and one of the most interesting books I've read, read A Time To Betray by Rheza Khalili."
5,great reading,"great reading, once I started reading it, I could not put it down.I would recomend this book to all ages."
2,1/2 spy novel,"I found the first half of the book a great spy novel, had dificulty putting it down. At about the mid point the author switched to a religous/family values book. The story was ruined for me. I tried to pick up the story again, but the suspense was destroyed. I was unable to finish the book."
1,A penny is over priced.,"I appreciate that the author served our country. The book seems to go nowhere, it drones on and on. I was given a signed copy of the book and I felt cheated. At a penny the book is over priced and your time is better spent doing something else. I thru my copy of the book away it was so bad."
1,TRULY AWFUL,Ramsdel is unqualified to write spy thrillers. Perhaps this is the reason that this junky book is self-published. He can't seem to make up his mind whether to write a spy thriller or to write a biography of his family so he gets the stories tangled together in a very non-cohesive way. His style gives very little hope that he will ever succeed as a writer.
1,A Train to Farfetchedka,"Readers of Mike Ramsdell's book A Train to Potevka are given a curiously worded disclaimer in the prologue. ""It would have been impossible to write this book,"" Ramsdell says, ""and not have the liberty to create dialogue, description, and detail in order to make the story more readable and enjoyable. Thus...several of the events, dates, places, and names in the book have been altered or fictionalized."" Altered, OK. But fictionalized? That would explain why this book does not have the faintest ring of truth to it, but it doesn't give Ramsdell justification for passing this story off as anything other than pure fiction. The book is a poorly written, simplistic tale that only the most gullible reader will believe."
4,A real page turner,I enjoyed this book. The author drew me into the story. I felt like I was on the train and in the safe house with him. I'll read it again.
5,A great read,"Yes, the book is a thriller with a ""cloak and dagger"" element to it. However, I enjoyed the other stories that were intermingled in the story line. I especially enjoyed Mr. Ramsdell's rendition of the Thanksgiving in Potevka.In the end, this is a book that will uplift the reader. It is a reminder to me of Anne Frank's assertion that people are basically good. I am looking forward to ""the rest of the story"""
4,A Great Story,This is a great tale about love and adventure. It is also insightful to the nature of man and his relationship with others. Mike Ramsdell has created a vivid tale of his years spent in the former USSR. I loved this book.
4,A good read....,"My daughter's book group read this book and she passed it on to me. I found the story very interesting and I had a hard time putting it down for two days. Although he is a first-time author, and you can tell, I found myself drawn into the story so much that I could feel the cold of the Russian winter. I wouldn't classify it as a ""spy thriller"" but more as a memoir of a significant experience in the author's life complete with his feelings and reflections during the time of the story. I did like the background information on Russia interspersed throughout the book. I also wonder how the box got there and although it seems far-fetched, stranger things have happened. Thanks for a good read. Are you going to tell us what happened to Sasha?"
4,Incredible Story,"This was a really fun book. This book reminded me how the lives of people can be an influence and an inspiration to others. Mike's life is remarkable but I'm sure if I had met him in passing I would have assumed his was a ""normal"" guy. This proves to me again that everyone's life is interesting and everyone has precious jewels to share with society!"
5,A Train to Potevka by Mike Ramsdell,Great book of intrigue and faith - not the usual connection! The Russian history was interesting and the miracles wrought continue to inspire.
4,An unpretentious exposition of truth,"Mike Ramsdell's first book is written from the heart. I bought his book on a whim and I was glad I did. It is nice to read a story that discusses doubt and faith and the good of humanity in a cruel world, instead of all the ugly, cynical garbage that is so popular today. It is a good read."
1,Easily the worst book I've ever read,"Really? I cannot believe that I actually finished this thing. There has to be vanity publishing that's more polished than this thing. At the point where we got page after page of what a thrill it was to eat at McDonald's I began to wonder if this was a joke and I was just missing it. Nope- there is no irony here at all- it really is that bad. However, if you have the kind of taste that thinks McDonald's is fine dining, then this is probably the literature for you. Enjoy."
4,Harmonies of life,"This disc will become a favorite of any musicologists collection. The tonal stirrings of Isaac Stern complemented by the technical range of Itzhak Perlman and the expressive bowing of Pinchas Zukerman make for a truly stunning ""live"" performance. These are works well-known to the performers and orchestra alike with a complete understanding of tempo and tonal fluctuation throughout each work. I only wish this disc could have been originally recorded with modern technologies to exemplify the true mastery displayed by these virtuosi."
5,Superlative Performance,"I have owned this recording since it was issued and it has given me many hours of pleasure. The collaboration is breathtaking,with Perlman, Stern & Zukerman in top form with outstanding accompaniment from the New York Philharmonic. Heartily recommended!!!"
4,Bag Review,"I love the bag, it is adorable! Smaller than what I thought but I still use it for a school bag. I have gotten alot of compliments on it."
5,Was worth every pennies..,"I love this Brand of model so much that I bought 2 more Donk. This one i liked better than the Revell 1:24 '87 Buick Grand National that is (Purple car). It has more chrome and it give you choices of tired.(extra tire)They really do look awesome, detail is great. You even get a fire extinguisher to paint lol.. I haven't open the Revell 1:24 '86 Chevy Monte Carlo SS 2 'n 1 yet (red w/checker)I'll give you the detail in the future.. One last thing. AGE DON'T MEAN NOTHING WHEN IT COME TO BUILDING MODEL. I'M 45 AND IF U GO TO U-TUBE FOR EXTRA HELP AND TIP U SEE OLDER PPL THAN ME. SO ENJOY AND LIVE.."
2,"Mussorgsky's ""Pictures""","Although I'm happy to have the music, I'm a little disappointed with the quality of the re-mastered CD. The newer recordings have so much more depth. I'll choose more carefully next time."
3,Last movement of Pictures conducted too slow,"Hello,I feel that Bernstein conducted the last movement of Pictures too slowly. It has a majesty and grace all it's own but in Bernstein's hands it slows to a jaunted crawl and looses some of the awe effect. Also the percussion is ever so slightly too loud in the end. I don't thing the tubular bells or gong were meant to be heard as much felt. Kind of a let down, but there's another version I'm used to hearing that set me up for this. Not sure what version that is, but I'll let ya know if I find out. The rest of ""Pictures"" is decent, and ""Night"" is great.Phillip"
5,"Tracks not in correct order when downloaded, or played in cloud player.","Five stars for the recording. 0 stars for Amazon's delivery of the recording.If you download this as an MP3, or listen to it with the Amazon Cloud player, the tracks will be in the wrong order!!!They should be:1.

5,Powerful music!,I loved this CD. It is the same cover and everything as the record we had while I was growing up. In HS we actually marched to this! Wonderful memories and excellent recording.
4,Nice production of classic sound,I enjoy classical music and this is one of the best produced and directed by the best. Totally great value.
1,WARNING TO ALL!!,"this cd player is EXTREMELY difficult to open to put a cd into it. i cannot even use my unit. it worked once and that was it. no clear cut ""open"" button to open the lid."
5,Breakbeat at its best!,This breakbeat album is easily in my top ten favorites. A classic that has yet to show flaws in the genre and still entertains to this day! A MUST have from B-boys!
5,This CD is Hip-hop at its best!,The Freestylers have done an *EXCELLENT* job of keeping the spirit of traditional hip-hip alive as well as adding some new flavors to their sound. Artists today simply don't make great music like this anymore. This is a must have for any hip-hop fans out there!
5,Great!,"This cd is incredible, one of the best cds I have ever bought. B-boy stance and break beats part 1 are probably two of the best songs i have heard in a long time. Definetly a more than worthy buy for anyone."
4,Nothing complex...just fun,Amazon's tracklisting seems wrong here. There is nothing complex or deep about this album....but I listen to frequently....it's totally rowdy and fun. My favorites are Ruffneck and Hold Up Your Hands.
1,jock jams,"the freestylers rip off some excellent styles. and do a really bad job.if you want to hear the real thing, i would suggest listening to POOR RIGHTEOUS TEACHERS Holy Intellect"
3,"""Here we Go"" on a ride to one-hit-wonderland","After buying the Freestylers CD ""We Rock Hard"", I must say that after the catchy hit, ""Here we Go"", I was so disapointed over what I found on the CD. The tracks are so overly mixed and the lyrics so hard to understand, most of them lacking the upbeat and energetic feel of ""Here we Go"", the rest of the CD is a let down to say the least. I wish I could get my Money back now, because this album is not spending much time in my CD player."
1,We really suck!,Unfortunatly I own this album and it is the worst thing I have ever heard. The songs are cheezy and get boring after one minute. Buy this album if you have a few dollars that you would otherwise burn.
5,Apocalypse Burning: The Earth's Last Days,"Part three of this Apocalypse series picks up where the last leaves off, jumping right into the action. The world is still seeking answers, and only a few have found them and are trying to get the message out. Action packed and a must read."
1,Not that bad...,"This book was recommended to me by an evangelical friend, and at first I dismissed it as one of his occassional attempts to convert me. But I'm a sucker for military fiction, so I gave it a try.The result? Not impressed. The book promises ""technical accuracy"", and you get that in spades, though I'm quite sure why we need to know that the M4A1 is indeed four inches shorter than the M16. In fact, there was quite a lot of unnecessary technical detail. The Simonov SKS is chamberef in 7.62, but why do we need to know that?I found the whole book very turgid and lifeless, and it seemed to me like yet another ""LB"" cash grab. As for the story itself, well, I follow Fred Clark, so I read this story with a cynical eye. It had me laughing at the utter absurdity of it all at several points."
1,Mediocre to unoriginal.,"Alright, assembly-line fiction is one thing. Nobody expects an original plot out of Odom, given how his story is inevitably going to chug along the prophecised tracks laid down in the Left Behind books. However, he ought to at least make an effort at invention, else he might set an example for a generation of lazy hacks. I mean, the lead couple is named ""Goose"" and ""Meg""? What, Odom kicked a couple brewskis and happened to be watching ""Top Gun"" while he cranked out this drivel? Gimme a break."
3,DVD TV series order,I ordered the TV series Hearts Afire recently. It arrived promptly and I was surprised at how fast my order arrived.
1,Don't Bother!,"This is the story of a woman who is a widow, who raised 2 children on her own and later married a man that she had briefly known in highschool. It still is not clear why she married this man, stayed married to him or quite frankly why he stayed married to her. On their wedding night he tries to kiss her for the first time (not counting the quick wedding kiss) and she turns her face away from him, at which point he ""forces"" himself on her. After 2 or 3 such episodes she decides she's in love with this man she can't seem to stand and barely seems to tolerate his attentions. A more cold fish I've never read about. I take that back that would be her husband, maybe they did deserve each other but you don't. Save your money read something else!"
5,Gift,I purchased this for a gift. My friend that received it just Luv's her new book and says that it well worth owning.
4,Great for beginners,Great book for all pasta lovers - especially ones who are still inexperienced. Interesting fact from pasta history are fantastic.
3,Dissapointed,"My sister-in-law gave me a hand crank pasta machine lately and since I had never made pasta before I purchased this book. The rave reviews gave me the impression that I would be able to learn about pasta, how to make pasta, the techniques of making pasta etc...and I was very dissapointed. The book had more recipes in it than it did information about pasta, and the recipes dont even look that great. I made raviolli from the book tonight, first time using the book, and first time making home made pasta, and honestly, had the book provided more information about actually MAKING pasta then I might be more satisfied. I havent found anything better than this book as of yet, but I am incredibly dissapointed. My reccomendation is if your looking for recipes and a brief history about pasta, then this book is great, if your trying to learn how to make pasta, pasta basics, techniques etc...then keep looking."
4,Beautiful Coffee Table Book but Missing Some Essentials,"I bought the book to learn about the basics of making home made pasta for the first time on a hand crank pasta machine but I found the book to be slim on technical information like how to use a hand crank machine and any tips and tricks. It didn't even tell me how many times to run the pasta sheets through the machine at which settings - which most recipes don't either which creates confusion. Therefore, this beautiful book is more like a museum of pasta rather than a manual for users. The recipes included might prove to be useful but weren't super unusual at first glance. I regret not buying the Cook's Illustrated Pasta book instead - I have a hunch it would have gone through the steps of actually using the machine point by point. But I fell for the color pictures in this book. I don't regret buying it but buyer beware."
4,Essential Pharoah,"A gem because it is mostly live, recorded at a defunct club in L.A. for unconventional styles. You must accept that at any moment P. Sanders can go from serene to surreal. If you can hold on, he'll bring it full circle. A good introduction or addition to a fan."
4,The purchase was good but was a gift,"I can't apreciate the product plainly for it was a gift, but I know that it was liked very much"
5,"I love it. Maybe you will, too, but probably not.","Although the previous reviewer's technical criticisms are mostly correct, it turns out that this is a good thing. And not because I'm laughing at the author - I think that he's rather clever, and subtle. Unfortunately, I don't see how to further describe the virtues of the book without ruining the experience of reading it for the first time. I absolutely love it, but I realize that not everyone will feel this way. For this reason, rather than recommend it to my friends, I have bought three or four copies to give as gifts. One person loved it, too. Others were puzzled as to why I chose it, and one person seemed to be weighing the possibility of avoiding me in the future.So, I recommend it to everyone."
2,"Not the best, not the worst.","I picked up this book in the Barnes and Noble discount bin a few weeks ago. Seeing as how I am currently living in Chicago, I thought it would be a rather interesting read.Well, I was partially correct.First off - for readers that abhor poor editing, don't buy this book. It is self-published and has had little to no editing whatsoever. Reading this book was quite painful, from the misplaced punctuation marks to the unfortunate misspellings. The lack of editing made it difficult to want to continue reading.That aside, the stories are lackluster at best. You'd find better confessions on some of the HBO shows of the same topic. While I'm sure the author's experiences were quite a study in human relations, he fails to effectively communicate the humor or interest in some of the tales he tells.All in all, I wouldn't consider the book a complete waste of my time, but I don't think I'd choose to read it again."
5,Sometimes We Meet Someone We Don't Like Twice,"Psychologist Michael Stone is being challenged by a man she had studied to learn about deviant personality when he was in prison. He is unexpectedly released and Stone's world is starting to turn upside down. From suspecting that her office is bugged to a number of other diabolical efforts to get under Michael Stone's skin, this taut mystery is totally engaging. This is an easy one to read from cover to cover in one sitting."
3,pleasant but underdone,"The writing is interesting, but the book should have had more depth. It's very predictable. What did i like? I liked the writing, I like the client stories, I'd like to see more of the character with a story that is less like a short story. Also, some of Michael's characteristics (like here pathological aversion to help from her friends) is annoying and makes you think she needs analysis more than her clients."
3,Disposable Brain Candy!,"I devoured this book, reading it in its entirety in less than 24 hours. I wouldn't, however, make the mistake of saying that it was a masterpiece or even anything near that. Salter tells the tale of Dr. Michael Stone (for the first 50 something pages I thought this was a man, it's not!) a psychologist who's faced with one of her worst enemies, child molester Alex Willy, being released from prison and beginning to stalk her. Though the novel never lives up to its potential and Dr. Stone has some annoying quirks (a love of b-ball, her term for basketball being not the least of these) it's still a fun summer read."
3,Not as good as the earlier albums,"The album is still quite good, but does not live up to Ledbetter Heights or Trouble Is. The acid test is that I compile best of tracks on disk in mp3 format and then cut cds of 160+ tracks and 15 hours of music but failed to include much from this album. Definitely heads into the rock side of music much more than the previous albums. The band is tight, the guitar and vocals are good but the sound is a bit too polished and mostly fails to move me to great heights."
4,KWS does it again!!: And it's great,"Kenny and the gang are back with a hard-hitting combo of blues rock and jazzy riffs with ""Live On"". This album shows more of Kenny's southern rock influence with some great guests!!"
5,Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band,"If you're a fan of guitar music, especially electric guitar, this album is a must-have.Kenny's guitar playing is hautingly similar to Stevie Ray Vaughn's and the vocals are a perfect match for the bluesy sound. The sound is very professional, but not sterile like a lot of studio recordings, it has a very ""live"" feel.This album features a remake of the Jimi Hedrix tune Changes (named Them Changes on this album) off the Band of Gypsys album. I was skeptical at first, but man it rocks!If you are a fan of the blues you must buy this album!"
4,more good ol' smokin licks,"Kenny Wayne Shepherd has truly earned his spot in the blues world as a player and songsmith. HOT HOT playing, and slamming riffs make Shepherd shine on this record... let's see more Kenny, but let's move away from Albert King and SRV licks - start melding your own blues.... then you'd have something revolutionary and 5 starred."
3,KWS is not there yet,"My initial impression of this disc is that KWS needs to learn the value of subtlety. Sometimes it sounds like a wall of sound. His first disc (Ledbetter Heights) sounded to me like he had a lot of stuff he needed to get out RIGHT NOW. It had a lot of tasty licks in it as well as volume. The second one (Trouble Is...) sounded like he was hitting his stride. This disc sounded like he sort of mailed it in. There's just too many needless overdubs that sound like they're there just to fill up space. I've seen him live and he doesn't need overdubs. He can fill up more than enough space by himself without overdubs. BTW, Noah Hunt can flat out sing. That boy just wails in concert. All this being said, I would rather listen to this disc than almost anything else out there. It's probably as much my problem looking for perfection in KWS and not finding it. This guy has so much talent and someday soon he will make the perfect kick ass blues record."
5,From blues to rock and somewhere in between,"I want to get down on this guy because he is too young and cocky but I just can not do anything but love him. I have seen him perform live and somehow you get the feeling that Shepherd and Hunt came from a gang some place that use to beat up weaker kids, you know the type. But this gang can play in the band. Go ahead curl up the corner of your lip when you first meet him, but you damn well better listen to what comes out of the openings because it is the potent stuff that can very well snap your spine from rocking back and forth or hurt your hands and feet from slapping and stomping. Let there be no mistake about it, these kids came to rock...this is not the blues here per se....it may be something in between but not since the Black Crows will you hear better in this recent history. Buy this and turn it up!"
5,ZZ Top Meets SRV,"The guy rocks. His crunchy sound is absolutely champion. In 2 Deep is like a rockier ZZ Top, while his vocalist is quasi-SRV. Interesting combo. If you like ZZ Top, this is a good pick. If you lean more towards the bluesier sounding style, maybe it's not great. The dude is no guitar master, but man- he can lay a killer, cruchin' tune. I appreciate the CD for taking two styles that are similar and mixing them, while adding in a harder sound to top it off. It's good, and in my opinion creative stuff."
2,Just a beginner...,"Just listen to Johnny Winter or Eric Sardinas and you understand that KWS has a long way ahead if he wants to be a real blues guitar hero... This effort is not bad, but these licks have already been played thousands of times before by SRV."
1,A Sad attempt to play the blues,"This CD is a disgrace to the legandary blues singers of the past such as Ruth Brown, BB King, Buddy Guy, and John Lee Hooker. The fact that people buy this trash and call Kenny a legend is a disgrace. Every song on this cd lacks any feeling or ""blues."" Jonny Lang, Kenny's pier is a much better performer and his music has more substance. I suggest that all blues fans check Jonny Lang out and leave Kenny's trash right where it belongs, on the shelf collecting dust."
3,Not as bluesy as his earlier albums.,"I am a huge fan of Kenny Wayne Shepherd. But I was disappointed in ""Live On."" It's more hard rock than blues. Naturally, it's all a matter of personal taste. If you like more of a hard sound, you may like this. But it's quite a departure from his earlier work."
3,not soo good!,"This album and the one before ""Trouble is"" is really way lower in standard when compared to his first one LEDBETTER HEIGHTS. LEDBETTER HEIGHTS was solid blues rock but these last 2 ones are more like heavy rock with a very slight taste of blues. Especially this one LIVE ON the heavy distortion on almost all tracks make it sound like a heavy metal group throwing in sum slide guitar in..not so good for the BLUES purist. It might howewer interest the rock fan who wants sum blues solos thrown in between verses of heavy distorted guitar. Anyone agree?"
3,A respectable followup to Trouble Is...,"Kenny Wayne's Hendrix and SRV influences are as apparent as ever. Noah Hunt's vocals work well with the guitar lines. Covers of Buddy Miles' 'Them Changes"" and Peter Green's ""Oh Well"" are fun listening. Still, I don't hear four stars here. If you're looking for an uncanny guitar solo like ""Blue On Black"" it's not on this CD, so pick up Dave Hole's recent release Under the Spell instead."
4,This Is AWESOME,I have only hear 2 things as good as this and those were his other cds. Its a work of art. I would recommened this to anyone who likes good music. i loved it and i think you will too.
3,DECENT EFFORT,"When you purchase recordings by musicians such as Taj Mahal, Eric Bibb, Keb Mo, BB King, John Lee Hooker, Luther Allison, Jonny Lang etc. you expect that the musician is both the lead singer as well as one of the musicians. I suppose that is the reason that Amazon.com erroneously concludeds that KWS is the vocalist on this as well as his two earlier recordings. Not so, what you get here is some solid guitar playing by KWS and some grunge vocals from an overweight greasy biker looking singer by the name of Noah Hunt. Hunt replaced Corey Sterling, a more soulful blues singer, after the Ledbetter Heights CD. I have seen KWS in concert both with G3 as well as his own band. There is no questioning his ability on the guitar. I do, however, question the need for Mr. Hunt. Mr. Hunt's antics on the stage are distracting. Fortunately, when you only have to listen to him, he is not that bad."
1,Good but not great,"I got this CD this past weekend and listened to it for a couple of days on and off and nothing really grabbed me. To me most of the songs sounded like songs from his last CD. There were a couple of songs that were catchy but ironically they are cover songs. KWS is a great guitar player and puts on a great show live, but his CD's just don't do anything for me."
5,silver jewelry harp earring holder,"Very happy with the product, just what I wanted and I received it in a timely manner. Very solid item."
4,Great way to display your earrings,"I really love this stand. It's sturdy and looks nice. My only complaint would be I wish the spacing between rows was wider. I'm not using half the rows because my earrings hang over from the row above. Still, great price, fast shipping, excellent product."
4,Great product,"Works really well for most of my earrings. Holes may not work well if you have large posts, but you can hook them over the bar itself if you need to. Pay attention to the product dimensions. The picture makes it seem smaller than it is."
1,Broken,"Yes, I received the holder in two pieces. It was broken, the holder from the base. Luckily my husband is a welder and was able to tact it back together. It is a nice product but the shipping department placed it in a envelope instead of a box, so it didn't have a chance to come in one piece. When you pay for shipping/handling you expect it to come in one piece. Please take another look at your shipping method."
2,Poor Construction,"This item was poorly constructed, damaged during shipping or both. Had the item cost half as much, I would have expected this. For an item that will cost over $20.00 by the time it's shipped to you, and only consist of a few wires and metal bands, the least you could expect is an appearance that it was put together carefully. The large wire scroll like frame appears racked and thus makes the metal bands all look bent. Painted finish was so thin that it was already rubbed through in several places when we received the item. It will do the job but should have cost much less for the quality."
2,"Cool design, but scratches and chip marks all over","this was supposed to be new, not used. but when this arrived in the box, the silver was chipped in 3-4 places and there are scratches on it right out of the box!! it looks like i have had it for years with the wear and tear on it the way it arrived.the design is nice, and i would like to keep it. but the coating is so poor that it looks too tacky to display with all the chip marks."
3,Good solid product,"Good solid product, colour is great, only potential issues are that it has a bit of an industrial look to it (you can see the welding on the sides etc.) which is not necessarily bad, its just a specific look that may or may not work with your taste. Also the space between the various rows is too small if you want to use this for dangly earnings.I would give it a 4 for my taste and needs, but I gave it a 3 knowing that for most people the above issues are probably important"
5,"Unbelievable value, design and durability","What an amazing holder for earrings. Well crafted, strong and attractive. This is my pick of the season for great gifts...I love this earring tree."
4,Great Item,This is a great item with a tasteful design. It seems sturdy. I highly recommend it. Bought it for my girlfriend and it cleans up her mess of earrings well and conveniently.
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for to store my earrings. It is great to be able to see my earrings without have to dig through a jewelry box. The stand arrived in perfect condition. Its true that there is little packaging but I like that there was less waste.
4,A Frame for Artwork,"My wife loves it. It is really quite simple, but works well to hold the earrings. The earrings are really put on display and it's much nicer than having them sitting in a box."
3,EARRING HOLDER,I bought this for a tweenager. It is much larger than I expected. I would like to have seen a little smaller version. construction is OK... Patina appears a bit marginal.
5,Unbeatable earring organizer!,Best I've ever found...no more stuck-to-the-wall organizer preventing me from having easy access to the back! Finally I can move the earring organizer rack where I please and how I please. How wonderful!
1,Damaged,Looks like it might be a good product but the base was broken off when we opened it up. Received it with the base broken off during shipment. I'm the second one to receive it this way so buyer beware that the stand is fragile.
5,"Beautiful, functional - LOVE THIS JEWELRY HOLDER","I bought this holder for my 10 year old daughter to organize her many earrings and other jewelry and what a difference it has made! Her bathroom looks so neat and organized and the brushed silver holder is a beautiful and elegant addition to the room. It was very reasonably priced, arrived right on time and was a perfect gift. Thank you!"
1,not as advertised,You are not buying 25 hooves as the details state. You are buying 1 chew hoof. Had no problems with company refunding me the price i payed and they also sent me another hoof free of charge.
2,Poor execution of an interesting concept,"Sable Island is undoubtably a fascinating subject, and so it must take an exceptional talent to write such a uniformly dull book about it. I bought this book on a whim hoping it would live up to the mild acclaim paraded on the cover, but I've had to force myself to finish it over the last few days. The previous reviewer is spot-on regarding the topics covered, but he fails to mention that De Villiers managed to leach almost every ounce of interest from them. The only spark of vitality comes from other writers who De Villiers quotes extensively and to his own detriment. The book also lacks any sense of organization and I found myself repeatedly puzzled over how the chapters, not to mention the contents of the chapters, were supposed to be tied together."
3,picture worth a thousand words,"I haven't started to read it yet, looks full of fascinating info. But was disappointed there were no photos of such a unique and breathtaking place."
1,Just another Seminar,"I believe that the owner of the DVD should place the word, ""SEMINAR"" on the front & back of the DVD case. The reasoning is that the DVD is a video of a seminar that was held in a hotel conference room. The powerpoint slides should have been presented in a better format because the video screen is being videoed & the powerpoint slides cannot be read properly. There aren't any details that show a concrete methodology to predicting & profiting in the market cycle. I expected an educational, so that I can use the standards for profitting in the stock market."
2,Works pretty good,I have used two large buckets of this product in my fish pond which is about 12 x 24 feet x 3 feet deep to control algae. It works briefly but the algae comes right back due to the fish and direct sunlight exposure. I recently installed a UV clarifier that it is working very well to control algae. Highly recommend that approach over fish control or chemicals.
1,Horrible,"This movie is horrible. The acting and writing are horrible and the plot seems very scattered. I wonder how much these people are paid to be in movies like this or do they volunteer, or perhaps they have to pay for screen time. It seems like an extended acting school or community college movie. I take that back I have seen better community college production than this.The lead actor and actress are horrible, maybe they should try a reality show, or music video their acting is perfect for those formats."
1,should'nt buy it.,"terrible movie,robin givens barely appears. bad acting, terrible dialouge, not a play as advertised, instead a very, very, low budget film."
5,A must read for anyone who likes the X-Files.,"This book was a wonderful find. I can't wait for the next installment of the series. I couldn't put the book down. I bought it to read on the plane for a trip to Las Vegas, but I spent almnost the entire vacation with my eyes glued to the book, instead of the sights around me, and in Vegas, that says alot."
2,"Fair, interesting misfire","While some of the material printed here mentions similarities to The X-Files (and sorry, Chet, there are some interesting parallels), what weakens this novel is some shoddy character development and an overbaked plot that tries to throw in everything but the kitchen sink. There are some good ideas here, but they get lost in the muddle.If you really want to read n interesting horror/suspemse novel. try Neil gaiman's Neverwhere."
2,Sorry Chet....,"While some of the material printed here mentions similarities to The X-Files (and sorry, Chet, there are some interesting parallels), what weakens this novel is some shoddy character development and an overbaked plot that tries to throw in everything but the kitchen sink. There are some good ideas here, but they get lost in the muddle.If you really want to read n interesting horror/suspemse novel. try Neil gaiman's Neverwhere."
3,Kids Love the Box,"My boys loved their new lunchboxes. However, we all had difficulty with the insulated drink holders. The lids were not as easy to close as a ""thermos"" type drink holder. Other than that, we have no problem with lunchbox."
1,This book is NOT for most people......,"I ordered and returned this. My son is a high school senior and looking to get into MIT or another selective school. There is nothing in this book to help him do that. So if your child is past elementary school, there is nothing in this book that is unique. If your child is very young, and you are affluent parents, then the book might be of help to you."
5,Love this Body Wash,I love this sugar body wash. There are a number of different variations but the vanilla sugar is my favorite.
4,classic outfield,"I too ounce enyoyed the outfield and i have to admitt there return to rock is well worth the wait.Ounce the cd gets to track 9 give it all you got it losses it mometum but untill then it ia great from love affair, to there she goes again ,to a long walk on the beach this cd is a classis outfield cd,well written and played.I hope this review was helpfull to you"
3,Get the on-line version,"This version cuts my favorite new song from The Outfield, ""Same Old Story."" It's time to move on to all new material. I want this band to rock! I know they can do it. I will wait! I'm still waiting for a DVD video compilation or concert performance. robertch@gay.com"
4,yay!!!,Although these blades were not as sharp as i hoped they would be they cut well enough. Thanks!!! good job.
3,Baggallini wow,"However, I did not keep this bag, since my cellphone didn't fit in it.I know that I like the Baggallini's because I have one when I had my other cell phone. I am not a woman that likes to carry a pocketbook, so these bags are awesome...They need to make one that fits a LG Voyager phone!"
1,"Baggallini, what happened?!","Run, don't walk away from this item.I recently had my cell phone/purse stolen, it was one that I had for several years but it still looked good. So, I ordered the newer cell phone/purse. Man, was I disappointed.I gues that baggallini, being designed by flight attendants, has gone the way of traveling by air- too small and cramped."
5,Necessary Foundational Information,"It is true. Not too many Americans are aware that the Founding Fathers called the Articles of Confederation of 1781 our, ""first Federal Consti-tution."" Mr. Jensen points out that they were the written expression of the political philosophy of the Declaration of Independence. If one understands the concept of local state sovereignty (or independence) as expressed in the Articles, then they will have a much better understanding of the argument between the Federal Government and the Confederate Government (1861-1865)which was only a continuation of the long argument over the nature of the Union of American States. (And, as one reviewer points out, it is an on going argument until this day.) All in all, it is an excellent read; and very pertinent information."
5,Chilled tunes for a lazy sunday,"This CD is amazingly smooth. You can just sit there on a Sunday in your dressing gown, eating a beatiful fresh breakfast of pankakes and fruit and listen to this cd in the background. It provides the perfect canvass for a dinner party with style or for a romantic night with that special someone.Every guy (and girl) should have it in their collection for those SPECIAL times.:)"
4,Debut from underrated band,"I'm mostly writing this review to dispute the only other review on this album. While DMC's debut dabbles in New Wave territory, there's much more bouncy power-pop to be found. From the loose, earthy acoustic jams of ""Everything"" and ""Sing Hallelujah"" to the light pop-punk of ""Need A Love"" and ""All Good Generals"" this is a well-rounded snapshot of early '90s SoCal Christian Rock. The lyrics are evangelical without being preachy and YES, the lead singer Davia Vallesillo is a beautiful girl. She also stayed with the band for at least the next release, the more developed ""Welcome Race Fans"". Having seen Dakoda Motor Company play live more than once I can say that it's a shame more people didn't know about them. I guess it only costs a quarter to enlighten yourself. It would be well-spent."
3,Old school,"I used to own this on cassette when it came out and loved it. Thought I would give it a try once again. Not as good as I remembered but I do love the song ""wasteland"". Not a bad CD."
5,Great In Wall Speakers,"These Yamaha In-Wall speakers offer a ton of features and sound great. Based on Price, Quality, Features, and Ease of Install, you get the most bang for your buck with these speakers. They have a dB adjustment for mid & high tones right on the speaker. They offer multiple wire connection options, and are simple to install. They sound great with my entertainment system, and look great in the wall. They can be painted to match your wall color, which is another nice feature. I looked at and reviewed low, mid and high end speakers when looking to upgrade, these Yamaha speakers give you high end features, options, and sound quality for a very reasonable price. From what I found, they are the best deal out there!"
5,Nice Speakers for the Price!,"Installed these speakers without too much issue. The only thing I would recommend is to make sure to cut on the outside of the line that you trace from the template. I had to adjust the first hole that I cut for the speaker a few times to get it to fit. The second one was no problem (learning curve). The sound is great and there is just enough bass. I have a separate sub-woofer so I did not want too much bass. Overall these are great speakers. Also, if you plan on painting the grills it is best to spray them. I used a little spray kit I purchased at a hardware store called a Preval Paint Sprayer. Cost about $7. Worked pretty good."
5,Alarm Siren 115 dB,"Excellent product, made well and wired up as an extension to our existing alarm which added two siren's to our home. It is loud and does the job that I wanted. I would recommend this product to someone to use in their alarm system."
2,not loud,actually sounds sick didn't try to return it it's mounted and needed so I'll just live with it. Maybe I'll find a good loud one later on.
2,Not as load as I thought,"Makes all the noises they said it would, however, not the best or loudest quality sound."
1,Terrible purchase and returned,Received this item and the box was opened. The merchandise did not work. Terrible purchase and Amazon should be ashamed for sending defective products to good customers like myself. I am deeply disappointed in Amazon.
2,Garden Bird Fountain,This fountain is attractive and over all functions well for the price...Only negative is that it is not very sturdy in it's construction...It is made of some form of molded foam which will break or crack if tipped over or struck...
5,Great Purchase,"Movie was recieved as promised. The comdition of the CD was as described, and played perfectly. Would definately buy from this dealer again."
5,Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing & Charm School,"Excellent cast and really neat story, real sleeper you have to watch it closely or you'll get lost in the story. Great chick flick, but as a guy I really liked it. Bought it for my wife who loves it! Light hearted romatic movie, fast paced. Not mushy. If you liked ""Return to Me"" you'll love this."
4,Marilyn can't join us...,"A wonderfully light romantic comedy with a stellar cast. I enjoy the double storyline that takes place throughout the film. This would generally be a chick flick, but the boyfriend enjoyed it too."
5,Love this Movie!,"This dvd came in, in perfectly new condition, just as promised and arrived incredibly fast, much to my pleasant surprise! It's a wonderful movie. I highly recommend it."
1,This is the worst dance movie ever filmed.,"Don't get this movie expecting to see any good dancing. Even the supposed dance teacher can't dance. Rather, she dances as if she had at most 1 or 2 lessons. In the opening dance scene, where she is supposedly teaching the main character ""Lindy Hop,"" she instead teaches East Coast Swing. . . and teaches an underarm turn as being ""the basic."" Such nonsense.So, if you are interested in watching beginners trying to dance, and can ignore that their characters are supposed to be actually able to dance, by all means, watch this movie. Otherwise, use the hours that you would have spent on this movie dancing yourself! It will be a much better use of your time."
4,"Great movie, great message!","I highly recommend this movie for those looking for some extra strength on living out Catholic values. However, it's a great movie regardless of age!"
4,Good,"This was a good movie, a little slow but it was historic. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Great service"
3,Depth of content excellent.,"I Enjoyed movie. For Of Gods and Men, it was somewhat hard to read the subtitles. Content xcellent. Gregorian chant great."
2,I didn't receive what I was promised.,"I thought I purchased Of Gods and Men (Two-Disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo). I only received the Blu-Ray and notthe DVD. I do not have equipment that will allow me to buy the Blue-Ray. I hoped to give both as a gift.I cannot do this now and am out of the money which I spent. I am disappointed. I'd like my money back, butam not sure where the receipt is. Can you help?"
5,Beautiful,This is the best film I have seen in a long long time. It is so well made and so moving. I could easily have believed it was a documentary the acting was so well done. Will be watching it again soon and I usually hate to watch the same film twice.
5,Best movie I have seen in a very long time,Other reviewers have noted the sensitivity with which the characters are handled. They are all truly human. I am impressed by the use of the order of the Mass to carry the story line. The monks have already given their lives to their fellow man and can do no other than to give their lives for their fellow man.
1,For people who only have time to exercise one leg...,"I guess the people who made this video were in so much of a hurry that they forget to exercise the other leg!! The pushups and other exercises are great, but I feel cheated when I buy a videotape and they neglect to exercise muscles on the opposing side of the body. The outer and inner thigh exercises for one half of the body are totally missing!! I even rewound the tape just to make sure I hadn't made a mistake. I guess they thought people would buy the tape because they figured they would get a whole body workout in only 29 minutes. That's not the case. I also can't stand the incessant and pointless laughter from the people in the background designed to make you think they're having a good time.There are newer AND older tapes that are better than this. I've bought much, much better older cheesy videos at yard sales."

5,"Cool, Cool Water","I love the scent of Cool Water by Davidoff for Women. It's sensual, intimate, does not overpower the senses, enters a room with me and leaves with me. I have to be fairly close to someone for them to say, ""God, you smell good!"" And that's the way I like it."
1,BEWARE TESTER RYT,THIS SO SUCKS THERES NO SPRAYER WHEN I RECIEVED THIS ORDER EVEN THE BOTTLE IS ALREADY HALF WAY MAKE SURE CALL THE SELLER 1ST B4 U BUY THIS AND BEWARE TO PERFUME EMPIRE??? DON'T BUY THEM AND IT SO RUDE THE SELLER ....(PS) his liar i response to all his e-mail but he dont want to provide me a postpaid label to send it back the item dont lie PERFUME EMPIRE BEWARE TO THIS SELLER ITS SO (RUDE)...period
1,WEAKASS album by a WEAKASS rapper.,"When I heard this album I thought that it was SORRY!!! Sure, Suga Suga is an aaight song but the rest is stupid. He's a wack rapper and he trys too hard to be tight like a Jay-z or a Fabolous. Don't buy this weak album by this weak rapper."
2,Read this before you buy.,"I got this album expecting the soulful, R&B-ish type of music found in Baby Bash's singles ""Suga Suga"" and ""Shorty Doowop."" Instead, I got an album cluttered with over 15 tracks of mediocre rap. How Baby Bash promotes himself is really misleading when it comes to what you get on his album.How he talks about smoking weed in every other song gets a bit annoying, too. I wouldn't recommend this."
1,Not an interesting album.,"His lyrics are pretty much just nonsense, absolutely pointless and boring, a lot of repetion. It's really aggravatin to have to listen to them. While many other artists don't have overly intelligent lyrics, here the beats are boring, too. Listen to ""Suga Suga"" and ""Baby Doowop"" - the same boring beats, these songs even sound the same. This whole album is pointless."
4,Excelentte,"I liked this album, lots of my type of ""songs"". Excelent for chillin'. Few ""clubtracks"" for the next album and Boom, full five stars."
1,"I can tell he smokes alot, cuz weed kills brain cells","Ok this album is Horrible,terrible,and a abomination of a rap album. Baby Baby has no buisness rapping, with his week voice, and mediocre lyrics. The album reeks of money invested poorly.Except for the radio songs, which had appeal because of the people singing on the hooks. I can tell baby bash smokes and the weed smoke has affected his vocal chords and his brain. Have you seen this guy perform? he always looks nervous!Give any body off the street a multi million dollar studio with Happy-p beats, 6 million dollars of promotion, pay the radio stations to play there music and they would sell gold too. Don't buy this album if you really like rap music. If your a dumb little girl who likes his image,but dosen't listen to the words of a song then buy it."
1,"Not to bash, but....","I did it to myself. I violated my 3 in 3 rule: If you don't here three songs, in three months off an album, don't bother. The only song worth hearing on the album is ""Suga Suga"""
3,good just for now........,"when i first heard this cd it was alright, is not that tight as i thought but still it is a good cd, even thought baby bash is half mexican half white, he was raised with his latino family and he has some skills for rapping, if he keep on doing like that, he could be one of the best latino rappers out there like Lil ROb, Mr. Shadow and other artist who still are struggling to get an important record deal."
1,One question...,"Why do people like the song Suga Suga? IT'S THE MOST STUPIDEST SONG I'VE EVER HEARD.""Suga suga,how'd you get so FLYYYYYY???"" I'm sorry,Baby Bash,but the 70's are over,and no one says (...) things like that anymore.And if this song sucks,what makes you think the others will be better?By the way,what kind of name for a CD is ""Smokin Nephew""??? ""OH NO,MY NEPHEW IS ON FIRE!! AHHHHHHHH!!!"" Stupid."
1,On the real,I think that this cd is not good it was not what i was exspecting to here. It has a few good songs but not really mostly all of the songs are bad and he has alot of no name rappers on here he really needs to step up his game on the next album if he comes out with one.
2,Buy the single!,Suga Suga is the sweetest song!!! The remix completly ruined it! Image of a Pimp and Feeling Me are nice too. The rest of the album is horrible.
1,He Stayed Around a While...,"What's up with all these rap/R&B; artists who release one really big song then two weeks later no one remembers them? Shows how disposable they are. And really people, saying ""stop hating, haters"" or ""haters be hating"" is not going to change anyones opinion on this album. But what amazes me is how artists like this, and Nelly, and Lil Jon, and all the other MTV-made rappers sell millions of records, yet everyone goes and acts like they hate their CDs. That's real cool. If you bought their CDs go ahead and let people know how stupid you are. You're the ones who are going to keep the mainstream like it is now.Whatever happened to real music?"
1,He lost his touch,"Being a fan of Baby Bash/Baby Beesh I couldnt wait to get the new album, Smokin Nephew. But I wish I had. This album sounds like Baby Bash is in love. No longer is her talking about the things in the last album, but just about every song is about a female. That and the fact that he keeps repeating a song that has appeared on 3 albums now, time to give it a rest. I was very disappointed in this album, and i think that true fans of Baby Bash will feel the same"
2,Limited Coverage,Seat Gloves are nice idea and are effective in heat protection and water resistance. However there are many limiting attributes of these seat 'panels' -- 1) Panel only covers seat and back but the sides are open; 2) There is a very strong rubber smell that I hope will disipate over time. 3) I ordered a blue and gray version but I received gray and black - not very attactive on tan car seats.
2,"Funny, but what's with the repeats?","Jeff Foxworthy's material is unquestionably hilarious... he manages to mimic the redneck world he's a part of, without ever losing any of its charm. This collection of previous material (primarily from ""You Might Be A Redneck If"" and ""Games Rednecks Play"")is entertaining, as always. It is also extremely misleadingly labelled, to an extent which would constitute fraud if I had paid a subtantial sum for this CD. Most of the ""tracks"" are single-joke segments of an extended routine, and half the material repeats from the song segments to the stand-up parts. Putting half the material on twice does not add up to a full length album (and, at about 45 minutes total running time, this ain't a full-length album anyhow). Next time, wait till there's enough new matieral to warrant a full release, rather than trying to soak fans."
3,Repeats itself too much,"The speaking is really funny. The songs are funny. However, too many of the songs are just the speaking (the same speaking) set to music. It would have been much better if they had left off the repeats"
2,deja vu,"Ummmm.... didn't I hear that joke before? Just one track ago? Foxworthy is hilarious and these truely are some of his greatest bits, but I only needed to hear them each once on this CD. Instead they give them to me set to music and then without the music. I gave this to my husband and we were both really disappointed."
5,"COME ON, THIS CLASSIC","Looks like I have to set it straight here to, don't people get it or even look at the booklet. These are tracks from YOU MIGHT BE A REDNECK IF, GAMES REDNECKS PLAY, TOTALLY COMMITTED, AND THE MUSIC ALBUM CRANK IT UP. That's why music is on here, come on people don't you read. Please get it straight, I just had to set that straight. So if you are looking for a review in full detail you will have to peep out some one else's, thanks."
3,Irish music,"If you like the Chieftains, you'll enjoy this. If you're not, it's a great way to ""introduce yourself"" to some great music !"
3,A weak entry,"Some of the early stuff is very good. The Haitian stuff,not. Didn't buy the hero's ineptitude in the big confrontation. He's been around, but doesn't act it. Hope for better."
3,Just what the titlel states- Road tests!,"All B&W compendium of road tests, primarily by European press, of the car over its 40 years span of history. Good overview of its development, but images not always very clear."
3,Good text for Christian clinicians,"While I do not agree with all of their theological impliations, this text is a useful reference for Christian therapists. I would recommend it."
3,Modern Psychopathologies: A Comprehensive Christian Appraisal,"This is one of those ""must have book"" if your studying Psychopathologies."
5,Beautiful book,This book sits proudly on our coffee table and is often admired. The photography is stunning and the explanations of the photos very interesting. I highly recommend the book.
5,"Different sound, still Skillet","I loved this CD.That said--Be aware that this is an older CD of Skillet. John Cooper's signature voice comes through clearly (or should I say raspy? You know his sound). There are some rock tones to it, but if you're expecting a blast of Skillet and Rock and Worship then you will be disappointed. This is a WORSHIP cd. They don't try to rock it out on here. This is quiet. This is live. And this is heartfelt. It is beautiful and amazing.Bottom line: This album is very well done and deserves good reviews, but it is a quieter tone than Skillet's other albums."
3,A young rock band,This sounds to me like a live ablum done by a young 'Skillet' with minimal production. But it is a great addition to your collection if you are a real Skillet fan.
2,melow,"this was a dissapointment for me. there are popular worship music as well as some new stuff. this is very melow and unlike most of their stuff. as a whole the album is diappointing, if you have to have everything by them then by all means get this album otherwise skip it and move on."
5,Baby Bash repping that Nor Cal,"This was a good cd by a talented artist. It's different from what people are used to hearing, but once you feel it, then it's all good. There was a couple of tracks that I had to skip over, but overall good cd. Dont sleep on track 15 The Chop feat A-Wax from the P-World. Let's Do It!Weeze Baby"
1,WHAT THA??,"this cd is completly garbage!! n we need simon from american idol hurr n he'll say da same thang!!! ""DONT BUY THIS ALBUM""!! ITS WACK N HE CANT RHYME N I RECOMMEND PETEY PABLO OR SOMEHTING.... BETTA DEN DIS!"
5,A Multi-Facetious Spiritual Quest,"If you seek purely conventional poetry like that of Marlowe, Eliot, or, perhaps, Raleigh, do not read this book. It is far removed from the sphere of convention, as we know it. This book -- while it holds elements of an intellectual odyssey -- grafts an emotional, spiritual quest from the accuracy of language to the internalization process of the reader. It is the story of one man, tormented by the demons of culture and society, declaring that it is only through our (paradoxical as it may seem) ""spiritual rationalizations"" of the world that we may come to exorcise it of its ambiguity and depravity. We may be able to assert elements of culture and religion with the certainty of our senses; however, we may not vindicate them to our souls - this is John Moriarty's belief. With one foot in the Kedron and the other upon ancient Ireland, John Moriarty seeks to define the (outside the beliefs of Greek philosophy) quintessential metaphysics of man."
5,A Book of Initiation,"Voices that make the difficult attempt of harmonizing erudition and mysticism are exceedingly rare in our age. John Moriarty's is such a voice. This book not only attempts a grand synthesis of a dozen world mythologies, but does so in a highly original, deeply personal way--the author is writing from his life, not only from his mind. The unorthodox, idiosyncratic style means that the book can be tough going in the early chapters, as one must learn to read a bit differently, but it is worth the effort. Full of spiritual, poetic, and philosophical insights, ""Dreamtime"" is a real gem."
1,In which an intelligent man turns his brain off,"John Moriarty, Irish philosopher and gardener, tries to restore a sense of Wonder and Mysticism by cobbling together a lot of scraps of world mythology and gasping at the resulting junkpile.It's a sort of precis to his multi-volume work of unrivalled gibber, ""Turtle Was Gone A Long Time"". No, I don't think he means the turtle that the elephants that support Discworld are standing on.This is the sort of thing that many Irish people think ought to be our contribution to the world. Sadly, I don't think that Moriarty is bring the Irish people back to natural religion, not when there are more immediate problems to deal with, such as major urban drug abuse and racism. This sort of spiritualistic burble is all very well-meaning, but it functions as a verbal fog in which the well-heeled can hide and reassure themselves that for all their investments they're cultured people really.Bah. Humbug."
1,Dissappointed,"Used this with the Clarity Max and saw no improvement in water color, if anything it was worse. Back to using the Tetra stuff. I was really hoping that this would work."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this after reading reviews on the oxo travel mug. Many said it kept things very warm for a long period of time. My experience is to the contrary. I've sealed the lid as tightly as I can, and I may get a decently warm drink for 30 minutes or so...The only accurate information I did get is that it doesnt spill!!! Hope this helps!"
5,Good things come to those who wait,"After waiting many many years, my favourite Australian movie, Violet's Visit, has been released on DVD. Horrayyy!!!! It is a beautiful story based in Sydney Australia. This was one movie that helped me come to terms with being gay. Homosexuality is present here as being so normal and no big deal. It's a shame that this movie wasn't a commercial success in Australia (I've never met a fellow Aussie gay man who has actually seen it LOL). But if you get the chance, check out Violet's Visit - it will leave you with a smile on your face."
4,Australia's Answer to La Cage aux Folle?,"Two out and proud gay men are ""living in sin in Sidney"" and have been for 7 years. Alec (Graham Harvey) is the owner of a gym and Pete (David Franklin) is an attorney. When Alec's 15-year-old daughter Scooter (Rebecca Smart) shows up after running away from her small town life and her mother's constant stream of boyfriends, Alec and Pete's well ordered life is thrown into chaos.The boys are faced with the problem of two 40ish gay men adjusting to the mess left in the wake of an adolescent girl. The daughter is faced with sorting out her romantic feelings amid the good-looking and unavailable men who are more attracted to her dad than to her. And we are faced with a refreshing, upbeat look at some of the newer problems of ""modern family life.""Best line in the movie...Daughter: Fathers don't kiss their daughter's boyfriends in the street. Daughter's Boyfriend: Not often...enough."
3,Very Average and Disappointing 1812 and Marche Slav,"This recording is a part of the old Great Performances series on the CBS label. The performance of the 1812 Overture and Marche Slav may have been critically acclaimed but the recording is not up to today's standards. I think it suffers from remixing. The recording fails to rise to the vibrant and victorious level one expects of the 1812 and the march misses where it should suceed. Romeo and Juliet on the other hand is quite enjoyable, especially the finale. If you bought this recording only for the last, you would be happy. You can look elsewhere for the first two works."
3,Its good but not the best.,"I thought the 1812 was okay, due to having the mercury recording one which is my favourite so far - real cannons! I liked the Marche Slave since it was the first time I ever heard it. The Romeo and Juliet is good but a bit too slow for me. I like my classical loud and fast! Overall I wasn't too impressed with this recording. If you love Berstein, which my sister does, then you will probably like this. If you want the best, keep looking."
2,Dissapointing........,"The 1812 is really ordinary. No emotions in the piece...and the CANON...YUCK, it's just like someone bang the Timpani with the largest power...which is meaningless. And the Romeo, is disgusting. There are many errors with the percussions. Which are disgusting, they bang it without a note in the score.If you buy it, you will be regret!I recommend to get the Metha, for the same pieces. Three of them."
4,some inspiring stories,"This book contains some very inspiring stories about journalists who have fought to uphold the ideals of their profession in the face of corporatization, advertising, public outcry, etc. For those of you who like me still believe in journalism that's objective, or at least as objective as possible, this will help restore your faith. Read it from the journalists themselves who have won the battle, and some who have not. The first chapter, ""We still scream"" by two small-town journalists is especially inspiring."
5,Helps out the old pup,"Iv been buying this for my old lab, she's able to move around alot more and her quality of life is much better. She is much happier and it shows!"
4,"Aids mobility for our 12-yr old, 100-lb Black Lab","Arthogen seems to do a good job keeping our 12-yr old, 100-lb Black Labrador Retriever mobile. He is able to stand up, sit, and take short walks without obvious discomfort despite his age, knee surgeries on both knees a few years ago, and arthritis in both hind legs. We just switched from Glycoflex Stage III to Arthogen for Dogs hoping that Arthogen would be more effective, but it wasn't. The two medications seem about the same in terms of effectiveness - both are good but not miraculous (which may be unrealistic on our part). We would purchse either product again, or, we may continue searching for a miracle cure."
5,Arthogen,"Our German shepherd is 12 and has begun to have problems with her back legs. She has now been taking Arthogen for about two months and is beginning to improve dramatically. Good stuff, no steroids."
4,Gripping real life murder,"Fascinating. The bok describes some of the more interesting cases from scotland yard over a hundred. They say that real life is stranger than fiction and this book proves it. I liked the book very much, written by someone with real life experience of scotland yard, Tom Tullett goes through the cases never missing a detail and showing the incredible skill that the yard's officers used in a time before technology was abundant. As the book progresses, he talks about the new methods which were employed so they always caught their man. A must read for anyone with an interest into murder mysteries and history of policing"
2,"Unless you are OUTRAGEOUS, don't bother","I have all the party game books that Amazon sells. I found this to be the least helpful. My friends are all outgoing but I only found 3 things in the whole book that they MIGHT attempt to do. Its definitely geared towards college aged people (I'm 32, married 11 years.) or at the very least people that drink enough to lose all their inhibitions. Just wanted to forwarn you!"
3,What you expect from Negima!?,"Negi and his girls go on a seaside vacation. After accidentally seeing Asuna naked, Negi is depressed about her being mad at him. The other girls come up with a silly plan to reconcile them. After that, They all go to a spa resort. Nothing important happens. Nodoka spends most of her time wit Negi while the other girls try to get his attention away from her.This special is fun, but that's about it. It's rated TV MA. I think that's overdoing it a bit. It's just a bunch of girls in towels and bathing suits, with an occasional suggestive scene or 2. This should really be TV 14. It's everything you expect from Negima!? Just a little more risque."
2,A wasted opportunity,"OK folks, big diehard fans of Negima like myself were expecting big things from the OVAs and not like the DBZ movies were its in an alternate universe from the show but thats exactly what we get. First off its short, REAL short. You could have stretched both into 3 episode OVAs on 2-discs making the experience more enjoyable. Instead we have every character smashed in for cameos with no partciular roles except for the ones we're accustomed to: Negi, Asuna, Ayaka, Konoka, Setsuna, Yue and Nodoka. That's right only 7 out of 31 characters were actually used properly. The biggest problem is the 2 episodes clearly took turns bashing and favoring both Asuna and Nodoka which is fine for some but for me it was a wasted opportunity to progress the relationships with some of the characters, finalize a romance with Negi and Asuna/Nodoka or bridge a gap into the second season. If you like more of the same go buy it, but for others go watch on YouTube but not a recommended purchase."
2,From Back Cover,"Samantha Baldwin hates to lose. And she never does-unless her longtime rival, sexy Josh Crandall, is somehow involved. So when she learns that once again Josh has arrived on the scene just in time to ruin her professional life, she decides to play dirty. Her plan? To flirt her way to a promotion by wearing a skirt-a ""man-magnet"" skirt, one with th power to have any man eating out of her hands in seconds. But to her surprise, the only man Samantha attracts is Josh. And the chemistry between them lasts long after he takes off her skirt...Part of the Single in the City series."
3,for my leopard gecko,"there isn't an on/off toggle or a timer, you have to plug it in to turn it on, unplug to turn it off.it also takes awhile to heat up, and has a pretty short cord...I'd recommend you splurge a little and get one with a toggle and timer, or order an extension cord with this one"
4,great,"i got this for my beared dragon. a little small for his size. i think he will love it, but dont use it as the only heat sorce for your lizard."
2,An excellent argument for buying tunes on i-tunes,"First, a word about my preferences. I like my Celtic folk straight up, with relatively traditional elements and arrangements. When Talitha MacKenzie stays away from the synthesizer and the drum machine she makes me very happy. She has a lovely voice and she shines in the simplest tracks on this album. Unfortunately, most of the tracks have been arranged as 80s pop tunes, which have not aged well.This in mind, I recommend the following tracks:Uamh an Oir (The Cave of Gold -- Mouth Music)Rol Hol Ill Leo (Waulking Song, Sea Shanty)Theid Mi Dhachaigh (The MacKenzie Lullabye) -- very lovely.Otherwise the album is a bust."
4,Was Aristotle a good guy?,"My greatest surprise with this book is not the mystery itself, it is to discover Aristotle as a good guy. I always thought poorly of Aristotle: Much of his philosophy has been proven wrong (like the separation between ""mind"" and ""heart"") and was treated as part of the faith by the Catholic church for centuries. This endangered the progress of science and created plenty of religious conflicts. Although he is not responsible for the bad use made of his writings, I would not use him as a good guy in a novel. As a result, I found this series of Aristotle novels very entertaining. I was not surprised to discover later that the author was a professor at the University of Notre-Dame. We cannot escape our roots! Excellent read, maybe lacking a bit of historical details. Now in real life, was Aristotle a good guy? Between you and me, I doubt it. More admirable than amiable, said one of his translators. But who knows?"
3,Has its Moments,"An eclectic collection of songs. There are nice instrumental moments which I wished had lasted longer, including some very good guitar work. Some of the vocals are a little weak. My first String Cheese CD so I didn't know exactly what to expect. Not sure if I will buy another. This may grow on me over time."
4,Worth listening to even though it is a studio effort,"This was my first SCI disc, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Indeed, given their rep for primarily being a live jam band, I had some doubts about how much I would like it. Well, I am very glad that I took a chance on this CD because I enjoyed every minute of it, especially the electronic sounding songs. Even though there was a diverse mix of songs, I thought that they fit together well and that the disc generally was well produced. I subsequently have gotten several live SCI discs, which I didn't like any better than this one, so I would not hesitate to get it if you are an SCI fan, even though it is a studio CD. I unfortunately got the original version of the CD, which did not come with the bonus disc, which would make this an even better value."
3,A different sort of Cheese,"As others have commented, this is a very studioish album compared to what is expected of SCI.SCI mixes and matches genres here, but the outcome isn't always listenable.I find 'Sirens' and 'Valley of the Jig' incredibly annoying and skip them every time they come round.'Mountain Girl' and 'Tinder Box' are borderline emo/industrial and not executed very well in my opinion. I listened to them a few times and that was all I needed to hear.'Elijah' is a somber piece that sounds befitting of a movie soundtrack, but it's rather tame if Cheese is expected.I'm being overly critical, really. The rest of the album is eminently enjoyable. I would describe the theme as a slightly trippy Elton John meets Panic (what I mean is most evident on 'Who Am I' and the opening track). 'Time Alive' has sent me into psychedelic shock every time I have listened to it.I have not yet had an opportunity to listen to the bonus disc since my copy did not come with it. It is available on P2P networks..."
4,SCI meets Pink Floyd,"This is a challenging disk to be sure. There are some truly spectacular moments to be sure. Also a few stretches that bog down a bit. To me, it has a strong pink floyd vibe...dark side of the moon and wish you were here particulary. It is going to take repeated spins for this one to sink in. For those of you who like SCI's occassional forays into bluegrass, be aware that they left the mandolins at home for this one. All in all, an effective and impressive stretch from a great band!"
2,ok,"honestly, i had this album on my ipod already, but i bought this album for the alex grey art inside the book.....that's the reason why i bought it used on amazon....just for the picture...."
4,"bad at first, good the second or thrid time around","The first time I listened to this CD, I though, ""Is this really String Cheese?"" I didn't know if this was a joke or if they were serious. I took the CD out of my CD player after 6 or 7 songs, but when I put it back in a couple days later, it was alright and then the thrid time it was really good. I wouldn't compare it to Round Room though; I don't think it is the same sound. If you do not truely like String Cheese, then you will not like this album, but for true fans, this is a must have."
4,Damn Good Music,"I dont care what anybody says about this album, if SCI has changed for the worst part...so be it...but this album is filled with very good music. Some of the songs kind of carry on, becuase songs 4, 5, and 6 are basically one long jam, but its still damn good."
2,SCI Blues :(,"I was not anticipating a great album from Cheese, because I have listened to most all of their live shows from this year and their new material is weak. While their playing lately has been phenomenal, this album fails to communicate that. And what is up with the Phish riff from ""waste"" at the end of ""Wake Up"". I thought Cheese got all of their Phish sound out in at the end of ""It Is What It Is."" Their new material is uncreative, lacks direction, and most of all this album is overproduced!!! I am very disappointed to be writing this about SCI, but I feel their new sound is taking them into a very negative direction. Maybe next time youll get it right guys.Peace & Gouda"
2,unhappy...,"I'm a big SCI fan, i started listening in 2000 when Carnival '99 came out. This cd is a big departure from their bluegrass/jam ideas they played around with then. This cd is a boring attempt to sound more like a funk/space jam group. ""Valley Of The Jig"" is the only decent song on this album and it's a rip-off of ""First Tube"" by Phish on Farmhouse. It has the exact same bass-line and the other music in it is a fiddle tune called ""Red Haired Boy."" SCI has disapointed me with this cd. I recomend you buy ""Carnival '99"" and ""A String Cheese Incident."" Don't bother with this, it sucks."
3,Fair to Good,I bought some derm tabs from our veterinarian some time ago that worked very well and I thought these were the same. They were not and did not work as well in promoting a soft coat and relieving dry skin. I have found that regular Fish Oil capsules work just as well if not a little better then these.
5,CD review,As promised in perfect condition. Very happy with the item and the supplier. Shipped promptly.
3,Would have benefitted from an editor,"When I got this book, I was dismayed to see it was a self-published book, but I had nothing else to read, so I proceeded. I actually found it fairly engaging and enjoyable, with the distracting exceptions of when the writer had his(her?) characters switched and it was Nathanial when it should have been Frederick and so on. And other grammatical errors and typos. My advice to the author: have someone else read it before paying to have it printed."
4,Let the good times roll,"Excellent album. If you like Footloose or Danger zone only, don't buy it. For Loggins & Messina fans, also The Doobies. Warm, well balanced and good recording"
1,New Ideas,ever since Bonnie's last book Sidesdalle it seems to me that her books have lost the special feeling in them. THey need to put drawings back on the covers too. The girls in the photos look as if they arte 8-9 years old and the characters in the book are supposed to be 12-13. If u write a series u need to end it some day because no likes to read boring books that go on forever. And the new Pine Hollow books I found were uniteresting and stupid. Just because the girls in the book are in High school doesnt mean that they should lose all intrest in their horses. In my opinion Boonie Bryant is running out of ideas for Saddle Club books. And if she has no new ideas then she should end the series.I used to love Saddle Club but now they are just dissapointing.
1,Bonnie Bryant~Shes running out of ideas!!!! =(,"Ok- im getting sick of titles being reversed and the boring plot... lets face it... bonnies running out of ideas for these books-and plus- there hasnt been a new pony tails book since february of 1998! if youre gonna start a series...FINNISH IT!!! she could hire me to write these books... i love to write and wanna be an author!!!^-^ Then theres the ""pine hollow"" series. i totally lost intrest in those. just because theyre older... doesnt mean they have to be cool and barely care about their horses!!! Theyre sooo lucky to have a horse... THEY SHOULD APRECIATE IT!!!! *Thank you for reading my reveiw.These are my opinions and if you dissagree,then just dont be angry* Arrigato! ^-^"
5,What is it w/ you?!!!!!!!!!,"What is it w/ you people?! ""What crap"",""just plain stupid"",""running out of ideas"",""boring""? Wow,you guys sure are supportive!If you don't wanna read these books,DON'T!What reason is there to come on here and go crazy if you hate this series.I'm actually a fan(gasp) believe it or not,and love bonnie Bryant.So ""Um.......no"" The Saddle Club is a wonderful series,and if you have a problem don't read them.You don't have to come here and go off about how ""stupid"" you thought they were.Fans don't wanna hear it."
3,Not what I expected.,"I was a little dissapointed to find out that this CD contains none of the dialogue I remembered from the Psalty tapes as a kid. It's songs only. And the Arky Arky song I like so much isn't on here either. Other than that, it's still a great CD for your whole family to enjoy."
3,psalty,"when i was young, i remember my mom bought me a gospel kids songs that goes something like this... the lyric goes something like ""add some joy and laughter till it makes a bubbling sounds"".. then ends with.. ""serve it with a willing heat and serve it to the king!"" -i am looking for it desperately and i wonder is it in Psalty's album.. i want to lay my hands on it.. i have been looking for it for years.. thanks..."
4,Cowboy in the Jungle Reminisces,"I could almost smell the Eastside desert while listening to this new Cd. Shooting pool,C swinging and taking in the lyrics of Talk To Me. Hey Richard from N.H. I REMEMBER THE PAWNBROKER! Is Jerry playing in Hawaii ?"
5,Memories!,I used to work at The Pawnbroker! We lived for the 2 weeks each year that he came to rock the house. This new cd takes me back to the good ol' days. Jerry's voice is just as powerful as I remember and the songs are great. Where can I find some of the other recordings? Anybody know?
3,Pretty Basic,This is a good reference book for the beginner and the layperson. It would be a good addition to your personal library.
3,Back to School.,This bible handbook reminds me of a school textbook with homework assignments :( It ask you tough questions and study certain verses. If you do all the suggestive assignments I am sure you will better enlighted than the person (like myself) who is just going to read through it and then use it as a reference book when preparing for Sunday School participation.
4,cool,"I bought this for the extra features. it's cool to see the origins of someone's career. Although a lot of the ""shorts"" on it seem like non-movies, just stuff being put out there."
3,So-so Mumblecore,"Not a lot happens in this movie. It aims to portray the feeling of being back at home after graduating from college, a time when many of us feel a weird disconnected drift. It does this. By not with the same dynamism or excitement that Dunham writes into ""Girls""."
4,very smart and entertaining,Really fun indie movIe. I really love the conversations and the dynamics between the characters. A real trying to find yourself story.
1,Overhyped!,"I wanted to see this movie since Dunham is considered the ""It"" girl right now. After watching this, I don't get it. It was hard to finish because I didn't identify with any of it. But then, I didn't identify with the show ""Friends"" either, and look how that went. But back to Dunham -- the only thing I see is that she's brave for revealing so much about herself when society tells women like her to cover it up and keep it to herself. For that, I applaud her. As for this movie, not so much."
2,Excrutiating video,"This was a rental. The quality was ok. The movie was excrutiating. I wanted to stand up and slap the screen. There was no point to this film beyond whining and whimpering and refusing to take control. Panty waist is what this girl (and any like her) is. This movie got good reviews from a few critics. Clearly they need a life. What is worse, based on this film, the lead now has expanded this trite drivel to an HBO series. Wow, HBO must have new execs with no clear direction to take on this crap."
2,an interesting story ruined by bad acting and directing,"i want to like films like this one. it's an indie film made by a woman, about a woman, starring a woman. the story itself is compelling - providing a realistic portrayal of a young woman's post-graduate aimlessness. but the acting and directing are so very bad that it is painful to watch. jemima kirke, who plays charlotte, is the only actor that does justice to her/his character. undergraduate film students are exhaustingly self-indulgent and self-centered. portraying these characteristics in a film is realistic. wallowing in these characteristics as a film maker is immature."
1,IS NO STARS A OPTION?,"I didn't get it and could only get through 3/4 of the movie.Please someone tell me the funny parts because I was bored silly and could not understand how EW gave this a A rating.Annoying, boring actors without anything to hold any kind of entertaining merit."
2,Boring,Don't waste your time.......unless you are needing something to aid in obtaining restful sleep?I watched it to the end.....and sleep would have been more exciting....
5,Lena Dunham is the best!,"The forerunner to Lena Dunham's HBO hit ""Girls."" College graduate returns home to mom and sister (played by Dunham's actual mom and sister) and struggles to find her niche socially and in the job market. I am a grandma who loves Lena Dunham's work. It's fresh, honest and wonderfully entertaining."
2,Too real,I appreciated the intimate style of this movie. We just found it a little too raw and sad to enjoy. The protagonist is in such an awkward place. She plays it in such realistic mode that it just feels uncomfortable watching her. We didn't come away feeling anything for her but regret and embarrassment. The lead actress is very courageous. She allows herself to be very vulnerable in the film. Just too real to enjoy.
5,Huge Fan of Brainquest,"I share the opinions of most of the favorable reviewers of this product. These BrainQuest decks have really increased my two-year old's vocabulary. I am really impressed with this product. My daughter also loves Max the Monkey. It is made of foam, but it seems to be sturdy enough for her. BrainQuest decks, along with the Leapfrog Learning DVD series have really helped my daughter increase her language and math skills. I would recommend these to anyone who would like to help their child have fun learning."
1,There are 3 cards about CHRISTMAS in deck 2!,"My wife bought this for our son and he absolutely loves them. He calls them ""max cards"" and asks to see them all the time.HOWEVER, upon reading deck 2 to him I discovered that there are 3 (THREE) cards devoted to CHIRSTMAS. (this is reason review is 1 star instead of 5)Personally, I believe that religion should be taught in the home. If the makers of these cards wish to include religious holidays they should not only print the names of the holidays they include on the box but they should also include a sampling of holidays from ALL religions.I decided to ""edit"" the deck of cards. Unfortunately, the flip side of those Christmas cards are the Birthday Party cards. So, now my son won't get to see Max celebrate his birthday since I don't want him to see Max celebrate Christmas. And I am unsure if our family will purchase any future cards from this company."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"I got this set for my 2 year old and he absolutley loves it. It is so cute. He has such a good time with them and sits down with me and answers all my questions. He is learning so much already. It is introducing him to insturments, season, fruits and vegetable, going different places and soooo much more. I highly recommend these. I just bought the olders sets for my 6 year old. It will be a good way to continue the learning while on summer break!"
5,My boys love these,THe questions are very age appropraite and do well with short attention span kids. My son loves sitting and flipping through each card and answering the questions. I would recomend this product for all ages.
3,Not bad...but not great either,"I got this for my 15 month old daughter. We take out a lot of books from the library and read together and often while reading I ask her questions - what is X doing? where are his shoes? can you see flowers in the picture etc etc? So, this particular brainquest has words that she already knows and the questions themselves are relatively easy for her (we have done only the first, there are three).I try to keep up her enthusiasm for the brainquest by doing this as a special activity and only a few pages at a time."
2,Not great,"I was surprised when I got this after reading such good reviews that I really don't like it much at all. I thought it would be perfect for my daughter but really it just takes up space. We're already working on her languauge issues, and while you could use this somewhat for that, it would be just as easy to use whatever happens to be around you and forget the cards altoghter."
1,Don't waste your money with Barcana.,"The Barcana Alaskan Fir that I bought has been a real lemon. I have had trouble from day one with the lights. Have taken it back to the retailer for the past years to trouble shoot the problem. I called Barcana and was as much as told to get lost, we have been in business for 50 years. They (Barcana) were not the least bit sympathic and had no desire to solve an obvious problem with their product. I will never buy another Barcana product and would never encourage anyone else to do so. If you wish to buy an artificial Christmas tree buy one from a manufacture who will back up their product or don't buy their product."
2,Not for lovers of the 18th Century classics,"For those of us that truly appreciate the beauty of 18th Century music played on period instruments or modern orchestra instruments, this CD is not for us. I was very disappointed at the interruption presented with modern electronic instruments and modern vocal interpretations, none of which are identified in the product description. I also purchased Pachelbel Canon by Tomaso Albinoni, English Anonymous, Johann Sebastian Bach at the same time which I highly recommend and rate as 5 stars."
1,Note: 'HIT' - Singular,"It is certainly a beautiful song, and the fifteen recordings are interesting and well done on their own, but make sure you know that you are buying a CD with the SAME song 15 times over, just with different instruments... Otherwise, like me, you will be disappointed.I would rather have a mix of all of Pachelbel's compositions with this among it, than one of them over and over and over again."
2,Save your money,"I walked down the aisle to the Canon years ago, such a masterful and beautiful piece. Most of these versions just don't do justice. Sorry."
3,Pachelbel's Canon,Absolutely love this canon - but some of the variations on this cd were not so great. Probably was too much to expect.... Still enjoyable.
1,Uh no....no no no!,"LOL I bought two jars of this stuff, and I cant tell you if its any good becauseit was like cement. I thought this might be a good shortcut, but the ingredientswere literally frozen solid in the jar, I'm still laughing at my feeble attemptsto extricate this ""roux"" from its glass housing.This price is hilarious, its oil and flour fer chrisakes. Learn how to make yourown roux, its easy, and not as daunting a task as it may seem. This stuff... I'msurprised they're still in business. 1 Lonely Crawdad"
2,You gotta be kidding?,I have lived in south Louisiana for the past thirty years and am currently working in northeast Pennsylvania. And though I can make my own roux I have reached the stage where I have no problem with faster shortcuts. But the price on this product is well out of line. I expect everyone to make some money but a 1000% price markup is a little much. Try Zatarain's New Orleans Style Gumbo Base. It is available from Amazon and almost as good.
3,Quite so so,I have 7 different editions of this work and I don't tink that this one can be listed in the top 3.
4,classical music,The vendor of this product was very speedy. Ordered and received the product in two days. Great service!
5,Wisdom for everyone!,"If you wish to understand the universe and your place in it, listen to Maharishi's words and then learn TM (a simple, enjoyable mental technique which profoundly improves life on all levels)."
4,This is a really nice peice of work!,"This book has everything you'd want in a comic, action, humor, suspense, and the occational busty babe, if ya' know what I mean. Queen's artwork is terrific and really sets off the mood quite well. Not to mention the great dialogue. Gotta love Piece (read it and you'll understand). ""Here's your security breach buddy!"" It's great. Just quit reading this and get it. I'm serious. Go on. Leave. The review's over. I'm not kidding. This gag is gettin' very stupid, so I'll quit now."
5,"Excellent, Highly Recommended Compilation","It seems that Bill Withers is one of those artists whose compilations always seems to be missing consequential items. ""Lovely Day"" cures that problem. Every one of Withers's Top 40 songs from the 70's and 80's is here, as well as a nice selection of lesser charting singles and album cuts. If you're a Hot 100 completist, wanting every charted single regardless of position, or if you are an album explorer, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a high quality review of Bill Withers best known work, this is it."
1,book written in 1930's,It was hard to understand references from the 1930's when this book was written. This book was a waste of money and time for me.
5,"Hard to put down, valuable interviews, resources, exercises","Four sections are woven throughout each chapter:1) writing advice or commentary from the author,2) interviews of other writers,3) excellent resources (including web),4) educational, fun and difficult exercises.I have underlined many ideas in the book and will have to read this book several times to fully understand the author's comments. The author loves his subject."
5,A useful and advanced guide for the committed writer.,"RY does more than give you the answers: It gives you the questions. The broad scope of this guidebook ranges from thorough discussions of fiction basics, to deeper questions of technique and style, to a practical treatment of publishing and self-promotion. RY doesn't shy away from the realities of the writing world, but shows you how to conquer them. Also included are 40 interviews with authors, publishers and booksellers (including Samuel R. Delany, Raymond Federman, Kathy Acker and others) that bring fresh ideas and insight from the ones out there making the literary world happen. This is truly a must have for anyone serious about their writing."
1,Warning:This HDDVD contains NO live orchestra - JUST pictures,"This is preposterous and completely unacceptable!This HDDVD is a mere slideshow with the classic masterpiece accompanying. If I wanted this, I would buy a dvd-A. I was also annoyed by the fact that they are mentioning that the visual os 1080p. High definition my a_s.Amazon should stop selling this crooky product.Thanks/John."
1,So disappointed!,"The music is great, I'll give it that much. My daughter is OBSESSED with Vivaldi and I bought this because I thought it was going to show a CONCERT with live performers. We were sorely disappointed when we put the video in to discover there was no live concert! We already have Vivaldi's Four Seasons on 500 different CDs...we did NOT need an HD DVD with sound only *eyeroll* What's more annoying is that it took 3 tries to buy the ""right"" HD DVD player to play this video and then it's just music :P Unless it's just music you want, I wouldn't buy this DVD and I agree, the cover is VERY misleading >:-\"
5,THANK YOU JESUS...I FINALLY found this cd on Amazon! :),"I have looked for this for YEARS!!!And I FINALLY found this wonderful and anointed cd on Amazon....What a BLESSING! :)I hadn't heard the song ""Heart Free"" since 1996 or 1997....And I was OVERJOYED to hear it again! Wonderful!""Heart Free"" is no. 6 on the playlist...Also, I love ""This I Know""...no. 2 on the playlist...very upbeat and uplifting:)And then....I really love ""What a Hope""....no.3 on the playlist :)You will love this cd! Praise God I finally found it after 15 years!!Also....fast shipping....just as described...no problems! Seller was great:)"
1,Buy the Book,"Is a required book for a class in grad school. Really, really, really wish I would've bought the book instead. Yes, the book is big...but e-version is so difficult and frustrating to use, (and I'm fairly technical,) that I end up going to their website instead. A disappointing waste of money."
3,Solid but not as polished as I would expect from Sony,"The rest of the accessories for the UX-280P are very high gloss, well built, and rugged, but this item seems a little ""off"". The edges are a bit rough and the quality of the leather doesn't seem to be top-notch. However, it fits the UX series PCs just fine and looks executive enough at a glance to do the job. The only real knock on this is that there's no belt loop or other way to mount it on a shoulder strap or case. If you need that however, the mesh case that comes with the UX is more than good enough. In the end, it does the job it's designed for: being an upscale holder for UX series PCs.Rating: 3 stars, two held back for no mounting abilities, somewhat rough materials, and no embossing, metal dies, or other high-end detailing."
4,Fits,"Nice case that fits well, even with the extra capacity battery. The only issue that I have with it is that the clasp is a magnet! Why Sony would place a magnet on a computer case is beyond me. I have been keeping the screen facing opposite of the magnet clasp which seems to work fine."
1,Magnets as closures? Come on. . .,"There was nothing in the description of this product that said it used magnets to hold the top closed. Magnets? On such a tiny but expensive computer, right next to the monitor and the hard disk drive? What were they thinking? I never put my UX in it and promptly sent it back."
5,winds of graystone manor,I love this book. It had romance and mystery. I like a book that can keep you on the edge of your seat. This book is one of them. And the author tells the story without fowl words in it.But I'm sad to say that the author has not wrote the other books for this trilogy.
2,Buy their OTHER live CD,"This ain't good. MH are AWESOME...they are awesome LIVE and in the studio...this CD sounds like some amateurs who are pretty good at imitating them. With their level of perfection and synch I am surprised their producer, their label, and they themselves allowed this to be released. Plus it sounds muffled and lacking an ambient live sound. Their previous live CD is stand out!"
2,Disappointing technically and in content,"I've been a fan of MT for some 30 years, both collectively, and a fan of Janis' solo work. I've enjoyed most of their forays into jazz over the years, but I really didn't connect as well with the ""Swing"" and ""St Louis"" albums. I found the arrangements too ""busy"" and just occasionally noise for noise sake. This live album reinforces my feelings concerning their recent musical directions. I found it basically unpleasant to listen to because of poor sound, and the arrangements, with a couple of exceptions. Overall, a disappointing effort technically, and this is one listener they have left behind over the past five years.There's nothing ""wrong"" with what they are singing these days...I just find a lot of it too showy, and un-musical. just an opinion from a former fan who will await Janis' next solo work, and maybe something new from Keely Smith.I mean, ""Gone Fishin?"" What a five minute exercise in boredom!"
1,Embarrassing!,"I have been an enthusiastic fan of TMT since the 70s, but this is too bad! The sound is awful and does in no way make justice to the original recordings. Buy the albums Swing and Spirit of St. Louis instead, they are great!"
1,Disappointing,This once great group needs some new direction. A new producer would help a great deal. Someone rescue them please.
1,Make them stop!!!,What were they thinking? I've seen them many times over the years and have enjoyed many of their records/discs but this live set is a doozy. The sound is only fair (shocking for this label) and the vodie-ot-doit 30s shhtick is worn as thin as the hair on the fellow's hair. Time for the theme park!
4,How to inform and protect - all you need to know.,This book gives you all you need to know to execute a successful public outreach program. It gives you the support you need to get the most of your own internal and external communication programs. The book is a great help in organizing your thoughts and timing of events. It will also help you to get the most of your agency or freelance contacts.A perfect tool!
2,Mismatched,"Bought a Gilmour spray doc sprayer and wanted the fan-shaped tip. That item is priced separately but the replacement kit reviewed here says it has the fan tip plus some additional parts for about $1 more. So I bought this kit instead. Sprayer tip was NOT the fan tip advertised but same one that came with the original sprayer.The replacement part kit does NOT contain the two parts you are most likely to lose and therefore need the most--the two nylon bushings inside the sprayer tube assembly. These parts, being nylon, do not make a great seal, and you will have to use Plumber's Grease to keep them from leaking and dripping. Also, if you unscrew the assembly to clean it the bushing fall out easily, which is why they should be in the replacement kit."
4,its alot of fun to play with,its fun to play with but i wanted to get inuyasha but i got miroko..its still really fun to play with
5,Case Closed Double Feature,The purchase arrived rapidly and in good condition. The disks were in excellent shape and played with out problems. The purchase was an easy one and got me the product I wanted at a very good price.
4,The Case,"This double feature movie was a pretty good buy. I enjoyed watching the anime Case Closed and watching this double feature make the show a lot better. I suggest that you by this double feature movie set because it is a great deal for what the asking price is. Also the double feature movies are really good for those that are fans of Detective Conan. Even if you haven't seen Close Case, the movie will hook you right in. So I give this double feature movie two thumbs up."
4,Auto Ventshade 984004 Unpainted,"If your looking for a hood ornament thats easily installed, looks good and of good quality - this is it."
1,WRONG ITEM SENT 2X,"The incorrect item was sent not once, but twice. A flat 11 inch Spode cake platter was ordered. In its place, a concave plate/bowl was sent that could not accommodate even an 8 inch cake. Am attempting to get a refund, but an online message indeicates that a refund is not avalable and, therefore, neither is an exchange. Am extremely dissatisified, especially since this was a gift sent to a relative."
2,Reasoning behind the rating,I have been a dedicated fan of Tokio Hotel ever since I first say their music video for Schrei on FUSE. After listening to a few of their other songs off of MySpace I decided to order their cd thus I was displeased when I opened the package after receiving the album in the mail.After paying $12.46 plus $5 for shipping&handling; I come to find the cd only holds 4 tracks (about 3:33 each) and a music video. The page for ordering this cd (here on amazon) failed to mention this.I am dissatisfied with my purchase.
3,Not as long as I had expected,Really pretty but was short - more like a choker with a tail than a long lariat. I wish it was longer though - its really very nice.
3,The most important concert by guitar an orquestra,"In my opinion, this is the best example on guitar concerts, closly fine and suitable for experienced people."
1,I wish I could give it a 0,"I received this movie in damaged condition so I returned it for a refund. HOWEVER, I saw it at a friends house and it was AWFUL. Of course, it's homemade quality, terrible lighting, and shaky camera work. You can barely hear the actors but the sound effects are loud. The movie was stupid, the plot, was foolish, and the fright factor was non exisitent. The movie had a couple spiders, shadowy figures, a drop of a telephone book, and a tipped over bottle for action/scare. WOW! This movie was painfully dumb. Don't waste your time and ESPECIALLY do not waste your money."
5,"Antique Boxes, Tea Caddies and Society Book review","My wife enjoyed the book very much, very enlightening and educational, well done and presented. Worth the cost and more!"
5,Inspirational boxes,"As a woodworker and some time box maker I found this and inspirational book. Boxs are arranged in historical periods, by type and by the origin of their decoration. The social and commercial history of the times and and its influance on the boxes is fascinating reading. There is only limited technical detail of construction methods and fittings. However all photographs, which are colour, are of an extremely high quality and have very detailed captions. Excellent."
5,For the many or the few Gorgeous,"This is a ""feast"" for the eyes. A History of some of the most beautiful boxes highlighting the mastery of the Human spirit... and hand."
2,Not worth the money...,"This is a very disappointing set. The images are a little blurry and have not been cleaned up for transfer to DVD. The synchronization of picture and sound is off in many places in an annoyingly transparent way. Not all the symphonies are in the concert hall, but rather located in the odd studio that looks very dated in the late 60's and early 70's.Soundwise, these are fine, but nothing spectacular.I have high hopes for DVD as a medium for classical music- and some that I have bought {see my review of Perlman/Barenboim on EMI} have met or exceeded what I have hoped for.For myself, and from now on, I am not going to buy old recordings made into DVD's unless the reviews indicate that it is worth it. These most certainly are not. A little patience, I am sure, and a new recording will be made. After all, this should be fairly easy to do: Record live concerts."
5,Wonderful old film,This is a great film where two distinctly different people from different backgrounds fall in love and choose a free life over a life of duty and obligation. Made back in the 40s it offers a particular view of the times and of differences between a monarchy and democracy.
2,Reverse Cinderella just doesn't cut it.,"This movie starts off with some clever and funny scenes between a sleeping pill induced Princess and an unsuspecting pilot. However, it quickly fades into tediousness as the romance between the Princess and the Pilot becomes ever more impractical. I don't know why, but reverse Cinderella stories just don't seem to work. And in this movie what should by all counts be a happy ending, ends up being a flat and unrealistic disappointment. Even for Hollywood. Part of it is that Robert Cummings as the Pilot doesn't come across as likeable as in some of his other films. He seems a little bit arrogant in a way. And I found myself not wanting them to get together because of his attitude. In the end, this movie is just for a night when there isn't anything else to watch."
3,Review by a College Student,"I had to use this Bible for one of my college courses, which was a basic course about the Old and New Testaments. I found this Bible to be very average. In class I felt like we never actually used the ""study"" part of the Bible very much; we mainly just read the passages, and only skimmed over the notes provided in the margins. I was gifted a different study Bible for my confirmation, and I find it to be much more interpretive and interesting. The Access Bible is just an average study Bible, nothing exceptional."
5,Very straight forward,"Where many books pertaining to linear algebra, differential equations and numerical analysis fail to give solid examples and outlined solutions, this book succeeds. The text is written for comprehension. It's not pretty. Requires practice. But if you found other books convoluted and confusing, this one will help you see what they were trying to say."
1,15 well deserved minutes,"This book has been a wonderful help in my own healing process. As a single working mom of two boys and little time to spare, this 15 minute routine has help me to have courage, clarity and peace."
5,yes it is true,"a concise, clear and throughly honest look at doing nothing. the moments when dust in the air is an epiphany and the smell from a passing fire truck is more alarming then the siren. i admit to personally having known the poet in an earlier time and the sage has stayed true to his sad sack self. god i love and miss the man...johnny call the gallery... miss you....j poe"
5,New Jazz Lover,"Wauu!This is the best musician ever!I enjoy his music very,very much.Noro!!!Right now, im listening Braun's and Boney James work.It's incredible."
1,Disappointed,The image presented for this item led me to believe it was a long replacement for the original attached wand. Instead it is a plastic attachment.
2,Not seen this yet......,"Never heard of INVISIBLE AVENGERS, but even though Lon Chaney Jr is in BRIDE OF THE GORILLA the DVD cover gives us a picture of his father........ well researched folks !!!!"
2,my first attempt at a review,"If you buy this dvd, you are only getting one fairly decent movie because ""The Invisible Avenger"" is a total loss."
4,valve,"this is a very good product, fit my need very well, would recommend it to all users, thank you very much"
3,Good concept falls a little short of expectations,"I like the ability to roll the sprayer around andnever having to stop and pump. there is just oneproblem You still have to stop frequently androll it back and forth in order to restore sprayingpressure. Better than pumping, but a bit shortof expectation, which was that the pressure wouldmaintain while walking and pulling the sprayer."
5,Gilmour Sprayer Replacement,It was difficult to find the Sprayer Replacement. It would be nice to know exactly what is in the packets prior to purchase as I didn't need all the parts but couldn't purchase what I needed seperately. Glad to have found it. Works great.
5,not good,"I feel that the book could have been less elaborate. I say this because you are waisting your time by reading all the mumbo-jumbo within the actual basic context. A better, more understandable version is The Oedipus plays of Sophocles...a new translation by Paul Roche... By that one instead..."
3,Essential but not perfect,"As masks go, this mask is comfortable and durable because of the foam. However, I have a similar lion mask purchased a year ago and I noticed that the paint starts to crack. So this is not a mask to last the ages. But it suits the purposes of Halloween and for the price, you can get a couple of Halloweens out of it. It should also be noted that the mask runs a little small. The face has a low forehead and isn't really adult-sized. It probably best suits a child of six or seven. But for any young kid who loves wild animals and wants to pretend to be one, it's an essential buy."
3,"Nice place to visit, wouldn't want to live there","I really wanted to get my hands on this book and now that i have (via interlibrary loan) i want to warn folks that this is not light reading. I found a majority of this book very boring and all but impenetrable. I like Dijkstra's English prose, but when he embarks on the math I wish he'd state the point of each set of formulae above them. It would have also helped if he stressed practical uses of his insights vis-a-vis an actual programming language. This ""just shows how much I know"" I'm sure, but I suspect many people will feel similarly. FYI: My background is Bachelor's in C.S. with a C.S. GPA of 3.87/4.0. A depressing indictment of U.S. education, Dijkstra would say :)"
1,Car Charger,I received this item and it fell apart when I took it out of the package. Was not worth even the shipping cost.
3,A book of intruguing veiwpoints,"This work is an excellent debut from an author i've never heard of, the prose is excellent (and can be extrememly gripping at times, a hard peice of work to put down), and the ideas intuguing. I wouldn't suggest it to everyone, esp those faint of heart or are easily disturbed. I was introduced to this work by an issue of last years ""Burning Bush"" magazine.All in all, a great start, and excellent first novel...not a work of genuis yet, but shows promise for future works. Speaking of which, after visiting the six gallery press web page, it seems a new work will come out spring 2003 called Clockwerk also done by Paul M Jessup (no period in his middle name? who does he think he is? e.e. cummings?) that looks promising. Hopefully it keeps the same level of writing and expands upon it, showing the genuis that seems to be only hinted at here."
4,"Great performance, older recording methods.","Szell was one of the great conductors, and this is a fine example of his work. Recording technique is dated because this comes in a series from some years ago. But still a good value. NOTE: The CD case was badly cracked in the back because it was shipped in a padded envelope. But the recording was unaffected, so I kept it."
5,Great Book for Non-Cooks!,"These recipes are simple, easy, but don't taste simple - they actually taste more sophisticated than I expected. Especially the Southwest Chicken Skillet and the Southwest Chicken Soup! Also, these are mostly ingredients you can buy and keep in the freezer for when you need them."
3,only if you are comfortable,"Aliens who are so like us yet so different, a combination of dedicated and deadly yet gentle samuri and ancient Greek warriors. Unfortunately every emperor other than Claudius has been evil or mad, but there should be good adventure in subsequent books. Only those truly comfortable with their own sexuality need read this one."
3,Re: It is a Favorite for Newbies,"<Oracle 8 Bible> is my first purchase on Oracle stuffs. For a naive newbie, it is appealing since it has a lot of pictures and a step by step walkthrough on different aspects of Oracle. Each concept is explained in quite a simple way. Even today, I still find the discussion on import/export very useful and I keep on referring them from time to time.The book is intended for the newbie market. You will be disappointing if you have quite substantial experience and want the book a great reference. For one thing, the book focuses too much on Oracle in the NT environment and you will find helpless if you are working in an Unix environment.I still make use of its reference from time to time. Its command reference is still much easy and clear to use than the Oracle manual.In a word, it would be a great ""bible"" for newbies."
2,Not a good reference,"I bought this book because the reviews here said it was well written and useful. I found it to be neither. It does have some information on the OEM tools. Basically, it seems to be more of a dictionary of Oracle terms than a practical guide to using the program."
1,Not helpful at all!,"I bought this book on the advice of the previous recommendations-- Frankly, I really wonder what a two or one star book would look like! The book is positively DISMAL in its explanation of setting up and tuning Oracle databases. It seems as if it runs upon a dilemma: If you know enough to understand this book, you probably don't need it. If you don't know all that much about Oracle already, this book can't help you. The only thing it has that may be interesting is an index of SQL commands.I have had pretty good luck with other IDG books in the past, but this one is worse than if I were muddling along without it. At least then I would know was in the dark!"
2,Careful...,"the top comes off extremely easily, so I always hold the top on while shaking. Thin material, but reasonably attractive. Just be aware that if you forget to hold the cover on, you'll likely have a cup FULL of whatever this holds!"
3,Kinda interesting,"This movie follows a young Aum disciple who acts as the spokesperson for their cult while ""The Master"" is on trial. He has to deal with an agressive media and angry citizens.I was expecting an explanation of the attack, but the people filmed do not appear to have been involved in it. It does give an interesting insight into Japanese life. The people who give the young man advice tell him to get a job and work hard. The police operate differently and that's pretty interesting.I have to admit, I watched it in fast forward through lots of it because there are long stretches where nothing happens. I would've fallen asleep if I hadn't.I'd like to see what the spokesman is doing now(10 years later), and I'd like to see police and psychologist interviews and I'd like it to be shorter. I guess I'm an average impatient dude."
