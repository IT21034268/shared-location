2,Quiet? Not so much....,"""SilentComfort"" leads one to think this air purifier would be very quiet. I'm disappointed at the amount of sound it makes on high and medium speeds. It is seriously distracting to have it running while listening to the TV, and I've moved it into another room. Honeywell 1, us 0."
3,Huge unit.,"When I received this unit via UPS the driver threw it over my fence and it got rained on and was received broken. When I plugged it in of course it did not work. The research I did on it showed that it would have been a great unit, I was just never able to tell for myself.The unit was quite large and the carbon filter was not as large or think as other Honeywell designs."
1,Doesnt get rid of smoke well,"The primary reason I purchased this model was to handle smoke. I have a small office room in my house where I spend a lot of time. For the winter, I wanted something that would remove most of the smoke. Which I previously had a honeywell, smaller model, which worked great, for about 3 months, I figured I would get a bigger and better model... This thing doesn't remove smoke half as well as the small one I had. I will say it may remove smoke over a long period of time, but I smoke about once an hour.I have a feeling the reason may be the airflow design, it takes in air from the bottom vents and pushes it out through the top. It would seem to me this thing is constantly cleaning the same air. My smaller model would pull in air from the front and force the air upward, out the back."
2,Does not deliver,"After much research, I puchased this filter for my bedroom to help control dust allergens. After several months of running the unit nearly non-stop, there has been absolutely no reduction in dust. I vaccuum every week and still have to hand-dust, and my bedroom is not that large.What I do like about the unit is that it is portable, so I will sometimes move it to the kitchen or basement to help control odors."
2,Okay product,"Bought the product because I used to wake up with red eyes. I was also very tired. Thought my allergies were really creeping up at night (when your immune system relaxes). Bought the filter like two weeks ago.First, pretty loud on both high and medium setting.Second, pretty big for a room air purifier.Third, seems to kind of work. Have been using it for two weeks, and it seems to kind of work. I'll give it a few more weeks to make a final decision. Might have been prudent to not get one at all or try for a better (more expensive) one."
5,great product,This product is exactly as described. The high setting is a little louder than I would of preferred. I run them (I bought two)on high during most part of the day than on medium at night when we're watching TV.
5,"quiet, clean and doesnt smell","Its perfect for keeping a clean room, white noise and it doesnt smell funny like some of them do. Also doesnt feel drafty.Perfect"
5,Clean Air,"I finally feel like I can enter and work in my office (nay, the 'bird' room) again! As advertised, it's cleaning the air well. Good for the bird and good for me!"
4,"Smooth, smooth, smooth","Beegie has such a light touch on the keys. Some jazz players seem to try to be too percussive on the keys, as if they don't trust the rhythm section to keep the groove going. Beegie has a sensitivity to the melody that other players lack in my opinion. I highly recommend this CD. To the person who wanted to know about a Christmas CD, she does have one. I don't know why it isn't on here, but I think the record label has a website where you can get it...or just bug (...) to find it!"
4,the gooseberry fool,"Hugo Swart was killed in his kitchen on the hottest night of the year. there was pain, and suspicion, and more dearth before the answer was found. Readers who know Kramer and Zondi-and the Widow Fourie-will be pleased to rejoin them in this, McClure's third novel about them."
5,very nice,"I used this to cut through drywall and mortar to get 4"" pvc pipes out the wall to vent the bathroom fan. The fit is tight. You need one of those 7/16 inch spindles. They will fit into 1/2"" chucks."
2,Doesn't get it done....,If you buy this hole saw because you need the deep cut you will be disappointed. The product is misrepresented in the picture. It is a standard depth saw...... Buy your tools at a store where you can see what you are buying.
5,works well A++++++++++,"I had to cut hole for my bathroom vent through four 2""X10"" plus 3/4"" ply, that is total of 12.5"", It did excellent job."
1,"LOUSY design, not built to last","The external surface, zipper closing, and actual, individual CD pockets in this binder are fine. However, the individual CD pockets have a plastic flap above them that's supposed to flip over and cover the CD which aren't quite sized right -- it is very hard to flip the flap over, and the plastic rumples.Also, the internal structure is poorly designed and the pins that hold it all together are made of plastic, not metal. The first night I got this I began, gently, putting in CDs, and when I had about 80 CDs in the binder, one of the plastic pegs holding the binder pages together cracked. I don't think it could reliably hold 128 CDs, and would not recommend this product to anyone. The older Radio Shack CD binder I picked up years ago is much better."
5,Mine Has Lasted Despite Abuse,"I've had mine a long time. I needed two more binders. One to add new disks, and another to replace a bad binder that I want to chuck out. I looked on the cover of my best binder - the one that has lasted the longest and it was CDPROJECTS. The one I am trashing was from Skoshie or something. Yeah the rings are plastic on the CDPROJECTS but you know what, the handset on my deskset phone is plastic too and I can hammer a 6d nail with it. And the zipper has never played ""hide n seek"" with me or ""tug of war"" either.If you loaded it with 128 disks, kept it in a hot car, let the dog sit on it, and never closed the zipper... then maybe, just maybe it would wear down. I've been burnt by a lot of crappy products out there but have never been burned twice. The fact that I am a return buyer is a good testimony.That's my story, and I'm sticking to it."
5,"Expensive, but worthwhile.","Broadcasting is, to the laity, only concerned to television systems. Of course broadcasting engineers know the truth, the broad field covered by our career could lead to the development of specialities inside our own major as EE. All of the subjects that you need to know to transform your career from EE to broadcast engineering are covered in this book. Even those chapters like ""Planning an Audio Production Center"" are topics that I have never found in this kind of books, very useful for the broadcast projects engineer. There are some printer's errors that should be corrected in an errata, like ""x"" signs where there should be a ""+"", etc, but we understand this in such a huge work. This only book is enough for any consultation or hesitation that a broadcaster might have about any topic related to AM, FM radio, Television, Towers, Antennas, Satellite, DTV, etc. Nice work, and very topical."
4,Very well balanced CD,"This CD has a lot of Jazz-like elements and is very easy on the ears. I especially like the song ""Northern Lights"". I recommend this CD to anyone who likes Acid Jazz or Drum & Bass type music."
5,This kid is hot!,A must have.Recently heard a few cuts from this album and had to buy it.I highly recommend this album!
5,"Good product, but one short.","I love this product and try to use it as much as I can because of themulti-vitamin, mineral & trace mineral content. I can feel the difference.However, on my last order of 5 bottles which I was charged for, I onlygot 4 and have a letter mailed to get my other one. I hope I get a response.Tara Critchley"
1,A Survivor's Point of view,I am both a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and a Christian. I had high hopes for this book but I was gravely dissappointed. I find the Author's interpretation and presentation of scripture to be judgemental. I am sorry to say that I came away carrying more emotional baggage after reading this book than I had before I read it.She basically says that it is the victim's fault if he or she doesn't have a good relationship with God. She also offers advice in a quick fix manner.The book is summed up with nine reminders of faith that are presented throughout the book.In one of the nine the author actually suggests that you re-read the book if you do not feel healed after reading it the first time. I find this extremely arrogant on her part. In this conclusion the author places blame on the survivor if he or she neglects to be healed by her book.I would caution all survivors seeking guidance and support to look elsewhere.
5,Christian Witness,"This book surprised us with its clarity of witness. From a man in a land that fears the truth of the real Body of Christ Christian, comes this emmense testimony of overcoming in great darkness.What Brother Yun has revealed is the simplicity of just believing the Gospel and obeying that Gospel. The theologians may argue points of interest but this work puts things in perspective from a very simple faith and acceptance.I strongly recommend this work to any who are struggling with the doubts and concerns of this life in our time, to rekindle that faith that hears the 'still quiet voice' through the Scripture. You will not regret buying this book if you are a redeemed believer that Christ is Messiah. Shalom to all who KNOW Him."
5,Inspiring,This book will challenge you to examine yourself. I love this book. I recommended this to anyone seeking a deeper relationship with God.
3,Heavenly Review,"I think this book is really good. Its really well written and captivating. However, I'm hearing a lot of different opinions regarding the truthfulness of this story. So I'm not sure how much to believe. I guess I just need God to be my discernment on this one. But it is awesome to read about the Chinese culture and such."
3,Where is the proof that he's a hoax?,I read many great reviews and see a few that say he is a con man. But none of the ones stating that he's fake really say why and specifically what he does or has done to be such a con.I just started the book and so far nothing in my heart has felt doubt about what I've read.I picked it up while I was visiting the Philippines.
2,the violence never seems to cease........,"This book isnt for you if violence makes you queasy. I thought it was unbelievable what Yun went through, and it was an interesting book. I learned much about the history of Christianity, which I new nothing about before. However, I felt the book was very repetitive, as I cannot count how many times Yun went to prison, was electrocuted with a baton, beaten senselessly, etc. I definitely believe in miracles, but everytime I turned the page there was another one.......so many that it almost seemed unbelievable and I wondered if this story was actually true."
1,Disturbing,"I was happy to see a believer's testimony in print so I read the book as soon as it hit the shelves.I was disturb as I read ""brother Yun's"" account of how he commanded a man to become a Christian. It reminded me of the account of the conquistadors and the Aztecs. That account alone made me reconsider the testimony of Yun. At best Yun's testimony feels ego driven. It does not have the same language or feel as accounts from Corrie ten Boom, nor those in the Fox book of Martyrs, voice of the martyrs nor any or other believer's account of faith amidst persecution or difficult circumstances.Sharing the gospel is telling the good news of Christ not demanding or commanding anyone to believe or else. What was Yun's implied threat to the man? Perfect love cast out fear for fear has to do with punishment. Since when do we have the authority or right to command anyone to repent of their sins and become a Christian ?"
1,gobsmackingly bad bad bad,the rough outline of a story without character development based on the biblical book of acts--fail
2,Uncomfortable Listening,"This was definitely not an easy listen and at times extremely unpleasant. I actually read this book when it first came out in print years ago and I really enjoyed it and found Brother Yun's accounts very exciting and inspiring.Listening to this many years later I've not enjoyed it half as much. I think what I find really hard about it is the great suffering the author has experienced as a result of preaching the Gospel in China. At times he made it sound like God was torturing him to improve his character.The quality of this audio is excellent and the narrators come across very well. I enjoyed Jeany Park's narration of Yun's wife far more than Christoper Jean as the voice of Yun. Her voice was more natural and soft against what I found to be an arrogant edge to the voice of Christopher Jean. Though this is perhaps more to do with the way it is written, rather the narrator's voice.Thanks to christianaudio.com Reviewer's Program for the free copy."
4,excellent read,"this book was chock full of inspiration and nail biting saga. It is based upon his life, and what a life he lived in China. God's miracles displayed in this book will inspire you completely"
5,Life changing,"This book can change your life because it is a testimony of God's love and what he can do through the power of the Holy Spirit. I'm not sure how I started reading this book, but after I had read it, I wanted to share this book with everyone I knew, and I purchased multiple copies through Amazon."
5,Outstanding!,"In the same caliber as Corrie ten Boom's 'The Hiding Place,' 'The Heavenly Man' chronicles the spiritual journey of a contemporary minister of the 'house churches' of China in brother Yun's own words. In addition to the remarkable testimony of God's work in the life of this one man, the book gives an amazing insight into the underground church in China. Christians, forced to go underground due to the atheist communist government are often imprisoned, beaten and tortured for their faith, yet in their great affliction revival is spreading across China.The first half of this book alone is life changing.If you are a Christian, and this book is not on your reading list, it should be."
4,the heavenly man,A very well written story and very impressive of the faith of one person and the lengths that this man will go to to validate his faith
3,It's Okay,Bought this book for required reading for a missions class I am taking. A little slow but gets better towards the end.
4,Amazing Story,"The story of Brother Yun is truly amazing, it was a huge encouragement to my faith to read this book."
5,Let's set the record straight!,"I've just read some negative reviews and rebuttals to the book ""The Heavenly Man"" in which I found this link that provides the truth about Brother Yun and the book written by Paul Hattaway, the author of the book. Sadly there is much disinformation being spread about Brother Yun and Paul hopefully puts it to bed never to be resurrected again. If you haven't read this yet and you are skeptical about the content of the book, then you need to spend the 15 minutes required to read this letter.http://www.asiaharvest.org/pages/news050705OpenLetterBrotherYun.html"
5,E X C E L L E N T !!!!!,This book is excellent! Only pick it up if you have the time to read -- you WON'T be able to put it down!
5,The Heavenly Man (Brother Yun),"My wife and I have enjoyed the book very much, we give it a 5-star rating."
5,Most highly recommended book ever,"I couldn't put this book down. Reading it made me realize that my love, faith and works for the LORD are bellow zero in comparison to the Chinese believers'. Words can not describe how much I love the Chinese church. I am praying that their light will never go out. Westerners have no right to complain about ""church persecution"". NO right."
5,Wonderful and Amazing Testimony,"This book was an amazing testimony and easy to read. Brother Yun's story is like the Book of Acts--filled with miracles and the power of the Holy Spirit. I recommend this book to my friends and family and tell them about Brother Yun's life. It's a great book for anyone interested in the house churches of China, what it means to be a pastor in pressing circumstances, or learning more about how God works in believers' lives today."
5,A Hopeful Alternative,We in the West are faced with an onslaught of militant Islam. Suggested responses are military defense and diplomatic negotiation. Brother Yun and Paul Hattaway offer a third alternative. They picture a Christianity that is not afraid of death or imprisonment and that mirrors the New Testament teaching of loving your enemies and overcoming evil with good.Heavenly Man mirrors the Book of Acts where sometimes Christians rot in prison and sometimes escape miraculously.
5,Wow,"How close are the miracles of God. It wasn't until reading Brother Yun's well-written story that I finally had the realization that supernatural intervention takes place today, now. And God's intervention is not how most would think, want or expect. Most definitely, and phenomenally, the Father's ways are revealed in Brother Yun and his wife's commingled stories.This book is amazing, revealing, encouraging and alarming. It isn't about persecution. It will expose you to the actual plans and purposes of God."
5,Must Read!!,"This book will indeed set your heart on fire for the gospel. It will impart a vision for how we should live our lives by following the example of Brother Yun. You will be changed after reading his story. I am not one who is easily swayed, but this true story changed my perpective on life. Our small trials are but naught compared to the persecution of the Chinese Christians. Yet, they lay down their lives for the cause of Christ. It is truly inspiring!"
1,Cheaply Made,We picked this strap kit to try something new and this one looked good for beginners. Its comes with a small soft 4.5 inch dildo that tapers to a 1.2 inch diameter but is way to short for harness use. The 4 way nylon strap harness fits OK but will not hold in place or stay tight. The O-ring is NOT interchangeable for different size dildos so they tend to move around. Wished that the harness was better quality plus the jelly dildo was so cheap that it fell apart!
1,Don't bother.,"The harness was a fine fit, but the toy part was entirely too short and way to bendable. Save your money and get something else!"
1,not received,this item was was not received and was never order by me. I hope that whomever got this item enjoyed it very much
1,tinyyyyyyy,This thing is Too Small for actual fun!!! The harness is complicated for such a tiny thing! Flat out dont buy waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Does Nothing,"Even as a ""beginner"" this thing did nothing for my guy! I am hoping I can find something that will fit in the straps to make this purchase not a total waste."
5,And THAT's How It All Began Folks!,"I just received the Little Cowpoke CD, and have listened to it a few times in my car~~~ HOW ADORABLE to hear Chris,Sara, and Sean(and Scott, Chris's Dad) from way back when..... to hear them play instruments that young and harmonize beautifully all these years, made me feel good. I have always loved Nickel Creek,and I never realized that Chris made 2 instrumental CD's right after this one.... AMAZING! I was also happy to be able to meet Chris this year at Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival 2011, and I brought along his 2 CD covers for him to sign, I was in heaven, and Chris & Michael played an awesome gig, very tight.... THANK YOU CHRIS! I miss Nickel Creek but I know everyone needs to move on and do different things, but if there IS a Nickel Creek reunion one day..... YEE~HA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GREAT CD, for young and old(er)!"
2,Nickel Creek Origins...,"I purchased this CD shortly after finding out that Nickel Creek would be disolving their union as a band. I hoped that this collection would be suitable for both myself (as a strong supporter of Nickel Creek) and my two children. This CD honestly fails to deliver a suitable substitution for the music that Nickel Creek produced over the past 7 years. Although, I guess that was an unrealistic expectation to have for this CD. You have to keep in mind that the members of Nickel Creek were just children themselves when they released this CD. I don't believe that they had found their true musical identity, and they obviously wouldn't have reached their full musical potential yet. This CD isn't really the best for a todler either, so I have to say that this purchase was a let down overall."
5,Great CD for Little Kids,"It is not often that one can hear their favorite band singing as little kids. That is exactly what you get on this CD. Nickel Creek, known for it's folksy, soft melodies made this CD when they were all between 10 and 14. Now, if you are not into little kids singing high notes, then maybe this CD isn't for you. My niece and nephew love it. They even want to be cowboys someday too! If you love Nickel Creek, its worth it to get this CD."
4,Works Well.. No Surprises,"Had initial issues installing, but with a little help from google and an collegue who had done it before was able to install it and works flawlessly. No issues. Been running an my mini as a media center pc (perian quicktime plugin with front row)running 24/7 for the last 2 months. no issues."
3,Not a good experience,"After figuring out how to get at the memory in the MAC Mini I replaced the original equipment 1Gb of RAM with the matched pair. The machine would no longer boot. Unfortunately I was overly optimistic and had put the machine completely back together. I disassembled one more time and put the original memory back and the machine works flawlessly. I would suggest that if you want additional memory, order your machine configured that way."
1,Dead on arrival,"I had never heard of Crucial before this purchase, and now I know why. Despite trying it about four times, my new Mac Mini would not boot up with this memory installed. The Mac would boot just fine with the factory memory, but the Crucial chips: nada. Swapping back to the factory memory, it works. Back to the Crucial, nothing.My Mac is now running sweetly with the factory memory. This Crucial stuff is back in its box, waiting for a return.--- Follow-up ---I returned my memory for a full refund, and had the refund inside a week. So I have to give Crucial credit for customer service. Still can't recommend the product, though."
1,Nero User Interface Confusing,"Nero is not a good product if you intend to burn CDs with image files created by a digital camera. The Nero interface to accomplish this task is convoluted and confusing. In addition, you cannot create folders on CDs with Nero and the software often quits unexpectedly."
1,Will I ever get a copy of ANYTHING?,"I have tried to use Nero 5.1 and 5.5.10. I cannot get this thing to burn a CD or a DVD. I've tried to burn an image to no avail. I've tried other programs in conjunction with Nero like DVD Decrypter, DVD Shrinker. Either it doesn't recognize my CD or DVD, gives error messages in the burn process, or it will burn and not play. I've used Easy CD Creator to burn CD's with no problem. I've burned DVD's with DVD X Copy Express and Record Now MX with no problem. I've printed the manual and studied everything.I have a Sony DRU500AX burner with an AMD Athlon 1600 processor running on XP. I am not a newbie to computers. I have been a computer user for 25 years. I hear nothing but rave reviews about Nero, and I just don't get it. E:mail me if you have any suggestions, because I've tried to use this piece of junk on and off for a year and half now. NOTHING HAS BEEN BURNED. NOTHING. Zero stars..."
5,"The most powerful, flexible, easy to use, and reliable app","Hands down, Nero Burning ROM is all of the above - Maximum PC Magazine even uses it as their standard for rating CD-RW drives. After bad experiences with countless other CD burning apps, NBR is quite refreshing. Don't even try anything else - Nero is the best by far, and worth every penny!"
4,Very Pleased,"My Plexwriter 12/10/32A came bundled with Easy CD Creator. After making a dozen or so coasters, reinstalling the program several times and dialoging with tech support, I downloaded the free Nero demo 5.5 and became sold on Nero. It worked the first time. No coasters, and the CD's are burned fast, reliably and with excellent quality sound. The only drawback is the labeler is somewhat difficult to use, but a small price to pay considering the overall performance of the software. I am ordering the full version from Amazon.com, which includes the entire manual."
4,Good software that does what it's supposed to do,I use this and Stomp's RecordNow for most of my burning needs. If I am just burning Audio CD copies or Data CD copies I normally use RecordNow becuase it's what I started using first and the wizard for copies is just plain simple. The Nero software has what seems to be more options but also seems a little more difficult to wade through. I can't understand why anybody would buy this software for the retail price though as it comes bundled with many of the current CD-RW drives offered for less than the cost of the software. I purchased a HI-Val 48x16x48 Internal CD-RW drive for less than the cost of the software and it was bundled free inside the box. The software is good but use your money for the latest and greatest CD-RW drive instead and get the software for free.
5,Easy to use,"Easy to figure out and use. We have it at work and use it to burn data CDs. It's so simple, I've never even used the manual. Sure beats the socks off the other s/w out there. I'm going to get a copy for home, as I don't like the burning s/w that came with my new computer."
1,It Will Corrupt a Windows ME System.,"Most products that support Windows 95 & 98 also work on Windows ME. This product does not, although the manufacturer doesn't claim that it does work on Windows ME, they should provide a warning that it doesn't work on Windows ME, and not only doesn't it work, but it corrupted my system to such an extent that I couldn't recover even using the Windows ME System Restore functions. I had to reformat my hard drive and reinstall Windows in order to recover and then reload my data files from a recent backup. Be sure you have a recent data backup available before loading this software."
1,Product is just OK,"I tried Nero because I heard that it was supposed to be better than Easy CD Creator. I was not sold on Nero and found that Roxio has done a much better job at making a full featured product in Creator 6 so easy to learn and use.I will always be a Roxio Creator user now. They have total suite solution now for all your recordings Audio, Photo, VCD, DVD. Does Nero provide all this in one package - NO.You may not agree with me, but until you have tried Creator 6 you just wont know for yourself will you?"
1,Nero Burning ROM 5.5,"Currently using EZ Creator for my Iomega USB burner. Got 5.5 OEM version from Nero sales rep. Wanted to demo it on my ThinkPad 600x. Installed 5.5 on Win 2000. On the package, it clearly states supporting Win 2000. Unfortunately, when rebooting after installation, my PC could not boot up. There were multiple errors during boot up. Did not want to mess with it and uninstalled the software. Please beware. May need to stick with Easy CD."
1,grrrrrr!,"I bought this software for the ability to put photos taken with a digital camera onto discs for storing and sharing with friends and family. However, after many frustrating attempts I have been unable to create a photo-disc. The help feature was useless. The manuals, a waste of time. I would strongly suggest you consider any other product on the market if you want to make photo-cd's."
2,not good,I have been using nero for 2years and it decided to stop working when I use VCD. The Tech support is not good. The Problem i had was encoding video stop at 63%. I also decided to go with Roxio.
1,Never got it to work,"I have a btc 48 12 48 cd r/w and when I ran the software it said that it doesn't support the drive, although it's on their web site list for supported drives. Their tech support is non-existant there's no phone #'s and no one answer's the e-mail. The program was not user friendly, You had to run a different program for each operation instead of having a menu to pick from. Also you can't turn cdfile(Their drag and drop program)off from the sys tray or even stop it from running unless you know how to edit the registry file. And you have to have the Nero cd to uninstall it.(it wonn't uninstall from add/remove programs)I don't usually write bad review's about products but this one didn't make a very good first impression"
2,Ok but could do a lot better,"Nero is a good program. I was very thrilled with it at first but then shortly after programing it on my computer I began having problems with it. It no longer allowed me to compile my own CD and that was the main purpose of the purchase. Friends of mine have always had the Roxio program installed on their computers, they've loved it and so have I. For a relativly same price I'd rather buy a program that would actually work for more than two months."
4,Great product when it works,"I have been using versions of Nero since 1999 and generally it does a *very* good job - much better IMHO than EZCD, it has many useful options and provides good feedback.I have just however installed it on a Notebook with a combined DVD/CD-RW running XP and while it burns fine it now does not ""simulate"" at all.Nero's support are not the speediest to respond to new problems and looking at their site there are many ways to foul it up, I briefly had a TDK 32X drive that really did not get on with it at all well, yet my Wife's TDK 16X on an identical system with the same OS worked - go figure.In summary it is great if it works but it does not always work - I suggest you *try their Demo version first* before parting with any cash."
1,"""NO TECH SUPPORT""","I was looking for a program to transfer my old LPS to CDS. The program seems to be rich in features and short on execution. I was able to capture the music into a file using the Wave Editor program. However, when I tried to write the file to a CD the burning program could not read the file."
4,Nero,"For starters,Nero is not the best.Neither is Roxio or any of theother ones mentioned.They're consumer level burning rom.If youwant the best burning rom available you better save up some cashNero is, however,very good.I use on two computers,one running 98and the other XP Home.To edit,master and burn top quality audio,I use Stienberg Wave Lab 4.0,Wave Lab will run you $.Cake Walk Pyro will cost you $ and is better than any ofthose mentioned in the other posts.But Nero is good software andshouldn't be run down.I would get it over Roxio and Easy CD,butprofessional burning rom will smoke them all.You don't have tospend the $ for Wave Lab,there are other titles in the $-$ range that are extensive and do some amazing things. 3-27-03:I want to amendmy review and say I think Nero5.5 is better than Pyro.After pla-ying around with it,it doesn't have anything Nero doesn't andit takes Pyro too long to prepare the cd before it starts theburning process.No effects on Pyro either."
3,False statement about XP Pro and Roxio,I am running Windows XP Pro SP-1 and Roxio EZCDC 5.3xxx and have never had any problems making any kind of CD. I have no idea what other customer is saying about those 2 programs not working together.
2,Buyer Beware - Noooo support,"Nero has the potential of being the best, most user friendly burning software around. I've used a dozen applications over the past 3 or 4 years and Nero has the potential to be the best. Where Nero falls down is support. If everything works for you...great! If you happen to have a legitimate problem, one that fall out side of the FAQ, and self-help section of Nero.com, you're out of luck. There is no forum to get your issue resolved. Not only have you bought a product you can't use but you've spent hours trying to solve a common problem. If you are a basic user just getting digital files this may be the product for you. If you are a power user who may have files on servers, long directory paths to files you want to copy or backup you may want to stay away."
5,Works with Me Perfectly,"Whenever I read this many negative reviews about a good product I have to comment. Nero 5.5 is the best CD burner out there, much better than ""Easy CD Creator"" which is a true piece of junk.I installed this on three computers with Windows Me on them and they all worked fine. I build my own computers and can only assume that if you have problems installing this software you have something goofy with your system, and it is not the software itself. I have discovered while repairing friends' computers and upgrading them for them that usually it is some overlooked detail in the system that is actually causing a problem and not the software.This software is reliable, intuitive to use, and the maker is constantly tweaking it to improve it. I don't own stock in the company. I am a retired newspaper editor who has no vested interest in anything but the truth, which is why I retired...."
2,Great program if you never need support!,"This is a great program, well designed -- but hope you never have problems. I downloaded the demo for 5.5.7.2 and it worked great for me. I loved it -- so much so I bought it. And downloaded the latest version 5.5.8.0. Suddenly, the program claims my blank DVD-R disks aren't blank. It simply won't record on DVD-R (CD-R worked just fine). Ahead offers NO phone support, so you're left with their online troubleshooting guides. Good luck. Lots of info -- little solutions. Their online form for support threw script errors (it seems to be working now) and a week later, NO ONE has ever returned an email. IF YOU LIKE WORKING WITHOUT A NET THIS IS THE PROGRAM FOR YOU. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A WARM FUZZY FEELING THAT THE PEOPLE WHO SOLD YOU THIS PROGRAM WILL BE THERE TO SUPPORT YOU, LOOK ELSEWHERE."
1,Be Careful with OEM versions,"I bought this in an OEM version without any warning. After I've installed, the program do not work with my Sony IEEE1394 firewire drive. The message was that this OEM version is not embeded in your CD!"
1,Garbage,"Beware: on Win XP it treats all users differently so that I have a colorful spectrum of problems/conflicts with each user profile. There is no support and the instructions are a waste of time. The format is NOT simple, it's stupid and utterly without any class or effort. There is no support and this program only leads you into ways to waste more money. The ""quality"" label maker fits perfectly in the trash - more money schemes there as they give you few labels and 'offer' you a website where you can perchase more. This program is in my opinion a scam."
1,Waste of money and time,Could not even figure out how to burn a music CD. Have actually uninstalled the thing. Have used Roxio and this just does not compare...
1,Rip-off of the Year,"FOR remapping all my drives to different letters, minus 1 starFOR not doing what it says on the box, e.g. will not burn VCD or SVCD, minus 1 starFOR crashing every time ""cancel"" is pressed, minus 1 starFOR not answering emails to the ""support"" team, minus 1star.I should have known better after visiting the web site, its a mess. A mass of fixes and patches that says it all: this is flaky and unstable software.My advice if you are thinking of buying Nero? DONT."
2,My nero cd writer refuses to copy,Well sir/madam sorry to let you know that yuh product refuses to work in my computer an i was wondering if you could trouble shoot it or if you would replace it .It says it`s copiny an then when you check the cd there`s nothing on it .So could you please let me know as soon as possible ok . Well actually it was woking an there used to be missing parts of the cd when it was copied as if the cd was skipping. Thank You for your time
1,Manual Limited,"I purchased this software because the clerk at the store told me I could edit songs, which is what I need to do. I opened the instructions, before opening the software to read the instructions on editing. There is no reference to editing a song that I have ripped in the manual, that I can see.I have written to support from the website, but have not had a reply. Before I open the disc and destroy my changes of returning the software, I need to know if it can accomplish the task that I purchased it for.My review is... The manual and the support for this software are lacking."
2,Inaccurate and misleading title,"I think the music in this CD is very good, but it's NOT authentic Domincan music. I'd say only a few songs are truly from the island. Native Dominicans listen to different beats like bachata and merengue; they don't usually hear plena and guaracha. This is a poor choice of music to be represented in this CD. The title should've been something else, not República Dominicana. As I stated before, the music is good, but if you're looking for genuine Dominican rhythms, it's not the perfect CD to purchase."
1,Music you've never heard--for a good reason,"This CD claims to have the ""best music you've never heard."" It's not one of Putumayo's best.""Tranquila"",""Pegao de Que"",""Anoche"",""Immenso Amor""&""Lo Que Paso a Juan"" are catchy tunes;each one unique.""Tranquila"" counts as Latin easy listening.Unfortunately,most of the tracks sound the same.If you're looking for fun Latin music,get yourself a Bebel Gilberto album,or anything Brazilian.Putumayo's Brazilian compilations are flawless and a SURE THING when you're looking for,as Putumayo's CEO Dan Storper says,""All hits,no filler."""
2,"Good CD protection, bad design","I've owned the CD Steel Case for about 2 years. The steel shell is strong and durable, and ideal if you tend to treat your CD collection roughly. But it makes for a rather bulky, (not to mention very heavy) case.My main problem with this case is its poor design. When filled to capacity the interior is rather cramped, and it is difficult to flip through your collection. The detachable sleeves are a nice feature, but once again, when you fill up this case, the lack of space makes the sleeves virtually impossible to reattach. Overall, I would recommend this case for those who require heavy duty storage at the expense of poor cd accessability."
1,not what i thought it would be....silly me,i guess it wasn't written with me in mind....ggggeeeeeeeeeeeezzzzzzzi like the ONE religion or NO religion and ONE love!!
1,Mostly commentary.,This book is mostly commentary by Wayne Shumaker with very little of the cited works reprinted here. Some history and biographical information on the authors and a very few poorly reproduced pages from the original texts. This would be a good companion guide to the translations of the originals.
2,"Great collection, bad video quality","There is no mistake this is a great collection of classics cartoons by Max Fleischer. But it would have been great if they were restored digitally as Disney did with their Silly Symphonies. Some of the cartoons are blurry in some parts or too dark to the point that you don't know what is on screen. I wish this would have been explained in another review before I bought this set! The funny thing is that there's a docummentary that explains why a cartoon is missing and why the others are in so bad shape. If you like Max Fleischer, try the Popeye sets instead."
3,Pretty good compilation,"Despite ""OK"" video quality and rather vanilla audio commentaries, this is the only DVD I know of that took the effort to preserve these rare master works. Good for kids or animation collectors.3/5"
4,Max Fleischer's CC;s,"I really didn't know what to expect because these cartoons are in thepublic domain. I've seen these cartoons everywhere, but what drew me toto purchase these DVD'S were that they distributed by VCI ENTERTAINMENT. They did a pretty good job with some POPEYE cartoons I had purchased previously.I loved the set and what they did to try to cleanup the POPEYES and thisSOMEWHERE IN DREAMLAND DVD. I had completely forgot about some of thethese cartoons particularly HOLD IT. a hilarious classic, plus PLAYSAFE, HAWAIIAN BIRDS, and ALL'S FAIR AT THE FAIR. All in all, not bad.I applaude VCI for their efforts. Worth the money!!"
3,Great product.,These classic Cartoons help me bridge the gap between me and my kids. I'm able to share with my kids the awesome cartoons that I grew up with.
5,Great Purchase,My brother and I used to watch these cartoons when we were little and it was so nice to find this movie with a great collection!
3,fatal flaws,"I bought this player after reading many positive reviews, used it for a week and a half and then returned it (still waiting for my refund).Pros:1. Bright screen2. Good controlsCons:1. Skips back to the beginning of a disk when you hit a bump in the road...very annoying!2. Battery adds extra weight and awkwardly attaches to the bottom of the unit.3. With the battery attached I would occasionally have trouble powering on the unit. It would take me several minutes of button mashing to get the thing going. Seemed more like an operating system bug more than a problem with my specific unit.4. Sound was loud enough but had a strange quality to it. This was especially noticeable in intro music where the sound seemed to get softer, then louder for no apparent reason.5. Possible restocking fee and $18 out-of-pocket to return it. Better off buying locally.6. Vendor (Amazon partner) has very limited business hours and I waited on hold for a half hour."
1,Disappointed,"It was fine for awhile. We used only a few times on family trips. Then it quit spinning just after warranty expired. Not worth fixing. Bummed out , as this was supposed to be a good one and we've had good luck w/ other Toshiba products. I won't buy another though."
5,"nice portable, didnt last long","I got this for Christmas , read all the reviews in here and they are fairly accurate . The screen is a bit grainy for reading text ,but really its fine easy to watch a movie on , yes the drive is a bit noisy when it loads the dvd , quiets down after its running. The Battery last a long time. I do wish it would handle more formatsupdate 11-08 It's dead now 10 months would have done better at the pawn shop for 20 bucks. I would click on 1 star if it would let me"
4,Meets Basic Needs Competently,"Used primarily in Montessori classroom of 19 students, 6th thru 8th grades. Used to view educational dvd's, including lectures and documentaries. Often used by one student, with or without headphones. Sometimes, three or four students gather around. The Toshiba SD-P1900 does very well (video, audio, ease of use, durability) in this situation. Wish battery life were longer, but will usually make it through the day without requiring a recharge.I keep forgetting to turn the player off, and so more than once have drained the battery without realizing it. The on/off switch is on the side, and I wish there was a reminder warning of some sort."
1,Shorter lifespan than a poorly-fed goldfish,"When we purchased this 3 years ago the early reviews were good and we were pleased with the player portablilty and design, although the screen could have had a few more pixels. It's not been used often, but when we got it out of its case to let a friend use it in the hospital it played one disk and after changing DVD's it would not spin up and gave an ""Invalid Disk"" message. 5 disks later it gives the same message. Looking at some other reviews from 2008 on I see that's a common issue. Beware of picking up one cheap now."
1,Garbage,"Used four times, now out of warrantee and will not read disk.JUNK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,money down the drain,"we bought this dvd and worked somewhat well. 3 months later after warranty expired, It quit working. says that it can not read disc. took it back to the store where we purchased it and they ran diagnostics on it. They could not get it to work either. basically we spent 169.00 on a dvd player that worked for 3 months. the company nor any one else will help us unless we dish out 49$ for shipping and another 50$ for repairs. I could spend a little bit more money and get a brand new one with a more helpfull company that product may last longer than my hair color.not even worth one star."
4,Buy with confidence,"Pros:-Battery life is excellent. It does last up to 5 hours, and the lowest brightness setting (suggested in order to achieve the 5 hours of continuous battery playback) is NOT unsatisfactory, I usually set it between 0 and 8 (out of 16) and the image is still plenty bright (16 is way too bright for my taste).-It plays Divx files without any hassle. AVIs, MPGs, it's all good. No problems accepting any media. All my burnt media plays like charm.-The look of the player is indeed sleek, very high-end look.Cons:-Battery makes it a bit bulkier, but it lasts 5 hours so I won't complain much. The picture here doesn't show it.-I wish it had a slot for sd cards or a usb port for a flash-drive. Then again, that would make it more expensive.Conclusions:This player delivers what it promises and I'm extremely satisfied with it. The price I paid (just over 100) was way more than worth it."
1,Poor quality,"What a waste of money. This player never worked properly. Battery never did charge and Toshiba told me to send it back to them. I didn't because for my purposes I could plug it in. Then, although it was only used a couple of times, it stopped reading DVDs. It kept telling me to insert a disk when I already had one in. I expected more from Toshiba. I'm thoroughly disappointed."
2,Better the second time,"Gave this as a gift to my hubby. Imagine our disappointment when we tried to play DVDs and 4 out of 5 gave us a read error. DVD's we tried were fairly new. I called Toshiba was given a repair ticket number and I shipped it back to Toshiba (at my expense.) I had it back a week after Toshiba received it, whick I thought was a pretty quick turn around. Box it came in just indicated that it was 'repaired'. It is now working fine and we are very please with the viewing quality and ease of use. But in the back of my mind, I wonder how long this product will last."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"We purchased this DVD player in September 2007 with the purpose of using it to keep our daughter entertained on long car rides. From the start, we had problems with it reading the DVDs. This past September, just a few days over the one-year warranty end date, we called customer service to complain about the poor quality. Once again, we were on a trip and it wasn't working. Customer Service was of no help-we were told that we could send it in to be looked at for $100. That was the cost to send it in-to repair it would be an additional cost. This weekend, we again traveled and this time the DVD player wouldn't even attempt to read the DVD. This was a complete waste of money."
5,Excellent picture quality,I purchased this for my 6 yr old nephew due to its excellent picture quality and sturdiness.
4,nice little machine,"This is my first portable dvd player, and I must say, it's a better product than I expected. Easy to use controls, nice battery life, good picture. And I have not experienced the issues mentioned in other reviews, such as loud mechanism noise, or of having to ""bookmark"" where I stop. I watch a little bit of a dvd at a time ( over a period of days) and the machine always takes up right where I stop. My only complaint is somewhat tinny sound quality without the earphones. Other than that, I am most satisfied."
2,Bad picture quality,"This DVD Player has bad picture quality. Initially i did not want to spend a lot as i fly only 3-4 times an year. The look and feel of this product is better than lot of others available in the market. 10"" players are slightly pricey so i thought i will settle with this one. When i checked it in CircuitCity using a sample DVD they had, the picture looked ok, but after it arrived home i watched a movie that i watch in my TV and was dis-appointed to see how bad the picture resolution was. I immediately decided to return this one and look for better products. Philips PET 1002(10"") was best rated in the market. So I went ahead and bought it from Amazon and returned the Toshiba. I recommend buying 10"", anything less than that is too small and for a price difference of $55 between this one and Philips, I am happy that I got a better product and bigger size."
3,Works OK once fixed,The DVD player worked for two days. After that discs would not load or play. I sent it back for repair and have not received it back yet. I will write more once it is returned to me.So IU sent the item back for the warranty and they returned it to me about 1 - 1 1/2 weeks later. HAven't had any problems since. Volume on this is really loud so everyone can hear it good. I had to pay $11.00 to ship back to seller though. Other than that I have no complaints.
1,I'll Never Buy Another Toshiba,"When I first bought this DVD player, it worked beautifully. The drive stopped spinning after watching fewer than a dozen DVD's. Oddly enough, the drive stopped operating shortly after the warranty expired. I also have the misfortune to own the Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5895 Laptop, and the internal DVD drive in it lasted no longer than 20 hours or so before it, too, stopped working. Are you considering buying any product with a Toshiba DVD drive in it? Do your homework and check out all the one-star reviews for these products first. I wish I had."
3,works well but need improvement,"I bought this to use at the gym on a treadmill to make workout less boring. I watch a video and time goes faster. The only problem is the control buttons are the wrong color making them difficult to read for an older person... Unlike my previous one, it does restart where I turned it off which is why I bought this model.... That feature is a must..."
5,"Toshiba SD player; good value, works great","I have had this player for about a month. It has worked flawlessly. It plays both new DVD's and DVD's we have created. I bought it for my 7 year old daughter to take on trips. It is a little bulky, mainly due to the size (we upgraded from a 7"" model), but overall we are very pleased. The picture is good for a unit this size. We also have had no issues with the speakers or sound as we primarily use headphones to watch DVD's. I have not been able to test the battery charge time as we usually use the provided automobile power supply adapter."
2,A portable dvd player just ok,"I had another Toshiba portable dvd player. It was an amazing one. Perfect image. closed caption...The image of the sdp 1900 is barely ok. And there's not a lot of fonctions.Plus, the player refuse to play some disc...I'm desapointed but what to expect for 150 $ ?Buy something else"
2,junk,"I'm on my third one (heath/zenith is all home depot carries).On the last two, the outside transmitter didn't last longer than the battery. The first one's electronics died. The second one fell apart in my hands while I was changing out the battery -- the plastic had degraded."
1,VERY short life - a waste of money,"Like many other reviewers noted; this doorbell is a piece of garbage, a total waste of money.My doorbell button was located in the carport, completely out of the weather. It worked very good at first... even at a distance of about 30 feet, in a bedroom, without a clear line of sight.Mine lasted no more than 2 months:- it started randomly ringing, as if a ghost is at your door (get out of bed for nothing)- new batteries made no difference (expensive little things)- testing at short distance: still no goodSummary: It doesn't work at all now, a useless product on it's way to the landfill. I do NOT like throwing away money (chime & new batteries) So, here I go once again in search of a decent doorbell.Be well, Jeff"
1,Unreliable puts it mildly,"It seemed fine at first, right up until the return time elapsed. Sneaky thing. Well, almost fine. The battery sits a bit loose in the pushbutton unit, so when attaching it, the battery slid a bit and I needed to remove, adjust, and reattach. It worked. As I said, worked fine for a little over a month. Then it started working about half the time. Then it rained heavily and it started working all the time... as in ringing without being actually touched. Maybe something in the unit swelled? I had to unplug the receiver until things dried out.I've just changed out the battery in hopes of it working. I went through the ""adjust battery, snap in place, remove to adjust shift caused by snapping in place"" dance again, but then it worked. But after a few pushes over a few days, the battery has apparently slid out of place again. Off to buy one with a better rating."
1,Save your money,"Bought it in July, died in September. Probably would be OK for an indoor environment (buttons and receiver) but the buttons don't hold up to any kind of moisture - including dew."
2,Get something else,"This is inexpensive and had the chime sound my wife and I wanted. I'll leave it to other reviews to discuss long-term problems, I just now installed mine and it has worked three times out of three.The install process is from the ""we don't care"" school. There are indentations where the screws go, but you have to push the screws through the plastic - there's no hole or poke-away tab.If you want to change the tone - I didn't, but I read the manual - you open the doorbell unit and change jumpers! This is fine if you have spent time setting up hard drives, but strikes me as an odd process for a doorbell with a total of three (3) sounds to choose from. Similar doorbells use a button on the underside of the ringer to change tones from one sound to the next.The doorbell functions so far, the bell is fifteen feet from the ringer, but the workmanship is consistent with the bad reviews and does not fill me with confidence.I recommend that you buy something else."
4,Wireless Doorbell,I find it very affordable and no more missing people at my door as I am tone deaf and can't hear people knocking. The batteries are very long life and it is working great for me. Thanks for this wonderful offer.
1,Boring,"The Crown of Silence was a real disappointment after reading Sea Dragon Heir. Although there are a few fine moments, in general the plot and character development seem haphazard and uneven. The plot mostly seemed to consist of characters wandering around the forest or lakes looking for some ill-defined inner awakening and spewing half-baked philosophy. The compelling characters and eerie atmosphere from the first book are gone. I slogged through this one to get the third book."
2,Choppy waters with petulant characters,"I really wanted to like this book more. There were some good ideas but whenever it started to get interesting it would digress into petulant sulky inner dialogs or catty exchanges between the characters. It has a strong self-discovery theme but sadly that seems wasted as the characters never really seem to evolve, only switch who is their new best-friend.Constantine's writing flows beautifully and there are some wonderful images but any connection I felt to the characters was tenuous at best. By the end of the book the only character I cared to know more about was the indirect antagonist, Valraven Palindrake, and even he comes off as the bad boy in the clique that everyone either secretly loves or openly loves to hate.If you are into soap operas then you may find some enjoyment in the characters and story but for my taste everyone was just a bit of a drama queen."
5,Amazing piece of Fantasy Literature...,"This is a great sequel to the first of this Trilogy. Constantine has a talent for painting the landscapes of Magravandias in your head with precision and detail. I really enjoyed how Constantine told the Story of Shane and tied it into the big picture. Excellent book go out and buy all three, its worth the money."
5,Now Comes The Telling: Mod Gothic at its finest.,"Storm Constantine is one of the greatest of the great tale-tellers and this second volume in the series (and you really should read the first before you start this one) proves it. Just wonderful, brilliant material. I read this and Silverheart at the same time and was, as always, wrapped up in a wonderful, sexy dream. Definitely a Tasty Tale, recommended to all TT sisters! This is modern Gothic at its finest."
2,What you see is not what you get.,"The picture clearly shows a blaster handle with four ceramic nozzles.What arrived had four steel nozzles, which are inferior - they wear out quickly - and cost less than ceramic. That's pretty deceptive.I bought this primarily to get the nozzle holder - this entire kit cost less than buying just the one piece, so I gave it two stars instead of one because that piece was fine.Also, the black hose in the kit absolutely reeks of mothballs(?). I opened the box and then had to get it out of the house. It sounds weird but you really couldn't store this in the basement.In any case, if the seller is shipping metal in place of steel you can do better on the price, so look elsewhere."
3,sand blaster kit,There were no instructions with the kit and no way of getting the information.The Kit requires almost double the pressure that was listed in sales.I would suggest this unit be used by hobby people for a part time use. Thanks Kay
4,a good book,"This is one of the few books available that deals with the issue of compassion from a biblical perspective. If you're involved in ministry to the hurting, this book presents some good insights into the ministry of compassion."
1,A horrible soap opera,"I rented this movie because of Laura Linney, Gena Rowlands and Emile Hirsch. These three actors are terrific, but unfortunately they cannot save this sorry excuse for a movie. This only showcases how important it is to have solid writing. Rather than letting the audience figure out some things by themselves, the status quo of every character is spelled out in marquee-sized letters, sometimes in trite dialog, more likely to be found in an afternoon soap. Don't bother with this film. If you want to see a great movie with these stars, check out You Can Count on Me (Laura Linney), Hysterical Blindness (Gena Rowlands) and The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys (Emile Hirsch)."
3,"Not bad, but definitely not the best","It was a little too tongue-in-cheek for my taste. I prefer serious, no-nonsense stories and characters. I suppose what I disliked the most about this book is that the main character and his lover are the stereotypical gay über-affluent men that live in a huge gorgeous house, with time on their hands and money to burn. Not realistic enough for me."
5,Another GREAT Mystery,"Once again, Michael Craft has given us another wonderful, funny, page turning mystery in the lives of Mark Manning and Neil Waite. Each of his books is a joy to read and I for one can't put one of his books down without anticipating picking it up again to find out what happens next.Thank you, Michael for inspiring me with your wonderful stories of friendship, love and honor."
5,Another gift from heaven,I am once again blown away by the sheer awesomness of these Cambodian Rocks compilations. This is by far some of the grooviest rock ever recorded. I get giddy listening to this.
5,Just flat out awesome!,I am a beekeeper. I have tasted honeys from all over the world. This is one of the best I have ever encountered. Cute little bucket too.
2,Tiroler Herz,"I would love to tell you about this album, but I haven't been able to hear it yet. I listen to music through my computer since my CD player broke. When I tried to add it to my itunes through my computer I was told that it was protected against doing so. I have never been able to listen to it, and frankly I'm not happy about it. If I ""buy"" a CD, I should be able to listen to it any way I want to. Well, not with this album anyway."
5,Great Book!,I am a Sheltie breeder and am always looking for stuff to put into my puppy packs. This book is perfect! It has a great price (very important since I usually buy 10-15 books at a time) and it's full of color pictures and helpful information for the new owner of that fluffy puppy! I am back here again to buy another batch of these books!
3,quick starter,"This book has some really good ""getting started"" pointers for raising a puppy. I suggest also purchasing a more comprehensive guide (and I recommend ""Making Friends: Training Your Dog Positively"" by Linda Colflesh)."
1,"Dried, Burnt Fruit","Product was more work than it was worth. All the fruits have to be sliced paper thin, and you have to watch it the entire time it's drying in the microwave or risk quickly burnt fruit vs. rubbery dried fruit. The directions were little to no help with this product. They added up to saying, ""Hey, you're on your own!"""
3,Great story of an american icon,"Few Companies have survived as long as this American icon. What makes it fun is that it ends in a time when toys were coming back strong. 50 years later and now under the Hasbro name, Milton Bradley is the leader in the industry with even more titles to emerge since this book ended. This book needs a sequel."
4,Red Steagall CD,"Lone Star Beer & Bob Wills Music is a good track, but For All Our Cowboy Friends is a GREAT track."
5,This one works!,"This is a real non-stick pan! Everything stuck to the infused anodized pan like glue, but not this one. Heavy construction and cooks great!"
3,Eggs stick to this pan.,"This is a well made pan. It looks and feels good in the hand, BUT, it is NOT non-stick, at least for eggs. When I'm done making scrambled eggs it leaves a layer of egg stuck to the pan, just as much egg is stuck as is in my 8"" stainless pan. I have a larger Calphalon One pan (13"" or so) and eggs do not stick to it. I'm not sure what the difference is, but I know this one is a mess to cook eggs in. My wife has resorted to using the 13"" monster pan even to cook one egg rather than trying to clean this one."
3,"Good product, but","I have a set of Calphalon One frying pans. I needed to replace the 8 inch fry pan because the one I have been using for nearly 5 years was starting to show some wear. The new Calphanon One Infused Anodized on appears to be exactly like the one I currently have. Although the product is very well made, I notcied that when cooking the new frying pan, I am having a problem with things (frying eggs) stick to the bottom while cooking. It cleans up fine, but I did not have the same sticking issue with the older pan. I still like the new pan and it cleans up easily, I am a little dissapointed with the sticking issue. Maybe it will get better with a little more use."
3,it's all scratched up,"I've had this little pan for a couple of years. It heats quickly and evenly. It's very easy to clean except around the rivets. If I had it to do over again I wouldn't buy calphalon one because it has scratches all over it. I'm not a mad man, I don't dig into it, I'm middle aged, and I've used a lot of different pans in my time. This one needs plastic utensils or it will scratch. At some point in time I'll replace it because I don't like the idea of ingesting the coating, but I don't want to keep spending $100 on pans that scratch."
1,Poor quality product from Dewalt,I'm surprised that Dewalt would sell such an inferior product..... the teeth broke easily. Milwaukee produces a far better product.
3,should not have 16x16x1 in the title,"They work fine, but the description is correct, they really are 1/2 inch small. If you really need 16x16 in a ceiling return air filter, these will require a shim to stay in place."
4,Excellent Travel Guide,"Can be a bit dull and the background music leaves much to be desired; however, it is an excellent guide to England."
1,Worst Travel Guide Ever,Total waste of money. The photographer was more interested in swans and soldiers than actual sites. The music was really annoying as was the voice over.
3,Cute but cheaply made..,I bought these for my wife thinking they were black but they are really a deep purple. The embroidery is nice but they are extremely thin and made very cheap. They are made of like a velvet material that will not last very long.
1,don't waste your money,"This is a piece of junk. Poor quality materials and poor construction.Very thin metal, cheap coax. Tripod won't lock in position.Compared to D-Link DWL-M60AT signal strength is about the same although the SC803 is supposed to have higher gain.Buy from a reputable vendor such as D-Link or Hawking."
1,A Piece of Junk,Tripod dosn't work. Requires extra 40$ in equipment. Some of the equipment works poorly with Windows Vista. The free Netstumbler is virtually un-useable. Virtually no imporvement in signal or in finding networks if your are not in a hotspot center. Look for something else!
2,Problem with extended use,"I bought this dryer some time ago, and while I really liked it at first, a design flaw became apparent after using it for a time (probably about 6-9 months or using it under 10 times). I'm sure I'll get all the technical names wrong, but here goes - the part that holds up the dryer head is just a simple thumb screw. With time, it is ceasing to hold up the dryer head, making the dryer essentially useless. The head will drop down during a drying session often now - and trying to retighten the screw that holds it up while hanging onto a wet, angry cat isn't easy! Without the screw working, the dryer will blow air straight down - which I can't find a use for. I would think with the high price of this dryer, the mechanism that holds the dryer head in place would've been a bit more advanced."
1,Like reading a rough draft; very forgetable,"If I hadn't already read a couple of the books in this Hornblower knock-off series I wouldn't have finished AoV and I guess I shouldn't have. I kept waiting for things to get better. Honor doesn't show up as much (or as well) as I'd hoped and much of the book is burdened with political lectures and tell, tell, tell lumps of exposition. Where was the editor? Maybe the problem is that Weber is ""too big"" to edit, but golly this is a disappointingly bad book that will convince some folks to leave the series.If you've never read a Weber book, don't start here and if you're a Weber fan pick this up only if you gotta have the set. I gave my copy to the Glen Falls library book sale."
2,"A disappointing, grueling read.","I have all of the Honor Harrington novels and have re-read most of them several times. I doubt that I will ever take this one off the shelf again. None of the action you would expect from an action series. If critics are going to compare this series to the Hornblower saga they they should go back and read one or two of them. C. S. Forester, even in his off days, never failed to keep a story exciting. Ashes of Victory was long, tedious and boring."
2,Cardboard villains...,"... (especially the Manticoran ones), far too much exposition, a character (Honor's mother) that seem to have walked in the series from one of Heinlein's worse late novels, and many episodes that seem far too contrieved (especially towards the end). If one were to compare the Honor Harrington books with the Miles Vorkosigan ones, it would be possible see that in the former, the series is getting repetitive and far too wordy, while in the latter the main character is growing with each book. A pity, because I used to like the first Honor books."
1,Misfire!,I have to agree with Adam Bridge that Ashes is very disappointing. Only die-hard fans of the series are going to love this book; newbies will be thrown by the lack of a protagonist (or even a clear story!) and the huge amount of exposition setting up future books. HH is supposed to be space opera -- this is soap opera!
5,A new begining,While lacking in the battle action of former Honor novels it sets a great stage for the new Honor to expand her battle field more extensively into politics. It wrapped up many loose ends except I wanted more on Honor/White Haven. Still an excellent read.
2,Honorless Victory,"As a long-time appreciator of Weber's ""Honor Harrington"" series, I feel ""Ashes of Victory"" is an apt title for this book; it certainly left me with a desire to incinerate it. Weber deftly advanced many of the minor plot threads developing throughout the series and then must have become bored. Previous books in the series gradually fleshed out important plot threads involving the characters and government of the ""People's Republic of Haven"" (the enemy) which added faces and interest for the reader. Weber hints of important events unfolding and exciting action to follow - then skips it entirely in favor of a pitifully inadequate, miniscule, one-chapter summary of what could have been an climactic turning point for the series. The book fails to regain energy after that, ending with a whimper (both figurative and by this reader!)."
3,"Good, But not the Best","I agree with several of the other reviews in that the story spends a lot of time on substance and chat, but loses some of the normal tense action to long drawn out scenes that, in the previous books, would have been summed up in two or three sentences. There are many areas of the book where you get lost because there are details that you need and since you are not given them, you need to make assumptions about what did happen. There is good action, but very little with HH. DW may have to go back to the drawing board over this one. The project encompassed too much time and information and lacked the planning that we saw in the previous books. It appeared the book was rushed to press and vital information had to be left out or was not properly thought through. There was not a lot of detailed battle sections like the other books. Most of the scenes in this one, were straight slaughters. Please don't make HH a diplomat, she was great the way she was."
3,"Dear Mr. Weber, Have you no soul!","A necessary addition to the HH series. Unfortunately the middle (particulally the HH politics and tree cat anatomy scenes) was very slow. Weber needs to stear away from MAnticorian politics and technical achievement and return to the original theme - the navy. Having said this, I loved himself's Havenite vinettes and action at the end was great. However this is addressed to David Weber --- How could you do that to them? How could you do that to us? Have you no soul? What an absolutely evil and awful ending! I absolutely loved it!"
4,Very good overall,"""Ashes"" was very good, although not the best of the Honor Harrington series. Honor wasn't onstage as often as in previous books, but I think the level of attention she was given was appropriate to what she was doing. It's good to see that she's still maturing--becoming politically savvy and growing into her role as an RMN admiral. As for everything and everyone else involved--pretty good, although it moved a bit slowly at times. A few long anticipated events took place, e.g. Robespierre--er, Rob Pierre getting his desserts, the PN getting fed up, etc. And a few events weren't handled as smoothly as I'd like (the attack at Grayson stands out). Still, ""Ashes of Victory"" is worth the time and money, and I recommend nearly all of Weber's books."
1,Awful !!!,"This is without a doubt the worst book David Weber has ever written. I thought the previous books in the series were great, and luckily, the remaining books in the series are also good. But this one was a real stinker. The entire first 250 pages of the book is about lavishing Honor with praise and rewards. Each time, she is ""so surprised"", finds it embarassing, and claims she doesn't deserve it. This goes on for chapter after chapter - first on Grayson then on Manitcore. There is also chapter after chapter of ""witty banter"" between characters that is anything but witty. It is just silly and ponderous. If you are reading the entire series, there are enough important events in this book that you'll need to read it, but be prepared to either be bored to tears throught much of the book or be ready to skim through large sections of it."
2,Adequate,"This book is not as action packed as the previous books in theseries. There is a lot of wrapping up of the war and foreshadowing of the inevitable sequel.If you are into the series, you should probably read this book to see how things are wrapping up. If not, skip it, there is a lot of material that would not make sense to someone without the background of the rest of the series."
2,Not His Best,"David Weber is my favorite Sci-Fi writer. I am willing to give him a lot of leway. This book was a bummer from the begining. Honor is featured in the book, along with all the other people you love and hate. The ones you want to get what they deserve do and new bad guys come in for Honor to thwart. Mr. Weber has several directions that he can go in from here. If he continues the series for several books, don't be suprised to see Honor doing most of her battling in the political areana rather than in space with the RMN or GSN. I look foward to the next book to see if this series and Mr. Weber continue to warent my respect. Like I said, ever the optimist...."
2,A good series going downhill,"This is the worst one yet. Pages of discursive, repetitious prose, and going-nowhere conversations. All the good guys are cute and coy and teasing with each other, it really sets your teeth on edge, and there is no tone change so all the characters sound alike. The technical stuff is good and fun, but it really tells you a lot when you'd rather read about LACs and lidar than whether Nimitz will regain telepathy. And please, kill off Honor's mother or the next time she lowers her lashes demurely I may get very ill."
3,"Readthe 1st and last chapters, skip the middle","The newest installment was not worth the wait. Few surprises, fewer plot twists, little edge-of-your-seat action. Too much politics, too little of the hard fighting, fast action space battles."
5,Weber delivers again....,"Ashes of Victory is a little differently paced than Weber's other books but it lends depth to the series which is promising to be something akin to Tokin. This book foreshadows the greater role the Solies will play in future HH books and with the demise of the Peeps, who else can provide the macro antagonist the Peeps can no longer play? This book completes many of the story arches Mr. Weber spent earlier books creating. This may disappoint some readers used to the fast paced action but the speed bumps allow you time to appreciate the truly epic proportions this saga is beginning to grow to. Again, I can't wait for the next one. (And unlike Robert Jordan... Mr. Weber's books keep getting better.) A true find."
5,Ashes to Ashes,"This book is a must have for any fan of Honor Harrington. Although she is not the ""star"" of this book her character and Nimitz are developed even further, as are a few other characters. The ending of the book will have you cursing the opposition leaders. Then will leave you wondering just what IS coming. Which means that the reader is left with the question ""Now What?"" after all of the plot twists. Now for the real question when is the next book due? I want it now!"
4,Bringing it together,"IF you have read the previous books from Weber, here is the point where things focus again. This is the nineth book in a series, so tons of stuff is going on, and Weber tries to tie loose ends up, well mostly. The only reason I didn't give him 5 stars is personal preference on what scenes made the book. A lot of things happened, and only so much will fit. The reunion of the escapee's at the beginning was a little too maudlin, and for some that seems to set the tone. But if you skim that part, you get to the meat of the book. And a filling meal it is. Lots of loose ends tied, old villians dead, perhaps new villians on the horizon - who knows? If you read the first eight, then you have to buy this one!"
4,Turmoil exponential in Honorland--Gotta love the Chaos!,"Frankly, having read all of Mr. Weber's Honor books, I've found this one to be seriously addictive. Although the plots involved appear to be scattered like birdshot, they give a feeling of depth to the ""Honorverse"" referred to by another reviewer. The whole of it doesn't revolve around Honor, nor should it, in a work of this scale. There were enough cliffhangers left at the end of the book to assure hordes of slavering Honor addicts will be buying the follow-on books by the gross. It's good to see literature wherein strong moral fibre and dedication to duty are made to look desirable. Thanks, Mr. Weber."
3,"Good, but not the best","As an avid fan of Honor Harrington and her creator, David Weber, it was with great anticipation I waited for this book to appear at my doorstep. I won't go so far as to say I was disappointed, because I wasn't. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed the read and it felt good again to be reading fresh news about my favorite heroine. But... well, it's not up to Weber's standard, in my opinion. Perhaps he's setting the stage for the future, and the book did draw wonderfully from the past novels, but...If you love Honor, get the book. If you've never read her before, read them in order and you won't be quite so disappointed."
2,300 Pages Too Long,Mr Weber must have been paid by the word for this novel. It could have been a great read except for all of the padding. I guess Mr Weber's editor was on vacation.
1,The worst of the lot....by a great deal,"What an INCREDIBLE disappointment. Doesn't Weber have an editor? Or does Baen just publish whatever he shoves under the door? This is a work with almost no action, ENDLESS exposition and backfill, no well drawn characters, cliche after cliche, and a universe filled with either awful people or military heroes. Surely somewhere in Manticore there's someone in the Opposition who isn't self-interested, brain-dead scum. But that is beyond Weber. This book is so flat, so dismal, so self-inflated that there's no time to generate any interesting characters (although there are many places where we'd like to meet someone new and exciting).My recommendation: don't bother. Weber is tired, his universe is tired, and Honor is behind a desk. Declare a final and lasting peace and write something new."
1,ashes of victory,"I bought this book used and it stated that was in good condition, but when I stated reading it, it feel apart at the binding and pages came out. I feel this was not in the condition that it was reported, this book was in poor condition. I recommed this book for the reading, but the seller should have been more clearer about the books condition, it was not good it was poor."
2,WHERE DOES HONOR GO FROM HERE,I LOVED ASHES OF VICTORY. I HOPE THAT THIS IS NOT THE END OF THE SERIES. TIED UP A LOT OF LOOSE ENDS. STILL WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MANTICORAN ALLIANCE FIGHT A BIGGER FOE. MAYBE THE LEAGUE WORLDS. MAYBE HONOR WILL BE A DIPOLOMAT. WHO KNOWS. JUST DON'T END THE SERIES MR WEBBER
5,Excellent... again!,"This is a logical progression in the life of Honor Harrington. I loved some parts and hated others; and without giving any of the plot away, the best line in the entire book is the word ""Oops.""All in all it is an excellent story and I'll recommend it to anyone. My only complaint is that it'll be a minimum of six months before the preview chapters of the *next* book are posted on the publisher's website."
3,"For God's sake David, get on with the story!","This book was tedious to get through, to say the least. Don't get me wrong, I love character development, but this book goes way beyond that to painful, plodding, expositive diarrhea! Several times I just wanted to throw this book across the room and hope it landed with pages open to something relevant to the overall plot. Weber is a great storyteller, but in this book, it was like he wrote out a fairly decent storyline and then handed the book over to a computer, programmed with the text of his previous novels, to randomly generate proliferous puffery, in order to create a book of sufficient size to justify the cost! I truly want to follow through with the adventures of Honor Harrington, a very noble and compelling character, but I am not sure if I can plow through ""War of Honor,"" if it is as full of itself as this one."
3,"Still Honor, but from another point of view","This isn't the best of the series. On the other hand, I enjoyed the background as kind of a break from the war. Unlike some other reviewers, the sessions of Honor with the cadets were some of the best in the book. Having served in the military, it's nice to see even heroes get stuck with mundane duty. Also, much of it rings all too true for how ""politics"" plays into decisions. The biggest down side to the book is the ending. You're kind of left with the ""did I miss something"" feeling. The whole style changes from the earlier works and makes you wonder if someone else actually wrote the ending. HH is a great character, but you should start with one of the earlier books in the series and work up to this one."
5,From An Honor Fan,"I was introduced these books about three years ago and was impaitiently for this book. To be honest most of this was because of the whole White Haven-Honor thing. Unforunatly nothing happened on that front but this book is still great. The ending does leave a lot of questions about the whole situation between haven and star kingdom but that opens another realm of possibilities. Regardless, i will be waiting for the next one to find out how the white haven and other storylines turn out"
1,barely adequate,"I enjoyed each and every one of the Honour Harrington series - before this book but oh what a disappointment ""Ashes of Victory"" is compared to all his previous in the series.There are basically a couple of hundred pages were little of interest happens and then the enemy are killed in the last few dozen pages by an amazing new weapon. Honour doesn't even get involved in combat because she becomes a teacher for goodness sake!Only buy this book if your expections are low. I felt David Weber was selling this book based on his reputation AND I see from one of his most recent releases SHIVA OPTION he may be doing the same again.The Shiva Option is the fourth an final book in the series and readers have been waiting (with baited breath) since 1997 for this finale and for what another disappointment?"
2,Surrender,"I give up.The first three will always be personal favorites. After ""In Enemy Hands"" I had hoped for a revival, but this is terrible, easily the worst of the lot. It was actually a chore to finish. The predictability and heavy handed joviality has become remeniscant of a David Eddings novel.First Robert Jordan, now Weber... It's time to find another SciFi series..."
3,Weber needs an editor,"Yes, a lot goes on. And yes, there's a lot of incidents and changes in Honor Harrington's universe. But still...My biggest complaint is that David Weber's habit of sacrificing dialogue and characterization in favor of large, indigestible chunks of political manuevering and technology explanation has gotten worse as he's gotten more popular. A good fifth of this book could have been cut without a trace. I'm also very tired of being *told* how the characters feel and never seeing them *express* their emotions. Weber should know better by now.I read it, and it was okay, but the best space opera out there is still Lois McMaster Bujold, who knows how to write a scene about interstellar politics in less than twenty pages....."
2,ASHES OF VICTORY,I was looking forward to reading this book because I had really like the other Honor books in this series. But only 25% of this book was about Honor and the rest got all tied up in politics and other minor charictors that I was not interested in reading about. I was disappointed in this book.
3,Was there an editor involved in this?,"I've enjoyed this series from it's beginning, but I'm disastified with this book. Weber has become popular enough that Baen seems to have stopped editing him entirely.The three page exposition on why do-nothing, careerist navy officers resent warrant officers is a perfect example. It could have been done in three sentences, but because it rambles on for too long, it detracts from the more interesting things around it.Weber also drifts to far into cliche, and because of that, into predictability. As soon as you recognize the cliche, you know what the next 20 pages will be about.For newcomers to the series, please read the other books first. For fans of the series, keep your fingers crossed, maybe the next one will be better."
2,Dining on Ashes,"Looking over the reviews for this book, there seems to be a lot of die-hard fans who are as disappointed as I am. Judging by the voting on the reviews ('did you find this review helpful') people who disliked the book are in the minority, yet the criticisms voiced are, I think, valid. Major events are thrown away, with only passing references. Frankly boring plotlines are given page after page of numbing detail and I felt that this book desperately needed a firm editorial hand. It was too long, certainly, and with judicious cutting the pacing problems inherent to the book could have been dealt with - to a degree. I have enjoyed the series up to this point, and it is this enjoyment that will keep me reading. Let's hope that the next instalment is a great deal better than this lacklustre effort."
4,Not enough Honor! But still a fine read.,"Focus is not on Honor but several characters and plotlines within her universe. Not the least of which are the Peeps. This is a good ""bridge"" story for future books.Two interesting, vivid segments: Honor's thoughts while preparing to teach a classroom of eager young students and Queen Elizabeth eruption of temper with a group of opposition politicos. You can almost ""see"" Sigourney Weaver in the former and Angela Basset in the latter. Pity Hollywood cannot appreciate the potential of this series! It would take a young Spielberg/Lucas/Scorese hybird to pull this off!There's enough action to please most fans, but the real elegance here is behind-the-scenes skrullduggery. All in all I say, ""disconnect the phone, forget the remote and log off the 'net"", Lady Harrington is in the Building!"
3,Gets better near the end...,"This is, unfortunately, not one Weber's better books. Most of the first half could be summed up as ""Honor came home, and everyone was happy to see her."" He spends page after page on minutiae, like an entire chapter on the difficulties of teaching treecats sign language, and then neglects details like incredibly important battles and a highly significant coup attempt. Fortunately, he seems to back to his old self near the end of the book (just wait for Shannon Foraker's `oops!' or Thomas Theisman's little surprise at the very, very end). So, despite my disappointment when I started reading this book, by the time I finished it, I was right back to salivating for the NEXT one! Hurry up, David!"
2,Old Product,"Felovite II is an excellent supplement for cats, particularly if you need to add more taurine to your cat's diet. My middle-aged cat loves it and benefits from the vitamins and taurine. I purchased it for years at a local store which recently switched to all GNC products which are more expensive and -- more to the point -- the cat hated them. I was hesitant to order online because I was concerned about receiving expired product, which is exactly what happened. I ordered in January 2011 and received a tube that expired in JULY 2010.Five stars for Felovite II itself. Zero stars to NYCPETSUPPLY (fulfilled by Amazon), for unbelievably low standards regarding what you put in your cat's mouth."
5,Fabulous,"I was introduced to this perfume about 30yrs ago, and began purchasing it from a local department store. Unfortunately within a few years they discontinued selling this product and I couldnt find it anywhere. Now thanks to Amazon (and others like it) i can purchase it online. It is an absolutely fabulous smelling perfume. Love it, love it, love it."
5,Just love it,"Somthing I can't find easy anymore, so I was thrilled to find it.It's smell is sweet and I just love it."
3,No response from Sakiv - the seller,"I purchased the Yves Saint Laurent for Women, Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Oz. on November 5, 2012 as a christmas gift for my wife. The Amazon Marketplace seller was Sakiv Inc. Plainsboro, NJ.My order left Sakiv left their facility on November 6 and arrived in Warrendale, PA - that is just north of Pittsburgh, PA - I live just south of Pittsburgh, PA.Because of a very dirty address label it did not make the 20 miles south to me but made a 6 day roundtrip to Saint Paul, MN!I received the package on November 15 and gift wrapped it.Then a couple of weeks after Christmas my wife took the spray out of the cardboard box the spray can was in and discovered a large dent in the can.I then contacted Sakiv through Amazon website - they have never responded to me - not even a denial of responsibility!So if you are dealing with Sakiv Inc. you are taking chances!"
5,Rive Gauche,"turn around was great, cost was still a bit high but love the product. Will order again and again and again."
1,where is this bottle of Rive Gauche made?,"where is this bottle of Rive Gauche made?if China, or Asia, you know it's a bootleg.will Amazon tell us, where it's made?don't hold your breath."
4,A timeless scent,I consider this perfuume timeless because you can use it over over again and never tired of the scent it exudes. A good buy for the price I paid for.
3,Gift for my mother,This was a gift for my mother. It certainly is a more mature scent that is not readily available in stores.
2,Ok but not the best,"This is a dodge product,. the hole part is not metal. the bottom mount is plastic........................ .......... ....... ....."
5,HC album of the year,I listen to alot of hardcore. Hardcore is a way of life. If you had to buy just one hardcore album this year this would be the one. Keeping the old school sound and great hardfelt lyrics.Great CD!
2,Not worth the price,"I had high hopes for this mattress pad. It started out wonderful, but after a short time, the material traveled into the other squares. This left the sections directly under where we sleep without any stuffing, and all around us padded nicely with the comfy gel insides. We've tried throwing it in the dryer on the air setting with tennis balls to ""punch"" it around, but it hasn't really helped. I wouldn't have purchased this mattress pad if I had known about these results. I think the next time we purchase something like this, we'll try a memory foam mattress pad, of which we've heard much better reviews."
1,don't try to wash this..,"Yes, this product is wonderful UNTIL you wash it. I washed and partially dried this in my heavy-duty, front-loading machines on gentle cycle, and still the stuffing shifted from pocket to pocket, leaving the mattress pad with big lumps in some pockets and no stuffing whatsoever in other pockets. I returned the two I had in Atlanta. I have several more which have not yet been washed at my summer home. We'll see what happens. I am not able to change the star rating or I certainly would. Disappointing."
3,"Overall good, but needs improvement.","Overall my boyfriend and I are very happy with this topper, it does require some work, as in fluffing it periodically but we don't mind. What bothers me is the fact that we do have some clumping happening where the stitching to prevent it has come undone."
3,Just OK,"Ordered this for Halloween and the sizing was odd, didn't end up wearing...probably best to try on at store if you can."
5,Great everyday earrings.,These earrings are great for everyday wear. Post are long enough and the clasp is strong. Very pleased with purchase.
4,silver ball earrings,"It was on sale at great price, and free delivery.Very shiny pair of silver ball earrings. The backs are a bit too big for me, though. I prefer smaller backings, but overall, they're okay."
1,Faulty Clasp,"I loved these earrings, and at the price, I thought they'd be great. However, when I got them, I quickly discovered that the back for one of the pair was too loose to actually stay on the earring. Within two days, the earring had fallen out and I have yet to find it. There $15 down the drain!"
2,Nothing New,"Daryle's a decent singer, but he brings nothing new to these country covers. They sound like the original versions, only a little bit blander."
3,Good Music!,The CD is good and it's nice to listen to Daryle sing. I hope he continues to make more music and redo more oldies.
5,"True ""Country"" at it's best!","If you are young and have never had the privilage of hearing Merle, Buck, Kieth W. et al back in their hay-days, this one will get you there! Singletary's pipes are at their very best and dare I day that it sounds as good as the originals? Yes it does! Backed up by some great Honk-Tonk picking, this collection of classics is worth your hard earned dollar! Today's Nashville can kiss my grits, this is REAL country music!"
5,NOW THIS IS COUNTRY,"If you like Tracy Lawrence, Keith Whitley, Randy Travis and basically all of the REAL country singers. Go get this album now. Daryle has got the best honky tonk voice I've heard in ten years. But if you like the city, and Keith Urban and Trace Adkins and Rascal Flatts and stuff, then you might wanna stand back from this one, sorry but this aint pop or rock.IT'S COUNTRY!!!"
3,good for 3 years,"I am in the process of replacing the D98. I think I have a broken relay. The system was great bringing all the components together. Sound quality was average or slightly better. Plethora of feature usually found only on high end systems. Power seems slightly over stated. I was very happy with its value per feature. I hate the plastic volume knob that makes a scratching sound when manually changing the volume. I have reached the point where I will not cut corners for a great deal on paper. The D98 was a great receiver with poor manufacturing. I am paying for that mistake. But I think I got my money's worth, otherwise I would give less stars. I think I payed in the ballpark of $200 with speakers and a 50W sub thrown in at Fry's."
2,Nice! Until it breaks,"I bought this receiver last March and was very pleased with it until it just quit working. I thought...no problem, it's still under warranty, so I'll just get it fixed. That's when the real problems began. I happen to live in Anchorage, AK. and there is no authorized service center for Aiwa in Anchorage. I have been unable to access their Web sight for the nearest service center and their automated phone system continually disconnects. This has been going on for weeks! The reciever WAS great, but Aiwa USA needs to get their act together. I should have been suspect of buying another Aiwa product because I had a similar experience with Aiwa when I lived in San Diego, CA. I think I have definitely learned my lesson this time. NO MORE AIWA PRODUCTS FOR ME!!!"
1,25% Too Short,"What do you want out of an extension cord? It needs to carry electricity and it needs to reach the distance (perhaps without too much extra bulk). The shorter it is, the more important accurate length is.Well the cord comes up about 25% short of a foot. FAIL."
3,excellent item but dual plug is much better choice,"There are actually 3 different versions of these short cables and while all three types make it easy to access all the outlets on a power strip with transformers/AC adapters, this only only accommodates a single device on a single outlet.There is a version that can permit two cables to be plugged into a single outlet and another that has two female ends and single plug end. Both provide a lot more flexibility than this version - but this is the only one presently sold on Amazon."
5,It's what I thought it was.,Not much you can say about this. It's an extension cord and it functions. So far so good. The dimensions are correct to the product I received.
4,thick but good,i have no complaints. the extension cord works great. i just thought it was a little bit thick. thats all!
5,Just what I have been looking for,I had been looking for a 25 ft black cords for weeks. I use these with my DJ business. The only Black Cables that I could find were either 15 or 50 feet long. Now we get to the prices...always low economical and worth shopping on Amazon!!!
5,Simple Cord. Does the job.,This 10 foot extension cord gets the job done and the black color is low key. This is a good buy.
5,It's just a cable. But a good one.,"Hard to find anything wrong with this. Appears to be good quality. Exactly as specified, shipped quickly and it's fits the bill perfectly."
4,Good product,""" Haven't opened package yet but cable looks good and solid. Fully satisfied with purchase."""
5,great little cable,This cable works perfect for my jumper/compressor. I like the fact that it is only 3 ft. long as this is all I need. You can't beat it for the price!
2,Use caution if using with Kill-A-Watt - only rated for 10 amps!,"This product is fine if you are just using it to free up space on your surge protector or UPS that would otherwise be used by A/C adapters for cell phones, speakers, etc.However, this cord is only rated for 10 amps. Unfortunately that is not disclosed anywhere in the promotional materials. This means you can only use it for electrical loads of up to 10x125 volts = 1,250 watts. So if you were intending to use this with a Kill-A-Watt to measure, for example, how much electricity your refrigerator or microwave uses, well, don't do it because those appliances may draw more than 1250 watts and overheat the wire, possibly causing a fire.What is needed for use with the Kill-A-Watt is an extension cord that is rated for 15 amps or more. That will allow safe transmission of the electricity over the extension cord without overloading it."
4,Does the trick but a little expensive,"A little pricey, but this works well to get the extra distance you need and not a lot more. I am trying to reduce the wire clutter in my basement and using a 25 ft cable when you only need 10 ft does not help. This fit my need perfectly without a lot of rolled up wire sitting around."
5,Excellent power cord,used this cord as an input from my AV power protection to my in wall power for my HDTV. Works great....
3,Thin and stiff,I knew this cable would be thin based on the gauge. That's what I wanted so I could extend my vacuum's cord but still wrap it on the built-in cord keeper. My only real gripe is that this cord is pretty stiff compared to a normal extension cord. It's also a bit pricey. A regular extension cord may be a tad cheaper at Wal mart. But it wouldn't be this thin. I'm hoping with time it'll loosen up some.
5,Plugging This Extension,"I bought this cord when I bought the Energizer 84020 12V All-In-One Jump-Start System with Built-In Air Compressor and Power Inverter to keep it charged up. The cord itself seems about as thick as a piece of coaxial cable used for the TV. I was concerned that the cord might get warm while heating up the Duracel, but that hasn't happened.So for the money I am satisfied. Had thought about getting a three foot cord, but got the six foot to have more placement flexibility."
5,A MUST HAVE!,I bought this because and the power source because i was having problems with my vehicle. I bought the power cord extension as several people had suggested and I found it was really a necessity!
4,C2G / Cables to Go 03137 18 AWG Outlet Saver Power Extension Cord NEMA 5-15R to NEMA 5-15P (1 Foot/0.30 Meters) Black,"C2G/CABLES TO GO 03137 18 AWG Outlet Saver Power Extension Cord NEMA 5-15R to NEMA 5-15P (1 Foot/0.30 Meters) Black. I DIDN'T RECEIVE THIS ONE FOOT CABLE THAT I ORDERED, I RECEIVED A BLACK 6 FOOT EXTENSION CORD. I TRIED TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE FOOT ONE ORDERED, EXCEPT IN 6' LENGHT. THERE WAS NO LABEL SHOWING 18 AWG SAVER POWER ETC, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD CORD, SO I AM HAPPY. THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND IT ISN'T LIKE I ORDERED A 6' LENGHT AND GOT A 1' LENGHT AND IT ONLY COST A FEW BUCKS. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS, BUT IT WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED."
4,Good Quality - Cheap,"I payed ~$4 for the 3 foot cord - Much cheaper than the average hardware store.PROS: * Sturdy and durable * Not too heavy * Securely plugs into an outlet * CheapCON: Difficult to unplug something from the extension end - After a few attempts, this has become easier. If I had payed full price for this product, this factor would have made me return it.OVERALL, a good extension cord at a cheap price."
2,Are You Serious?,"The shipping time was good for this item, and the designs looked pretty neat. I'll give it that much. When I opened the package the butterfly designs were very dirty-like a yellow color getting very close to brown-in most places. I have a 2004 Chev. Silverado 1500 and putting this cover on my steering wheel was one of the most challenging things I have ever had to do in my life. In the end I actually had to use scissors and cut the stitch to get it on the steering wheel which, in turn, caused the material to tear. It's on the steering wheel very snuggly now though; I don't think it'll ever come off. You can just barely adjust it on the wheel. I'm keeping this cover for now, but if I had to do it all over again I'd definitely buy a different product."
2,some how dirty,Disapointed... dirty. I feel so bad it was a gift and the butterflies are yellow intead of white...=(
3,Unique Texture for a Steering Wheel Cover,"Only the butterfly portion of this cover is 'rubber grip' - the rest is a velvety texture. Another texture to note is that there are cubic zirconia / rhinestones within the butterfly print. It's definitely pretty and was worth the ten dollars to buy, but I will definitely not replace it with the same item when it wears out."
2,It hurts my hands,"This butterfly steering wheel cover looks nice and fits my steering wheel.However, there are a couple of downsides. First, installation was painful.It was really hard to get it to go around my steering wheel, the rubber did not have enough elasticity. I would recommend using some tool instead of bare fingers. Secondly, the butterfly pattern is a raised pattern with somewhat hard edges and they hurt my palm when I hold the steering wheel. Wearing gloves would solve the problem but doesn't seem like a good permanent solution."
1,Total crap! Even for 10 bucks!,"I can't believe anyone would give this product 5 stars!I WISH I had read the reviews! Like other people mentioned, parts of the white on the rubber were discolored to yellow. I also gave this as a gift and felt terrible when my girlfriend opened it. The rubber is REALLY hard. I don't believe it ""fits most standard steering wheels"" as the description claims. My girlfriend drives a mitsubishi galant and even when we put the cover in the dryer for 20 min or so to warm the rubber, it was impossible to stretch. We actually ripped the rubber in half (if that doesn't tell you something about the terrible quality!) trying to put it on.Furthermore, the rubber is incredibly stinky. You can smell it when you are driving and it makes your hands reek. It actually gave my girlfriend a headache. Seriously.I would pay 10 bucks to have the memory of this purchase wiped from my mind! Don't make the same mistake I did!"
1,TOO TIGHT TO STRETCH,"THIS COVER IS VERY PRETTY, BUT IS TOO TIGHT TO STRETCH WITHOUT TEARING! I HAD TO RESEW THE TORN SEAM AFTER I FINALLY GOT IT ON THE STEERING WHEEL! IT WAS A PURE MESS!! IT SHOULD HAVE THE LETHER STRAPPING TO SEW ON LIKE THE CHEAPER ONES DO! DUDH!!"
2,nice but...,"The steering wheel cover looks great. It's definitely cute but unless your steering wheel is 14 inches then I doubt it'll fit. I followed the example of one of the other reviewers and snipped a little on the sides of the cover in order to get it to fit. Oh and ""installs easy"" is such a lie. Also like many of the other reviewers mentioned the butterfly design was slightly yellow and dirty. I would choose another steering wheel cover."
3,didn't fit...,"it was too small for my steering wheel, but it felt really nice. good for those cold morning and the steering wheel gets cold."
4,Science Fair Live Saver!,"I used this book as a reference for a science fair project on the correlation between taste and smell and not only was it extremely helpful, it was fairly interesting considering the subject matter. Kittredge and her co-authors explain each sense in a nice amount of easy-to-understand detail. I'm not sure I'd read this book for pleasure, but for technical information it's great!"
2,Not very happy with my SS ball earrings,"I'm in the military, It hard for me to purchase items especially stationed overseas. It's always been easy to order from Amazon as always, I never had any problems. the earrings were beautiful but the post was very hard to remove from the earrings, when i pulled to remove the post while in my ear, the post broke off from the ball earring. I only had them for two weeks."
3,Good for a young audience.,"We love the visual presentation of fractions and decimals and the fact that so many variations are presented. The concepts are presented well so that ""equivalent fractions"" and concepts such as ""numerator"" and ""denominator"" need no further explanation. I still feel Rock 'n Learn videos are lacking in their 'engagement factor' with children. Leap Frog has a much more engaging way of teaching the concepts they cover. The Science Videos by Rock 'n Learn are moving towards that Leap Frog, story-telling, character based video learning style, however, the Math Rock 'n Learn videos are lacking that. Rock 'n Learn videos do have strengths in visual presentation of math concepts and in repetition of presentation, both of which are important."
3,"Kids like to watch, but no 'rock' in this 'Rock N'Learn'","My children, ages 6 and 8 1/2 enjoy watching this and the other 2 Rock N'Learn videos we got (Writing Strategies and Math Word Problems), but the videos are all too rudimentary for my 3rd grader, for whom they were purchased. My kindergartner likes them, and maybe what she's learned from them will give her a leg up when she has to learn these things. The strangest thing to me is that there is NO ROCK in these videos - not much music at all, really. What a strange thing to name your series!"
1,Misled,Vendor cancelled order without reasoning instead of honoring the price - and this listing is STILL on amazon 2 weeks later?
1,Product not as advertised,"This product states that it is a 5 pack, where as it is a one pack, contacted seller and they stated it was Amazon's falt. No matter this should be stated ONE Only. ordered three (5) packs as advertised, and only got 3 rolls of film, that was poorly packed."
5,A Truly Wonderful Book,"This book is one that is still near and dear to my heart, more than 18 years later. It's a simple, sweet tale that my mother read to me (and then I would later read to her) countless times before bed, but it's one that leaves you with a pleasant, satisfied feeling. It's almost magical. Its simplicity is what makes it so very endearing, and I myself would always dream about how delightful it must feel to sit upon a warm, freshly baked pie."
5,Salt Away,"My husband bought this for our boat trailer that we use daily in salt water. We also use it on our motorhome, helps with the spots on the paint and keep the slides working great."
2,Charlotte Church- Enchantment Video,"I am a tremendous Charlotte Church fan and very much enjoyed the Enchantment CD. However,this video of the concert in Cardiff was a huge disappointment. Not only did she sing off key, but her onstage persona was very much like that of a spice girl. She needs to work on her stage presentation if she plans to be viewed as a professional classical soprano. Josh Groban was wonderful. I am sorry to say that I cannot recommend this product."
5,Musical Elixir for the Soul,"After four albums and three DVDs, this being her fourth, Charlotte has really matured in her style and resonance of her voice. The music for the album of the same name had two new producers working with her, this allowed her to broaden her musical choices. Everything from a Spanish guitar on ""Habenera"" to the energetic beat of ""All the Pretty Horses"" (which ""was"" a lullaby).Her other albums and concerts are more classical and operatic. This DVD has more ""experimental"" music as Charlotte puts it. This is not to say there aren't songs from her usual classical repertoir. The concert has a lot of great flavor and zest to its pieces, the sound quality is excellent.Charlotte plays a few songs from earlier albums, the best being her reinvention from her original album's (Voice of an Angel) version of ""Amazing Grace"" to a more traditional classical tone.If you love a beautiful female voice this is a great concert DVD. I highly recommend it."
5,"Enchantment (From Cardiff, Wales Review!!",Hello.First I would like to say this is by far the best dvd yet!Charlotte has come along way sense voice of and angel.Her range of music and ever changing voice is wonderful!!I recommend this dvd to all music lovers.
4,enjoyable from start to finish,This was an enjoyable dvd to watch if you happen to likeclassical music and you have followed Charlotte Churchfor the past couple years now. You could probably buy thebest of and be just as happy.
2,Basic and Misleading,"I received the Uni 6.5 as a gift. I had previously owned the Uni 4.x (bought when Cybermedia still owned and supported it). The Uni 6.5 contains functions/programs that other programs (OS's, word processors, and even freeware) now perform. What I want the Uninstaller for is to move programs while maintaining their association with their other files, and to be able to see what other files use or are used by a certain file. Both of these features were present on the 4.x series. The latter feature is not present on the updated v6.5. Despite what the manual on the 6.5 CD states, and despite what the hardcopy manual states, the file association feature is not present on Uninstaller 6.5. The file association feature is now available on another NAI product; one that needs to be purchased in addition to Uni 6.5. This other product, again, has features that other programs provide as part of their cost. I have been dissapointed by Uni 6.5."
3,McAfee Uninstaller is ok,"After purchasing the McAfee Uninstaller, I found it to be helpful, but I prefer another brand that includes other options, and is a bit more simple."
1,Worst Spongebob & Worst Christmas Show Ever!,"My family all loves Spongebob, but this was the worst Spongebob and worst Christmas show we've ever seen. Not funny, but the look and songs are very irritating, and the songs are most of the show - very little dialog."
5,"Ok, I don't love it, but my kids sure do!","Instant classic we'll be watching every year. This is typical Sponge Bob entertainment, just in claymation style. You may be less than thrilled, but the kids love it."
4,The kids loved it!,"Our kids loved the movie. The only misleading item is that it states the video is 48 minutes. This is two episodes, so the Christmas episode is only half of that and there is another random Spongebob episode for the other 24 minutes. If you kids like Spongebob, they will probably love this one too."
2,Was disappointed,"the language is bad in this movie, not appropriate for my 5 year old. And was at one time cheaper on other sites."
1,Dont Bother!!!,"This was dreadful! Not only was it some sort of goofed up clay-mation (not an animated cartoon), but it was all about being a 'jerk' at Christmas! What a great message to send to the kids. Also, unbeknownst to me, this ""48 minute"" episode was only a standard episode length (~15 mins), with two COMPLETELY UNRELATED NON-CHRISTMAS episodes stuck on at the end!! What were they thinking? I wasted $5 on the HD stream for this, ugh. I'll know better next time!"
3,Very Very Short,"I got this today at Walmart... its a whopping 22 minutes long for ten bucks. There are a couple special features, but hardly enough to justify the cost. Should of been more like five bucks. Wait for december, it's bound to be on tv."
3,** Lack Luster **,"We LOVE Spongebob, but this episode had was a BIG disappointment.Pros:-The introduction AND ending by Patchy the Pirate & Potty was Very Delightful and cozy.-All the characters and props were done with wonderful detail & they did a great job of capturing the Christmas spirit.-We loved the claymation look to many of the cast and wish that more of these episodes ORA movie were done in this fashion.-The Santa from the parade was not as ""mutant""Looking as the main santa.Cons:-It would've been more natural looking if Spongebob, Patrick, squidward & sandy were not made of sponge material.-It's more harsh/violent than usual. The robot smashes a door on sqwidwards head & Sandy calls Spongebob an Idiot. The main song is called ""don't be a jerk, it's christmas""Overall, it's shy of 3 stars. To much singing. The Santa is a mutant who called everybody a bunch of ""jerks."""
2,Not the Best of Sponge Bob,"My kids are die hard Sponge Bob fans and we own every DVD every made. This was the most disappointing. It is fairly short, but considering the low price, that should be expected and if you read the description, it tells you how long it is. So that was not an issue for me. The problem was that Sponge Bob and his friends just don't work well as claymation characters. My kids just couldn't get into it. The one redeeming factor was the ""Don't be A Jerk"" song. That got a laugh out of them, but all four of my children lost interest in this version of Sponge Bob pretty quickly."
2,Don't be a jerk!,"Ok so I bought this for my 3 year old because she loves spongebob. I know from watching the spongebob shows that there can be some slightly adult tones in some of the episodes but this was over the top. Especially Spongebob singing ""Don't be a jerk"" and Santa Claus telling everyone that they were all jerks! What the heck? Now my 3 year old is going to think it's ok to call people jerks because spongebob does it. Not cool! If you are going to buy this, make sure it's for an older child that understands that it's not ok to go around calling people jerks. Definitely not a good show for a 3 year old lol"
5,cute,My son watched this over and over again. He was really sad when I told him we would have to put it up for the winter
2,not funny,"The claymation was a cute idea, but most of the writing was uninspired and not very funny. The whole thing was just very bland for what's supposed to be a special; they've done better Christmas episodes. This one felt forced and has none of the original goofy charm of Spongebob's first few seasons, before he was famous. Skip this and watch old Christmas themed episodes instead, you won't miss anything worth seeing."
5,another granddaughter must have,ok sponge bob how can you not watch the christmas special if you are a fan at any age ive cought my self watching the dumb thing
1,Not the cartoon I was expecting,"I picked up the Spongebob squarepants Christmas DVD to enjoy with my 2 year old son! I was very disappointed by the quality of this DVD as it's not the Cartoon as shown on Nickeloden. The DVD featured more like ""sponge"" creatures. My son would not even watch this. Such a disappointment."
4,Only about 22 minutes long,"Bought this as a gift and was a little disappointed that it was only about 22 minutes long (one episode), wish they could have put another episode on it."
3,For SpongeBob Fans,I bought this for my daughter who really likes this character and overall the movie was fine but I was a little bothered by the fact that it is so short ( less than a half hour) for what I paid I would have thought it would be longer.
3,Dead after 2 years...,"Purchased this product 2 year ago, and used it up to about a month ago...In a fine morning, I wanted to turn on my stereo system and listen to some music, however, no power! Monster Pro-3500 failed: voltage, current display failed! After opened the lid and some testing, I noticed all secondary relays failed...Moreover, the inside of this product uses only basic L-R-C filters, diode clamps, devices plus a digital multimeter and timers! Since I am a hard-core DIYer for about 20 years, I am kind of surprised by its internal circuit design.With the beautiful chassis and the PCB with ferrite cores, I can cut off 1/3 of the PCB (digital meter part), install a new 1KW center-tapped (60-0-60) toroidal transformer to make a balanced power supply with my dead Pro350, which will be a nice DIY project! For the price and the potential for DIY project potential, three stars for Pro-3500!"
3,This is my second unit (first one got electrocuted),"It seems this unit is better as a power conditioner than a surge protector. The down side is that is is not very good at protecting it self.I had a lighting strike about a year ago which destroyed my PRO3500 power center. I must say all the equipment connected to the power center survived, however the power center which was out of warranty was toast. $300 is an awfully expensive 1 time surge protector.I purchased another PRO 3500, but now I have a $30 wall unit surge protector in front of the PRO 3500.The upside is the Heavy case on the dead PRO 3500 makes and awesome case for a DIY electronics project."
4,Solid power,Bought this for my new DLP HDTV. So far have had no problems. It is designed to be rack mounted so it doesn't have any rubber feet underneath. I just picked some up at Radio Shack and it looks great on the new TV stand. If figured this would be cheap insurance for the TV plus it gives me 12 conditioned outlets for whatever else I need to plug in. Keeps power cords hidden better than standard surge protectors. Designed more for hi-fi audio applications but seems to work just fine for home theatre setups also.
4,Protect your investment,"I have my entire home theater set up powered by this device. The only downside is this item is made for professional audio, so the it is wider than standard components and will not fit in standard entertainment centers. I have mine stuck in sideways but at this price it is a small sacrifice."
3,"eh, do I really need this product? BUT check my update...","I purchased this product cause my buddy at work (who is an A/V guru) said I needed it. He says it prolongs the life of my ultra-pricey TV and surround sound system. It was pennies compared to what I paid for my TV and other equipment, so I figured why not.Now I just say to myself WHY?Update: Ok it has been one year later and my attitude has changed...This product saved my $1800 HDTV, my $800 receiver, and my precious PS3. We had a huge lightning storm and were hit with a power surge. Well, let me tell you my mini-fridge, which was not plugged into this unit, was fried. The compressor almost blew out the back of the fridge. It was crazy. My electronics plugged into this Monster unit? Perfectly fine. They were plugged into the same wall socket and everything protected by this baby is fine. My fridge, well it is toast :("
5,Hooray Marsha!,Rotary Cutting Feathered Stars!!!!! What a GREAT way to go. What a time saver for us. Everyone NEEDS this book!
3,Mapless,"This book will occupy a welcome niche among my collection of hardbound Napoleonic Campaign literature. The historical verbage is concise and the designation of troop movements are accurate and apparently well researched and documented. My principal criticism is relative to the sorry state of the maps located toward the back of the book. Not only are the maps few, they are practically illegible. The original map keys are not provided and handwritten explanations are meant to suffice in leiu of the original map keys. I personally believe this to be a disservice to the student of military history and an annoying shame. If you have no objection to a significant dearth of geographic reference material, you are likely to enjoy this read."
4,Good price,The product was excellent for the price. The only thing that may have been displeasing was the cracked edge of the container that I imagine occurred during shipping.
3,Progressive Music from the Old School,"This CD surprised me. It sounds a lot like Lou Gramm or Shadow King. There is tons of clean guitar and a few too many ballads to be a truly good Foreigner release. Under the Gun and Bad Dog are rockin' good songs though. If you need to decide between this release and Shadow King, buy the Shadow King CD."
1,I can't tell you how worthless this album is,"I saw the Mr. Moonlight tour back in 1995 when they came to Wichita's West Bank Stage. They did play maybe three or four songs from this worthless album, but they also weren't playing all their hits very good either. Really, it's a waste of tape to be quite honest. I can't think of any of the supergroups that were hot in the 70's or 80's that made albums in the 90's and later that have made a good album, except, maybe, a handful from Dio turned the trick. ""Hey all you classic rock groups, think about hanging it up if you can't make something really good"". Okay? Just steer clear of Mr.Moonlight!!!"
4,"If you're not a fan yet, YOU WILL BE!","English guitarist Chris Standring's project, ""SolarSystem"" released prior to ""Velvet"" is funky for those who like funky acid jazz. Then ""Velvet"" was released in 1998 and shed a whole new light on smooth jazz style...breaking the mold. Now, after two years, ""Hip Sway."" This is a SPECTACULAR project. Chris and his band expertly blend the sounds of smooth jazz synthesized keyboards accompanying incredible harmonica and saxophone, a never-ordinary beat, and of course the Chris Standring signature sound coming from Chris' infamous Cremona Sunburst Robert Benedetto custom archtop guitar (with a little echo-plexing at times)...ahhhhh... it's an unforgetable musical experience! And...a bonus...Richard Elliot guests on the title cut! Smooth Jazz LOOK OUT! Standring's got a new one and he's hot!"
5,Cool cool cool,This is a really awesome all-around ambient CD. The music is great and very smooth. If you like electronica and techno - this is a terrific addition to any house or ambient collection.
5,"Great music,great visuals",The music is great and the visuals are fantastic. They blend human shots with imaginative animation well matched to the music. This is my favorite DVD.
2,NO NO NO!!!,I just got this dvd and have watched it from start to finish.I am deeply dissappointed. I am giving it two stars because musically it is brilliant - but one could purchase a CD for that and not a DVD!!! The presentation is so artificial that it just disturbs the same main moral of this opera - that natural is best - overdoing it is just destroying it!Very sad.
1,poor charge retention,You'll be in big trouble if you're going on a vacation and don't have your charger. There is no way that these batteries will hold a charge for two weeks - even with minimal (or no) use. They can't save a charge worth a hoot.
3,Great in some ways...,"I found this book both good and bad. The software looked a lot like the GRE, so I was familiar with it when it came time to take the test. The actual test wasn't broken up like it was in the CD, which really threw me. Overall, I guess it was helpful, but I don't know that I'd recommend it."
2,MAC users beware,"While the book is rather helpful, I haven't gotten my money's worth because the CD-Rom is defective. After numerous hours with the Kaplan Tech support, I've come to the following conclusion, if you own a MacIntosh and are looking for technical support from Kaplan, you are sorely out of luck. Although I've tried running the CD-Rom on different computers, they are still not wiling to admit that there is something wrong with the CD-Rom, rather than all the computers I've tried. It sounds like the CD-Rom is helpful....if it will run on your computer."
4,It works but Kaplan is a little too frilly,"The Kaplan book/CD-ROM helped me increase my GRE score by 300+ points. I was pretty impressed. The CD-ROM comes with tutorials (that teach you the strategies in the book) and a multitude of tests. A couple of things that I didn't like about the CD-ROM include: 1) The tutorials try too hard to be cute and cool rather than making the most of your time; and 2) The section tests (verbal, quantitative, analytical) don't give tangible feedback after you're finished (i.e. you don't know what your GRE score would have been for that section). But, hey, my scores are up by a significant chunk of change so I can't complain."
1,Extremely disappointing,"The ""Kaplan System"" of study for the GRE is comparable to the purchase of the Brooklyn Bridge. Rather than provide one with a synopsis of rules for grammar and arithmetic (which one might use to refresh one's memory from classes long since past) they provide a system by which one can hope to, virtually, guess correctly. This book may have been useful if the practice tests had been functional, but their use of Neolithic programs forces one with a ""up-to-date"" computer system to reconfigure it. Having viewed the material in the book, this would only continue to fuel my disappointment in their attempt to provide any useful information. I'm not sure what any of the other ""help manuals"" provide, but it certainly cannot be any worse."
2,There is something wrong with the CDROM,"The book is mostly about test taking strategies. It also provides some practice tests along with list of vocabulary, which are not indicated whether they are adjective, noun, verb, etc(!). Additionally it gives info about self-confidence, calmness, etc in exam. Do not expect to learn many new things here. It mostly helps you do the best out of what you know already.And the CDROM, dam% cdrom. i installed it twice and its sound has defects.. i do not understand it.. it is like a broken record.. secondly, it gives you the feeling that software will crash any moment..hope it is helpful!"
2,365 recipes kids LOVE to eat??,I would say that about 5% of the recipes I would even eat. There are a lot of bizarre recipes with some random ingredients. Basically it's an okay book.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book has a good first chapter that introduces us to George Sanders. Then it quickly degenerates into an endless round of chit-chat about Brian Aherne, Benita Hume, and others in that circle that don't really interest me. I found that I'd been reading along for some dozens of pages and the author wasn't actually talking about Sanders anymore. Obviously, it's false advertising to call this book the story of George Sanders. You really have to find a copy of Memoirs Of A Professional Cad instead, which is unfortunately out of print and seems to have become a rarity. Marilyn Monroe's autobiography My Story also mentions Sanders in one of the chapters."
1,AWFUL !!!,"By obtaining this book I was hoping to learn some information about George Sanders. How wrong I was. This book is about Brian Ahern's friendship and correspondance with one of Sanders's wives, Benita Hume (B-O-R-I-N-G)!!! Do not waste your time or money!"
3,About George Sanders,"But not what I expected? It didn't get really good until later in the book. There was just too much written about Brian Aherne's career. I got a little bored. But he did give a good account of what George Sanders was like as a good friend, although they were totally opposite personalities. Nice stories about Benita Hume and many of her letters of correspondence are included.Good pictures too. Think I'd rather read Memoirs of a Professional Cad...George's personal bio."
2,Not enough about George Sanders just letters from BenitaHume,"I am glad I picked this one up first. I did not see this as a real bio on George Sanders. It had pages on Brian Aherne's life. I found this to be not needed. The majority of the book is letters from Benita Hume(George Sanders wife) to Brian Aherne. I wanted a meat and potatoes bio on George. I suggest not wasting your money. You will only get bits and pieces of George. I am sure Brian meant well ,but it just did not turn out well. I am now reading George Sanders autobiography. I will let you know how that goes."
2,"Why can't I order a ""large"" size?","So I'd really like to buy this shirt. Every time I click ""L,"" it says it's available, yet as soon as I add it to my cart or Wishlist, it changes to a size Medium. What gives?"
3,THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN!!!,"THERE ARE TIMES TO READ SERIOUS, THOUGHT-PROVOKING BOOKS---THEN THERE ARE TIMES THAT YOU JUST WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED.THIS WAS A LOT OF FUN TO READ---PAGE AFTER PAGE--VERY INTERESTING.THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS BOOK WAS---THE AUTHOR SPLITTHE WRITING OF THE BOOK TO THREE OF THE CHARACTERS---THEY EACH WROTEDIFFERENT CHAPTERS FROM THEIR POINT-OF-VIEW. VERY INTERSTING!!WHERE'S THE KINDLE VERSIONS?????????????"
3,Slow Plot....,The plot protrayed in the book revolves around only a handful of people. Read it if you have the time... otherwise a rather disappointing mystery story ...
5,You'll fall in love with Laura Hunt,"I watched the film on the French TV on a sunday evening and bought the book on the following day. It's really a tremendous plot, a good old detective novel. You'll identify yourself with the girl or the detective. Read it, or you'll miss something. As great as the best Ellery Queen, William Irish or Mary Roberts Rinehart."
4,Good old fashioned murder mystery. Wow!,"Nothing's changed really. Oh, the scene perhaps, the clothing worn, and the vernacular. However, the crime is still murder even though this one occurred during the 1940's. I found myself watching the movie and decided to read the book before I viewed the ending. I was surprised by the actors chosen to play the parts (They were not as I imagined.) and also how closely the plot was followed in the movie version. There were a few editing errors but the story of ""Laura"" by Vera Caspary is written well and it kept my interest throughout. It's a real mystery too. And now I'm ""dying"" to watch the ending; I can't wait to see who done it."
4,Great begginer book,"I am just learning photoshop and found this book to come in very handy. The format is easy to flip through and refer back to when in the process of working. Sometimes it's hard to tell from the small illustrations what the effect or outcome is, and it dosen't answer all questions, but in general I thought it was very useful for the begginer."
3,MAC OR WINDOWS?,"I have yet to try yet, but the book's pictures are all MAC screens...did I get the wrong book?"
3,It was okay,The book started out interesting but I was disappointed with the ending. I guess I was expecting more because of the title.
4,4 stars,"This was the first book by this author that i read and it was pretty good, I would read more. It ended a little weakly, but the rest of the book was good"
3,Not my style,"I read the whole book but not as enjoyable as I thought, not what I thought from this author. Should have read the sample first"
2,Good mystery but.....,"I purchased this book for the mystery not to hear the continual homosexual inequalities. At this point will not buy anymore of her books I know where to go to read, or discuss, political views, discrimination, etc and it is not in the mysterys I enjoy so much"
2,Convoluted,"Reasonably well written and the story had possibilities, but the author rambled in many places. Part of the story dealt with the unreasonable dislike of some people for a homosexual lifestyle, that felt too old fashioned for the rest of the book. The characters were wooden and hard to understand. The end was too neatly tied up and the last-minute romance for the hero was unbelievable."
4,Liked it,Liked this book very much. Surprised really at how good it was. The cover gave nothing away and I liked it also.
2,"Interesting subject, dull presentation","The author manages to hide an interesting story in a dull book. It reads like a scientific paper. No doubt the author knows his material, but he can't tell an interesting story. The history of Athens during the time of Socrates and Pericles has all the ingredients of a spell binding saga, but the professor's detached style conveys almost none of the excitement. Danald Kagan's book, ""Pericles of Athens and the Birth of Democracy"" is much more interesting."
4,Nino Rota's tender magic,"It is always a wonderful experience to listen to Nino Rota's soundtracks, specially when the music was made for a Fellini's picture. In this CD's particular case, the recordings are great and the mood of the films was preserved by the orchestras.There are only two reasons why I don't give a ""10"" mark to this CD: 1) in one or two arrangements we find a kind of artificial (""non-Rota"", I would say) use of electronic instruments which were not used in the original recordings; 2) the greatest piece of music found in the picture ""Prova D'Orchestra"" - the opening theme, to be more specific - was not included in the album, for some obscure reason. But these are small details, I would say. The album is great.As to the delivery service, no problems at all. I thank Amazon for its speed and professionalism."
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this rack to use in my garage to keep bikes safe from falling over. The picture shows what appear to be 26"" bikes parked in the rack. It is not large enough for the wheels to fit on 26"" bikes, more like for 20"". The rack itself is very nice but will not fit my bicycles so I will be returning it."
2,Rusty out-of-box; returning,"I'm returning this rack. Numerous parts of the rack were rusty, right out of the box. Box seemed fine, didn't appear that it had gotten wet or anything.I set it up (and got my hands very dirty from all the rust rubbing off: certainly wouldn't want to pack this up with my car camping stuff, which was one of its intended uses), and noticed that the powder coat was already scraping off. I suspect any of this units would start to get rusty if left out in any type of weather.One other word of caution: I don't think this would work very well with kids' bikes. There's nothing that would keep small wheels in the slots.Gave it two (instead of one) stars since it is heavy duty, holds full size bikes securely, and folds up as advertised (although it was very stiff due to rust)."
1,bike rack,"I wouldn't buy this again. It says for 4 bikes, really only works with 2 anymore than that & bikes are falling over. Not worth the $."
2,Nutrimax yogurt starter did not work well,"The instructions on the package say that the yogurt should set in 4 hours. I followed the directions carefully, but it took over 10 hours to set, and I ended up with a very thin yogurt. I have made yogurt before using store bought yogurt as a starter, and it always worked well. I had also tried the Eurocuisine starter and it also worked well, although I did not like it very much because the yogurt was a bit tart. This Nutrimax starter was quite disappointing."
2,Be aware of price and lack of support,"I bought Endnotes not realizing that as a student I could have gotten the product for 1/3 of what I paid for it. I had no way of knowing from the advertisement. It is a very expensive piece of software! It is also difficult to use without an inservice, so it has not been used much by me. I am waiting to meet with an instructor for instruction. This is disappointing. I can't give it a higher rating until I learn to use it."
3,Beautifully Haunting !,"This is a classic euro cult thriller from Jess Franco that definitely belongs in every fans collection without a doubt. Some very beautiful cinematography,great score & also some great body language acting from Franco film regular Soledad Miranda(Vampyros Lesbos). ""She Killed In Ecstasy"" is not perfect & definitely has it's dated flaws,the end could have been done better/more realistic,but these problems don't do much harm to it's all around haunting beauty or the core of it's morbid/creepy premise."
1,You people have got to be kidding.,"I'm thinking the only appeal this thing has is the result of those having viewed the ""shocking"" material as an adolescent and are nostalgiac for that moment. If it's kitschy humour, well then... I admit that while that is not my favorite thing anyway, I found it to be too poor to be funny (except maybe for the soundtrack). I can't believe the cinematic and acting kudos being thrown about. In all fairness to the rest of you, though, this was an experimental look at a ""genre"" for me - I shan't go there again."
4,worth it for the score alone!,"what can you say?that great double act Jess Franco and Soledad Miranda(Vampyros Lesbos) togethor for another euro-trash orgy of murder,cheap thrills and that music! psychedelic lounge heaven!if your interested in Franco,Miranda or just euro-trash in general then this films no Vampyros Lesbos, but it IS for you. the last film Soledad made before her fatal car crash.a must have."
4,My favorite Franco movie.,"This film is a sister-piece of the better known ""Vampyros Lesbos"". It has much of the same cast, the same beautiful scenery and the same funky soundtrack by Manfred Hubler and Sigfried Schwab. But ""She Killed in Ecstasy"" is better paced than the longer ""Vampyros Lesbos"", and in my opinion a better movie. This is my favorite Jess Franco movie."
4,Cinematic masterpiece by Spanish director Jesús Franco,"This is another cinematic masterpiece by Spanish director Jesús Franco. It's groundbreaking for its time, and the carefully orchestrated psychedelic imagery is very intense. I also recommend ""Las Vampiras"" (Vampyros Lesbos).Jesús ""Jess"" Franco (born 12 May 1930 as Jesús Franco Manera) is a Spanish film director, writer, cinematographer and actor. His career took off in 1961 with his cult classic The Awful Dr. Orloff, which received wide distribution in the United States and England."
3,Soledad makes it worth it,"I saw this film after watching ""Vampyros Lesbos"" and I must say this one lacks the quaintness and lightness of ""Lesbos"". This movie is more violent and lurid. In terms of plot, it's the standard "" I will avenge the death of my spouse"" that has been done better in other films. Luckily it contains another amazing, sexy performance from Soledad Miranda. And she alone makes this movie worth it."
2,OK until the end,"Soledad Miranda is fascinating to watch, but a car that slides down a hillside, gently comes to a stop on the beach, and then bursts into flames? I felt like I was watching a Simpson's cartoon."
2,"42 years later, the glitter has faded.","This review will be a bit different. This movie is from 1970, which I like, but is very slow paced by todays standards. There is some female nudity, but no male nudity that I recall. The sex scenes are very mild, I wouldn't even give them a ""soft porn rating"", but I'm sure, back in the day, it was quite risque'. Most of the violence or killings is mild , or the act is done off screen so you don't see it being done. They wouldn't even show her husband slitting his own wrists. Soledad Miranda does have a wonderfull body, and you do get to see it from time to time [ just not enough ]. So, for historic value it is just fine. For erotic value, not much. For blood or gore value, very little. Runs 74 minutes. The transfer to dvd was pretty good, no scratchy or worn out spots. My copy would not allow me to use the English subtitles, so I watched it in German. It didn't detract from my viewing pleasue. 2 1/2 stars.l"
3,old book,not much use for myself. my boyfriend is Greek and he found the words and pronounciations are very old style.
5,My favorite part of the book,"I found the description of what to expect in a treatment session especially helpful. I just started chiropractic treatments recently and, even though I did not go to one of the practitioners listed in the guide, I still knew exactly what to expect and felt more comfortable starting treatment. Thanks you for relieving some anxiety!"
3,Sophisticated looks. Average sound.,"I was looking for a louder sound than my current plastic door chime (that comes stock in most houses). I saw that this one had 2 ""brass"" tubes and thought that it would produce a much louder sound. To my surprise, the ""brass"" tubes are actually plastic and have little to nothing to do with the actual sound of the chime.Inside the wood casing, lies parts that look identical to the old plastic door chime it is replacing! -just 2 metal bars that are striked when the doorbell button is pressed. Luckily, the sound itself was louder than the old one, but not by much. But you can't expect much at this pricepoint.If you are looking for a basic chime with a sophisticated look, this one is great. But if you are looking for one that is loud, and has ACTUAL BRASS tubes, you probably need to look at spending twice as much."
4,A great book for those that wish to know how it was done!,"Ernest Seton has written a wonderful text to get lost in. The book could serve so many different people, from the young boy wanting to know the ways of the wild to the senior citizen who either wishes to broaden their knowledge of the forest. It would be a wonderful book to those people that wish to become 'instant experts' on surviving in the forest. The topics are broad: from how to identify trees to how to skin and tan different animals."
5,1921 Book of Woodcraft Reprint,"This is a reprint of the 1921 edition of the Book of Woodcraft by Seton. It is delightful to have a commercial edition of this work available again, but I am somehwhat puzzled over the title change.It is all here, almost everything that one would need to start an outdoor youth group. Details on camp setup, games, woodlands ethics and Seton's Blue Sky philosophy. Includes many sketches by Seton, probably the best wildlife artist of his era."
4,An awesome reprint!,"This book has LOTS of interesting information for the beginning and experienced camper. My 7 year old son and I enjoyed reading through sections of the book.For those interested in Native Americans, the story of ""The Ending of Dull Knife's Band"" is a phenomenal account of a historical event that rarely makes the history books. I would encourage interested readers to read this section alone.happy reading! :-)"
5,This is the best cookbook ever,There's not a bad recipe in this book. You can make any recipe for guests without a test run. No need to worry that it won't work or taste right.
4,Glad to find the Betty Furness Westinghouse Cook Book!,"I had one of these cookbooks that I got from my Gramma, I often used it and the pages were tattered and torn, pages fell out and I tried to make sure I didn't lose any but it got increasingly harder to use. I decided one day to check online and I found one on Amazon and ordered it. It's so nice to be able to find one that was in such nice shape. I'm very happy with my purchase."
4,Betty Furness Westinghouse Cookbook,The one cookbook I got was great. The shape of it was wonderful. The other one I received I was disappointed in. It was really worn. I just wished I know which one was which.
5,Best Foot Toy for Conures,This is my Jenday Conure's favorite toy - they are getting harder to find but he is so excited when I do get an supply of them for him to enjoy.
4,A journey back.,"For railroad and narrow gauge fans, this is a great resource. Not just a picture book (although there are plenty), this delves deeply into the rich history and operations of the old two foot gauge railroads. Great stories, lived by interesting men and women. Give it a read!"
3,"Better titled as ""World Religions In Protestant Perspective""","A Beka is strongly anti-Catholic and strongly anti-socialist and extremely pro-American and pro-Protestantism.""The recent exposure of David Barton's misrepresentation of American history is an embarrassment to the Christian world. But David Barton is not alone in cherrypicking historical facts and straining for connections to portray the United States as a Christian nation. The problem crops in in World History and worldview courses as well."" ~Cathy DuffyThis completely applies to A Beka."
1,I hate happened...,"Ordered this book, never received it. Someone in customer service must be asleep as I usually have great service from you!"
5,Jerome Clark got it right............,I agree with his extensive review and whole-heartedly agree. I remember Andersen from the 1960s in NYC and caught one performance live. Three cheers.
1,My Name is the Real Rating for This CD,"Embarrassingly bad remakes of 60s era folk sings. I couldn't decide what was worse - the ponderous singing, or the uninteresting electric guitar arrangements of tunes better suited to acoustic treatment. A particular lowlight is the comically bad rendition of Bob Dylan's ""A Hard Rain's a Gonna Fall"", which is painfully stretched out to over nine minutes. The liner notes, which elevate 1960s folk singers to the status of gods, add to the leaden effect of this CD. For boomers whose craze for nostalgia has completely overwhelmed their ability to recognize quality music - which this isn't."
5,Great Book,"This book contains a lot of knowledge...If you want to be a structural engineer or just love structural analysis, get this book...As for the book, it can as used, so I was not expecting it to be in good condition...But it was exactly the book I needed and came in good condition...very satisfied!"
5,One score and seven years ago...,"This book from 1973 is still a classic for little ones learning about letters and words. This book was a favorite of mine when I was learning, and I was so glad to find out that it is still available. My two-year-old daughter loves Richard Scarry books, and will no doubt greatly enjoy this one. In this book, Dudley the Pig detective and his cat partner look for letters of the alphabet. Each page is for a different letter, in alphabetical order; on each page, there are multiple words containing the designated letter. All of the designated letters are red, except for one. The child must find the one letter written in black. As with all Scarry's books, the pictures are great and engaging, and the characters are lovable. I highly recommend it--it certainly made an impression on me."
2,Not the Usual Richard Scarry,"I was very disappointed in the format size of this book, though I should have noticed this in the Amazon preview. I was expecting the large format book. The print size in this book is not at all suitable for the age group for which it was written.Otherwise - the usual Richard Scarry harum-scarum fun."
5,Find your ABCs,"Our three year old grandson loves the book, and it has enhanced his interest in learning the alphabet."
4,Great for little kids!,"This is a good book if you have young children that are anxious about starting school. It's cute, cheerful, and gives a positive spin on what may be the first real traumatic experience your kids have. There are stickers included, and you may want to place one somewhere in your child's belongings as sort of ""reassurance"" that's everything's going to be o.k.."
1,disappointing,"The greatest let-down of this tome, is not the notes which are quite well done and a great edition to students research libraries, it is the fact that they admittedly use alternate versions of words (other than in the actual text of L. and listed in an index.) I see why they called it Leningradensia and not Leningradensis... it is very different from that tome, because it is not the same text. However it now adds another text for comparison in my research, so there is that."
1,my mistake,"I ordered the BHL thinking that I was ordering the standard critical text. When I realized I actually wanted the Biblia Hebraica Stutgartsensia I wondered if this would do instead. It will not, as all the critical notes are in the back and not on the pages of the text. I am an instructor in a class on Biblical Hebrew and this was one of the required texts selected by the Professor. I returned the BHL and ordered a BHS. There IS a difference."
2,The Percussionist ruins it,I don't know what they were thinking with this percussionist. Most of the time it's just inappropriate noises but one of his instruments sounds like fingernails on a chalk board . Stella By Starlight is the best track. It's all bass solo (the only one) and no percussion.
4,Hold on to your hats!,"Even though the title says Peter Black's life is Boring, nothing could be further from the truth. Once you start reading this book you won't want to put it down. I was waiting for a real slow spot so I could put the book down and get some housework done. I didn't find any real slow spots and now my housework is lagging. Occasionally I tripped over a word or two but that's okay, because the pace of the work really kept me energized. Things change quickly in the book so hold on to your hats! It reminds me of Douglas Adams `Hitch Hiker's Guide' books, as in it has that British comedy tongue-in-cheek style."
4,"Entertaining story, so-so editing","First off, I really liked this book. What's stopping me from giving it more stars is a number of editing mistakes in the text. Once you get pass that, it is an interesting and entertaining piece of prose."
3,Early Iowa times,"When one approaches Granville, Iowa, there is a sign reading: ""Home of Black Soil."" This book was published in 1930 and supposedly is laid in Granville, though the true name of the town is not mentioned in the novel. It tells of Tim Connors, his wife Neill, their children, and Sheila, who lives with them. There are blizzards, grasshoppers, pioneer hardships, and a reasonably happy ending. This is not really a good book, but anyone interested in early Iowa should read it. Roy W. Meyer, in his book The Middle Western Farm Novel in the Twentieth Century, published in 1965 by the University of Nebraska Press, says of this book: ""The chief distinction of Black Soil is that it, almost alone among farm novels. deals with a group that consists chiefly of Catholics, the Irish and German settlers of northwestern Iowa."""
5,WANT IT NOW,I saw it when it was on PPV and LOVED IT...I can't wait for it to come out on home video...All the guys looked soo good and I also can't wait till May 18 when their new Cd comes out
2,Horrible Sound Quality - Uninteresting Concert,"Bought this DVD for my wife for Christmas. We watched it once and gave it to Goodwill. The sound quality is the worst I have ever heard for a concert that was filmed in the last 10 years. Definitely NOT worth getting on DVD. Not worth owning at all, really.The camera work is good, but the actual performance is only average. Definitely a group of talented guys, but this particular show is fairly boring. It was shot a couple of years ago, so maybe they have improved their stage presence since then.Unless you are in the BSB target market (i.e., a teen-age girl) you will likely be disappointed with this DVD. I recommend buying their Greatest Hits DVD instead and wait for a better quality live performance DVD from them."
5,BSB ALL THE WAY!,This video is sooooo great! I love watching all of their incredible dance moves...especially SEXY A.J! If you like BSB you have to buy this video. It's soooo incredible. I must have watched it 50 times!
1,Worst DVD on the market!!,"Choreography was very disappointing. Backstreet boys were wandering on stage like headless chickens. One of the worst DVD on the market. If you want to see how a concert is done, I highly recommend N'Sync live at the madison square garden...Lets put it this way I threw a tomato at the TV!!"
3,"It's ok, I guess.","I have seen 3 Backstreet Boys tapes. I have two of them and my freind has this one. She is obsessed with BSB and loves the video. I am a big fan and I guess it's ok to watch once. I saw it twice and was board the second time. Most of the songs they sing are good, but you can't hear them on all of them. The fans are screeming so loud you can't make out a lot of the words on ""That's the Way I Like it"" and ""Let's Have a Party"". That's all I remeber that you couldn't hear, but there is probably more. Your best bet is to borrow it from someone and find out if you like it before you buy it. If you want a video with a really good concert though get ""A Night Out With The Backstreet Boys"". That is a really good video."
5,THE BEST,"This video is soo awesome. I watch it everyday!! If you are a BSB fan then YOU SHOULD GET THIS!! It RULES! You will end up dancing, singing and laughing along the 5 hottest guys on this whole entire earth. If you don't get this you are absolutly NUTZ!! If you are like me and love AJ or maybe even know who AJ is then you should get this. If it weren't for this video(or my friend who introduced me to BSB) then i would not love AJ as much as i do know, thanks to his solo(AJ lovers out there, he humps the floor hehe). Get this or you are wacko. Until next time cya kids in the movies. Hugs, Kisses and Cookies, AJ's Fan 4 life, -Bone Luver-"
2,a rather disapointing video,the backstreet boys are great but i was a tad disapointed by this concert. it was a bit too typical.. i hope there next one will be better! KTBSPA
3,Worh having,I first rented this DVD but due to the many songs and the high energy performance of the Backstreet Boys felt this was worth buying and adding to my collection of concert DVDs.
4,Protest for the Backstreet Boys,I'm really annoyed to see some of the reviews. They pointed out that the vocal of the bsb is poor. The vocal of any band n artists should not be judge through juz listening to the dvd. Maybe the problem lies on the quality of the dvd n not the artists! Anyway there is no doubt that the vocals of the BSB is the strongest and most beautiful one!Those that does not believe should listen to more music before being able to judge who vocals r weak or strong!
3,It could have been better,"I love BSB but I thought that this concert would have been better. The stage was plain and there were no big elaborate dance routines. I was very impressed to see them playing instruments and singing ""Quit Playing Games With My Heart"" at the same time. It seemed like there were a couple of mini-concerts cut and pasted together. There was no continuity to the show at all. I felt like I was missing something, at the end of every other song they would have a finale, then come back on again in s different oufit. I'm hoping that they come out with a better show next time."
1,LIVE?,"No Talent, spoon fed, manufactured groups done sing LIVE so i can imagine how lame this is and everytime the Backdoor boys take the stage."
5,How to spell Presbyterian,"Concise, easy to read - one of the best I have seen in clarifying the mysteries of denominational liturgy/theology. Well worth the price!"
5,Heavenly music,"Jivan Gasparian introduces a piece of the Armenian culture into the world with his every record. I guess, what is so particular about this album is that the tunes contained on it are not only beautiful in the musical sense, but also very painful to the Armenian people. Listen to the ""7th December, 1988"", the day of the terrible earthquake in Armenia... thousands of people dead, thousands buried underneath the fallen buildings of Gyumri and Spitak... The day the nation will never forget. And here flows the sad, painful and still... such a heavenly melody from Gasparian's duduk with a voice singing beautiful lyrics..."
5,Sturdy. Good as an ice scoop.,"We use this scoop as an ice scoop in our freezer. Dishwasher safe. The ice doesn't stick to it. Good size and sturdy. The previous ice scoop was metal, and the ice was always sticking to it (and it wasn't dishwasher safe). So we love this one!"
5,Perfect Scoop for Inside Freezer,"Purchased this for our new refidg with bottom freezer containing extra ice basket. It works like a charm, is sturdy, just the right size and the handle is not too cold. Great deal. LTE"
4,Useful little scoop,"This is the 2nd OXO scoop I have purchased (1st one from Bed, Bath & Beyond). I use them in my large flour & sugar containers for baking. They have been very helpful. Might not work for you if you have smaller canisters. If so, Tupperware has a nice scoop that is smaller size."
5,Perfect For The Ice Bin,I use this in the bin of the ice cube maker. It is sturdy and is the ideal size to transfer ice from the bin to a glass. It is comfortable to the touch and can stay in the ice bin when not in use. The best feature is that it is convenient and prevents grubby little and big hands from grabbing ice cubes.
3,not bad,"Enjoyed the shape and size of this. Unfortunately, it cracked after I used it to break apart some ice. So partially my fault. Back to metal scoop with plastic handle for me."
4,It is not only passing the exam,I beleive that these books are not only for passing the exam but also for learning what is need in those subjects. I used these books and I pass the four core already. I plan to buy the other ones for the electives too. In these books they show you screen shots which are not needed in the exam but you need them if you need to work with W2K products.
1,Just as useless as all Exam Cram series,"I have been buying Exam Cram series books as a last resort just before my MCSE/MCSA tests, when I knew I would have no time for a more substantial volume. With every new book, I was getting more and more disappointed. This one was the last straw. I have barely opened it, and now it's for sale.All Exam Cram series feels rushed to print, and this is no exception. There are numerous typos and factual errors, and content is laid out in the most illogical fashion possible. Sample test questions are really basic and in no way mirror the real Microsoft thing. There are virtually no case scenario questions.I have switched to Microsoft Press official prep guides now and they are worth every penny."
1,Is not compatable,I would like to review this dvd but cannot because it is coded for the UK/europe region and does not work in Us dvd players
2,Horrible print,"I definitely would have rated this little book a lot higher if it weren't for the absolutely horrible print. It made me just about see double (my eyes aren't the best, but even so . . .) The drawings are great and the few descriptions I read interesting, informative, and, at times, humorous. The other books in this ""history and Americana"" series look interesting too, but I'll be darned if I'm going to spend money on something that is so frustrating to read."
3,Revolutionary Medicine review,"The book should have focused more on the medical . And, if you want our feedback, try not to order us to write a certain number of words, since we are using our valuable time to do this anyway."
4,Good purchase,"Acting, plot and effects are all high quality. Blu-ray picture and sound are also excellent. I will watch this one again!"
2,A long movie without compassionate punch,"Unlike some Western war movies that a) pack a punch in 1hr 45min, b) have a script that promote and demand a compassionate response from the watcher, I was sadly bored to death by this movie.It may be due to the translation, it may be due to the social and cultural differences between Korea and myself; though I have many excellent Korean movies. I just didn't feel moved by this movie in the scenes that were obviously contrived to do so. The acting, script and direction just flopped. Yes there are scenes with arms coming off and blood spurting, but that's not what makes a god war movie; that only adds a sense of realism for all you armchair soldiers who have never felt the pain of combat (and that includes me).Sorry, I just don't agree with all the hype this movie gets, it really isn't worth 5 stars."
1,KIMSHEE!!!,DONT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU SPEAK FLUENT KOREAN!!THE AD SAYS 'DUBBED IN ENGLISH' BUT IT IS ONLY SUBTITLED!!!IF YOU ARE READING THE SUBTITLES YOU MISS THE FILM :((
2,Wait for this one to come out on TV....Not very good.!!!,"This movie sucks, that's my opinion & I have seen lots of Movie's .. So it's about a war that most of us don't know to much about...This Movie was made by South Korean and they do notdo a good job making movies....Maybe thy should stick to making Cars........LOL.......I will not waist my money on this one....I got 35 mins into the movie and I stopped it.....Maybe it was the bad reading the sub-Titles or the bad mouth movement,,,,,,,,I just think it is a very poorly made For-in movie......"
5,"War as it is, in all its brutal and insane reality","This is an excellent, cold, cruel, realistic war movie quite free of most sentimentalism that demean thecold and cruel realities of war. War is shown here in all its grim, non-sensical and insane reality. Menare killed for the posession a mere hill of no value. Korean cinema can be excellent and this is a greatexample and this movie has to be rated as one of the very top War Movies we have seen. It deserves5 stars and no less than 4 1/2. Strongly recommended !"
1,Way Different SVH,"When I read that they where doing a new SVH series I was so happy! I've read each book and loved every one. But now I am turned off SVH:SY. I found by reading just that one book, SVH has changed way too much. You now have Jessica Wakefield unpopular- with all her best friends against her. To many new characters that are ruling out old, loved ones- like Todd, Winston, Enid and Maria (They weren't Even in the book at all) And to much changes- Like Elizabeth's new look at life, wanting to dress more sexy and re-think her decision about sex. I'd understand if they slowly made changes, but by making all the changes all at once it's too much. Why would they change such a great series like SVH, into this stupid series like SVH:SY??"
3,Todd?? What ever happened to him??,"What ever happened to Todd?? And all the old characters?? I really missed all of them, and most of all, I missed Todd's appearance and closeness to Elizabeth, those 2 really makes a good couple, they were together since Middle School! Really wish that those 2 can reconcil together again....."
2,I rushed to buy it--but it was DEPRESSING!,"WHY DOES FRANCINE PASCAL THINK EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EXTREME! In the OLD series, everything was peachy keen. Now, in the NEW series, every single person's life is wrecked and they are all completely different. The book was interesting but NOT WORTH READING because it was so depressing. I am glad that it gets more optimistic later, but I have read up to book 10 now and think they MAJORLY need to get rid of the Conner and Liz thing, or get a WORTHWHILE guy for Liz to like!"
4,good book,"I've been reading Sweet Valley High books for years. I liked Can't Stay Away very much. It seems more realitic then before. But there are some disiapointing things~ first off whats with the new covers? They look really boring and I liked the other ""Jessica"" and ""Elisabeth"" better. Also why wasn't Lila, Ken, Todd, Enid or Marie hardly every mentioned?? While it may be a good thing that the twins don't have a perfect life anymore, I miss all the magic of before! Remeber those great books when Liz and Jess were working as au paris in France?? I wish they would bring that back up!"
4,A good set up,"Although I do agree with that it is a very good book, its a set up. This book could definitly not survive on its own. It does not have enough plot. But it does have a relly good build up sequence."
4,Can't Stay Away from Sweet Valley,"Okay,I've been reading Sweet Valley for years, and this book really rocked my world. I liked it for the most part, but what in the world is going on with Jessica? Elizabeth has going through changes before, but she's always gone back to the same thing. Now Jessica might not be Queen of SVH? Something is seriously wrong with the world! Jessica is always Queen of SVH. I know she'll get the guy in the end, she always does. Will seemed so nice at first, I can't believe he did that. But, I was kind of disappointed that the book barely mentioned Enid, or Ken, Aaron, Winston, even Lila, and the twins are at her house. It was a good book though, a well spent 99 cents. Buy it. I can't want for #2, Say it to My Face."
4,A good beginning.,"I like this series a whole lot better than Sweet Valley High. Sweet Valley High was so unrealistic. Senior Year is great because it's more real. Sure some characters are dropped and new ones are added, but SVH did that all the time. They would focus on the twins for seventeen books and then decide to have a plot involving someone else. If you liked SVH, you will love Senior Year."
4,I'm glad it was only a dollar,"Well, Jessy and Lizzie are growing up. I think it's ridiculous how Jess fell like a rock for Will so very quickly without realizing he was hooked up. And Melissa, she's awesome if a bit neurotic. I love how the social ""food chain"" is changing, with Jess no longer on top. The femme fatale man-eater cheerleader thing is finally over. The characters weren't as well developed in this book as they are in the later SVH Seniors, but I suppose this is the getting to know eveyone period. Liz is so dumb for liking Connor and I think that if you are reading Seniors and SVU at the same time, Liz's obsession with sarcastic jerks is getting really old. Overall, a decent book, but the later books in this series get better."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I waited a long time for Sweet Valley High: Senior Year to come out and when it did, I bought it immediately. But I was really disappointed with it. Elizabeth has changed so much - she seems like a different character, and it doesn't seem right making Jessica unpopular. There are so many new characters, and they rarely ever mention Winston, Todd, or Enid. I liked Sweet Valley how it was before the earthquake."
2,What a change!,"I don't understand this series at all! What is up with all the new characters? I hate it when the author suddenly changes everything without even remembering the past. Where is Lila, Winston, Todd, Enid......? It's like they disappeared! Those characters made Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield who they are. The changes in the other series weren't so drastic (i.e.- Sweet Valley High to Sweet Valley Twins) as they showed the twins when they were younger. The main supporting characters such as Lila and Todd were there but now it's like they don't even exist in this ""Senior High"" series. The covers don't look all that great either. I know Cynthia and Britney are moving on and can't pose for those SVH covers forever, but at least the faces of Jessica and Elizabeth don't have to change! There are way too many changes and I think that this series doesn't even try to keep the warmth and familiarity of the series that existed before."
1,Dislike,"I love SVH and SVU books and have been reading them forever but now.... well I am sticking with only SVU. After only one book I have been turned away from SVH:Senior Year series. The characters Winston, Patty, Devon and Bruce where not mentioned once and enid and todd where in it a very small amount.Then you have all thses new people that have taken over SV by being more popular and disliking Jessica and Elizabeth now wants to be different. She wants No straight A's and wants to dress sexy.This is NOT the sweet valley I have come to love"
3,MMmmmmmm^.....Maybe you should stay away^....,"After reading this book, I was unable to decide whether I should stay away from this series. I have read this series since I was in the third grade, but know the series that I have grown to love has changed. No longer is Elizabeth worried about her grades, instead she is determined to show up cute but annoying Conner, a student from El Carro high. Jessica on the other hand has met her worst enemy, a girl named Melissa who is out for blood to prove that she is the best cheerleader. I expected to see more of Lila, Amy, Todd, Winston and Enid. This book almost seemed to forget about the horrible earthquake that had just occurred- If the Wakefields were not living at Lila's, you would never even know that it happened. Email me at SweetValleyFan@hotmail.com"
4,It was pretty good.,"The storyline was ok but I wish Jessica would stand up for herself. And I hate Will. And Melissa. But overall, Can't Stay Away is a pretty decent book. I recommend it to all Sweet Valley fans."
3,OK for review,"I bought this book with the intention to take the exams at college, but it seems that most colleges do not accept these advanced placement exams for graduation credit?"
4,SF Travelogue,"Nasir says ""...as a native Arab I had found most sf portrayals of theMiddle East to be the most astonishing malarkey. I wanted to write about the region as it really is: hot, jostling, ancient, and human-intense, and about the luminous inner awareness awakened by its blinding days and jasmine nights, its silent ruins baking the stillness of orange groves.""The story begins in a simple hut on the Jordan River. Blaine Ramsey is a""digger"" who prospects for compelling subconscious images for use inadvertising. He finds his dreams and even his days haunted by an Egyptian film goddess. He travels to Cairo to pursue his vision.The mystery of Ramsey's goddess/actress is revealed, if not explained,against the exotic, tumultuous Cairo urban landscape. For readers of American science fiction, Jamil Nasir's travelogue in this book should be as strange and exciting as any trip to an alien planet."
1,Didn't work at all,"I have FOUR computers (I'm a programmer), and I could not get these CD's to work on any of them. The browser software included just hung for several minutes until returning an error. I couldn't even just browse the files on the cds (I tried several cds). There's something wrong with the way they are recorded. I even tried on my dvd reader. Just pop any cd in the computer and the whole machine freezes. Again, it isn't just one computer, same story on Windows 2000 and XP. Completely unusable."
5,Overwhelmed!,I ordered this package since I just needed a few images for a project I was doing and it looked nice. When it came in the mail I could not believe how heavy it was and there was so much inside. It comes with a huge printed image manual which makes finding any image easy. It is over 1800 pages! This was so much more than I expected. I just ordered a second copy for my friend. 5 stars!!!
2,Was ready to Explode!,"Purchased Nova 800,000 Clip Art and was very disappointed in the quality of the clip art and extremely labor intensive navigation system. After working with the software for about an hour I was ready to Explode! If you have nothing but time on your hands then you may enjoy the program. Just not user friendly!Thank you Amazon.com for the excellent customer service and speedy refund!"
2,Don't be impressed with quantity.,"My IT person bought this and I can only think he must have been impressed by the huge AMOUNT of clip art. Most of it is useless, what we used to call ""nephew art,"" as in ""My nephew is only 12, but you should see him draw."" There are good pieces, many of which decorate the box, but I have found the collection overall fairly useless. It's clumsy to navigate, as are other clip art collections, but my main complaint is just the poor quality of the clips. As an example, out of over 90 leprechauns, there wasn't a single one of even a low level of professional quality. It's easier to draw something myself. Even the smallest of church and company newsletters would do better to explore other options"
4,Good Stuff - Good Service,"I've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and I finally broke down and bought it. Very pleased with everything included. LOTS of stuff to use, and not just cheezy clip art - lots of boarders, symbols, brush strokes, etc. The bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc (disc 3 was actually disc 30) - one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked."
5,Tried and True,"I used a similar Art Explosion product to this one at a place I worked in the past and I was impressed by the wide variety of images available and the ease of use. This new product doesn't seem to be as simple to use as the old one I used, burt once I got used to it, it is just fine. I love it.I did have problems loading a few of the disks, but after talking with tech support they sent me new disks without any hassle. The 3 or 4 days I had to wait for the disks to arrive was inconvenient, and I was rushed on the j0b I specifically bought the disks for, but overall I am pleased with my purchase and the tech service."
1,Not Crazy about Art Explosion,"I returned this product after reviewing the book to see how the program works. I have Print Artist and it's so much easier to use than Art Explosion. When I'm looking for a particular picture in Print Artist, I type a word and it gives me numerous pictures to choose from. From what I read about Art Explosion, you have to look up the picture in a book and then find the right CD."
2,Photos Dated,"There is a tremendous variety of clip-art and photos, but if you're focused on photos for use in a modern context, you'll be disappointed.The photos seem very dated - maybe 10-20 years old, so not very usable for modern web work, also their Hi-res is low res.Eoghan Odinsson, Award Winning Author of ""Northern Lore: A Field Guide To The Northern Mind, Body & Spirit"""
3,Great for a Beginner,"I bought this many years ago when I first started working in graphic/web design for a major online company. There are some useable graphics in it, but most are poor quality or mediocre at best. I certainly would not use most of the graphics in it. For a boxed set of clipart though, it's probably the best available and not bad for a beginner web designer. And, believe me, I've bought them all over the years, including Broderbund's many packages."
4,Where's the Mac version?,This is a great product. I know it's available in a Mac version and I wish Amazon would offer that. I guess I'll have to buy it somewhere else.
1,Poor Graphics with Missing material,I bought this product because of the reviews of other users. I needed medical clip art for a medical new letter and there is NO medical clip art on any of these CD's! The clip art that I have reviewed on other subjects is of the poorest quality I have ever seen. Don't waste your money on this product.
3,"Good, but needs a search function","If you do any PowerPoint, Smart Notebook, or other computer generated presentations, this is a great resource to add visual impact. It could use descriptive file names for rapid searching."
4,Great artwork and fonts,"Disc 3 was actually a duplicate of disc 30. I needed the vector artwork contained on disc 3 and contacted the manufacturer. They did ship me out a correct disc 3 very promptly. However, it arrived with a 70 cent postage due envelope.I am passing on this information because the manufacturer warned me that a large shipment of Art Explosion 800,000 was released with this error. Amazon needs to be aware of the problem. Regards, PJK"
3,Getting Better,"I must say, the clip art in this edition has gotten so much better than my previous buy. However, I am very disappointed with the quality of all of the photographs. They are blurry, have compression noise and are not very well composed. And do I really need 10 copies of each photo....um NO! My little point and shoot digital takes better pictures than these...think I'll take my own."
1,Extra money for the printed catalog,"They sell you a clipart-collection for over $ 80,-- and than they ask for another $ 5,-- for the printed catalog. That must be a joke guys!"
1,Buyer's Remorse!,"Talk about junk! No search capability, mislabeled cds, some cds won't run - in short, YUK!"
3,Good Value for the money,"This is a vast collection of clip art and fairly easy to find once you get use to using reference card. I was quite disappointed to find that the graphics did not always correspond to those shown in the manual. Some were missing or different. Disc 3 didn't have the correct images, I email customer support and they mail me a replacement disc very quickly. When using the catalog book to look up an image you will need the Cd directory card to locate the right CD. The Portfolio image catalog is necessary if you are using Windows VISTA because Explorer won't display some images."
2,Don't use it for school,"Just too many images here and impossible to search; I bought one for projects for my kids in my class and I found I spent most of my time teaching them how to search for images. Then, they got very good at finding the inappropriate clip art which is abundant in this collection. Half clad women, people smoking or pictures of hypodermic needles, gang graffiti. You name it, it's there. I would suggest this collection be used by adults only!"
1,quantity not quality,"800,000 images without keywords - the only useful parts of this collection are the classic and traditional .tif's that you can take into illustrator and turn into vector. The high res images aren't, the clipart is less than microsoft office online quality and I've gotten far more use out of a 50,000 image collection b/c they took the time to keyword and catagorize the collection.If you like to look thru a book and put in one of the 32 disks and then find the image - then this collection is for you. If you want to have any sort of search capabilites, look elsewhere."
1,Not worth the money.,The clip art is not the quality I expected. It is really a big stepdown when I compare it to the individual graphics for sale on the Internet. I'm sorry I made this purchase.
3,Art Explosion - somewhat of a dud,"Pros: This library is on DVD's instead of CD's, big plus.Cons: NO EPS format, instead we have to work with the inferior WMF file format.Also, image catalog IS NOT INCLUDED. You have to order it for an additional $4.95, total inconvenience.Some of the color graphics are poor quality."
1,buy something else,"This comes with a huge number of images, but quantity isn't everything. Most of the images are of poor quality and low resolution [low dpi]. They are pretty much useless."
2,Not Worth It,"I bought this in hope of turning some clip art into paintings for creating canvas, block and tile art without concern for copyright. It was not easy to find specific images such as rooster, grapes etc. Many items were labeled as picture 1, picture 2, so it would not bring up a rooster in the search even though there might have been one. For me I was more interested in clip art as vector, old time images and/or art. These discs contain mostly photographs and real life images. I had ClickArt 250,000 from 2001 and found that more useful to me than this. I can see if you are using it for advertising or if you are a graphic artist but for the everyday, unknown, artist I expected more."
1,You must pay me to listen to this.,"UMMMMMMMM This is one of the worst things I have ever heard. Period. This guy needs voice lessons and guitar lessons. The songs are boring, they have no structure, no relevance, no substance, and no feel. Sounds like someone is tone deaf but doesn't know it. And he wants over 20 bucks for this crap."
4,9 Punk songs listed here:,1. What Goes Wrong2. Remembrance3. Reflecting Seductions4. Seeing Blind5. Fueling6. Frozen in Fury (live)7. Hint Without a Clue (live)8. Picture Erase (live)
2,Mixed feelings,"I have purchased several of these over the years. It's good for people who have a quick plate to wash, but that's about all. It's not good for washing all your dishes. I'm right handed and within a month, I seem to break the little piece of plastic that holds on the sponge right off ... which means the sponge wont stay on. I've done this with the brushes and the sponge. My mother who is left handed, doesnt have the same problem. My first one lasted for more than a year, so I'm thinking they reduced the quality or ""improved"" the design."
2,Works great and then it breaks...,"Picked one of these up 2 years ago and was thrilled for the first year or so, although it was always hard to clean. The plastic under the sponge pics up bacteria growth, before the sponge wares ought, so I had to replace the sponge and or scrubby brush attachments more than I thought necessary. Then, one day the entire head broke off...cheap product in the long run."
1,First OXO Failure,Love their products but this simply doesn't work. The sponge fails off with the slightest bit of pressure. Did I get a lemon or what?
2,"Nice try, but...","On first blush, the OXO dish scrub looked to be much higher quality than other similar products I've used, so I bought one. Initially I was very happy with it. However, over 2-3 months of use the black rubber plug used to seal the detergent inside the handle shrank (!), resulting in non-stop detergent leakage.If you're looking for a detergent dispensing scrub, try another OXO product: theOXO Good Grips 1063901 Soap Squirting Palm Scrub. I've had it for 4 months now and it's working wonderfully."
1,LEAKY UNIT,UNIT LEAKS DISH SOAP. NOT HAPPY. I HAVE A SCOTCH BRITE HEAVY DUTY DISH WAND THAT OFFERS BETTER PERFORMANCE.
1,Fell apart,"The scrubbing part started falling apart the first time I used this. When I tried to use it a second time, my dished ended up covered in blue specks. This is not worth the money!"
1,THIS SUCKS.,"I'm so over Oxo right now. Their stuff is just so overpriced and of such poor quality! I bought an Oxo pizza cutter in 1993, and that thing is STILL cutting our pizzas and quesadillas, and it looks brand new. What happened, Oxo? You guys got big and started churning out total crap? Boooo!This scrubby brush is just ridiculous. First of all, the sponge falls off. And second, the ""no-leak"" thing is false. It leaks like crazy. Every day, I have dishsoap caked all over the handles of BOTH my scrubby things - one has a sponge and the other has a brush - and that tells me right there that it's just a duddy design. I purchased them separately, and they're totally different products, but with the same soap button design. THEY LEAK! They will leak soap all over your counter and sink. Just say no!!"
1,Leaks Soap,"This scrubber started leaking soap three days after I bought it. I'm going to return it -- the soap runs down the handle making it slippery, and it's really annoying to use."
1,It leaks soap,"I'm a huge fan of Oxo products, but this one stinks. It leaks soap from the plug. I got this to replace my last Oxo dish scrubber which leaked soap from the scrubby end. No more Oxo dish scrubbers for me."
1,WORST OXO PRODUCT - DON'T DO IT!!!,"OXO, you are so much better than this. I have a lot of your products, but this might be the last one I buy. This thing is terrible. If you plan to have it longer than a week or two, then I would pass on this. Seriously, even if you get a good price you will pay more in the long run. OXO should have pulled these from shelves. Shame on them."
5,Nice Heavy duty scruber,"I just got this nice heavy duty scruber, I am so happy with it, because the one I had before was falling apart after a week of use. It looks and feels to be well made, and is easy to hold."
3,"Great at what it does, but replacement pads are ridiculously overpriced & difficult to find","I picked this up close to a year ago, and absolutely loved it for the first few months. It didn't leak any soap, was great at scrubbing any surface I threw at it, and just did a fantastic job of what it is made for. My problem with it is that the replacement pads are nowhere to be found in any local store, and even finding them online has been hit or miss. Amazon now finally carries them, but it costs as much for a pair of scrub pads as the entire unit did. This is the first OXO product I've found that I'm not sold on, and that I would not recommend to a friend."
2,"A good product previously, but new version is flawed","We've had several versions of the Oxo Good Grips scrubber. The latest one, however, is a real lemon. After a few uses, the rubber ""button"" you depress to dispense soap into the sponge stops working. You press and press and press and can see the little plunger thingy moving inside, but no soap comes out. Basically useless."
1,frustrating,"If you plan on ever getting a refill for this, get ready for extreme frustration. It's already overpriced for a sponge. Then, when you wear out the two sponges it comes with, the new ones they sell don't fit and you're left with a plastic stick. Wake up! Sponges are cheap. This product is high style, low outcome."
2,Leakage at rubber button after a few months,"Yes, it's true, this will leak after a few months usage because there is no rubber seal on the handle. Rubber on plastic will eventually give way to a liquid leaking out. Oxo finally solved this issue by developing a handle that completely seals the rubber button but you refill the soap by turning the handle in a screw type fashion. The catch is that you have to buy it with a stand, which costs about $3 more. Oxo probably realized this while testing the base out with their older model dispensers that were leaking soap out at a much faster rate since the handle is laid upright and not lying flat. See my review on the Oxo soap dispenser with a base."
3,great if it didn't leak,"We have one of these scrubbers at home & have used it for years, so I think of this as a good product, although it's hard to get it squirt soap. Just bought a new one for our vacation home -- it's been used maybe a month, but the handle leaks no matter what we do to stop it. This one will go in the trash."
4,A good worthy one,I always trust electronics of Japanese brands for they're usually with fine qualities in all espects. I tried this reciever at my friend's. I really enjoyed the digital effect and the convenience of this product.
5,Great mix of old and new,A great mix of old and new rap/hip hop. The soundtrack really matches the movie (which was great)...
2,Ok,"This and another CD I purchased used to replace what I had lost. I bought it used. It came with missing album art but the CD was in new condition. It had no scratches and works as it should. I recommend buying used CDs from Amazon. If you're into music, it can get mighty expensive buying brand new. Buy used if possible."
3,Only a few good songs,"It was a good movie, but the songs weren't that great - hence the CD has problems. I really loved ""Friday"" by Ice Cube and ""Keep Their Heads Ringin'"" by Dr. dre, but other than that, the CD really bogged down. Get the singles if you can, but I don't recommend the whole thing!"
3,It'll keep your head ringin'.,"This is actually a pretty good soundtrack. Even if you haven't seen the movie, most people should like it. The first number of tracks are all rap. Great songs from ""Ice Cube"", ""Dr.Dre"", ""Scarface"", and ""Cypress Hill"". Then the middle of the disc has a few R&B/funk type tracks that are sweet. The ""Isley Brothers"", ""Rick James"", and ""Rose Royce"" are all pretty smooth. The end of this is kind of mixed, most of it good listening though. Anyone looking for one style here will be bummin', but those with an open mind and broad taste will look forward to this like it's ""Friday""."
4,liber iocularis,"This is a wonderful introduction to Latin for middle and high school students. It takes a more or less ""whole language"" approach to Latin, a novelty in itself. It is not very thorough in terms of grammar (cases and conjugations, for instance), but it's a great tool for getting kids interested in Latin. This mostly occurs because the stories are FUNNY -- and that's a great way to start with the language."
1,This was not the best book I have ever read.,"i did not like this book because i thought that the choice Shannon made was dumb. I'm not going to say the ending of the book, but I sure hope nobody else out there makes this choice. Other readers might like this book, but it wasn't for me. My tip:If you want to try this book, check it out at the library first, just so you don't waste your money on something you don't like. If you really like it, then my it."
5,Best Lotion,"I first purchased this for myself and have it next to the sink in the kitchen. It is the perfect place because your hands always seem so dry after you do any cooking or dishes. You just need a small amount, and it smells great. My friends have used it at my home, and always talk about how nice it feels and the clean, cool scent. I also purchased it as gifts and the recipients love it."
3,Clarification!,"Earthsuit (the band) made (the album) ""Kaleidoscope Superior.""7star (the band) made (the album) ""Earthsuit.""I hope this clears things up."
3,Have we checked?,"Instead of griping about the band, (is it THE earthsuit out of New Orleans?) how bout we check the band members names inside the cover? maybe that would clear the fog...KS is the latest cd out by Christian band earthsuit... to my knowledge."
2,This is NOT Earthsuit,"Perhaps I'm the only idiot who bought this CD because I thought it was another by the BAND Earthsuit, but just in case--this is NOT an album by Earthsuit. It was listed as a CD others who bought Earthsuit CDs bought, but the styles are VERY different (which makes me think others got confused too). I wouldn't compare 7star to Earthsuit--Earthsuit is more hip-hop fusion with raegae fused with house music. 7star has some techno influences but is largely vocal driven.I'm sure this album is good in its own right, but it isn't Earthsuit (the band), which is what I was looking forward to :-("
4,All about home,I purchased this book for my husband. He said he enjoyed the book. It is a collection of short stories about Skip Johnson's experiences in West Virigina.
2,"Great movie, but horrible copy!",I purchased this and watched what looked like 240p on YouTube. Very disappointed and felt like a complete waste of time and money. Horribly pixelated and blurry. Live and learn.
5,much too much too much,"This music is so astonishingly beautiful it should be reserved for rare moments. Sometimes, I find it too emotional and as other reviewers have suggested, it combines genius musicianship with sublime improvisation. Indian music like this seems to put great emphasis on the pure beauty of single notes, bent and polished into moments of magic. My record of 2005 by miles, a treasure generously given to the world."
2,Not a helpful book,"This book should not be used to teach beginning students Spanish. I think it is confusing, and many grammar and verb tense rules are not clearly stated in the book. Honestly, I didn't use the book much....I relied more on the teacher's notes. Plus, the stupid videos and comic-type strips become annoying and monotonous."
2,Dime Uno is hard to understand,"As a student in high school trying to use Dime Uno, I find that I cannot find any information about grammar, punctuation, or vocabulary without reading the entire chapter through. The cartoons would be better if the were not quite so frequent, as they are, they hinder learning. They only teach in the singular for the first unit,making it hard to learn the plural when it is taught. I would look for another textbook."
1,Cheap and flimsey... Going back,"This lamp is cheap and flimsey. The top part has stripped threads and it seems like the bolt doesn't even fit the size of the opening for the top part. The shades are cheap plastic and it seems like it will fall over at any time. It's worth the extra money to have a quality lamp, or at least one that isn't embarrasing to have in your home."
4,A nice collection edited for easy use.,"Jim Beloff has created a small industry collecting old ukulele tunes, editing them, adding chord symbols and publishing them in books like this. This particular collection is one of my favorites, along with Beloff's ""Ukulele Favorites"". Both books offer around 30 tunes and a very complete set of chord charts for the price of a couple of sets of strings. Not bad."
4,Wiedersehen with Luise Rainer,"This dark story of obsession, greed, addiction and devotion centres around Dostoyevsky's life at the time when he wrote his novel ""The Gambler"". Here we have a fascinating insight into the sombre world of Saint Petersburg as compared to the glittering sophistication of the German gambling resort of Baden-Baden in the 19th Century. Michael Gambon heads an illustrious cast and his performance of the tormented, epileptic writer, fighting against a deadline to complete his novel in order not to lose the copyrights to all of his oeuvres, is absolutely convincing. Jodhi May is credible and heart-rending as the young Anna Grigorevna Snitkina; she portrays amazing strength. An added bonus is a rare appearance by Luise Rainer as the Grandmother. Then 87 years of age (i.e. in 1997), she remained as elfishly enchanting as when she won the Academy Award back in 1936 and 1937 successively - a sheer delight. It took me several days to get this story out of my mind."
4,This is a history book more than a recipe book.,"Jeff Smith gives some incredible instruction on food history and what feasting means to humanity before he ever gets to the recipes in this book. I love how he moves from past to present. Food is so very social and this man communicates well how important a sense of community and dining are linked. Makes me yearn for more extended family meals that have significance. The way I think about entertaining is altered after reading this book. Give yourself some time, sit down with a cup of tea, and give this book a good read. It is much more than a collection of recipes."
1,Weak!,This bag did not last 1 camping trip. We placed the approved cook stove in this bag and one of the handles ripped away from the bag upon picking it up. Then the seam started to pull apart on the bottom. I'm not sure if this bag was a dud or just the product itself.
3,This bag is not so tough....,This bag works well for carrying and storing the stove but it is not too tough. Just transporting it two times to campsites left many holes in it. It's just not tough enough to handle the sharp edges found on all sides of the stove. I had to duct-tape much of the inside of the bag to handle the wear.
2,Bag Is NOT a custom fit for Denali 3 Burner Stove,I purchased the Camp Chef Denali 3 burner stove and wanted a custom bag to protect and carry it. The CB90 carry bag picture is misleading. It gives the impression that it is a custom fit for the stove. It isn't. It's just a large duffel bag. Be careful when you order it.
5,works,Bought this to carry and store our 3 burner stove. Went on its maiden voyage this past weekend and it seems very well constructed and fits very nicely.
2,Not too impressed,"There were a few songs that were good like Under the Sea(A Teens) You'll be in my Heart(Usher),Colors of the Wind (Ashanti) and I Wanna be Like you (Smash Mouth)- and some others that were ok but Some Day My Prince will come(Anastacia)i could not even recognize.What I thought would be my favorite song on the Cd- I just can't wait to be King, was dissapointing to say the very least. There was no omph- It was much better in the LION KING."
1,No use for this book,"Of the many usability and design-oriented books I've had to slog through in search of useful and practical information, this isn't one of them.I found it to be a waste of my reading time and was, in some parts, actually annoying (if a book can be annoying) because I was earnestly searching for practical advice... and all I got was, as another review suggested, hipster commentary.If that's your thing, go for it."
2,"All potatoes, no meat","There are some authors who I may not always agree with but I'll pull their books off the shelf time again for reminders about what works on the web. Jakob Nielsen and David Siegel come to mind. On the basis of this book, Jeffrey Veen won't be joining the pack. When he tries to be strategic, the book rambles. When he gets down to detail, e.g. style sheets, do'ers will be disappointed. Any book that says ""This code will produce this result"" must expect users to write up the code and try it for themselves. In that case they'll be disappointed with Veen's book. Keep browsing and you'll find better value for money."
1,He Blinded Me With (Dismal) Science,"This book may have been average fare in 1995 but hello, it's 2001.In the 7-8 years that the World Wide Web has been an information destination, the world has seen just over a jillion books about web design. The vast majority of them are better written, better researched and free of sloppy grammatical and spelling errors, unlike this me-too release. At best, it's an introductory book for the Rip Van Winkle who has just discovered the Internet.If you want science, do yourself a favor and stick with titles from Jakob Nielsen.(Is it just me or is this book's cover remarkably similar to ""Permission Marketing"" by Seth Godin?)"
2,Try a different title,"Two stars for what its worth. I'm dissatisfied with the way this book is written. Its not straight to the point and lacks substance. Although some chapters proved to be informative like (i.e. chapter one: foundations) they could still be found from other resources like the internet (and its free!!). (translation: i regret having spent my money on this book). The book was a dissapointment i thought id be reading the thoughts of a real seasoned expert, i was wrong. Now Veen will be in my ""ignore the books of this writer"" list."
1,"pretty worthless, really","I'm not sure who this book is intended for. For readers new to web design, it doesn't seem to be the most useful resource. And for web designers with any experience the author seems to go into excruciating detail explaining the obvious."
2,"Another ""expert"" writing about common sense","Let's face it, if you have any sense for web design you don't need this book (especially for. The same blah, blah, blah about consistency and page download speed. It's common-sense, people!"
3,Interesting but faulted,"The book is helpful and interesting for a print designer just getting into web design. It has lots of insight into why and how sites work, and good solutions to surviving the vagaries of web design for those of us used to designing type within a tenth of a point.However, I have to wonder about quality control. I'm shocked at the number of typos in this book. There is no reason for any publisher to print a book with 10 typos bookwide, much less 10 typos (at a minimum) per chapter. I doubt if this reflects the author's expertise, but I wonder if it doesn't reflect a particular laziness in attention to detail, both on Veen's part and on the part of the publisher. If this were a textbook, or if it presented hard facts or figures rather than opinion, I'd demand a refund.Let's hope the book sells well so it can go back to press and all those mistakes can be fixed.Overall, good ideas that unfortunately need to be taken with a grain of salt."
2,"Not particularly useful, out of date, sloppily written and edited","By his own accounting, Jeffrey Veen is an ""internationally sought-after speaker, author and design strategist"" but more so, he's good at cobbling together a bunch of rather trite and obvious observations about web design, and packaging them up in an expensive book with his face on the cover.The writing is sometimes unforgiveably awful: ""Good designers are harnessing the technology available to them and using it to encode the process they use to do good design."" I just wish Veen had harnessed some of that technology to do good writing.Add to that bad copyediting: Veen recalls glory days at his ""alma matter"". And he tells us that the book is not a reference manual or even a style guide. ""Rather it (sic) a mentor..."" Maybe so, but it a sloppily written and edited mentor.Now, it's hopelessly out of date as well. Get Steve Krug's book instead."
5,Good dog food!,"This is good ORGANIC food for your dog! Found on Dr. Michael Fox's website.I have such faith in Dr. Fox! He is knows all about most animals,especially dogs and cats.My dog really likes this! I giove it ti her with some dry food."
2,Why did I think this was a good idea?,"There is zero need for a sprayable form of Hoppe's #9, it is smelly and gets everywhere you don't want it. There is no applicator straw, you just get Hoppe's...everywhere. Buy a jar and you'll be happier."
3,bad return policy,products are good but their return policy is bad. if a product is used at all you can't return it. how would you know it was bad unless you actually tried it?
4,Great Information,I really enjoyed this book. It has given me a great deal of information on the toxicity we have in our lives. I plan to purchase a high quality juicer and start juice fasting every few months. There is also some great and easy lifestyle changes that can be made to make a big impact.
3,"Good Theme, But Overdone","I purchased and read this book at the recommendation of a good friend. While I agree with Colbert's basic assertion that we need to eat healthier and avoid added chemicals, he goes off the deep end with a myriad of recommendations for organic food, juices, and other products to add to our diets. This title would have been MUCH better had he kept things simpler, not overwhelming the reader with so many radical changes.Colbert's work here is definitely Christian in content and tone, but I deeply appreciate that perspective. In fact, the best part of the book is the final section ""Detoxing Your Whole Person,"" which gives detailed instructions on the many benefits of spiritual fasting. I plan to keep the book in my library simply because of this important section.This title isn't for everyone. If you're looking for some new, unashamedly Christian insights on improving your diet and taking care of your body however, you'll find something of use here."
5,"Fasting For the Body , Mind & Soul","I love this informative Detox book. Just by reading the title you would think it only tells you how to detox your body though fasting, (juice fasting)but it also tells you why detoxing is good for your mind, body and soul. It is done from a Christian point of view. Don Colbert has also enclosed a Fast journal in the book. And the book also tell you what fruit, and vegetables are highly beneficial to you, which ones to avoid and which ones are neutral according to your blood type. I give this book five star because it has encouraged me to fast (something that I never like to do.)as a way to be closer to God."
3,Good information but...,"The book has been well reviewed by the previous writers. My main complaint was the constant repetition of information. When I got to the fast and read that I should already have been following the liver support diet for two weeks, I began searching the first 75 pages to see where the diet was mentioned...no luck! He gets to it near the end of the book. This was pretty frustrating. Dr. Colbert has a convincing and easy-to-read style of writing though the program appears quite expensive to carry out. Good information."
2,Toxic Relief,"This book could have been written in 1/4 the number of pages. The author repeats his information countless times. He has some good things to say, but saying them so many times is senseless. The layout is also counterproductive. Many times throughout the book the author refers to the Liver Detox Diet, but doesn't give that diet until toward the end of the book.Summary of the book: Take a week or so and eat/drink nothing but juiced or pureed fruits and vegetables (organic preferred)."
3,Toxic Relief Review,The book is informative and has many valid usable points for the diehard health nut to the person that occasionally thinks about cleansing their body. You can pick and choose what you want to get out of the information.
2,Interesting but is it worth the money?,"Interesting, but is it worth the money? More current books with more current research and more details are my style."
2,not enough information for me.,Didn't have enough information for me. I didn't feel comfortable after reading this book alone to complete a fast.
4,This book is for people who are willing to fast.,"I have seen Dr. Colbert on John Hagee's Ministries. In fact after seeing him on the program, I purchased the book. I did enjoy reading it. Dr. Colbert is easy to understand and it pertains a lot of good information. However, I am not willing to fast. If you are willing to do this then this book is for you. I would recommend it to someone who was considering fasting."
2,Very disappointing product,"This firewall caused a lot of troubles to my internet connection. For example, it blocked the renewal of the IP lease from the DHCP server providing regular connection interruiptions. Also its GUI was permanently failing and required complete reinstallation.I cannot recommend to anybody the purchase of this product."
1,Cannot log on to DSL server,After installing this I had problems logging on to my DSL provider. It was buggy from the start - I uninstalled this and very disappointed that I wasted my money on this. I couldnt return it so I am stuck with it! :(
1,If negative stars were possible..........,"Absolutely the worst piece of software I have ever owned... Caused constant system instability, and even the uninstall caused problems... and forget about support from mcafee, you're not going to get it.... save your money and allow all the hackers in the world in, because they are not going to be as damaging as this piece of software."
2,Good if not using ICS,"I'm sure this would be a good product if it was compatible with Internet Connection Sharing(ICS). Unfortunately, this product doesn't work on the gateway computer with ICS enabled. Only purchase if you don't have a home network."
4,Other Brazilian's Music,"The great brazilian band, Engenheiros do hawaii with this 1992' album , show us elements of brazilian popular music with influences of progressive rock. Result is a beatiful record that would be listened all over the world."
3,So - So,"I would wonder why the previous reviewer would have been so thrilled to finally get this book. It was in my very small library and since 1975, it has been checked out some 25 times. It was ok but really was a very early romance/gothic type story. I'm glad there are some authors who write with more depth in this day and time."
5,Best Cookie Recipes Ever!,"When my Mother passed away, this Cookie Collection Book was in her cookbook collection. It was the most worn of her cookbooks, and as I turned the pages, it brought back many wonderful memories for me of Christmas. She used to bake cookies for friends and family, and a tin of her cookies was a much coveted gift. I now continue that tradition, and use several recipes from this cookbook. Although her handwritten comment in the margin said merely ""good"", one of everyone's favorites were the Date Nut Pinwheels on page 11. In short, a terrific book with recipes that have stood the test of time."
5,Perfect Condition,"I wasnt able to find any versions of this book except on Amazon. Book arrived in perfect condition, and is just as I remembered it when I bought my first one years ago. Great value!"
5,Great book!,The book arrived promptly and in good condition. My young grandson loves this book and it's read often. It's a welcome addition to my Mousebook Collection. Thanks!
2,"Book, but no tape; very disappointing","My 3 year olds are really enjoying the books on tape that I grew up using. I thought it would be fun to add some Disney books on tape to our collection. I read the title and description very carefully and understood that I was buying a used item. When the item arrived, I only received the book and not the tape. Obviously this was completely useless for my purposes and I was very disappointed since the description and title stated that the tape is included. On the bright side, Amazon paid for the return and processed my refund very quickly."
1,Pathetic excuse for a database,"Suffice it to say, if you are really into using databases effectively, puchase ThinkDB or HanDbase and a memory upgrade. You will be miles ahead of this overpriced, exceptionally poorly designed database. The biggest detriment is that tables can ONLY be designed on the desktop and then downloaded (hotsync'd) to the PDA. You can NOT design on the fly."
4,AWESOME!,This was an awesome video! It was really funny and showed the guys personalities really well. The only thing was that I wanted to see more of them making the videos. But other than that it was REALLY GREAT! Any BSB fan would love it!
1,I was very dissapointed with this video.,"I used to like BSB. They had pretty good songs, and they looked cute. Then, I saw this video. I had extremely high expectations. They acted soooooooooo phony, I realized that they are just a couple of kids that want to be big stars (which in my book, they aren't). Their dance moves are not even close to flowing with the song. I wouldn't be surprised if they don't even sing their own songs. Rent it, don't buy it, and you'll see. Let's see if you are still a Backstreet fan. I'll just say that I doubt it."
5,FUN!,"These guys are so much fun to watch you feel like you'll never stop smiling while viewing this video! A.J. takes you on a personal tour of the set of a video shoot, we see costume and make up changes, the director and choreographer's opinions of the boys, and of course, we get a front row seat to the music as they rehearse, dance, and sing their hearts out for us!Includes fan's faves like As Long As You Love Me, Backstreet's Back, Quit Playing Games and even a sneak preview of All I Have to Give.BUY THIS VIDEO! You'll REALLY ENJOY THIS ONE!"
5,great video of these awesome guys!,"wow! i mean, this is SUCH a cool video! it has some REALLY funny behind-the-scenes during the making of the videos ""Everybody"" and ""As Long As You Love Me"". there's footage from some concerts where they sing a bunch of their really awesome songs! they are so cute and cool in this video! trust me and BUY IT!"
4,It's was absoulutly fantastic!,"The backstreet boys all access video was the best! I liked all the songs and not a one I didn't like! It was spetacular, I love the Backstreet Boys and that video was the best and i can't wait to see the rest!!!!!"
5,All Acsess Video,This video is REALLY good!!! If you like the Backstreet Boys get get it!!!! It is worth paying for. They show you a lot of things like the making of some of their videos and they have interviews. I love the Backstreet Boys!!! Especilly Brian!
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED FAN!,"I am a HUGE Backstreet Boys fan and I'm sorry to say but this video really disappointed me. They showed so much material that had already been aired on television besides one part ""On The Set Of As Long As You Love Me"". This part was very good and entertaining but the rest was thumbs down. I was disappointed with BSB and the fact that I had wasted money on this pathetic video. To add to this, A Night Out With The Backstreet Boys was not too impressive either. The filming was awful and it wasn't what I expected. Although they did sing new songs, that was the good part, *** stars for that video. Sorry BSB."
3,BSB RULZ!,"Okay, this video is cool, if you like AJ (like me) you'll love this one because he is the 'tour guide' throughout the video. It's funny and filled with great shots of preparation for some of theirs video's. I wasn't so sure about the live performances, they were okay. HOMECOMING is a better one on that. But a side of that it's a great video! Love ya!"
3,Backstreet Boys Good--This video no so good.,"If you're looking for content that shows you how videos are made, this one starts out great, but then ends in disappointment."
2,Not for my Conure...,"This is a cute, seemingly well made toy. The only problem with it, is that I seem to like it more than my green- Cheeked Conure Joey.This probably has more to do with my birds personality than the toy itself. The toy appears appropriate for my Conure but I would not give it to a larger bird. It is a cute plastic foot toy."
4,"For sugar-free, not bad at all","If you have a sweet tooth like I do and have to watch your sugar, this is a good choice for a taste of chocolate cookies. They're individually wrapped, keeping them fresh, and they are chocolatey. There are lots of walnuts in them and each cookie is big enough to dunk either in a cup of coffee or a glass of milk. I gave them 4 stars only because they're a little dry, but dunking will take care of that!"
3,frog wheel cover,I like the idea of this product better than the product itself. it has some sharp edges around the outer edges and it has a very odd smell to it. I've never had a wheel cover before and i'm not really thrilled with this one.
4,cool,"This steering wheel cover is very cute. It matches the rest of my motif in the car with the frogs! The texture is a little weird though, almost like a chalkboard feeling. But other then that, it keeps the wheel protected and does its job well."
1,Contains Lead,I gave this as a gift & my friend read the warning label which explained that the product contained lead & they recommend washing your hands after touching it. Because of the dangers of lead she ended up just throwing it away. I was disgusted that the product description says nothing about the lead or else I would never have purchased it!
3,Tree Frogs are kool,I love the designs on it and it feels really soft but im not sure how long the frogs will stay on the steering wheel cover
3,steering wheel cover,"Looks good but makes the steering wheel thick. I also saw it a K-mart for cheaper, but I'd already ordered it!"
1,discontinued in 2009,"Although this nailer is still in the distribution chain, Milwaukee discontinued the 7100-20 in 2009. Milwaukee claims it will stock parts for 7 years, but there is no guarantee they will have the part you need. If they don't have the part you need, you are on your own."
3,good overall,"i don't have a lot of framing nailer experience. i've used an old porter-cable and this one, so take this review for what it's worth.pros: light weight.work fine with grip-rite 16d 21 degree nails.easy loading.easy adjustments.cons: doesn't come with npt adaptor.used some grip-rite 21 degree framing nails (16d common) and had several jams using this gun.not enough power. usually milwaukee is about power first and light weight second, it seems that they went the opposite direction with this tool. i use a 2.6 gallon makita compressor at 120 psi and the gun seems to have trouble driving the .131 nails when toenailing.also jams a lot when using sheathing nails by grip-rite. the sliding nail holder holds the nails in place, but either doesn't push them into the queue hard enough or pushes them into a bad angle which caused me many problems when doing some sheathing recently. ugh."
1,A Piece of Junk,"I am a building contractor and seem to buy a new nail gun about every other year, having used mostly Senco nailers in the past. Most of my electric tools, such as drills, sawzalls, etc. are Milwaukee so I decided to give the Milwaukee nail gun a try. It arrived about a month ago. I was surprised by how much of it was plastic, but put it to work. For the most part it worked fine. This weekan employee was using it and somehow a driven nail ended up twisting around and catching under the driving pin. With other nailers, I had been able to drive the pin back to free the nail. I was not able to remove this nail, even after disasembling the nailer. All I can do is invest in a new nailer and it won't be a Milwaukee. If I could have given zero stars, that would have been my rating."
5,It's Been a Good Gun.,"Bought this on 4/28/08. Built a large shed with it that spring/summer. The nailer never failed. It is now at a friend's house for a remodel. Have also lent it to a carpenter/friend (Stuart Construction ` Herrin, IL). Keeps on tickin. Paid $176.78 for it"
5,Great Price for a Great Gun,"Purchased this nail gun in January for an old cabin remodel job. I've put a good number of nails through it....had no trouble finding nails for it as one review suggested. I've dropped it numerous times from heights of over 15 feet and didn't kill it, jam it, bend it etc. Being a female user, its lighter weight is a big bonus as is the two different firing methods. To hold it better I typically wrap my finger around the handle/trigger. So in the dual trigger, head against the object mode before it will fire is a safety feature to reduces the likelihood I shoot myself with the thing. Overall very happy with this nailer. I'd have to agree with others that it would be nice to have a carrying case if nothing else to put it in to protect it for transport."
5,Great product,Product arrived on time and just as described. Offers a quick and easy strength workout. I would highly recommend.
3,Good sturdy bar!,"I purchased the bar to compliment my P90X rotation. The bar is pretty sturdy once put together and so far I have not had any problems. My only complaint are the instructions or lack thereof. The instructions are diagrams with no text so it is very confusing, especially since the shorter screws seem too short to do the job. I had to go to a website where someone posted instructions on how to assemble it. Other than the instructions, I have no complaints about the bar at this time."
5,Good piece of equipment,"I think this is just what was looking for. A pull up bar that I didn't need to screw into the door frame, that I could take down easily, and that was sturdy enough to trust for a good workout. I really like it."
5,Danu sparkles with energy,"I have followed the career of this band closely for several years now and they never cease to amaze me. The vocals are haunting, the instrumentals moving and the flute playing is simply inspired! Tom Dooley will be one of the greatest in my lifetime. Having seen them live I know what a tremendous performance they give and look forward to enjoying that energetic style through this album. They make traditional music accessible to the masses. A must have for any fan of Irish music."
2,Sticker on top of pie server,There is a label sticker on the FRONT of the pie server that I can't remove or soak off! Works well but not attractive with the label that can't be removed! Why would anyone put a sticker on the serving part of server that will not come off?
3,It's Okay,"This works good as far as the flexible part,it slides smoothly underneath the slice to pull out easily.The downside I would say is it's not that great at cutting slices,but then again I guess it makes sense to use a knife,but isn't a pie server made to slice as well? I don't know all I know is that it's just good for serving not slicing.Also be cautious when storing this in a crowded drawer as it will bend and maintain that bend if not careful and you don't want that trust me.Honestly,You'll probably do better to get a stainless steel pie server unless your really worried about damaging your dishes."
4,sewing machine trolly,"I haven't used the trolley yet, but it looks to be sizable and sturdy. I had a different brand of trolley, and the handle broke. I have high hopes that this one will do better."
1,Disappointed in Dubuque,"I just purchased Virus Scan Professional 6.0 for my home computer. After installing a new hard drive, I needed to get some virus protection. Things initially SEEMED to be going well, but after running the installation and the first virus scan, my computer will not reboot. I just get frozen on the Windows screen. So far, the McAfee support has seemed pretty worthless as well. Needless to say, I am not a happy camper. I may check back in when things look up...but beware! (FYI, I tried to install on a PII 266 running 98SE)."
1,Does not live as a good citizen on your hard disk,"When I had to install MS VPN for Verizon DSL, McAfee began deleting Windows DLLs on my Win 98 machine. I had to reinstall Win 98 and the PC has never been the same again. McAfee clashes with a lot of existing software components that the user may have. Be careful... You have been warned!!!"
1,Avoid Avoid Avoid,I purchased this since my employer used an earlier version. It does install somewhat easily however I did get errors installing the firewall portion and had to reinsert the disk several times in an effort to repair it.The firewall set in the filter mode allows me to connect to the Internet but will not allow me to connect to any sites. I followed the online help but this did not correct the problem.I could not get through the online chat help. I filled out all the windows but I kept getting the all fields required default. I refused to pay for help with their product.I will be returning this for the Norton product I have on my home PC which has never been a problem and zone alarm works as firewall perfectly fine on my home PC also.Avoid Avoid Avoid
4,Strange Little Indie Effort,"This strange, independent film is inhabited by a bunch of no-name actors except for Frank Gorshin, who himself hadn't done much since TV shows in the 1960s. However, the acting was fine,The black-and-white cinematography also is good, actually VERY good. The photography, and the 1920s expressions (the era here with this story) on Gibson Frazier's face, are the best things about this film. The editorial review here called it ""snappy patter."" I like that.That ""patters"" get a little profane in the last 20 minutes but the sweetness of the film is saved in the end by a ""cute"" musical tune. Actually, the music is good in here all the way through. Overall, this is an odd film.....but definitely work a look if you are seeking something a bit different."
5,Joyful little film,"I caught this enjoyable flick on cable and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm putting it on my wish list for my upcoming birthday. I enjoyed the premise, and learned to just appreciate Johnny's situation, speech and attitude without needing to know the reason behind his being ""stuck in the past"". Sometimes, acceptance leads to understanding. Don't take yourself too seriously, and just sit back and let this film work it's way into making you smile."
3,"Yes!!. . .Well, o.k. . .I mean, almost. . .not quite. . .no, not all is hunkydory","For a short while I was taken: a good man hopelessly displaced in the wrong time. And then I was reflective: how unpleasant, how bad, how wrong this modern time is. Then I was just bored, until a wonderful--almost fully redeeming-- musical ending. Just relax, I said to myself at the end, it is just meant to be silly."
3,If you're in a forgiving mood...,"For starters, all the reviews that complain about the language in this film should pay closer attention to a film's rating. There's a reason that it's there. I think the coarse language was not very heavy, but because it juxtaposed with the overall theme of the film it stood out in sharp contrast and probably seemed more excessive that it was.That being said, Man of the Century is a huge piece of fluff built around a very, very good premise. Unfortunately, the one-joke plot loses a ton of steam as the film moves along. Fortunately, at 77 minutes, it doesn't drag it out beyond the point of no return. There is quite a bit of humor and the performances are all good. I particularly like how Johnny Twenties's mother appears to be stuck herself in the 1890's.If it's a slow television night and you don't set your expectations too high, Man of the Century is a quick mindless diversion."
4,The best movie I have seen in ages!,"I loved this movie so much that I immediately called my friends over to watch with me, but not Grandma and the kids.This film could have been great for kids except for one thing: foul language. It only has 2 little episodes of potty mouth, but that enough to ruin it for some sensitive people.So unnecessary.Otherwise, I adored this movie."
2,A sick joke..,"This film has disappointment written all over it. Despite the pretentious beginning, the well-meaning film becomes pointlessly obscure (like the dialogue) and the plot is non-existant. The mood is captured early on, but the outcome is as bare as a one-legged dancer. With good reason in deed, the film carries an R rating because of constant profanity."
1,"Great Premise, Very Disappointing","I was very excited about the premise of this movie. But within 20 minutes I was totally disgusted. The idea of a 20's man living in modern day New York could have made a great movie in the right hands. Obviously it was not. Sex, homosexual and otherwise, and profanity were the central themes. I'm sorry to say I purchased this DVD, If anyone wants it, I'll sell it real cheap. But you would still be ripped off. I would challenge a quality writer and film maker to take this idea and do something worthwhile with it."
4,Gary Barlow Lives On!,"This second Gary Barlow album has been anticipated for quite some time. I guess it took him Twelve Months and Eleven Days to finish writing and producing this new album.He carries on with his melodious, pop ballads, and hippy tunes in such tracks as ""Arms Around Me"" and ""For All that You Want"". This album is just as good as the first album he did. It may take a while for you to really appreciate each song, but it's worth the trip. Congrats Gary on your latest effort, More Power!"
1,Im so sorry but it aint Open Road,"This highly anticipated follow up was perhaps the most hyped album of the 21st century after the blockbusting success of the highly acclaimed 1997 magnum opus 'Open Road'. Tantalising glimpses of promotional materials, saw Gary teasing us with his absolute genius. When I heard this I cried so hard my face was wet. It was no open road."
4,gary's power continues.....,"while still enjoying listening to his first album, he released his scond album, after twelve months and eleven days!!!compared to his debut album, this has less powerful materials to present them to te world, well, at least ""for all that u want and ""stronger"" has continue his journey, after ""love wont' wait"", i bet u'll like this 2 numbers.his second album hasn't help him much to climb higher in the entertainment industry, unlike his first album, with variety of rhythm and choices, this album did not show what direction is he going to achieve in him future albums, but this is worth a listen, if u'r gary's fans and just misses his voice so much, then, get this, u won't be dissapointed by enjoying his vocal performance!"
3,Disappoitment,"I like Gary barlow because of his lyrics and his voice but this latest album of his is a bit bland. I only like less than half of his tracks. But I must admit that STRONGER is a strong single indeed. The video clip is cool as well. Better buy his singles intead of the whole album. Sorry Gary but I write all this based on my honest musical view. Fast car could have been a good song but the chorus is totally anti-climax... so damn boring! But i personally love your lyrics. Yesterday gerr is very boyzonish... 2 thumbs down. To be your life and hero is catchy and one of the stronger tracks. If he was one of the spice gerrs, he would be geri harliwell and Robbie williams ,Melanie C. Robbie is doing very well because of his choice of music. Come on Gary, I know that you can be more creative than this. You;re very talented. Do justice to your talent! Be stronger next time!"
4,rip fence review,"I was very pleased with the fence. It is well made,and had pretty good instructions for installation. I heartily recommend it."
1,Not Happy,I recieved the product half full and with dried polish all over the top. Looks to be used and or a refill of some sort. So who knows what kind of product you are actually getting!! Too bad cause I have a Custom Chopper that I really needed this polish for.BEWARE!!
5,A good job,"As one who has long reveled in papal history (I have read all 40 volumes of Ludwig von Pastor's magnificent and magisterial History of the Popes and all 19 volumes of Horace K. Mann's very readable and informative work on the medieval popes)I found that this book, despite its provocative title, does a good job telling the history of the Popes in 317 pages. When I first saw the book I expected to merely browse thru it but it caught me up and I read it all. I am giving it five stars not because I agree with all the author's judgments but because it is so well-written that there is not a dull page in the book. He tilts some to the ""liberal"" side, but that is to be expected, and I liked the fact, e.g., that he spent more time on Nicholas V than on Alexander VI. Incidentally, I did not have any trouble knowing which Leo or Gregory was being discussed, since they are all pretty individual persons one is not likely to confuse. An attention-holding and eminently readable work."
4,History of the Popes,Just beginning to read this book. Has some beautiful artwork! The history is important even though I am not Catholic as it is part of the history of the world.
4,very good,i am pleased with this purchase. i just wish that more books of this nature were available in larger print. overall i am very pleased
5,Beautiful,Incredible beauty...The voices of the opening song are really sweet. The music of Jody is always tasteful and full of love !
2,"Interesting, but political and not very useful","This book was a big disappointment. The topic of temporal databases is one that should be of great interest and widespread application. However, this book won't advance the science or the application in my opinion.The authors seem to continually have an ax to grind, to the extent that it detracts from the good ideas they do have. I don't recall having seen so many political opinions in a technical book in a long time: it appears that no other author or researcher has ever done anything right! It seems to me that they want to rename a bunch of database concepts just for the sake of having their own names on them.Most readers are probably better off to keep their money."
3,"Good, but not great","Turntable is very attractive. Sound on turntable and tape player are fairly good, but disappointing on radio. Sounds all right in a small room. Generally satisifed with the product, and the price was right."
2,Incomplete,"Unless I happened to get a bum copy, which is possible I guess, the first movie in this 3-movie set is missing a half hour! The Mechanic is only about 68 minutes long and the missing part is from about the time they begin to stalk the three motorcyclists. The phone rings and then there's a sudden jump to Italy near the end of the movie, just before a car chase. Renders the copy of the movie worthless. I don't know if it somehow has to do with them cramming THREE feature length movies onto one single disc or what... Just beware."
2,Single-disc version. THE MECHANIC runs short by a half-hour,"As the other reviewer noted, THE MECHANIC is incomplete by a half hour, with a drastic cut - the leads are in a darkroom and then suddenly in the middle of a car chase. I haven't watched the other films yet. I contacted TGG inquiring about a replacement but haven't received a response.UPDATE - received a nice reply from TGG saying there was a manufacturing error in the dvd and they would mail out a replacement."
5,Assassination/Messenger of Death/Mechanic,"I did received the three in one and have now watched all three movies. As I watched them it was nice to see some old friends, but as I was watching the mechanic there seemed to be a part missing. The movie worked fine though and it could just be my memory it has been a while since I have seen the movie."
1,Not what I expected,This is not worth $9.95 I could have picked up most of the information in the article from book reviews. I found out more about this author by doing a web search. I would not purchase from this source again.
1,your grandma in pasties,"total waste of time. the ""star"" never appears nude, but has various sistah relations with women who do. star also has a somewhat skanky boyfriend, with hipstah cool daddy-o relations with women who do. the women who do, do it sleepwalking, with tired music and tired costumes, hurrying through the sets not because they are nude but because they are embarrassed to be in this movie. bought it thinking, ""oh, hey, shots of paris in the '50's,"" but it's almost all stage sets and cheaply done."
3,Not that bad...,"'Programming Starter Kit for Macintosh' offers good advice, but hardly fills its claim as a starter kit. Not so much as it only includes a demo of codewarrior (What did you expect) but in that you really need to know C already to use this book. My recommendation: Buy CodeWarrior Discover Programming and a book about C, then move on to this."
1,Why buy blindly?,"I was not happy to see there is no table of contents. I guess the book contents are a secret? Why is there only one review, and after being published for over a year and a half? Not a very promising showing for a book with a one reader - five star rating. Based on lack of information and lack of reader interest I give the book one star. I have decided to go with the Sedona Method. Sorry Patty, better luck next time. Why not buy ratings like some of the best selling authors? Just offer lots of free stuff if people buy your book and give you a good rating. Lots' of folks do it. Do a search on wealth and prosperity and there isn't a single book that did gets it's ratings the good old fashion way, they bought them! Ask Joe Vitale. He even sells books on how to do just that.Too bad for the loser that did buy and rate your book. I bet they feel like a chump."
5,The Silence,I consider it is one of the most interesting pictures of IB and I would like to change opionions about.
5,love it,"I just bought this cd and iv herd it 3 times in a row!! Its an alsome cd! Best songs are:seven(my fav),Lady In The Jaguar ,red mist,Rollin Hard,the harvest and pray wit the snakes. I think this guy is going to do alsome on psychopathic records.MCL"
5,Very impressive!,"Don't get me wrong, I love psychopathic, and own about every cd they've put out, but the last few years they have seemed a little watered down and mediocre. Boondox is a breath of fresh air. This cd reminds me of why I got into Psychopathic's music in the first place. Diferent, original, and sick, with some cold beats. If you have been a little dissapointed in the more recent releases, don't be discouraged yet. Buy this cd, you won't regret it.MMFCL"
2,Misleading Book,"This book is very misleading. First of all, the title is Power Animal Meditations but inside the book, there are a lot of vegetable and mineral meditations such as trees and crystals. Second of all, the artwork on the cover are animals native to America but in the book, there are animals that are not native to America such as kangaroos and elephants. And third, the artwork on the cover is Native American but a lot of the artwork on the pages are Egyptian and Asian. If you are looking for a Native American book on power animal meditations, this isn't the book for you."
3,cute...but,It is a cute little kitchen item but it is also not so practical.We use it for honey but it gets a bit messy from the applicator.
5,Bought this just for Vinnie Moore's performance,"He played all of the rhythm guitar tracks. The bass and drums on all the tracks were cool too, but the standout performance is Vinnie on 2112/Temple. Great. Everything else was fairly standard tribute album fare. Buy if you are a fan of the artists playing on the album. Avoid if you are a geeky Rush fan who is going to be mad that this doesn't sound as cool as Rush and so you will come here and write a trashy review of it."
1,Bland and dated,"I feel sorry for anyone attempting to publish covers of Rush. One problem is vocals. Geddy's voice stands so apart from this batch of singers that it's disheartening to listen to. The vocalists surely sound much better on their own turf. Second, the arrangements don't match (or don't attempt to match) the unique energy of Rush. Unfortunately the songs sound very bland and dated as interpreted here."
1,Don't Buy,"Don't buy this album. I should have stopped after I bought the Working Man tribute album, but I didn't. This album is just a excuse for some shredders to flex their chops. They all sound alike (like one trick ponies). I thought they'd be the songs with their own spin on them, but all they did was play the tunes choppier and added new middle sections that don't fit the songs at all."
1,Absolutely Disgusting,"It appears my previous review was deleted (?) so I feel the need to ""assist"" all future Rush fan's who may be considering picking up this piece of garbage.This is yet another attempt by Magna Carta to cash in on the talent that its ""artists"" sorely lack. I would rather listen to Night Ranger in a Florida trailer park."
3,ok cd RUSH TRIBUTE,"i was hope for i better rush tribute this tribute has mainly artists from the 80,s randy jackson from zerba and kip winger i think that it,s nice that thesse guys did this but were are the current acts like p.o.d tool and flame lips event if or dinosuar jr were or event MADONNA I thought she was on here since i brought her new cd and i haven,t heard her in 9 years i thought she drop off the earth i thought was on this cd madonna doing rush covers and back to the cd randy,s version OF subdivisions it, had a diffrent open than than frist song but he sounds like robot on every track all 3 of them.thesse guys didn,t copy them this is a good thing and nice for to do."
4,Great Tribute Album,"The musicianship was great and the vocals were good. I am a Rush fan and thought these guys a great job. Some other people said Randy Jackson sounded like a robot on the album, but I though he did a good job (I've been a Zebra fan for years). I like when musicians do a tribute to other bands, they put their own sound into the music and usually the musicians are top notch"
2,"It is OK, but....","... I found that this was not something that I as a Rush fan enjoyed as much as I expected I would. This seemed to be more hard rock than Rush is. It seemed like there was too much of the individuals playing and not enough of those they are paying tribute to. Short of the words, this _IS NOT_ Rush. I honestly felt like I was listining to a CD that was recorded in some local club."
2,Tribute Falls Flat,"In this tribute to Rush, the whole album falls short of what it could have acheived. I appreciate when folks do covers and stay true, but add a little something. The word 'little' should be read as Change less than 5% of the original. Musicians have their own sound, and singers have their own voice, and that is change enough for me. But wait, I think that I will take this great band and their great music and put out an album that if anyone who had never heard Rush before listened to would make them run for cover. (no pun intended, but it works). This CD is a waste of time, effort, energy, and talent. They actually have talented musicians on this CD, but I guess their philosophey has been 'the better you are, the lower in the mix you go'. And, if you cannot play worth a flip, then Louder will make you sound better. These are false statements, but they are a testament of how they set up this album. AVOID this album at all costs. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Absolutely Disgusting,"I became physically ill listening to this. Magna Carta loves to cash in on the decent music their label lacks by disguising this type of garbage as a ""tribute"". I would rather listen to night ranger in a Florida trailer park."
4,Very impressive tribute,"I am quite into Classic Rock Tributes,so I thought I would check out this one,mainly because I saw that Randy Jackson (Of Zebra) featured. The other vocalists (Kip Winger/Jani Lane and Seb Bach for Instance) gave me second thoughts after I heard the dreadful vocal performances of other 80s Heavy Rockers on the Dance Re-mix of Led Zeppelin. However,every vocal performance was very complimentary and above my expectations.Obviously,Randy Jackson being the pick.If you are a Rush fan,you can't go wrong,as the songs are various periods as well.I just wish that either Rush played Witch Hunt LIVE or that the next tribute features this Classic piece."
4,Great Interpretations,"3.5 starsWith the exception of the cover of ""Tom Sawyer"" this cd is great. Tom Sawyer begins with a weak facsimile of the original drum fills and doesn't get any better. It sounds like a karaoke version of the song. Every other song is very well done. It was great to hear such offbeat cover choices as ""Didacts and Narpets"", ""Lakeside Park"", and ""Different Strings""."
2,For completists only,"If you're collecting everything that has to do with Rush, get this.Otherwise, don't waste your money.Note to record company: if you want REAL Rush covers, hire Dream Theater and record them live in the studio without overdubs. (There are quite a few bootleg recordings of their cover versions circulating around the net --- these guys really CAN hack it.)"
1,A better tribute would have been silence,No true Rush fan would possibly condone the needless hacking of this great band's artwork. A truly worthless recording.
5,A Tribute - A worship,"Subdivisions is a great tribute album to Rush...I heard it on 4 u rock n metal.com and put it on my wish list...I got it and Working Man almost at the same time for a good double whammy of Rush covers....Steve Vai is incredible and Joe Satriani jumps in there, too....get it and enjoy some variations on a theme you love if you're a Rush fan..."
4,Great album for die hard Rush fans,"I had previously purchased Working Man, another Rush tribute album, which I really enjoyed.This album is very good, but not quite as good as Working Man, but definitely worth a listen or two."
2,Haven't heard it,"That's right I haven't heard it, but just look at the artist list. I'm a huge Rush fan but that's all it took for me to decide."
1,mike,Worth about ten cents. Made from about 2 cents. Lasted about two days. There are better alternatives on the market. Very cheap plastic and plastic lense came off after a day.
1,horrible,"i order 4 of them n all 4 of them came different color (blue,skyblue,light blue n greenish) so if i was ya dnt buy it!"
3,"Not the best, but good enough.","This isn't the best product you will find in the market, but its good enough for its price and when you receive this item you will definitely feel that you get what you paid for.For a little over 5 dollars I couldn't complain about the little cloth that was undone at the top, nor the quality of the whip itself.Nevertheless, it works as described and I had quite some fun with this item, although not as much as I think I would have."
2,"It's crappy, but it's cheap","Get a better one, there is no weight to this one at all so the person you handcuffed to the car radiator wont feel a thing."
1,Just bad...,"One - very short and smallTwo - very dry and brittleThree - not good for real use, more as a gag gift"
3,It's Really Small,"The handle is only about 9 inches, so it's small and cute. It's made pretty well for what it cost, so no complaints, and I think it would made a great stocking stuffer, but it's really only good for light play."
1,"Pure fantasy,lies, a disgrace and outright Serb propaganda!",Please save your money and don't buy this outright fabrication of the History of Kosova. A complete waste of time!
4,Arrived slightly tarnished -- but otherwise good,"These appear to be well made. The backs stay on well -- don't slide off on their own. The posts don't irritate my sensitive ears at all.However, when they were first shipped, they were slightly tarnished. I wiped them with a soft cloth and they look fine now."
5,Great disk!,"You may not have heard his name before, but you will! Passionate lyrics and a great sound make this one of my favorite CDs. Get it now so you can amaze your friends with his first CD!"
1,Book's content not adequate for easy learning,"Book contained 15,000 conjugations but in very small print. Also, there were no Spanish to English translation for the 15,000 verbs. You had to already know what the verb meant. I found this book only slightly useful and would not reccomend it. There are much better books out there for the same price."
5,A pleasant surprise! The best for less.,"I thought 501 Spanish Verbs published by Barron's Education Series was indispensable for learning Spanish until I came across 15,000 Spanish Verbs, by accident."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!,"This book is horrible. I have the 501 Spanish verbs and it is much better. This book is tiny. It lists numerous verbs on one page, then you have to flip to another page to learn how to conjugate it. IT'S RIDICULOUS!!! I was hoping it would have a similar format to the 501 Spanish Verbs. Seriously disappointed."
2,Bryn Thomas' Trans-Siberian Handbook the way to go,"You'll get more of the generic country information that LP is good at (and provides in their various country-specific guides) but we found the research in the Handbook provides a much more informative passage across the time-zones. By far the best and most up-to-date source of information on booking tickets is a website called ""www.seat61.com"". Having tried various ""tour"" organisations, we ended up booking all arrangements through one of the recommended Russian agencies for half the price - all through internet cafes on the hoof in Bolivia! As for companion guides, much preferred the handbook."
3,"Lot of information, but not correct","I was impressed about amount of information, but there are so many errors, especially in russian words and transcription, I can count up to 5 errors on page. Seems that publisher was in a hurry and didn't correct original text or author(corrector?) was not competent in this stuff."
3,"Good, but also get the Handbook",What you'd expect from Lonely Planet--useful but not comprehensive. I would recommend getting both this and the Trans-Siberian Handbook. It can be a little difficult to find (especially if you don't want to wait 6 weeks).
4,very useful guide,"As the title says, I found the book a very useful guide. Since I currently live in China, I was mostly just using the portions for Mongolia, and Russia.My only complaint is the switching around of currency used. Sometime in the Russian portion prices would be listed in US dollars, other times Rubles, and sometimes in Euros. It would have been much better to pick one currency and stick with it. A minor complaint."
5,i love it,"I saw this exhibit at the Fraenkel Gallery and while a book can never really have the same feel, this one comes close with it's large size and photos that cover the whole page. The layout is just great and the photographs are perfect to enjoy over and over."
5,Very good art in this one!,"This edition has like, 11,000 images! Stuff for fathers day, Kwanzaa, christmas, Easter, new years eve , well..everything. I had not a trouble one installing this and using it with create-a-card. Some truly beautiful artwork and a huge collection! All for under twenty bucks! Bargain! It's also really easy to use. And, i am using it in Windows XP ,too!"
2,There was beautiful atr work in the original -- not in #2,No book is included in this edition. The 1997 original had much more artwork to choose from.
1,Click Art,Sorry to report that I haven't been able to load the program into either the PC or Mac. Is there anything different I have to do? There are no instructions at all with either disks. I'm disapponted not to be able to use them.Angelica Mishoe
5,clickart celebration cd,this software has beautiful colored victorian graphics that mymom always is using. Thousands of beatiful clipart for anyschool project
5,Informative,Purchased for my son who wanted a professional workout routine that he could use with our home gym. This DVD instructs you on how to build muscle safely. Highly recommend for anyone who wants a great workout.
1,bodybuilding,"Maybe I should have known by the front cover?!? Not for me! I love to lift weights, and get a great workout, but this was wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy beyond my interest level. The reviews I read stated this was for all levels. I disagree. I was looking for a workout video similar to p90x, this is NOT something to work out with while watching. It is instructional only."
2,Quite Confusing,"The title was promising but the book did not fulfill its potential. I found the material to be unorganized and confusing to read.She seemed to focus a lot on telling her own anecedotes but failed to get to whatever the point was. I believe she meant well but didn't quite make it.Sorry, I hate to knock anybody but I think this one needed another revision."
2,"Made a mistake, smaller cars!",Not the actual diecast cars by mattel. They are smaller versions of those. oops!
5,Smaller than supercharged...,"Theses are great, well-made, etc. but are slightly smaller than the supercharged 1:55 cars characters like you would purchase at t@rget or walm@rt."
1,Cars Flo & Ramone 2 Pack Collectors set,These cars are junk . Do not buy if you are collecting the Mattel version. These are Not the actual diecast cars by mattel. They are smaller versions of those. not worth the $10.00 + shipping .
1,Bad Product,"Received this product and the none of the 3 cd units would function. Returned it and received a replacement unit. Set up and turned on the unit and again none of the 3 cd units would funcction. A piece of junk, obvious design or manufacturing flaws. WORTHLESS !!!!!"
4,Super Duper,"These other guys had a bad experience - bummer for them. I got mine about a year ago and it works fine. Hey the sound is not the best, but for under $150 and for use in the office - it's been perfect for me! I have no complaints, and I've gotten a lot of compliments about the appearance of it. It's a cool looking stereo."
2,misleading picture,"Your looking at the 2006 sixsixone comp glove in the picture but when you order this product, what your going to get is the 2008 version of it. Which looks totaly different and is much more uglier that the 2006 models. I've contacted the seller with this issue and well till today i've never received a reply back. Sow if you see this product i would suggest not buying it because what your seeing in the picture is not what your going to get.You've been warned so its your decition now."
2,Oh my poor ears !!!!!,"The sound track on this dvd is deplorable and annoying. The sound of the zills is not sharp and clear, instead its muffled and difficult to hear the difference between a tek and a dum. With an instructional zill dvd you would think that the soundtrack quality would be critical. In all honesty, I wanted to like this dvd. I like Ansuya and enjoyed her first zill dvd. I tried two copies and played it on three different dvd players with the same result - a terrible sound track. I don't understand why IAMED released such a poor product when they have a great track record of quality dvds. As far as using this dvd for drilling, it's too painful for me to listen to. I will be resellling my copy once I write out the rhythm patterns."
1,Worthless Book,I live in New Mexico and this book lists only 4 sites to mine / rock hound. I know of at least 35 sites in the state none of witch the book lists not to mention the books 4 sites are all pay sites where you must pay a fee to dig. The author did little to no research on the available sites in this state. In the back of this book is a form called readers contribution where the author wants you the reader to send them the locations of mines you know of so they don't have to do any research and may profit off your work or knowledge. Do not waste your time on this book if you are serious about rock mineral and gem hunting.
5,A wonderful bedtime book,"What a wonderful bedtime story! The lovely, rhyming verse and supporting illustrations provide a comforting, evocative,and beautiful prelude to sleep."
1,A Book About Books,"I read this book about a year ago and was, by and large, disappointed. The author did not really share any insights in the life of Elmer Keith. The author is a bibliophile, and as any writing seminar will tell you - ""write about what you know"" which is what this author did. I cannot recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about Elmer. I do envy the author his experience with personally knowing Elmer."
2,Would be 5 stars if camera didn't change every 3 seconds,"Music is great, behind the scenes stuff is fantastic, but the concert video is totally ruined by horrible video editing. The camera angle changes every 3 seconds and many times you can't even focus on that 3 seconds of video because the cameras are constantly panning, rotating or zooming. Also, it's nice to see audience shots every now and then, but on this DVD I think you see the audience at least 25% of the time if not more...so much in fact that there are a few audience members who should probably get royalty checks from sales of this DVD. It's sad that such a great show has been made nearly unwatchable by amateurish video editing. Act 3 is on the DVD's twice too...you think they could have put on a different version that didn't make you dizzy watching it."
3,not bad for the casual fan,"first of all, the track listing is incorrect. How about a little attention to details guys. Afterall, we're shelling out $20+ for the dvd to which many of us already own the cd. A little too much with the switching of camera angles, it made me dizzy. There weren't all the usual KISS antics most noticably Ace's flaming guitars. As a KISS fan, however, overall I enjoyed it. It sounds great on a home theater system."
2,"Great Sound, BAD view","I'll make this very simple. The sound is fantastic and the tunes are good. Tommy and Eric do it justice even though they are not the original members. The editing is worse than bad!! They cannot stay on a subject for more than 2 seconds, if that. They also pan around like you are on a roller coaster, so if you have a seizure disorder, you are hosed. There are not even any real long shots of the band, but you get a lot of close ups on around the same 20 people in the audience. That is nice because they are good looking, however, the concert footage really blew...."
3,Sad concert,"First, I am really glad I taped the New Jersey farewell concert. Who hired the Moron for editing? Who let this get out? As with all the other reviews this DVD is nearly impossible to watch. You barley have a chance to see the new Ace (or anybody) play for more than 2 seconds. It can only be good if you were there & want to see yourself, (good chance of that as the show is 75% fan shots). I could only recommend this for a real diehard KISS fan. I still think Tommy needs his own character. I'll be watching the Jersey VHS (which should be put out on DVD), while this one sits on a shelf."
3,Better than the CD,"When I first heard about this idea, I hated it. I hated the CD even more when I heard it. But the music of Kiss has to be seen AND heard in order to be effective. Kiss Symphony proves to be no exception.Most of what Gene Simmoms says should be taken with a grain of salt. However, he may have had a point when he bad-mouthed Ace Freeley. In this man's opinion, the Farewell Tour often sounded horrible (I saw it three times). Now that Ace is gone, Kiss's sound has actually improved. Kiss loyalists have been upset about this fact, but I have to say that (soundwise at least) they are better off without him.Kiss symphony delivers all of the great stuff that you would expect from a Kiss show. However, there is still a very real risk that the guys may still end their careers as a washed up joke. Their shot at going our with dignity is slowly fading, maybe without their knowledge."
2,They blew it!!!,"The music on this DVD is really good, but the video is nearly impossible to watch due to the horrible editing job that cant keep a shot of ANYTHING on the screen for more than what seems like two seconds.I am going to put my copy on EBAY and get the CD instead."
3,Close but no cigar!!!,"The concept was a bit played behind this whole project from the git go. I mean Metallica did it so did GNR so it comes off as Kiss playing catch up.Some of the arrangements are quite good while others are quite horrible. But I gave it 3 stars since it is the closest thing to an original project kiss has done since Psycho Circus.Some people have asked why it was done in Aussie land, thats simple they can't draw the crowds here like they can there.Its a shame that a band that was so vital to myself and countless others has dwindled down to a cheap overpriced sideshow. They should have just ended it with the farewell tour. with dignity and at the top of thier game.Such a shame."
3,KISS Rocks with Style and Grace!,"Gene, Paul, and Peter were great to see with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. But the newly-hired guitarist Tommy Thayer knows nothing to keep in the leads, As Ace did! Especially on the pick-up leads on the 2nd Disc of ""Kings of the Night time World."" Which made it disappointing to see. Although the audio is great, and definitely worth watching."
5,unbeatable,"This DVD introduced me to the band Kiss. i can honestly say that after seeing this DVD i was hooked on Kiss. Easily the best concert ever.All the songs are solid - with the orchestra the songs i was made for loving you, god of thunder, black diamond, shandi, sure know something, beth and forever stand out and are fab. The first section, without the orchestra is also very very good. Ignore any other bad reviews on this. Just because Ace frehley is not in the line up does not make this a bad DVD. Tommy thayer plays very well and repleces Ace as the guiterist.buy the DVD and see for yourself. It is excellent and displays kiss at there very best."
1,Don't give Gene any more money!,"Ki$$ should have pulled the plug after the '95 reunion tour. Spend your hard earned dollars on something Gene can't collect on, like a bootleg of a 70's concert."
1,We miss the Ace,This review will be short and to the point.No Ace. No balls.No Ace. No punch.No Ace. No Grace.No Ace. No KISS.
2,"Excellent music, third rate video","First off, this is the best live performance Kiss has ever put out. The music absolutely buries Alives 1-3, Unplugged, and Animalize Live Uncensored. The band is in absolute best form.Unfortunately, the video looks as though it was edited by George Lucas on PCP. The camera angles change so frequently that your eyes rarely get to focus on the screen, and there are these computerized zooms across the audience that drive me up a wall. Also, the Gene Simmons bass solo is ruined by some over-gaining effect on the camera that buries the guy in some overbright greenish glow.Overall, the best live release by Kiss ever, just don't expect much visual enjoyment."
1,Close caption or subtitles??,"Wonder, does this DVD have the closed caption or subtitles (in English, of course)???I know some of you don't care but I DO!!!!!!! Why?! Because I am deaf and been fan of KISS for nearly 25 years."
3,Camera Man/Editor must have A.D.D.,"After reading the reviews, I still bought it because, hey, it's KISS! Anyway, I agree with the first reviewer. It could have and should have been an awesome DVD. The sound, picture quality and content was great. However, I think the person editing this DVD thought they were doing a series of KISS video's for MTV. Got to jam pack as many shots of everything in sight into each song. Slow down! Just as you get a shot of something you'd like to see, it's snatched away from you - on to something else. Sometimes you don't even have time to focus on what you're looking at. At best you get a 3 second shot of something. After watching and listening to it, at the end I still feel like I haven't seen the concert. There are no good shots of the whole stage, and things just don't stay focused enough on one thing long enough for you to enjoy it. It's unfortunate, but true. I'm surprised that Gene & Paul gave it the OK."
3,Let Down!!,"This dvd was a big let down, but I should have know better. Being a KISS fan since 1976 they have always seemed to come up a little short of fully delivering the goods. I deducted one star for the sound which is not DTS (no center channel) and lack of good bass, deducted the other star for the horrid editing which so many have already talked about. I don't need to see all those shots of the fans. Would have liked to see more of the band and stage as a whole to get a real feel for the concert. You really don't have time to enjoy momment before it cuts a away to something else. KISS if you listening, PLEASE redo this DVD with better editing and True DTS sound."
3,"""Take aspirin for any headache...midol for any cramps""","I agree with Robert from Plano. When I paid $27 for this yesterday, I didnt know 12 of that was to see the first 20 rows of obnoxious fans, and the rest to actually see the band we love. Dont get me wrong, I love seeing hot girls in the audience, but having a closeup of every assclown in the crowd is rediculous, especially during ""Deuce."" I guess the director figured he had to use all 45 camera angles in every song. The best thing about concert dvds is that you feel like you are there, but this video was made like it was to be shown on MTV. Now, that I got that off my chest, I'll talk about the positives. THe sound is awesome, the picture is perfect, and the special features are worth the buy alone. It is still a must buy for any KISS fan. Its just disappointing when you wait years for something like this to come out, and its not perfect. Oh well."
3,Different!,"First off I must say that I really missed Ace Frehley. I was shocked to see Tommy and Eric in Ace's and Peter's costumes - I don't like it. Tommy IS NOT Ace. I thought the Melbourne Children's Choir singing ""Great Expectations"" was a little out of line. The performance is not in chronological order for some reason????? Other than that I loved it! Did I mention how much I missed Ace?"
5,Amazing!!!,"The Hottest band in the World and this once again proves it!!!! KISS ROCKS!! Amazing sound, breathtaking visuals and you wanted the best you got the best, KISS!!!"
3,"Great show, average disc ! (where's the center channel?)","As other reviewers have noted the show is great, but the camera editing is just too hyperactive. Quick editing can help the viewer get energized, but there is a point where it gets tiring when the cuts are every second or so.The audio seems great at first, but then I noticed NO sound from my center channel in DTS or DD 5.1 mode. I tested with another dvd and found my system to be functioning properly. Any one else have this problem? Could an error that big make it through quality control and Gene's attention to detail?"
4,GREAT SOUND BUT JAIL THE EDITOR,"When it comes to your favorite bands when you are a teenager I guess KISS was after my time by about 5 year. But because of my younger brother I was always exposed to KISS to a certain extant. SO, when this DVD came on the shelves I had to get it and see the concert. WOW, what a show. I own a lot of concert DVDs. I have a large and very expensive home Theater and most of my concerts at in DTS. This concert has great sound and it is just a super show. The only reason I did not give it 5 Starts is because of the editing of the show. Put simply, the editor and/or the editing team should be shot. They never spend any longer that 3 seconds on a frame. I don't think that there is anymore than one or two nice shots of the entire stage with band. TOO bad, cause everything else is great. BUTTTTTT, the editing is sooooo bad that it is painful to try watching it. I only listen to the show."
2,Same Old Same Old,"As so many others have already mentioned, what's with the choppy editing? How about focusing on the band for more than 2 seconds at a time? The best thing about this concert is that there are actually some different songs on it, like GREAT EXPECTATIONS and SURE KNOW SOMETHING, but otherwise its the same songs everyone has heard a million times. Kiss's problem is what made them so great in the first place: their stage show. We've seen it and we want something more. They need to revamp their set list and think of some new ways to wow the audience. There should have been more Tommy and Peter as well. I'm sure being at the show was a lot more exciting."
1,A HOAX CONCERT!,"This ""Concert"" Dvd is Such a Rip-Off it Smells!! Kiss is Rocks #1 Rip-offs ANYWAY, in EVERY way, THIS Dvd just adds to their BULL! You keep seeing the SAME people in the crowd over & over, like THEY and the band were the ONLY ones there! WITH TODAYS' COMPUTER IMAGING, I WOULDN'T DOUBT THAT ONLY THE BAND, SOME ORCHESTRA (How do WE REALLY know that was Australia's Syn(phony)?)..I'm stressing the ""Phony"" part, EXTREMELY! And 15 or so people were ACTUALLY there! Wherever ""They""were! Let's NOT forget what Kiss said about dubbing the Alive Lp. THIS, just COULD be ANOTHER Hoax. And I'd Put BIG MONEY on it, that it is! Kiss has the nerve to show this DVD in Theatres!!...Wait for this Dvd to hit ""Bargin Bins"" at some discount store. THE BIGGEST SCAM IN ROCK n ROLL,....KISS!"
1,KISS is dead,"And this is the best proof of it. Gene & Paul voices are blown, Tommy Thayer is boring as a lead guitarrist and Peter...mmm...he lost his drumming' skills decades ago. He's more than worn.Editing's so fast that it makes you dizzy. The concert? well...same old song and dance. Nothing new, same stage' raps, same explosions, same everything.Don't waste your money on this. You probably work too hard to get your paycheck, don't throw it."
5,John Brown Body's BEST ALBUM!,"I just wanted to throw in a quick review. I have listened to this album for over 10 years and I consider it one of my favorite albums of all time - and by far the best John Brown's Body album. Please pick up this album - you won't regret it. The individual who gave it a 1 Star has no idea what they are talking about! Enjoy! I know that you will.Peace and Love,DZA tha Dangerous"
2,"Easy to use, but poor reliability","We had this machine for about two months and it was great when it was working but eventually we started getting an error message that the door was not closed even though it was. I was able to reset it once by unplugging it for a few hours and plugging it in again, but a few days later we got the same error message.We had a Jura Capresso F7 before this and ending up returning two of those because similar problems before purchasing this machine. These new automatic machines are easy to use and make great espresso, but it seems like the technology is still pretty buggy so beware."
5,Love this machine,"My husband and I everyday were standing in line for our lattes at Starbucks. We have had this machine for over a year now and every day make our favorite latte drink. The machine has more than paid for itself by not having to purchase the expensive starbucks anymore. We have not had any problems, it is easy to use. Would highly recommend to anyone that loves their coffee drinks."
1,Classically non-functional,"Unit didn't make coffee-made weak soup. unfortunately vendor would not confirm defect after return, so must conclude they are all useless. Grinder could not consistently feed doser with a full shot, and sensors did not work. Major disappointment as we loved our previous incanto through its natural life."
3,"tastes great, doesnt fully work anymore",When i first received this machine I thought it was incredible. I was in love with it for the first 3 months when it worked reliably. It has since been in for service twice in the first year for a total of about 2.5 months. The problem being that it wont stop grinding because it seems that the sensor that tells the grounds to dump into the brew group is screwed up. This has broken twice. It is broken again and now the machine is out of warranty. Fortunately it is still kinda automatic. The coffee still tastes fantastic using pre ground coffee in the chute up front. I would not buy this machine again.
3,Is growing old funny?,"Not really, although some of Cosby's shared lessons are amusing, I just did not find this book as humorous as the others by him that I have recently read. Learning to live with aches and pains, not to mention new dietary habits and a befuddled mind, just isn't as funny as, say, Fat Albert (who may not have reached the ""Big-Five-O"", considering what he was packing away) or Chocolate Cake for Breakfast (those were the days, right Cos?). Still, Cosby is a funny commentator on life and his observations are worthwhile reading, even if the funnier stuff can be found on his Bill Cosby: 49 routine. Recommended."
3,Christmas With Victoria 1998,This is the least favorite of all my Christmas With Victoria books. That's probably just due to my taste (entirely personal).
3,Good.,"This product covers the material in great depth and gives the child a chance to answer the question before giving the answer. It starts off simply with visual presentations of each numeral, then the addition or subtraction, and a visual of the final answer, then progresses to higher skill levels, all the way to addition fact memorization. The choice of presentation style is a little slow. I found ""Math Circus"" by Leap Frog to have a much more engaging presentation but Leap Frog doesn't have anything which covers the material as thoroughly. We watch this Rock'n Learn video while eating lunch or supper where it isn't as engaging and is more repetitive in nature."
3,Catchy,"This product is good, but the songs and info goes by to quickly. Needs to slow the pace of the spelling of the words a little bit more."
1,Rock and Learn Addition and Subtraction,"The Phonics DVD in this brand was excellent. This, however was not educational. The DVD is very fast. No methodology for teaching basic concepts. Random additions and subtractions. Could make the process of learning these math problems more difficult. I also bought Telling time and Earth Science and they are also too fast. No pause to ensure concepts are understood and reiterated, just a continuous noisy rap or chatter."
3,dull!! not very interesting,i thought this was going to be more fun mentally than addition flying across the screen. The box was also crushed and banged up. will not purchase again from buyer.
1,Terrible,I have never had a software program cause such problems:1.) After installation leaving the CD-ROM in as instructed would cause the computer not to reboot. Upon removing the CD-ROM the computer would get stuck during McAfee's bootscan causing me to have to modify the autoexec.bat in order to use my computer.2.) Once I made those modifications I found by computer had been greatly slowed down and certain programs would crash every minute or so. These problems would go away once I shut down McAfee.Please don't waste your money!!
1,Bugs Galore?,"After installation, McAfee asked me if I wanted to download some updates. After downloading the update for VShield, it completely crashed and would not load again. I had to uninstall it, reinstall, and then choose not to update at all.Since I'm not updating, there's a little icon in the system tray that says ""update available"" - I tell it to Close so I don't have to see it, and it just comes right back less than 30 seconds later. Kind of annoying.After installation I did a system scan which actually found a virus. After cleaning the file (explorer.exe, obviously very important) it became corrupted and I couldn't get back into windows. Had to restore from a backup.I definately do not reccommend this product."
2,Norton is better!!,I was really disappointed with this product. McAfee used to have such a great reputation for their products.. I don't know what happened.VirusScan 6.0 is a terrible program. I have a very new PC and VirusScan eats up a lot of the resources and slows down my computer. It's not worth the money.
1,Extremely Disapointed,"I have also used McAfee products for several years, but no more. I ordered version 6 when it came out with a full rebate. How could I go wrong? Well, for one, I ordered on Sept. 28 and just this weekend (11/25) got my computer back up and running after a really bad crash. The virusscan apparently was continuously running in the BIOS and I was unable to stop it. I am very troubled by this turn of McAfee's standards. I will begin searching for a new product immediately."
1,ILLEGAL OPERATION Rulaunch,"With Pers/firewall I gave it a 4 starAfter installed, a lest once or more it pop up illegal operation ""rulaunch"" some times have to re-start systems.ILLEGAL OPERATION: RULAUNCHRULAUNCH caused an invalid page fault inmodule xxxxxxxx at 0167:01eca2b8.Registers:xxxxxxxI have total 5 copies, Install two which had the same error messages. So, I stop installing the other 3 computers, and awaiting for Mcafee to reply to my e-mail."
1,What a steaming pile.....,"The only thing that's good about this title is it's pretty package. I got this via UPS today, installed on my Windows 2000 Pro, didn't work, give me an error log. Tried remove it and do it over again, wouldn't work either. Now it's listed on ebay. Although I got the full rebate for it, I'm still extremely unhappy about it. Definately a steaming pile.....DO NOT BUY IT!!"
1,"Having used McAfee religiously, this release is surreal...","...Since installing it I see the files on the HD under program files, VShield and Guardian on the Systray but no other functionality whatsoever. NAI, what happened?I've been using upto v4 religiously and decided to upgrade to v6 since the earlier one did not support Win2K.The install went OK though I was suspicious when after choosing Scan my Disk/Create Bootdisc option, nothing took place after the install.I went into Start->Menu Virus Scan to check out the Inductive User Interface as described in the manual and...nothing!On systray, Right click VShield->Run...nothing! Right-click on an exe->Scan for Viruses...nothing!Uninstall/Reinstall and still nothing.I've had the 24x7 support chat screen on my screen thru the cable modem for the duration of Gladiator and more and it's still ""The next available agent will be with you in a moment.""Ahhg!What a disapointment..."
4,Everyone needs a virus scanner,"Some people like Norton & some McAfee; personally I use McAfee. As with most software products these days, download the latest & greatest patches/updates from their web site before seriously beating on it. I don't use McAfee's firewall - I use a hardware one from Cisco instead. Virus scanners really are a necessity in this day & age, sadly, and I was able to configure McAfee so that it crippled my box far less than Norton."
4,rulaunch errors,"Contrary to most of the reviews I have seen on this site, I think this is a great product. I did have the rulaunch error occurring just about every time a new application started. Eventually I succumbed and started my search for solutions. Google search on ""rulaunch error"" got me to this site. I then contacted McAfee customer service via the on line chat connection and within about 3 minutes Cedric E. was on line, I described the problem and he suggested I download VS0602.au.exe to patch various files. Indeed, the patch installation went smoothly, everything is updated, and works just great. By the way, I didn't have anywhere near the problems that other users seem to have had. I use Win98SE on a clone machine with a Pentium II."
1,"Lousy, Lousy, Lousy","Back in 1997 we used McAfee for a virus scan and loved it. After Norton Antivirus (with its bells and whistles) brought our computer to its knees we decided to buy McAfee again. What a huge mistake!! We couldn't install due to the fact that we don't have Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.? on our computer...and nowhere on the box is that listed as a requirement. ...It boiled down to: Well just install Internet Explorer. That was after the same trouble everyone else is having with McAfee. Bottom line--we DID return ours and exchanged it for Norton Anti-virus...which Does say it requires Internet Explorer but at least its not shady business practice. Never Again, McAfee!!!"
1,should be 0 stars,"I have used mcafee for 5 years and loved it. bought new version 6.0, had to be installed and removed twice. All the registry entries cleaned(instructions from chat support , a joke). Now is installed on my XP system. shuts itself down constantly, On reboots, sometimes doesnt activate all the scan functions. Mcafee won't support it or fix it. Glad it was free after rebate. Norton has a $20.00 rebate if you send them your Mcafee virusscan disc. It's going in the mail today as I install Norton 2002. This software...[is no good] and Network Associates is sticking it to users. They must be on their way out and this is a last ditch effort at market share."
1,So sluggish it's almost useless,"I have used two version sof McAfee and both were a waste of money. They dragged my machine down so heavily that it became effectively useless. The mouse movements actually mimicked action that was like a viral infection draining the CPU. I switched to OnTrack's Fix-It v4, and everything has run beautifully since."
1,a complete waste of time and money,"Don't purchase this product unless you want to waste a couple of hours of your life. I spent 5 hours attempting to install the program the day I purchased it, and another 2 hours with the technincal support service the next day. After all that, all I had was 6 pages of downloaded instruction on how to UNINSTALL the product. Save yourself some time and money and look at other virus removal software."
1,This is the worst software I ever have,"This software is not working with window 2000(sp1 and sp2), I try it on three machines, none of them can start this program, I try to find the solution through Mcafee.com, unfortunately, there is no documents about this problem. So I through it into my Trach can at home"
4,a good stuff worth the money,"I bought the Mcafee viruscan for over two months and never find any problem. It works seamlessly with my computer, in which a windows me is installed. It discovered several virus came from internet and destroyed them for me. I think this product is pretty good but the firewall is lousy."
4,Works like a charm...,"I just got a new PC with Windows XP installed. I bought mcafee around the same time. It installed perfectly on my machine. It had a tiny problem with running the firewall part, but this was fixed by restarting Windows. It's running perfectly on my machine. Its interface is very easy to use. I particularly like the firewall status graph. It was also very easy to update it. I have a DSL connection so it lets me know when there is an update available."
1,Bug?,"I got this software recently. But it seems to have lots ofproblems about the install. Many of the execute files don'thave any responses, including the help memu. I don't know why.McAfee is a well-known company, it should check everyparts before releasing their products.I think I will use the Norton or Trend Anti-virus again.Hopefully,I can get the rebate. :("
2,Not Worth It,"I tried McAfee because it initially came installed on my computer, and when I got DSL I figured I needed protection. This product turned out not to be it. After upgrading to Windows XP problems started cropping up. For no apparent reason, my preferences, the programs I selected to access the internet all disappeared. The couldn't be restored. I had to uninstall the firewall, reinstall it and then update it. And even that wasn't always a solution or at least not a permanent one. The reviews I've read of internet security always recommend Norton Internet Security. After having yet another problem with McAfee, I uninstalled the entire thing and got Norton, which was immediately configured to allow me to get online without any problems.My advice. Bypass McAfee. There are better systems out there"
1,Beware,"Just after I bought this software, but before I installed it, I got hit with a virus. I had to reinstall windows. I next tried to install VirusScan to clean up what ever hit me. It would not install because I could not connect to the internet (my connection sofware was ruined too). Apparently there is an installation step that needed an internet connection in order to proceed. So I could not remove the virus before I installed more software.I finally got internet access, but I still could not install Virusscan because I did not have the right internet browser. I use a different browser than what McAffee recommends. I went to help site, and tried using the Chat service, but it did not work, either, because I do not have the right internet browser.None of this propritary browser requirements is made clear in the software information."
1,I rated it a 1 star only because there isnt a zero star,"in a word it just SUCKS!!! installation was a pain. c-prompt boxes that just stay open without any instructions (when you close them installation continues. there were a bunch of errors so i wasnt really sure that it installed properly when it finally finished. didnt want to connect to the update website. there isnt even an uninstall when you do realize that it SUCKS!!! my solution was to uninstall using norton cleansweep 2001 and then i went out and bought norton systemworks 2002. thank God that i used the rebate offer so i didnt end up wasting any real money on this trash. i am very disappointed in this latest mcafee effort. do yourself a favor, look for another antivirus solution. norton is good but the choice is up to you."
2,I'll use Norton...,"There might be some on this review board that disagree with me, though I found this anti-virus program to be a memory drainer and dragged my system unlike Norton's software. I thought I would try something different and was disappointed in the performance. The system scan and virus protection is great, but my computer didn't handle it very well and would get slowed down by the software trying to search for viruses in every movement. Unfortunately there isn't enough in this software package that allows you to really determine performance issues or which software you don't want the anti-virus to worry about."
1,Got it free - and still had to junk it,"They say free is a very good price - but only if you can use the product.I was able to get McAfee Virus Scan 6.0 free after rebates. I intended it to replace my memory-hogging Norton, but I was sorely disappointed. It worked sporadically, hogged just as much (if not more) memory than Norton, and refused to ""keep"" the settings after I changed them. My system became a bogged down mess; after I removed Virus Scan and re-installed Norton, it worked fine."
1,THIS IS THE WORST SOFTWARE I HAVE EVER USED,"I have had this for four days and have been unable to get the uninstall part to work. There is NO phone support as they claim is available 24 hours a day. I have logged on at all hours of the day and night for help in trying to get this original version out so I can put the new version in---never got a reply in HOURS of waiting. I got two emails telling me to use the 24 hour service. No help at all. I can pay $(...) a minute, but I have no guarantee that this will respond either. Now I am unable to install and feel that I am vulnerable while I wait for support which I surely will have to pay for elsewhere. Moral: don't buy it unless you are expert at installation because support does not exist. Beware."
1,"very disappointing support, be smart buy something else","I had used Mcafee in the past and have had great results, this product has many problems and very poor support options. The online help takes forever and the technicians are not well educated. The phone support is even worse and its costs almost $3.00 a minute. I will not buy this product again and warn anybody who is thinking about using it. I would have returned it but missed the 30 day window. Time flies when you are having technical issues. The firewall is the worst of the lot constant error that keep you form even using it."
1,Don't do it! Stay away from McAfee Products!,"After installing the VirusScan 6.0 download product on my PC, every action takes nearly twice as long. It seems like the real-time protection engine has some bugs.... I've actually gone so far as to re-install my system from scratch to try and resolve these issues. But the only fix seems to be to either not install the product in the first place, or to stop the ""On-Access Systems Scanner"" completely. To add insult to injury, NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT. Unless you don't mind ""900-number"" style pay-per-use access!"
1,Unhappy Customer,"We purchased this software and ultimately had to remove it from our computer - now we use Norton and have had no problems. Please don't buy the McAfee software. What happened is that were sent an upgrade via e-mail and found out (only after we downloaded the upgrade) that it would screw up our computer because we operate on Windows XP. We tried to get help on their long distance line and after pushing all the right buttons to get to a live body, we were disconnected - 3 times. Looking on line did not help - and our only other option was to pay $35 for telephone support. Why bother."
1,Certified garbage!!!,"Believe me, after reading some of the reviews on this product, I am not surprised that I am not the only one using McAfee's name in vain!First, ViruScan 6 will stop FreeCell and Solitaire from working. So I download the patch. The system runs fine for a few days, but it will not boot at all (locking on pass14)!! Then, mcafeehelp.com has the gall to tell me that I have to pay for the privelege of calling them for help!Forget it! This garbageware is not worth a nickel!"
3,"Tricky to Install, but it works...","I installed the product, but it didn't work. Everything was disabled and the product did not seem installed properly. It would not complete a system scan, and I got error messages.After attempting to get help from Mcafee without success, I just uninstalled the product and started all over. That did the trick.It has not given me any problems since. If you think you might need help from McAfee, then you might want to pass. If you think you can solve your own support issues, then go for it."
1,Good I guess,"McAfee hasn't changed their software's basic interface in years, and it shows. Relatively simple tasks are a chore to accomplish with McAfee VirusScan. It's clunky, confusing, and the shield icon that sits in the taskbar is (ugly).All looks aside though, it is a very competent scanner, albeit hard to use.I would recommend going with Norton AntiVirus 2002. A clean interface and a fast scanning mechanism make that the hands-down winner over McAfee. This year."
2,Installation headaches,"Installed and uninstalled 4 times, still can't get it to work correctly. I have used previous versions of McAfee Virus Scan, but this is the worst I have encountered.If you buy and install it, make sure you backup your files before attempting installation. Evan after removing the program, I had trouble with my PC."
1,I hate this product!,I have been using Norton for years without much problem. I was told the McAfee was a better product so I started investigating. I talked to several that said it would do better than Norton. I purchased this product and have had nothing but trouble with it. In other words...it [isn't good].
1,Alpha Test Quality,"I could not believe McAfee release this product as a retrail version. I had so much problem to set it up. By the way, I could not find any help from their web site either. I guess this is 6.0 version. You guys definitely should wait for the v6.1."
5,best anti virus software!,I installed this with XP will no problem and it has worked without any flaws. it has many more features than Norton including a firewall! highly recommended
1,Don't by McAfee VirusScan!,"Installing this product on my Win 98 system caused it to crash. Spending 4 - 5 hours on the phone with support personnelldidn't help, it was so badly ruined. I had to do a quick restore and start over, loosing nearly everything on my computer."
1,Bad software - Worse Tech Support,"Hard to install, locks up the PC and then to top things off, tech support options are ineffective at best, non-existent at worst. I've used previous versions of VirusScan for years with great satisfaction. My experience with VirusScan 6 has convinced me to avoid all McAfee products in the future. Get Norton AntiVirus instead - easy to install and works like a charm."
3,Hope this is better than previous versions,I installed a previous version of mcafee last year and had so many errors from win98 -- even in SAFE boot-- that I had to completely reformat and reinstall everything. I was not a happy camper. I'd recommend backing up everything before installing this or any other software. Hopefully this fixes those isses. Antivirus software is critical!! I'm giving mcafee another chance because of their reputation. I hope this will run on the soon to be released winXp too.
2,Performance very poor and disappointing,"Installed Ver 6 with Win98. Worked OK for about a month, but veryslow. After attempting to improving speed, could not access Internet. McAfee offered no fixes that worked. I uninstalled theFirewall without trouble and after restart, I was able to accessInternet. Speed is much improved. Virus Scan appears to be working OK. Not sure I will update software with patches."
1,I can't even get online to get the patches,I bought this because of the success of an older version that I had. However this piece of garbage cause me continualy problems. I couldn't even stay on line long enough to download any patches. Stay Away from this piece of junk.
1,P.O.S.,"It's really simple. It will work for awhile, then it will cause your system to freeze at startup, meaning (on later versions of Windows) you'll have to boot up in ""safe mode"" and uninstall it. Actually, it wouldn't even let me do that, so I did the bozo no-no of deleting the directory. Suffice it to say, as messy as my config files must be, my PC again boots up in normal Windows mode. Symantec, here I come!"
1,Kept crashing,I installed it on an older Windows 98 computer and on reboot the computer would not come up normally. I finally had to uninstall it in safe mode. I was able to return it ...and purchased Norton 8.0 which has been working great.
1,"Not worth the time, trouble, nor the money.","I run on Windows 2000 Pro.I am a long time user of Norton Anti-Virus, but decided I would give McAfee a try due to some friend's comments.What a waste!I went out and bought the program, came home and installed it.McAfee 6.0 comes with a Firewall. Immediately that errored on me.So, I figured I would just update everything it said it needed to do.After 3 hours I have the firewall and virus scan updated automatcially from Mcafee.That's when terror really begins.It immediately began crashing the system.That's not the worst - IF you use the firewall- beware! It will take over ALL of your settings.That only made the system crash more, so I went to uninstall it.Well, when you do the firewall takes some drivers with it, without prompting you, or telling you what it's doing.I had to reformat my entire system just to be able to get online again! How ridiculous.Do not waste your time or money."
1,McAfee Virus Scan 6.0,"If you ever get it bug free, it would be a good program. But support, both technical and customer relations is unbelievabally bad. On one problem, it took 7 tries to get a fix that worked. Thats a 14% sucsess rate or an 86% frustration rate. Never did get a second problem fixed. Customer Service has one answer- It a technical problem ask the technicians. Purchased a full priced boxed version. Some how they fouled up the registration and after 45 days it quit working with the explanation that it was an evaluation copy, please pay for it again. Their fix- Pay for wrapping and shipping and we will refund your money."
1,Installation Nightmare,"This version is not friendly to Netscape users!!!The software box and documentation claim 6.0 will work on Windows 95 or higher version, but this is not true in addition to Windows, processing speed, etc the documentation should list Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher as part of the necessary equipment. After two years of trying to eradicate IE from my system I can finally run Netscape and Mozilla with no complications, but I can't install Virusscan 6.0.I have seen the program run sucessfully on Windows 2000, but I was disapointed that the improvements over 5.X are not really significant. IMO this program is a waste of money. Don't buy it unless you have already upgraded to Windows XP!"
1,My two cents,After reading some of the posts on how it messed up ppl's computers I was kinda weary to install it. So I backed up my hard drive. Installed it without a problem even with Norton Anti-Virus installed already. I have both running now and probably will get rid of Norton.The user interface is pretty but confusing when I just want to update and protect myself from the latest viruses out there. No problems so far...but it's only been a day.UPDATE: Ok...day 3. I've changed my rating from 4 stars to 1. It scans but after seeing it what it did to my computer I'm not so sure if it's doing what it's supposed to be doing. Has rendered my Internet Explorer and winamp useless. When I reboot now I always get the message insufficient memory. Will have to redo my machine. Stick with Norton. Stay away from this.
1,"Look at other's: DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY","I spent 5 hours, and over 6 on-line ""free"" customer service (crappy) chats. Installation problems and freez... Problems just to install, and problems with your computer (if it is not worster than getting viruses) of freezing and slowing the computer down.You buy it, and find out. Just a piece of advice, hope you don't take into consideration of the minority of the reviewers here, that give 5 stars (they work for this lousy fraudent company)"
3,Intallation problems,"I had problems to install, I had conflict with my McAffe Active Shield installed from factory, I did not have other option to delete my Active Shield. I just hope this works much better than my factory software."
2,Too buggy!,"VirusScan installed with no problem. However, the settings keep changing - One day it is set to run a system scan, the next day I get a message saying the scan has been disabled. McAfee's customer service said to uninstall it and then reinstall in ""safe mode,"" which I did, but the problem persists.Also, the Firewall program prevented me from connecting to my ISP, even when I disabled the Firewall! I had to completely uninstall it.I use Norton's AntiVirus at work and it is far superior. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for the McAfee program (I bought it with an Amazon rebate coupon good for the entire purchase price) because I'm going to replace it with Norton."
4,Seamless Virus Protection for XP,"Installation went smooth from the get go. I have Windows XP Pro on a PIII 933.Pro:- Easy to install- Automatically looked for product updates & Dat files- Automated updates with or without prompts!- Does not slow down browsing, etc.- Includes a personal firewall for free- Rebate makes it next to freeCon:- The interface might be easier to navigateI know a lot of people have had problems, mainly with older O/S's such as Win98 & ME. It works very smooth with XP..."
1,Big Trouble - Don't Even Get it if its FREE !!,"I thought all the probs listed here wouldn't happen to me. HA!Since I got 6.0 for free with rebates, I figured what's there to lose ?? The first load went OK but on reboot DOS said ""Insufficient Memory to check for viruses"". Help chat said unload and reload with all tasks ended. After unloading everything went to H---. Then hours of time trying to reinstall Windows (4 times) and then when that didn't work, reformating the hard drive and reloading my backup. Guess I'll drop $20 for Norton like I should have in the first place. What a tough lesson to learn. Sorry I did't listen to you guys!! (HP Pavilion w/600mhz, Win98)"
1,Not so great,"I also had the same problems as others:1) During the installation process, I was asked to reboot my PC. I was not asked to remove the CD-ROM. During the reboot, my computer froze completely. Black screen and a blinking cursor. Only by removing the CD-ROM did I get back to the Windows 98 desktop.2) I also noticed VirusScan REALLY slowed down my system, which is a P2 350Mhz with 320MB of RAM. It's so slow at times I can't control my mouse, it just doesn't respond. Hopefully their technical support offers a fix or I may be uninstalling it."
1,I agree with everyone who said this is a bad product,"This came pre-loaded into my last desktop pc. It gummed the whole system up and did not rectify anything having to do with viruses. It is a programs that is always intruding into other programs and causing problems so really, McAfee VirusScan is not just a stupid program, it is a program that tries to spread itself all over your computer. If you dont have it, dont get it. If you have it cause it came on your computer, ininstall it."
2,"Adequate, but there are better choices","I purchased this software and used it for just under one year. I didn't have any problems installing or using it and it seemed to do what it promised, although I hadn't yet encountered any viruses. The problem I ran into was a novice's mistake. I bought Norton Utilities because of a friend's recommendation. When I installed Norton on my computer along with McAfee the two fought each other using my computer as their battle ground! I wound up having to rebuild my hard drive.I am learning more every day about these machines called computers and have learned the hard way that you can't combine McAfee and Norton products. Buy one and stick to it. I will say that I recommend Norton Antivirus 2002. I believe it is the superior product and reviews of antivirus software seem to substantiate my claim. Since switching to Norton, I have become a true fan and heartily recommend it over McAfee."
2,"Better than nothing, but definitely second fiddle.","This program works well, but it doesn't work as well as Norton. I had an infection that McAfee couldn't cure without hours of work. Eventually I gave in and bought Norton and the problem was fixed in a matter of minutes.If you already own McAfee, I would just let it lie. If you are trying to decide between McAfee and Norton, then definitely choose Norton."
1,Can't get 6.0 installed in Windows 98SE,"After 2 full days of trying, close to 100 pages of suggestions from McAfee's Chat Room personnel, I can't get it installed and working on my PC with Windows 98SE. I am going to try a different brand."
1,Buyers beware! The product is worse than a virus!,"I have always used McAfee products successfully. I have Windows 95 on my computer and McAfee Office 2000. When I tried to install the new VirusScan 6.0 program, it removed the old virus scan program. After that, my computer refused to re-boot. I had to use a boot disk to get it going, and reinstall the old virus scan to make my computer run again. I contacted McAfee by e-mail for help and am still waiting for a reply. I am glad this product has a full rebate because it isn't worth a dime! I will purchase some other virus program for my computer soon. Guess if a deal seems too good to be true...! Beware!"
1,its ...,"when my dad bought the virus scanner from a shop it said that we would get FREE UPDATES when they were available. ho hum what happins? cost$$$$$$$$$$ and sometimes we dont have that to spend on stuff that dosen't WORK...... it didn't detect a virus in a email that i myself had, thus causing half of my email contacts to get it and their computer CRASH.....if you read this.....DO NOT BUY THIS VIRUS SCANNER OR PRODUCTS......... GO ELESWHERE TRUST ME.... AND MY FAMILY!!!..."
1,The cure was worse than the disease.,"I'm not a computer expert, and I thought this was a name I could trust. I was wrong!! If my family and friends hadn't come to my rescue I still wouldn't be abe to use my computer. Buyer beware! I'll never use another one of their products."
3,Good product for the money!,"Good virus protection, but I think Symantec offers a better interface and more comprehensive abilities."
1,McAfee Virus Scan 6.0-NO,"This is a terrible product. Crashed my windows ME system, gave conflicting problems, lost drivers, exe's and programs since I installed it. Also installed it on a windows 98 pc. DID THE SAME THING. Do not recommend."
1,DON'T get it even if it's FREE!!!,"I installed VirusScan 6.0 with the firewall software and it caused my DSL connection to stop working. When I tried to callsupport, there is NO number listed in the product box anywhere.I later found out that the ONLY free support they provide isonline chat. You are out of luck if you only have a single internet connection at home.I tried the online support at work and no technical support answer the chat session for over 15 minutes. When they finally came to answer the chat, I wasted another 5 minutes with no solution provided while the technical person is probably helping 10 other customers at the same time before the chat session abruptly ended. I then tried to reconnect and waited for another 20 minutes before I gave up.I called to ask for a refund and they told me I should receivemy refund instruction promptly in my EMAIL!!!The company obviously ... doesn't think!Save yourself the headache, don't get the software.It's worthless!"
1,Disappointed,"I recently just bought a new laptop and thought it would be wise to invest in an anti-virus program. After using Norton products in the past and not being completely satisfied with the occasional slow-downs and bugs, I thought I'd try VirusScan. After all, it came reasonably priced (with rebates) and with nice-sounding features. Boy, was I in for problems!! As soon as I installed it, I needed to upgrade it. And then my computer crashed (which is a week old and working perfectly)! And then after rebooting, it froze! It kept re-freezing each time I rebooted my computer. Customer service was totally useless! I finally got my computer working again and just uninstalled it. It's really not worth the hassle. Save your money for something else"
2,Nothing but Problems,"When I ordered this product, all of the reviews were positive.But by the time I received and installed it, there were quite a few bad reviews. I was having the same problems as all of the others were having, not installing correctly, system lock-ups, slow-downs, etc.....Luckly I have Goback installed on my machine. I was able to get my system back to the was it was before I tried to install McAfee. Wasted about 2 hours.I will wait to see what problems and solutions the McAfee site shows before I attempt to re-install. I currently have ver. 4.0.3 installed and I'm able to receive new DAT files. When McAfee no longer supports this version, I will have to make a decision on what I will install."
1,what a disappointment,"I tried to install it on a relatively clean Win2k system with few applications (no antivirus application)installed. It finished installation in a minute and didn't prompt me to reboot. I had the same trouble as some others have pointed out. Vshield and Guardian are in the systray, but nothing happens when I try to run any program."
1,very disapointing upgrade,Installing the program I had no problem. It was when the automatic updates kicked in for the firewall program. I have been waiting two days for them to respond to email. They already have a patch up on their website for a problem if you can get VirusScan Central to open up. Looks like they didn't run everything through QA before releasing the product.
2,Firewall patch will not load,I purchased 6.0 and installed it on my ADM600 using win2000Pro with no problem. I selected the automatic update and I downloaded four updates. The firewall update gave me an error 15. I contacted the help thru the web and was given a new place to download the patch from and did it. I then tried to install this patch and got an error 36. Still not resolved.
2,Problem uninstalling other products,"When installing, the new version detected I already have Norton Anti-Virus installed and asked to uninstall it automatically. I choose Yes and it did a terrible job, messed up the registry completely and caused me hours to fix it. It should just ask the user to uninstall it manually instead of doing a poor job.The firewall that comes with it is quite weak with very limited features."
2,"Fair protection, No support","I realize customer support is not a profit-maker. So has McAfee. My system was down a week and once I had isolated Security Center as the problem, I wasn't able to speak to anyone whose first language was English. Morons with flow charts, a huge phone bill and I finally figured out (on my own) how to edit the registry additions. Spyware included but subtle."
1,I CAN'T RATE THIS I CAN'T EVEN GET THE FULL VERSION,I WAS ONLY ABLE TO DOWNLOAD 750KB OF 33MB NOW I'M STUCK WITHTHIS ON MY COMPUTER CAN'T USE NOTHING. THANKX
1,If VirusScan Central Does Not Open - Read below,"The McAfee VirusScan Home page fails to load after installing VirusScan on International English versions of Windows - Even though my windows is English version and language is set to read both English and another language.This is a Big Bug and it very frustrating to users. It's hard to find such information on Mcafee website, and after 30minutes' searching at mcafee, I found a link tohttp://www.mcafeehelp.com. They post a solution to the problem but I found that it does not always solve your problem smoothly. I had to try several times and restart my windows several times to have it finally solved.I was wondering why Mcafee release such a buggy software."
2,Firewall problems,"The software seemed to install itself smoothly, but once I started it up I realized that the firewall wasn't working. I tried reinstalling, but had no luck. I contacted tech support, and never heard back. So, I gave up."
1,What a Nightmare,"I'm pretty computer savy, but this program has stumped me at every turn. I've been trying for two weeks to load it properly, but it never does. The firewall program shut off my cable internet access (I'm not kidding, blocked every port out of the computer) for two days before I realized it was the culprit and uninstalled it. Tech Support has proven they don't care at all - I have now contacted them five time about five different issues and not one of them has been resolved. I hate to say it, but I would stay as far away from the program as possible. I haven't tried Norton, but it couldn't be worse."
1,Not a good product,"I would have returned this key finder had I not misplaced the original packaging (which is required for a return). The light has a pretty strong beam, but that's about the only good thing. Clapping right next to it doesn't make the sound go off, but picking it up or moving it in the slightest way does. The plastic clip is so lightweight and flimsy that I don't want to attach it to my keychain for fear that it will break. I wanted a key finder- I got a mini flashlight."
1,A complete waste of time and money,Following the instructions was a complete and utter waste of time it never beeped when you clapped only after fifteen to twenty minuites later after a while(several weeks) I got fed-up and returned it.
4,Yamaha Yfm350 Atv Hayne's Automotive Repair Manual,"Yamaha Yfm350 Atv Hayne's Automotive Repair Manual was in fair condition. a few pages was loose, but readable, and stuffed in the book loosely. took some time to arrive. was worth the price."
1,Scammed again!!,"I went looking for framed copies of Keith Haring's prints, because I am furnishing a house for a friend who LOVES Keith Haring's work. I found this framed print on Amazon.com Used for around $50 plus shipping. I was excited, to say the least. The item looked legit and I bought it right away. A few hours later, I got an email notice from the Seller, saying the deal was cancelled because the item was out of stock. How can the item be out of stock if it is one-of-a-kind and used, to boot. Now I know why the sale was cancelled. I just looked up the same print on Amazon.com and the price NOW for this print framed is $149.xx!! I guess the Seller just didn't want to ""take a bath"" for his posting mistake! I think the Seller should be made to honor the original sale! I think I got taken advantage of.My opinion? If the Seller is this unscrupulous about a mistake he/she made, how honest and trustworthy will this Seller be for other sales? For my money, find a different place to buy this print!"
5,Great for any Spears fan,"This video is a must have for all Britney Spears fans. The video contains all three videos(Crazy, Sometimes, and BOMT) and behinds the scenes interviews and making of the videos segments. A nice addition is the Disney concert which has other songs such as ""I Will Be There"" and ""Born to Make You Happy"" Overall a great addition to any fans library!"
4,Britney Spears Fans(Including me)-This is the video for you!,"If you are a fan of Britney Spears, you really need to see this video. It includes stories about her life, recording her first album (...Baby one more time) and behind the scenes of her video ""...Baby one more time"" and also the video, and also for the videos ""Sometimes"" and ""(You Drive Me) Crazy"". They also include what she thinks it's like being on the road, and on tour."
1,Britney is terrible,"This is more proof that Britney is a joke, she'll be out of a career in maybe...a year or two. Once the little boys and girls who love her grow up and realize that there is real music out there, they'll desert her. I thought the DVD prooves that she is terrible. Anyone thinking of buying this DVD, DON'T. All the 5 star reviews are from little kids who would give Britney 5 stars if it was great or bad, and bad in this case. Don't buy this DVD."
1,What's worse than Britney music?,"The actual Britney! This video is horrible, and it really shows how talentless she truly is. She is an awful person with a fake persona who I'd never like to meet. Genie Gets Her Wish by Christina Aguilera is so much better than this worthless piece of hooha."
5,outstanding,"This is one of the best DVDS, which has been produced ever on this earth, with a very beautiful and captivating Britney Spears, one of the best singer and dancer. The DVD show a great photo album, producing of Videos, very nice tunes, many different interviews, and to you who have reached the age, or any other cases wants, but not manage to raise the prick. To that, I have no better advice to give, than to watch this DVD, and I quite sure that it will take direction against the Heaven very quickly.Written by a hobby doctor."
5,I love this video!,If you are a fan of Britney Spears you should get this video! It has all her music videos except From the Bottom of My Broken Heart. The interviews are good and they show her on the Disney concert.
1,Extremely poor audio quality for the price,"This is an extremely poor audio quality headset. For this price, you should check out the Nokia BH-900 instead. :Do not buy this Belkin headset. I received it as a gift and was really not pleased with it. The range is poor and the headset produces a lot of static."
3,Inexpensive way to stay legal,"I bought these to make my golf cart ""legal"" on local roads. Used a 1"" x 1"" angle iron across the roof pillars, then fastened the belts to the angle iron..............worked great."
4,Very good,I liked the item. The purchase and transaction whent smoothly. Would like to make a purchase with this seller again
1,not what I expected,"I was looking for clip-art to decorate my web pages. What I found were photos (jpg) and drawings (wmf). Typically, when I use photos on my website, I use my own. As for the wmf drawings, they aren't even in a format which can be used on the web (and no tool is supplied to convert them).There is also an included CD which supposedly has thousands of web images (gif). However, they turn out to be little more than a few very simple images, turned in various directions, colored in various colors, and given various affects (e.g. blinking). I found this CD to be literally worthless.I was very disappointed with this collection."
1,Excelent Clipart but...,"You only can use the images for home entertainment, personal, and educational purposes.If you are a professional this package stinks, mainly because many and many of the images are stolen from public domain material, and YOU CANOT USE THEM?!!! This new order copyright olders are amazing, some even say ""our artistic creations"" about last century paintings, ridiculous... this package is one of them."
3,Have seen better,"I installed this software for clipart to add to my menus. It was relatively easy to install. However the selection wasn't excellent, and I haven't been able to find any of the ""thousands of fonts"". It's not a bad buy if your kids are using this for school projects (and even then I am sure there are better packages on the market). I think I would go with a different compnay next time."
4,Good Book!,"I have really enjoyed these books, so neat to see the things that ""the borrowers"" use on the things we toss. Nice to read a nice clean book..."
4,Fun light reading.,This was fun to read. It lifted your spirits and you couldn't waite to turn the page to learn more. It brought out the child in me.
1,No Radio wpould have been better than these radios,"Never worked from the day I removed them from the packaging and charged them. Then when I needed a tow and tried to use them to contact another Boater, they didn't work, finally when I flagged another boat down and they agreed to tow us to the Marina, my son was on the boat towing us, less that 50 feet away, and we couldn't even talk to one another. Never used them again, and will never by a product from the again.Disgusted in PA"
2,non intuitive UI,"So, hey, the fleet is communicating on channel 80 today. Uh. How do you get to channel 80? Why should I have to get the manual out just to get to channel 80? Where's the squelch? How on earth does this thing work? This is an incredibly poorly designed device."
2,Midland hand-held marine radio,"It worked great from the marina to another part of the marina but could not contact a boat less than two miles away in 5 knot winds and beyond a break wall.The merchandise arrived in a couple days, well packaged and Amazon was very accomodating."
4,"It's ok, but just ok","For the price it does a decent job. Not as much range as my old Humminbird handheld and it isn't as loud. Complicated series of button pushes to go dual channel are still causing me problems, but I'll get used to it. The dry bag is nice and you can still use the buttons unlike others I have had. All the rest of the crap you get with it is alright, but I'll never wear a microphone/earphone headpiece while sailing. Rechargeables don't seem to last as long as throw-aways but the DC adaptor solves that problem. Overall it is a good, but basic, radio. If it lasts for 3 years of use it will have been worth the money."
1,"Terrible reception, spend your money elsewhere",This NTVP1 radio may be inexpensive and OK if you are chatting with someone nearby -- and I'm talking about NEARBY -- but I found the reception to be incredibly poor. Vessels within a mile radius would not tune in. It looks like a deal at $45 but you'd be much better off spending more money for a superior product like a Uniden.
1,false advertising of prices,When we placed our order for the marine midland nautico handheld radios the price on the screen stated that the item price was 49.99 how ever we were billed 59.99 apiece for them. When we called the seller about this price change he informed us that it must be an error that amazon .com made and said they could not refund the difference. If it is on the screen being advertised at one price I would say its pretty convenient to then change the price and tell the customer you cant do anything about it. Over all we are not impressed with the way this was handled and although we had planned to order several more we will now order from a different site. We will also be advising a number of our friends who planned to buy them here not to do so!
4,Great price for VHF,"Menu not very intuitive, but works great for the price. Best price I could find with dual power.Update. I have had this VHF for several years, with only moderate use. Not highly recommended. I have had sudden battery failures, with the low battery warning level giving no indication (from full charge, to dead). Recharging resolves, but frustrating when you are using radio just before second race start. When I first received the radio, I tested it with 30 second dunk in sink water, which worked. Last weekend, spent about 15 minutes in local bay area water. Deepest the VHF had gone, was 2' to 3'. The radio was in the provided ""water proof"" case (not an after market). The VHF water proofing failed miserably. Inside of radio was saturated."
4,Good value in a VHF Marine Radio,"Good product although not waterproof as the ad alluded to. They provide a plastic sleeve which makes it ""waterproof"". Good, crisp audio quality with decent range. For the price, it is a good buy."
2,Did not work first time,I received the unit on time but after one day the volume did not work anymore have to return the unit for replacement.
1,Terrible Radio,Bought 2. One broke after 15 minutes. The other doesn't contact my neighbor 100 feet away. Waste of lots of money. Midland let me down.Motorola next.
4,Works as advertised,Good value for what you get. Works fine. Lots of accessories included that usually add a lot more in cost.
3,Compliance,"When I was searching for a product to be in compliance with the Coast Guard Regulations, I decided on your product because of it and the price was right.Mahalo"
1,Radio is not legal outside the US,Please be aware that this radio is illegal outside of the US (Source: Midland Radio Consumer Accounts Specialist). I had to return it as I needed to use it in Britain. Why anyone would market a marine radio with International channels that is not usable globally is beyond me.
4,VHF Hand held Radio,"I purchased a set of VHF radios to use with my AgEd classes and Ski race team. I felt the 5 watts was a great power buy, especially since I was able to purchase two radios for the price of one Uniden 6 watt hand held. They work great and are clear as a bell. I especially like the opportunity to check the NOAA weather to see what is coming during training.I would recommend the purchase to anyone. I have also used them on my boat and have fantastic transmission and reception across many differing water platforms."
3,Great but needs better manual,I am using this product and it seems to work well but the manual is poorly written and I am sure I could get alot more out of it if I could understand the skimpy info in the manual
5,Great Deal!,"This was a great deal on a full 5 watt handheld VHF radio. Doesn't look so rugged, but for my use, it's great. Came with all the accessories to use in any situation. Only problem is that every once in a while, the channel gets stuck on 16 and I have to reset the radio. Unfortunately, it happens so rarely I can't usually remember the reset process. Again, the best price on a handheld you'll find."
1,Poor Item,"The only reason I even gave it one star was that it did turn on. The battery lasts about 1 hour fully charged, which is just sad. I could not communicate with a vessel that was 1 mile from me, which again is sad. Spend a little more money and get a better product."
2,not happy with this at all,Pray your life doesn't depend on you transmitting consistently or changing channels quickly on this unit. I'm not a idiot when it comes to electronics - this one has me very frustrated. Finding your way from 16/9 to a Wx channel is not a single step. Changing back to a working channel from a Wx channel is not as simple you would hope either. A fellow boater purshased on of these than hurled it to the bottom of the lake in frustration. Mine may be close behind. The PTT (transmit) button seems to be touchy - it would not transmit consistently. I programmed a Cobra handheld for a friend of mine (because he is a self-admitted electronics idiot) and found that unit much more user friendly and it appears to be a little more rugged than this unit.
4,gift book,great book. very enjoyable read. would like to read more by this author.\will look for other authors that write in similar fashion.
1,Just horrible.,"I had to get this book for my college course and normally I keep the photoshop books that I buy, but this one I want to sell ASAP! I really thought this book was a joke. Yes, it does tell you how to do things in photoshop, but the work you create is horrible.I love art don't get me wrong, but when you take a picture of trees with snow, put a black square in the middle, then draw out a sketchy circle over it and call it art... That's where I have a problem."
1,Not the Best Photoshop Book,"This book is boring and serves as a way for the author to showcase his artsy-fartsy photoshopped images. I don't find them beautiful at all as other reviewers have mentioned. They are quite ugly to be frank. The how-to part is treacherously, butchered and sandwiched between his horrendous ""ah-mmm"", ""spiritual"" reflections/bs on his image and the how-to on creating this image. Huh? Why would I want to create something that he already done myself? This book is awful."
5,Easy to use......,"....and works great but just be careful it doesn't scratch your bike. Depending on the bike, you might need to install this in reverse (clevis pin under the saddle) to avoid scratching your bike."
4,Good Product. Good Price,"This is a great product. Does the job for odd frame sizes. Just be sure to check distance from seat to front stem. The distance needs to be at least 17"" to hold best."
2,Can damage bikes,"Purchased this for my mountain bike. After transporting it I noticed that where it clips and is held on by tension on to the front of the bike below the handle bars had rattled/vibrated due to the road conditions and had ripped the seal of my bike.IT WILL TRANSPORT YOUR BIKE, BUT NO GUARANTEE ON THE BIKES CONDITION."
2,EH,"it gets the job done, but it isn't pretty. It doesn't secure very will and it makes me nervous. The few times I have used it, however, the bike stayed in place. I'll probably look for a different option."
2,"works, but scratch bike and pinch hand","Pros:- cheap- works on my mountain bikeCons:- just bought it in July 2010, product is different from the picture, the bar side still uses metal clip- the metal pin and coarse wire scratch the stem- need to be careful when removing the bar, your will be pinched if you leave your hands at the joint between inner and outer tubesIt is still the cheapest solution on Amazon."
4,Works great,"The bike store tried to sell me a Saris brand bar for $35. This one works just as well at less than half the cost! It works great on my 24"" women's bicycle to have it fit on the rack. I use it 5 times a week on a 40 mile roundtrip on highways and it holds up great. My only gripes are what other people have said; the bar you receive is not the bar Amazon pictures (it is the one that someone posted in customer images). The end pin is metal and it will scratch your bike, so I would not recommend it for use on an expensive bike (I don't mind much since I just have a cheap bike for intercampus travel, so it's not a big deal). Additionally, I pinch my fingers almost every single time I am installing it on my bike, so you have to be really careful. Still, it's an excellent product and works great with my Thule rack."
1,Unreliable pin retention mechanism,"After opening and closing the pin retention bracket a couple of times, pin was no longer retained well - I could push it out with one finger. Returned the adaptor due to worries of it coming apart during transportation."
2,good cheap solution ends with scratch bike....,After only one use the bar just scratch my brand new specialized epic $$$$! The hook is protected with rubber whereas the end with the pin is NOT so be careful with this it will scratch your bike! Now i just use a sock to prevent tear and wear on my bike... other than that it does do job.
5,Excellent for any full suspension,Perfect for hanging and model full suspension bike on any of the two arm carriers. I have a $4500 bike and have no qualms about relying on the Allen Tension Bar being fully dependable. Is is a 29er and it has room to spare. I had to open up the hook on the seatpost side a little for easier use.
1,Metal on metal,"Unlike other adaptor bars the front (the side with the pin) isn't covered in any sort of plastic/rubber, so it is metal on metal (paint). There is no way this wouldn't scratch/chip the finish on a bike, I now have a chip in my paint. Adaptors are inexpensive to begin with so I returned the Allen brand and got one with rubber on both ends (different brand)."
2,OK product with major flaws,"Had this product for a year and a half. Fits daughter's 18"" bicycle, but doesn't help hanging it on my Yakima rack. Working with the bike, I find the bike is too short to fit the arms. Additionally, it would be nice to secure the bar and the bicycle. I think rope could do a more effective job to secure the bike. Needs more thought to create a good product. Save your money."
3,Scratches,"I bought this cross bar for my hybrid bike. I paid a lot for that bike. I have a SARIS bike carrier and wanted to get the Saris cross bar, but it was more expensive. I wish I had went ahead and paid the extra 20$ because this cross bar will scratch your paint, and it did many times. Okay for someone who is a casual rider and is using older bikes. If you are riding an expensive bike, go with the thule or saris-or you will end up sick about a large dollar bike, new, being scratched!"
1,pin configuration not secure,"I don't have this product but I have the Allen Premium-5-Bike-Hitch-Mount-Rack. They both have the same pin configuration (from what I've seen on the installation video). The pin configuration is NOT FULLY SECURE...and the clip could eventually slip off due to vibration or side-to-side movement. The design is flawed.On the bike rack, the pin configuration is just a ""backup"" to another fully secure ""primary"" pin. But on the adapter it serves as the ""primary"" pin. I was thinking of buying this adapter to go with my bike rack but will not buy it due to the high risk pin configuration."
4,tension bar-RV Bike carrier,"I have been carrying our two bikes-1m-1f for years with real troublr for my wifes bike-NO Bar to balance with a decent attachment level line or secure.I just bought two e-bikes, electric without knowing they would weigh 65 lbs,w/o the bttrys on, and over 75 almost eighty with. These two bars attached to both bikes no problem and held very well on the back of a 30 ft travel trailer(very rough) ride.The wired bar attachement on one end can be bent and i would suggest an extra pin or wrap as back up otherwise this solved a real issue and very heavy problem very well. If you carry bikes on a two bar style carrier theses will pay for themselves day one first load.bmw"
5,cross-bar from amazon.com,"This worked out great, we purchased 2 to add to our bikes so we can put the bikes on our new bike carrier."
5,Effective Neat tool,I didnt realize that there was an adapter for tricky bikes but I went camping with two bikes and used this on one of them and it worked great and was very easy to use!!
2,Find another one if you care about scratches,"This thing scratches the hell out of my stem. Not that it's a HUGE deal, but it is also a pain in the butt for me to remove, because I have to brace myself against the seat to remove the thing from the post, since the ""hook"" end doesn't seem to be the correct size for a standard seat post- it is ever so slightly smaller, and thus, gives you a really good grip on the bike, but makes it hard to remove. Additionally, any of the plastic coating on it is falling apart after a few months of use. This thing is really just a cheap piece of junk. If you care at all about your bike being scratched, or need something that is easy to remove without scratching your bike, then look elsewhere. That said, it does work for carrying the oddly shaped mt. bike on my bike rack, and for that I give it 2 stars."
4,Does the Job,"There's not much that could go wrong with using this and it does the job it is suppose to. The pin and ""U"" connector really should have some insulation to avoid scratching the bike stem, so I've been using electrical tape until I can come up with something better. I'm sure I've seen other adapters with more padding and I'd probably go that way if I were to do it over again. But this is not a hill to die on for me."
4,I really like Allen Bike Rack's,I needed this accesory to put my daughter's bike on the only bike rack that I could find that fits on my Toyota Prius. I liked how it worked so much that I bought a second one for my wife's Bike.
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with the Allen Tension Bar. I purchased this product about a year ago. The rubber covering is peeling off, the end with the pin scratches the heck out of my bike. I'm shopping for a new bar adaptor."
3,Hook side a little tight on the seat post,"I got this for my wife's bike, and there are some pros and cons...ProsNice tight fitWell made, solidConsThe hook side is a bit narrow making it difficult to get on/off the seat postThe retaining pin will scratch your bikes stemSince the hook side is so difficult, I end up taking it off from the front, retaining pin side, which is tricky since you are pulling on the inner tube, can get a nasty pinch. I fixed the retaining pin problem of scratching by cutting some tygon tubing, made a slit in it, and fit it on the pin, works like a charm. I may try to bend the hook a little wider, to see if that helps..."
5,A must have,"I just bought an Allen 5 bike hitch carrier. I didn't want to, but read and ordered 4 of these units. They look very well built. Work fine and were needed. In the case of 2 24 inch bikes ( for my smallest children), I had to raise the bike seat to get the proper angle. It's not he tension bar problem, but the bikes are too small. I made a very good choice with them. I recommend them."
4,Very well thought out,Allen Tension Bar Bicycle Cross-Bar AdaptorCertainly a well built device. Solved the problem of hanging a (Ladies) bike on the car and garage storage rack. Don't have to wrestle with this problem anymore. All bikes hang normal.GREAT IDEA!
4,Tension Bar,"I bought 2 of these, for my girls bikes. They are a bit bulky on the one end, and dont fit great with reflectors on. It has a nice spring action and feels secure, but be careful on the type of bike, depending on the frame (especially kids bikes) it may not fit as well as it should."
4,works fine,I have three of these I use on bikes on the back of my camper for long trips. we have never had a problem with them. they are easy to use. I would recommend them.
5,Does the Job!,"I got this so I could transport my commuter bike (a Trek WSD 7100) to another city. It works just like it says and fit my bike well, I wasn't worried at all about the bike coming off the rack. Just be sure to attach the part to the front of your bike first, and remove the part on the stem first when you go to take it off."
1,"Garbage, don't waste your money...","Very cheap locking mechanism for the pin, spring clip would not lock onto pin groove allowing the spring clip and pin to come loose, didn't want to chance loosing my bike on the highway so I had to run to my local bike shop and bought a Saris bar, I highly recommend the Saris version, you don't want to chance your bikes flying off the back of your vehicle."
4,Cross Bar Adaptor,"Very handy item for multiple bikes on a rack. Keeps from having one bike tilted at an awkward position from the other(s). Very easy to use, just be careful as the spring tension can fool you and you can get a finger pinched. It only took one pinch and now I can set the bikes up like a pro."
5,Allen Tension Bar Bicycle Cross-Bar Adaptor,This adaptor is easy to use and worked well to keep the bike level. It also is made well because we were rear-ended with our bikes on the back of our car. The bikes were all bent up but the bar was perfectly OK. We saved the bar and had to trash the bikes.
5,Great adaptor bar,"We bought this bar for my bike, but ended up using it on my son's bike. We were able to put my bike on the rack just fine, but my son has a Trek bike that wouldn't fit on the rack very well until we used this bar. The bar is very easy to attach to the bike and take off when done."
2,Kinda a pain to use,The concept is a great idea but unfortunately it doesn't quite work the way it's supposed to on any of our bikes. There's one bike it will actually fit on and that one doesn't really need it because it mounts on the rack just fine. This will work on one other bike of ours but you have to get creative on how to put it on. The main thing I don't like about this adapter bar is that it snaps back if you aren't paying attention and pinches the heck out of your hand!!! I had a purple welt for days!! It definitely is easier to put on if you have two people. I decided it was too much hassle to mess with though so I don't even use it anymore.
2,Junk. I don't see how this wouldn't scratch the bike to no end.,"I sent it back. Just like the other reviews stated. The product I received had bare metal on one end that would annihilate the paint on the brand new bike we spent many hundreds of dollars on. I could have made it work by cutting some garden hose and using some tape, but the manufacturer could make it work by designing it right too, so there you have it."
2,Great idea but,"I bought this so I could use the adapter to carry my wifes bike on our new Allen rack. MY complaint is the finish work on it. Upon grabbing it from the packaging, there was a very sharp burr on a rivet that sliced my finger wide open. I contacted Amazon and was told someone would contact me, that was a week ago, no contact. It is something that be fixed with a file but I got blood all over my suit as I was heading to work"
3,Not very useful for a mixte frame,"Two things:1. for a mixte bike the difference is too trivial to make its use worthwhile.2. even installed as directed it is loose and likely to damage the bike or even come off during transport. At least on the bike in question. YMMV.For a true ""ladies"" bike it might prove invaluable. It is also very well-made and easy to use.I returned it."
2,Dissapointed,"I purchased this item after buying the last one my local store had left on hand. I was pretty excited because it looked like an identical product for half the price...However, the lock mechanism broke after only 2 uses, so the pin slides out while my bike is on the wrack, it truly is a disaster waiting to happen and I am glad that I saw this before we took off down the highway with our bikes on the back. I have since rigged it up with a different type of locking device, but I was truly dissapointed at the quality."
4,Works like the video instructs,Simple to use and came amazingly fast for me. It is a bit heavier then I would like but the construction is solid. I am also not a big fan of the metal coil securing the locking mechanism. With those gripes still a 4 star product.
2,not what I thought it was.,"Description need to be better. This wasn't what i thought it was, and nowit's too late to return. Be Careful."
3,Works as described,Would have been nice to know that another purchase was necessary to be able to use the bike rack I bought
5,Heavy duty.,Strong and well made. Easy to use. Does what it is supposed to do. Works well on my wifes bike.
3,Bike Bar,I was unable to transport bike on ladder rack on RV wihtout this.It works great and solves the problem.
5,Good item!,"Works exactly as advertised; quick and easy to use, enables bike to be transported securely on my Thule spare tire mount rack. Very solid construction."
5,A must have!,This is a must have if you have a women's bike and plan to take it anywhere on a trunk mount bike rack. Simple to use and does exactly what it's supposed to do.
5,Made transporting a woman's bike much easier !,Bought a 2 bike Allen bike rack for my car. Noticed that the placement of a female bike on it was lopsided. Noticed that Allen created this bar to allow one to place a female bike on the rack the same way a male bike goes on. This purchase was cheap and just saves time and effort when loading bikes onto rack. Thanks Allen !
3,Revealing expose of exotic dancing,"STRIPPED is a mildly interesting documentary in which film maker Jill Morley profiles several women from different backgrounds who are strippers, and the circumstances in their lives that led them to this line of work. Morley herself decides to try dancing. When she goes in to try out as a dancer the guy who does the auditions has ""sleazeball"" written all over him. She soon experiences first hand how pathetic some men can be around topless dancers. (Sure, I've made my share of comments about breasts and buttocks in some of my reviews but I'm not about to treat ANYBODY like that. Believe it or not, The Vidiot is actually quite a nice guy). The women's eventual paths are not all rose tinted either, one dies during cosmetic surgery while another mysteriously disappears; reportedly murdered by a cult. Sobering stuff. While STRIPPED is not up to the standards of some other documentaries in the same vein, it is still worth a look."
3,scattered convertions,"I bought the book with the idea of entering those great minds and their struggles with conversion amid opposition and rejecttion. But Pearce's books is a mountain of scattered information about these monumental figures. I struggled to finish it each time I took to reading it since, I would get lost with the too abundant disgresions/distractions from the person he is dealing with at the time. I do find the book a great piece of research, not of literature (so disordered! ) and came out with a feeling of being shorthanded in the issue of their motives. It's a GOOD portrait of the times when they were alive and changing our society. All in all I do not recomend it for gaining insight in the lives of these writers, but good for a glimpse at their times and the cultural environmet. Sorry."
4,This one keeps you guessing to the end.,"This is the most recent installment on the life and times of the Iris House Bed and Breakfast and its owner, Tess Darcy. Once more, Tess has fallen head first into a murder, the death of Edwina Riley, an elderly quilter and possibly the most hated woman in town. Discovery of Edwina's secrets and how she collected the secrets of the town adds interest to many of the characters. The characters were well written and drew me in emotionally...I actually grieved over one of their deaths! The true killer never even entered my mind as a possibility until almost the end. Tight and quick action in this story, though I was disappointed that Edwina's house and history weren't more explored. In particular, her old and crumbing mansion and her own past, which is always looming over the story, but never really seen. Nevertheless, a very enjoyable read, hard to put down."
3,interesting,"I read this book when it first came out and found it very interesting. But it seemed to fall off the radar screen. Now, 30 years later, I believe it was truly before it's time. Unlike other reviewers, I find that there is nothing contradictory between many of the observations and predictions that the author made 30 years and much of the concerns of the global environmental community regarding global climate change. Serious scientists who have been concerned about climate change for several decades have never claimed to know the full reprecussions of this climate change. And more and more are using the phrase, ""global climate change"" rather than ""global warming"" for exactly this reason. And there is, indeed, increasing concern that we could very well be heading into another ice age as a direct result of increased carbon emissions.Mr. Ponte was indeed prescient!"
5,All around performer,"I bought this DVD player at Ultimate Electronics for fairly cheap. Considering that this is a Denon we are talking about, you get a lot for the price.I bought this unit for it's DVD-R reading capabilities, and for the most part, it has surpassed my already high expectations. DVD-R playback is for the most part well done, as is the MP3 playback with it's easy to use interface.The unit looks nice too, silver face with the neat green light around the on/off button is a nice touch. The fit and finish is to be expected with such a low-end product (Well, the lowest in Denon's line anyway). The disc tray does not line up well with the face, but as I said before, for the price, you really get a lot, but it's still Denon's low end.I would reccomend this item to anyone who's looking for a cheap player that does most, who also want to name drop a reveered brand."
4,"Very good, but it is just the beginning","The one major problem with this series is that it is mostly a set-up for the other series. It stands very well alone, but the reader (at least this one) fill like it just begone. So if you by this one also by Sailor on the Seas of Fate."
5,Still the best,"Like Tolkien, Moorcock's work has been looted by almost every fantasy writer who has come after him. But the original remains as vital as ever. This is a great start to a series in which the books get better and better -- until you hit the stunning final volume (Stormbringer). And even the new books -- Revenge of the Rose, The Dreamthief's Daughter -- contain a vitality, an attackwhich leaves most of Moorcock's competitors a long way behind.He is a Master of Fantasy, a world-class novelist, and this short novel is richer, fuller and more satisfying than any number of books four times its length. A great read. I'd forgotten how good they were!"
3,"Great Story, Horrible Storytelling","I just finished reading The Elric Saga and I have to say that the story itself is superb. Elric, last sorceror-king of the ancient race of Melniboneans, with his evil, soul-stealing sword, Stormbringer, ventures out amidst the human kingdoms to fulfill his destiny as the Champion Eternal. I absolutely loved the storyline. Unfortunately I hated the way Mr Moorcock told the story. None of the interesting details that would normally flesh-out a great story like this were provided. On numerous occasions Elric is challenged with an exciting, complex and extremely difficult quest but 4 or 5 pages later that quest is completed. All the reader gets in the way of detail is, ""Elric does this..."", ""Elric does that..."", ""Elric is depressed"", ""Elric is angry"" and finally, ""Elric kills that..."". With that said, the story itself was strong enough to pull me through the overly-simplistic storytelling and compel me to read the rest of the series."
4,Holds up well after all these years.,"Elric is the 428th emperor of the fading empire of Melnibone. Seemingly the inheritor of the weakness that affects his empire, Elric is an albino who needs to be kept alive with drugs and magic. Even though he believes that the effort is futile, he still tries to save Melnibone from the ravages of the Young Kingdoms.Beautifully written, Moorcock is a master of the genre.(Note that the entire Elric saga gets five stars-- I'm giving it 4 simply because I'm spoiled by the long novels of today's standard and this little book will feel like simply the setup portion of a longer novel to current readers. For people who haven't read Elric before, I'd recommend buying several to read at once, or if you can find it then I'd buy the editions which bind several volumes into one book.)"
4,The core book of dark fantasy,"Elric of Melnibone is a faerie tale gone wild.This is a story about traditions and intrigue, of high sorcery and treachery, protagonized by the moody emperor of an (very) ancient, decaying empire. Elric is an anti-hero, and the whole culture surrounding him has demented traditions for cornerstones.Moorcock points Shakespeare as one of his influences: he certainly got the royal intrigue mood from the Bard (great dialogue, too!); the chapter openings he borrowed from Brecht (another confessed influence), which help adding a mythical atmosphere to the whole tale. An atmosphere that's enhanced by the exagerations of time (an empire that lasts thousands of years) and places (towers made of gemstones, the sea labyrinth, etc...). And, of course, sorcery."
2,"Pulp era fiction, for better *and* worse","Having recently discovered the sub-genre of Sword and Sorcery, I was really excited about this book. Unfortunately, while the stories do have their particular strengths, enough of the worst aspects of the Pulp era of genre fiction were present to degrade the experience overall.I got the impression that these tales were rushed. Another reviewer mentioned that he got the impression that these stories were made up as the author went along. I have to agree.The overall quality of the writing is rather low, unfortunately.There *were* some very interesting ideas here, but the execution was poor; this book is guilty of most of the stereotyped writing crimes that the Pulp era writers have been accused of by various critics."
3,Disappointed,"While it was interesting enough to hold my attention, I was disappointed in this book [and indeed, in the whole series]. I find Moorcock's style to be overly vague. He skims over incidents which, in my mind, deserve further exploration [either in terms of the action itself, or the reasons for the incidents] with genre ""cheats"". Too often I read about Elric ""just knowing"" that it was ""the only way"" to accomplish a task. Those kinds of literary shortcuts [all too well known in fantasy and sci-fi genres] annoy me greatly, and the entire Elric series is filled with them, often to the point of leading to inconsistencies in Elric's character, or incongruities of plot [how, for example, does the Ship Which Sails Over Land And Sea make in back to Melniborne when it was landlocked in a faraway land, it's power to sail over land taken from it?].An interesting read, but I fail to see how it achieved such canonical status."
4,An amazing first half,"This is an amazing story - up to a point. I was enthralled for the first half, but after that it simply fell apart. Moorcock leads you on for page after page with hypnotic, poetic writing...and then let's you fall. It had so much promise up to that point (Elric is an amazing character, and Moorcock's world seems incredibly real) but then seemed to lose it's way. Still, it is a great effort, and were it possible, I would give it 4.5. It *almost* reaches greatness."
5,A great fantasy book,"The book seemed to start of slow, but it really picked up and turned out to be a great story. It was well worth my time and money. I really reccomend you read this book if you are looking for a good time. I was disappointed at the short length of 181 pages though."
5,"A sharp-angled, unique classic.","Michael Moorcock remarked in the introduction to ""Tales of the White Wolf"" that he had little love for Tolkien. Indeed, the Elric saga can be taken as a complete opposite of the way ""Lord of the Rings"" is written, except in one aspect: the writing is just as good. The style is, however, very different. Where Tolkien would have supplied lush detail, Moorcock's stripped imagery contributes to the harshness of Elric's world. Anything more (or less) would detract from the story.--S.L-S."
5,The Greatest Fantasy Novel of the 20th Century,"I cannot recommend this book highly enough to any writer or reader seeking the consumate fantasy hero novel. Its construction and wording are exquisite, and it follows all of the classic elements Robert Campbell mentions in ""The Warrior's Journey."" Elric is such a rich, fascinating character that it is impossible not to identify with his struggles. The war between Chaos and Law is our own internal struggle, the warring conscience of Mankind, ever at odds, striving for balance, yet rarely acheiving it. Like Elric, we find only small solace, even in Tanelorn, for struggle is what drives us--the fire in the brain, the quest for the unattainable. We are all Warriors At The Edge of Time, and Moorcock uses his magnificent style to convey this ongoing war we call ""life"" with elegent prose that truly makes ""Elric of Melnibone"" one of the pivotal fantasy novels of our century. A must read! A perfect 10!"
2,Pour for More - Receiving God's Grace,"This book was wonderful. Jackie Beavers is a single mom who overcame tremendous obstacles in her life and went from poverty to riches (financially), from emotional bankruptcy to spiritual fulfillment, from a disconnect with family members, to healing and restoration of relationships that seemed ""unfixable."" It is rivetting to see how she began and prospered a business venture into millions, as well as how her emotional well-being went from zero to ""millions."" The ""God-connection"" in all these areas of her life is remarkable, inspirational and encouraging to ALL. This book is a MUST READ for everyone!"
2,Not what I expected,"Thought the book would be more about the people & their life in the Big Thicket; such as, hiding there to stay out of military draft.."
5,This is and always will be the best TRU cd ever out,"This cd was made back in the day when no limit was still in california where they should have stayed because the best music comes from the west. None of these songs dont have that heavy bassy feeling to them, except maybe 3 strikes. All these songs sound as if they were recorded in 91 or 92 because they each have a pretty tight old skool beat"
4,Great Show,"Eps 7,8,11,127. A Pegesus Page Turner8. A Teacher's Leason11. Driven Dreamer12. Cutting it Close"
5,Love this season !,Only I have it on dvd! Because my dvd is a hybrid! So I have the best of both worlds. But I've loved this version of Sailor Moon and always will!
5,Good quality oils,I bought these oils because my husband loves a back rub and these were just what we needed. Lotion tends to dry out and get sticky. These oils are smooth and do not leave the skin sticky. I like 4 out of 5 of the scents.
4,Not all smell nice,"Having never bought any massage oil before, I tried this pack to see what I liked. Not all smelled good. Tossed two of the five because I thought they stunk! This might be different for someone else though. The oil it's self was light and easy to work with."
4,"Wonderful sample, feel silky",Love the variety that each has to offer. They are silky and don't leave your skin feeling oily. A great starting sample pack for massages.
4,Awesome! Worth the buy!,"Arrived REALLY quickly,Neatly packaged and brand new. Only 4 stars due to the oil is SLIGHTLY watery. Nothing that effects the quality of the product but still awesome!"
3,WARNING: Not for beginners!,"This is really good for people who already know some French, or had experience in learning it before. But this is definetely NOT for beginners. This book and cassettes were a great help to me, 'coz I've I learnt some French before, but it didn't much help my friend, who was a beginner. The cassettes were excellent though. I agree, because I think it goes through lessons quite fast. I recommend this to people who know some French, but not to beginners."
2,disappointing,The foam insert inside of the case was terrible to fit to my camera which barely fit in the case to start off with. I dont feel that this product was worth the money that I payed for it.
3,Product Details are not correct.,"This is a nice box BUT not the same dimensions reported on the product details. You haveProduct DetailsProduct Dimensions: 10.6 x 4.9 x 9.7 inches ; 4 pounds.The dimension for the 1120 case are: interior dimension 7.25""x4.75""x3.06"" & the exterior dimension 8.12"" x 6.56"" x 3.56"" so i will have to find some thing else to use this for. I notice that when I change the product type that the dimension don't change, so you may want to check www.pelican for more info. on the type you are looking for."
5,Great case for GoPro cameras,"Bought this case to keep my GoPro camera safe. Works great, easy to customize the foam, super durable. Really like that it is waterproof and airtight as well."
5,1000ward,"Este reproductor de mp3 es muy bueno si lo que te interesa es tener memoria disponible y ejercitarte. El precio es bastante accesible y definitivamente es mas fuerte que el Ipod shuffle.Milward (Panama, Central America)"
3,Not the three complete recordings,"Although the music is fabulous, as expected, I was disappointed to discover that this CD does not include all songs from the original recordings. Since I was purchasing the CD to replace a 20-year-old cassette, this incompleteness is a great disappointment."
4,A fine book.,"This is an extremely interesting view of the mindset of the Kamikaze. Not for everyone perhaps but well worth it for those interested in World War II, aviation or the Japanese."
2,eh,"The aesthetic appeal of the unit is superb, and it is quite comfortable. However, as with many steering wheel covers, this one tends to slide out of place, leaving the grips unevenly placed over the steering wheel. I solved the problem by putting 2 small pieces of velcro on both sides of the steering wheel."
4,Helped my hurting hands.,"I drive a lot for my job. In fact, in the last 5 months I have put over 6,000 miles on my car. Yeah. So my hands tend to cramp up. I bought this to try and remedy that situation. It HAS helped very much! My hands no longer cramp up while driving, which is probably very unsafe if you think about it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is #1. Because it was hard to figure out where to put the little cushion things. Make sure to figure out where you want them before putting the cover on, because it is very hard to get off. #2. Because it said it would keep the steering wheel from getting hot/cold. So far the cover has not protected from the cold, so hopefully in the heat it will perform better because in Texas cars get very hot!"
4,SWC Tan & Black SW-68T,"Bought it for my wifes new SUV, it looks sporty & nice..only gripe about it, is that the stitching on the top of it looks kinda crooked, must of gotten the bad batch. But other than that I give it a 4 star, instead of 5 star."
4,Stellar example of southern rap.,"I first got interested in ESG after hearing soem guest work he did on Big Moe's City of Syrup, so I decided to pick this album up. It's a really good album, an example of southern rap as it should be.The standout song to me is the screwed mix of Swanging and Banging. I've always had a liking for screwed mixes of songs, and this one seems particularly good. They also have a normal speed version on the CD which just doesn't seem as good for some reason.If you like southern rap, this is definately something to listen to."
5,Swangin n' Bangin,"This is a down south classic from beginning to end if you dont have this you need to pick it up by far his best album ever every track is great but the standouts are #'s 6,11 and 12"
3,"Going After Cacciato - Confusing, but interesting.","I rated this book a three based on O'brien's The Things They Carried. I thought that book was a five, but was disappointed with Going After Cacciato. It was great and very interesting in the beginning, but later trailed off and was boring and confusing. I felt O'brien left too many holes to be filled in with our own imagination - why! It's his story, his writing, why not tell it like it is man! Stop sending us dribbling a basketball backwards down a football field man! The imagination and pretending that Berlin used a lot in the book was very good, but it also added to the confusion and easily threw me off. If you want to read both The Things They Carried and Going After Cacciato, read Cacciato first, otherwise it will only be a disappointment."
3,"Not as good as ""Things They Carried""","If you read ""Going After Cacciato"" after reading Tim O'Brien's ""The Things They Carried,"" prepare for a minor disappointment. The novel is at it's best during those stand-alone chapters that read like short tales from ""TTTC."" O'Brien's meditation on duty and obligation versus the desire to flee is fine, but somewhat light. Written in 1979, it almost feels as if he is being too careful about not offending anyone as he brings up the distasteful subject of the Vietnam War. It would be particularly inappropriate for teachers to assign this novel to their students to understand what the Vietnam War was like for the soldiers who fought it. For that task, I highly recommend THE THIRTEENTH VALLEY by John Del Vecchio and FIELDS OF FIRE by James Webb."
4,Great book but not O'Brien's best.,"This is a amazingly vivid piece of work, however I felt like I was missing something. I would suggest ""The Things They Carried"" first, then after you understand what O'Brien is about, I would recommend this book."
3,view of war,"I did not like this book because it went from a chapter of real events, to the next chapter going to unreal events. The observation posts did not tie the book together for me. His view of war is spot on."
5,One of O'Brien's Best,"Tim O'Brien shows why he is one of the truly great writers of the 20th century. Going After Cacciato is a masterfully written novel that works on so many different levels. O'Brien reveals the mental strain and the incredible toll of war by showing how Paul Berlin uses the imaginary journey after Cacciato to escape the day-to-day horrors that he experiences in Vietnam and come to terms with his feelings about them. O'Brien's use of psuedo-flashbacks gives the story a decidedly surreal feel. He flawlessly weaves detailed, eloquent descriptions of the land and actions with ""grunt-speak"" and harsh depictions of everyday horrors. The resulting mix is quintissential O'Brien and will keep you enthralled to the end. Not just a novel for war story fans, Going After Cacciato should be read by anybody who enjoys literature."
4,A moving war story,"GOING AFTER CACCIATO is more difficult to read than Tim O'Brien's earlier stories about the Vietnam war. Thoroughly enjoyable, sometimes confusing, the reader suspects, but does not know until late in the novel, that the major plotline exists in the imagination of one of O'Brien's characters. The book is compelling, near impossible to put aside, and presents a rare inside look at a troubling war and the ways it influenced the men conducting it."
3,Going After Cacciato,"Going After Cacciato by Tim O'Brien is an OK book. I like the concept behind the story, however, the way the book jumps back and forth in time makes it confusing and hard to follow. I feel I would have like it better if I could have had a better sense of the sequence of events, and which events actually happened and which were metaphorical. This book offered an interesting insight into the mind of a soldier during the war, and how they handled their experiences in the towns and cities on the way to Paris."
4,More fantasy than the battle,"Of the O'Brien Vietnam books, this is the weakest. While the concerted opinion is this is the best, it depends on what is wanted and enjoyed. I felt, when the book turned to a fantasy adventure and chase, it went beyond believable. Allegory can be fine and O'Brien has points to make, but that is not the interest of many who want the brutal facts and reality of a gruesome situation. The book is elegantly written, as are all of O'Brien's works. I cannot say it wasn't enjoyable. It was. But to a lesser degree than others.Ron Lealos author of Don't Mean Nuthin'"
4,"A bit strange, but a good read.","This book is about the Vietnam War...but is also not about the war, but rather a trek to Paris that ends up being one of those ""it was all just a dream"" scenarios. Kinda hate that.Having said that, this book is fast paced and very unpacked so it's an easy and pleasant read. I used this one when I was on the exercise bike and it usually kept me on longer than I'd usually go, so it's not all that bad."
2,Just didn't get it...,"I had never read anything by Tim O'Brien before ""Going After Cacciato"", and I had high hopes for this novel ... Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I don't know, maybe I just didn't get it. Yes, there were some moving scenes and some well-written passages, but in my opinion they were few and far between. Yes, the plot was surreal, but it was also flat. I would give this book 2.5 stars if that were an option because I think Tim O'Brien does have some talent. However, this book just didn't do anything for me. I always judge a book based on if I would recommend it to my friends or family, and I cannot think of anyone I know that would truly enjoy this book."
2,Going After Cacciato,"This was a boring book to read. It was confusing by flipping between story lines. By the end of the book I just wanted to get it over with. The ending(last few chapters) were sheer torture to read. I have no idea how this book could have gotten any award, or be on any recommended reading list."
1,Bad written novel,"I thought that this book was poorly written. However, his insight leads to an intense examination of the life and mindset of a soldier. The soldiers in the story talk like soldiers, but they just seem like real people with a horrible burden thrust upon their shoulders. Also, O'Brien's writing is delightful. Speaking from a purely syntactical standpoint, the way he crafts his sentences is a pleasure to read, even if it describes something horrible in Paul's life. Over all, I did not like this book at all and NOT recommend it to ANYONE!!!"
4,"Brilliant, but ponderous","I read this book immediately after having read O'Brien's later Vietnam novel The Things They Carried, which I also highly recommend.The story is gripping, the characters well-drawn, and the descriptions of jungle warfare, the endless drudgery and fearful monotony of the soldier's day-to-day lives, and the adventures they endure make for powerful and unputdownable reading; however I was left wondering what was real and what was only imagined.Highly recommended, yet not for those who like their plots neatly tied together."
4,"Confusing, but good","This book was very complex, and at times I felt completely lost in understanding the plot. Tim O'Brien masterfully combined three different stories with three different time periods into one complete novel. The book adressed many of the important issues of the Vietnam War that would be beneficial for almost any history enthusiast. Even though it was a bit difficult to follow, this book was amazingly written, and I highly recommend reading it."
4,Providing Views in New Way,"""For just as happines is more than the absence of sadness, so is peace infinitely more than the absence of war."" This quote from Tim O'Brien's Going After Cacciato represents the basic theme of the book. O'Brien uses a strange man named Paul Berlin to illustrate the realities and illusions of the Vietnam war. Through Berlin's imaginative trek to Paris he presents views for and against the war. Although the characters and plot are not real, the book leaves a disturbingly realistic impression of war. The book flows like a person's thoughts, through imagination and real events to bring a complete picture of the psychological effects of Vietnam. At times this gets confusing but overall the effect is new and different. And most of all O'Brien shows that although Berlin leaves the war, it is not absent from his life because he has not yet found peace."
2,"Dude, I just didn't get it","I thought ""In the Lake of the Woods"" and ""The Things They carried"" were amazingly powerful works. But everyone said ""Wait until you read Cacciato!"" Well, I read it. What the hell? Parts are really good: the troop in Iran, the subplot involving the troop's dead lieutenant, the gradual evolving of Cacciato's character. As a whole, however, there was no coherence or cohesiveness and just a little too much mysticism. Characters using fantasy to overcome grim reality seem to be an important part of O'Brien's work but he pulls out all the stops here."
2,Not Equal to His Other Books,"Expecting the best of O'Brien after reading his other novels, I was sorely dissapointed. Something which I cannot put my finger on and that was so successful and in both of the aforementioned books seemed to be lacking in this novel. Perhaps this novel contained, at times, too much narrative. O'Brien's powerful themes were wasted in this book, rather IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS was a better and more artistic display of responsiblity, perception, and misperception as themes, while THE THINGS THEY CARRIED was more shocking and raw in terms of the Vietnam foot soldier's life and mentality. Though worth the investment of time, a better experience could be extracted from one of O'Brien's other novels."
1,Worst travel book I've ever read,"A friend of mine took this with him to Ukraine, and I got to leaf through it. It's horrible. The woman who wrote it obviously hated the experience of being there; from the poor infrastructure to the people. Glorious cities are disparaged with a couple of pages of sightseeing recommendations, bad information, and, well, at least the maps were reasonable, though they needed more Cyrillic in them. The Bradt guide (my choice) is better, though it had its own set of problems."
1,"Pin holes for me, too","We purchased two hoses last summer because of our limited storage space, and they worked fine. When we set up the hoses last week (they were stored in a heated garage all winter) they both developed multiple pin holes almost simultaneously. These leaks are extensive enough to seriously affect the water pressure delivered to the nozzle. The hoses are useless.We do not want to buy new hoses every year, so I have switched to another manufacturer's product."
4,Good Product,"This jack had easy, quality assembly, and was easy to install on the cable. Noted the contacts inside seemed to fit a bit loose on the Shore Mount Plug in our RV, but within the range of what I would consider acceptable. I would buy it again for the ease of assembly and quality construction."
5,Works great,"I was looking at buying a 110 / 30 amp adapter but for $60+, I made my own that works just as well."
3,A very helpful book for any parent of a child with ADD/ADHD,"This book is a very good ""first book"" to start with if you are researching how to help your child. It is written in simple terms that parents can understand. It gives helpful tips on setting up your child's environment in order to help them be more successful. I have read many books on this subject, and this is a staple book for any parent of a child with ADD/ADHD."
5,This is the best book on ADD/ADHD I have read,"I have purchased many books on ADD/ADHD, and have found this one to be the best! The rest of the books on ADD have all found their way to the tip or to fete bookstores over the years. This book provides both practical and detailed advice for parents in the form of useful checklists. Other books on this subject matter tend to be too fatalistic and theoretical. This is pro-active and practical!I thoroughly recommend this book."
4,"Hard work, but worth it","We couldn't rent a mechanical auger because we had to dig a hole line up the rails and dig the next hole. So, we bought this manual post hole auger. It worked great. We dug 65 holes with it. Now, we have a nice fence to show for it."
4,Violin,"This product is nice for the price. It must be tuned. If you do not know how to do this, you must take it to someone that does. I purchased this for a nine year old. It may be better suited to someone older."
4,inconsistent texture but does seem to work,"Sometimes this product has the texture of toothpaste and other tubes are VERY runny! I prefer the toothpaste texture because the cat will lick it off of my finger if it will only STAY there. However, that said, either way, once I get it in her, it works well."
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,"It ended up being a similar brand / flavor. not ""Kittymalt""Worked ok, but not what my cats were hoping for."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I bought this and at first I thought it was going to work. But, after two days of using this, my cat started throwing up again and became lethargic. I discontinued using it and went back to Petromalt. Now, my cat is perking up again and getting sick less. It may work good for others, but not with my cat."
1,Don't bother,"I read reviews before I purchased this and some said their cats wouldn't touch it. I used a hairball remedy similar to this years ago and my cats loved it; however, none of my three cats would touch this."
2,Its ok,"This product is much cheaper than competitor ""Petromalt"" and I guess you get what you pay for. The KittyMalt is very runny and greasy and our cats do not like it. The Petromalt is thick, and stays where you put it and the cats go crazy for it. I don't know if we just got a bad tube of it, but I will not buy again. You get 1/2 as much product for more money of the Petromalt, but its worth the extra money."
5,Works like it says it should,I got this product because my cats seemed to be trying to hack up hairballs but were just not getting the job done (although they were managing to wake me up almost every night). The paste is really greasy but two of my three cats love it and think they are getting a teat when they see the tube. I just put a little on a spoon and they lick it right up. I have been giving it to them once or twice a week now for a month or so and the hacking is much less and I have not been awakened in the night to strange kitty noises. I would recomend this to someone who's cat is not too picky because I don't think it would be a good time to try and get a cat to eat it if they do not want to.
4,perfect snack size,I wish it was made with whole grain flour instead of wheat flour which doesn't mean much.
5,Another delightful masterpiece,"Eric Andersen has struck gold with You Can't Relive the Past. I love the variety of song styles, and my favorite song is ""Eyes of the Immigrant"", both for its theme and its gorgeous lyrics and melody. Its opening reminds me of ""Moonchild River Song"" from years back. Every Eric Andersen fan should buy this CD immediately-it's great!"
5,Original West Cyde style at its prime,"Lil Half Dead has made three central contributions to the hiphop world, ""Steel on a Mission"" ""The dead has risen"" and the cd single ""Hood Life"". Individually all three contributions are three alternatives of the best west side G-funk you can find. ""Steel on a mission"" is a must have in any original hiphop connection!"
5,Lil HD gets you crusin!!!,"possibly one of the greatest G-Funk albums ever made, 1/2 Dead gets you crusin buy this album if you are a true rap fan it is worth you're money"
3,Good for fans,"Great book on all of his works, from his early films in the Netherlands, all the way up through the repulsively awful 'Hollow Man'. If you're a fan, this is a fantastic compendium to his films, with some great pictures and original script pages. The critiques are hit or miss, but the information is pretty solid. Recommended for fans, but would probably be really dull if you aren't a fan.Some really interesting behind-the-scenes stuff on his Hollywood films that make for great reading for fans of 'Robocop', 'Total Recall', 'Basic Instinct', 'Showgirls' and others.It's kind of cool to read the statistical data on the individual films as well. Things like box office take domestically versus globally, cost of production, etc.If you're a Verhoeven fan, you will probably enjoy this, others need not apply though."
5,Classic Director,"These Taschen books have a reputation for being coffee table books. They contain great images, so this is justified.But they also combine pretty good words to accompany the images, and this edition on Verhoeven is no different.The written information in this book is both informative and interesting (if you are interested in cinema that is), and while it is not loaded with academic insight (look somewhere else if that's what your after) it is full up with a chronological time line about the Dutch films and Hollywood films Verhoeven has made - as well as an insight into what made this guy into the ultra violent, sex minded director he is."
1,Useless,"The book series by APress is called ""Expert's Voice"". Well this author uses the same old StockQuote example. It is impossible to view this book as an Experts Voice when the same old lame code examples are re-used or the code itself is just junior. The cover states ""Master the Mobile Internet Toolkit"" yet there is little coverage. There is NOTHING in this book that you cannot pick up in the QuickStarts. Nothing. It contains so little information that I'm ashamed I even bought it. Let's face it, Apress really knows how to use whitespace and fonts to fill up pages!Save your money."
2,Obfuscatory? Probably,"Wayman's translation is a noble effort, and has probably been of some use to academics and fearless students of the Lam rim tradition.However, his approach to the translation of a part of the Lam-rim chen-mo (quite possibly the most important text on spiritual paths ever written) is questionable in approach and methodology; often Wayman uses inappropriate occidental paradigms, and also misses idiomatic phrases, which would have been clarified if he had relied more upon the active interpretations availiable in the Tibetan academic community. Secondly, the grammar and sentential structure of his English text is not particularly clear, and although considerably better than his translations of the concentration and wisdom chapters (ASIN-0231044046), the text remains pretty obfuscatory.As a rule, I would heartily recommend the new translation as an alternative- ASIN-1559391669.Or even better, to learn Tibetan and read it in the original."
4,THIS TAPE IS TIGHT,"HEY THIS IS GRAHAM HERE AND I GOTTA TELL YOU THIS TAPE IS PRETTY DOPE. E-FLEEZY, 4TAY AND A GANG OF OTHER PLAYERS SPIT ON THIS ALBUM TO MAKE IT EXTRA TIGHT. MY FAVORITE SONG IS THE ONE WITH E-40 AND JT: BEWARE OF THOSE!"
2,Too convoluted,"What I found difficult about this book is the flow. It seemed to jump around a lot with it's time line and kept referencing a lot of different people. The specific issue I have is if you are going to go to the detail of mentioning a lot of different people (all with german names, obviuosly.) then please put some sort of reference table in the book listing who these people are by time line, position, rank (if applicable) and their contribution to the project. I found myself constantly having to go back into earlier chapters to try and remember who this or that person was. I admit I have a hard time remembering names, but I found this book nearly unreadable."
4,"Great book, but its Hebrew transliterations are faulty","The book was clearly a labor of love for its author, and I get a lot of useful info out of it. The author should have had someone check the Hebrew transliterations in the book, however. In the first chapter Collins shows the Hebrew letters for the word ""v'lo'Nefilin"" and transliterates it as Nefilim. He shows the Hebrew letters for the word ""bnei elohim"" and transliterates it as ""bnei ha-elohim.""On the plus side, the publisher has gone to the added expense of inserting actual Hebrew letters into the text, so one can skip the faulty transliterations if one knows Hebrew.I give it a four stars because sometimes the information in the book seems a little bit off, as in the transliterations. But if you are at all interested in alternative archaeologies or alternative forms of traditional religions by all means buy this book. I rank it up there with the works of Zecharia Sitchin."
2,Not happy,"Guess I just don't care for Andrew Collins. Book read much too slow. Too much repeating of the material. Per the reviews, thought I would enjoy his work."
3,Very interesting but poorly written,"This is a very interesting book with lots of new ways to look at Biblical stories and Eastern mythologies, but Andrew Collins style of writing leaves so much to be desired that it makes the reading very heavy going. He seems to finish every 3rd sentence with a question mark - ""Could it be?"" ""Does this mean that?"" so I just found myself scanning the pages for the hosts of question marks in the text! He also tends to make huge leaps to connect facts that he states as being 'obviously' and 'irrefutably' true when really they are tenuous or just interesting connections.I'm very interested in Near Eastern mythology, biblical apocrypha, nephilim and watcher legends etc so this was a worthwhile book for me. I just feel that Collins needs to work on his writing to make it more academic and less sensationalist.I'd give this book a 4 or 5 for interesting content but really only a 2 for the way it is written."
3,Ashes of Angels,This book gets two stars just because it doesn't have any mathematical equations in it. I found this to be a a methodical explanation of the authors thinking process. A little too methodical at times and there were occassions when my mind wandered ahead of content. Reading this book I got to wishing that these authors(you know who you are)would remember that their audience has already taken the leap of faith and we no longer require the painful and boring scientific detail of how you got to thinking this way. More meat and less potatoes please.
1,Dire!,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Almost every page is riddled with errors of the most fundamental nature. That said, the book is very funny (despite itself). Witness, for instance, Collins' indignation at the reaction of worshippers at a Zoroastrian temple to being called ""Fire-Worshippers"". Absolutely hilarious! Strictly for Goths and David Icke fans."
4,Looking for books,"I have not as of yet read any of these books but in looking at and reading the synopsis on some of them this makes me very much want to do so, so with that I would like to ask if there is anyone out there that has an extra copy of them that they can send me - I checked out one of Zecharia Sitchin's books at a library a while back but had difficulty getting through it:But here's the ones that I would like to read:The lost book of Enki - Zecharia SitchinGods of the new millenium - Alan AlfordThe Phoenix Solution - Alan AlfordFrom the Ashes of Angels - Andrew CollinsIf you have an extra copy sent to:DennisPO Box 2783Newport Beach CA 92659"
5,"Review of Corey Dillon Action Figure, McFarlane Toys",This McFarlane Toys sports action figure of Corey Dillon is quite well done. One of the good things about McFarlane is the attention to detail they put into their action figures. This figure is very life like and even has Dillon's tattoos displayed. This figure features Dillon airborne and is held up by stand that swivels and pivots to allow you to position the figure in a way that most pleases your eye. A big thumbs up for this one.
3,Question...,"I want to dance to ""Angel Rays"" by Gemma Hayes with my dad at my wedding. Unfortunatly when I ordered the CD she was not singing it! It is another band, not like in the movie!! Can Somone help me find a copy with her singing it?? Thank you!"
4,Great price,"As this is common item cat owners buy, the quality is as expected. This site does have the best pricing now that it is in the 4 for 3 sale. Since I have 4 cats I use a lot of this per month and they all like this brand."
1,My Cat didn't like...,My cat hate this flovar...I need to mixed with his food otherwise it will go to waste. I will try another flovar....
4,It Helps,"I have an extremely long-haired cat who has constant problems with coughing up hairballs. Using this product doesn't eliminate the problem, but it helps. Also my cat just loves the taste. He thinks it is a real treat!"
1,Scratching my head,"I recently have heard a few things about this singer-songwriter and thought I'd check out a few of his CD's including this one. I must be missing something here. I have been heavy into music since the early '60's and am a big fan of Dylan, Lennon, etc. but I simply don't see the fuss over this guy. He sounds like some local coffee shop singer who sometimes has some interesting lyrics but the music isn't very inventive at all. It has a total lack of melody and the guitar playing is simple. Sorry I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I know."
4,Nice work,Good watch that gives you some opportunities to play. The compas and the thermometer is however not that functional when placed on the wrist.
3,Fair WWII Movie,"Granted this Movie is not up to Saving Private Ryan Standards, but it has a good plot and the action is decent. I would never pay 17 bucks for it though( I got it for 7 on DVD from Wal Mart). If you can get it cheap buy it. If not,forget it!"
1,Avoid this movie!!!,"Wow. This movie is so amazingly bad. Bashed together with WW2 stock footage and scenes from Tobruk (A film which has the same plot), this sorry excuse for a movie is a waste of time. Richard Burton was tossed into this mess to help rake in more cash at the box office. Wolfgang Preiss is a good Rommel though. Nevertheless, AVOID THIS MESS!"
3,Raid On Rommel with Sir Ricard Burton,An explosive filmRichard Burton and Star Trek villain John Colicos play British intelligence officers who attack German desert defenses in this 1971 film. The best battle scenes are toward the end of the film when Burton's character sets the base aflame with his tanks and flame-throwers. It was exciting to see him a realistic action hero. There were no Stallone like scenes with him out fighting the enemy. He was more clever and deceptive in making the Nazi's believe he was one of them. They discovered that he wasn't the man he presented himself to be far too late. He led the Nazi's to think he was treating his soldiers for Typhoid fever.John Colicos role was that of a supporting actor to Burton. It made me realize that he had a lot more talent than given credit for. I wish he had more dialogue with Burton other than taking orders and following the leader.
2,Even Richard Burton Cannot Salvage this one!,"This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Despite the fact that it stars one of my all-time favourite actors, Richard Burton. Then again, if you glance down Burton's credits, he's starred in his fair shair of duds."
1,Too small!!!!,"This pouch is advertised as being suitable for lens storage. Only a very skinny, and short, old style film camera lens, a Leica maybe, could possibly fit in this tiny pouch, and I got the LARGE one. Forget about modern lenses, even a short prime wideangle won't fit. I guess I'll continue using Crown Royal pouches. At least they come with the added benefit of some good hooch."
4,house shoes,"I do not really like this style, but I have bought it to have comfortable house shoes and they were on clearance."
2,Broke after a few uses,At first this seemed like a great product. After a month or so or use one of the attachments started to pop off of the hose during use. Nothing like having water shower you during numerous times of doing chores.
3,3.5 Stars-- A Sweet Little Mystery,"Minor vandalism is much more the specialty of Mosley than murder but when the prodigal heiress Brenda Cryer returns home and is murdered, Mosley is assigned to the case.Mosley is a wonderful example of the seemingly bumbling detective played against the foil of whiz-kid Sergant Beamish. His random clues and wild goose chases lead them to find a killer.Nothing spectacular, but a nice little book."
3,"Another ""the subwoofer bites"" customer","...I ... am having problems with the subwoofer. I followed the directions to the letter, and it works for about 45 seconds (on maximum volume)and it is very quiet, too... then it dies. I called AIWA support number, only to talk to a rude and uncaring representative. The system itself is really great otherwise........easy to set up and the surround system sounds GREAT. But, I need to know why the subwoofer doesn't work. I truly think it is in the setup and connection, even though I had an expert hooking it up for me. ..."
2,a good system with some major flaws,"i got mine from a friend so i didn't get any speakers or remote but with the 6 speakers i have it works well accept I cant have the volume over 17 without it turning itself off.about the sub problem i agree they most likely forgot to change a setting but if you think you've done everything right (right settings, right calls to costomer support ect.) and it still doesn't work; deal with it or return it.but overall i think its a good machine (that needs to be able to use its full potential)."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"First thing first, how do i get the subwoofer to work properly. We had it working then, it stopped. I was a little disappointed with the sound & the instructions in the manual. Thank God for tech. support. Eventually, i'll add better speakers later to satisfy my need for bass & good sound."
2,Makes learning a language fun!,The Rosetta Stone program is user friendly and really fun to use! The voice recognition feature is very beneficial in helping learn to properly speak the language. The interaction holds your attention and improves retention of the information.
5,A Seductive Spy Thriller!!,"In this 1941 film,Illona Massey stars as a breathtakingly beautiful musician and just about every man in the audience has an eye on her especially a duo of American and British Agents who knows that she's actually a Nazi Spy and start chasing her through the cities of New York and London.This movie is an excellent,seductive spy thriller!!"
5,Great movie for the WHOLE family,"I rarely purchase a movie without seeing it first, but I made an exception with ""Hometown Legend."" I love football movies and Jerry Jenkins novels are so above par, that I had a feeling that this movie would be worth the money. Well, I'm happy I followed my instincts! What a great movie. If you love small town/football movies, you will LOVE this one. When people tell you that it was made for ONLY 2 Million dollars, don't let that keep you from this movie. The cinematography is excellent, the acting is superb and there is absolutely no OVER acting that we so commonly see. Incredible movie! I highly recommend it for the whole family!"
2,A let down,"If you have not read the book then go for it and watch the movie. If you have read the book be carefull not to get your hopes up like I did. Three of the caracters that gave the books meening are missing. They do not talk at all about the football factory, nothing but a brief mentioning of being in foster care for jacksons history,coach shullers wife is not a part of the movie,and finaly the narrator part is cut down so much he seems at times not even present the movie is told by his daughter and coach shullers point of veiws. Althogh I understand cutting some parts I feel they cut way to much when it comes to this vidio."
5,Family Football Flick,"This is the ideal Family movie. Dads and sons will love it because it's Football! Wives will love it because it's something that can bring the whole family together. Plus the story has a great point-family is what you make it, and even more importantly, family is Who you make it.This film really captures the soul of high school football. You win some and you lose some. This one is a winner!Hometown Legend (Snap Case)"
5,Hometown Legend,Great movie with a positive message to preserve our principles and values.High recomended for the family.
5,My Bulldog's Fav!,"I have an English Bulldog who is incredibly healthy and has the softest shiniest coat (which bulldogs DO NOT normally have). She's at her ideal weight too, and I credit alot to the Artemis!"
4,Smells like you have money!,Gucci Envy smells nice. It goes on strong so do not over use. Later it starts to dry down and has a softer smell. It smells like you have money.
5,Gucci Envy,"This particular gucci product is my husbands favourite and I love the fond memories it evokes when I smell it on him. Imagine my horror to be told that it had been discontinued !!I searched high and low;often being fobbed off with an imitation but finally found it - albeit in america. Yes, I did pay a premium price for it - but he is worth it !!Delivery was amazing ! - just 4 days - even though they did not promise delivery before Christmas. Happy faces all round !"
3,Great pics OK biography,"I've been a fan of Neve's ever since seeing her in 'Wild Things'. Neve looks absolutely beautiful in all the photographs in this book.The photos were the only reason I bought the book.I've only skimmed through the biography,I haven't read it cover to cover. It's no Booker Prize Winner but I still prefer this book to 'Great Expectations'."
4,The wonderful Neve,"This was a good book. I would say about 80 percent of the book talks about her rise in television; from simple commercials to Party of Five to the various movies she was in, up to Scream 3. The rest explains a little about her, her family, and things she has done when she was growing up. There were a few things I read about her that I would have never guessed. Overall, this book is very informative and if you read it front to back, you will learn a lot about her and understand who she really is."
1,NC Book,This book is ok. There is to much info on the actors she has worked w/ and not enough about her. I also would love if there were more info on her brother Christian. All in all it isn't a bad book. Some miss information but all in all an ok book. If your a Neve Campbell fan you'll enjoy it. Go buy it now.
3,"Great pics of beautiful Neve,OK biography","I bought this book because I've been a fan of Neve since seeing her in Wild Things. I've only skimmed through the book,I haven't read it cover to cover.The pics are fantastic.Definitely the best part of the book.Overall,it's OK.No Booker Prize winner but I still like it better than ""Great Expectations"""
2,"A totally unlikable main character, and a mean spirited story.","I've enjoyed previous books by Jane Heller, but this one was a stinker. Mel, the main character, is a mean-spirited workaholic. Her magic change of character at the end of the book just wasn't believable. I disliked her through the book, and didn't like her better at the end. Why did Ethan like her, anyway? The only thing she seemed to have going for her was good hair and big boobs. Her personality was rotten.There was also a petty attitude regarding women paying alimony. Why shouldn't they? I was left wondering if Jane Heller got stuck with a nasty divorce settlement.I won't be rushing out to buy any new books from this author. Try the library for this one."
1,pug fart jokes an underwhelming thrill,"The characters never come to life, it's paint by the numbers; given this uninspiring drivel a plot outline would suffice ....do people really buy this stuff? And the pug ""fart"" jokes were something one would expect to hear in a mentally challenged grade school. Find something you're good at, Jane."
1,Misleading pic,"Generic flaps, they did fit... kind of...I had to drill holes but I expected bolt on ones made for my car..but for $6 they will do for now, I will be surprised if they make it thru the winter. The picture is a fair representation of the ones on my car, but the ones that came were generic in shape and listed for dozens and dozens of cars..... They will do till I get the significantly thicker original ones."
3,Better for Older Kids,"I purchased this book to try and get some ideas for fun and interesting activities that I could engage my daughter in so that she could learn at the same time. I was really excited about getting this book because I have found that I have run out of ideas fairly quickly.After receiving and reviewing this book, I found that, though there are a lot of fun activities listed, none were all that appropriate for my 18 month old. I think that this book will be a great resource as she gets older, and I try and modify activities for her learning level. However, I would probably recommend that those considering purchasing this book, make sure that you are purchasing it for kids who are 3 and older."
1,Do not buy this peice of crap you will be sorry,"An abosolute dont buy. this tv contains faulty components, and poor quality craftsmanship! Mine had quit working 2 months after i purchased it and i could not return it to the store and it would have cost 271$ shipping 1 way to get it back to the manufacturer for service."
3,Pretty but needs better construction,"Pros:PrettySoftDoesn't soak up liquids (if you're driving and you spill your drink you can still take your time pulling over and taking the cover off without having to worry about your seat getting soaked- great with my little one)Cons:One of my seats ripped within two months of purchaseThey attract hair and dirt far more than I would likeOverall I've had mine for three years now and with the exception of the ripped one, they keep everything clean and still look nice."
2,Seatcover Review,"The seat covers are cute, but only 1 comes in a box and while I was putting them in my car one of them ripped! Obviously the quality is not very good."
5,"Looks Great, Love the Blue","Blue is my favorite color and these seat covers go perfectly with the color of my car. Whenever someone gets in they compliment the seat covers, have had them for at least 4 years...wish I could find this style in other items but they don't seem to sell it anymore."
4,Seat Covers,They are velvetie soft and pretty. I like them. But I wish I could get them to stop sliding up off the seat.
3,It only comes with 1 cover Not 2,MAKE SURE YOU ORDER 2. THE AD SAYS IT'S SOLD IN A PAIR BUT IT'S NOT! YOU HAVE TO ORDER A 2ND ONE.
3,Bowron BabyCare Soft Lambskin,"This is a luxurious product for my toddler's bed. I placed this lambskin between the waterproof matress pad and the very noisy plastic covered toddler bed mattress. My toddler sleeps more soundly now.I did not expect the slight ""dish"" in the center area of the lambskin. This is a little problematic for it's intended purpose but my toddler doesn't seem to mind now that she is used to the new countours of her little bed.This will be a perfect product for my soon-to-arrive infant when ""big sib"" gets ready for a big kid bed."
3,an arousing music,"I am glad that circumstances allow me to hear the CD entitled,""Sweet Surrender"". Its was an enjoyable moment. The track ""Mystical"" has a good beat, good energy and a smooth jazz sound. In fact, I usually play it several times a day. Personality, It has an arousing sound that makes me move! I recommend you check it out. Then add it to your music library, MP3 player or Ipod for those days when you need some good mood music to uplift you!"
5,The Book all Craniosacral Therapist should own!,"If you are trained in Craniosacral Therapy, especially under Upledger's model, this book is for you! If you found Upledger's book a bit dry or difficult to plod through and not an easy resource or want more information ont how CST and restrictions relate to all of the organ sytems,glands,tissues and diseases this book is a must have. It is very,very informative and difficult medical concepts are broken down to an understandable level. It made the lightulbs go off in my head. Once you can feel the CS pulse you can use this book to learn how to heal more than you ever imagined. You do not need the first volume,if you are already a CST. If you are not, but are any type of energy practioner the first volume would be a good resource to have, but this second volume can stand alone. I love this book.It is well worth every penny it costs!"
1,The product that was shipped to me was deffective.,The product was shipped to me with a taped cap. I didn't think anything of it until when I started to use it. I still had some of of previous purchased product from another seller so it took time before I opened this one. The product was watery and I was told by a salon stylish that the product was either defective or outdated. The seller was unwilling to resolve this issue for me since the purchase date was elapsed for their return policy.
4,Seems to be working,"When I first tried Nioxin, I got system 4. It made my head itch like crazy and so I decided to try system 3. I still have some itching, but my husband says my hair looks much thicker and even though I don't think so, I am going to keep using it. I've only been using the products for about 3 months and my hair dresser said it would take about 6 months to notice a difference. I will keep it up until then."
4,Scalp Therapy,I've used Nioxin in the past and had pretty good results. I found that using it for a couple of months then changing to another product for awhile did best for my hair. The one thing about the Scalp Therapy they put out now is that the ingredients and even the name of the product is different and along with that is the results I get...not as good as the original product was. I do like the minty smell..at least they left it in the ingredients even if it is not as noticable as it used to be. My question is why change something that already works???
3,unfortunately the picture when I ordered this product depicted Scalp Activating Treatment SPRAY,"So that is what I thought I was getting. I received Nioxin Scalp Therapy and I will not exchange it but will use it a few months from now seeing as how I have a 33 oz bottle of this that I found at a better price...and am using now :(Don't want, however, this review having received a different item to reflect on the performance of Nioxin which I have been using faithfully for 3 years and am VERY SATISFIED with using all 3 items in conjunction with the other.Mary"
1,NOT FOR ME!,ON THE FIRST USE IT TURNED MY (COLOR TREATED GOLDEN BLONDE) HAIR GREEN! NOT A SHOCK I CARE TO REPEAT! MAYBE IT'S JUST ME.
3,Not sure it grows new hair but I like it,"Leaves my hair feeling fuller and softer, easier to control and a nice smell. Liter bottles mean that I don't have to buy it very often."
2,thinning hair,I was told takes awhile help hair grow in .........been using it few months no change. Dont order number 3 it is for color treated hair it has pppermint fragrance to it and burns your eyes while in shower and still after rinsed off . .......burns my eyes
4,Does the job,"While the smell is a bit strong I can tell a difference in my hair. I've got the fine, flyaway type hair and I've always had a shedding problem. I've got plenty of it but hate having to constantly brush my clothes. This product has slowed that down and my hair looks good."
5,Great,"I have been using Nioxin for 3 years. Its expensive in Hawaii, and this product was a great deal for the price!"
4,Feels good,I have used this product in the past. It really feel great on your scalp. My hair feel fuller. I like it.
2,"I don't see any results, don't like the medicine smell","Following a surgery I had a lot of hair loss due to stress to the system and harsh medicines in the hospital and after care. My hair dresser noticed the problem with my hair and recommended this product. I've always trusted her opinion and decided to give it a try.I just finished my first bottle of daily use. I don't see any difference in the amount of hair I see in the drain after I wash my hair, nor do I notice any additional fullness in. In addition to lack of perceptible results I don't like the smell (medicine-like somewhat minty smell, reminded me of mouthwash). And it is expensive!I just finished the first bottle and it will be my last.Ali Julia review"
5,Truly is a beauty,"I have been a fan of Bury Your Dead ever since I first heard their album ""Cover Your Tracks"", and this album is definately just as good. A very hard album with amazing vocals that deserves a lot of respect. Metalcore fans all over the world can truly appreciate the hard work that went into this album and if you are a metalcore fan don't let this CD not be a part of your collection!!"
1,so bad,"i bought several watches in the amazon,but i bought this tissot sems not original and the therefore the partiesis is fading gold leaf,how can we fix this already that is very famous brand and very expensive."
1,Can't reinstall rear bumper with this hitch,"Bought this hitch based on the price. Once it arrived, I read the directions only to find that once the hitch is installed, you cannot reattach the stock rear bumper. The outside of the box read something about a tube bumper so I don't know if you could mount a tube rear bumper. I returned it for a refund with no problem from Amazon."
1,Works great... if you want to drill holes and lose your bumper.,"I purchased this hitch for my 2006 Jeep Wrangler. First off, the hitch I received looks nothing like the one in the picture. It was, however, designed to fit a wide range of Wranglers, including a 2006. I followed the instructions up to the point where you are required to drill holes for the hitch. I stopped and looked at the hitch for a minute and realized something: the factory bumper can't fit back on once the hitch is installed. I then looked through the rest of the instructions and noticed that there is no mention of putting the bumper back on. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,The hand of a child.,"I bought this as a gag joke to put in my trunk as i'm sure most of you will. While realistic, this hand is really on the small side and would only pass for a smaller person or young teenager (with wrinkly features). Either way it's still a bang for your buck. With a little paint on the fingernails so they don't look like skin and a shirt pinned to the sleeve this looks believable."
4,weird but fun,"My eight yr old was obsessed with getting this. She saw it hanging off the back of a car. We found it online, the price was well worth it. She LOVES it. Plays with it all the time. She's had it for months and still plays with it. I think it's very weird, but she loved it."
3,Not just for jokes.,I bought this fake arm actually to help with desensitizing a customers dog to having hands touching him. I put a dowel in it restuffed it and now have a very sturdy tool to use to my advantage.
3,O.K. but...,This arm is O.K. but it's not as realistic as I thought it would be. Better if used in dark areas.
1,Junk,"I was assuming that it was going to be the size of a adults hand. Its the size of a toddlers hand and its hard plastic, not soft rubber."
1,bad book,I was very disapointed. The Reason manuel is 10 times better.I went back reading Reason 2.5 power by Michael Prager.Gonna buy his version of 3.0.Should have done it in the first place.
4,Frankie Beverly - live in New Orleans,"Very good DVD I did think the picture quality could have been better, but I do love its contents. Thank-you"
1,Frankie Beverly Live in New Orleans,"I own over 40 dvd's and I have to admit Frankie Beverly's Live in New Orleans dvd audio sound quality does not measure up with any of them. This dvd sounds as if it was produced in mono format. This is not true stereo or dolby digital recorded material. For those that own a high quality system as I do, you will be highly dissappointed in the audio production and picture quality of this low production dvd. I have VHS recordings I've taped off tv that sounds better than this dvd. Frankie get your sound and production crew up to speed in recording and picture format for the great work you do in live performanances!"
5,A Concert in your own livingroom!,"It's a concert in your own livingroom. The music touch your soul, because he's singing from his heart. To know it was made in the city of New Orleans make me know that Maze know in New Orleans we always give a great feed back to them when they perform here. I recommend this DVD greatly! Waiting for Maze At the Essence festival July 4, 2004!!!!!!"
1,THE AUDIO SUCKS!!!,"Hands down this is the worst sounding dvd that I have ever purchased. The irony of it all is that this live concert was one of the best sounding LP's from it's time period. It is a shame that with all of the sales that this recording generated in both LP and CD format it wasn't given a better transfer to dvd. Don't waste your money on this dvd, enjoy the cd or LP."
4,Good DVD,"These guys has always been good performers, DVD concert was good and I will be looking at more Maze & Frankie Beverly."
3,somewhat useful,"I think this book would be more useful if I lived in Europe....it covered many resources available there, vs where I'm at in America. While it did a good job of giving descriptions of dyspraxia, and what it is like for older children with this, it bsically just freaked me out (my daughter is 2.5 years old). I already understood some of the information and was more looking for ideas on things to work on at home with her. There was information on how to find therapies, what early intervention would be like to get into (though again, not as useful for me here as our programs are obviously different), and it kind of glossed over some ideas for things like using velcro instead of laces on their tennis shoes etc. I left slightly dissatisfied as I really was looking more for various exercises I could do at home and there was very little of that actual information in this book, but it did give a decent overview."
2,not the best of pedro infante,"this is not the best of pedro infante , if you like his movies you should get los tres garcia or tizoc."
1,"Amazon has put reviews for ""New Ideas in Backgammon"" here","The reviews are for ""New Ideas in Backgammon"" - a truely excellent book. Not the book that is here ""Winning with the Doubling Cube"" by Peter Bell is however going to make you into a losing player. Avoid at all costs!"
2,Terrible game - way over rated and won't work on a Mac,"This game is old and has never been updated to run on Mac OS X properly.This not not an arcade came, it's a flight simulator, and without special control, you can't expect to operate it from a keyboard and mouse.It's slow, complicated, and very annoying.And then it crashes, repeatedly.Worse, I haven't been able to find any Joy Sticks or controls that work with Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard).MacPro, 4 Gig RAM, ATI Radeon 2600"
1,Guns of the Mountain Man,"I have read 24 of the Mountain Man books. I usually really like William W. Johnstone.The last few I read had several pages of previous books in them but this one, I believe, is the worst. I think at least half of the book is made up of stories that took place in some of his other books. I would like for him not to repeat so much and go on with his present story line. Don't need to reread what I ahve already read."
4,Smoke Jensen does it again!,"This was an excellent novel. Smoke Jensen once again gets his man, this time with some help from past friends and foes he has faced before. In this action packed book, Smoke is up against 50 men, fighting for his ranch, town, and revenge to the men that shot his ranch hand, Cal! This book starts out with action from page one and ends in much more. Never a dull moment, couldn't put the book down. Can't wait until his two new novels arrive!"
5,Very Good,A nice tale of guerilla warfare in the Franco-Prussian war. Home-schooler approved and recommended. Read it again and again and again.
5,A lovely picture book.,"The book contains reproductions of a collection of Cicely Mary Barker's watercolors of flower fairies. Each watercolor is a picture of a child or two represented as fairies of a particular flower. The flowers are beautifully rendered, and the fairy children are dressed in garments that resemble their own flowers. Each picture is accompanied by a poem. Ms. Barker used the children who attended her sister's kindergarten as models with the result that the children are charmingly drawn but perhaps a trifle too realistically for depictions of fairies. Still, it is a delightful book.Also, see Ms. Barker's Treasury of Flower Fairies for a companion book."
3,Strictly for Reference,"I was disappointed in the format which almost felt like I was reading a classified ad. Chock full of information, but too much to digest in one volume."
2,No teaching involved in this book!,"If you want a book to learn from and instruction, don't buy this one."
1,Teaches you nothing,"This book has no instruction that is usable. A waste of time and money. Zbukvic may be a respected artist, but a teacher he is not.One specific--the instruction is based upon the ""watercolor clock"" which is so much unsuable nonsense. It doesn't even stand-up to its own logic. I'm throwing up my hands and throwing this book in the recycling bin."
5,Inspirational and Delightful,"I had not heard of Joseph Zbukvic before but from the first time I saw this title, recommended by Amazon some months ago (while still not published), I felt moved to know more of this artist work. I have been reading and staring at the plates since I got this book some days ago, and in my oppinion it has one of the freshest and most beautiful watercolor works I've seen lately. I love to paint with watercolors and am now in the serious learning process. This book provided me with lots of inspiration and delight. I didn't feel like following his watercolor ""clock"" theory but have to admit that it might work fine to many other people. If you feel like you would love this book, may I recommend to take a look at a like of this one: A. Castagnet's ""Watercolor painting with passion"" (ISBN: 192983408X)."
3,"Great art, eye candy","Instruction should be overlooked (watercolor clock) but brilliant paintings. Get the book to see some great art, but don't expect to instantly paint like this--its far too advanced.All that said--it gets a one star because it puports to be a book of instruction and the instruction is misleading--far more damaging than merely useless."
5,ESSENTIAL,"I think this book is essential for one trying get a handle on this sometimes frustrating medium. One of the critical parts in watercolor painting is judging the amount of water in the paper and on the brush to get the effect one seeks. It's a tricky process but one which this friendly book makes understandable and attainable. I've been painting for 25 years and have bought scores of books on the subject, finding something useful to nearly all of them. But this book, along with two others, I consider to be MUSTS. The others are Robert Lovett's ""The Art of Designing Watercolors"" and Tony Couch's ""Watercolor: You Can Do It."""
5,Beautiful book but not for beginners,"One of the most amazing things about this book besides it gorgeous illustrations is that it is not another cotton candy, trick laden, watercolor book by a workshop star.The artist and the paintings are deep, challenging and beautifull though I am not thrilled by some color choices I am by the integrity and depth this fellow brings to a medium that can all too often be made into wall paper designs.His work is not easily apporached or copied and that is refreshing and daunting at the same time. He says it best when he warns that skill can only come from work and not from tricks. It was an eye opener reading about the effects of dampness and the state of the pigments themselves.I will be humbly working in his shadow for a loooooong while and loving evry moment."
2,Really Poor,"Bought this on super clearance sale, still don't think it was worth the money. Looks nice but parts are cheap, instrument is barely playable. I'd only recommend it as a piece of interior design or a prop in a play."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!,"I bought this for my sons birthday. It shows a BLACK guitar in the picture but what I got (when I finally got it) was the natural color guitar. Now, let's talk about what I got: I got a damaged natural color guitar. Yes, that's it. NO amp, NO gig bag, NO strap, NO tuner, NO cord, and NO picks. Yep, all I got was a damaged guitar. It DID say, on the box the guitar came in, ""amp, gig bag, cord, strap, picks"". I had to open it just to see the worlds smallest amp stuffed inside a guitar box, lol. After closer inspection, it was appearent that the guitar was damaged BEFORE it was boxed up. STAY AWAY for this product. Amazon really needs to rename this as JUST A GUITAR, NOTHING ELSE, and take the picture of the black guitar, amp, strap, cord, gig bag, and picks, out of the description. Amazon did give me a refund, minus $10.00 for some reason, and they did pay for return shiping. Hopefully I'll have better luck on a different product."
1,Danger! Not a Bass Guitar,"If you look at the picture you'll see six tuners of an electric guitar.The body of the guitar is made of BASSwood and that is probably where they got the idea that this is a bass guitar. The neck is of a slim design and is a little too narrow for my fat fingers.The guitar is solid and sounds good, all-in-all a good set but not what is advertised!As a guitar I'd give it a 4.5, the poor rating is that it is NOT a bass guitar!"
3,it's Okay,"This is not one of my favorite Comic View tapes. I didn't think this one was as funny as some of the others I have seen, but was ok."
1,A trite tale filled with cliches,"I read this book in 3, no 2 days out of complete boredeom. Its filled with cliché's, vapid poker terms, and that soft core porn type literature that you women call ""romance"" type stuff. Being in no way an ardent fan of gambling, I managed to read 97% of this book( but skiped the ending, maybe I'll read it tonight),...agian only out of complete bordem. *cough, I work in the senate, *cough. Let me tell you boy, it was tolerable.It was good when the whores died though."
4,Great book about a kid learning to be a poker shark.,"One of the best books I every read as a teenager. If you enjoy playing poker, and ever fantisized about tracking down the master of the game, to learn his skills, this is a very fun story."
4,"Enjoyable book, but not true dictionary","This book is an enjoyable read, with some phrases I have not found in other work phrase books (and I have about six such type books.) However, I think the title of the book has given this book and average rating among reviewers. Those expecting a comprehensive amount of word/phrase origins will be disappointed, but no fault of theirs, the book's title is misleading. The book's title should be something like ""Interesting Word and Phrase Origins"". It's also a little high-priced for what you get new, so definately get a used version."
2,"Handy, but I've seen much better","As a budding linguist (by hobby not vocation) it's kind of fun to be able to cross-reference with other dictionaries of word origins. But if you are of limited funds or just want a better source, I'd definitely suggest you give this a miss and go for something by Ayto or Oxford."
1,Disappointed,"Based upon the description provided for this ""comprehensive"" book, I expected an authoritative and informative reference book. In reality it is a bizarre hodgepodge of words and phrases. It may be entertaining but I don't consider it a comprehensive reference book."
4,How words and phrases become common useage,I've often wondered about the origins of some common words and phrases and the dictionary isn't sufficient for that purpose. The Morris volume that I purchased is right on target and a satisfactory source for most of our useage
5,A MUST HAVE BOOK!,"A great informational book. Knowing where all the expressions we say came from. It is so much fun to read and start using sayings that you have never used before, and watch peoples faces look at you funny. :)"
4,very good,"this book not only does a very good job of giving the origins of many common (And lots of uncommon) words and phrases, put does it in a very entertaining way. The author has a great sense of humor and it comes across through his explanations."
3,Origins of some sayings?,"Where does the saying, ""Dress to the nines"" come from? Also the saying, ""I'm on cloud nine? What is the origin behind these two sayings? Please respond at: angel_eyes74@hotmail.com"
1,Spend the extra $ for something else,"The subwoofer is nice, the speakers are not good, have already relaced mine with another brand, at the moment the receiver is not working, it cuts off after 5 minutes.I will probably have to have it repaired and I have had it 2 months, I am very unhappy with it."
4,Good computer graphics text,This text has a novel approach to entry level computer graphics using homogeneous coordinates entirely. I struggled a bit with the use of these representations in perspective transformations. However once I got it I found the derivations and formulas to be easy to get and easy to use. The book has an extensive set of exercises with complete answers. I deducted one star because the theoretical aspects of homogeneous transformations could use expansion and simplification.
5,Brilliant,"These interviews with 12 notable gay authors are powerful meditations on literary creativity and gay identity. The deeply insightful questions--Canning read everything by each of these authors before interviewing them--draw thoughtful, at times surprising responses from a wide range of authors. Readers are left to draw their own conclusions about the sum effect of the interviews, but one result for myself was fresh respect for these men and for their hardworking devotion to art. I am eager to read further volumes of Canning's interviews; it is such a pleasure to read intelligent commentary about novels by gay authors, when so much of what we get is filtered through annoying celebrity-obsessed, therapy-thirsty media like The Advocate and Out."
4,red cloud 6650,"Large pack for a extended hike, easy access to all areas of pack, good price for novice backpacker."
5,Backpack Europe!,"Love it, perfect size for 4 weeks in Europe and the fit is perfect for me (5'6"") I packed about 40 pounds in with miscellaneous weight and once I strapped on the hip part, it felt nice and light.PERFECT FOR BACKPACKING EUROPE!"
1,Died twice - now unrecoverable,"Maybe I was unlucky but within a few weeks the power kept crashing off so I would just restart it. Then, last week it crashed off and would not restart. Just 4 beeps every time and I could hear the hard drive turning bu no display. Customer support was helpful via on-line chat and eventually said I should mail it back to HP (it's under 1 year warranty). Fine, except that I bought in in the USA and now I'm in UK.Now, getting on for 3 years later, I found that there's a serious issue with overheating causing failure. This combination of video card and processor is known to fail - I cannot recommend these laptops at all.Almost 4 years after purchase: To anyone thinking of buying an HP product - beware! I have since found out that there is a manufacturing defect in the nvidia chip which HP knows about. Literally thousands of people have complained on an HP forum but due to the size (and cost) of the problem HP refuse to make a recall."
1,six time for repair ..two repair no longer under warrenty,"I had this notebook for 14 months and it had probelm from day one..the quick play button at one time stoped two times,the keybord needed replace,and the video card stoped working so now its off to the repair as of 04/23/08..this note book as been in repair 6 time..I tryed to get HP to replace with a new notebook but there not up to doing so.I dont recommend this notebook or any other product from HP.this is my first and last HP product"
5,Glen Campbell album,We couldn't be more pleased with the Glen Campbell dvd.we appreciated it that the recording was filled with favorite Campbell songs and not a lot of dialogue.
3,"Still a load of talent, but...","Glen Campbell is no longer thirtysomething. He has matured and some things have changed. His voice for one. On this disc it is much more nasal than when in his prime. He just doesn't sing as well as he used to. On the other hand, he is still a gifted guitar player and an enjoyable entertainer. I passed up seeing Glen live eralier this month and bought this disc instead. From the current level of his performances, as documented on this disc... This disc is not for those wanting to hear Mr. Campbell the way he sounded on his Goodtime Hour."
1,ASIAN IMPORT,"They very convienently left out the fact that this is an Asian import, if I had known that I never would have ordered it."
3,A competent performance from a great singer/performer.,"Glen Campbell has to be one of music's greatest crossover artists and this DVD is a great showcase of the many aspects of his prodigeous talent. From his brilliant guitar playing on such classics as ""Galveston"" and the very well done ""Classical Gas"" to his smooth delivery of great songs like ""Wichita Lineman"" and ""Rhinestone Cowboy"". Campbell is an entertainer all the way.It must be noted that Campbell's voice is no longer what it used to be. It has taken on a much greater nasal sound and he no longer hits the high notes or makes the crescendos but nonetheless his performance is very good considering his age. What he lacks in youthful delivery he makes up for with some great interpreting. A fantastic rendition of Linda Ronstadt's ""Still Within the Sound of My Voice"" and one of the best versions ever of ""MacArthur Park"" along with a lovely cover of ""Time in a Bottle"". These great songs along with many of his classics makes for enjoyable viewing."
5,A Perfect DVD for all Glen Campbell Fans,"Since purchasing this DVD I am reliving all my favorits songs by Glen Campbell. It is a must for all die hard Glen Campbell fans. I also bought the CD from this concert so I can listen to it in my car. Glen still looks great considering all the hardships he has gone through. I have found that I like his new renditions of some of his classics better than the original record. My favorite is ""Wichita Lineman"". He does an outstanding job on ""MaCarthur Park"" and I have fallen in love with the song ""Still Within The Sound of my Voice"". I have played this DVD over and over again and will continue to do so until I wear it out!!! I hope to see Glen perform live for the first time this coming Sept. in Bowling Green, Kentucky and listen to him sing all his great hits."
5,Glen Campbell DVD,Excellent DVD and the special features were a very good bonus. Enjoying playing it over and over during the weeks since I received it.
1,Did not care for this one,This steering wheel cover has a terrible chemical smell i had to remove it from my steering wheel. It now sits in my trunk.
1,Steering wheel,Smells bad not very good. and is to big for steering wheel. needs improvment do not buy this item at all
3,Not Impressed,"Nice and soft steering wheel cover, but the seems are low-quality. After a little time it will start to tear and fall apart. Over all I would buy a different one."
3,"Feels great, but small","Ok. It feels great. I just bought this (winter time) so that I don't have to hold the ice-cold steering wheel anymore.It's REALLY hard to put this on. I tried to heat it up with my heater to make it softer so that I can stretch better to put it on.In the end, it was torn for about 0.5"" while I was trying to put it on. Make sure your steering wheel is a correct size. I have toyota camry 98."
4,Better than I expected,This steering wheel cover feels so cushy and soft. You will love it.It covers most of the steering wheel and allows me to grip more easily while driving. I recommend this one.
3,It's okay,"Received this item - went on easy - however once on the steering wheel, the cover was just a little too squishy for my taste. Made the steering wheel feel very ""fat"" and annoying to hold.So while the construction was okay - would recommend looking for one at a auto parts store so one can get the feel of it before purchase."
2,"""snug fit""","Measure your steering wheel before you buy this product. It is said to fit up to 15.5"" diameter, but that is not true. My wheel is 15.5"" and I spent a very long time with more than one person trying to fit it on my wheel. It never fit. I think it would even be hard to get on a 15"" wheel. It is made well and the insulation would probably work, but they need to be more honest about the size of wheel it would fit. It seemed like my wheel would have to be at least an inch smaller."
1,This product contains lead (says warning on packaging)!!!,"When I opened the box that this steering wheel cover came in, I almost passed out from the awful smell that this product gives off. Also, the WARNING on the packaging reads: This product contains chemicals, including lead, known to the State of CA to cause cancer and/ or birth deffects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling this product.I will be returning this cover immediately, and definitely won't be giving this ""poisonous"" gift to the person I intended to ""gift"" it to. I will also be reporting this steering wheel cover to The Department of Consumer Protection."
1,Stinks to high heaven,This steering cover smelled up my whole apartment. I put it outside to air three weeks ago. It still stinks! I can't use it.
5,Great!,"There is absolutely no smell to this steering wheel, ive recieved others in the past that have stunk up my car, this one does not. It also has a super snug fit, mind you, it was extremely difficult to get on but totally worth it. i have no fear that im gunna turn the wheel and only be turning the cover unlike other steering wheel covers. all around superior product, would defenetely recommend."
1,Too small - had to return it,"This product does not fit a normal size steering wheel. I have had similar covers before, which always fit, even though they were difficult to get on. This one is IMPOSSIBLE. Nothing I tried worked, including heating it up in the dryer to make it stretch. I returned it. Better off buying one at Walmart where I've gotten them before."
1,"Doesn't fit VW Jetta steering wheel, also contains LEAD!","The product stinks. Literally. It gives off a toxic smell. And the product contains lead, which causes cancer. And on top of all that, it doesn't fit my 2006 VW Jetta steering wheel."
3,"It's OK, but...","I like the feel of it, and I like the way it wards off extreme heat and cold, but once you install it don't count on moving it to another vehicle. We got a new vehicle and of course wanted to take the cover to the new one. It tore at the seam as I was trying to remove it (gently, mind you). It was a warm day and it didn't appear to be strained when the seam ripped out- it just ripped with no warning. So, the cover is now in a landfill. For the lack of overall durability I have to give this a 3 star review. If it was more durable I would 5 star it because it's comfortable and it is as described.If you're going to install it on one car and never remove it, I say go for it."
2,didn't fit my steering wheel!,"I have an toyota SUV and this didn't fit the steering wheel (tried for over an hour!). In the steering wheel covers defense, it did seem to be made of nice quality material. It's not like I was trying to put it on a bus, it's just a smaller SUV! disappointed"
2,1 month before stiching broke,After using this product one month the stiching along the cloth/vinly seam failed and I now have about a 2 inch rip that shows the underlying foam. I see this rip only getting larger. If the rip was not there I would give the product 4 stars.
2,Disappointment from the start,"Caution: I ordered a GRAY colored cover, but instead received a silvery-white colored steering wheel cover which I was unable to use in my car's dark-gray to black interior. It looked awkward, so I had to give it away to a friend with a light-colored interior. My initial excitement was sapped by the discrepancy. Either it was a shipping color mistake OR this company is categorizing the light white-toned color as 'GRAY', which it is NOT. The one I received did not resemble the rich dark gray color that is shown above."
5,grip,"this steering wheel cover is extremely comfortable. I recommend it to all in search of a feeling of control, comfort and astetic pleasure."
1,Would have been great... if it fit.,"I bought this for my Dodge Ram with a 15.5 inch steering wheel. It says it is supposed to fit, but I struggled to get it on. The material finally ripped when i nearly had it on. It is on the steering wheel but the firm molding along the inner edge is ripped apart and the foam is exposed. I'm sure this would have worked great on a smaller steering wheel. I wouldn't buy this for a 15.5 inch wheel."
1,A poisonous steering wheel cover?,"Before you buy this, read the other 1-star reviews. I bought this cover, saw the warning label, and sent it right back for a full refund. How could anyone think importing a poisonous steering wheel cover was a good idea? This is one steering wheel cover you shouldn't touch... Literally!"
3,size matters,"Well this steering wheel cover was too large for every vehicle I own. I am disappointed but didn't want to take the time to send it back, so I kept it and will eventually gift it out. LOL"
3,ergo grip steering wheel cover,The wheel cover is a catch 22. If youhave arthritic hands you can't get it on.A daughter and son in law did it for me.Thepadding needs to be somewhat firmer so you hands don't go right down to the steering wheel.which is too hard.
2,Stinky,"Wheel cover is hard to put on the steering wheel, it took me and my father law about 10 minutes of pure brute strength to get it on. The smell is horrible. Every time I touch it my hands smell. I thought it would eventually fade with time but is hasn't. I have now had the cover for 3 months and the smell is as bad as day one. I would not wish this wheel cover on my worse enemy."
4,Give It Another Go!!!,"This game franchise died faster than my appetite after seeing a salad bar, and I think that's unfair! This particular series deserves another title to be squeezed out! One last hurrah! Please Interplay! Hear my plea!!!"
5,Message from the Author -- The Mike Ruppert,"Regarding the review from the_mirror.I have never considered either Timothy McVeigh or Terry Nichols to be American heroes. Pawns, patsies and not very bright, yes; Heroes, never. Further, like many who are moderately familiar with the OKC bombing, I have serious doubts as to the government's version of events there and I also seriously doubt that a truck bomb caused all that damage based upon hard science.Neither do I advocate or even remotely endorse any form of violence against the government, especially a cowardly attack against innocent women and children. I never have.These convenient attempts to discredit me and Rubicon with associations we have never been a part of are transparent efforts that have been easily recognized by Amazon reviewers thus far.I am, however, humbled and personally gratified by the reviews I have seen. They prove that people are getting it!Michael C. RuppertAuthor""Crossing the Rubicon"""
4,911 detective story,Approaching the 911 occurrance as a murder investigator the evidence obtained and the background information can lead one to conclusions that have been ignored by the so-called watchdog press at our own peril. Very interesting and easy to follow and very disturbing in its conclusions and implications.
5,eye-opening,"great book, connects a lot of dots. i have spoken to people from some of the countries discussed and they say similar things about the regions they are from (talk to a serb about kosovo). there is a lot that people are unaware of, mainly that the cia is a paramilitary like any other, and that they do what every other paramilitary does (organized crime)."
2,Uh...there's no peak oil,"Just go to youtube and type in ""Myth the world is running out of oil"" It's a news report with John Stossel. There's enough oilsands, just in Alberta Canada to fuel the earth's popualation needs for over 100 years. There's also vast amounts of oil...whether in oil shale or untapped oil fields, in the USA. Much of it is not allowed to be recovered because of unreasonable environmental laws. But the point is, there's lots and lots ( a century or more ) or recoverable oil still in the earth ( and that's just what we currently know of ) . Peak oil is false. It's just common sense."
3,One wonders if this book presents facts why it was allowed...,"to be published let alone why the author hasn't mysteriously disappeared as yet? Could it be Ruppert is an agent of disinformation?Yes, this book does present disturbing revelations and yes, these revelations are documented, how accurately I cannot say as I did not delve into all the citations listed. But given the mysterious murders documented within its pages, I again pose the question why Ruppert and FTW haven't, at best, been closed down and, at worst, why Ruppert hasn't been, what's the word, liquidated?My own opinion is that nothing GWB and co. suprises me, but the conspiracy theorist undertones of this book do lead to some credibility problems."
3,Take a closer look at the author,I myself tend towards the theory that 911 was an inside job. But I would encourage sincere researchers to read the following information concerning Micheal Ruppert:http://69.28.73.17/ruppertwingtv.html
2,Paranoid,"Author states the obvious - USA very powerful, controlled by our most powerful citizens, they fight to maintain our wealth and dominance, many suffer from a lack of ethics, and the fight over a precious resource (oil) remains a main source of conflict. Author ignores the ingenuity, optimism, and resolve of the American people to consistently do what is right and necessary. We will get rid of bad leaders, solve the oil crisis with new technologies, and continue to lead."
1,Fake Reviews,"Strangely enough, all the 5 star reviews of this book were written in the same style of writing by people who have not reviewed anything else on Amazon.Draw your own conclusions..."
