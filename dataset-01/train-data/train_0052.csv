5,Best book of the series...so far.,"The one-line summary says it all. I hear so many people complaining about how the series goes on and on and on...okay, I might get some comments about this, but I enjoy them...it's a SERIES. Which means, it'll run until the author runs out of ideas. If you hate the fact that it's going on and on, why continue to buy these books? Personally, I enjoy them...yes, it's all a matter of opinion, but use some common sense when you right these comments, people. If you like the series, you'll love this book. If you just want the series to end now, you won't."
5,Makes 50% of the population seem a bit stupid,"I think the book was wonderfully written, but he takes a long time to get to a point. Also, he likes to make all men act a bit stupid and make women archangels, which really gets my goat. It's kind of insulting."
4,Insanity.,This is another of Jordan's greatest works. He describes his characters well once again. However the plot of the book gets so intertwined I believe this was one way to work out some of it.. which made most of it slow reading. Once again the end fight scene is awsome. However the one part of the book I really liked was the return of Lan... How can you not like someone married to death? :)
3,arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggh,"I picked up ETW with a book voucher little knowing what I was letting myself in for! Being something of a speedreader, (and naving too much time on my hands) I read the first 6 books in 4 weeks! Unfortunately by the time I got to LoC I was so strung out I could barely get thru' it. Either that or I'm getting sick of the women in the series! One way or another I'm sticking with it , 8 books or 9, whatever, I mean to see it out if only to find out what happens to Mat!!"
3,Wait until the entire series is out-then read it.,"I foolishly finished Lord of Chaos while it was still new to paperback and liked it. Although of course, I think that the length of Jordan's series is appalling, it is still very well written. He has the potential to make a masterful series that doesn't drag for eighty years. One reader said he was going to set himself of fire if Jordan didn't finish. Honestly I don't know how the author walks the streets safely anymore after pulling off such a maddening series. Anyway, if you're reading Lord of Chaos now, slow down and wait until Jordan finishes the series. If you don't, you may end up like me,waiting and waiting and waiting for the next book and then losing interest and facts from the previous novels. Then of course there are no little synopses that can remind you of what you've forgotten. Oh Well...Jordan's series was great, but he's lost sight of what it means to write a truly great fantasy series."
1,Too many directions,"The book is unreadable for someone unfamiliar with the series. Even in an intricate series each books need to have the ability to stand alone, this one does not. It's like reading a never ending soap opera, of the daytime variety."
3,The Good News...Then The Bad News,"In one word: Incredible.In another: Long.Robert Jordan has created an awesome and deadly world,beseiged by the powers of darkness and brought us heroes never the likes of which you will not likely see again. Unless of course Eddings re-writes the Mallorean series. But that's a different review all together.This series of books has had me anxious to get home at night so i could sit down and read. It has had me staying up until all hours of the morning. If that is the case you may be wondering why i gave it such a mediocre number rating. I did because it's looooong. Way too long. At this point it seems to me that Jordan is grasping at straws, milking his readers for as much money as he can get. The situations he deals with in this book could easily have been solved two, maybe three books ago. And it looks like we're in for an even longer ride yet. If Jordan wasn't such a damn good writer, I would have given up on this series after book Three"
2,A real page turner. I hope I live to read the final book .,"This book answers a few questions and begins to set the major players in place for the final battle. There is: a new Amerline seat, the three Women will share the Dragon Reborn are named. Elanine, Matt, Nynaeve search for a magic item in a city where looks can get you killed"
4,Aes Sedai,The book lord of chaos was one of the best books I have read from The Wheel Of Time series.The book was both exciting at times at boring but you always kept reading because Robert Jordan has a trick of cutting off the chapter at the best part and going to one of the other characters. These may seem irritating to you but acctally it keeps you reading to find out what happens. I have to say that my favorite part is when Rand is bonded by a Aes Sedai and rand goes crazy sheliding her and almost killed here after she left she started talking about how strong he is and that she was just a twig compared to him. To understand this you have to relize that Aes Sedai never act like that they are always calm and expressionless a Aes Sedai loseing here calm means that something really huge is going on.
1,wouldn't trade with again,"The book is not at all as described (good condition). The binding is torn, pages damaged, and no dust cover."
2,Question for the Author...,"Why in the name of the Creator did Rand allow Alanna to LIVE after bonding him by ambush, against his will like that? I mean, I would have at the very least tied off the flow that cut her off from the True Source permanently!"
5,"Brilliant, my faith is restored!","After the extremely dissapointing Fires of Heaven, where the characters spent 900 pages walking in the desert, only to end up repeating the ending from one or two of of the earlier books, this volume (Lord of Chaos) was so much better, in fact, one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. So many unexpected developments, both in plot and character, it was brilliant.Unlike FoH, LoC actually kept me turning the pages since I wanted to see what was going to happen next. And the ending was great too, for once it didn't end with Rand killing one of the Forsaken.The only thing I was dissapointed with was not with the actual book itself, but rather the magazine review from Locus Magazine, which gave away what was going to happen at the ending! So if you want to avoid knowing the ending, don't read any of the magazine extracts!"
5,Love the series!,Such a loss that Robert Jordan was taken before the ultimate completion of his life's work.The characters are well developed and the story is always well constructed.
5,Impressed by this book and the series overall,I thought the books would have to get less interesting as the series progressed but I have to say I've enjoyed every single book in the series to date. Definitely recommend.
2,Never ending,"I acutally spoke to Robert Jordan at a book signing at the time this book came out. At that point I asked him:""how many books there were going to be in the series?"" 7 to 9 he says, not quite sure yet.""about the plot - do you have it worked out?"" Making it up as I go.My heart sank when I got these answers and it probably explains why the series has got so bad from this point onwards. I stopped reading this series when I heard these answers, because I knew it wasn't going to end up well plotted out and was just drifting on and on.This may explain a few mysteries as to why this series has declined in quality so badly. He's got 2 stars because the books were still readable at this time - but there was/is no end in sight still."
4,Great book! Some character errors.,"Overall, Lord of Chaos is an incredible book. There is a ton of plot action and some new completely unexpected twists. Too bad the females are so BITCHY. Nynaeve needs to ""disappear"". Faile, Egwene, and Elayne need to as well. You would think that they would like the guys...Anyway, great book!"
1,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The book has some good stuff, but the majority is rand going back and forth. I'm pretty far, but it will take a lot of will-power to get myself to finish the book."
3,boring,"only reason i read it was cuz i love the books. after this book, they just go on and on and on. however, the ninth book, winters heart is very good (you need to read them all to understand it all). this one was kindof nothing special. it was very sad when moirane died. should read it, but only if uve got a lot of spare time"
1,"Great book, wrong Cover","This is a great book (5 star content), however, the kindle edition does not have the new redesigned cover (reason for 1 star rating). I really hope this gets fixed soon. The new covers are the only reason I am purchasing these books on the kindle. All the other WOT books I have purchased for the Kindle have the nice redesigned cover. If you want to know what the cover should look like (from the Tor Website): [...]"
5,READ THIS BOOK NNNOOOWWW,"This book is GOOD. Very, very GOD. It's the best book in Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time, for which I offer my heartfelt recommendation. The end is quite possibly the best conclusion to any book in the HISTORY OF MANKIND. It's rivaled only by the end to the most recent inclusion to The Wheel of Time, Winters Heart. All in all, I would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are in general a fantasy fan or not. So far I've found one person who didn't like this series, and I didn't like him anyway. Jordan's manages to verbally illustrate a spectacular world which is sure to entrance the person fortunate enough to read it. I've read the series three times, which is both sad and miserable, I know, but the main point of this ceaseless rambling remains; READ THIS BOOK."
3,"In Randland, men are from Mars, women are from Venus...","Level-headed people are from the planet Earth. Men! They're so arrogant! Always thinking with their hormones! Women! One can never be sure as to what they're thinking! Better to deal with a gholam on LSD!! Although this almost overshadows the real story most of the time, Rand's quest is still paramount and compelling! Jordan is as great or greater than Tolkien, as great or greater than Shakespeare...yeah, right!! People who say things like that do not know what they are talking about! Period. Through the end of this book, the series is about 5,500+ paperback pages! One needs patience and a lot of it to get through these volumes, but it is definitely worth it!"
3,Lord of Chaos,"The speed with which I received the books was definitely 5 star (I ordered books 5, 6, and 7). But I ordered the larger size of the paperbacks and received the smaller size. If the larger size is no longer available then it shouldn't be an option. This is the second time this has happened. The other time was with another vendor."
4,Very Addicting,This series is very addicting. It is easy to get lost in the characters and world. I love it!
2,An Ok Book With One of the Best Endings,This book is ok. It's long and drawn out and doesn't get very far into the story but the ending makes up for a good deal of it. There are also more main characters for you to keep up with so remeber names. Yes it is neccasary to read for Wheel of Time fans.
2,Stop reading series after book 3,"This series stopped being good after book 3. Jordan is really stretching this series out. The action is severely slowing. There charcters are becoming cookie cutter an uninteresting. Jordan is wasting about half of the book on regurgitating things you have read before and the other 50% is wasted in overly detailed descriptions of what characters look like, clothing items, and how they they see another character.Jordan dropped the ball on this series and it should have ended in 3 books."
2,Yawn....,"....when I had trouble sleeping at night...all I had to do was pick this book up and I'd be passed out within 15 minutes. I've read the first six books of this series, and this one by far, was the most difficult to get into and finish. The only character who seemed to grow and mature was Egwene. Perhaps it is time for me to go to another author/series...any suggestions?"
3,nothing happens,"The 6th book in the WoT series is the least interesting so far. All those pages to say almost nothing at all, there were maybe two or three interesting developments but it surely lacks the standard and intensity of the earlier books. Some things are really annoying; the extremely stereotype relationships between men and women, the neverending descriptions of what people are wearing etc.It will be a long time before I pick up book number 7"
3,Make it stop!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning of this series and read at least two more books before I realized this is a rather lengthy work with no resolution in sight. My suspicions were confirmed when I met the author at a book signing in Virginia and he told me they were considering ten to twelve books in the series. And they are not small tomes by any means!Any good story writer knows that a plot needs an end. While Robert Jordan is an excellent story teller, I wonder if he knows how to resolve all the conflicts in a tale. If so, this must simply be a money-making thing for him, not a legitimate literary pursuit."
3,"Its not a matter of ""if,"" but rather ""how""","Robert Jordan has sapped all suspense in his series by over-using prophecies. We all know Rand is going to fight the dark one and ""lose his blood at Shayol Ghul."" And, to put it bluntly, if Rand and crew do not win the last battle, the entire series would be a big waste of time. Thats not to say that I don't enjoy reading The Wheel of Time. Quite the contrary; in fact, its hard to not get excited when you pick up a brand new WoT book. I'm just pointing out that Mr. Jordan has used prophecies as a huge crutch in the plot. Why does Rand go out of his way to take Callandor? Propechy. Why does anybody even support him and not just gentle him on sight? Prophecy. Prophecy this, prophecy that.In my honest opinion, the only reason to continue reading this series is to find out how exactly things will happen, not whether or with whom."
2,Why read a book that does not move the plot along?,"I have been very pleased with this series up until this point. The plot has moved well, and all of the characters have been interesting.After the sixth book I expected to see a little closure on some of the issues facing Rand and other characters in this series, but instead I find that the plot of the story has only moved an inch, out of the mile that it still has to go and the mile that it has already gone. How can you, an author, expect to retain readers when you do not continue a story's plot? The only thing this book did was relocate the characters. The personalities stayed the same, and all of the problems that were there at the beginning of the book are still there at the end.Needless to say, I will never buy another book in this series again, since this one was frustrating and a waste of time..."
3,Being his seventh book I would expect more,Jordan started off this series with a bang. Now it seems like he is slowing everything down. Everything seems to be a repeat. Rand never seems to be very forward on what his plans are. This book started to really confuse me on where Jordan was going with this series.
5,Part of an on-going series,Very interesting series. Must be read from the beginning to keep all the characters straight. Have been reading the books for years as I wait for the paperback to come out.
5,The best so far,Quite simply i think this is the best book so far just for the fantastic ending which lets just say WOW.how anyone who can write a book like this and then have the next two books to be so poor is beyond me at least book 9 it does start to get interesting again.Am i alone in wanting the forsaken to be more powerful though they are suppose to be the best there ever was.
5,this is the right way to pull thing,"This is nice to have, so you can pull the other trailers also,and hook up the brakes too and be mounted up also, and a price I could not pass up, I had bought one before this one and took it back to Wal-mart...saved me over ten dollars"
4,Missing info,"Comes with mounting bracket, I ordered separately because it didn't say it came with it. Great deal but didnt need to buy bracket. $15 less than the local RV store."
1,Missing the white/ground wire to the 4 flat connectors,I bought one that turned out to be Missing the white/ground wire to the 4 flat connectors.[...]Be sure to check your connector before purchasing. I called 2 different store and the connectors they had in stock were the same as mine. Not as they shopuld be or as shown on Hopkins' websiteI rated one star. I would rate it 5 stars if it was properly made.
3,forest garden,"A lot of very useful info buried in fluff and redundancy. A lot of paper went into these books. Could have saved some trees and made them one volume instead of two. There are some invaluable charts at the back of the second volume. I would recommend these books, but brace yourself for some unnecessary wordiness."
2,boring and not very practical,"I bought the two books, despite the price because everyone talked about them. After a year or so I'm still not through. The writing is incredibly theoretic and boring. There are endless sections on how ecosystems work, but written in a textbook style manner you actually fall asleep.It is not a handbook either were you could look things up, real hands on information is very little.There are some useful tables in the end but most are only useful for those in the US.I really regret having spent that much money on this book. I should have bought Mollisons design manual instead, at least there's some information to be found."
4,A very nice debut novel...,"Honor's Destiny by Yolonda Greggs is a delightful read.Honor McIntyre is retiring from modeling after a couple of successful years in the business. Honor has both personal and family concerns which require her full attention.Nicolas Morgan has avoided dating any of the models working in the firm for which he serves as advertising exec. He has been drawn to Honor since the day she begin working for his firm, however. Now that she is entering retirement, the desire to pursue her quickly resurfaces. Nicolas, too, has family-related crises that need his attention. When Honor comes to his rescue on one account, the attraction between them can simply no longer be ignored.Honor's Destiny is a relatively short story at just over 200 pages, but a wonderful debut! Nicolas and Honor are a pair of wounded souls who must explore whether they can move forward together. Though the ending felt rushed, I look forward to Ms. Greggs' next novel due in late 2005."
5,Stunning!,"I love Kundera's books. I make no apolgies on that point. While they are not the type of books that I would categorize as ""leisure reading"", his works are absolutely captivating. K shows off his erudition as he takes us on a stroll thru 20th century postmodernism. It is difficult to categorize this book....and perhaps that's the point. His remarks on music, love and poetry are trenchant and evocative. I would highly recommend that every educated and cultured person should read MK. Just bring a sense of wonder and your imagination......let Mr. Kundera do the rest!"
3,Complex and difficult read; good discussion,I read this for a book group. We all arrived for the meeting talking about how frustrating the read had been. We were then most pleasantly surprised that this book generated one of our best discussions in months. It's a meaty read.
1,Disappointed,I had no expectations about this book and after reading it felt the author was misogynistic and self-indulgent.Would not recommend.
5,Kundera tiptoes on the border,"I slowed down towards the last 30 pages or so because the book has added new thoughts into my everyday life, and piece together and make sense of old thoughts. It amazes me that the english language can be written this way through a translator of originally czech text. The book is an incredible work. I highly recommend it, although you could probably pick up a used one at a local bookstore instead of buying it at amazon."
4,Strange and wonderful,"The only other book I've read of his is The Unbearable Lightness of Being, which is one of my favorite books, and I've read other Czech authors as well, which I've always enjoyed. The Book of Laughter and Forgetting seems more like a collection of short stories than a novel, though with connecting themes familiar to Kundera's work: Prague in 1968, exile, sex, love, death, art and politics. This book uses much more symbolism than Unbearable Lightness, even venturing in magical realism at times. It is also much more 'intellectual' in the French sense than Unbearable Lightness. A good book, and worth the read, but I prefer more actual storytelling than this book provides."
3,I think it must have been good.,"I read this a couple of years ago and remember being very fond of it. As i write this review, i'm looking at the book sitting on my bookshelf but it occurs to me that i have almost no memory of what it was about. I think that's funny for some reason."
2,Strange,"This was my first book by Kundera. I didn't understand it very much to tell you the truth, although I learnt that Milan has a pathologic fixation about the Soviet Invasion to the Czech Republic (to which he refers in every story of the book)."
5,Excellent,"Tremendous book of themes and ideas. Kundera leaves one's head spinning with his virtuosity. Plot takes a backseat to theme in The Book of L & F. Kundera is expanding the range of the common notion of the novel: he combines fragments, scenes, ideas, dreams, fantasies, facts, history, autobiography, and stories. It works. His analogies are wonderful and clear and personally relevant. I'll return time and again to reread passages about ""litost."" This acclamation is not to mislead one from the fact that Kundera can be a test, but the rewards are worth its taking."
4,always remember the first time,"I had a modernist/post-modernist class in college and we read this and I enjoyed it very much. It was a bit of a break from some of the difficult novels we were reading. Kept the book for years and recently re-read and got through half of it. For me it is a book best experienced when you are young. All the impressions, ideas, romantic/sexual stuff seems to have the depth of someone around college age. No longer young I was bored, but four stars for my remembrance of college pursuits."
5,Some of the most beautiful writing I have ever encountered,"I recommend this book. This author is so extremely and unnaturally talented that the sentences are only clothing for the story itself, which is about life in a way that is so subjective and objective. I explored myself when reading this book! I had many pregnant pauses to digest and internalize tiny pearls of wisdom strewn all over the beautifully written prose.I recommend ""the unbearable lightness of being"" by the same author as well.Milan Kundera has done a splendid and inspiring job."
3,Raw and thought provoking,"Kundera's raw, honest, eclectic style and satiric humor captures life in its nudity. His writing is most complex at its simplest and tragic at its funniest. It mocks and embraces the angst ridden characters in their repudiation and profession of intellectualism as it exposes the similarity in seemingly contradictory things. The novel escapes all known formats to frolic with criticism, music, art, sex and politics, randomly throwing scraps of insights, memories and lies. He takes the gloom out of existentialism carrying Camus and Sartre to new heights. Refreshing and offensive! - V. Roy"
5,A Truly Great Book,"This work by Franco-Czech writer (not a combination one sees everyday) is best if read quickly before or after his other great work, The Unbearable Lightness of Being. All of Kundera's works take a post-modern approach to the novel's themes and style, liberally sprinkling philosophical and metaphysical questions throughout the text; this one is no exception. It's constant and enduring image is that of the Circle Dance, as shown on the cover, and its power to allow the human spirit to rise into the clouds. The classical opinion of what a novel should be must be abandoned, or at least silenced, in order to thoroughly enjoy this work, but it makes any trouble well worth it. HIghest recommendation."
5,Great Jeans!,I love these jeans! They are my new favorites. They are true to size and just the right length!
3,Good acting but oh so slow,"I realize my review is not a glowing one but I found this movie's pace to be too slow. On the other hand, I found the acting to be quite competent. Too bad the pace of the story and some of the dialogue was stultifying."
4,Real Wheels Adventures,"We got this for my son at 2 1/2 and he is now 3 1/2 and still LOVES it. Real Wheels are educational, humourous, and ""clean."" While I think they are silly, the kids seem to love them!"
5,movies for children,My younger son always loved these movies with Dave. Used to be titled There goes a... I am converting all old VHS movies to DVD. Never know when I will need them again. Love them.
5,"""Dave"" video series","My son LOVES all these videos! I think the guy ""Dave"" is a little corny but he does do an amazing job showing kids all the trucks, etc. Very recommended- my daughter watches them also."
5,Best vedio for kids,"My son (4.5 yr) really love Real Wheel series. We already have some of the series in tape. But my son love them so much, we decide to buy the whole set in DVD. After receiving the DVD, my son still watched at least 3 times of each vedio. Highly recommend if you have a boy from 3 to 5 yr old."
1,These are the worst ever!,I have been greatly dissppointed by the whole series. I ordered three DVDs at once and am stuck with them. They don't hold my son's attention at all which is fine with me because Dave and Becky are so annoying anyway I couldn't stand it if he could. Way better choice would be the Fred Levine series or the I Love CAT Machines series. Don't waste your money on these.
4,elegant-anza,"This bar tape is super nice. it took me a while to wrap, i was probably too meticulous, but it looks great. The Yellow will get dirty, but you can clean it with soap and water."
2,Most Difficult to Install,"I agree with the previous reviewer, although this tape looks great once applied, it's a bear to wrap any surface with a curve to it. It wants to bulge and pucker. If you're not experienced with installing handlebar tape, try another product first."
1,Confusing and Disorganized,"I found this book to be confusing and disorganized as a reference guide. Please just give us the syntax, samples and any helpful shortcuts and a useful index!"
3,Too long for a quick start,"As a beginner to PLSQL, I have to read through a lot of material to find the things that I want to know. This book seems to be for intermediate programmers. But then it would be nice if some material could be dropped to get to the point. Too much time consumed reading unnecessary material."
1,More advice than PL/SQL Programming,"When looking for a solution to practical real life programming problems,I find it hard to find a solution or an answer in this book. The focus is by far to much on style and how the author would do it rather than to offer relevant working examples relating to the real world, contradicting the title of the book. I got a lot of paper for my money, but that's about it."
4,Oracle PL/SQL is a great introduction for novices,"I was introducted to this book as a student at DeVry Institute of Technology located in Dallas, TX. While this book is not adequate for those with no knowledge of relational database methodology of SQL experience, it is a great reference and tutorial for those who have prior knowledge of basic SQL. The book provides many examples of coding, along with guides illustrating debugging techniques. For those interested in SQL or an introduction into relational databases, I suggest both the Modern Database Management book (ISBN: 0-8053-6054-9) and the LAN Times Guide to SQL book (ISBN: 0-07-882026-X)."
1,Too much speech! Too many inaccuracies,"Why so much empty speech and ""humour / esprit à deux sous""? Mister Feuerstein is apparently not so sure about the meaning of a constant. The code examples can be confusing. I had the impression that selling that what is intended to be humor is more important than clarifying the pl/sql features. Mister Feuerstein knows probably a lot about pl/sql, but not necessarily about software engineering. In short: It was not necessary to waste so many trees for the meager content of the book.MarcoMathematician / Computer Scientist"
5,There simply isn't a better book on this topic,"No matter how long you already work with PL/SQL, (and with the Web it gets a new importance) I bet you will get to know the ""even better"" - techniques. And for topics one hasn't implemented yet I consider the ""teaching approach"" excellent; which for me means: equally good for a beginner as for the experienced. I'm in since 10 years and - in combination with the same authors book ""Programming in Packages"" - I got much more than I expected. Thats why I blindly ordered the authors new book ""Oracle Built-in Packages"" coming around May 98. I'm looking forward to new ways ""of doing it""."
1,This book is complicate and ugly,"This book starts with ""What is PL/SQL?"". But through the following 900 pages, I could not find a simple example showing how to test run a simple PL/SQL code or procedure through Oracle sqlplus or other Oracle calling interface, such as OCI and Proc. Well, my rating above might be biased. I made a career change from physics to become a professional C/C++ programmer by reading K&R's C Programming Language to begin with. However, I do not feel reading this book alone can get me anywhere but waste all my time. If five stars for K&R's, one star is all for this book. It's a matter of Simple and Beautiful vs Complicate and Ugly."
5,"If you're doing PL/SQL, this is THE book to have.","I have to admit that I haven't read the whole book yet. In fact, I've only read the first four chapters. But I'm so impressed with the first four chapters that I figure I've already got my money's worth. I like to read a book cover to cover, every word. Many computer books are written in such a dry, choppy style that this is impossible. This book is a pleasure. I enjoy the humor, the real-life anecdotes and, of course, there's lots of technical stuff. What I like most about the book are the coding standards and ""best practices"" that appear throughout the book (well, at least the first four chapters). Most of the technical content of this book is contained in the Oracle on-line books--but without this extra insight and commentary the technical details just don't mean much. This book answers the ""how do I use this?"" and ""why do I care?"" questions. If you're doing PL/SQL, this is THE book to have."
2,Not a book for beginners,"A few weeks ago, I decided to learn PL/SQL. I browsed the Amazon site to look for a good book for beginners. I picked this book based on the good review by the other readers. At the time, I did not know those reviewers, most likely had some experience with PL/SQL before they bought this book. After reading this book half way, I definetly rate this book highly if I have experience in PL/SQL. This book would be a good one for beginners if the author rearranges the order to the chapters. Right from the start, the author uses function, package and procedure to illustrate some of his points. Unfortunately, he does not introduce these 3 topics until later in the book. Poor me!! I did not have a easy time. I do not blame the author because he never claims that this book is intended for beginners."
1,Not a reference book,This book is useless as reference it doesnt fully describe basic functions like to_number. author waste pages on style which is useless to experienced programmers. waste of money
2,Oracle Pl/Sql Programming,"I ordered Oracle Pl/Sql Programming version 3 but they mailed meversion 2. This is a big B.S.,"
1,Good Movie; Bad DVD Audio,"I enjoy spaghetti westerns and the Terrence Hill ones are no exception. They are funny, light and entertaining. However, the DVD audio is horrible! As another reviewer had noted, there is a high pitch whistle which is constant throughout, regardless of what DVD player is used (Sony and Phillips). It is so shrill that it makes the video unwatchable. Painful! It would be better not sold than to be sold with such poor quality!"
3,Picture quality is blurry!,"If you're a Terence Hill fan, you'll put up with the picture quality, but I'd rather not. This video is a kick as are all his flicks we've seen so far. We're hooked enough to think about buying more Terence Hill from Amazon in spite of the poor quality."
3,"Good movie, Poor recording","As other reviewers noted, this looks and sounds like it was recorded on a hand-held camera in a theater. The movie lives up to the ""Trinity"" name and deserves a better treatment."
1,Trinity is still my name,this was the wrong video with the same title and was returned and I was reimbursed
5,I love the Hardy Boys book series,"I especially love reading them on the Kindle Fire, which makes reading so easy on my eyes. The series just keeps getting more exciting."
5,The Praise Band - Christian Music CD,"Highly recommended. This audio 2 CD set is loaded with the ""good stuff"". We especially like ""We Praise You for Your Glory"" and ""I Love Your Grace""."
1,Pearl Drop Earrings - Sardelli,The description for this earrings should say - Children's Jewelry. So tiny and I find the quality so poor. This must be made in either China or Thailand where most cheap jewelry nowadays come from. Will learn a lesson next time.
3,A Different and Uncommon Mathis,"One of the best Voice Stylists in the world, Mathis began in the 50s. After a golden era of great albums - many of them available here at Amazon - Mathis had no smash hit in the 70s except this 1978 duet album with Deniece Williams (what a voice!). Mathis seems out of his shore but it is a good album. A million sold out but ... I'd not recommend."
5,Great Novel,"I bought this book when it first came out in 2002 and I think I've read it at least ten times since then. When my husband was fighting in Iraq, for some reason I found so much comfort in reading and re-reading this story of love and friendship. For Love And Grace is a great novel from beginning to end. The story was so real that I felt like I knew many of the characters personally. I noticed that the author has another book coming out this year and I can hardly wait. This is a must read that I highly recommend."
4,Wonderful read,"I loved this book it had elements of drama, humour (the two mothers were funny but I felt there as a bit of overkill with those two it started to get annoying to read) and romance. Yes there is a fairy tale aspect to the story - the hero and heroine seem too perfect to be true- they have the perfect courtship with no drama whatsoever maybe cos Grace spent most of the time in a coma- lol. Anyway this is a good start to a lovely series. However an element of realism is there in regards to Derrick's response to his mother's death. It does makee one think this is where one's faith really is tested and how most of us probably would truly behave if we were in his shoes."
5,A Pleasant Surprise!,"This novel was passed along to me over the Thanksgiving holiday and although I'll be the first to say that I am not a romance reader, I found this one to be a pleasant surprise. I was told that it was romance, but I saw it more as a relationship book because there was a whole lot more than romance in here. When I was handed this book, my words were, ""If I don't like it, I'm sure gonna put it on Amazon."" Well, I really dug this book and since I was so ready to post a bad response to it, I thought it was only fair for me to pull my foot out of my mouth and post a good one. While the only Christian books I generally do are non-fiction, I had to take the time to to give this the props it deserves."
1,For Love and Grace,I enjoyed this book very much. It was one of the best romance novels I have read. Everythng just tied together so well. I would like to read the sequel. I know that is is going to be just as good as this one.
4,Fun Find for Daughter,My daughter loves Atomic Betty. So it was a nice surprise to find this. She enjoys her View Master & thought that this was pretty cool.
3,Not what I expected!,"Please don't get me wrong; the book itself is filled with lots of wonderful recipes but it was not as big as I had expected. I guess I just expected a larger book, but regardless it is worth ordering because every recipe I have made from it has turned out superb!!! Highly reccommend it!"
2,Not Mexicali Recipes,I was expecting the border town of Mexacali food. It is anything but. For the price it is more of a colorful small coffee table book. Not very many recipes. It should have a diffferent title.
1,What Battery Holder,"Wow, at least your can came with a battery holder. Mine didn't. Needless to say, the touchless can seldom worked as the batteries kept getting dislodged. What a disappointment."
1,live at leeds this is not,"So everyone hates your new band. Two albums sell 4 copies. What to do, what to do... Put out a live album!"
4,The Best Chemistry Book You'll Ever Encounter,"Beautiful book! Reads easily, great diagrams, and pretty pictures. Since Atkins is an excellent physical chemist, his chapters on physical chemistry are the best in the book."
2,Proactiv works better,"This product seems to work slightly, but Proactiv works much better on my face. Perhaps Proactiv doesn't work with you, which in that case you might want to try this, but you can get the same size bottles plus a free gift for only $20 with Proactiv. I spent $30, got the same size bottles and no free gift."
2,Not quite the Originals,"Beware, these songs sound a bit remixed, and are not the original sounding radio hit singles. Usually .89 cent songs are a red-flag."
2,So-so online reference,"It is a CD-ROM with an associated user's book that has a bare minimum of information.The CD-ROM is searchable and in HTML. It covers all the packages and classes of Java 2. It's style is very similiar to Java in a Nutshell. The search works by allowing you to type in the name of any class, method, or field. The CD-ROM will take you directly to the page covering that topic or give you a list of topics if there is more than one.This CD-ROM's major competitor is the Java Almanac. I prefer the almanac because it is paper.The CD-ROM has a nice browsing system, but given the fact that it does not have class/method descriptions, I think I will typically use the free HTML help that comes with JDK over this CD-ROM. The only time I envision using this CD-ROM is when I am working with a non-core API."
1,Disappointing results,"I bought this camera for a snorkeling trip in the Philippines. What a disappointment to find that none of the pictures we took with this camera -- above or under the water -- were even distinguishable. Fuzzy, blurry, and strangely...red. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this camera."
2,Bought for Mercedes,I thought these looked like decent rock guards. I'll probably give these away if anyone will even take them. I'll be buying something off the self from a department or auto parts store for less money that will be more durable.
4,THE FACTS,WHAT REALLY HAPPEND 331 PEOPLE DIED BUT NOW THEY ARE BEAING BROUGHT TO TRIAL THAT STARTED FEB 4 2002 ALL SHOULD BE KILLED
4,Ray Ban Sun glasses,"Hubby absolutely loved them, he's had this same model in the past but were too scratched so i got them for him in a different color.!!"
5,Ray Ban Sunglasses,"I absolutely love these sunglasses. These were a replacement for a pair I lost while swimming in a lake. The originals were actually a little too big. This is why I lost them. Ordering through Amazon, I was able to get a pair just like the originals that fit and at a better price. Can't beat that!"
1,Los lentes de una sola pieza se dañan,"Compre unos Ray Ban muy lindos el diseño era muy fashion, quedaban muy bién puestos pero después de dos años de uso se les empezo a caer el filtro solar a mis lentes de sol en la parte del frente y luego en la parte interna, cuando los lleve a la optica para ver que podiamos hacer con ellos la respuesta que me dieron es que no tienen arreglo, que los lentes de una sola pieza no tienen respaldo ni reemplazo y gaste $200 en unos Ray Ban que son para toda la vida y me duraron 2 años, increblemente mal y nadie responde por el daño ni siquiera la casa matriz, por eso no compren lentes de una sola pieza, salen muy malos..."
2,A one-dimensional insider's view.,"Pedantic repitition of technical details that can be found elsewhere. Not concerned with questions of practicality, and seldom willing to become critical. Can't recommend."
4,A good ATL book,"ATL is an interesting C++ framework to easily create COM classes. It uses extensively the C++ templates and is coupled with Visual C++ wizards to automate the writing of skeleton code of an ATL project. However there is not much documentation coming with VC++ on ATL and there are so much options in the wizards dialog windows that unless you know what you are doing, you will probably not do the right thing. This is where this book comes in.First, one of the coauthor, George Shepherd, is also the coauthor of the bookMFC Internals: Inside the Microsoft(c) Foundation Class Architecturethat I really liked. This book does a good job to guide you through the main ATL features. My only complain is that, like almost every other book on COM that I have read, it assumes that you know nothing about C++ and COM and takes the first 2 chapters to introduce you these topics and that represents almost 100 pages of prerequisite material that should have been found only in a introduction book IMO."
2,Confused look at ATL,"While I respect the authors as programmers since this book does contain some valuable information, they have no business writing books. This book spends all of its effort discussing how COM works and then how ATL was implemented and provides little insight on how to actually use ATL. After reading this book I was very discouraged from using ATL. Few things are adequately explained. I wonder who the target audience for this book is? It is certainly not ActiveX developers. The second half of the book is superior to the first half. Inside COM, by Rogerson, puts Inside ATL to shame."
2,Dissapointing,"This is a great book if you are already intimately familiar with COM. Their coverage of the Component Object Model is not too good. Also, coverage of building an ActiveX control container with ATL is very limited. Everyone covers building controls. Few books make connection points and events in ActiveX understandable."
2,You understand this book if u were already ATL expert,"I am a beginner to ATL and COM. I was excited first that there is a book on ATL from Microsoft Press. After going through this book, I am quite disappointed. The book has no direction, poor in building up the concepts. I feel the authors just opened the atl header files and started pouring all those details into different chapters. If a beginner is looking for a good ATL book, I don't think this book is the right one."
1,There are better books than this,"I was looking forward to this book for several months. It was supposed to be released originally Oct. '98, but the release date kept getting later and later. I really thought once it did come out it would be a good book. Boy was I wrong. I would recommend trying a different book if you want to learn or use ATL."
1,"For God sake, try something else",The lousiest book I have ever read. I happened to buy this just because its from Microsoft press. I bet there should be better books on ATL
4,Sean & Tilda,"Almost unbearable, but have to give it a 4 simply because of how beautiful Tilda looked and Sean Bean is, well, Sean Bean. They were visually stunning."
2,"I am very glad I rented this, rather than bought.","Maybe I'm a purist, but I was surprised to see a man in a tux in what was supposed 1600s Italy. Not to mention a pick up truck that looked like it was dragged straight from the junkyard and plunked down on set. All of that made for a very jarring viewing experience.The plot..Was there one? I realize this wasn't supposed to a literal biopic, but the writer could have at least tried for a story. It was all random scenes I couldn't follow. As for the love triangle, it all went by so fast I wasn't even aware of when it started and ended. There was very little dialogue.All in all, not something I'd recommend in the way of an actual biopic. It was interesting at times, but I still ended up left with a ""What the heck did I watch?"""
1,Horrid. Absolutely horrid.,This was hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm an art history major and I'm actually currently taking an entire class on Caravaggio. Nothing in this movie is based in fact at all. It's simply a gratuitous sex-fest. Jarman simply created a movie pushing his own sexual agenda using Caravaggio as his character. This movie has nothing to do with Caravaggio at all. Absolutely terrible. A disgusting waste of time.
3,Delivered quickly but book not helpful,I am at the end of my first year and I haven't found this book very helpful. Individual experiences may vary.
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased a set of Nology wires a while back. Worked great for about 2 months. more power, better gas milage, etc. then the capacitor in one of the wires went out. I don't know which wire, but one of the cylinders stopped working. I sent back all four wires to Nology for them to check out. They sent them back with the explanation that a metal connector was loose. I put the wires back on my car and they worked great,....for about two weeks. At a cost of $50 per wire I expected more. I have never had any spark plug wire fail except for Nology. You are better off trying Pulstar Pulse Plug. It has the capacitor in the plug itself. Nology wires look much ""cooler"", but I would rather have performance over looks. Would you rather look at a pretty lady or be with a pretty lady?"
1,Low quality of printer,Received the Canon Pxima mini260 on time from Amazon as usual! Open the box to check it out before wrapping it as a gift. I found the quality of the printer to be really cheap and there were all these warnings about how to put the ink cartridge in the printer and if not just right it could cause problems and even breakage. The ink cartridge is a multi purpose cartridge and it is so small that there is no way it could last for long without have to replace. I returned it to Amazon which refunded my mony and I purchased an Epson Photomate. The Epson works great and the quality of the prints are supper.
4,Good Pictures,"When I first got the printer I had some HP and Kodak 4x6 blank photo paper. I tried printing pictures and they looked bad (had streks, blury). I found out you have to use Canon paper. After I bought Canon paper the pictures look very good using pictures taken with a 4.0 mega-pixel Canon camera."
2,"Love the show, but...","My wife and I enjoy watching Gene Simmons Family Jewels and have watched every episode except for ""The Roast"". The claim on the case and everywhere else is The complete Season 3. That is false and very annoying. Leaving out the roast was the worst idea ever. Stating it is the complete season and then leaving out one of the best parts was quite annoying. Guess I'll have to resort to other methods to get future episodes."
4,cool,i am probably the biggest KISS fan ever so i like any thing KISS always have always will so i dont care if you like it or if you dont i love it actually its pretty funny sometimes
2,Another fake reality show,"This show is entertaining, but it annoys me that a show that is meant to be a reality show is fake. I didn't know how fake it was until I watched the episode ""Gene Down Under"". The entire episode involving Gene buying a football team is fake, none of that happened in real life.I wish this show was more reality than ""scripted reality""."
3,NOT FULL SUBTITLE,Not full subtitle. So need more subtitles because of many deaf people rather that full subtitle to make them more enjoy.
4,TRACKLISTING:,"There are 6 different versions on this single:1- Radio Version2- Boogiesoul Remix3- Simon Vegas Remix4- Album Instrumental5- Boogiesoul Remix Instrumental6- Simon Vegas Remix InstrumentalAll remixes clock in under 4 minutes. This may be a minus for club fans but for fans of pop music in a general sense, this is a plus as they don't have to wait for length intros and breaks to enjoy the song in it's different variations."
4,"An excellent, comprehensive guide to Hawaii","This book is outstanding! It goes far beyond the typical travel guide, covering such topics as the history, natural history, language, economy, and religion of Hawaii. Bisignani does not allow this to distract in any way from the purpose of the book, however. Quite the opposite; I used this book (almost exclusively) in planning an incredible--and incredibly diverse--trip to Hawaii. Everything from $20/night cabins in Volcanos National Park to $400+/night super-luxury resorts are covered in its many pages.A word of caution, though. If you are interested in a guide book to aid in finding a resort to escape to for your vacation, ""Hawaii Handbook"" may have too much information for you. Reading this book will allow and encourage travelers to get the most out of Hawaii's fantastically diverse offerings. You beach bums may discover that you are missing out on a great deal, and end up spending a lot less time sunning by the surf!"
2,Is this the same author?,"The first two books in the series are distinctly excellent and compelling science fiction. Not sure what happened here - this book is frustratingly aimless. Mr. Park's writing remains very good, but not good enough to make this nearly plotless book readable."
3,A good textbook for beginers.,"This book is a very good textbook for beginers, especially mathematicians or physicists with PDE backgroud. Unfortunately, PDE is not a cure-all. It may be cumbersome in many cases. Like most research papers by the same authors, it lacks diversity."
5,An astounding product from an astounding artist!!,"I have had the pleasure of seeing Deborah Henson-Conant perform in person many times, but nothing prepared me for the caliber of this endeavor!Everything - from the lush, dramatic lighting and unique, dynamic camera angles to the poignant, often heartbreakingly beautiful stories and exuberant theatrics - moved me. Almost to the point of tears even!!You think you know the harp - think again! I'll never look at the instrument the same way ever again - or any instrument for that matter.I recommend this DVD to anyone...EVERYONE! Not just for classical music lovers. This is a whole new genre!In case it's not clear from my gushing, I LOVE this DVD! Every single minute of it. And you will too!"
5,An Earthbound Angel with Fire,"Deborah Henson-Conant is amazing! A friend of mine introduced me to her music and I was entranced, I had to have copy of Invention & Alchemy for my own! Now I do thank you!"
2,The talking jazzist,"I was searching for a good harp player (jazz) and read a reccomendationon this DVD as a ""must have"" harp masterpiece.I bought this DVD with the hope to hear good jazz from the harp. Instead what I heard was a lot of talking from the player. If you like stories this is the DVD you want."
3,MCSE Readiness Review Administratering SQL Server 7.0,"Exam Questions are more complicated. The questions in this book are ""way too easy"" and are nothing like what is on the exam!"
2,Not terribly helpful . . .,"I knew this book inside and out, but I still failed the test. The practice exam questions in this book look NOTHING like the questions on the actual exam. I would not recommend this book if you are hoping to pass the SQL exam. However, it is a good starting point."
3,caution,The book helps with the design of the real test but I did not feel the content of the book nor the practice exams were sufficient for passing.
3,Good Info,"I have not taken the MSoft test yet, but I have found this book helpful. The book is broken down into sections and then discusses each objective with review questions. It comes with a interactive CD-ROM for testing with your PC. You can also purchase more test through the vendor. The book list several references for each objective."
3,Love Pain by #'s,I love the idea of the toy but I don't remember receiving it. If I did that it went as a gift and haven't heard from family regarding experience.
2,Kenneth Cole RUNS BIG,"Guys, i needed a pair of shoes for a wedding and had to buy'em quick. so i headed to amazon and purchased these. I've purchased several pairs of shoes before on this awesome site, but these were off by a way much. It seems to be that Kenneth Cole shoes run way bigger that you normal size. I'm a size 12 and these were defiantly not 12. they were at least 13 ! Also once i had them they dont look as much like the picture. AVOID."
4,These run big,"VERY nice shoe. These do seem to run about half of a size big, though. The brown pair has different shades of brown color (obviously intential) throughout the shoe. I like that they are not a solid color and I have had several compliments on them."
2,There are far better sources,"I had high hopes for this books since the Mass Eye and Ear atlas is so well done. This book, however, is not an easy read and I feel that the topics are not really consistent with board-type material. Also, the pictures are largely useless, with a ton of pathology pictures without clinical photos. I think Chern is far better organized and easier to follow."
4,Vital resource for OKAPS,"I didn't have the luxury of waiting for the newer version coming out this year since OKAPS is a bit earlier than it has been in the past.Pros:- Lots of useful tables with synthesis of material- Concise and useful summarization of major RCTs- Contains CD with images that could be used for Powerpoints.Cons:- Some inaccurate information- Has information scattered in different sections. (Why is there so much Retina in the Peds section?!)Overal:- Probably the best current ""First Aid"" equivalent to the BCSC / OKAPS."
3,Simple and okay,"This book is okay, but Margaret Wise Brown has done better, especially Goodnight Moon. I wouldn't put it on my list of must haves."
1,One of the least useful I've encountered!,"I find this set to be next to useless. The Italian on it is so very basic that it's an insult to anyone who has already made any effort at all to learn the language. For all its faults, I find the Michel Thomas set much more helpful - ditto for the Berlitz Intermediate Italian. I concur that the CD's have (even as ""brand new"" ones) places where the skipping / data flaws are terrible and there is too much dead air on them. Don't waste your money. There are better courses that don't insult your intelligence, and that also use Native speakers (if this is important to you)."
1,[...],"The theory behind it is excellent. However, [the quality is bad]. The CD tracks do not go forward or back... so you might have advanced to the next track, but when you stop the CD it goes back to the beginning of track 1. This is a course meant to be used ""behind the wheel"" of a car... how can you you safely drive a car as you are fast forwarding, which takes forever if you want to advance much beyond the first track. So really, you never get beyond the letters, or the first few words. Believe me, I ordered Berlitz and that is the way to go. Also, try a company called World of Reading Ltd."
1,I know how to count.,"I can only review three of the discs because the remainder were defective and had repeated areas of skipping. One of the ""good"" discs had 54 seconds of dead air space at the beginning of the disc. A good portion of the discs (too much actually) concentrates on counting. Many references are out of date and irrelevant (how you convert from Francs to Lira? who cares, - there are no more Francs or lira....) Mr. Frobose discusses a few examples of words that have similar roots and sounds in Italian and English as a way to accelerate the learning of many words. However after this brief mention, he never expands on this idea. If he had given the listener a bunch of these words, he may have hit on a theme for a set of discs that satisfy."
1,Avoid Like the Plaque,This course arrived with a xeroxed cover. The CD's looked like they were made by someone on their computer at home. The sound was scratchy and clicked often. A very sub-standard product.
1,"great for beginners, but very basic and outdated","A beginning crafter with little computer experience will probably really enjoy this book. It's got some great very beginning, easy projects.If you have any graphics and graphic software experience at all, this book will waste your time. It was written in 1998, which in Internet years is approaching the stone age. Sorry to bias the stats, but I'm a graphics professional and was looking for more like some of the new image tranfer technique books."
4,This is me,"Dream is a very good group. This is me is a great song. The CD also includes a remix. Also enhanced with the video. They were gonna come out with a new album and the got a new member named Kasey. Melissa expressed her desire to leave the group, in order to appear in the Nick Cannon movie ""Love don't cost a thing"", and to work on a solo record. But the group split up when they released their new single ""Crazy"" which is aparently not available on amazon.com or anywhere. But anyway, This is me is a great song. It's out of stock. But mak sure you buy it used or new."
1,Random Winds,"One would have to be a sadist to enjoy this novel full of bad relations, death from floods, war, etc. Disfunctional characters making poor judgements, etc."
1,Randomly Turns Detector On and Off,"I have the Whistler Pro78SE detector which is a great unit. The Whistler Intellecord is supposed to be compatible with my unit. The cord does what it's supposed to, but it randomly shuts the unit off and turns it back on. I don't have any problems when I use the power cord that came with my detector, only with the intellecord. If the Intellecord didn't do this it would be a useful thing to have."
4,Whistler Intellicord is it?,"I have the ""short"" press set to silence the unit. About 1/2 the time when I try to press it once to silence it it restarts the unit instead. OK, but not really impressed."
4,Should have more features...,"I bought this cord because I wanted a easier way to control my new Whistler Xtr-695SE while driving. I wanted an easier way to silence the alerts if needed. This cord helps you do just that. But I was hoping for more. I was hoping it would allow me to control the volume of the radar detector, allow you to control the menus or have coiled cord. But I am satisfied so far and it is customizable from the radar detectors menus. I would recommend this for the price (~$19)."
1,"Not worth the price, both of mine are defective",When I press the button it reboots both my detectors. I have two of these cords on 2 different detectors and it does the same thing on both of them. I even set both functions to auto mute and it still simply cycles the detector off then on when I press the button.
2,WhistlerIntellicord,"This product comes with a straight power cord vs. a coiled cord that I was expecting. Did not even open the item packaging, and have already returned the item for credit, and subsequently ordered a regular coiled cord from Whistler directly as I could not find one offered on Amazon."
4,"didnt need it, why would you?","comes with 2 cords . 1 straight to hard wire, and 1 coiled. Maybe you need this to mute it from beeping every few seconds?"
2,SENT IT BACK,"SENT IT BACK BECAUSE WHISTLER PHONY RADAR DETECTOR IS JUNK RETURNED RADAR DETECTOR ALSO, A DON'T BUY WHISTLER PHONY RADAR DETECTOR"
4,E.L.P. has matured with style,"Don't go out and buy this expecting Brain Salad Surgery or Tarkus etc. This is a strong album reflecting the maturity of the artists and skills. I personally can appreciate a band never staying in one place and definately don't want E.L.P. to be sounding the same as they did 30 years ago, however I do appreciate them being in the same genre. This album has some beautiful music and I can strongly recommend it to someone looking for something to relax and really ""get into"". Lake's vocals, although much changed, are strong and right on the money. The band is tight and sounds like they have been together forever. Too bad they couldn't keep this up."
5,PAPER BLOOD: BRILLIANT COMMENT ON CONSUMERISM,"ELP reunite and deliver their magnum opus. This album features instant classics like ""Black Moon"" and the incomparable ""Paper Blood"". Greg Lake's bass work on the latter is amongst the best ever recorded, and coupled with his soaring vocals and keyboard wizardry from Keith Emerson it makes for a formidable piece of socially conscious rock. Carl Palmer's contribution to the album is also not to be overlooked; the core of ELP is as powerful as ever. The album is a joy to listen to, but the live performances on the ""Live at the Royal Albert Hall"" DVD take the tracks from Black Moon to stratospheric heights. Both this album, and the aforementioned DVD are HIGHLY recommended to ELP fans, as well as the musically ignorant."
4,More Mature Sound,"It's not a bad album. It doesn't rock like Brain Salad Surgery, but at the same time I think it qualifies as amore sophisticated sound for ELP. They still play well together, and as usual I would say that their sound herewould be regarded by many as being progressive. If you'rea big Keith Emerson fan there's something here, and likewise if you're a big Greg Lake fan there's something here as well. Palmer as usual does his own thing like no other drummer can. I really like the lyrics for 'Paper Blood' and 'Black Moon', and what Emerson does with 'Romeo & Juliet' is fun to listen to."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"When I bought this album I was already a huge early ELP fan. I was really hoping they would write at least one song that harked back to their progressive days, but sadly they didn't. Most songs, although tightly played (as you'd expect from world class musicians) range from decent to weak. A drab offering of music stuck between pop and geek-rock. A project with alot of unfulfilled potential. Pass it up."
4,Surprisingly good,Affairs of the Heart and Burning Bridges are two excellent treats on this album. Romeo and Juliet would love their bit on this album as well. Close to Home is a wonderful Emerson work. One of the few ELP albums that sound good in the car.
3,"NICE TRY, BUT FAR FROM THE OLD TIMES","I'm not a big ELP fan, but I know when a prog group stars to decline. ""Black Moon"" and ""Changing States"" are prety good but the rest are simply too light for ELP."
4,Not bad at all,"This record really grows on you. It has excellent songs and performances; i recommend it for ELP fans. Of course you will not hear the old magnificent songs they wrote, but this cd is worth every dollar."
4,Great sound on the 2011 re-issue!,"ELP's 1992 album ""Black Moon"", has been updated with great sound, the music shines through. Nice liner notes in this great package. If your an ELP fan, get these 2011 re-masters."
1,ELP Goes POP - Lets Us All Down.,"I am a lifelong fan of ELP. My favorites are WORKS and Trilogy and the Self-Titled CD but overall, I believe there is something awesome in every ELP album. Except this one. This was the only ELP CD that I did not yet own because I was scared to buy it. Now that I have purchased it I am at a loss for words.This is not the ELP that I remember. This is an attrocity. So I did some reading up on the subject and I found out that this album was basically belched out in order to fulfill a contractual obligation. Don't expect any of the same energy you're used to from ELP. Clearly, their hearts are not in it with this one. It has a rushed feel and there is nothing impressive here.I am sorry. I really wanted to give a better review than that because they are my all time favorite band. But I cannot.-(V)az"
5,revolutionary,"Big, ugly and awfully streetwise, Eva Wylie turns over all characteristics commonly attributed to the female sex. From the very beginning the reader submits to her way of seeing and laughs about the flatness of all other characters around her. My favorite example: When Goldie is making up her eyes Eva's comment brought tears to my eyes so hard I had to laugh. Two thumbs up for the first STRONG literary heroine!!! Men around her become awfully ridiculous and short-sighted and women robots of female socialisation. Anna Lee was already an astounding character but Eva is really on top!The (female) world has been desperately waiting for Eva Wylie...Thank you so much, Liza Cody!!!"
2,No C++,"This book is useless as a C++ reference. The front cover says that it ""Demonstrates ADO using VB, C++, J++ and scripting languages with ASP""What a load of bunk. There is very very little C++ and I could not look at myself in the mirror if I would have made that claim."
4,Decent Reference,"Good in depth reference on the ADO object model, but nothing new provided on MSDN CDs except for one topic - the performance analysis. It is a must read issue if you programming with ADO & SQL."
5,Worth your investment.,"I bought this book and I am very satisfied with author's work on ADO. I have read this book completely. I very much like the way the concepts are explained and discussed. I strongly recommend it to other readers.However, I did find some debatable assertions on following pages:Page#11 JDBC was designed by Microsoft.Page#14: DNA is a old, simple, open architecture strategy made up of ideas and suggestions.Page#15: MTS, IIS, ASP, COM,DCOM, COM+, Visual Basic, VC++, VJ++ are all open and very simple to use technologies.Author directly and/or indirectly tries to elevate readers confidence through these statements. As Alex has done a good job all over, I am not yet ready to flame him for these minor things."
5,An excellent reference on ADO,"I've been waiting for this book for more than 2 months, and it proved to be extremely useful and enlightening. Kudos go to an excellent organization of the book, examples and explanations that accompany every aspect of ActiveX Data Objects. Although on-line documentation is useful, this book is more user-friendly, and is worth its weight in gold.An additional bonus to the book are the chapters on Data Shaping and Performance, which provide excellent guidelines for ADO developent."
4,An excellent reference,An excellent reference book and has some useful tips. In some areas it's a bit short of examples and explanations for the novice.
2,C++? I don't think so!,"The caption on the front of this book says: ""Provides a concise, comprehensive guide to the ways ADO 2.0 can be used in all kinds of applications. Demonstrates ADO using VB, C++, J++ and scripting languages with ASP.""I have no issue with the first sentence. The second sentence, however, is a blatant lie. I think Wrox should be ashamed of themselves. There are a combined total of less than a page of things referencing C++ in here. If you're going to claim something, maybe you should make sure you actually deliver. This is pathetic.I, for one, am not planning on buying any more Wrox books in the future.Tom McKearney tmckearn@hotmail.com"
2,Might be accurate if you're only programming in VB,"This book is absolutely useless if you're programming in anything other than visual basic. Even then, there's not much that couldn't be found in Microsoft's own Visual Basic tilted help pages.The book claims that the C++ code easily follows from the VB code examples. This is an outright lie. Function declarations are often ordered wrong or are typed incorrectly. When you do finally sort out the function calls, it's next to impossible to figure out how to pack the variants for ADO. Something this book goes into NO detail describing.For example, where the book says you can enter an index or bookmark (which is true in VB), it leaves out that you have to pack the number in the 8th reserved slot of the variant.Don't buy this book, search dejanews instead."
3,A reference for functions,This book just gives reference to the object functions but lacks examples on putting ADO together. I had a C++ project that I had to mostly figure out by trial and error.
3,Where did those C++ references go?,"I, too, have a gripe about the misleading claim that there are C++ and Java examples. Even though VB Programmers make up the largest part of the programming population, some people still have to use other languages. So, DON'T claim you've got it if you DON'T have it. On the positive side, it really does do an excellent job of presenting all the object interfaces in ADO. Let's face it, there are very few of us who don't use the wizards when we can get away with it. But on those rare occasions when you can't, this book can dig you out of some pretty deep ditches!"
2,Not a good book for C++ and Java programmers,Misleading advertising...cover states that there are Java and C++ examples--about two pages worth... The rest are in VB
3,"Not bad, needs non-slip rubber feet and added weights","*This product is very small, I expected a bit larger. Total height is less than half the height of my Galaxy Nexus.*Very lightweight. Some added weight in the bottom of the unit would add stabilization.*There is no grip on bottom, which causes it to slide just about every time you interact with it.*The opening for bottom of phone is very slim, SamsungGN with (standard verizon holster) back shell just barely fits. Consider the thickness of your device before buying. This is really a universal stand, so making it fit perfectly is impossible--but realize that not every phone will fit securely.*Where the back of the phone rests is very nice--with a soft felt-like protective material.*The bamboo has some type of laminate which makes it smooth to the touch. I was hoping for more of a raw feeling as the smoothness makes it feel ""mass produced""."
5,This was my all-time favorite book from the ages of 10-12!!,"I read this over and over as a child, checking it out of the library week after week. It is the exciting and rather romantic story of a teenaged boy named Joe, who is a trick rider in a circus. When he is orphaned and the authorities put him in a grim home for boys, Joe executes a dramatic escape which almost kills him, and is taken in by a farm family who know he has secrets but are kind enough not to pry. Joe tries to forget his past but the colorful life of the circus is in his blood and he can't settle down to a more ordinary life. The neighboring farmers dislike and fear Joe and his somewhat wild and foreign ways. But when a horrifying accident occurs, Joe's circus training saves the day. I loved this book so much and always thought it would make an incredible movie. I hope it comes back into print!"
2,Jordan Valley History,More local history packed in to one book than can be found in any other book. The chapter on Big Foot read very well.
5,Its the message dummy,"I listened to this album and was pleased with the departure from garage band to a solo artist. I think that Mr. Keyes is a very talented individual and has a soulful rhythm that flows freely. It seems that there is more behind the man than just trying to sing a popular song. It occurred to me while listening to this album, that music is like storytelling in that it is about the story, or message in this case, not the empty lyrics spewed by some. Hopefully more people will be interested in listenting to this message."
5,OUTSTANDING,"This CD was full of surprises. Each song was like opening a different package - unique and memorable.I found myself singing along after only listening twice. I want everyone I know to hear it, but I'm not loaning mine out!"
4,spellbinding!!!,"I've been listening to Wake Up, I really like it and agree its got a little bit for everyone. Its a mature departure from eclectic rock.So far my favourite tracks are the first and last, ""The Words of a Song"" and ""Boze, Cos Racil"" respectively.Already getting in the bad habit of listening to those two tracks and neglecting the rest but don't worry I'll get to them.The hard work put forth in this album does not go unnoticed!"
1,I hate this book,"This book does not deserve the one star that was required to register my review. What a waste of the author's considerable training and access to readers. I was chocked at the gross negligeance with which the author delivers the information, ""But the wound on Faith's right side falls almost exactly where Jesus was supposedly nailed to the cross"".There are so many errors in logic, plot and characterizations that this book barely qualifies as a cheap B-class romance novel.What an insult her poor craftsmanship is to the thinking adult reader. In spite of a creative and original concept and intriguing topic, this book is rubbish. Pure and simple trash."
2,Born on a Blue Day,"Well written but a very confusing book - I guess that's what autism is about and why we don't understand austistic people. I didn't particularly care for the book, but it was well written."
1,Disappointing,"Not at all what I expected. The writer then made an ""off the wall"" comment about Kansas. Perhaps she has never been here? Kansas is beautiful, and also the people. I hope you tell her."
3,faith,"The book is well written as usual for this author. However, it just did not do it for me. I think it was somewhat interesting, but the subject matter did not reallyinterest me at all."
2,KEEPING FAITH,I DID NOT LIKE THE STORY LINE - IT SEEMED WAY OUT THERE AND DID NOT KEEP MY INTEREST. IT IS THE ONLY JODI PICCOULT BOOK I HAVE NOT ENJOYED
1,Accidental Download. (Still billed for it though!!),"I didn't read this book. I downloaded it accidentally and erased it immediately.Consequently I have no idea of its content or plot and no opinion on its literary merit.I do, however, have an opinion on Amazon billing and charging me for an item i did not retain."
3,a good read,"I've read several Jodi Picoult books, and this one was good, but not the best. The characters were likeable, but the story line about the little girl being a stigmatic, and healing people, was pretty far fetched. But overall I enjoyed it, and will read more of her books."
4,Giving Hope,"Like many of Picoult's books, the plot was engaging and the writting outstanding. Picoult brings many of the characters to life, all the while keeping the reader guessing who is the bad guy, who is the good guy. Loved it."
3,Not Quite the usual Jodi Picoult,"The story was compelling, but I didn't like the picture of G*d that was presented. I do think it truly portrayed the way some religious frenzies wreak havoc, and also how the medai disturbs lives, too."
3,Keeping Faith,Great book. Very thought provoking. Made one think that our lives are fully impacted by things that are from another realm. This is a book all non believers must read
1,When I first starting to read the book,"When I first started the book I really enjoyed. To much repeating, and it took to long to get point across."
4,keeping Faith by Jodi Picoult,"I thought id read all Jodi s books but i happened on this one on amazon.Loved this book,but then again Jodi Picoult never disappoints! Im looking forward to a new release from her soon!"
3,Jodi Picoult's book Keeping Faith was recommended,"I haven't read ""Keeping Faith"" as yet but very accessable and easy to carry with you. Easily read with adjustible font size."
4,Keeping Faith by Jodi Picoult,"I love, love, love Jodi Picoult so I was really looking forward to reading this book. All of her books that I've read have a twist, so I kept waiting for the twist and trying to figure it out. As it turns out, this one doesn't have a twist. I felt the ending was anti-climatic and disappointing. I enjoyed most of the book though."
4,made you think.,Made me wonder about today miracles and how God works in out day in age. How deep a mothers love is and how it can mirror the love of our God.I really enjoyed this book and recommend it.
4,Easy reading,"Very good,but little too long.kept you interested. Book was easy reading but had a lot of characters to keep track of"
3,It's ok - raises questions,I have to agree with a lot of reviewers - this book was predictable and relationships weren't built properly. As I finished the book I felt the author barely had written anything original. So why did I like this book? Even though much of the plot has been done before - I think it's a good book club book. The author puts scenarios together that are great for discussion and reflection. The question of who is God and where is God in our own life is something this book doesn't answer - but seems to point out the need to have thought out answers for ourselves....
3,Thought Provoking,"My first book by this author and I found it riviting. It held my attention all the way through. I enjoyed the developement of the relationship between Mariah and Ian. Although there were no real answers to the questions brought up during the story, everyone seemed to come away with their own answers. I didn't quite understand the very end."
5,Wonderful and compelling,I wish I knew how the book ended...I left it at a baseball game when I was beginning the final chapter!
4,Kept me interested all the way through,"Good story, well researched. Compelling drama about a mother and wife who experiences great personal growth while her daughter goes through and increadible experience. Worth the read!"
5,A Great Exploration of Faith,"Jodi Picoult has another winner in KEEPING FAITH. I have read many of Ms. Picoult's books and I appreciate her rich writing style and her willingness to explore difficult issues and how regular people face them.In this novel, she explores the topic of faith - both faith in God and faith in the people we love. It was really ambitious to delve into the religious concepts she addresses here - a young girl starts to speak with God, who appears to her as a woman, and the girl both experiences the elements of religious ecstasy, including stigmata, and becomes a healer. Picoult handles all of these topics with respect, and she encourages the reader to come along on the journey of questioning, doubt, and eventually, faith.Setting these religious questions against the backdrop of a divorce and custody battle, Picoult grounds the story in the real drama and turmoil of a family. Ultimately, it is that love of a family that restores everyone's faith in each other."
3,Picoult,"I read all her books as I can. I did not like the story line in this one much. I do beleive in God, and some how this seemd to make fun of His works. altho I can understand where she was coming from with it. I loved her writing tho. she is one of my FAVS"
2,Didn't really care for this book.,"This book is interesting enough to keep your attention and keep you reading, but I was really dissappointed in the book, and wished I hadn't wasted my time reading it. It has some okay moments, but it's very sad and depressing. Some of the events that happen in the book, the author just didn't follow thru giving you more information about, just leaves it, and you're left wondering what happened after that. The ending I hated. I read the last two pages 3 or 4 times, and never really figured out what it said. The book was a good idea, but guess the author isn't very good. I do not recommend anyone reading this book."
2,Couldn't finish it,"First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few ""novels"" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. ""Pop lit"" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book."
4,"Great book, not so great ending.","I loved everything about this book, from the main characters, to the storyline. It kept my attention and I was sad everytime I had to put it down! The only thing about this book that I was not pleased with was the very last page!! To me, it was sort of anticlimactic."
4,touching,"I thought the feelings of the parents for and with their child were realistic. It shows how easily things can be misinterpreted. I would have liked a clearer ending, but it fit well with the book."
4,Faith,"At beginning thought it was not my cup of tea but as book developed and contemplated same issues as I was considering, I became more and more involved. My rational brain enjoyed the explanations and my emotional the romantic side."
2,Too Farfetched,"I usually like Picoult's works, but I did not like this one. Too hard to swallow. Please stop w/ the word requirements."
4,Keeping Faith,A very thought provoking story leaving you to wonder just what your own conclusion should be and at the same time a wonderful story about a mother's love and her impact upon her child. A good read.
1,Frustrating,"I was really looking forward to this novel because the storyline really intrigued me. However, I couldn't get past 100 pages and even those were a huge chore. Picoult's writing was unimpressive. Her characters and dialogue were plastic. The situations were overwhelmingly derivative and farcical. I have no problem becoming immersed in another world or believing the unbelievable when directed by a capable author. In other hands, this could have been a great story. But with Picoult, there was no getting past the fact that this was fiction, and poorly written at that. Truly disappointing."
1,Disappointed,"I too was very disappointed by this book. Having read this author previously and enjoyed her books, I thought this one would be an interesting and enlightening read. No way. The story was flat. The romance reeked of romance novels (really, his hair was like a raven wing?). I was truly offended by that stuff. I wondered if we were experiencing a ghost writer and Miss Jodi has just become too successful."
3,it was okay,not my favorite Picoult novel. Got slow for me about halfway through and not a shocker ending which is what i like about her books.
3,dissapointed,"It took longer than I hoped to receive the book, when it did come it was not in Large print which I ordered. So I have not been able to read the book."
4,Excellent book!!,"Fabulous book really made me think a bit different than other books by Ms. Picoult, but just as captivating! Highly recommend!"
4,Quite the Little Dog-and-Pony Show,"I am left with questions: Why does Ian need to keep his brother a secret? Why can Faith resurrect the dead but gives Michael just a few moments of lucidity? Why is the ending so obscure? (Ambiguity would be thought-provoking, but this ending backs away as if it is too afraid it might offend someone.) Why didn't the author research Cathloic dogma & doctrine more carefully? (I can only assume her treatments of Judaism, medicine & law are equally slapdash.) And finally - Must Picoult use so many cliches? ('Dog & Pony Show' appears 3 times in this narrative. Once would be too much.)"
3,"My favorite author, but not my favorite book","I've read several Jodi Picoult books and consider her one of my favorite authors, but I just didn't enjoy this book like some of the others. It gets bogged down in the middle with religious detail. I understand the need to have it in the story but it just seemed to go on and on. The mother-daughter relationships were very good, as was the relationship between Mariah and the atheist. I was drawn back in before the end, but I did a lot of ""skipping ahead"" through the middle."
4,Sweet!,"This is such is sweet story.It is an intense story and slightly controversal topic like Picolt's other books, but has a lighter tone.I highly recommend it. It is one of the best and is also a good one for readers interesting in Picoult and wanting a feel of her writing style and story lines.Check it out, give it a read. Perfect any time and a great gift for Picoult and read lovers!"
3,Inclusive ending,"I didn't like the ending, I felt it left me hanging. I was ready to turn the page to read the next chapter when I realized it was over!"
3,Keeping Faith,The plot moved slowly and in circle at times. It was lacking in real suspense and character development. I would like to have seen more variety in the setting.
2,Nonbeliever Cannot Enjoy,I usually like Jodi Picoult novels although they tend to be predictable/similar to one another. This one actually wasn't because the ending made no sense. I've never written an amazon review before of a product but decided to review this book because it pissed me off so much. The ending is absolutely terrible. The book was pretty boring throughout and way longer than it needed to be but I kept waiting to get to the end so I'd finally understand why all this was happening. She explains nothing. It was so stupid. Waste of money.
5,Keeping Faith -is another winner by Jodi Picoult,I haven't as yet found a Jodi Picoult book that disappointed me. She writes well and the stories are engrossing.
2,Could not get through this book.,Gave up half way through this book after trying very hard to finish. I thought the mom was a whiner and the wanted more insight from the daughter and father. It fell flat too early for me to get to the end.
3,I had to Keep the Faith to finish.,"I am a real Piccoult fan, and when this book was on sale I picked it up via my Kindle app. I had a tough time following the story line and it didn't seem as believable as some of her other stories. Jodi Piccoult's printed books usually have different fonts to distinguish which character is speaking. That did not translate thru the Kindle app, and it made it difficult to follow.I have read almost every book by Jodi and this is the first one that didn't wow me."
4,Addictive!,"I couldn't put this book down. I loved it! Picoult did a wonderful job of making sure you felt like you HAD to know what happened next.This book really makes you think about God and peoples relationships with God. Something that is rarely done in modern literature.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the ending leaves you second guessing as to what you just read and how you precieved the book up until that point. Which, depending on the person, could make it a better read or leave you confused."
4,Interesting concepts,"I recently finished the book ""Keeping Faith"". I found the book fascinating to read, I had no idea where Ms. Picoult was going with the story, so I kept reading to find out. Although the book does not match my own personal beliefs, I enjoyed reading a story which challenged my pre-conceived notions, and made me think a little."
3,Not the best J.P. novel I've read,"This is definately not the author's best work. I felt that the characters could have been more developed, and I would have liked to know more about Ian's twin brother, how his life changed after meeting Faith, and how it changed his and Ian's relationship. The ending was a major disappointment, but the worst thing about the book was the medical inaccuracies. I wasn't aware that you could give Tylenol and Advil intravenously, nor have I ever sent my intubated patients down to radiology in a wheelchair. I felt that my intelligence was insulted."
3,"Well, I didn't hate it...","...But, there was something about this novel that left me scratching my head. From the very beginning of this story straight through to the not-so-shocking conclusion, I felt like I was hit with one ""extraordinary"" coincidence after another. This wouldn't have been a bad thing if they'd all manage to tie into one another by the end of the novel. Instead, it felt more like each piece was separate from the underlying message Picoult was trying to get across (whatever that was).It never felt like anything was fully fleshed out. I don't want to list too many examples because I don't want to fill this review with spoilers. But, the obvious religious angle, the miracles, the mother's history of depression and her later love affair with the teleatheist all played out for me in a giant muddle.I feel like there was a lot of potential here and I don't 100% regret reading it. However, it certainly left me wishing it packed more of the typical punch of a Jodi Picoult novel."
3,Easy read,"Jodi Picoult's books are formulaic , but still manage to be interesting. I wanted an inexpensive book to read on my Kindle and this fit the bill."
3,Too unreal,"I have read other books by Jodi Picoult which, even though beeing novels, give a much better picture of how much like real life their stories are"
4,A really good read,I really enjoyed this book so much. It was a page turner. I don't think I quite understood the ending though. still pondering the last page.
3,A Strange Plot,Not one of my favorite Jodi Piccoult books. A little depressing and strange. I would not recommend this book to Jodi Piccoult fans.
4,There are more mysteries to life than vision and logic,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. To believe I would have to be in Mariah's shoes, but in my shoes I can suspend belief and accept that things happen, whether we want them to or not and it is how we respond to those things that define us. I also like that while things can seem quite desperate in the short run, the long run always brings us beauty, wonder, and love that we may not have ever anticipated."
5,Keeping Faith,I love her books. This was great! If you haven't started to read her books start now. They just get better.
4,Good suprise,Very good read. I would reccomend to anyone wanting to read. It kept me interested from the start. A must read for all Jodi Picoult readers.
5,So good,Love this book. Happy endings are the best. Such a good author. Read this. Good stigmata story. I liked it.
3,Starts out slow...,"The second half of this book was really interesting reading... however, the beginning was very slow. I am novice to the beliefs/practices of Catholicism and Judaism, so maybe that is why I couldn't get into those parts. I am a true fan though of Picoult, and cannot wait to read the next!"
3,Not My Favorite Picoult Book,"Although I tolerated this Picoult title better than THE TENTH CIRCLE, it was another one that I could have lived without. I just never connected to the characters, and couldn't get involved in the story like I did with MY SISTER'S KEEPER and NINETEEN MINUTES.I know others have read this book and loved it, and I totally appreciate their opinions! For me, though, this one just wasn't a winner."
3,3.5 stars,"I liked this book. I thought it was different to write a book about a child who sees and talks to God, especially since God is a woman. It was very predictable, but I didn't care for the very end, it just didn't make sense to me."
3,faith in Keeping Faith,It was not as good as some of her other books. Had a hard time getting into the plot but it ended okay
3,"Interesting, but not great","I've read four of Jodi Picoult's books and I definitely found this one to be the slowest. Parts were really interesting and other parts just dragged. I could definitely picture the setting, the characters, etc., but sometimes the details bogged down the plot."
4,Great read!,"Easy, entertaining book about a little girl's religious visions. It was interesting to read how the different religions interpreted her visions and how the general public became obsessed with her."
5,great read,"This book is one of my favorites. I thought Jodi did a great job in writing the book. I really believed the story, and to me that is a great book!!"
5,love jodi,"i love jodi picoult's writing. they are suspenseful, easy to follow and almost all have been unpredictable until the end."
2,Not that great,This is not one of Jodi's better books. It is a little strange for my taste. I didn't even finish it.
2,Spoiler Alert:Large Print!!!,"I didn't read the fine print that this book is large print. So when I received it I saw the large print and sent it back to Amazon. Definitely be aware that this book has LARGE PRINT, if you want this book in large print great, if not don't buy it. I wasn't critical enough of the heading for this book and got what I deserved which was this book in large print. Never again, I'll check to make sure that the book that I want to buy is normal print and not extra large print like this is."
2,keeping faith by jodi picoult,"I found this a tedious read, with an unbelievable story line..Perhaps Jodi Picoult is not for me although it is the second book of hers which I have tried."
3,a bit ridiculous,"While it was entertaining, some of it was kind of ridiculous... she was trying to play with issues of faith and doubt and miracles, but much of it really made no sense. I have read other books by Jodi Picoult that were far superior."
4,Keeping Faith,"This is an unusual book, but it sure keep your attention. This story kept my attention throughout the entire book."
3,Not as I thought,I wasn't interested in this book as I thought I would have been. It seemed to drag on until the end I just wanted to hurry up and be done with it. And I love all of Jodi picoults books
2,sort of disappointed,I did finish it and I love Jodi Picoult's books. But this one was not a subject matter I could get into.
3,Review of Keeping Faith,"I thought it was very well written, however it started extremely slow and I didnt care for the ending.Keeping Faith: A Novel"
4,Loved this book!,"Jodi Picoult once again left me unable to put this book down. Very well written about such a controversial subject - which of course is her specialty. She made you feel as if you were living within the family. Making you dislike some of the characters immediately and then turning it around so that you could see the ""other side"". Loved it!"
5,A Poignant Read,"Keeping Faith is a very poignant and well written book. While it does speak to the issue of God, and what each of us believes that to be or not to be, I think this is mostly a book about the relationship between mothers and daughters, and to a minor extent, between fathers and daughters. To what extent would you go to protect your daughter or to let her know you believe her and have faith in her? Would you be willing to go as far as to have others question your sanity and not just that of your daughters? Good side issues in this book include the workings of the hierarchies in the Catholic and Jewish faiths, the workings of the mental health system and the workings of the judicial and legal systems. This book makes you think on many levels. I would highly recommend it."
5,Keeping Faith,Great book held my interest and did want to put the book down. Will read more of Jodie Picoult books.
5,Had me searching for time to keep reading!!,"I haven't read too many books by Jodi Picoult but am definitely going to check out more of her books after reading ""Keeping Faith"". This book was hard to put down; kept my interest; and had me searching for time to continue reading. She kept me wondering how this story was going to end!!"
4,Great surprise,"I ordered this because I liked the picture on the front.(I know,I know! You should never judge a book........) But I couldn't resist.It turned out to be very good mystery. And the emotions were so real-life. The characters were so real-life. However, the abilities of Faith is only something we could wish for. I bought the book because it was on sale and got a wonderful surprise."
2,Not her best by far,"I usually love Ms. Pocoult's books but though well written, the storyline was weak, the ending a big yawn. I hope she was just experimenting with this subject matter and it doesn't happen again."
3,after life,I am enjoying this book. Make you think about the after life. The little girl talks to God(who is a female). She got that wrong. He definitly is a male.
5,As advertised,Book was as advertised. Worth every cent. I would recommend this seller. Thanks for the great product for the great price.
5,Keeping Faith,Like all Jodi Picoult books this story was well written and the story had twists and turns so you didn't know the outcome till the very end.
5,Great book,"The author keeps it interesting, I enjoy all of Jodi picoult's books it's a great read keep them coming.E"
3,Keeping Faith,"I found it very hard to get into the plot of the story,not the usual up and go. KEEPING FAITH by Jodi Picoult"
4,Keeping Faith,Great book! I enjoyed the religious vs secular aspects. It was a compelling read which left me curious at the end. But then again don't all Jodi's books end like that?
4,Keeping Faith,"I particularly liked the subject matter of the daughter's unusual circumstances and tying it in the way Picoult did. However, I did not think that this met her usual excellent writing form. At times, it seemed written in a big hurry. Still, I really like Picoult's books as I know they receive good research on the various topics she uses."
2,Did not like any of the characters,"I felt the main character was too whiny and her ex is too self absorbed, just couldn't connect with any of them. I will try another of her books though as she does write well. I know that sounds like a contradiction but I can see her talent, just didn't like her characters."
4,A good read,The strength of a mothers love cannot be denied. Be protective of your children no matter what others may say.
3,Keeping Faith,"Very different story, but not as good as many of her other titles which I have read.Took some time to get into this one, but maybe that was me. Still enjoy the way shewrites and will always read a title of hers before looking for someone else."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!!!,"BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN----SPELLBINDING---COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN, BUT I HATE FINISHING A GREAT BOOK----JODI REALLY GIVES YOU A LOT TO THINK ABOUT-----HOW ABOUT A SEQUEL? AFTER ALL, LIFE STILL GOES ON."
4,Very good read ! Makes you think,This was a good read. I found the story eyeopening & touching. It's amazing how it shows the way issues are blown out of proportion and in another way hope & faith can make all the difference ....I would recommend it but I will warn people I found my self frustrated with how ignorant people are regarding depression & how quickly society is to judge....how the media is like vultures .... yet I liked the dynamic & I find her take on these issues as true.
3,Interesting Book,"I have not actually finished the book yet so I don't know how it ends, but it is sure an interesting subject for a book."
3,Overall good,"Once again I stepped outside my normal suspense genre to sample another style of writing. I still like my lead characters to be strong. This character was week...always on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She consistently made bad choices. However, her mother was feisty and I liked that character. Faith went through a lot to finally catch a glimpse of the type of mother she wanted and needed. The author gives a decent view of a woman finding herself and a daughter finally getting a mom."
4,Keeping Faith,Interesting unusual book but true to Jodi Picoult`s form of writing.Keeps you in suspense but the ending leaves you hanging and I would have preferred a definite ending not for it to be left to my imagination.However I would definitely encourage you to read this book if you love to get into a book and not be able to put it down.
3,Refreshing Read...,"Such a unique premise... with wonderfully written characters. I enjoyed this book immensely. It took a little longer than most of Picoult's books to really get into... but it was enjoyable till the end. If you haven't had the chance to read Jodi Picoult yet, do it! She is truly an amazing writer..."
2,Hard to follow .,i STARTED THIS BOOK ABOUT 6 TIMES. i LOVE jODY'S BOOKS BUT THIS ONE CONFUSED ME. I HAD TO GO BACK TO THE BEGINING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WAS WHO AND WHERE THEY WERE. i HOPE THE NEXT BOOK BY JODY IS CLEARER. I ENJOYED THE TOPIC AND THE LITTLE GIRL.
2,I love Jodi Picoult's writing,"I was a little disappointed at the ending, after going through all Faith's problems that there wasn't a explanation for her bleeding hands."
3,Hanging,"Good book, left you hanging at the end. I guess you had to draw your own conclusion. I like closure."
4,I enoy all of Picoult's books.,"I have enjoyed most of icoult's books, and look forward to the ""surprise"" endings. This must have been an early one--no surprise but an interesting subject."
4,"Great story, weak ending.","I love this author's work and read her often. But often I notice her endings are weak and vague. This story drew me in form the first few pages. I couldn't wait to get the chance to read again. I got to the end and went ""what?"". I wont revel any spoilers but just don't expect any big shock or twist at the end. Just enjoy the story."
1,too many unexplained events,"I am glad that this was not the first Jody Picoult book that I have read - not sure I would have continued with her others...I have loved most of her other books that I have read. However, I felt that Keeping Faith left too many unanswered questions which made the events in the book unbelievable. The ending was very disappointing - it did not bring anything to closure, nor did it lead you to make any of your own conclusions.Sorry to say that this book was a let-down for me."
3,Good motherhood relationships,"I read this as part of an online book group. I thought it had some good motherhood themes, like the relationships between Millie and Mariah and then Mariah and Faith. I liked the relationship between Mariah and Ian. I didn't like the stigmata stuff and all of the uncertainity revolving around if it was true or not. I do look forward to reading more of Picoult's other works and have just decided that maybe this subject matter and I did not mix."
4,Keeping Faith by Jodi Picoult,Story was captivating. Story of a mother's fight for her child. A little unrealistic that a father who made no attempt to take child during divorce decides less than a month later to sue for custody without ramifications from new wife. Question never answered about whether it was an imaginary friend or God seemed to be a combination of a cry for attention and a real miracle. but a well written story.
3,Intriguing Read,"I really enjoyed this book , but the ending was anti-climatic and puzzliing. I have read most of Picoult's books. So. I am surprised at how the book just dropped off. Oh, well. Bit disappointing."
4,Good reading.,Doesn't try to answer any theological questions. Just a good story about a mother learning to trust her own instincts to protect her child.
3,Should have been condensed,"The book was very good...I love the way that Picoult writes; however, the story could have been about 50 pages shorter and still had the same affect. I got really bored through the court case when everything was repeated from earlier in the story for the case. It just didn't move fast enough from about page 200 on. It drug a little bit for me.Don't get me wrong, I love the books of hers that I have read, but this one left a little to be desired."
3,Eh. Classic Jodi.,"This book had SO much potential. It wasn't bad but it really wasn't about you thought it was going to be about. You thought it was going to be about if Faith could see God or not and go into detail about it. It wasn't about that much at all, it was about a custody case and the cathloc church. And even in the end, I had to read it 3 times to make sense of what she was trying to say. And it still wasn't clear. It was good, it had it's moments, but I'm still waiting for something."
4,Jodi Picoult Never Grows Stale,"Jodi Picoult must love a challenge. This is an unusual book that deals with the issue of divine religious visitations, stigmata and miracles through the experience of a young girl after her parents divorce. Picoult understands the complicated relationship between parents and their children as deftly illustrated through Mariah White after her marriage disintegrates, and she is caught up in a media circus with her daughter. Picoult tackles a hot button topic with journalistic integrity; but still manages to weave a credible and believable fictional narrative. I look forward to reading her next thought provoking offering."
4,Keeping Faith,Jodi Picoult is one of the finest authors of our time. This book like all of her books keeps you interested from first to last page. Her research must be time consuming but certainly adds to the essence of her books. A wonderful read!
2,Not a page turner,"I had to read this book for a book club and that is the only reason why I finished reading it. It dragged on and on and on- a lot of fluff with religion thrown in. I can see how someone could see the ""deeper message,"" but the book was boring. And for 400 pages, it is almost a waste of time. Maybe if the book was half the size I would have somewhat enjoyed it and given it 3.5 stars."
3,just okay,This is the first book I've ever read by this writer. The subject interested me so I thought I'd give it a shot. I read it in about 4 days. Not great lit I have to say I wasn't really expecting fantastic writing but the story was entertaining enough. Don't think I'll go out of my way to read any more of Picoult's books. If you are looking for light beach reading then this might be a little better than a lot of what you'll find at airport book stands.
3,Picoult Fan,"I have almost every Picoult book and am a huge fan. However, this one is not my favorite. A little far fetched with imaginary friends and a little depressing at times because of the main characters perspective on life. Still a good story, just not very uplifting."
4,Riveting!,"Keeping Faith was my first Jodi Picoult read, and I am hooked on this author. The seven-year-old Faith who begins speaking to ""Guard"" and brings her grandmother back to life after a heart attack is a normal child in every way. Her parents have just separated and the strain is threatening to break her mother. But Faith's mother finds herself coping after her daughter's contact with a dying child who is cured brings on a massive assault by the press. In steps Ian Fletcher, an atheist and TV personality who ranges the country visiting and debunking claims of sightings of the Virgin Mary, the face of Jesus on a tree trunk and other such phenomena. He is the first to see Faith one night when she exhibits the stigmata on her hands. It is even more confusing when Faith insists ""Guard"" is a woman or, as it dawns on her mother, is God. Faith's father, horrified at the notoriety brought on by the media, files for custody of his daughter. How this mad circus proceeds is the delight of the reader."
5,Great read!,Robyn Carr never disappoints me. Enjoyed the characters and the fact that life can always get a little messy. Good read!
4,The wedding party,"This was a good read, Robyn Carr never disappointed. The plot was a little predictable, but still fun to see how it all turned out."
2,just not all that enjoyable,"I bought this book on my kindle, and all I can really say is that I am glad that I didnt pay full book price for it. I have had this book for over a month and I have yet to get past the 5th chapter"
2,You have to like the heroine and I didn't,"My title is basically my review. I didn't like Charlene. There are strong women and then there are self absorbed whiny people, Charlene fits the latter. Why the author describes Dennis as being loyal and wonderful is beyond me. He didn't have the gumption to break off his ""engagement"" before he starts an affair with the wedding coordinator. Charlene needs some snappy dialog and some female friends to get her on the right track but then that would be a Jennifer Crusie novel.....the premise for this book showed promise it just wasn't well executed."
3,"Good, but small for the price","This product has more subtleties of flavor than the typical Wispride spread you might find locally. However, I think the price is a bit steep for the amount of product you get."
5,Boyz II Men Rock!,"This boyz II men cd is fantastic! It is basically all of there best songs put onto one cd. The wonderful, heartfelt ballads such as On Bended Knee, Its so hard so say goodbye to yesterday, and End of the Road are all on this cd and therefore make it a must for all fans of Boyz II Men or in fact any fan of R and B. This is a great cd and i would reccomend it to anyone of any age."
4,Chic boot!,"I love the boot, the style, and can't beat the price. The wedge is very comfortable, and makes this boot more of a five - seven hour boot. It's a bit narrow through the toe, but I have wide feet. True to size. I love the way it looks with jeans or skirt."
1,Very poor quality makes is practically useless.,Dont waste your money on this product. Very poor voice quality.
2,Not the greatest,I'm a novice at CORBA and this book didn't prep me properly. Examples seemed to be Java examples ported over to C++. It was more of a reference than a learning tool. I've looked over the CORBA spec and a lot of the material from the spec is in the book almost verbatim.
1,disappointed,"I wanted to learn corba with this book but I realized that I have to rely on other sources to learn about it. This book contains excerpts from a book about corba with java and not c++, where the reference to java was not even removed and replaced by c++. Furthermore even as the unexperienced reader in corba I found many mistakes in this book regarding object and function definitions."
1,I do not recomend this book at all,"I was very disappointed with this book. Obviously the book is written in a rush. The whole content is not carefully written. Some parts are confusing. If you want to get some pieces of code, maybe you can take a look. However, if you want to learn CORBA in C++, this is definitely not a good book."
3,Gigantic,Be warned that this lock is more than twice as big as a standard TSA luggage lock.From the size it should stand up to more abuse since all parts are heavier than standard locks.
3,Jerry Vale -- Love Songs,"The album is well recorded, but the songs on the album are not going to be familiar to very many people. I like to listen to Jerry sing songs that he has made popular or that were done by another artist. I just do not find this an album that I like listening to. Suggest ordering a different Jerry Vale album."
5,"This is ""The One""","After wasting money on three other cases, I finally stumbled onto the Contour Showcase. It's far superior to anything else I've seen out there. I use it on my 40gb 4G and I bought one for my daughter's 20gb 4G as well. You will not be disappointed with this product!"
4,Great Product,I have had four cases for my ipod and this one is the best. Although the front and back plastic shields do scratch fairly easily the rubber sides protect the ipod when it is dropped.
2,Easily damaged.,"I had high hopes for this case but when I put it on my belt and walked around the house, I accidently bumped lightly against a bookcase and it cracked. I was surprised since I barely brushed the bookcase. I called Contour Design and they had me send it back to them but they determined it was not a warranty issue and will not replace or fix it. While the case did protect my iPod, I would not recommend it since it is too easily scratched or cracked. Get a case that has some flexibility to it and from a company that will stand by their product."
2,Wait before you buy....,The case is fine however you have to remove your IPod in order to use ITALK or ITUNES. Why even bother.
5,Great case,"I spent many hours looking for a solid case that would protect my U2 Ipod without sacrificing the look. This case is clear front and back, and the black sides match the Ipod perfectly. The clip is solid and the closing latch is secure. The case allows full access to everywhere you need to get on the Ipod to play, charge, or sync. No case can provide ultimate protection, but I have put this through a lot and it has been wonderful. It has a few scratches, but I would rather scratch the case than the Ipod itself.I also tried other cases when I orderd the Showcase and this is the best case available. Other cases are difficult, bulky, or even scratch the Ipod. This case is solid but protects the Ipod without scratching it. Insertion and removal are incredibly easy.Great case."
4,Looks great w/ U2 ipod,I got this case for my U2 ipod and it looks and works great. The only drawback is that the case adds bulk to the ipod. I wish it came in different sizes for different ipods.
4,Good case but very bulky.,"This is an excellent heavy-duty case that gives (near) full protection for your iPod sans the clickwheel and makes for great shock protection.However, the case adds tremendous bulk to the iPod and for those of you more anxious about appearances than protection, this is not the case for you. I ordered the case for my 5G video iPod and couldn't stand the bulkiness so I gave it to someone else who wasn't so concerned about looks as they were about actually preventing damage to their investment.So in summation, if you want serious, heavy-duty protection, get this case. If you want looks, go with something else."
1,Bad Jokes Make For Bad Attitude,"First of all this isnt a movie. It's a stand up comedy act, and its not funny. On the box of this movie it says ""..wildest party imaginable..."" but its really the lamest movie I think Ive ever seen. Basically, the movie consists of a stand up comic entertaining some corporate party. He tells the kind of jokes you might hear from that dorky uncle when you were six. Or maybe the kind you would see in a book of elephant jokes in a children's library. They do have a few girls that dance around but it is a COMPLETE waste of money. The only reason why i would buy this is so i could give it to someone as a bad gift. Like for instance....to that dorky uncle i had when i was six."
3,"Nice looking, but scuffs easily and has a bright yellow sole","Love this shoe for special occasions, but it scuffs easily and has a weird yellow square of rubber as part of the bottom sole. It looks really tacky from behind when my son is walking or when he sits down and the bottom of his shoes are exposed. Would have expected a more classy looking bottom to this shoe. Fits well, though, and if you sharpie the yellow square, it doesn't look too bad on the bottom, either. Overall - a good product for occasional use, so long as you take good care of them."
4,Tom Brown's School Days,"I have enjoyed this book very much. It was one of those classics that I thought I had read, but indeed had not. I prefer literature written prior to the 20th century."
1,Useless for me,This mitt is much to thin to absorb any soap for washing and there is not enough texture for exfoliating. Very dissapointed with the product as I can not use it as was intended.
3,I made the classic mistake,"If you saw my review for the first ""This Is Trance"", I take back what I said. It appears that time has made me like volume 2 more than volume 1 afterall. Now I'm going to go out on another limb here and say that at least volume 2 is better than volume 3. Come see my review at volume 3 to see why. Oh wait, I guess first I'll give you my favorite songs from this volume. They are: Nocturnal Creatures, A forest, Spread your wings, Embrace me, Reflections, and Proceed. Even though by the time I got this cd I had already played out Proceed, because I already had it on another cd. But I just recently started playing it again and I'm back in love with it. Its just too great of a song to play out completely."
4,The Very Best of Gong,This is a 1997 British import on the Charly label. It contains a nice sampling of the best tracks from their classic period of the early to mid- 70's. The tracks included are: 1. Dynamite I Am Your Animal 2. Radio Gnome Invisible 3. Zero the Hero and the Witches Spell 4. Flute Salad 5. Oily Way 6. Outer Temple 7. Inner Temple 8. I Never Glid Before 9. The Isle of Everywhere 10. You'll Never Blow Yer Trip Forever 11. Eat That Phonebook Coda and a bonus track 12. Stone Innocent Frankenstein. This disc is a great introduction to the band or it can also just save you the time of making up a favorite tracks cd of your own. You can't go wrong with this collection.
4,"Many good tips, a little repetitive","Got some tips out of the book that I definitely will use. Some were repeated in later chapters/topics. Perhaps this was for the benefit of ""spot readers."""
5,A MUST FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL,I picked this book up before a trip to Europe last summer. I didn't have a clue about how to pack until I read this book. It truly saved me from having to much stuff to lug around.My niece is going to Italy for her first trip abroad and I am getting ready to send her one.It is a great gift for someone planning a trip ...anywhere!
4,"Good Description of Subnetting, Silly Analogies","This book is great if you are looking for an explanation of subnetting, something which is hard to find. If you are looking for such an explanation, BUY THIS BOOK!Since I'm not a complete novice in the networking world, I found most of this book to be ""fluff"", but there was some useful information. If you prefer a book that is to the point, without silly analogies, this is not the book for you."
5,Excellent,"The book arrived on time, in great condition, just as any customer would want and expect. So, I was very happy!"
3,Kawaii ^^,I thought this book was very cute :). The plot did seem slow and the last volume sort of confused me though. This was also one of my first mangas and I really enjoyed it!
4,"Brosnan made the movie, music could have been better.","I watched this movie on cable several years ago and have been searching for it for awhile, unfortunately I could never remember the name, until now. I am a true fan of Pierce Brosnan, since his debut as Remington Steele. 'Live Wire' allowed viewers to really see Brosnan. He was angry and vengeful, arrogant and cruel, comical and so very sexy, and physical. If not for starring Brosnan, the movie would have never been able to hold my attention. The music really sucked, and Silver well he has done much better work. I recommend this movie to anyone who can't get enough Brosnan. No collection of Brosnan films can be completed without 'Live Wire'."
3,Just and ok movie,"I enjoyed this movie, but I guess my expectations were a little too high. The idea was interesting (the exploding acid stuff), but the plot could have been improved upon. Brosnan did a good job, though. Too much stuff about the wife with that other guy and his dead daughter. Made the movie drag. Besides that, it was decent at best. Nothing spectacular."
2,"Instead of a big bang, Live Wire delivers a pop","In this not-ready-for-Bond primer, Pierce Brosnan plays an FBI explosives expert who can't figure out a series of deadly D.C. detonations that has the nation's capital on edge. The mysterious explosive premise is a good one, however the movie suffers from a made-for-cable feel (perhaps because of the terrible music). The cast does a good job with a fair to middling script, but a few characters just don't belong. Namely Lisa Eilbacher as Brosnan's promiscious wife. Usually a reliable actress, she's reduced to eye candy in this one. Ben Cross does a smash-bang job as the heavy, but Ron Silver is dead weight as Cross's congressional co-conspirator. All in all, Live Wire delivers an interesting pop, but is far from the entertaining big bang you might expect from a film featuring the future James Bond."
5,"A Diary of Private Prayer (hard cover, 1939 version, used)","I purchased this book as a surprise replacement for the same edition that my sister had used daily for six decades, but was lost during a hospital stay. Although her copy had been heavily annotated, this replacement copy's interior appeared untouched and the exterior was only slightly worn. This replacement copy was a wonderful blessing for my sister and I am so very thankful for the seller's association with Amazon, making it possible for me to locate it."
1,Visually Cheap,"The overall appearance of the printed page is repulsive. Overly bold type, type size far too small for the weight of type face, cheap quality paper. These were to be gifts to treasured friends. A huge disappointment. I've owned a hardback copy for 40+ years and it is still elegant in its visual appeal. The current physical copy is a slap in the face to its spiritual content."
4,Inspired patterns for private prayer,A wonderful book of morning and evening prayers for 31 days with a special pair in the back for Sundays. The older English language usage takes a bit of getting used to but that's worth the effort. They are to be read slowly and meditatively. Pause for silence in places. These prayers encourage examen and inspire adaptation. Make them your own. This edition leaves a blank page in front of every prayer for your own notes. A good book to have and use during Lent.
4,Errors in Kindle Version,"Just to note that the Kindle version I just purchased is missing the entry for the Morning of the 26th day of the month, and has a typographical error (""Thirtiethh"") on the Thirtieth Day."
2,Buy LIve In Montreux instead.,"At first im a deep fan of ELP and own all their records. I saw them 4 times live and saw their biggest show in history in Montréal in 1976.I strongly suggest that you buy In Montreux instead of this DVD.The production here is badly film and the sound is not good at all only in stereo. Also they are not at their best that night.The live in Montreux is very well produce, the sound is very good and available in 5.1 plus they are in top shape.Don't spend any money on this one you will regret it."
3,Good but not great,"I am a casual listener of ELP, I use to listen to ELP cd more often when I was younger. For me, the band has not succeed in the time test. Their music has not aged very well. I still apreciate classic like ""Tarkus"" and some ""Brain Salad Surgery"" stuff (which is under represented on this cd)and songs like ""Still, you turn me on"" or ""Lucky Man"" but when half an hour of ELP has been playing in my house, I feel the urgent need to listen to something else. Good album, but not great."
3,"What's with those electronic drums, Carl?","This could have been a great live album. Heck, it SHOULD have been. Even with Greg Lake's limited vocal range (hear how he tries, and fails, to reach the studio standard of Pirates). But then Carl Palmer starts bashing those awful, AWFUL electonic drums. And no matter how good the band as a whole sounds, I can't get past that."
4,Emerson Lake&Palmer-'Live At The Royal Albert Hall'(Rhino),"Maybe not as brilliant as their earlier live album,but '...Albert Hall' is a damn fine piece of work.Total of eleven tracks with a duration of 69:18.I was so excited when I went to see the progressive power trio on the eve of this very tour.Reunions are great,aren't they?Most of the older cuts were present that I wanted to hear,like ""Karn Evil No.9(1st Impression-Part Two)"",""Knife Edge"",""Still...You Turn Me On"",""Lucky Man"",the thirteen minute epic ""Pirates"" and the fourteen minute ""Fanfare For The Common Man/America/Rondo"".Whew!Thanks for the ride.A couple of new(at the time)tunes seemed to fit well in with the rest of the set,""Black Moon"",""Romeo&Juliet"" and ""Paper Blood"".WELCOME BACK MY FRIENDS TO THE SHOW THAT NEVER ENDS!COME INSIDE!Long live Keith Emerson,Greg Lake and Carl Palmer."
5,Still rip-roaringly funny after all these years,"""Fawlty Towers"" is still the funniest sitcom I've ever seen, and anyone who loves comedy and hasn't seen it, should. The additional features on the DVD were also interesting, especially the background on the location. A+++!"
5,"Excellent quality, great price!",Wonderful collection and quality at a teriffic price. Probably the finest or one of the finest series of all time.
5,Timeless Classic,"I enjoyed Fawlty Towers many years ago on PBS. It's been fun to watch them over again...they're still funny. When I don't have time to watch a full length movie, I can watch one or two episodes. I'm sorry they only made a few episodes."
2,missing episodes,"Sadly, discs 1 and 2, although labeled as different discs, had the same episodes on them. As a result, many of the promised episodes were missing. This was not the vendors fault since the discs themselves were clearly labeled as ""1"" and ""2"", but an error on the part of the BBC production department."
5,first order for Fawlty Towers,The first order for Fawlty Towers was due to be received on December 19. It did not arrive. I contacted Amazon. A second order was sent and was received on December 24 (in time for Christmas). I received the first order on January 3 and contacted Danielle at Amazon. She e-mailed a new address label and the package was mailed back to Amazon on January 4. Danielle was very helpful. Thank you.
1,"Fawlty Towers - The Complete Series, DVD","The Fawlty Towers episodes are hilarious and deserve their growing cult status. However, this DVD set is poor quality and not recommended. The problem is the compression used in order to fit the series on three DVDs: the frame-rate has been significantly reduced. This would be mostly unnoticeable on a slow moving film, but there is considerable amounts of fast movement in Fawlty Towers, so the result is a very distracting, jerky effect where actors magically jump from one position to the next. There is also a graining quality to the image that suggests other types of compression. What's the point of a DVD when the VHS delivers better viewing?"
4,Crystal clear picture - poor special features,"The picture quality is so much better than the VHS versions! However, there are only a few out-takes included and as the other reviewers mentioned, the director's commentary is a waste of space.The interviews with John Cleese and ""Manuel"" Andrew Sachs are good but it is the wonderful quality of the picture that makes this set a must-buy for the Fawlty Towers aficionado."
5,CLASSIC COMEDY AT IT'S BEST!,"I bought this collection of episodes just recently. I really enjoyed the comedy in the show. There are some quite amazing things that take place at Fawlty Towers, but it's all good fun. John Cleese is a natural and this show highlights this wonderful man, because he portrays his character very well!This is good stuff! I highly recommend it- even if you're not familiar with it, because neither was I!"
4,Fun,Unless you're a die hard Cleese fan I'd skip the interviews which are a tad boring and go straight to the good stuff. The firt couple of shows are a little slow but it gets better as it goes along and will soon have you laughing merrily.
5,For fans of British Comedy and Monty Python!,One of the funniest British Comedy series ever produced ... some of John Cleese's finest work for the small screen. Much of his inspiration for his character in A Fish Called Wanda can be seen germinating in this BBC Television series.Recommended for anyone having a bad day ...
1,Insulting,"I'm a big Fawlty Towers fan but this remastered edition begins with a BBC bigmouth telling you how great the BBC and English humor are, and you can't get to the shows you paid for without listening to this boor first. Every time you turn it on. Five minutes. I paid for the damn thing, why do I have to endure this drek? Drop dead BBC."
3,Great DVD Set - if you have binoculars,"Love this series which is, IMHO, the funniest sitcom series ever shown on either side of The Pond. There's no disappointment in re-watching all the wonderful episodes.There is, however, beaucoup de frustration with the way in which the links were designed. You have sit right in front of the TV, no more than 4' away to read the postage-sized stamps which indicate episodes, commentary, etc. (I still can't read them.)Still, once you get going, it's hours of laughter, great performances, and great writing."
3,A Five Star Series with Technical Difficulties,"I LOVE Fawlty Towers...LOVE IT. But I've had issue with this particular collection not working in my DVD player. In the final episode of disc 1 ""The Germans"" the screen freezes as soon as the setting changes from the hospital to the hotel."
1,Faulty Indeed,"I bought the Fawlty Towers series on American Amazon, only to discover that is cannot be played on American DVD players. Very frustrating; Amazon needs to protect its customers more than this, ezpecially as it continues to devour other retailers. This makes me furious as a long time Amazon user."
4,"Its John Cleese, How Couldn't It Be Successful?","Although Fawlty Towers was a low-budget British TV comedy program that was inexplicably cancelled after a few episodes, it had excellent writing and funny scripts."
4,Funny DVD!!,Full 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers...if you are a fan of the show you will love this dvd...classic.
5,Laughter is the best medicine,"My wife and I watch Fawlty Towers on Saturday nights as a relief from the negative media barrage. The episodes have never let us down, and we hee-haw all evening. We love to watch them over and over. Great movies, those British sit-coms."
5,I laugh out loud every time I watch Fawlty Towers,"John Cleese has got to be one of the funniest men alive. His creation, ""Fawlty Towers"", was the perfect outlet for his unique humor. The only problem is he only made 12 episodes. The bonus extras do an adequate job of background on both the series and the characters. I wish they had done more. If you are a John Cleese fan this is a must for your video library."
5,Pleased with Fawlty Towers collection,This collection contains all 12 Fawlty Towers episodes. The second season aired a few years after the first season. It also contains additional footage/interviews. Great collection especially if you love Monty Python!
5,Basil being Basil,Cleese is great as the inept Fawlty. The supporting characters are wonderful in every episode. Fawlty is the perfect victim.
5,Can't Fawlt It!!!!,"I've just moved to the USA from England and was pleasantly surprised to find i could get this classic series on DVD over here. I grew up watching this and will never tire of hearing Manuel say 'que?'. Some bits may be a little politically incorrect for today's society, but for me that's where the beauty lies. An excellent series unfortunately cut short, but probably all better for it (and it helps keep the price reasonable). If you've got this far and are still reading, stop now and buy it, the only regret you'll have is having waited so long!!"
5,Very good CD....goofy as always,The only problem is that there are too few episodes....because they didn't make anymore. Other than that the disk has all that were made.
2,The problem with this series is as with Python,that the dedicated fans of this show presume everybody who sees the show loves it. That is far from the case. Many people can watch Python or FT and easily nopt enjoy it. I for one see little humor in this series. Remember FT/python fans you don't speak for everyone when you write how you admire these tv works.
1,I simply don't find the humor...,"I was very much anticipating watching Fawlty Towers because of all the wonderful reviews given. I expected it to be witty, refined, and just plain funny, I found none of that. All I found was an extremely boring and unexpiring comedy. I don't see the humor in Basil falling down in every episode or slamming Manuel's head into the wall. After the first ""uno, dos, tres"" episode with Manuel, any other times Basil has a tough time communicating with Manuel, it just seems tired. There is no subtle humor because everything in the show is such an overtly over exaggeration. There is not an ounce of believability...I thought this comedy would be something the vein of The Office, Arrested Development, The Larry Sanders Show, Waiting For Guffman, etc. To say the least I was very disappointed..."
1,overRated!,"I'm sorry, but Fawlty Towers was at best a mindless sitcom. Characterization, plot, and even setting were a bare minimun as Cleese mugged his way to cheap laughs. It's funny for about three minutes and after that the same joke over and over just gets tired."
1,Agree the show is a tension fest and not that humorous at al,Let's face it if this show hadn't starred Python alumnus John Cleese this show would be as famous as Mind your Language.
4,My favorite comedy series on TV,"This was my favorite comedy series on TV. I had been hoping they would release it on DVD for some time and finally they did and i snapped it up. It is still funny. Perhaps not quite as funny when i first saw it spontaneously on TV the first time, but still it is quite funny, especially if you are John Cleese fan and like his form of humor."
5,Remastered fun,"English comedy - you gotta love it. This remastered edition is worth the purchase price it you were ever an afficianado. I remember trying to watch it on our PBS station with its poor antenna reception...so this is pure fun, or pure funny. Especially if you are a John Cleese fan."
5,Hilarious,"Would you believe there are only 12 episodes? This means you can buy the complete series in a convenient little packet of 3 DVDs, 6 hours, and just enjoy them again and again. And you will. It's positively brilliant. Every actor but one is imminently skillful and every script but one will make you laugh out loud, hard. Hit ""pause"" until it passes. I hope you can cope with the workplace stress, which it will remind you of. I left the workplace long ago and it gives me flashbacks. And damn, I wish I could be as thin as John Cleese. Instead, I have hair like Prunella Scales, and I happen to be proud of it. And that's a cool name for an actress, isn't it? Prunella Scales."
5,Well worth the investment,"Having purchased the previous Fawlty Towers complete series on DVD set three years ago, I was skeptical as to whether the ""Remastered"" version was worth it. I can assure you that it is. John Cleese's hilarious and insightful commentary alone is worth the extra investment. As well, the sound and picture quality are noticeably better, adding to the enjoyment. Highly recommended even if you have previously purchased the series on VHS or DVD. Enjoy!"
5,Fawlty Towers,"if you are a fan -- classic and timeless, and if you have never seen this -- you can't help but laugh at John Cleese and the rest of the Fawlty staff"
5,Fawlty Towers is great!,Hallarious! One of my favorite shows! Thanks! Sent it to all my children. They enjoyed it also. English comedy can't be beat!
4,Love to laugh - hilarious !,I used to watch these shows in the 70's and remembered laughing so hard. Re-watching these made me laugh again just as hard. How fun to have this collection to watch whenever I need a good laugh.
5,Fawlty Towers - classic British humor!,"This is buttoned-down doowhacka humor in the finest British tradition. Let's call it Monty Python for the whole family.I watched the series when it was originally aired, and I must say that this remastered edition is more viewable than the original!"
5,"If you like Monty Python, you'll love this","Fawlty Towers, is a beautifuly mastered comedy TV series. John Cleese is Hilarious as Mr. Fawlty. Just like Monty Python, it's sure to leave your sides in pain."
5,brilliant,"I still don't understand why they made so few episodes.This show is just brilliant.If you don't enjoy british humor this is not for you.If you do enjoy it, do yourself a favor and get the set."
5,Laugh til you cry.,If your concerned about being PC don't buy this. That is why it's so funny. Worth seeing again and again.
5,Fawlty Towers,"One of the funniest series ever on TV--in ANY country (that I've seen, anyway!) Cleese is brilliant--even though I've seen each of these episodes many, many times, I always find something new and funny in them. Poor Basil Fawlty--the precursor of such sad sack schlubs as Larry David and Michael Scott on the American ""Office"". Don't miss this--especially at this price!"
5,Fawlty Towers,John Cleese can make just about anyone laugh. This series of shows is totally hilarious. It is hard to decide which one is a most favorite because each episode has its own sort of theme and the cast seems perfect for the roles. Too bad there aren't more of these shows. Very worthwhile to get.
5,Fawlty Towers Complete Collection,I bought this set of DVD'S for my husband for Christmas and they were one of his favorite gifts. Good quality product.
5,Civilized Slapstick & Perfect Sight Gags... There is None Better!!!,"This British Comedy Series has to be on everyone's list of ""favorites"" and/or ""best"" program lists. I know it's on mine.The only bad things are that there are only 20 episodes and that John Cleese is now suffering from the results of the physical pratfalls he performed in the series. Watching him perform was (and still is) magic. Even his ""fist waving"" could bring hoots and hollars to the most sedate viewer. I always slipped into Pampers before watching the show, if you get my meaning.It's comedy was way ahead of it's time. Modernized to todays surroundings, it would rival anything on television for writing and character development. The one problem would be in casting. The original cast made the perfect ensemble. I can't imagine who could fill the shoes of the original cast members.I enjoyed every minute..."
5,Fawlty Towers Wonderful Bristish comedy!,I bought this for my husband as he is a fan of both John Cleese and especially Fawlty Towers. English humor at it's best. Great series!
5,"got it, haven't watched it","got it, haven't watched it, but enjoyed watching the shows and my video copies in the past."
5,Best of British humour,"I bought this as a gift for my SIL he was delighted.Having seen all the shows myself, I can only say that ""Basil"" is just too funny.""Allo Allo"" is a very good series too. The British making fun of the French during German occupied France"
5,A must have.,Although dated sets detract somewhat the overall effect is splendid. A must have in any collection.
4,Not Exactly My Favorite,"I like John Cleese, but perhaps this is a case where I just couldn't find myself liking this show.Go for it, if you like John Cleese in general, but that is really one of the only really good things about the show!"
2,I third the notion that tensionfest is the word,I find little humorous about this sitcom. I actually find it all pretty nervewracking and painful to watch.
2,Not bad but it's vastly overrated,This isn't so much a hilarious sitcom as a tension fest. Every talks half way to a whisper most of the time. Cleese looks inbred and mildly retarded. Maybe this explains why in real life he thinks it's funny to go around harrassing people.
5,I Never get tired of watching this series...,"I recently bought this DVD to replace two worn out VHStapes of Fawlty Towers that I taped off public television19 years ago. John Cleese and his then wife, AmericanConnie Booth, co-wrote the series together back in the mid-seventies, it's about a rude hotel owner and his interactionswith his guests and staff. They spent a week writing each episode. They sat side by side at a large table with a big roll of butcher paperin front of them and they would write down story lines, plots,funny words and sentences that would come to them. Then theywould bring these ideas together - pretty amazing. The humoris fast paced with many plots and subplots merging brilliantlyin the end. My favorites episodes are: ""The Germans"", ""Basiland the Rat"" and the ""Psychiatrist"". This is a great DVD!"
5,Classic Brit Comedy,"Have seen these episodes years ago when they first came out, which is why I bought it. Absolutely hilarious; John Cleese is absolutely brilliant"
2,Fawlty Towers DVDs dont work,"This DVD set is a real disappointment. I love the series, but am very annoyed about the quality of the disc. It skips and gets stuck on certain episodes. Why is that happening? I just opened it, put it in the dvd player and thats all.I do have to say though, that Amazon is doing a great job about this. I've contacted them and they are sending a replacement with a return shipping label to send back the defective one at no charge. So bravo Amazon for correcting this problem so efficiently! Thanks!"
4,Great Show but Sloppy DVD Collection,"POSITIVES: These classic episodes are even more spectacular on crystal-clear DVDs, most of the interviews are interesting, and there are a few good special features (for example, the documentary on Torquay and the real-life nasty hotel manager who served as the model for Basil Fawlty).NEGATIVES: The people who interviewed the cast members, and the people who provided the episode commentaries, seemed to be totally unprepared for their job, and appeared to be making up their questions and comments as they went along.BIGGEST SURPRISE: Andrew Sachs is a quiet, intelligent, dignified stage actor with a British accent, completely unrecognizable as the the goofy Spanish bellman/waiter he plays in the series!MOST UNPLEASANT SURPRISE: Andrew Sachs's interviewer never once asked him to do any lines in his goofy ""Manuel"" voice and character, so how do we know it was really him? It's kind of like interviewing Mel Blanc and never asking him to do Bugs Bunny."
5,Simply Hilarious,"John Cleese and team never fail to leave you laughing. If you like british humor, you will love this set. Lots of credit to the other actors and actresses, I don't know how they keep up with Cleese (I would be surprised if it was all in the script) and not break in to laughter themselves. Along the same lines, you may want to check out a Fish Called Wanda"
5,A Must Have!,"I loved the series on PBS. If you enjoyed John Cleese in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", or ""The Life of Brian"", This is a must have. This set includes interviews with All the cast. It's worthwhile watching, both the series, and the interviews.John Cleese outdoes himself as Basil Fawlty. The only drawbacks I can think of are A. The series was so short (12 episodes), and B. I had to stop the DVD frequently to groan on Basil's behalf.Silly. Absurd. Slapstick. Fun!!DC"
5,A classic that never gets old,"In my opinion, it's a toss-up between this and Blackadder as the greatest British comedy of all time. Warning: this complete set includes rather lengthy (and not always interesting) interviews with John Cleese before every episode. If you have no interest in the script-writing process or Cleese's relationship with the actor who played Manuel, then that might be a minor bother you'll have to fast forward through. But even so- this is a great series."
3,3 stars.,"*** Christians have made some absolute claims and that raises the hackles of those who disagree, leading to some arguments if the two meet. Unless the Christian has the information straight, they could be left stammering, having lived their lives believing because they believe without really thinking about the whys and good reasons for their beliefs. Books to help with this difficulty have been written in the past, and this one joins the ranks of the Case for Christ, the Case for Faith, or More than a Carpenter. The data is presented clearly in a linear fashion, point by point, so that a Christian apologist will have an arsenal of complementary scientific, logical, and scriptural evidences with which to fight the good fight. ***Amanda Killgore"
4,very good for the price,the only reson i gave this a four star review was that it doesnt come with very much foam. other than that it is very good and i would recomend it. it also will fit my remington 700 30-06 bolt action scoped perfectly. you can also fit a box of shells and a gun cover for hunting.
3,Plenty of room!,"Very little assembly required. The case holds my shotgun firmly in place. Sort of suspended in the middle of the case. With a 28"" barrel, my shotgun fits with about 2"" to spare. Room inside the case for some small extra items. The same case at a local sportsman store would have cost $30.00 to $40.00 more, at least! I am satisfied."
4,This is a really well designed case. Inexpensive but not super cheap.,"I would not feel too secure locking this as it would be really easy to break into but it is nice, nonetheless. After all, if you leave a rifle in a plastic case unattended, you're a bit of a tool, eh?I can see this being a very useful case as it will accommodate every rifle I own (not at the same time if you are from Rio Linda)For smaller rifles it works just as well as for larger rifles as it has internal straps and the way it's designed allows for a one-size-fits-all approach (with the foam inserts). I paid about 35 bucks per case. I think that is a fair price for these. Wouldn't pay more."
1,Plano verticle scope case junk,Very flimsy said it was airline approved when I checked with TSA after I bought it because it is so flimsy they said it is not TSA approved so it can not be taken on a plane or other craft from a TSA facility. My scoped rifle did not fit without many alterations and the lid still has to be closed and held like a over stuffed suit case to latch. As far as I am concerned the verticle case is a great idea I hate my guns laying on there sides the scopes get banged around too much so good try bad flimsy item.
5,Good product with a caveat,"The way that it's built protects a scope better than cases that clamp the scope and gun between two foam pads. I would not, however, trust putting a gun on an airlines in this case. The hinges and closing clamps are not strong enough in my opinion to withstand the abuse of airport baggage handlers. Nor is the material that the case is made of. It's fine, however, for transporting a gun to a range."
3,Transport only,"Good for the money on one hand. Good points price, locks, sits upright and for transport. If your in NJ or other states where it needs to be locked to go somewhere it's good. This is not a case to put your gun in and then put it in the closet or where ever like a soft shotgun case that will keep out moisture. Your gun will rust as did my Rem. 870. You will need a gun sock or dehumidifier packs or other devices so your gun wont rust. It doesn't seal.So what I did was buy a DryTek soft case and put it inside this case so it can be locked & transported easily. ( took the foam out ). Moister protection with a hard case without spending $300 for those other cases.Ed"
5,Works just fine.,I have used this case to carry a rifle back and forth to Europe. No problems with airlines or TSA and the case protect the gun fine.So why pay more when this case does an excellent job?
4,Plano rifle case,The case holds my rifle very securely. It takes up less space and keeps my rifle protected.
3,not the best,this case works but it's bulky and hard to fit your rifle securely.i sold mine to a friend.
4,great gun case,"This case protects your rifle by securly strapping it in. even if the case falls upside down, It's also approved for air travel."
2,Disapointing gun cases.,"The outer case is fine but the inside foam is not! It is hard to use the center tie down, scope is in the way. Also nothing for the end of the barrel, needed most when putting the rifle in the case."
4,Pretty good.,"This case is absolutly nothing facy, but it does the job. The case is simply just for transportation or locking it up in your house to simply keep away for children. This case will not stop ANY thief. But like I said just a simple case if you need one. Another plus is that I can perfectly fit, with no wiggle room but fits nice and smooth, a mossberg 590A1 and a H&R 12 gauge."
5,Great case for the money!,Great price on a great case that protects my competition rifles very well! I no longer need to worry about my rifle getting kicked or stepped on incidentally.
4,"Good case, don't expect it to hold every scoped gun though...","I would recommend this gun case: it's well made, inexpensive, and should hold just about any scoped gun. Just don't think it's gonna hold ALL guns/scope combos. I have no problem carrying my Colt AR-15 in it, so long as it has the red/green dot sight mounted on it. However, when i try to pack it with my 50mm scope mounted, it just barely doesn't fit: won't close completely. Oh well, it's easily unmounted and placed next to the gun in the case. The case has plenty of room to hold your gun and magazines, unmounted scopes, etc. Would definately recommend this buy to others based on the storage capacity."
4,Nice case for the money,I haven't used it for my trip yet (via airline) but it does seem like it will protect my rifle. Certainly a good case for the price.
2,"Just average quality, doesn't live up to ""made in USA"" standard.","Just received 2 of these cases for my 20 gauge slug gun and 300 wsm rifle. the outside case feels sturdy, the made in China straps feel sturdy as well. but the foams are very cheap looking and poorly assembled. and they don't seem to fit in the case quite well. There is a lot of space in the case that can't be utilized which is a waste. it is such a big case, and you can only put the gun in there. no room for other accessaries.If I were to buy another case, I would spend extra $$$ to get a better one."
5,Plano rifle case,"My friends showed me the case, It holds the rifle securely with velcro. It has room for the rifle while it is scoped. seals securely and the case will accomodate 2 padlocks."
3,too tight,"Dang things were too tight for me. I guess I'm bigger than I thought I was, but for some reason I had in mind that Dickies would be kind of loose and baggy. I have become fatter than my dear dad, so I gave them to him, and they fit him fine, but hilariously he said they were too long for his style.I guess if you are a thin youngster, get these in your size. If you are living large, get them in a larger size. If you were born before the Led Zeppelin came out, these might be too long for your taste."
3,Good,"The book is a bit beaten up, but it was pretty cheap so it is no big deal. I had, had an issue with my address coming up wrong so I contacted the seller through email and received a quick reply and correction to my address so I was able to receive my book in due time."
5,Relaxing soothing Music,I really like this kind of music with a glass of wine to help me into a comfortable night's sleep.!!! But in the end it's the soft music that lulls me into a good slumber.!!! :)
2,Whats the story with Oasis?,I am sorry but I have to disagree with most of the reviews on here. This album sounds forced with no sonic texture its plain RUBISH! I have been listening to Oasis since late 1994 and in that time I can honestly say this album was a Big Fat let down stay away from this one.
2,Nothing Special,"Everytime this band comes out with a new album I try really hard to like it. And here I am again, trying really hard to enjoy ""Don't Believe the Truth"". After listening to it a few times around, there isn't a single song that really stands out and grabs your attention.The whole album is basically Oasis' version of another era of music, mainly 60's rock. What's the Story Morning Glory kick-started a Brit-pop revolution, this one feels like it never even happened. There's nothing exciting, original, idealistic or inspiring in any of the songs and it feels like the band just got together to make some cash and help support their rock'n'roll lifestyle.I'm disappointed again."
5,"Great, Amazing, No Words Can Describe It!","Excellent CD, Oasis at their best. OK, it's not the same as their first two or three, but it is awesome.Highlights: Turn Up The Sun, Mucky Fingers, Lyla, Love Like A Bomb, The Importance Of Being Idle, The Meaning Of Soul, Guess God Think's Im Abel, Part Of The Queue, Keep The Dream Alive, A Bell Will Ring, Let There Be Love.Oh Wait, is that every song? YES."
1,Won't work with iPod or other players,"Bought the dualdisc version and while the album is really great, actually the best Oasis album since 'Morning Glory', this version won't work with MP3 players, since it won't load on the computer. Only the DVD side, which won't allow you to transfer the tracks to your player."
1,Mad Fer It?? Believe this truth,"'Member the days when the cats were Mad Fer It, mates? Those days are long over, it seems. Liam's croaky voice has been busted up by too much booze and too many cigarettes, while his flat-faced brother, poor Noel, couldn't write a decent guitar lick these days if John Lennon's ghost appeared in his bedroom with hand-written instructions.Poor Oasis. They were once so great. This new record sounds straight outta 1965, for old fogies only. That's too bad. I remember when these guys were armed (with guitars) and dangerous (with attitude). Now they are just middle-aged millionaires who make British compatriots Def Leppard look young and edgy.What happened, guys?? Let's bring it back to what it was. Maybe one day soon the cats'll be Mad Fer It once again.P.S. IS BLUR REUNITING??????????????"
1,Complete Rubbish,"I wouldn't buy this album if it was free. First of all, the band itself isn't that great. I just don't get the fuss about them. Every song sounds the same. Secondly, Liam Gallagher is a total idiot. All he does is badmouth other bands (a lot better than his) because he obviously feels inadequate. Alex Kaparanos of Franz Ferdinand recently called him ""a neurotic schoolgirl"" and I couldn't agree more. Instead of talking trash about bands in order to try and sell more records, he should worry about trying to improve his own."
1,The worst ever!!,"Oasis were on a winner with Heathen Chemistry, this is the biggest peice of crap, its unbeleivable.To say that this is as the best since Definitley Maybe is joke!For cyring out loud, The Spice Girls have better albums than this!!Its ireedeemably bad and a joke and a half, how can people put down ""Standing on the shoulder of giants"" and ""Be here now"" as dissapointments and failures!!! They're both great albums!This does'nt even compare, its not even worthy of comparing, and Lyla is just disgusting.Goodbye Oasis, you never lost your diginity untiul now."
4,IT'S ALL IN THE STARS,"good side:Noel Gallagher let's other people showcase their songs which in turn are quite the highlights,Noel sings 3 and a half songs. strongest set of songs since the new line-up and now sober approach to living. Zak Starkey (Ringo Starr's son) is now drummer. very insightful bonus DVD. lyric sheetbad side:could use more band pictures, DVD could have been longer, Noel could have sang morestandout tracks:turn up the sun, the importance of being idle; guess God thinks i'm Abel; keep the dream alive; let there be love"
4,A Solid Album No Doubt,"Oasis have definitely come back from a slump. We all know Heathen Chemistry was horrendous, and coming into the new record, I was a bit apprehensive about it being as solid as the first three records (yeah, I said THREE, Be Here Now was good stuff). Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised at the versatility, yet also consistency in this album. Thankfully, Oasis have come into there own again as great song writers, and they STILL are great musicians. I really enjoyed the record, and how it brought back memories of the old days, while still not leaving me longing to pop in one of the old records in its place. It is a must-own for any Oasis fan."
4,Enough with the comparisons,"I've been listening to Oasis for a while now and it seems like every major review has either compared them to other bands or accused them of not being original. They are obviously influenced by other bands, but after so many great albums they have proven they deserve their fame. ""Lyla"", ""The importance of being idle"" and ""Let there be love"" are standout tracks and Oasis is continuing with the great sound they rediscovered on Heathen chemistry."
4,Oasis rockin'!,"This album many not blow you away on the first listen, but it could easily grow on you! It's definitely better than Heathen Chemistry, and may be the band's best album since Morning Glory! It sounds slightly different from any other Oasis albums, but it's still something that Oasis fans should appreciate. If you hate Oasis, then you won't like this album, but if you're an Oasis fan, then I definitely recommend this album for you!"
3,"Good, but not great","It took a few listens before I got used to the new Oasis. Oasis has done much better stuff previously to Don't Believe the Truth, but after a few listens, the cd did not seem as badly as it had before. Don't Believe the Truth is very different from Heathen Chemistry (their last album), but much better than Heathen was. Oasis fans may love this cd, but I doubt many others will.Recommendations: Lyla, Let There Be Love and Importance of Being Idle"
4,Oasis rock!,"This may not be Oasis' best album ever, but definitely better than Heathen Chemistry, and maybe even the best since (What's The Story) Morning Glory! Don't Believe The Truth may not blow you away on the first listen, but give it time. Listen to it some more, and it could easily grow on you! It might be slightly different than what you'd expect from Oasis, but it's still a great album and an improvement for the band!"
5,Don't Believe the Truth,"Yeah! The summer can begin! Great album, not one bad song, great guitar work, Oasis has outdone themselves. Feels like a real band album. Fans certainly couldn't be dissapointed, and now is the time for anyone who has resisted Oasis to give in. Have listened 3 times all the way through and love it."
4,Great album!,"Is it just me or did Oasis just keep getting better and better? I always thought the first two albums were a lit...tle....bit overrated, to be honest. I liked them initially but the poor audio and the hype was just too much. Other than Champaign Supernova, of course. Then they unleashed Heathen Chemistry and Don't Believe the Truth. I just finished listening to both for the first time. Like any Oasis album, they are spotty. But the high points are so darn good. I don't know why people dissed these guys after WTSMG. This is extremely high quality MODERN pop. I promise you will not walk away from either not wanting to hit replay. I know... I was surprised too."
3,Solid Effort,"I would give this 3 1/2 stars, if I was able to.I always allow some room for nostalgia, as that's a big part of Oasis (for me). My favorite tracks on this album are The Importance Of Being Idle and Part Of The Queue. 'Part of the Queue' is definately one of my favorite Oasis tracks to date, it's very different from their normal, and I wish they would go deeper in this direction. All in all, every track on this album is solid and worth a listen to.Keep in mind I don't listen to the radio and got this as a promo from the store I work at."
3,"Not rubbish, and not the greatest","This is certainly an enjoyable listen. I own all the major Oasis releases and like them all. However, the recordings that find there way into the CD player far more often when I am in that Britpop mood, are those by the band called Ocean Color Scene. A band that deserves to be at least as huge as Oasis. Mechanical Wonder and North Atlantic Drift are truelly deserving of 5 stars, and most of their rest at least a 4. So fans, give them a try, you will like it."
3,they are better than this!,"As an Oasis fan from way back, I eagerly anticipated this new album, especially after hearing ""Lyla"", which is, hands-down, a great song. Well, the rest of the CD leaves much to be desired, I am sorry to say. Another reviewer summed it up rather well when he said that they peaked in '95-'96; that sadly seems to be the case. ""Part of the Queue"" is also good, but other than that, I wasn't too impressed. A major flaw of the new CD is that it sounds and feels derivative, and often Beatles-esque. I don't like the Beatles and want to hear Oasis sounding like Oasis, not trying to sound like The Beatles. Anyway, there's always hope that their next CD will be better. By the way, if you're looking to buy a great rock CD, check out The Wallflowers' new one, ""Rebel, Sweetheart"". It rocks, and does not disappoint!"
2,All the hype for this,"If you are looking for an album as good as Definately Maybe then you should look elsewhere. This album, though it took so long, sounds rushed, half hearted and very patchy. Listening to it as a whole album it sounds like a bad compilation of outtakes, and when listening to the songs individually to pull out good points, it is a difficult task. It has a couple of singles on it but nothing more. Lyla is classic Oasis and made me rush to the shops to buy this album, but have decided to go back to The first 3 to try and reconvince myself how good this band actually are."
4,A Great Sixties Retrospective!!!,"Don`t Believe the Truth is a Great album, the Sixties sound in Every Song is Great, the masterpiece of the album is Noel's ""Importance of Being Idle"" and the Smash ""A Bell Will Ring"" and ""Love like a Bomb"" sounds great, good song by Liam"
5,The Oasis Revival,"Don't Believe the Truth is the revival of Oasis after their last two albums (Standing on the Shoulder of Giants and Heathen Chemistry). Even if Oasis take their sound farther than they used to do in thier biggest success What's the Story, it still sounds very ""Oasis"".The best tracks are: Lyla, A Bell Will Ring and Let There Be Love.If you were wishing for a good material by the Gallagher brothers, you must purchase this album"
4,It's GREAT,"I think sometimes folks buy albums expecting them to change the world on first listen. While the lead track is weak, don't let that frighten you -- the rest of the album is terrifically bouncy, melodic, and unapologetic. And it ROCKS.When was the last time you really cranked a new CD in your car or at home? You'll be doing that with ""Don't Believe The Truth"" before you get to the forth song. ""Ringin' A Bell"" is my favorite track so far."
5,a great album,"Like most of the oasis fans, i was eager to get a copy of this album on its release date. I've read good reviews about this album before it was released and it made me more excited. When finally i got my copy and started listening, instantly i got hooked. This is one album that i sometimes found myself doing nothing but just listening to the songs and still get satisfied. My dad and I are huge Beatles fans and and we both find most of the songs comparable to Beatles tunes. If the Beatles were get to pick one album that they can claim as their own, this is that album.I am also a big fan of Coldplay but I did not like their X&Y; album at all. They continue ripping their own songs. And Chris' vocals is starting to get tiring.Go and give this album a try."
1,The downward spiral continues,"First a disclaimer: I am a big Oasis fan, own every album, every single, so don't think i'm coming into this review as an Oasis hater...Now with that being said, this album can be summed up in one word; BORING. This continues the trend of the last two albums, with only three or four good songs per album.The only good songs on this cd are...LylaImportance of Being IdleLet There Be LoveEverything else sucks, it's boring, bland rubbish.Hey Noel, here's some advice1. Get Owen Morris back as your producer2. Do not EVER let Liam write another song3. Start doing coke again.Maybe then you will once again make great albums like Definitely Maybe, Morning Glory and Be Here Now."
3,Wake up guys!!!,"Why does Madonna seem more willing to experiment with music than Oasis? Why does Noel sound tired and bored in every interview since ""Standing on the shoulder of giants""? Why does he sound ashamed of ""Be here now"" when at least the band still had musical ambitions back then? Why put every guy in the band to write songs when it's evident they don't have a special talent for it (as Noel does)? Why has the magic gone? (that magic you can still hint only in the track ""Let there be love"" on this album).Why do they seem to put more effort in attacking other artists than in their own music?"
4,Turn Up the Sun,"Oasis are back with a new album. It is a solid effort that longtime fans will love and non-Oasis fans will dismiss. There are some really great tracks on Don't Believe the Truth. The opening track is a standard Oasis arena rocker. The second song ""Mucky Fingers"" has all the markings of a strong protest anthem. Who said Oasis' music doesn't say anything? In many ways Don't Believe the Truth has the most new Oasis moments since What's the Story Morning Glory.Whatever anyone thinks of Oasis they are one of the most influential guitar bands of the last ten years. The band proves with this album they are not going away. While Don't Believe the Truth does not rise to the level of Oasis' first two albums, it's their best effort since What's the Story Morning Glory?"
5,A little PATIENCE and you'll be hooked!,"As a die-hard Oasis fan, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't somewhat 'disappointed' when I first played the album. Simply put, it wasn't a-typical Oasis material of years past. HOWEVER, I'm a firm believe in giving any album a 'shot' and I did just that.After about the 8th-go-around, I was hooked. Not only did I find myself ""chair-dancing"" to the slightly different beat of a familiar band, but I also came to understand and APPRECIATE the older and mature Oasis.I recommend that you spend the extra $2 and buy the DualDisc; then you can watch the interview featurette before listening to the album so you know what to expect. Then watch it again after listening to it several times and I think you'll be posting at least 4+ stars too! Happy listening and cheers to the Best Rock & Roll Band in the World!"
2,through the motions,"Once again - dissapointed I'm afraid! I hate to say it cos I love(d) Oasis.This album is too cheesy, too clompy (whatever that means!!!) and not what a top band should be producing. Lyla?!? Its so crap I cant believe it! Oasis are going through the motions and not moving very well at all.The Lennon influence on the vocals is extremely annoying (nothing against Lennon of course - I just hate the copied delivery) - what happened to the angry lead vocalist in Morning Glory? What the hell happened to songs like Some Might Say, Cast No Shadow...Oasis are still on the shelf way after their sell-by-date. I hate to say this!!!The live tour will no doubt be fantastic - thats only cos of the classics.Coldplay have royally kicked their ass with X & Y."
5,BEST BAND IN THE WORLD,"Who cares what anyone else says. Oasis fans know this is true.The reason Oasis are not well know in America anymore is because they don't release singles here, which is probly why their new material is not played on the radio.This Album is easily their best since BE HERE NOW.It is pointless to even write a detailed review because TRUE OASIS FANS like most who are reading this already know how great it is.Buy it, don't buy it, it doesn't matter. Oasis are already rich beyond belief and we are too because we get to own on CD, the brilliance of the BEST BAND IN THE WORLD."
2,Oasis have dried up.,"I was excited for the new Oasis album, to come out. Upon hearing the record, my hopes for a great album weredashed as ""Don't Believe the Truth"" is truly an uninspiring disc. Lazy arrangements, songs that don't seemfinished, eg. The Meaning of Soul, dominate this record. There are a two bright spots, Andy and Gem's ""Keep TheDream Alive"", and ""A Bell Will Ring"", give this collection some meaning. Other than that, this sounds like a groupgoing through the motions, void of any creativity and magic of earlier records."
1,THE CONSISTANT ALBUM CONCEPT FOR OASIS,"Step 1) Try to make a Beatles album, any originality in thought needs to immediately be terminatedStep 2) Fail miserably at making an album that sounds like a Beatles album (the fact is any member of the Beatles was a better songwriter than the combined members of Oasis)Step 3) Release the annoying first single that tries to sound like a Beatles songStep 4) Tell everyone you're better than the BeatlesStep 5) Have Radiohead release an album and make you look patheticStep 6) Repeat steps 1-5"
1,Please disband and stop,"You will never be the greatest rock and roll band in the world...however, I did really like that songbird song from your last album. Maybe if you made more catchy songs liek that, you could be the greatest rock and roll band."
1,Load of garbage.,"What the heak is this junk, how did Oasis ever seriously think anyone would want to listen to this waffle.There is'nt one decent song, and album by album they keep going in the wrong direction, it all started with ""Be Here Now"", and they've just been getting worse and worse since. They hit rock bottom with Heathen Chemistry despite that album shining with a few glimmers of hope.Time will only tell whether they'll ever get better or get worse."
1,Crap... a sad decline from the once-great Brothers Arrogant,"This album is so bad it's beyond words. Honest to God, being an avid fan of there Definitely Maybe and Morning Glory albums, I tried as hard as I could to accept this new release, but I simply couldn't force myself to listen to it more than twice. It is horrid & pathetic, and obviously, these lads from Manchester should quit while they further tarnish their jaded reputation."
1,Not worth buying,"This album is way off what I expect from this legendary group.The problem is, they have set the bar very high. (What's The Story) Morning Glory is possibly the greatest rock album ever. Be Here Now and Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants are also a superb albums.But there is not one song on Don't Believe The Truth that I consider an anthem. Don't get your hopes up!"
2,hmm....,"I'm one of the biggest Oasis fans out there. I own all the albums, all the singles, and all the DVDs. I can play all their popular songs on guitar. I've even got tickets for their tour this fall.BUT, this new CD does not do it for me. Call me old school, but I'm not liking this new Oasis. I think the druming is simplistic... same repetitive beat beat beat in Lyla and Mucky Fingers. The only good song is Let There Be Love. I certainly hope the new B-sides of this album sound like the old Oasis.Now, I'm kinda disappointed in their fall concert. Because I know the majority of the songs will probably be from this new album."
4,Good to have Oasis back...,"After slipping into near-obscurity with their lamentable ""Heathen Chemistry"", it's good to have Oasis back on the much-improved ""Don't Believe the Truth.""Is it as good as their earlier, triumphant works such as ""Definitely Maybe"", ""Be Here Now"", or even ""Standing on the Shoulder of Giants"" ? No.But, unlike some of their works, it is *consistent*.The album, as I've listened to it, has neither highs nor lows, rather it is chock-filled with above average songs from the opening, enjoyable ""Turn Up the Sun"" to the closing (not-quite eternally memorable, standard Oasis ballad) ""Let there be Love.""Will this CD be dulled by consistent play, as was ""Definitely Maybe"" ? NO, I don't think so. But it will be listened to, and not immediately be relegated to the dust-bin (as was ""Heathen Chemistry"").Bottom line: Oasis fans, gobble it up. It's worth a listen. It will, at the least, rekindle your love of their best works. And that's more than most bands can claim."
4,from an Oasis partisan...,"There's been a lot of talk that this is the third best Oasis album (after DM and WTSMG, of course). I know what they mean; none of the songs on this album approach the headiness of ""Live Forever"", ""Supersonic"", ""Don't Look Back..."", or any of the other standouts from their first two albums, so it's hard for this album to measure up.I do believe that this is the most even Oasis album from start to finish, however. There aren't any obvious thowaways/clunkers and I've found myself wanting to go back and listen to the ENTIRE album over and over. It's hard to name a favorite track or weakest track right now. Overall solid album."
5,amazing!,"i love this cd and its one of my fav oasis albums up to date. Every song on the album is top notch. My personal favorites are turn up the sun, lyla , Part Of The Queue and love like a bomb but every track is amazing like I said. It's the best new album I've heard in awhile."
5,Album of the year!,"From the first time I popped it in my cd player to the last time I heard it which was last night, it still clicks on me and never gets old. This is by far the best album of the year and one of my favorites of all times, Rock n Roll like it should always be. Reason why is not a 5 star album cos people don't want to accept that Oasis is still up there because of their cocky attitudes, but it's all about the music. Don't care for them, just their tunes."
4,Best Ever?,"After ""What's the Story"" I felt the boys had lost the plot and were a two album band. But not so! I think as a complete album ""Don't Believe"" is probably their best work. True there are no really outstanding tracks like Chapagne Supernova or the massive Wonderwall but every one is excellent. I particularly like Mucky Fingers and Let there be love. Like their first two albums it does have a Beatlesish sound to it, but so what! It's still good. Anyway if you liked Definitely Maybe and What's the Story you will love this, and if you didn't why are you reading this review?By the way if you like these guys listen to a bit of Paul Weller. He didn't cross over to the US really, but in England he is the grandaddy that made bands like Oasis possible (and he is better)."
4,From NFL's golden era.,"These films are from the days when the coach wore a suit and a topcoat, and the players wore grass stains."
4,Blankness of white environment makes you confront yourself,"Very impressive"" Narrow Road to the Deep South."" She shows the parallel process of adjusting to the environment and travelling down inside herself exceptionally well. The humour and lack of pomposity about the process is engaging as is the stealthy accumulation of historical detail on a subjective frame...Wanted to meet her and find out how the process had actually worked on her!"
1,Not the best book,"The book goes on and on about Scott and guys who went to the Antarctic about a zillion years ago. The author continually says bad things about everyone she meets, then tells how they all loved her and threw parties for her. She marginalizes or even ignores the work of the people she meets. I read the book to learn about Antarctica, not about her. Having read the book, I know more about her and no more about Antarctica than I did before I read the book. Forget this book; don't bother reading it unless you're one of Sara's ""friends"" (be careful of the back-stabbing)."
2,sara cognita,"This is an account of travels within Sara Wheeler's mind, while her body just happened to be in Antarctica at the time. You will enjoy this book if you accept it as literature with frosty landscapes in the background.You will dislike this book if you want to learn anything at all about the place ... it will still be largely incognita when you have finished reading.Wheeler is part of the stereotype of female travel writers who are obsessed with the effect places and people have upon themselves; compare males who minutely describe the scenes and processes of travel.Antarctica seems to have an effect on its visitors which Wheeler adequately conveys. But you won't learn anything at all about why people work there, or what they have discovered."
3,"Good read, but ......","Fittingly, Ms. Wheeler seems enraptured by the splendour of great white south. Most who have been to the Arctic or Antarctic has suffered the same fate. However she seems a bit full of herself at times, and this distracts noticably from the book. There were times when I thought to myself that she was in Antarctica for social reasons (to ""party""!) rather than to discover the essence of the place.Still, if you can ignore the aren't-I-great parts, it makes for a good read."
5,Interesting compelling reading,"Sara's research on the history, people, stories and culture of Antarctica make for a great complement to her travel experiences through this continent. Buy it..."
2,"At times tedious, this modern visit informs.","If the reader has little exposure to the writings of the original polar explorers, then the frequent asides to create a context for Sara Wheeler's observations is probably informative. I found the historical asides to interrupt the flow of Ms. Wheeler's thoughts and feelings upon being exposed to the immensity of Antarctica for the first time."
4,Great read,"I happened upon a free reviewer copy of this book at work, took it home and let it sit for a while, then read it on a summer camping trip. Wonderful stuff and makes me want all the more to visit Antarctica."
4,Ventures More Heavy,"This is the ventures. They do there music here a little bit more heavy. Walk Don't Run is done more here to sound heavy and more hard, not a light feeling to it. I liked this Album 20 years ago and still like it now."
3,"Worthy of being read....but not fully representative of ""us""","Professor Cox has, indeed, contributed to the ever-widening area of Pentecostal/charismatic studies with ""FIRE FROM HEAVEN."" His breadth of experience, reflected in the book, is to be admired; but it wasn't wide enough. As a life-long Pentecostal, I could identify with only a few parts of his ""experience"" and have wondered why the ""main-line"" denominations weren't included more than they actually were. Why did Cox not visit Times Square Church, or the Brooklyn Tabernacle, or any number of other biblically-sound congregations, and see what effective Pentecostal churches are all about? After reading, and re-reading the book, I felt that I was getting a treatise on the ""fringe"" elements of Pentecostalism, and not the ""mainstream."" It is worthy of being read...but not very balanced,in the light of world-wide Pentecostalism."
1,"Enjoyable read, not really academic","This book is an odd mixture of personal narrative and some history. This may be an important point, since from a research perspective its practically useless. On the flip side, this makes the book an easy, smooth read. Its weird that the title seems to present this as some kind of important academic work, it reads more like the memoir of a religion professor, without the footnotes and research that would make it academically useful."
4,Fire From Heaven,"Although I am not very far into the book, it is well written and keeps your interest. I am looking forward to finishing this book. I would highly recommend it. Others in my class like this book as well."
5,Incredibly Wise and Informative!,Annie Besant is an inspiration. She writes cogently and cohesively in an easy to read manner about a subject we all seem to need - self-mastery. It can be done - we are what we think about. This is an excellent book for anyone dedicated to the spiritual path and the discipline it requires.
5,An absolute classic,This book has been a favorite for twenty-five years. It's been around a long time but it's message is still relavent to out times.
5,"You need this before you meet the ""real world""","Very good. Author isn't only describing ""how to debug Perl programs"" but he'smainly concerned in ""how to write Perl programs that you won't need to debug"" - thissounds better, right ? A ""hands-on"" developer experience brought by someone who obviouslystepped on most of errors people may step and trying to warn you before you're doingthe same.If ""Programming Perl"" is about ""Perl"", this book is about ""real-world-Perl"" and .. hey ..those things aren't the same, as you should know (you *will* after reading the book).Thank you, Martin !"
5,It's about time...,"After a countless number of Perl books have been published, not much has been published like this book. The Learning Perl books are great, but learning the syntax isn't always the needed information to programmers. This book is different in that it focuses on some of the quirky odd things that you may run into programming. After designing in Perl for 3 years, I still run into times the code does not work the way I thought it would (maybe from thinking in C, Java, etc terms) and need a book of quirks instead a book of syntax. Finally, a book about how Perl behaves (or misbehaves). Great work. Long live Perl."
3,"awful narration, poor understanding","I was very interested in this series after spending 12 years of my life as a long hauler. Aside from the pseudo dramatic overdone narration it is apparent that the producers know very little about the occupation of trucking. True, it is dangerous, but the real problems that some of these guys faced had more to do with their ineptness in driving & understanding the equipment they use on a daily basis. The idea that someone with years & years of experience can't down shift without mashing every gear is simply unbelievable. The arrogance of the ""Polar Bear"" in his treatment of his hired drivers & lack of willingness to accept responsibility for his own behavior destroys his own credibility. The only driver who knew what he was doing & did it well was is Jay. To bad we don't have more like that. For all of the critical comments, I did enjoy the show but please get another narrator! aka Tenderfoot p.s. I was a lady driver & pulled flatbed with my own truck!"
5,Love it even more!!!!,"Again, i just marvel in the risks these men and women take every time they get in a big rig! I love to watch the drama they face every day. It is very entertaining as well! I hope they come out with more and more episodes every year! I will look forward to seeing them every weekend!"
4,IRT 2,I love the Ice Road truckers series that I am collecting all of the series. I have series 1-3 so far and I absolutely love them
4,IRT Returns to Canada,"Season two is my least favorite. Too much time is spent on bad attitudes or childish activities. I like the IRT series for the whine of truck engines, not the whine of drivers. It's still interesting and entertaining as truckers take giant loads onto river and sea ice. Just keep your remote handy so you can fast forward through the out-of-cab foolishness."
2,over and over again,"Season one was much better,too many scenes repeated,sub-titles flashed on and off faster than you could read them and too much emphasis on ""Rick the Wreck"" and his constant whining.These drivers all seem to hate each other and the show seems to focus on that.Alex seems to be the only one with a sense of humor and a good attitude.Too bad he is ill and hope he has a full recovery.I will pass if there is a season three!!"
1,Design Flaw,"I bought this doorbell button at Home Depot (they sell the exact same thing at Lowes under a different name) It looks great and by looks alone it was exactly what I was looking for, however I returned it because the two plastic pieces that are used to mount it are poorly designed. The directions say they are supposed to ""snap"" together... no such luck. I went back to Home Depot and exchanged it with hopes that maybe I just had a bad one... I guess the Heath Zenith quality-control person was out sick that day because neither one worked.If you're not willing to spend $30 for this ($25 for the button and $5 for super-glue to fix what Heath Zenith didn't), you might be better off looking for another doorbell and another brand.Pros: Looks greatCons: Doesn't work - I guess you pay extra for thatSorry Heath Zenith... this was a waste of my time and money."
1,Could be so much better,"Housing is made very well, has a nice weight to it, but that does not apply to the base of the button which is made of plastic. If installed on an uneven surface or flashing that bends, the notch and a tab on the base do not snap together as they should. A redesign of the unit that eliminated the troublesome base would make this a very nice doorbell button."
3,Worked great for 5 years,"I noticed that my doorbell wasn't lit up anymore, so I tried to figure out if there was a cell battery or something I could change out to make it work (since the light is my favorite part) - well once I took it off and tried snapping it back, the plastic connector broke off : ( . Lasted 5 years without an issue, and if I hadn't messed with it, it would've lasted forever (without the light though)."
5,Wonderful gift or anyone in need of a map for the journey,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who is seeking the true nature of the Father. Max has done it again, his words are clear, his meaning concise...to the point. This isn't simply a book for a graduating teen, it is a book for anyone in need of a roadmap for the journey. I read this book in the course of an hour today, at the mall, while my husband Christmas shopped for me, and I walked away renewed. You will go back to this book again and again!"
3,Surprised,Differnt than most of Lucado's books. More like a daily reading than a book that can be taught in a Sunday school class setting
2,what a joke,"I totally thought this lamp was beautiful,which it is-BUT if this lamp is glass and not plastic I'm a monkeys uncle,come on how mis leading. Also I know the colors can differ but really lacks color."
1,piano wise,"I remember Liberace from when he had his tv program in the 50's...but his piano CD I ordered was sooo pathetic I just cannot play it...I hated it...and I dont quite know why...since I used to like his playing...I am sorry I ordered it, I put it out in the garbage but I noticed someone picked it up ( along with a few other cd's etc)...I wished him good luck with that...regards, Janet Pollock"
2,Windows 2000 came later,"I'm very disappointed: I've bought this book hoping to find the advertized help about Win2K policies but all I've got about this subject is ONE chapter, 30 pages or so over 500 in the book. It looks like this chapter has been put into the book after the book itself was already done: infact, except for the specific chapter, the book always talks about the forthcoming Windows NT 5 operating system... Don't call it Windows 2000 System Policies, call it Windows 9X and NT with a quick and incomplete look to Windows 2000."
2,Harve Benard Women's Plus Size Stretch Pant,"Product description did not say that pants were 18Long. Since I am 5'1"", they are unwearable and will have to be sent back."
3,"Unlikeable characters, but good lessons learned.","I didn't feel like the main character was very likeable, but I don't regret reading the story. It was good in that she (Samantha) had her priorities straightened out by the end & learned how to become a better friend and nicer person.Doesn't compare to other books by this author - if this is your first attempt at reading Rallison, try some others before making a judgement about her. I HIGHLY recommendMy Fair GodmotherandIt's a Mall World After All."
4,Delightful Read,"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School is a great teen book. It's a story about Samantha, a popular, head cheerleader, who decides to run for class president after she bombs her SATs. Also, her ex-boyfriend/coworker makes a bet with her that she can't go two weeks without insulting someone.Janette Rallison creates realistic teen dialogue and situations that teens can actually relate to. This book also shows how teens think and rethink through situations to try and find the correct solution. The twists and turns of the story are just enough to keep readers interested and guessing until the very end. In the end, All's Fair in Love, War, and High School is a delightful, quick read for anyone who wants to escape the drama of their own life."
3,Cute fluff,"This is a cute romance, but nothing really to make it stand out for me. I liked the play between Samantha and Logan and the idea of the ""no-insults"" bet. I think this book would be perfect for about middle school age girls looking for a ""clean"" romance. There's nothing objectionable in this book and overall a cute story."
4,"I'd say all is far in love, war, and highschool!","I read this book a week ago. I loved it! I'm 14 and I'll be a freshman next year. Samantha, the junior in high school girl in the book, had it pretty hard in the very beggining. Even throughout the book she was so unlucky things just kept disagreeing with her. The author also turns things around in the end and even though things don't necessarily end up her way, she makes new friends and finds out that some of her bad thoughts that she had about people were completely wrong.I hope that when I'm a freshman, I don't have it nearly as bad as she did. I would recommend this book to kids in middle school and freshmen. Even though some of it is repeditive, some parts are more interesting than not."
5,Samantha is real and not perfect but you can't help cheer for her!,"This is one of my favorite stories by Janette Rallison. I reread it almost every year. I'm not sure why the character Samantha calls to me but I really enjoy her trials. You think, she's popular and a cheerleader so she must have it all, so why do I care about her? But you do care about her and want her to succeed. She bombs the SAT and the only way to make it to college is to ""beef up"" her resume and run for student body president. I love the bet she makes with Logan that she wont say anything bad about people for two weeks. (That is really hard to do, have you tried it?) She is not perfect and makes a fool of herself plenty. But you appreciate her trying to better herself and in the end you want only great things for her. Samantha struggles with who her true friends are; finding true love isn't where you'd think; and doing the right thing is harder than it seems."
4,I remember this book,"I remember reading this book when I was in middle school. And I remember thinking how this is probably going to be another book about a cheerleader who is so use to getting anything she wants and when she doesn't get what she wants, all hell breaks loose. Well, I was kind of right. And I was kind of wrong. Samantha is not your typical rah-rah, perky cheerleader. She is the perfect blend of sugar and spice and everything nice. She discovers that her ego is getting in her way. The author did a fantastic job telling a story and getting kids to realize that not everything centers around them."
5,Brazalian Adventure,"The acting in this movie is superb! If you dont mind the nudity of the actors and also the boys, then this is a fantastic movie. It is well-acted and tells a very nice story about the indians and the missionarys that bring the message to them."
4,"Mmmm Mmm, Tom Berenger",Great film. Worth watching alone to see Tom Berenger as mercenary (pre-bowl haircut.)
2,At Play in the Fields of the Lord,"I gave it a low rating because we were not able to change the sub titles to english.Unfortunately this is an American Movie, but do not sell an English version, though the talking is in English.I am just sad that you do not have the movie for sale in America."
3,Illusions of the white man,"After watching this movie it made me more aware that the so called civilization of 'primitive' cultures is generally more destructive than helpful.It showed how we have to make everything our way - but it also shows that people who choose to live among different cultures in understanding get farther.But to end all scenes is when Kathy Bates has a nervous break down and dances around naked, covered in mud and shaking palm branches - as serious as I take the movie this particular scene has me rolling in laughter!"
3,Mixed,"This film is slow and long, but I was in a patient mood when I saw it, so liked it, and thought there was a lot of worth in it. In a different mood, I would have been checking my watch all the time (as someone I saw it with did). It's not great, but its fitfully good."
3,Great While It Lasted,"This was a great printer. Great print quality and a good copier/scanner too. Biggest Con was that it had no document feeder. I purchased it in 2007. Now 2012, I've had the printer 4 1/2 years, but alas, its power supply died. There are ALOT of comments and questions on FixYa.com etc., regarding this printer with the power supply dying, and/or the printer just stops working. Thankfully for many, a common fix is to disconnect all power from the printer, let it sit for 30 minutes, then power it back on. For the rest of us, its the power supply. This printer is now discontinued, so to find a Canon K30271 AC Power supply has really been a challenge. I'll be calling Canon to see if they have one; but if not, my sweet MP810 is off to e-cycle. In the meantime, I've purchased an HP OfficeJet 8600 Premium and if the Canon can be repaired, I'll use it for a backup."
2,Died... On a self-destruct logic board,"Until the logic board went and self-destructed, it was doing well. I am very upset with Canon and its short-lived circuitry."
2,Great until it DIED,"I bought this printer about 2 years ago. Up until tonight it has printed great. I would say that I didn't even come close to printing 500 pages with this printer in that time. Probably much less. I replaced the ink once, relatively recently.Tonight, I print one page. It turns off and that's all she wrote. Nothing. Won't turn on anymore. tried everything I know to get it back to life.2 stars, sorry Canon you'll have to do better than 2 years. My old HP lasted 10. My Samsung lasted 5. I'll try Kodak next. What a bummer."
5,Great! Way more printer than we need!,This is a great printer...way more than we need or will begin to understand...but we are very happy with the quality and how easy it is to use. I would buy again!
5,good product,works great - copier good quality and quick - prints cleaning - easy install with mac - better than some hp printer i've had
1,Buyer Beware: Cartridge scam,"Seriously: watch out. This monster has proprietary cartridges that are verified via microchip. Fine. But the bigger problem is that the microchips tend to malfunction. When they do, and the printer can't recognize its cartridges, it shuts down completely--no printing, but also no scanning!!! Just appalling. I'm sending mine back asap. Do a google search to confirm this is a widespread problem, if you're skeptical."
2,Not what I expected,The printer works good--quick. Scanner is good. The colors are not vibrant though. Everything is dull. We have tried a variety of papers and nothing seems to make any of the colors pop. We are considering looking into a laser printer instead.
4,Great scanning and printing quality,"Overlooking the massive size of this printer and the lack of an auto 4x6 tray, this printer is awesome. Very pleased with this purchase."
1,Refurbished but not tested?,"I received the printer with a broken ink cartridge in the box, that should have been the first clue. Printer would not get past the set up returning an error about the ""scan lock"". Makes me wonder if they actually tested the printer before sending it back out again. If it hadn't been for the easy return policy I would have been very upset. Ended up buying a brand new Canon MP610 and had it up and running in a few minutes, very happy with it."
4,All in One Photo Printer,I have not used it too much and am still exploring it. The CD with all the software demands lots of memory on the computer but the quality of the printing (photos) and text and the scanning seems very good. It is fairly large but seems to be well worth the money.
3,ok for the money,It's a nice case... room for 4 or 5 guns... the plastic feels a bit cheap to me and the lid is often hard to get linned up to close... but other than that i like it
5,Like It.,Holds my all my stuff in place and looks like it will last. Good product and seems tough enough for the field and travel.
4,Not bad,"Not a bad case, I bought a few to move my glass pieces around in. If your buying for glass, you'll need a thick extra insert to hold everything very still. Its a tiny bit flimsy but so far nothing has cracked or broken (about 8 months old). Not bad for the price."
3,a little demented,"My boyfriend has this on VHS and actually made me sit there and watch it with him. I just bought the movie for him in DVD format for Christmas. For some parts of the movie there just are no words to describe what's going on. Interspecies sex, drugs and murder...I guess it has something for everyone! It's definitely a movie that everyone over the age of 18 needs to see at least once."
4,"Vile, Vulgar and Funny","""Meet the Feebles"" is one of the most disgusting movies of all time, but this is the charm of the movie. It repulses the viewer while at the same time making the average person laugh at its filthiness. My only complaint is that the movie is slugish in several spots and often gets caught in a web of problems because of this, but overall it is a must see."
3,Uh......,"Hell, I'll say one thing. There's nothing else like it. I've heard it described as ""Fraggle Rock meets Boogie Nights."" 'Nuff said."
2,Meet the Feebles,"The transfer quality of this disk is extremely poor. I was shocked to see something look this bad on dvd. The package is bare bones, with no indication of sound mix or size format. I would say poor mono for sound and the disk is full frame.Had I known the package would be of this quality I would have waited for a larger label to pick up the rights to press this disk."
2,More bad than good,"Meet The Feebles is to the Muppet Show as Mickey the Rat is to cartoons. Another way to put it is the Muppet Show on Acid. There really are some funny bits in the movie, especially the flash back scene and the end sequence. For the casual movie watch this probably ain't your thing. For peopel interested in the work of Peter Jackson or can suffer through the bad for the good, pick it up."
4,Sick and Twisted,"If you enjoy South Park, or Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation, or just got sick of Jim Henson's muppets, then check out this sick puppy of a movie. Often described as ""the Muppets on acid"", this is a take-off on all those smarmy kiddie movies.These puppets are nasty. They are greedy, venal, corrupt, dissolute characters. It's a film-noir, with all the worst human vices on display. Like Jackson's other movie Dead Alive, it combines humor and horror. This is midnight cinema at its best."
2,what the [] is this !!!,i dont really know how everyone can think this is such a good movie. i liked Dead Alive and i am about to watch bad taste but this movie is incredibly boring. i gave it two stars because i thought the movie had an intresting concept but it just didnt cut it. i fell asleep in the first hour of the film and just dont understAND WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. IT DID HAVE SOME INTRESTING LINES IN IT THAT I THOUGHT WERE FUNNY THOUGH.P.S. the dvd extras are worse than the movie!!!
2,Muppets on crack,"Dead Alive director Peter Jackson directs his 2 second film after his first film Bad Taste. The movie is sick and disgusting but at times hilarious that its hailed as the muppets on crack but the humor seems copied from a South Park episode and the movie gets quite disgusting(Showing scenes filled with drugs,sex,or gore) and the muppet-like characters are nasty and the whole movie fills like your watching 2 hours of odd cinema from the director of Dead Alive. The funny parts are when the frog has flashbacks of his Vietnam duty or when the fly gets flushed down a toilet and they said he wanted to be a journalist and the only thing left behind was a journal floating around a toilet. The sick parts are the rat making porno in the basement and when the rabbit is popping his herpes and brown pus shoots on the mirror.Please rent but do not buy because you do something better with your time or money."
1,Only for those with an odd mind,This is like the muppets on acid. I think the average person would not enjoy this movie. I found it odd and did not enjoy it.I am a fan of peter jackson and I did like dead alive.The puppets are well done and the music is appropriate. Maybe this is much funnier if you are under the influence of something...
3,"Excellent concept, but somewhat slow","I thought Jackson's movie had an extremely creative idea with Meet the Feebles but it gets long and drawn out in areas. Just as soon as it gets a tad boring though, Jackson throws something in to churn your stomach. Funny, creative, sick; what the hell go see it."
3,One of The Most Grotesque Films of All Time,"Inter-specie sex, animals behind the scenes of porno, animals using and dealing cocaine, and sort of a parody of The Muppets. This film goes beyond the limit of being grotesque to a level of far from the extentence of good nature, but still this movie isn't that bad. Maybe worth Saturday afternoon or so."
4,"Not for everyone, but if your that one, MASTERPIECE!","Meet the Feebles can, to some, be considered a study in everything that is wrong with society today. Date rape, suicide, drug abuse, social disease, all of these hard topics are addressed and dumped upon Peter Jacksons morbid muppets. But the intelligent viewer will realize Feebles is meant to enjoy, THEY ARE JUST PUPPETS!!"
5,"For those offended, Lighten Up.","Anyone who gave this movie a terrible review should have not bothered watching it at all. What were you expecting, Fraggle Rock? Peter Jackson is a genius at combining humor with sick, disgusting visuals. In fact his images are so twisted, you kind of have to laugh along with him. He manages to make those ugly puppets seem completely human by giving them real feelings and emotions, not all of which are pleasant. But it's the absurdity of the situations that makes it all come together. You can't take this movie too seriously. It's a goof people! So quit your complaining and enjoy the madness."
2,3 stars for the movie....,"....1 star for the DVD transfer=2 stars overall.Mostly vivid, interesting movie is hindered by the poor quality print schlepped onto DVD (but helped by the bargain price!). There is nothing great here, folks, but it probably will keep the average fan of ecclectic films awake to the end. For uniqueness alone, it deserves a viewing by those who enjoy unusual films. ""Meet the Feebles"" is to ""The Muppets"" what ""Fritz the Cat"" is to ""Bambi""!"
3,pretty funny,"I was expecting alot, and got some but not all. This movie is sort of funny, you must look past the boring main character and overlook the semi grainy video and find the humor in porn partaking puppets, and believe me its not that hard. Now don't think that the film quality is totally shot, it just seems too dark at times, but it just puts a little damper on what seems like a hilarious idea."
4,Sense of proportion,"This is basically a fun movie. If you find the Muppets just too 'nice' (Not to knock Jim Henson and crew and their creation, but one cannot live on sugar alone), then this movie is an excellent counter-balance. Try seeing it as one of the 'Behind the Scenes' or Entertainment TV pieces as we'd really like to see them turn out.Aside from the main jokes, there are funny little sidelights scattered throughout, for example every car seen is a Morris Minor ,including a stretched limo version (The Morris Minor was a small very low powered British car, very popular, or at least very common, in New Zealand in the 50's, 60's.As a New Zealander, it is sometimes puzzling to read others reviews of Peter Jackson, as though he is only allowed to make one sort of movie. Complex mixtures of drama, comedy, suspense, etc are what adults want from movies. Meet the Feebles won't go down as Peter Jackson's greatest film, but its a pretty good second film"
2,Jackson 10 Dead/Alive 0,"Peter Jackson's second feature, a Muppet/splatter movie, is delightfully made and excellent fun for anyone with a warped sense of humour who always found the Henson creations cloyingly wholesome. But the movie deserves better than this pitiful Dead/Alive issue which looks awful and ignores all the possibilities of DVD. My old VHS copy looks twice as good. Avoid this release but get the movie - when someone who knows what they're doing puts it out."
3,Stomach turning fun,"Not for everyone. Words can not describe the shock and horror I went through when I saw this for the first time four years ago. Now fast forward four years. I have seen movies that have offended me even more ""Forrest Gump"" and can honestly say that it's average at best. Yes, the outragous scenes are crazy and funny ""the nam flashback"", but I don't see myself watching this movie over and over again. Rent if you can, but don't buy."
2,Worst version on DVD,"I love this film, but don't buy this version. I saw 'Meet the Feebles' first at the cinema and owned it on VHS in Australia, and then on DVD from the UK. The US version is horribly dark and doesn't have the color of the original. If you really want to see a good version of this buy a Region free DVD player and buy it from anywhere but the US. The UK version is good."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"I saw the cover, and I thought to myself ""This is money! I HAVE to see this movie!"" That ended about 2 minutes in. I waited for the horrible torture to stop, but it didn't until I pressed the STOP button a few minutes in. Take a pass on this one and get something that doesn't wreak."
1,UNWATCHABLE,"I like sick humor more than anybody I know, but I shut this movie off after 30 minutes. It's the first movie I have EVER shut off. It's that bad. I kept waiting for something good to happen, but it just kept getting worse and worse. Please don't see this movie."
1,Do NOT watch this sick movie,"""Meet the feebles"" is the sickest movie I have ever been unfortunate enough to stumble upon. It is grotesque, and unbelievably bizarre. It turned my stomach. I strongly encourage you stay away from this bomb!"
2,I don't have enough time in my life for this dreck,"Whatever small value this film may hold, there are far better things you can be doing with your time. Why wallow in the base and disgusting when you don't have to? Is your time *really* better spent laughing at scatalogical ""humor"" than in contemplating more complex human emotions? Courage, honesty, nobility, love? Oh, but I've forgotten: those are much too serious and out of fashion.Do something else with your time, and your money. Read Socrates. Go find out what trees look like. Fall in love, even."
3,Very funny!,"Jackson's Meet the Feebles is a classic example of just how far one can go to offend. I'm surprised Troma didn't distribute this one, cause it certainly is at the level that Troma pride's itself on. It's like a John Water's puppet show, only with more gore. The plot is about an ensemble puppet cast that is trying to tie together loose ends as they get ready for the big Muppet Show like opening night. The humor is almost constant, and this is certainly not for children. The dvd offers nothing more than trailers for lame movies. The transfer is also lousy. Suggested only for fans of Jackson's work. Casual viewers may want to avoid this one."
5,Hell Hath No Fury Like A Hippo With A Machine gun,"If you have ever watched Lord of the Rings or King Kong, and wondered how Peter Jackson became the directing and producing genius he has become then you should definitely watch ""Meet the Feebles."" Loosely based on Jim Henson's Muppet Show, with a definitive adult vibe to the movie, this is one that kid's should definitely not watch. IMO, I like to call this one ""The Muppet's on Acid""....Sorry Jim, but if it weren't for you we would not have the genius of a Rat making snuff films in the basement, a Rabbit with ""the big one"", and an BDSM elephant that has a love child with a chicken. But you always were far ahead of your time. If you watch this movie and love it definitely thank Peter Jackson for making it and Jim Henson for the template."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"Okay, so it may not be the worst movie ever, but it definately ranks way down there. As far as I can see, it has only one redeeming segment. The scene where the alligator (or whatever it was) is having drug induced Vietnam flashbacks, that was pretty good. In fact, if that had been the only scene, I might have given this movie a good review. The rest of the movie was the sorriest piece of trash I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. I turned the movie off about half way through because it was so bad. I then watched the second half to see if it could get any worse... and it did. This movie was not funny, intelligent, thought provoking, or even mildly entertaining. The only emotions it got out of me was loathing and numbness."
3,"What a vile, disgusting, sick movie. I loved it!","I only gave this vile, disgusting, sick movie 3 stars not because of content, because this vile, disgusting, sick movie was a pisser on the level with John Water's Desperate Living. But the lack of features on the DVD (in fact the movie is one big chapter, so if you turn off the film in the middle to go to the bathroom, br prepared to watch the whole thing from scratch) and the poor transfer brought down my rating (hey what do you expect for 11 bucks). But don't let that stop you from watching Meet the Feebles, a vile, disgusting, sick and freakin funny movie."
5,The Best of Sick and Twisted,"Have you ever noticed how beautiful the lighting is in this toilet?Better than any B-movie, and without an annoying 'star' to get in the way!! All the things you ever thought about going wrong behind the scenes at the Muppet Shows!Puppets aren't for just for kids!"
4,Where bizarre and macabre meet childrens' programming,"On the surface, this is a puppet show. Imagine if you will the muppets AFTER a performance. Now imagine the Muppets cast as the dregs of society: the addicts, the perverse, the violent, and the criminal to name a few. Now you have a small inkling of what you are in store for when you sit down to a cozy fire-side viewing of Meet the Feebles. Peter Jackson takes a happy concept and upends it, defiles it, then renders it into pure genius. A recommendation to anyone who is sentient and able to see."
2,Bad video quality,"This movie is great, I would rate it about 4 to 4.5 stars. This review, at two stars, is about the DVD release from ""Substance"".The DVD is 4:3 full screen, cropping the movie's original aspect ratio of 1.78:1. There are no extras on this DVD, barely even a menu. The video looks like it has been taken from a second-generation VHS tape. The colors are bleeding and are overly saturated. Everything looks mushy.I'm not sure why they did not do this right. The very next DVD in their lineup, Peter Jackson's ""Bad Taste"", looks great. It has a crisp 1.66:1 aspect ratio image in an anamorphic frame, and it contains a 25 minute making-of featurette. Why could they not give this Peter Jackson movie the same treatment?"
2,yawn,"Well i had high hopes for this movie dispite its many negative reviews but in the end it ended up being a waste of an hour and a half. If i were a kid i might think some of the jokes funny but as an adult who has seen most of them all before this movie had little to offer and didnt shock or offend me but rather bored me. (spoiler) about the only memorable scene in the movie for me was the frog junky's flashback to nam and even that wasnt very funny but i always enjoy deer hunter parodies and seeing it from a junky frogs perspective was mildly entertaining. The rest of the movie was pea soup vomit gags and lengthy dialogue that lead no where. One star for the attempt at humor and one star for pitty, not the worste way to spend your time but theres not enough weed in Jamaca to make this flick funny."
1,DON'T BUY,"This book has too many obvious errors. Yes, it will help you but why pay for a book that has poor publishing and proofreading. If the publisher/author would like to contact me ... please post a comment here."
1,Don't buy,"This book will not help to pass the exam. The questions are not even similar to the exam's questions. Some things in the book are over explained, that you could think that the reader never have seen VB before, and other more complicated topics are just touched.I would not recommend this book, not only because of waisted money, but because of waisted time."
2,Not worth the money,"Don't publishers proof read these books anymore? Numerous mistakes throughout the book including in the review questions. This book also does not cover things on the exam such as Compatibility settings. It seems as though the author just took the exam topics and wrote something that he thought was important, but not what Microsoft tested. Interestingly, one of the appendices contained test strategies that MS uses on the exams. Unfortunately the questions asked in the review exercises for the most part did not follow these guidelines."
1,"incomplete syllabus, bad questions","This book explains VB 6 in simple language so that even the idiot can understand VB 6 features. However, the content is simple as well and can't help you to pass the exam.Try the exam guide by Howard Hawhee. I'm not sure whether it is the best, but it is second to none so far."
3,Not deep enough,I used this book as my primary study guide. However I needed another book about indepth knowledge on COM/DCOM. The book got you thinking in the right direction and then left you with many questions in the end. That is where the other books come in specifically about COM/DCOM.
3,Decent overview - but too many errors and too shallow,"I just took the 70-175 exam and passed, using this book as my primary study document. However, the exam was much more difficult than any of the practice exams included with the book. Although the book helped me prepare, I relied as much on my 20+ years programming experience as on the book to help pick out the correct responses. Although the book gives a decent overview of many of the topics on the exam, I would not recommend relying on it as a primary source for preparation. There are too many gaping holes and too many errors both in the chapters and in the review questions."
2,A CULT BOOK,"Here is another cult book.It consists of discourses in response to narrow mind-sets of such as middle-class women in Los Angeles between 1920 and 1952, before color TV and things like that.Some parts could be worth chewing on."
2,Couldn't even read the arabic script!,"I was excited about receiving this book, but once it arrived, I opened it up and couldn't even make out the Arabic script because of the (very) poor quality of the print! The English text was even fuzzy. Fortunately the return process went smoothly and I received my money back!"
3,outdated but nice transliteration,Nice transliteration but it is quite outdated (you can't find 'credit card') as it was prepared according to a dictionary which was prepared during WWII.
1,Crosley stackmate adapter is lousy don't buy it,"This adapter is lousy. don't buy it. Certain records, do not drop properly using this adapter, because the adapter is too wide. Records drop halfway down and stick, causing the tone arm to bump against it and land on the turntable, or the record will drop to the turntable, but not turn, because of the width of the adapter, and cause the flip side of the record to be scratched by the turntable. This is not a good product and Crosley should make corrections. I received my first one for a birthday gift and it didn't work properly, so I bought another one thinking the first one was defective. It is defective from the Manufacturer. Crosley, long in the radio business for years, should know better and should make a better adapter. Dont buy this one"
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,"This is NOT a suitable book to prepare for the exam. It contains a lot of syntax whereas the whole exam is scenario based. I studied it through and through and failed. This book is a good revision of the actual study guide, but defenitely not a guaranteed pass for the exam."
1,Don't use as your main study guide or you may fail,"I used this book as my primary study guide for the exam and I barely passed the exam. If I hadn't used the Visual Basic 6 Distributed Exam cram and Transcender as supplements, I probably would have failed. This book does not provide enough depth on vital information for the exam. I would recommend using the transcender and exam cram to pass this exam. Don't waste your time and money on this book."
2,"Cheap, foot looks wider","This shoe looks good enough, but on my feet, they looked a bit stumpy. I tried wearing them with jeans and a skirt, but they weren't very flattering on me. I was also disappointed that the sole is thin, that there was no cushion at all in the footbed, and that the shoe wasn't made of leather (it's actually a man-made, leather-like material). Looks aside, the quality of the materials and the potential longevity issue were the factors that made me return them. I think I might have kept them if they looked like they would have handled wear from walking to work and back.In case anyone is wondering, my wife posted this through my account. I don't wear shoes like this.-CL"
4,The Editorial Review is wrong,"I don't know what the editorial review is referring to, but I assure you it's not this DVD! o.O Enya has absolutely nothing to do with this anime series. ABSOLUTELY nothing.Unfortunately, I can't really review it, since I don't own it and don't know which episodes are contained here, though I have my suspicions. I'm assuming that this is the part of the series where we get into the real meat of it... where we finally meet the real Azaka and Kamidake, and where the threats of ""Yosho"" become imminent."
4,Tenchi Universe Volume 7 Signature Series.,"This is the Tenchi Universe Volume 7 Signature Series (rerelease of popular English dub releases for a cheaper sticker price), so please ignore any references you may have read to Enya on this product page.In volume 7, we get a wide range of episodes. In the first offering the girls, still on the run, compete in a swimsuit competition, and a certain bounty hunter shows up to compete herself. In the second episode, the group finally make it to and through a checkpoint into the Jurai empire, with a little help from someone they hadn't even known was on their side. Finally, the team makes their way to the resting place of the Jurai Guardian Knights, the real Azaka and Kamidake.Volume 7 hits right before most of the best climactic moments before the series finale, so this is really your last chance to catch the best comedic moments in the first TV series of the Tenchi franchise."
4,Techi Universe vol 7 space,this is a great video and not just this video but the whole set of movies. If you like japanes animationn and action cartoons like dragon ball z gundam wing and salior moon your love this.
4,fit ok,the glue holds well but the item is slightly off line with the door but you cannot really tell.i would buy it again
3,Mediocre,"This book was okay - the format of the questions is a bit different from other books, and consequently, the exam. There were many mistakes and discrepancies, and the publisher isn't even recognizing them. (Bad for them.) Questions are rather difficult, but be on your toes for inaccurate information."
2,"Took to long to read, some errors",I found that it took too long to read the qeations and found some errors also. I guess that means know a little to spot errors.
4,A tour through parts of America,Least-Heat covered parts of America I have not visited. It was almost like being there. Going to remember some and put on my bucket list.
3,A travel journal + personal issues,"An interesting look at 1980's America. I wasn't particularly interested in the personal angst that drove the journey, but the descriptions of the people and places were worth reading."
4,A great journey.,I love these type of books that explore little known areas of America and the people that live there. And this is one of the best that I have read.
2,"Some engrosing conversations, but few and far between","Although William Least Heat-Moon's book does contain a few interesting pictures of American life, and his run-ins with such characters as farmers, diner-owners and a shipbuilder are sort of folksy and wonderful, they are so buried in the minor, uninteresting details of the trip as to make the reader wish that Least Heat-Moon had written a magazine article instead of a 412-page tome."
1,It was very boring!,I had trouble staying awake for this one. I was like watching paint dry. I get giddy just thinking about it. I seen a better written book on teletubbies. Do not buy this book!
1,Don't waste your time,"Though I cannot, at the moment, cite a better alternative because I haven't yet read any, I am sure they do exist. At least let's hope so..."
1,This is ABSOLUTELY the WORST book I have EVER read!!!,"I was forced to read this book as part of my english gifted and talented class. It was the slowest, longest, worst written book ever! The best part of the book was the end. It ended! Finally, a long book about nothing. I will NEVER read this book again and I DON'T encourage anyone else to read this. PLEASE save yourselves the boredom and stupidity that comes from this book. This guy has nothing better to do than go around in little boondocks in the US and force people to have conversations with him. It's irritating. It's boring. Please do yourselves some good and read cool books like Les Miserables, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, A tale of Two Cities, and other classics."
3,The road most of us never see,"If you love to travel, then this is a good read for you. Heat-Moon gets us off the busy roads of life into the real America and allows us to see the great diversity of people who make up our wonderful country. His encounters with people make this a delightful story as he travels around the U.S. and takes time to sit down and let the folks talk. His re-telling of these stories is the strong point of the book. When he gets involved in history or background of areas, I found it a bit dull. I think this book really gives credibility to the old saying of St.Augustine: ""The whole world is a book. Those who do not travel read only one page."""
4,A gently adventurous tale.,"This book was written by the author after he had experienced personal and professional losses. His position as an English teacher was eliminated. He decided to travel across the country staying on the ""blue"" highways and avoiding the super highways. This resulted in a fascinating narrative of his experiences in small towns reflecting the culture, introducing us to people and their stories. He discovers prejudices still active in parts of the south, rural towns that are struggling to survive. Most interesting to me were his conversations with local people and bartenders and waiters and cowboys. His description of the experiences of various Native American tribes and the impact on their lives reflects his knowledge and experience. His own adventures and sometimes near catastrophes add humor and suspense. Very good book. A classic!"
4,Makes me want to buy a truck and hit the road,"This author speaks to the yearning in many of us to ""hit the road"" and not only see what our amazing country is all about, but also to see what we're all about. It's typical in some ways: snapshots of various odd and lovely and not-so-lovely places along America's disappearing back roads. We not only see these places vividly, but also meet the lively and unusual people the author encounters. I don't know if such a journey is possible these days. It seems like we're running out of blue highways and that franchise eateries and stores are taking over even the out-of-the-way places. The book makes me want to hurry up, to buy that truck and put a mattress in the back -- before it's too late. Well-written, entertaining, thought-provoking: this is a timeless book about a timeless journey."
2,Blue Highways: Journey into My Depressed American Self,"Least Heat Moon's descriptions of America's people and places are densely atmospheric and wonderfully true to life. Without a doubt, they're the best part of the book. If only they were the only part of the book... His nostalgic (melancholy?) brooding and dreary introspection are not what I expected from this ""Journey into America."" I am not against bias; I did not take the trip-- but it would have been a lot more enjoyable without the clutter and weight of the author's personal baggage. I enjoyed reading about the folks and forgotten spots he visited along the way, but suggest that the title and publisher copy be changed to reflect his depressed inner journey if it's all part of the long, boring trip."
3,Too Liberal,"I've travelled many parts of this country with and without money. I enjoyed many parts of this book and I recommend it to fellow adventurers.However, I kept getting the feeling that Mr. Heat-Moon was condescending.His snide remarks about religion and faith made me wonder what he was doing freeloading off of a monastery.It seems pointless to me to try to understand people without understanding their personal beliefs and how central they are to these ""colorful""characters. He doesn't seem to GET what several of the people are saying, and does cringe-worthy things like telling people in an old southern white saloon in Selma Alabama, he's here to ""See how the Blacks are doing.""All in all though, everybody should do something like discovering your own backyard, and keep off the beaten track."
3,Tour book,Took a tour of America with a chip on his shoulder. Guess it gives you a different perspective.
2,Tedious,Not at all as interesting as I hoped it would be. The back roads of USA should be able to offer a much more colourful and interesting web than this.
3,TOO WORDY,I GOT HALF WAY THROUGH THE BOOK AND IT NO LONGER HELD MY INTEREST. WHAT I WANTED TO GET FROM THIS BOOK WAS MORE LOCAL DISCRIPTION OF THE PLACES VISITED AND NOT THE GOINGS ON ABOUT WHAT THE AUTHOR WAS THINKING THE WHOLE TIME. I WANTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE 'BLUE HIGHWAYS' AND THE TOWNS BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE THE TRIPS MYSELF. IT LEFT ME FEELING THAT THE SOUTH WAS AND STILL IS AN AWFUL PLACE TO LIVE.
3,"A good, solid book","Maybe I am too stingy, as it seems I give fewer stars than people who liked the book less.It is a nice, solid journey through America. Better than Travels with Charley, but not up to Calvin Trillin (to name two authors whom this author seems to feel he is in competition with).I was a bit put off the book by the reviewers who wrote about ""two books"" -- his inner journey vs. the actual one; these reviewers pretty much did not enjoy his sufferings, and I was nervous about a self-absorbed whine-fest. Actually, it is nowhere near as dramatic as the reviews suggest. The book is a fine balance of the author's internal struggles and his travels; never did I get the feeling that one was out of place or too dominant.The book is not stunning, and has less insight than it promises. However, it is intelligent, interesting, and an enjoyable read."
5,A classic!,One of the classic travel boos of all time. Up there with Steinbeck's 'Travels with Charlie'. I've read it ten times over the past twenty years.
4,enjoyable read,This book is a joy in discovering the people and places along the backroads of America. Makes you want to get in the car and just drive.
1,Not a well written book,Book is one of the most boring I have ever tried to read. I read many travel books but this one is awful.
4,Road Trip classic,"Heat Moon was one of the first to do it... and his journal-like style gives a real sense of authenticity to his work. It's the details that make this book - the strange, average yet unique people he meets, the descriptions of the little roads, the tiny towns, the underwhelming meals. That's what life is, after all..."
5,Riveting,One of the most interesting and compelling pieces of non-fiction that I personally have ever read. I would fully recommend this to anybody with an interest in human nature.
2,Ba'al: The Storm God,"Caught this on the SciFi channel on a rainy Sunday. How appropriate as any other time I wouldn't have given it a viewing. If it wasn't for an almost fair script and acting I would have totally flipped the channel. The story revolves around a wacked out archeologist wanting to bring Ba'al back to life. Two people unite to stop his fiendish plot to become a god himself. I've certainly scene better (pun intended) but after watchingMega Shark vs Giant Octopus / 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea, I'm willing to give more latitude to other SciFi movies. Afterall the intelligent dialogue and directing (Ziller) here was certainly better. Even with this, watching a giant storm and boring people arguing about how to stop it just didn't keep me on the edge of my seat. If you enjoyed this, seek another opinion.CA Luster"
2,Pseudo pleasant movie...,Ansolutely nothing memorable in this movie --- if I hadn't bought it through Amazon marketplace for just a few dollars I would have been very upset with myself --- don't buy this because it's a waste...
2,not very good even for a grade b movie,"the plot is silly the acting horrid and the cgi boring and recycled in the movie. at such a high amazon price tag i thought it would be a sleeper,,, oh boy it was it put me to sleep.i was especially annoyed by the military uniforms that were randomly put together with absolutely no thought to realism, a leautenant wearing captains bars AND upside down corperals chevrons on his sleeve and that was a small example of the many problems. wasnt there anyone connected with this movie that was at least in the military? apparently not.ignore the good reviews save your money and buy something else maybe 'swamp thing'"
1,What a piece of garbage,If you going to make a movie using computer effects. Do NOT make the effects look like computer effects. Real computer effects look real. Very bad effects. The storyline was ok the acting was ok but for me the bad effects over shaddowed and thing else that was good.
5,Good Enough to Share,"This is a good book on a very sensitive issue, especially for young girls. While this book looks at abortion as an option, it offers many alternatives and discusses the pros and cons of all of them - there are no rose colored glasses, no matter what choice is made. I appreciated the authenticity of the author and her respectful treatment of each choice discussed."
5,So good it hurts,"I've read this book twice. Once alone and now aloud to my 4 children. It is such a gift to find books that burrow down deep inside and make themselves part of you. Make you a better you!Little Britches is such a book. Ralph Moody had an uncanny way of using the sparsest of prose to convey the grandest of meaning. Every emotion is felt in this book and you just become a part of the Moody family and experience. The relationship between Father and Little Britches is humbling to read, honestly. And the way Ralph Moody could write about it 40 years later with such clarity and distinction is a real tribute to the men that they both were. I cried both times. More this time actually. You'll never forget the words ""And I became a man""THANK YOU Ralph Moody.I also recommend ""THE DAY NO PIGS WOULD DIE"""
5,A Western True Story that is enjoyed across generations,"This book was recommended by a co-worker that read it as a chld(she's now in her 50s) I purchased it for my 11 year old son. I gotinto reading it during a family vacation in Yellowstone and found myself unable to put it down as I read chapters to my sons. It is a gripping story of making the best of what you have, while doing the right and honest thing. It's as readable as it was decades ago. Read it yourself and share the story and values with your children or grandchildren."
5,I read the book years ago untill the pages fell out,I was truely inspired by this book I cant w wait for my son to read it
5,Encouragement for difficult days!,"One of the best books I have ever read! Ralph Moody combines a life with amazing adventures with an equally amazing ability as a story-teller. He brings the people and events to life and includes humor, drama, tragedy, and the determination and persistence the pioneers used to overcome incredibly difficult obstacles. You won't regret purchasing and reading this book--it will be read, reread, and passed on to others!"
5,This is a wonderful book!,"Little Britches is a wonderful book. The descriptions are easy to picture and the story is very calming. I am 14 and enjoyed reading it, and then I started reading to the kids I baby sit. The feelings/emotions cross all age boundaries. I highly suggest the whole series."
4,Content warning,"Although this is truly a wonderful book in many respects, parents should realize that the hero is quite frequently SPANKED for his mischief making by his father. Also, I find it to be a little too much for my 5 year old, it is really more appropriate for the average 8 year old. The boy in the story is 8 as well."
5,A must for every family!,"Ralph Moody's book Little Britches is a really good book for people of all ages. As you read the words he wrote you feel like you are actually on the ranch in 1906 w/Ralph. The punishments, jobs, weather and animals Ralph encounter are priceless as he learns a lesson from each. I recomend this biography for anyone who likes a good book about the old times!"
5,Similar to Little House Series,Our family enjoyed listening to this as a read aloud. The older children followed much better than the younger ones.Very good story.
3,Review from Branddenotes.blogspot.com,"Interesting book on the political economy of the cultural revolution. Mao believed that revolution should be permanent, or at least continually reoccurring, to prevent the emergence and consolidation of an elite class - something that is clearly possible even in nominally Communist countries. Now that China has the capacity to provide all sorts of articles of wealth to its people, it would be a good time for another drive to level hierarchies, forcing managers to share manual labor and workers to learn and carry out management responsibilities."
4,"Remaster, please",Sco and band tear it up as only they can; every track is a gem. Unfortunately the sound is thin; I can't imagine this band played so quietly! Gramavision needs to get it together and remaster this puppy.
4,RIding lawn mower blades,these are just as good as if not even better than purchasing at SearsIt would have been almost $40. at sears and I paid $25 Can t beat that
4,A good Buy,"These mower blades are of good quality, and so much cheaper than OEM Blades I would reccommend these blades to anyone ordering lawnmower blades if you want a quality product at a reasonable price."
5,very good quality,"We have made several purchases of Emerilware and have been very happy with them. We give them to our daughter who uses them on a daily basis, and she is a tough judge!"
4,Great for word lovers who prefer large type!,"This book contains over 35,000 uncomplicated definitions, as well as: charts of weights and measures, the metric system (including conversions) and U.S. states and capitals. It is an easy-to-use reference allowing for quick access to information.It is an important resource in our adult learning center."
3,"Simple, lightweight dictionary","I purchased this dictionary for a man in his late 40's who was learning to read for the first time. He liked it because it was simple, gave clear, brief definitions, and was lightweight, thus easy to carry about with his other books. It would not have been very useful to me or, in my opinion, to any other fully educated person because of its simplicity; however, it seemed to meet his needs at that time."
4,Perfect Memory,"Easy techniques that appear to be somewhat child-minded, nonetheless, they remain effective. I was very pleased with the quick results. I would've liked more information about mind-mapping. However, the absence of any detailed information on mind-mapping is available in some of Buzan's other books. Overall, easy and effective techniques and I am pleased with the purchase."
1,Absolute trash ...,I bought the first edition of this book - which was about 700 pages;It cost me $44.95 - and the book was not worth a penny! I believe the 2nd edition is better - because it has some extra pages and these last few pages are supposed to be better! I find that hard to believe ... The authors do not know how to write a technical book - they are belligerent! The book wanders all over the place - no details at all - or none of any consequence! If the publishers had any conscience they would send me the last section of the new edition FOR FREE! This was one of the worst computer books that I have ever run across ... AVOID other books by these authors!
2,"too much hype from ""sponsors""","There is useful information in this book. But most of the book consists of ""case studies"", some of which are interesting and some of which are not, but all of which essentially hype a ""sponsor"" middleware. This book is an ""infomercial"" that you have to pay for. A ripoff."
1,This from the masters of XML !!??,hard to read. Doesn't explain the material well. And you are NOT going to be an expert on XML after reading this.
3,handbook not technical reference,"I too bought this book thinking that it would bring me into the world of XML. I had no previous recommendation and I thought hey! it's by the creator. After reading 70 odd pages on the background and the application of XML I was chomping at the bit for some syntax diagrams but no, you gotta wait for chapter 31 (page 423). Hmmm. If you want to learn XML and XML only buy another book. If you want a complete run-down on XML use in the industry plus the XML spec then go ahead and buy this."
1,Heavy Paperweight,"This book starts strong, then becomes a sad use of dead trees. There are a number of good examples on the uses of XML, but many overlap and become repetitive. The previous comment on poor editing is well founded...the number of blantant printing and typographical errors is astounding."
1,"First Commercials During Movie Previews, and Now This","A good percentage of this book is dedicated to case studies, which are pure marketing drivel from the ""sponsors"" of the book. (Who ever heard of book sponsors, anyway?)As if that weren't bad enough, in the preface we find: ""Some applications and case studies were done with full SGML before XML had a formal existence, but are within XML's capabilities. These are described as having been done with XML.""Excuse me?"
2,Not a bad marketing gimmick. It mentions XML too.,"The first 4 chapters talk about XML, as do the last 10 chapters. Sadly, Chapters 5 through 30 are case studies 'sponsored' by such companies as Microsoft and Adobe. Some are dedicated to showing you how cool their XML development products are(so you will buy them) while others are dedicated to showing you the sponsor's view of how XML should evolve(meaning in what direction Microsoft is planning to steer the XML movement.)In all fairness, some of the material in this book is good, and if you want to understand what XML is and how companies are using it, perhaps this book is for you.If, however, you are like me, and are looking for a book that will assist you in the implementation of XML, take the advice of the other reviewers who advise you to look somewhere else. I spent $40.00 on this book, and I can guarantee that it will sit in my group's technical library collecting dust. Maybe someone will write a good XML book someday..."
3,"Average Book, Above Average XML Book","Publishers are spewing out XML books, and most of them are unfocused and hastily written. This book, by two of the biggest names in SGML, rises above other XML books and contains some important ideas for finally realizing on the promise of SGML/XML. Unfortunately, many of the book's 61 chapters are ""sponsored"" by vendors trying to peddle XML products by contributing the text from their marketing brochures for use in the book. The result is a somewhat disorganized and overly commercial presentation of XML. Nevertheless, the book is worth purchasing over others on XML."
2,"Good suumary, but not for programmers","This is a good summary of where XML and associated technologies come from, and where they are going. It has good links to get the latest on standards. The CD-ROM has a lot of software packages. HOWEVER, this is defintely not for programmers. Do not look for code examples or anything close."
2,Includes 350 pages of advertiser essays,"I kept reading more of the book to see if it would get better. Unfortunately, it did not.Good points:--Part 1 offers a concise introduction to XML.--Part 5 offers a good, although wordy, treatment of XML definitions and usage.Bad Points:--Three sections (almost 350 pages) of superficial ""case studies"" (ads) sandwiched between Parts 1 and 5.-- Only in Chapter 33 is the Spec Reference Structure explained -- after over 400 pages of examples using this format-- Poor organization inhibits utility. The book is simply not structured in a logical manner which makes it difficult to understand a logical system like XML."
1,Lacks continuity...,I purchased this book with great expectations and the book failed them all. I was not able to get a complete picture of the core topic - XML because there is lack of continuity here. Even the business applications have not been explained proprely - the power of XML is never demonstrated effectively.
1,Where are the examples?????,"For the money I shelled out for this book, I expected to be able to see some fairly decent examples of how to 1. Write the XML code and 2. Use what I've written. Admittedly, I did skim through the book, but I figured, ""Hey, it's the guy who wrote the SGML spec - can't be too bad, must've just missed something. I'll catch it when I read the book.""Well, I haven't found it yet... still looking...nope, not there.I am very disappointed...And what the heck is a ""chapter sponsor"" or a book sponsor, anyway? If you've got sponsors, I should be able to get the book a wholoe lot cheaper.What a waste of money."
5,excellent overview of XML,"""~buy this book to get an excellent overview of XML and its potential applicability to your web needs. very clear and easy read. worth taking the time to read and understand who, what, when, where, and why XML. the brush strokes are broad and provide reader with sound high level foundation and perspective.""~ the perspective; but, you need the know how and are chomping at the bit to get into the doing part of actually solving your problem and getting to your solution, then this is not the book for you."
2,Too much fluff,"As a software developer and product designer, I was looking for a book on XML that could quickly give me an understanding of how XML works to allow me to ponder how I may apply it. I'm still looking. After a reasonably promising start (though a little too cute and rah-rah), there is a series of chapters that read like bad magazine articles geared toward managers. After a bit of puzzlement, I realized I needed to skip 400 pages ahead to get back to the explanation of how XML works! And in that section there are too many forward references to make reading comfortable. I have just ordered a second XML book. Wish me luck!"
3,Much advertisment and too few real XML explanation.,The order of the chapters in this book is IMHO wrong - I think the XML-specification should be at the beginning and all of these sponsored chapters (30 (!)) full of advertisment for several products and companies should follow it. As the book is structured now you first read 10 chapters and question yourself where are the technical things (as promised on the cover)? Personally i skipped the following 20 chapters and read the last 10 chapters - these are really good.
3,75% of this book is pure trash,"The reviewer who states that this book is offensive because it consists of almost 50 chapters of random advertisements, written by different ""sponsors"".... is absolutely right.This book is offensive. But if you get past the first 50 chapters, and read the last 15 or so chapters, you might agree with me that they are well written. These chapters teach you the technical specifics of XML, DTD's, XSL, XPath, XPointer, XLink, and Schemas. A pretty fine introduction if you ask me. 5 stars for pages 720 thru 950. 0 stars for the rest of the book, and shame on the authors for subjecting their paying customers to such a glut of material.I'm tempted to take a set of tree-trimmers and chop off the first 720 pages. It would be easier to carry around with me that way too.... Hmmm....."
2,More Marketing Materials,"This book includes a lot of topics but mainly at the level of marketing documents, it may be good for some high-level managers but not very useful for developers."
4,"Case studies, methodology, and real-world experience","Sure, you won't learn how to code XML. What you will get are real-world solutions to real-world problems. If you're trying to make the case for XML in your organization, buy this book. Tutorial chapters give strong introduction to the tech specifics. The CD is packed with tools to start experimenting with. Recommended for project managers, information architects, and anyone in content management."
2,XML Handbook Prostitutes Itself,"The XML handbook starts out as an interesting and extremely well written book. It gives excellent background and presents the history and philosophy of XML in a fine and interesting manner - almost as good as a novel! Suddenly, it drops you and goes from page 110 - 720 describing products for you to buy that you have not even been presented a background for yet. The at page 720 the book starts again. This 990 page book ends up with 380 pages of book and 610 pages of commercials! This is preposterous! It's also a shame that what could and should have been a fine book sold itself cheaply - and expects the customer to pay the price. I'm sad for the authors."
1,Not really an introduction or a handbook.,"There are far better books, that cost less, are more concise andreveal a lot more about XML and the impact it is starting to have onsociety. If you are a programmer seeking a technical guide, this isnot for you either."
5,Excellent book! Well written and full of great information.,"This book is an excellent choice for learning about XML and the technologies (both new and old) that are utilizing or planning on utilizing XML. This book has something for everyone in the XML world, both novices and experts."
4,Good book for understanding XML; not for learning to program,"I concur with the gentleman who says that if you want to learn to program XML - this is not the book you want. As a manager making product programming decisions, I needed a book to: (1) help me understand what XML is against the context of all the other internet enabling languages, (2) how it relates to EDI data exchange, and (3) where it is applicable. This book hit each one of these areas on the head for me. It's already been borrowed by two other managers who work with me who are trying to get up to speed also.No matter what anyone else says, this book was 100% on target for what I was looking for and I now have a clearer understanding and can talk the topic. My thanks to the author."
4,Reivew,"Ordered the book with it marked acceptable used, when received there was an issue - but after they worked with me to combat the issue, very customer service orientated!"
3,The book is great... the construction is not.,I am now 30 years old and remember having this book as a child. I LOVED it so I wanted to add it to my book collection for my daughter. Unfortunately I found multiple movable parts broken due to being stuck together and then breaking in the un-sticking process. One page (the bedroom scene) was not threaded right and tore when I pulled the tab. The book was rather cheap when I bought it and it shows in the construction. I will probably buy it again and be very careful inspecting and unsticking the movable parts.
5,haunted house,I was surprised at how quickly the book I ordered was sent to my house. Thank you for your quick response. Terri
5,Haunted House,"This wonderful pop-up book is now my grandchildren's favorite! The pop-up engineering is amazing. The children can open cabinet doors and closet doors(complete with 3-dimensional ghosts),make the friendly monsters move, and the octopus wash the dishes. It is a very interactive, entertaining book."
5,Love this book...had it as a kid,This book has a lot of quality put into the pop ups. Lots of things to look and and discover. Had this book as a kid and now sending it on to my niece.
3,"OK, but many subtle errors in it","I happen to like books with lots of questions to test my readiness for a certain exam. For the most part, this book accomplishes that (hence 3 stars). It does, however, have many subtle errors so you need to check each answer you get wrong with an authoritative resource, like SQL Server Books Online. For example, is says to upgrade SQL 6.5 to SQL 7.0 the SQL 6.5 system needs SP4 - which is incorrect, it needs SP3. Lots of little mistakes like that. By all means, use this book as a resource, but NEVER as your ONLY one. You'd also be wise to double check every wrong answer you get (which of course consumes that much more of your valuable time)."
1,Not even close,"Don't waste your time or money on this one. I went through the MS MOC classes, read Inside SQL (a must have for anyone studing for the MCDBA cert.) and then bought this book. I also read the Troy Techs. This book was way off of both tests, 70-28 and 70-29. To get it done, study the MOC materials, read Inside SQL, and work with the product as much as possible. But don't buy this book."
2,Sorry - No cigar,"This book seriously lacks the depth and difficulty that would be required to have a taste of the real Design exam. I have not used this book to pass the Admin exam, so I cannot comment on that. The only reason to buy this title is to give yourself a start. It is not by any means representative of the actual exam. May I suggest that you study from ""Inside SQL Server 7.0"" from Microsoft Press and from ""Professional SQL Server 7.0 Programming"" from Wrox. Both of these are wonderful books. All in all, if you have the cash to stash, you can buy this title as well, But I would advise against using it to measure your preraredness to the exam.Good Luck Gabor Bona (B.Sc. MCSE MCDBA MCP+I)"
2,Helping you to fail your exam,Book is not detail enough to guide both beginner or experience professional to pass the exam. ALL books from Syngress Media for MCSD OR MCSE are bad for the exam... do not get it!!!!
2,Only 1MB of storage?,"Most services provide far more than 1MB of storage. I tried to upgrade, but was stuck on hold with a medium-quality customer support specialist. After finally explaining my situation, he said that what I was requesting was beyond the scope of our SLA.Expect lukewarm to tepid service."
2,not satisfied,"As the blade enters the siding, it begins to vibrate and removes chunks of the siding. Therefore, the cut is not very clean."
5,"Energy, Creativity, and Sabotage","If you love graffiti, you've got to see this film. If you love playing with the system, you've got to see this film. If you just love...Inside or outside your head. Inside the gallery or on the street. Inside the movement or dominant culture or outside the movement or...An hour's worth of priceless art and interviews with ZEVS, Swoon, Os Gemeos, Adams and Itso, Ron English, Pigmeus, Earsnot and more, not to mention the other hour of extras devoted to an extended interview with Os Gemeos, the Nofitti gang of Berlin, Steve Mona of NYPD and others, and slideshows of Swoon's and ZEVS' work.Energy, creativity, and sabotage cannot be damped in this well-made documentary by Andreas Johnsen. Neither can a continuing dialogue about what makes community, who owns what, and what is art. But ""art"" is foremost on everyone's mind: how you do it, where you do it, what its purpose is. A thoroughly thought provoking study of the evolving art of graffiti. Inspired and inspiring!"
3,"Best I have seen, but still not enough","For what is out there, so far this seems to be the best I have found. But being a diabetic, on too many medicines, there still is just not enough room for a week's supply. All the pockets are fine, just don't fill them and expect to close it."
1,Another poor choice,"I confess - I have not yet used this item. However, based on the use of the companion item, I cannot think that this item keeps meds cool any longer than 5-6 hours - and that is using BOTH cool packs. Again, there is NO insulation to keep the cold actually cold."
5,Item as described. Thanks!,"I didn't know before purchasing, that this has French writing as well as English writing on it. Seem to have all or almost all of the same special features as the regular individual movie sets. Still is a great box set, who ever is in charge should continue making box sets for these movies. I know WB came out with the first 3 movies in an okay box set, then Miramax with these movies (4-7), I saw a crappy version that you can buy from places such as Wal-Mart and Target for about $5, doesn't compare to how awesome this box set is. Viz now should release at least 4 movie box sets or 3 movie box sets for the rest of the series since they own the rights now.Now if only they would release Johto Journeys, Johto League Champions, Advanced Challenge, and Advanced Battle on dvd box sets!So if you are a fan of the series, I recommend getting this box set."
5,iBeam Fo' Life,iBeam is a good product.. the laser goes a quarter of a mile. hasnt malfunctioned yet. flashlight is high quality. nothing bad to say about it. great price!!
1,Not for the new IPOD,"I got this as a Christmas present, and the person buying it knew what IPOD I had (IPOD Video), but there is nothing on this page or on the packaging to indicate what versions of the IPOD it works with. So disappointed! Amazon needs to modify the item description to indicated which versions of the IPOD this works with and which it doesn't."
1,Doesn't work with itouch,"no wonder it was only [...] bucks, now that I look closer I see the ipod touch isn't supported, but wtf, it says it ""works will all 'docking ipods'""I have an ipod touch, it docks, but apparently that's not a ""docking ipod.""Total waste of money! =/"
1,Works only with old ipods,"This was touted as good with ""all dockable ipods""but does not work with Ipod video, etc. I gave it away to someone with an older ipod. There needs to be a slot next to the earphone jack for this to work. Ad is deceptive!"
1,Will not work on he 5G iPods,Disappointing as it is not something that works on the new iPods and Griffin has discontinued it
2,"Looks cool at first, but...","Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty clever gadget. However, it's mising one thing in terms of usability: an on/off switch. This really limits the usability of both, since it's typical to want to turn the flashlight off for a moment, or the laser pointer on for a moment. I can't see me using this laser pointer in a real presentation, since it'd either be on all the time, or I'd be pulling the light in and out all the time (neither of which make me look cool).So if you're going to buy this, keep this limitation in mind."
5,Double guitar fantastic,"If you ever saw The Faces or Bo Diddley live. If you appreciate thier innovative own unique guitar playing and styles...Then this is it Baby. Ya, I know Ronnie has got this gig with The Stones these days. Anyway, these two together Live. One of the Best Live guitar jamming, rockin sessions ever. GET THIS ONE. I consider mine to be one of the best CD's ( signature edition ) in my over 500 collection. Ya, Baby, thats right!"
4,only the beginning,"This book was my introduction to Frank. I mean, I knew who he was and had heard one or two of his songs, but that's it. Reading this book gave me a good overview of the guy. It covers everything from his upbringing to music to parenting and everything else. I especially enjoyed reading his ideas on composition. After finishing this book, I feel like I have a better idea of where to start album-wise and which of the other Zappa books I want to read next."
4,Subjectivity at it's finest,"I find Zappa a fascinating character. Here you have an individual who wanted to be very individual and extreemly inquisitive in his younger years, then generally went against most norms. I found too many areas of the book to be interesting, but I found the chapter on his working relationship with various orchestras very enlightening. Here you have in raw form the work and the frustrations involved in getting a piece of music written then attempted to be performed and recorded. His frustrations eventually led to him having his own record label and managing his own creative outlet. Although I would have liked to give this five stars, I just couldn't agree with everything he said. Zappa is fascinating. It also makes me feel at ease that there were those who went against the norms."
5,The Real FZ Book,"I have read the Real Frank Zappa Book twice now, and I have to say that it is one of the best books I have ever read. There were some spots that I felt dragged on, but they were few and far in between. I have only been really into FZ for about four years now, so I am fairly new to his work. This book was informative, thought provoking, and often humorous. It is a MUST READ for any Frank Zappa fan!"
4,Good book but what about you frank?,"Frank made me laugh while reading this book. Especially the parts where he was messing with explosives as a kid... I won't ruin it for you... but you never really get past the outline of the edge of fz's personality. DOesn't talk about how he feels about life itself. Just music. could be that frank was an olympic size pool, with a deep end and a shallow end... I am not sure. I was really trying to see inside FZ on this book, but it just made me laugh. I get the feeling that frank was 'performing' for this outing as well."
4,Skimpy on details but still a good book,"I wish this book went more into why studios took a risk on him, how he persuaded his band to switch from being a typical bar band into the strangest group of the 60s, and more of the history of his groups, but I can't complain too much. This is a fascinating, funny, and incredibly smart book from one of the most talented musicians of all time."
4,"Great guy, but he can't write","This is a terrific book. Zappa is nothing if not an individual, and the story of what he went through to stay that way in the music business is inspiring, in an extremely weird sort of way. His devotion to his family (particularly his wife) and his determination to stay true to his beliefs is rare in a rock musician, I think, and a lesson for everyone. The best part is his description of his fight against the Parents Musical Resource Council, and particularly his testimony. People like Zappa are why the First Amendment was invented, and why it still matters. Warning: he is not a writer. He's a musician, and so his writing relies a lot on exclamation points, italics and bold type. This gets old after a while. This is a minor objection, though -- he's truly an inspiration, and this book is well worth buying and reading."
5,"A great musician, an interesting guy, and a good read for any Zappa fan","The man behind the music. His own words, as told to his interviewer. There is a method to his madness. I am too young to have seen Frank live, although I've seen his son Dweezil many times on the Zappa Plays Zappa tours -- it is interesting to read his thoughts on many topics -- sometimes serious, sometimes tongue-in-cheek, always entertaining."
2,Boring,"Very little historical information; instead, mostly dated rants, opinions, and ah, yes, information about what Frank ate for dinner, if that strikes your fancy.It was somewhat interesting, however, to read Frank's reasoning concerning the whole PMRC/Tipper Gore/censorship thing, that it was being used to draw attention from other legislation that was much more evil."
2,Frank Zappa was a blowhard,"The only difference between the ""wisdom"" and ""humor"" that Frank Zappa and ""Red"" Auerbach put out is that Auerbach knows that his routine IS a routine. Frank Zappa just knew what he knew. Whoopee!"
2,Coming out story made by straight people,"At first I was gonna give it 3 stars. But after I had read some other reviews (I didn't have a chance to watch additional comments on dvd), I stopped at 2.WHy?Here's why:- Coming out story is the base of the plot, innit? Instead of making the relation between Riley and Andy more real, we are treated with scenes full of naked boobs, naked women)...- There is no chemistry between those two gays. P. Jones remains straight during the whole film.- The coming out moment is so fake. Slides? Who came with such lame idea in plot?- Instead of fighting with stereotypes, this film confirms 'em.- Some of the scenes are way too long or out of place- The type of jokes used in the plot is quite simple (farts? playing with dirty language? maybe good for teen comedy, but not for ""mature"" film)Good coming out story? ""BREAKFAST WITH SCOTT"", ""BALLS"".""Outing Riley"" it just a poor story made by straight guys who thought they were funny...Shame."
3,"Definitely indie, but still a sweet movie","I caught this movie recently on Logo. Very sweet, albeit very indie. Good acting overall, some scenes are a little unnecessary and go a bit long, but you do get the feeling that these four men are definitely brothers, with similar childhoods but very different adult lives. I admit I caught this movie specifically because I am a Nathan Fillion fan, and he's great in it."
5,Nice,It was a good GLBT oriented movie. I've enjoyed it however I wish it had been written and made in a more fast-paced way. Still it was entertaining.
3,outing riley,Not a bad movie to watch and has its cutesy scenes. This story has a fairly good and easy plot to follow with a surprise ending.
4,Better than I thought it would be!,"As the title eludes to, this is a coming out story. It's more on the serious side, with some lighthearted humor here and there. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was good an entertaining. Bobby Riley is a masculine gay man, who likes sports, beer & gets along great with his brothers. Little do they realize he's gay."
4,Great Quality!!!,I love Columbia shoes. This is a very ruged shoe. Could be used for any level of hiking venture.
2,Worth the price and not a penny more,"I paid a ridiculously small amount for this pair of shoes - under $20. With how little I paid for them, they are fine. I would not recommend then at full price. They are not worth $69. There is no discernible arch support, the soles are not padded, and the sides are not supportive."
3,Durable but heavy,I purchased these trail shoes to hike part of the Grand Canyon. While breaking them in I noticed they are quite heavy. It took a while to get use to and I ended up wearing them on long hikes. They are very durable. Worth the price especially for short hikes.
2,Points for Effort,"Although the best of Paul and Hollace Davis' first trilogy, Zorba the Hutt's Revenge provides even more of the same as the style is made to entertain people, but not be a significant part of the history of Star Wars."
4,In Search of Origins,The work of Triseliotis is significant because it contributed to a change in attitudes about adoption search.
4,Start of a great career,Susan Hayward gives a bravura performance in her first starring role. It was clear from this film that she would someday be an Academy Award-winning best actress.
5,Movies are made forEVER!,This old great was a favorite mothers. Was so great to find it on Amazon and surprise her with old memories. Susan Hayworth.....they don't make many like her anymore!
4,Smash Up,"A good movie, Susan Hayward is always good in all she has done, but this film is medium and fairly predictable."
3,B Movie---,"Not a wonderful movie, but my lady wanted Susan Hayward movies, ordered others, they were not bad. If you like SH, you may like this.At least there is dialogue not filled withexpletives rather than intelligible language."
3,Smash Up or Smashed,"I love Susan Hayward, her acting is brilliant, this film is a little dated, too much singing when crooning the baby to sleep, not short and sweet they overdid it with some of her husbands singing, otherwise not a bad film, watchable but a little dated. Eddie Albert plays almost the same role in this as he did when she was in The story of Lillan Roth. This aside I still love Susan Hayward Movies"
4,sensational Susan in her first big role,"You can definitely see the beginnings of Susan Hayward's performance (as drunken singing star Lillian Roth in 1955's ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"") in this, her very first Academy Award-nominated performance, 1947's SMASH-UP.Susan Hayward stars as Angie Evans, a singer who gives away her career for marriage and motherhood. But when her husband Ken's (Lee Bowman) radio career suddenly shifts into high-gear, Angie--unable to cope in the harsh world spotlight--begins taking comfort in the bottom of champagne bottles.Co-starring Marsha Hunt and Eddie Albert, SMASH-UP does offer a blueprint for the eventual performance which Hayward gave in ""I'll Cry Tomorrow""; indeed the fictional Angie shares many similaries with real-life Lillian Roth. If there is a weak link in the cast it's Lee Bowman; he simply can't match the energy that Hayward generates in their scenes. Sometimes it's like Hayward is trying to revive a cold, dead fish.Recommended for Hayward fans."
3,"Dated, But Not Boring","Hayward was the anti-Crawford. Here she plays Angela, a neurotic and frazzled souse who flings herself onto the furniture in bouts of self-pity and whining. She is really hard to root for. You expect her to pick herself up by the bootstraps, but this is not a Cinderella story. It is a dated psychodrama about the hapless yearnings of the weaker sex. For that reason it's interesting to watch today. They couldn't have made Angela's worries more trivial, less substantial if they tried, but they're enough to send the damsel into a spiral of depression. Thank goodness most mid-century American women were not so fragile."
3,Funk to grow on,"This cd has great lyrics and great beats. Plant Life rhymes are very smart. If they keep working hard like this,the group will live up to the hype."
4,Well made and reliable,"We have been using one of these for about a year with 4 x 500GB Western Digital SATA drives. We buy the slightly more expensive WD drives that are made for RAID setups. Anyway, in RAID 5, we get 1.5TB of reliable network storage shared by several Windows XP machines and one OSX Mac.It is a little tricky setting up each client machine but once you get it done things work well.Two areas for improvement:-Although we use SATA II drives in this NAS, it only supports SATA I speed, so we are losing a little. This isn't a big deal since this is being used for backup/archiving only;-Drives attached to the USB ports cannot be formatted NTFS.We have suggested these improvements to Intel. Hope their next version has it.Anyway, the unit has been reliable and is very reasonably priced."
2,Not worth it regardless of price,"I had to buy two of these, the first one failed with all of my data on it, I bought the the other to recover the information. It worked yes but that unit failed after two months. I had luckily learned my lesson and backed up everything onto a few dozen Blu Ray Disks.This unit has serious issues when trying to back up a file that is over 2GB even after an update to the latest firmware, the device just freezes. I would not recommend this device for any one. Buy something else, something more reliable and robust."
1,Please be Clear,It would be nice if it were really explicit whether there are any drives included in this package...I infer from the price (and the lack of any mention of disks...?) that those are extra. But since I can't really tell I will move on and hope for something more helpful and less misleading.
1,stories of how wonderful I am,"Mr. Feign is a well known art dealer who has written a disjointed series of stories related in that they all involve him and some noble act or great art find by him. In many of the stories Mr. Feign is critical of collectors, dealers, and administrators of art museums who are now dead and unable to defend themselves. Richard the Great emerges as the only noble and knowledgable person who always does the right thing and always barely misses the gold ring of finding and acquiring a lost art treasure. If you are interested in an egomaniac's view of his life and the shortcomings of others, written in the guise of stories about art this is the book for you. The editor should be fired for not catching the number of duplications of facts and typographical errors."
3,Name Droppings - Views from the Bottom of the Cage,Gossip and other matters previously reported by others. Too bad the author did not say more about modern art.
5,Beautiful book.,"I, too fell in love with Secretariat and the sport of horse racing as a young, horse crazy girl. I am proud to own this one and William Nack's ""The making of a Champion"". The photos are beautiful, also. It gives you an up close look at the process of developing a world class athlete. This book is a great tribute. Secretariat will live on in our memories forever. I miss him."
5,This book is great!,"This book is great and chock full of beautiful, rich, and colorful photos; Secretariat almost looks real in some of them. It has just as much accurate information as Bill Nack's ""The Making of a Champion,"" but doesn't go into the tedious detail of related bloodlines and the syndicate deal made for Secretariat. I found this book to be better than Nack's because of that, the pacing, and the gorgeous photos."
4,Secrateriat book,"This is the second book I read on Secretariat. It filled in some gaps from the movie and the first book.I remember the Derby and the Preakness but for the life of me I cannot remember why I missed the Belmont.After having seen the movie and learning of the time period, it raised some interest on my part and I read all I could about the horse, the trainer (Eddie), the Chenery's. I enjoyed this book."
3,Real good pictures but a little too much hero worship.,"I loved Secretariat. I was a young man that had watched my heros get killed in the 60's. Watching this great horse run inspired me and helped me believe again. The book brings back memories, but I think Secretariat was bigger than horseracing and his story needs the context of the bigger events of this era."
3,Good album - just not Triumph,"I found little similarity between this and the rest of the Triumph albums. It's still a good, hard-driving rock album I'm enjoying; however it's not the same Triumph (obviously). Even as they morphed here and there throughout the years and some albums were received better than others, there was always a baseline consistentcy that said ""Triumph."" Miss ya, Rik."
2,Lost the main talent,"This album proves that Rik Emmett was the driving force of Triumph and the most adept musician. Although much heavier sounding than any other Triumph work, the songwriting and musicianship is flat and uninteresting. The production values are decent and one song made it to a movie soudtrack (Hellraiser III) This work is OK if you think of it as a different band with the same name, but it can't compare to any other Triumph album and it's a good thing that they called it quits after this."
4,Unnerving,"This book is written as though the main character, Gabriel Anderson, had wrote out his experience and I (as the reader) am reading his words. It all takes place in Rome, Georgia. Gave does not work, has a wonderful girlfriend, and no major problems. When his headaches and nose bleeds begin he ignores them and ends up in the hospital.A male figure in the shadows talks inside Gabe's head and Gabe can see evil, dead beings. No one else can see them though. People around him are dying horribly and many believe Gabe is the killer! Is he?Here is a book that will make you wonder and leave you feeling very uneasy! ****"
4,Deaf Culture,I watched this in a class and wanted to rewatch it. A must see! Great video! Great outlook on deaf culture!!!
5,"An ""Eye Opener""",This movie was so moving and really opened my eyes to a wonderful culture. I am an interpreter for the deaf/hh in a small town in Wyoming. There is very little Deaf culture to be found here so this wonderful documentary was a joy to watch. I learned so much and the information given in the film sparked new conversation within my family and with my colleagues. 5 stars!!!
3,A Machine Generated Text,"The 1998 edition of this book was generated by a machine....as far as I can tell. It looks like a phone book, with the tiny print to match. Serious programmers will need the Java Class Libs vol 1 and vol 2 as well as other books for the javax packages and java3d, etc.The book is very compact, and does a nice job of compiling many classes together in one binder. It is only occasionally useful to me.Cute size!"
2,Not useful to me,"I'm a hardcore Java developer. I develop non-trivial client/server applications 10+ hours a day for a living. The concept behind the book sounded useful. I was wrong. A big listing of classes and method signatures is not useful. How is...Socket: public void setOOBInline(boolean on) throws SocketException... helpful information? It doesn't aid me in finding the method I need to do something, it doesn't aid me in figuring out what a method does... it doesn't help me to understand how to use a class or method, it is just raw information.Browsing through the on-line javadocs are far easier and more productive for me. If you want a good Java reference book, the ""Java Class Libraries"" books are FAR more useful (and I highly recommend them)."
3,"Good for, if you don't have IDE tool.","Volume 1 covers java.beans to org.xml packages useful for server side development.Volume 2 covers java.applet to javax.swing packages useful for developing GUI application.This is is a review for Vol. 1.This book is not for begineers or not for learning A Java.This book is a good reference bookfor all the java Packages, Classes and Interface.Packages is useful when you need an overview of a package or what other related classes areavailable in a package.Classes gives complete detail of the ancestry of the class and a list of every member in theclass.This part is useful when you're already working with a particular class and want quickreference to all of the members in the class.It has lots of hands on examples, which are very useful for finishing a particular task like,reading a file, sending a socket etc. like programmers need some basic routines,while coding.I recommend this book for those, who does professional coding and need to in touch with API."
2,"concise, yet disorganized","The Java Developer's Almanac is basically a gigantic listing of the majority of Java 1.2's classes and libraries. The book is lightweight and as dense as your average dictionary, which is great when all you're interested in is finding that certain special method. Unfortunately, it also resembles the first edition of O'Reilly's Java in a Nutshell, which means it could use some improvement. The returned-by and passed-to information (absolutely essential for finding relationships) is stuck way in the back of the book. And all the classes are alphabetized by name rather than package, which leaves a lot of completely unrelated classes next to each other. In short, get O'Reilly's Nutshell first."
3,"Cheap book, though not the best!",Not really the best quick reference. Since it is cheap there is no harm in buying it.
4,"A nearly flawless DVD set, compared to the rest","I received my copy yesterday, and browsed through it. I didn't expect to find any flaws, but ... brace yourself ...I found that shows #6-#8 (Mucho Loma) are all TIME COMPRESSED, with frame blending and a pitch increase throughout the whole program.Thankfully, this does not apply to the rest of the episodes on the set.I have not seen this on any other R&B; release; I suspect the episodes appear this way because Classic Media is trying to save space on their discs when authoring and/or save money (yet they can fit ten episodes on one disc at the correct speed). I hope a DVD replacement program will be offered. For this so-called ""defect"" I give the set four stars instead of five.In the meantime, this is still a good set, especially for the bonus feature: an unedited recording session from ""Goof Gas Attack"" (well, not completely unedited -- there are a few bleeps). Also, at least I now have the complete series."
4,Great Final Season,"I docked this one star only because, even though the R&B; serials are new, the other material (e.g. Dudley Doright, Fractured Fairy Tales, Aesop & Son, Peabody, etc) are just reruns from previous series.But that is not a knock on the DVD release itself... I assume this is what was originally release. All R&B; are great. Although I am curious as to why the Fourth Season is so short... only 19 episodes.But this (5th) season contains a full 33 episodes. If you like Rocky and Bullwinkle, this DVD set is worth getting."
5,Great to See Final Season of a Great Series,"Given how long it has been since the season 4 set came out, I'm glad to see the final season of ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" come out on DVD. This is easily the best 1960's animated series, if not the funniest of all time. A must for any animation fan."
3,"Good, but small",You could do worse but the scale of this atlas is quite small. Symbols are hard to read under dim red light. Skypub's Pocket Sky Atlas is probably a better choice.
3,Too much,"This is a good book, it is highly devotional and not very pastoral or technical. It is somewhat dated also."
3,Peaches & Cream - 112,"UK CD Maxi Single Track Listing for""PEACHES & CREAM"" - 1121) Radio Mix - 3:172) Remix featuring Ludacris - 4:003) Radio Mix featuring P. Diddy - 3:512001"
2,But what about the Chicago Fire?,"If you're looking for a solid, factual, textbook-style, book on the Chicago fire, this work probably isn't for you. With chapter titles such as ""Reluctant Modernism, The Past a Present"", ""Derrick Time, Architecture, Memory and the Poetics of Ruin"" and ""Wright's Piano,Imagining the New Chicago"", this book deals with the authors opinion of the societal and intellectual effects of the fire. For example, ""...Chicagoans... indulged the apocalyptic rhetoric occasioned by the fire and to an extent were even flattered by it,...reluctant modernists who would gladly face the present as long as it was safely anchored in the past."" (page 57, paragragh 1) The good point about this book is that it is filled with pre and post fire pictures of Chicago. That's the only reason for the two stars."
2,No Log Book Pages,It is very nice cover. It was my understanding that sample pages were included with cover.I received no pages. I would not buy it again unless samples are included!Corlin
3,Where's the log?,"Nice leather cover. It makes a nice gift for a launch of a new boat. I purchased it for that purpose. However, it is expensive and doesn't come with the log! That needs to be purchased separately."
5,great workbook,This is a great series for learning English. The books are easy to use and enjoyable for the students.
5,All That Glitters,"Back cover reads:TELLING SECRETS CAN DEEPEN A LOVE.OR DESTROY IT.When Ivory Keene won a design contest that landed her a job at a prestigious fashion house in New York, no one could have guessed the secrets she hid so well. Even the company's owner, Curry Kells, drawn to Ivory by a desire neither could resist, saw only a beautiful, talented young woman whose fresh, exciting designs could make them both millions. As easily as lies can be told, he believed in her and her innocence despite the suspicions of others. Now, as fame and wealth lay within Ivory's reach, the one thing she shouldn't risk was the shared intimacies of an affair. But suddenly, all that she had been striving for her whole life-all the dreams she clung to so ferociously-seemed cold and empty without Curry's love..."
2,Won't Prep for the Exam,"I've been studying for the MCSD; I'm currently 3/4 of the way there. Although I've used the Exam Cram series of books thus far (with great satisfaction), the Exam Prep - Architectures book doesn't provide a lot in the way of real preparation for the test.This book demonstrates a lot of great skills to have but if you really want to pass the exam get the Transcender software and the Exam Cram book to fill in the gaps.On another note: I agree with a fellow reviewer that there are A LOT of errors in books sample tests."
2,MCSD wannabe in Louisville,"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK FOR THE PRACTICE TESTS AND CD. You will be sorely disappointed. The CD-ROM fails on almost all it's promises. In my case, the practice tests didn't even work and the solutions to the hands-on projects were fragmented and disjointed.Content wise, the book is a quick, simple introduction to the models but certainly won't give you enough of a basis for the test alone. You WILL need other preparation guides. You're better off buying the Microsoft Training Kit book."
4,S. Halgrimson,I have found The Strip-Built Sea Kayak an interesting book. I have not been able to build a boat yet but plan to this spring. I have graphed the forms and found the book to explain it well. I hope the rest of the boat goes as well as the forms did.
1,don't buy the kindle edition,"i got the kindle edition and returned it the next day, the offset tables are small and cannot be enlarged so you can actually read them. so save yourself the trouble and get the printed edition. other than that, from what i looked over, it looks like the book has great information in it."
1,A poor rehash,This book like most other books on boat building is notable for its ommissions. There are so many I will mention only one.Most important perhaps - There is no method given to help you detemine if the boat you have constructed is structurally sound. You CAN follow the author's instructions and produce a boat which is UNSAFE to use in any location.
5,enriquecedor,"Es un libro muy interesante orientado a los aficionados al kayak y la autoconstruccion de cosas varias, hemana un espiritu optimista que contagia al lectgor.gracias a nick shade por su labor"
5,Excellent - why didn't I buy it before building?,"This is really an excellent book. I'm an engineer, and college professor, and publications like this are collector's items! I admire the completeness, and the very digestable writing style. Graphics are very clear and explicative. Only suggestion: the glossary should include a list of the tools and other technical terms."
5,"Kayak or canoe, this is required reading","If you are interested in building a strip built boat, either a sea kayak or a canoe, this book needs to be in your library. Nick Schade wrote a start-to-finish guide, from theory to practical application, about building these fine craft. He is an engineer by training, but he manages to write the book in an easy to follow, let me go clean my garage and get started style. The techniques he discusses are applicable to all light boats of this type, and can be applied to virtually any design. The only thing that might be a little intimidating is the drafting plots for the three designs... after all, he sells the plans for these boats as well.This book is also a detailed study in marine art... these boats are beautiful!-Chris Perkins, Canoe Builder"
4,A very handy technical back stop!!,"This is a very useful book in terms of getting a handle on wood strip kayak construction. It is well written, concise and clear. It suffers from some unfortunate americanisms (eg material suppliers, wood types, etc). There are also some areas like staple-less construction that are not covered deeply enough - but overall a fine addition to the books in this space.Richard RawlingAUSTRALIA"
2,Not the best bang for your buck.,"If you want bang for your buck, pick up Rachael's 365 book instead of this one. The recipes here are mostly found in that book as well. These recipes really aren't all that innovative, as far as kids recipes go (you already know how to cook hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches, right?), and the Rachael Ray 365 book has lots more information about altering recipes to suit your needs and other really helpful hints."
3,"Yes it's true, this book seems more of a cashing in on a trend.","It is true that most of these recipes can be found in Rachaels 365( highly recommend ) but the true charm of this book is that it's kid friendly. Some reviewers say who needs to know how to cook hot-dogs and cheese sandwiches? They are missing the point of this book, it's meant for the young-ones and my children(ages 8-11) love the simple recipes and really enjoy preparing their own meals. For the children I would rate it a 5, but for the adults looking for something new from Rachael they should look elsewhere. So my rating is a 3 taking these factors into consideration. Thanks..."
3,Will My Kids Eat It?,"Getting kids to eat food other than peanut butter & jelly, and chicken nuggets is a struggle for many parents. In this cookbook of kid food, Rachael Ray has tried to enliven children's' repertoire of foods to include eggplant, succotash, and lots of yummy green plants. As other reviewers have noted, however, be aware that this cookbook is a compilation of some of Rachael's previous recipes from other cookbooks. If you are a collector of her recipes, be sure to peruse this book prior to its purchase.Some of my kid's favorites include: Homemade Chicken & Stars Soup, Broccoli & Bow Ties, Sesame Noodles, Cashew Chicken, and Supreme Pizza Pasta Salad. Enjoy!"
2,not much kid food,I thought this book had some great recipes but most didn't strike me as very kid friendly. There were a few but not that many.
2,Not very useful,"I received this as a gift. There are just different variations of the same foods. How many different ways can you make a hamburger or a salad? And I don't think variations of salad all fall under the ""Top 30"" kid foods. There aren't enough recipes in here that are actually kid friendly."
4,adult supervision kid cookbook,"My 4yr old is a big Rachael Ray fan and I was excited about finding what I thought would be a ""kid"" cookbook for her. The size of the book is ""kid friendly"" as is the heavy card stock of the actual pages. But the food ranges in taste and isn't really geared towards kids, but rather grown ups who want a fancier version of food they enjoyed as a kid. Not a bad thing, but not exactly what I expected. If you are buying for the younger crowd, be prepared to change the recipes a bit to suit less developed taste buds."
1,The Necklace and missing short stories,"I bought this book because I needed it for my college English class, but when I went to use it I noticed thatIt was missing a couple of short stories. This version is different from the Dover edition that is also being sold on Amazon. Buy the Dover edition not this one."
2,You get what you pay for,"It is unfortunate that Guy De M is known in the USA for his short stories. They are well-written and were ground-breaking 150 years ago, but they do not age well. This translation is particularly poor and the Dover edition is so cheap and flimsy that the only thing good you can say about it is that it's cheap. And cheap isn't always the best value. For great French short fiction, try Emile Zola. De M's novels are great and age much better than this stuff. Historically they're interesting but have an O. Henry quality that doesn't work much anymore."
5,Great phone with clear reception,"This is the first Uniden phone I've ever purchased and it's being working great. I needed a phone with clear reception and an answering machine. This phone has both of these features. The phone system is actually smaller than shown in the picture but thats a good thing since I wanted a phone system that doesn't take up a lot of space. The reception has been excellent, clear and loud. The phone system was pretty easy to setup, I just followed the instruction on the manual. The only thing I kinda mind is that the buttons on the phone are kinda small. Overall, this is an excellent phone."
3,roots again,"having been to the cape town concert myself, and finding it one of the most memorable occasions i have been apart of, i was a bit dissapointed with the footage shown, as in the quality of sound and footage very dark as it doesnt give a true reflection of how good the concert actually was, the second part of the dvd in zennityh, is great, even though the quality of footage wasnt great, the music was awesome and winston is the master on stage, still worth buying in my eyes"
5,as good as it gets,This is way worth the money!!! Two shows and a great intervue. Buy it you wont be disapointed!
3,Burning Spear Live in paris DVD,This is not the full concert and the picture was not digitaly enhanced. Horrible. 3star
4,Very enjoyable!,This Korean War-era film has all the trimmings as far as aerial combat is concerned. This is one of the few films which approaches this aspect of the war.Kenneth Palmer
3,For fans of the F-86 fighter,"The plot is totally predictable, but interesting, set in a historical perspective. But it is the flying scenes of Korean war F-86's that make this DVD worth purchising."
3,Hunter,I was disappointed with the movie because its not what I expected. I had hoped it would be more centered around the dog fights rather on the strange love interest. Falling in love with a married woman is not what i had hoped for or expected. Mitchum is one of my favorite actors this was just not his best movie by far.
3,"Hot Shot ""Cowboy"" Pilots!","Fairly good Korean war film (there are not that many films about the Korean war) with some great footage of the F-86. The down side for me was when Mitchum crashed his own jet (a perfect crash!- odd) and Wagner was shot down. Neither man radioed his position. Now that is just plain stupid (no pun intended).But it DOES show the superior ""cockiness"" of the American pilot. Fighter pilots are a special breed and they know it. This film does pull that off."
5,the hunters,"outstanding Korean war jet fighter action. the combat scenes are very exciting and staged between F-86 Sabre jets and realistic mock-ups of Mig 15s using F-84 Thunderjets. the story line is easy to digest and definately romanticizes jet warfare. Robert Mitchum is a great anchor to the story, but the corny almost-love affair with one of his fliers wives could have been left out. Robert Wagner is a young brash beat-nick pilot who grows up quick after being shot down and evading capture. the movie is fun, realistic, and has some good action in it."
4,The Hunters,"My Dad did some of the flying in the movie, so that is why I got the movie. He was a fighter pilot. The movie was good. The flying was done over AZ and NV."
4,"A welcome addition to the ""War Library""","This is definitely a ""better-than-average"" war film, and is better than most of the Korean War oriented films. Robert Mitchum and Robert Wagner were perfectly cast for their roles in this fast-moving and exciting film. As is the case with other reviewers, I did not place much stock or value in the ""romantic sub-plot,"" nor did I intend to. The relationship among Mitchum, his wingman, and his wingman's wife was merely a catalyst for exploring how personalities and related behaviors play important roles in combat effectiveness. Also, the maturing of a cocky young pilot (Wagner) was an important, tragic sub-plot.I waited years to see this film to come out on DVD, and it ranks very well against other Mitchum war films, such as ""The Enemy Below,"" ""Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison,"" and others."
4,Al,"As a retired Air Force pilot, really enjoyed the flying scenes and the film featuring the ""sports car"" of jet fighters -- the F-86. Story a little corny at times, but overall very entertaining. Never get tired of watching it."
2,Nice flying sequences - shame about the plot!,"If you like watching F-86 Sabres pitching, yawing, rolling, shooting, and crashing then this film might be for you. There is plently of this as it was made in cooperation with the USAF.Be warned however:- This film contains an idiotic romantic subplot.- Robert Wagner's ""cool"" character appears to be from another film.- Chinese soldiers are portrayed as gibbering idiots.Watch ""The Bridges at Toko-Ri"" if you want to see a decent Korean War/USAF film."
4,freddy fender meet george jetson,"what an interesting timepiece.I just received this watch and the comments are just pouring in from friends and onlookers.In a word KAMPY. this watch is really turning heads with its futuristic avantgarde styling.Looks like a neck-less guitar from the future on the rist of a certain George Jetson.You be the judge.It is a bold timepiece, highly polished stainless case, very well engineered ,comfortable to wear. Watch looks to be durable.Croton always does great work!the chronograph pushers have a sapphire blue end accent not evident in the photos.If your looking to turn heads,then this may be your chance."
1,BROKEN,"We had this model for a month, my husband was wearing it and bumped the moulding if the kitchen door as he passed by. It stopped working. there is a reason it is discounted so low....don't buy it!"
4,Brings back memories!,"""Trilogy"" took me back to the '70s when I was in my teenage years. How incredibly tight was this group, Emerson, Lake and Palmer!"
4,The First Prog Album I Owned,"Although I would later discover better prog groups(Genesis, King Crimson, Jethro Tull)an elemetary school fascination with classical music back in '72 led me to ELP when I heard that they covered ""Hoedown"" from Aaron Copelands ""Rodeo"" which I had just heard in music class. This is ELP's finest album. Side one is near perfect,however ""Living Sin"" is a throwaway and ""Abaddon's Bolero"" is a good time waster, making the rest of this one fall short."
3,"Emerson, Lake and Palmer - Trilogy- CD","Bought this thinking I would know many of the songs, but turned out, the only one I know is ""From The Beginning"". Would have liked it better if there was more that I remembered."
2,"""Guys, you have run out of ideas""","This is what somebody should have told these guys before they released Trilogy. But who cares when everybody is crazy about symphonic-ish rock? They would buy the album anyway, right?This album contains many long songs. And I mean, long, like in loooooong. Even better, like in ""artificially stretched out"". It's not a matter of today's listeners having a short span attention as many dinosaur rock lovers would make you believe. It's just, the ideas on this album might reasonably cover five or six minutes of music. Everything else is filler -no matter how many Moog sounds you put into it."
5,Inspiring and unsparing!,"ELP's ""Trilogy"", despite reviews to the contrary by professional reviewers, remains, 25+ years after it's inital release, as a true definition of the trio. ""The Endless Enigma"" parts I/II are still works of art that can be listened to, over and over, without ever tiring the listener. The words and lyrics of this album demonstrate ELPs incredible range of musical interpretation and performance. Another Aaron Copeland salute, via ""Hoedown"" helps round this album out completely. Both ELP hardcore fans, and those just becoming acquainted with their works, cannot help but put ""Trilogy"" at the top of their list of ""must haves."""
1,SHM CD version of Trilogy,"This review speaks only to the quality of the ultra expensive, Japanese SHM CD version of Trilogy. Look for another version of this c.d.. The hiss that is present during and between songs is unbelievable. It is as bad as listening to an old cassette tape. I am blessed to own the MFSL version which I assume is still the gold standard of this c.d..I purchased this edition on a lark because it was touted that ""you won't believe it's the same c.d."". Well, they were right but for the wrong reason. This is a 10 star title that deserves better."
5,Superb/Classic ELP...,"I've heard this lp so many times, I thought I knew it inside and out, that is until I bought this MFSL gold version. It hands down blows every existing version out of the water. Sonically, you couldn't ask for a cleaner recording, very deep bass, crystaline highs and a very wide soundstage. A must-have for the serious ELP fan, if you can find it. Lucky me, I have one."
5,I Really Liked the Book,"""The World's Last Night: And Other Essays contains a number of C.S. Lewis's short essays and a Screwtape addition (I could be mistaken but I believe his wife did that one). The essay ""Lillies that Fester"" was interesting as it mocked the ideal of looking cultured and the Screwtape addition was pretty good (I considerably enjoyed and recommend the original book ""The Screwtape Letters"" as well). The most interesting essay was probably ""Religion and Rocketry dealing with what might happen if life was discovered in the cosmos. The essay ""The World's Last Night"" deals with the Second Coming and was a good read itself. Overall an interesting collection that I recommend."
1,This book should be pulled from publication.,"Wait untill 5th edition comes out or try Linux Secrets by Barkakati.I am going to throw this book away and replace it with somthing else,it is not worth the space it wastes on the shelf!"
1,Zero Info,This book was written by someone installing a distro and writing down notes. There's absolutely no info in here. If you get stuck then tough. There are many better books for beginners out there.
1,"Beginners, do not buy this book!","Like I said, don't buy this book if you think that you are totally new to Linux. I don't consider myself a computer novice, but, still, unclear and incompleted explanations found in the book only led me to confusion.Also, the old version of Linux, RedHat 5.1, is distributed along with the book. Better get a newer one!"
4,LIZARD install process is the best,"I read the book and installed and tested OpenLinux 2.2. The book is well written and does a good job of covering the OS.Caldra's OpenLinux 2.2 is an average distribution, but the LIZARD installation process is the best I have seen. The other Linux guys would do well to copy this technique. So far, I believe that Linux-Mandrake 6.0 offers the best release."
2,DON'T GET THIS BOOK IF U R NEW 2 LINUX!!! (you'll be sorry!),"Linux isn't exactly childs play! And this book doesn't help out either. It doesn't provide any complete information. The whole book is writen in notes, and it doesn't provide any details at all. Even the 3 CD's are somewhat incomplete. refrences provided are inconsistent with the book and CD's. For not knowing Linux, I must say this book kind of gave me a very scary intorduction to it! = ("
5,Go for this one,"Ive been looking through a lot of Linux deals on the web and Im convinced that this one is the best ive seen. The book is a classic which takes you through all the set up steps... and with latest versions of ALL the major distrobutions you cant really go wrong. Like we say, upgrade your Windows system to Linux today... I think you should try the included RedHat distrobution first, and you will see how much more power you get on the net and on your PC.Absolutely Brilliant... Go for it."
4,"good book, but lacking","I'm a 13 year-old kid in Tennesse exploring the world of UNIX/Linux. I picked up this book because of the 3 CD-ROMs, RedHat, Slackware and Caldera. The book is preety good, but could use more in Xwindows installation/useage chapters. The distributions are getting old, if you buy the book, go out and buy Redhat 5.0, I'm running Debian Linux I got from boot Magizine issue 15"
1,Not Worth a Star or a Review,If you have some understanding of Linux this book will make you even more confused.
2,How could this book be useful?,"While the back of the book says it is aimed at Intermediate to advanced users, the introduction claims that it is aimed at beginners.I have never used Linux much, and have recently installed a dual-boot system. The book mentions LILO, but is completely incorrect regarding its installation..actually..it doesn't cover the installation at all.This book has a very scatter-brained approach, and is incorrect far too often for me."
2,Don't buy it!,"This book is rubbish. Please do NOT buy it! If I had to rewrite the book, it would have been 40 pages instead of 900! The CD-ROM's that come with the book are rubbish to. You're better off buying Red Hat Linux at your local computer shop."
5,Excellent reference for beginner and expert alike!,"Very informative book. I have not yet tried some of the more advanced features like setting up a web server, mail server, ftp, etc., but this book makes getting up and running and performing basic functions a cinch! Book includes ver. 2.2 on CD, but I bought ver 2.3 to work with. Can't tell much difference on the surface. Installed perfectly the first time and detected ALL of my hardware properly and installed drivers right the first time--still waiting on a MS product that will do this. This version is unique in that it has a full-featured Novell Netware client, the setup of which the book explains very well."
3,"Covers as much as possible, but does not include details","This is book attempts to generalize as much as possible about Linux. It summarizes what is installed in a Linux system. However it is not meant for an adminstrator of an existing system. It provides no troubleshooting advice. This book may provide some assistance in studying for certification because of its broad, but not detailed information."
3,"interesting, but not moving or dramatic","Sills sounds like she is taking a stroll on the Easter Parade. Her sound is at times too sweet and gay, and her fioritura does not serve the dramatic (tragic) qualities of the character or even the music. Still for those who like sweetness this is a rather sweetly crazed and entertaining Lucia. ... The glass-harmonica sound is very interesting but not quite as eerie as I had expected. If it will be your first time buying a Lucia, get the Callas live Berlin perfomance (EMI) or the Sutherland studio (Decca London '71). Then get the Sills just to have it. Happy listening."
3,Sweet,"The opening chords and strains, the sextet and the mad scene. These of course are what I love about Lucia, though all of it is beautiful. I've had this recording for months and just listened to it today. I doubt I'll listen to it again. I have lots of Lucias, and no favorites. Though I especially like Sutherland's 1959 recording of the mad scene, it's beautiful, and her trills hadn't got muddy yet. I'm only going to comment on the mad scene in this recording. It sounds more like a lullaby than the ravings of someone who'd just murdered her husband. I was surprised, because I'd read (apocryphal) that Sills had said she'd pound tables and sing off key to get the drama out. I prefer bel canto coloratura to table pounding, I don't care about the drama. At all. Still, that said, I was both stunned and disappointed in Sills' mad scene. It was, well, flaccid. (I love Sills, am listening to the 1st disc of Sillsiana right now, and I have the Pons recording and do not think she chirped!)"
5,Just amazing!!!,"This is a great recording of ""Lucia di Lammermoor"". Everyone is involved and the conducting cannot be bettered. Get it now!"
3,So much vibrato,"I wanted to love this recording, but couldn't. So much vibrato in Ms. Sills rendering got in the way for me. A subjective opinion, I know, but there it is."
2,Recipes lack imagination,Nothing different about recipes. I was looking for something that had some other options or ways to use my pressure cooker
2,Not for dummies,"This book covers the way pressure cookers work, but he does not cover the electric pressure cookers which have been around long enough to have been included in his book. I did not feel the recipes were simple enough to be included in a Dummies book. Several were quite difficult to prepare. In the end, it seemed to be more of a cookbook with lots of recipes rather than a how-to-do-it book."
3,pressure cookers for dummies,"Didn't care for it, not to many recipes, and not good ones either. This also is for the older pressure cookers not eletric."
5,Pressure Cookers for Dummies,"With the purchase of my first pressure cooker, I also orderedthis wonderful book, Pressure Cookers for Dummies, from Amazon.I have other ""for Dummies"" books and know how good they are fromthat series. I may get other pressure cooking books, but thisone deals with understanding the basics of how they work, soyou learn how to use them properly. Plenty of recipes areincluded, also. I highly recommend this as your first book onthe subject."
5,This was a Christmas gift for a friend.,My friend simply loves this book and she is a nurse who doesn't really have a lot of time to cook so using a Pressure Cooker comes in handy for her and so does this book!
2,I'm the dummy for using this book!,I was so totally disappointed with the recipes included in the book. I have to admit that I tried only 3 but each did not go over with me or the rest of my family. I decided to quit while I was ahead. Other information included in the book is excellent but do not get this book for the recipes alone!
2,For smart dummies,"The book didn't answer a lot of basic questions for me, having never used a pressure cooker. It's O.K. as a supplement to other pressure cooker cookbooks, but I was hoping it would provide more step by step instructions.Very disappointing."
2,PRESSURE COOKER FOR DUMMIES,"THE BOOK WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN,IT TAUGHT ME A GREAT DEAL ON WHAT TO EXPECT FROM MY PRESSURE COOKER. I LOVE COOKING WITH IT. I CAN GO HOME AND IN 30 MINUTES I HAVE AN INDIAN CURRY. MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT I CAN'T SEE ANY PICTURES!"
5,quiltmaker,I am very pleased with the slow cooker. I use it a lot. I like the feature of the removable inside container. It is easy to clean.
2,pressure cooking for dummies,"It's an ok book I thought the shipping charges were way too high, for such a small item. I don't think any one would need this book, even for a first time user as myself. The intructions included in my cooker that I ordered were enough. I would not recommend it at all.Pressure Cookers for Dummies"
2,Not as good smelling as I thought.,Doesn't smell bad but not as good as I thought. Think I ordered the wrong Mont Blanc fragrance. Husband uses it though.
3,Gestalt refined,In his book Perla describes his concepts of an individual as an organism with basic biological needs. He carriages from Freud's co Celt of Hunger as sexual desire and states that as we eat to fill our stomach we all have needs to fill our soul. The soul is organic feature and by addressing needs from an organic basis we don't have the capacity to judge what people do. We can only understand that they are need of something from which they have suffered deprivation leading to such thing and neurosis and anxiety. His explainatio. And analysis of these emotional states on a needs basis is excellent and enlightened!Once you can understand these aspects and leave the hyperbole behind the rest of the book will be easier to understand. An enjoyable read!
4,Basic strategies,"This is a reveiw of basic strategies for behavioral pattern changes ,well worth investigating,if you are interesred in rapid transformation in behaviors."
2,hmmm...... where is my pointer?,"I took a look at the Japanese version of this book. Like what the previous commentator has said, it's just published source codes. I would recommend interested readers to read up these 2 books instead:Linux Device Drivers by O Reilly Linux Kernel Internals by Addison WesleyBoth are on kernel 2.0, but things remain relatively similar for kernel 2.4.3still exploring...."
5,pure graphic content,this has got to be one of the most amazing design book's i've seen and owned. Simple illustrations yet so expresive! i love it and highly recommend it.
1,"Not safe, bad paintjob",The toy is great but they could have used colored plastic rather than cheap paint. Take a look at my customer photos and you will see why I had to give this toy 1 star. Imagine seeing that after your kid played with this toy. I took my son to the Dr. just in case and he suggested a lead test. Thank god nothing was wrong but the least Leapfrog could have done was use colored plastic for the head.
2,Recycled Common Sense,"Although Willingham is a good story teller, it's clear that he hasn't been in the business of PROVIDING customer service since the 70's. Back then the customer was always right and businesses had time to make the customer happy. Today customers are more demanding and unreasonable. Time truly is money and it's getting harder and harder to go the exra mile when it means letting something else slide. Yet no one can afford to lose customers. The principles in the book are good: giving the customer your full attention, listening to them, making eye contact, inviting them back and so on. But there's nothing new here, and it needs to be updated for 2003. Come on Ron, get with the times and give us something we can use. Points for the quaint stories, though!"
3,Good start for study,"I ended up taking the ""Post"" Dispatcher exam. I found some of the study guides were applicable, but most were not. The parts that did mirror the test were helpful in getting my mind frame in the right place while testing on a time limit. Also some of the instructions were good to know in advance, such as the timed verbal testing which is designed to eventually go so quickly that no one can keep up. Knowing this ahead of time helped my overall confidence while under the stress of testing. I recommend it as a general study tool to get your mind in the right frame for the exam, although I can't say I gained great new knowledge applicable to the test. It's like they say, it's not exactly a test that can be studied for."
3,Very Helpful Study Guide,This book was very helpful in preparing for the Dispatcher test. It gave me a good general idea of what the test would be like.
3,Definitely Gave Me Food For Thought,"What I liked about this film was how excited Robert Bauval is in discussing his theories that he feels are facts. He talks about how in the distant past (10,000+ years ago) were men who were geniuses just like Sir Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein, though those wise men of eons ago didn't have science as the more contemporary geniuses did/do. Instead, they expressed themselves, their beliefs, their visions and theories through archeological structures (such as the Great Pyramids), and hieroglyphs that present day science can't fully interpret.Mr. Bauval goes into great depth exploring the links between the Orion Correlation and the pyramids, as well as many other theories about where human civilization ""truly"" began. True or not, it was interesting to keep an open mind while watching this film and wonder, ""What if?""I do wish there were more photos to explain what he talks about so it would be easier to comprehend as I'm a very visual person."
1,garbage !!!!!!!,im so sorry i purchased this video...bauval may be brilliant as a cutting edge archeologist but his presentation techniques are chaotic and he seems to ramble on about people not giving specifics in just about everything he spoke about. Problem is I cant even figure out what he WAS talking about. the sound quality was poor and the graphics even worse...pictures were shown with no rhyme or reason and absolutly no explaination or how they connected with what bauval was rambling about...he started to talk about the first time and then got lost with how his idea upset alot of people and the rest was just plain nonsense...then somehow the video starts talking about robin hood....what????the music was horrible...some head bangers screaming while i desprestly tried to find the beginning of bauvals lecture....should have known right from there that it was going to be downhill from there....dont waste you money....burn it first before you purchase this video
3,A Lesson in Alternative History,"This film really makes you question how much of hat we learned in history class was true and how much wasn't thoroughly researched. Of course, as with many of these conspiracy type documentaries, it is completely up to your own interpretation. The documentary features Robert Bauval, who also directed the film and is a well-known figure in the world of ""alternative history"" theorists. The film presented some interesting evidence to question the roots f civilization but I have to say the film got off to a bit f a slow start. The biographical introduction of Bauval was a tad lengthy but it does pick up after that. Archaeology, anthropology and Egyptology enthusiasts, as well as conspiracy theorists will all enjoy this microscopic look at civilization."
3,Poor Value for the Cost,"The instructional method is effective for beginning speakers of Spanish, and the focus on practical everyday language is good. However, the tape set appears to be incomplete in that lessons are referred to which are not covered, and the last tape ends in the middle of a lesson. The written guide I received seems to be excerpts from a more comprehensive book. I expected more coverage for the cost of the package."
4,Durable,"I bought this to use it in a competition, but I ended up not using it because we couldn't get the hang of it. Because it's small, it's hard to hold and play with your hands. If you do get the drum, make sure you get the drum mallets with it. Otherwise, it's very difficult to play. On the other hand, I had my brother bang it with spoons and pens and it hasn't ripped or broken, so it's durable."
1,Most inaccurate account so far.,"Hammell has quite a large number of inaccuracies, slanted opinions, and has failed to verify facts from his sources. The book has a very negative view of the same US Army, whose sacrifice on the east side of Chosin undoubtedly saved the allies chance for withdrawal from Hagaru-ri and also provided the rear guard action for the evacuating column. Appears to be written more for personal glory and profit, than a source of useful information."
2,Maybe we just aren't a Stride Rite Family,"I don't know. I guess I feel that Stride Rites purposely size their shoes narrow so that they can tell you your child has a wide foot and you feel that you need to buy their shoes.My toddler ahs been sized at many places and the only place that told her she was a wide was Stride Rite. She wears all sorts of shoes; Geox, Lelli Kelly, Adidas, Primigi, and even Target shoes and she has no problem with pinching or the width but I purchased these in a regular width and she cried all day.I couldn't figure out what her problem was and then I took off her shoes and her little toe was pinched, red, and out of shape. Poor Girl!Maybe 2 stars is a little harsh. Just make sure you get your child sized at a local Stride Rite before buying online and chances are, unless your child's foot is really narrow, you should get the wide width to be on the safe side."
3,Just an ok shoe...,"Even the wides seem narrow in these shoes. They look good- but nothing special. These are now her back up shoes. For the price- I would buy something else, like see kai run or pippytoes."
3,Good Learning Guide - maybe to much for the exam though,"This book is more of a learning manual rather than a preperation for the VB Exam. It's a great source for someone with light VB Experience as the book goes in depth on several topics and the exercises really force you to know how to apply what you just learned.As an Exam Prep though, there are better out there. I strongly recomend New Rider's Training Guide for both VB Exams, the content is good and the organization is much better and accessible than this book.I use the New Riders' Book and then went back and did all the exercises in the Exam Prep to make sure I know how to apply the information, not just know answers to test questions. But if I could return this one, I would, the New Riders Training Guide is much better."
2,No corrections online for this book,"Chapter 5 contains a program using the tree view and list view. The program does not work correctly. There were no corrections or FAQ's for this book online, and it took me two weeks to get the author to write back and agree with me that the program does not work correctly. He said he will re-design it for the next version. Sorry, but that is not good enough! I can't wait until the next version to take the exam. To date, I have not received an answer from Coriolis - the publisher - as to why there are no corrections for this book online. Although the book is helpful, and covers the material I need to know, I will stick to O'Reilly and Microsoft Press in the future. They are better about providing corrections to programs that were found after printing. I am actually quite surprised the book was even published with this mistake. Just opening the program and using it for a couple of minutes would have shown that it just doesn't work."
2,Just OK,"Workable envelopes, however some of the clasps were misaligned, requiring the flap to be refolded."
5,"Great for oversize letters, inserts, or small presents!","I use these envelopes nearly every month! I prepare handouts and lessons for ladies I teach from my Church, and I mail at least 5 every month! They are a necessity in my household! I will keep buying them!"
3,Almost the definitive tale of Lord Soth,"Soth, the most mysterious, most menacing, character from the first two Dragonlance trilogies finally gets his own starring role in a story that describes how the man became the dreaded undead knight.The author attempts to create a Shakespeareian-like, Othello-esque story of a noble, honorable knight with a checkered family heritage who succumbs to his tragic flaws of pride and lust. Pretty impressive for a mass market paperback assumed to be targeted at the 12 to 18 year old age group.I believe it is that very marketing fact that limits the impact of Lord Soth. Having to pull his punches, dance around mature topics, and avoid adult themes, the author is prevenented from writing the story that could be. He does his valiant best to create a decent story but in the end the reader is left saying ""there could be more"""
2,It didn't do Lord Soth justice!,"The book, Lord Soth, I found to be poorly written and failed to explain and give good reason for Lord Soth's spiral downward into the depths of evil. The way the book was written failed to show the emotions of Soth as he committed his crimes. The author seemed to just skim over the important parts, such as the deaths of Lady Korinne, Isolde, and his two children. Even though any DragonLance novice knows the tale of Soth, this book failed in showing Soth's honour and true evil. Also the summary on the back of the book concerning Soth's quest given to him by Paladine is quite misleading since it lasts a whole chapter at the end of the book. The novel also didn't fully explain what evil magic transformed Soth and his loyal knights into Death Knights. Overall I found the book very uninspired and was disappointed by it. Weis and/or Hickman should have written the book as opposed to some novice."
3,Before He Was Evil,"Lord Soth was originally a Knight of Solamnia who turned evil- was it pride, lust or greed? His descent into darkness and evil is detailed here. He accepts a task from Paladine to redeem himself. He is a major villain in the War of the Lance, also featured more subdued in Ravenloft. It's kind of creepy."
3,Soth,"This book tells the tale of the events leading up to Lord Soth's mysterious change from Solamnic Knight of Paladine to Death Knight of Takhisis for those of us who have come to know him as Kitiara's creepy sidekick from the Chronicles stories. This book does not rank as one of my all time favorites in the Dragonlance series, but it is well worth reading just for the insight into Soth's character. Our favorite Death Knight can also be found in TSR's Ravenloft series in the books Knight of the Black Rose and Spectre of the Black Rose for those of you who want to know more...."
1,Why was this book even written?,"The problem with people writting books as additions to a series is most clearly defined in this book. Taking a great character like Lord Soth and then making a book with absolutely no plot, and lets not forget about how rediculousely boring it all was, was quite a feet for Edo. With his ""stellar"" record in the Dragonlance series, what with that book about Tanis' father having ""consentual"" intercourse with his mother, he definetely didn't need a ""blockbuster"" like this to establish his name. But seriously, find a new damn series to write for. I can't believe I wasted my time, not to mention my money reading this ""book."""
3,Could have been better,"First of all, I don't recommend anyone who is not a devouted Dragonlance fan read this. It does not follow the original story made by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. It might confuse some people, who do not know a lot about Dragonlance. Other than the inconsistencies in the story, it isn't a bad book. The story documants Lord Soth's decent into darkness very well. And the chapters in between the main story, which tell about the Kingpriest in Istar, are spectacular. I also enjoyed reading abuot the child Lady Korinne gave birth to. It is ashame Soth killed it. In my opinion, Lord Soth fans will enjoy this book. Anyone looking for a good horror tained soapopera will like it. Just ignore the parts where the author contradicted Weis and Hickman's version of the story."
1,Not What I Expect From Dragonlance!,"I Love dragonlance books... yep, read every single one. This was one of the hard to find ones. When I finally got it I ripped it open with the highest of hopes... I mean here's the death knight! YES!!! I read and then was truly disappointed. This book was pooorly written, it did not leave me wanting more like all of the others. DO NOT get this if you at all value good writing. In one part the author builds up to a big love scene between an elven maiden and Lord Soth.. and all it says is ""he took her in his arms and he loved her"". I mean, come on!!!"
4,Worth reading.,Pretty good. Accurate to the history of what happened in comparison to other lost history books. Well written considering any dragonlance novice knows the ending. Worth reading.
2,A poor accounting of an excellent story,"I have read nearly all the forgetton realms books and can honestly says this was one of the worst. The author took a character of epic proportions and failed to give a proper accounting of his story. The ending is weak, unimaginative and and fails to answer many questions."
4,A TRAGIC STORY,"This was indeed a very good book.It tells the story of a remarkable but very misunderstood man,Loren Soth, whose human weeknesses led him and his friends and family to their destruction.A pretty god reading especially if you are familiar with the dragonlance saga."
2,very misleading,"This book was good for awhile, but the author got away from the actual truth of what happened to Lord Soth. It was good though. I have also written a review for The Day of the Tempest, but the email adress is different. So if you would like to ask me questions about either you scould use the email adress on this review."
1,Nice hammer that will last a week or two,Head of hammer came off 2 weeks after purchase. Amazon would not stand by warranty and requested I contact manufacturer who after 10 attempts never returned my-mail. In fairness do not buy this product the head will fall off and there will be no one to take care of the lifetime warranty
3,mig alley,"If your a fan of early jet aviation like I am this film is a must have for your collection. There`s some very good Russian footage of there early migs not to mention the combat footage taken from the gun cameras of the american sabre jets. Most interesting is the Americans flying up to the Yalu river to bait the Russian pilots up for a showdown. Guess who wins most of the time? Vcr on, tape in, full throttle,gear up, lets go mig hunting."
5,In many ways superior to the original,"The Curse of the Cat People (1944) is not really sequel to Cat People (1942) as much as a stand alone physiological thriller that just happens to be an extension of the original characters. We have seen the formula before but you may not have seen such a presentation; a lonely child Amy Reed (Ann Carter) seeks a playmate that understands her. Who best but the spirit of Oliver's dead wife, Irena (Simone Simon) one of the cat people. Naturally this upsets the parents. Toss in Amy's new relation to reclusive neighbor Julia Farren (Julia Dean). Julia has problems of her own relating to her daughter. The story just gets complex from there.The question is, is it dangerous to fantasize that much and what will become of the characters in the end."
5,It makes me feel glad I'm a woman,"I think she is excellent. I love all her songs.I have been to two of her concerts, have all her video,and have a great Shania shirt which I only take off to wash.She is not only beautiful outside but inside as well. I really admire how she took care of her brothers when her parents died. How many young people would do that?"
5,Man I Feel Like Throwing Up!!!,This is the worst bull of a song I have ever heard. Just kidding SHANIA RULEZZZZZZ!!!!!!! This song is the best baby! Who can beat this COUNTRY Bombshell. Shania YOU go GIrl!
1,It Doesn't Impress Me Much!!!!,This song is not the most intelligent or the best she has written. It's kind of sad the way she releases two singles at the same time. One for VH1 and the other for CMT. Shania should stop using gimmicks and let her music speak for itself. She's a really good artist but she lets the business ruin her creativity.
4,Nice Cover,"We have had this about two months now and are pretty satisfied with it as opposed to the Weber grill cover we were contemplating buying. It was vinyl, this is double stitched cloth/canvas with a vinyl lining. Looks real sharp. Our only complaint is that we were advised by Two Dogs (reminds me of an old joke...) to get the 53"" long model for our Weber Spirit but it is several inches too long and drags on the ground. Eventually, it got caught in the cart's wheels and was accidentally torn by a laborer who moved it to work on our patio. We replaced it with a 53"" regular and the fit was perfect (5-6"" off the ground)although the price was around $20 more, for whatever reason. Oh, the color choices are a bonus!"
4,Strong canvas and easy velcro straps.,I bought this grill cover for the new grill I bought from Lowe's.After checking the measurements on the new propane grill it was time to shop online for a durable grill cover since Home Depot and Lowe's had cheap material covers at the stores for a hefty price.This cover was easy to go over the grill and with wth front and rear velcro straps it fit tight around the grill bottom for those high wind days of Winter in Northeast N.Y.
3,"It's cute, but it ain't waterproof or weather resistant","It fits well, it's cute but when it rains, the grill gets sopping wet. I'm waiting for a dry spell long enough to dry the cover out, then I'll waterproof the seams and spray it with waterproofing spray. Too bad. I really like the way it looks."
5,great cover!,"I bought a HUGE BBQ & needed a 'huge' cover. This one is it ! Great design to fit perfectly so easy to get on & off. (Before I would let my poor 'ol BBQ just sit in the weather cuz it was such a hassle to put the cover on.) Very heavy canvas material, & so far no issues with color fading like I read in other reviews. I love it & recommend it highly !!"
4,Tight Jazz for Uptight People,"John Lurie knows how to lead a band. The Lounge Lizards play well together under his leadership, each contibuting a small piece to the whole. Though his sax does occasionally shine, the band as a whole is the focus for this album, as shown by the last tack, which features a narrative (spoken by Lurie) that ties this theme up and sends it back home. Jazz for quiet drinking."
3,Too advanced for the average Joe,"When I saw this book, I thought I had found a book that would explain Superconductivity in a manor that I could experiment with in my spare time. Obviously this book is written for those who have a good background in Theory and college level math; not the weekend garage inventor. With so many formulas to swim through I was lost in references that I had never heard of, not to mention could even put to use with my limited knowledge of the subject. For those out there wanting something simpler, look for a book with more illustrated pictures of the formulas in action and not entire pages of numbers, sub-typed Greek letters and squiggly line graphs."
4,I have never read your books before. but I heard.,I am interested in superconductivity and diffusion of superconductivity. I am studying superconductuvitiy and elektrodiffusion.
5,Totally Awesome and Constantly Overlooked!,"This is a great 80s slasher film with extremely gory kills and lots of feel-good 80s teen horror schlock. There's a new wave synth pop soundtrack, pre-marital sex, drugs, and ridiculous dialog. I laughed out loud. The pacing is decent and kept me entertained. It deserves a DVD release! Watch for Ted Raimi selling condoms near the start of the film."
4,"Bloodrage, aka Nightmare at Shadow Ridge","I agree with all of the comments totally. Now, if anyone can find the DVD on the Legacy label. Very rare, and from what I hear, excellent quality. Also, no one mentioned that Louise Lasser (Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.)is in the cast. For trivia, her character's name is also Lasser."
3,How I See It,"This tripod dolly takes some time to get use to. Make sure that you use it on a smooth surface, if not you will have complications with your shoots."
4,"""Lead by example""",Mr Toth's book is well thought out and well presented. Good examples are used to highlight key concepts. This book gives a very good understaning of Linux networking without going to deep. For me it bridges the gap between a beginners 'Dummies' or 'Idiots' guide and an 'Unleashed' mammoth.
2,from dumb to so-so webcam,"This is such a dumb webcam. The construction is okay, at first, but before too long the camera part just flops around on the stand and becomes impossible to point. Utter fail when trying to install under Vista, which probably rules out Windows 7. I was able to configure it under Ubuntu Linux, then learned that the camera element is mounted UPSIDE-DOWN in the unit.Update February 2010: I did manage to find a current Vista/Windows7 compatible driver for this webcam. It is on the Trust products site, search on 14383, you will be taken to the support page for a better looking product WB-3400T that apparently is compatible with this webcam. For Rev. 2 of this product, you want the driver for 14383 (no extension, though you may want to try 14383-02 and 14383-03 if the 14383 fails, who knows?). It does okay with the proper support, I will look at the products from Trust when it comes time to replace this so-so webcam, but for now it works (still UPSIDE-DOWN, but ah-well)."
2,picture qaulity,"bot Target Store And picture was not clear. no zoom, it seemed dark I couldent even see my self in it. I took it back to target and just said for get it. who am I trying to be pretty for Nobody.I dont really need it now. but if it dosent good picture why waste the good hard earned cash on money to servive in this over priced economy. wait till I have money and I have credit cards payd off before I go buy a nother one. I rate cam a 2. because on a sunny day couldent see my self on this cam other couldent see me. good luck"
5,Very Interesting and Detaile,"An interesting and thorough study of the tide changes. Always thought it was the moon but after reading, have a solid understanding of the various factors that influence tidal movements, frequency, elevation extremes, etc. Some of the explanations get rather involved so appeal would be limited to those that really want to understand."
2,poorly organized + written,"excellent photos.a fascinating period, the pre-surrealist era. not much has beenpublished about de chirico's brother, alberto savinio, musician, poet, and painter, who contributed more to de chirico's development than commonly known.unfortunately this book is marred by poor organization and writing. after developing interesting thoughts, baldacci then admits that there is not evidence to support his suppositions...""probably"", ""if"", ""doubtless"", ""we can even imagine"", and so on. i've read better papers by undergraduates. better writers would summarize where baldacci chooses to drag in long, diffuse quotations.baldacci is fascinated by unknowns about de chirico. much about the past may remain unknown, a fact of life."
5,Exceptionally Clear and Informative,By far the clearest 'How To' book I have ever read. The writing is always informative at ever step. Definite thumbs up!!
2,out of date,It's a good book but is a few years old so the material is dated. I wouldn't recommend it.
4,A great read,"This is a very helpful book to those who want to learn to build a pc. It has somewhere near to 200 illistrations to help guide you along, and it is easy to read."
2,"basic items,basic knowledge,procedures:lacking,tech needed","Mr. Rosenthal; doesn't tell reader about the extra procedures, computer items, & extra knowledge needed. I had to have technical help constantly. Told more about pentium. Didn't tell of others & their differences. No mentioin of certain other items needed, such as rear fans,etc. How cables were hooked together & you received extra cable. The I\O sheild had to be removed & inserted back 5 times. Line up of knock-outs with cards before this procedure of (using hand, better) takeing apart & get these items out. Save These. Other items & procedures along with no complete basics - hurts the first time PC builder."
4,very useful for the price,"This is an inexpensive book, and for the price you get a lot of good practical knowledge. My goal was the following. After buying a brand new computer complete with trimmings I wanted to get some more use out of my old computer. I run Windows on the new and Linux on the old -- I need both OS's and prefer to avoid a dual boot system. After researching in this book and on the web I decided to buy a minitower with motherboard (a ""bare bones"" setup) and to re-use the monitor, keyboard, mouse, disks, network card, and CD-ROM from the old computer. This book gave me the confidence I needed to plan and perform this job. It worked fine, and my refurbished old computer became far more productive. The money I spent on the book was recovered several times over."
5,The cover and title of the book is impressive.,"Please help me, I am from Malaysia (South East Asia). I want to buy this book but I dont have a credit card. Could you tell me any other mode of transaction. Or is it in the market in the Asian region."
3,There are better films of this play,"Firstly I'd just like to point out that on the box it says: ""Staged as seen in the 16th century"". In fact 'The Tempest' wasn't even written until around 1610/11, the 17th century, and thus it's highly unlikely that it was seen in the 16th.This is a brilliant play, which has been adapted more successfully to film in the following versions:- The Tempest, director: Derek Jarman, 1979- Prospero's Books, director: Peter Greenaway, 1991I wouldn't reccommend viewing Greenaway's version unless you have know the play quite well as it's a very artistic interpretation, and doesn't lend itself to storytelling, it's more preoccupied with the specifics of Prospero's 'art' (i.e. magic)."
4,Authentic production of The Tempest,"This was a very entertaining production of Shakespeare's play. I particularly found Ariel's character very true to the qualities of 'airy spirits.' The costumes of all the characters were well-done. I was not as keen on the parts with the jester and drunken butler as I was with the other characters, but overall, the scenes were played well. For anyone who has never had a chance to see a stage production of The Tempest in a style close to the original play, this would be a good introduction. Though some people may find Woodman's production of The Tempest banal, it could be very appealing to fans of Shakespeare's time and history, not just his plays. If you only like lavish sets and modern ideals of stage productions, this edition may not be appropriate, but it need not be for the masses; only for select fans."
1,Tempest review,Extremely disappointing. I was hoping to share some scenes with my students to help them understand the play. I'm afraid I would turn them off Shakespeare entirely if I showed them even a touch of this version.
2,wacky,"this movie is a recording of the play. The sound is a little off, but it is extremely accurate. I watched it for a ckass and suffered through it for the accuracy, follwing with the book. It is a weird story to begin with , but waching it in play form was slightly boring."
2,Not What I Really Needed,"I bought this book to solve the seemingly impossible, how to survive the hard spots and find secret escapes or avoid things altogther. The book is good, but it has none of that in it. Instead it tells you what you already know, run here, jump there. There are no cheat codes, or insight into how to make the bad guys go away. The book just offers what I had already figured out, doing the things required is another matter entirely. If you have the reflexes of a lab rat on huge quantities of caffeine you can do as the game requires, and the book reiterates. Otherwise it won't shed any light on more than some hidden levels, but those could've been found eventually without the book. Nice book, well laid out, but not very useful ultimately."
2,Just Okay,"Always on the lookout for different writers, I was excited about reading this book. Unfortunately, the story line did not fulfill the promise of being about Matilda. Instead it was more of the same about William, and not as well written as I had hoped."
1,Pity the English Horn!,"It turns out that recordings of solos by the English Horn are very scarce. I took a chance on this one, because I needed something that would let my music-appreciation class hear what an English Horn sounds like.Unfortunately, this recording sounds like what you'd get if a rank amateur was getting the audio feed from an over-used 78-rpm recording. Noisy; scratchy; fading in and out -- the soloist and accompanist played well enough, but the audio quality was pathetic.I managed to play the class one number on this CD, but I shall not be using it again."
3,polka dot dress,"dress was obviously cheaply made, very thin fabric - this was not included in the description"
2,Stanback..NOT AS ADVERTISED,"The ad picture clearly shows a Stanback package with the ""ORIGINAL FORMULA"" logo. Do not be fooled by this ad. Stanback has dropped its most expensive and essential ingredient from its formula and calls it ""improved"". Sorry folks, it is not improved. Take a grinder and grind up a coup[le of cheap asprins and you'll get the same effect. Stanback is now, nothing more than powdered asprin with a little caffein thrown in a speed up the asprin. They had an excellent product but have cheapened it for the bottom line. BC did the same thing. Only the consumer is holding the bag. Let the buyer beware."
2,An Article Wrapped in Extra Pages,"A lot of books, for all they teach, are actually over-stated articles. But since books are more profitable, writers and publishers prefer them. So you wade through all those pages of a book, only to realize you've learned as much as could have been covered in a less time-consuming booklet. This is such a work. The author does offer a sensible program for getting in shape, but he cloaks it in a lame story. Is it worth the money? If it motivates you to get and keep in shape, yes. You may like it. I got awfully bored."
2,Painful Writing,"I don't often take time to review a book, and I was raised on not saying anything at all if I couldn't say something good. I'll admit I haven't tried the workout routine in this book. I couldn't even make myself read it. The contrived story got in the way. This could have been a very short book. I'm returning my copy."
5,I'm a believer!,I just started my third two-week cycle of the Joe X workout and can't say enough positive about it. I'm in pretty good shape but was looking for some help. East+West is best! Hunnicut has got to be a master psychologist the way his workout is scripted. He says the challenge is not physical but mental and he's EXACTLY right.
3,"Pretty terrible writing, but...","The writing will make you cringe -- it sounds like a high school student wrote it -- and ""your"" is several times spelled ""you're"", but it purports to give one an approach to working out that you won't get sick of and quit. Anything is worth finding that, but I haven't tried it yet, so I can't testify to its efficacy."
4,excellent if different read,"I really enjoyed this book, but dont go into it expecting your typical exercise/fitness approach. For one thing there is an actual fictional story told throughout to drive the pricipals across. I actually think this difference is what makes the book effective, in that it targets those of us who don't have the time or energy to devote 2 hours a day to the latest fitness fad. Highly recommend it to those looking to be body healthy at any age!"
5,Melancholy gem,"Whistling along with these sad tunes for the thousandth time ... This little-known album is pleasure made of twisted tango and beautiful bandoneon (plus piano, violin, guitar and bass)."
3,Good Quality but not in love,"These are pretty good quality, the color is a little different. I am not wowed mainly because I don't love the color but the price was good."
5,"Beautiful, Sturdy Plates","I purchased these to replace some other stoneware plates I broke. Those plates were not being made anymore so I was in a quandary looking for something that would somehow go with my set. Luckily these Waechtersbach blue plates are the exact blue as the trim on my others - so it worked out perfectly! They seem to be of pretty good quality, made in Germany - you know they don't make cheap stuff!"
1,Horrible,Complete waste of money. Totally without any redemptive qualities. The person that developed this should be made to endure festering bedsores.
2,Nice try but sloppily tech edited,"I really wanted to like this book mainly because there has been nothing like it for Delphi. The algorithms hare handled competently enough and the breadth is all one could ask for in an introductory book. The code however is pretty bad. It shows that Mr Stephens converted it from Visual Basic and that he doesn't have enough Delphi knowledge (eg using / instead of div, integers are NOT 2 bytes). It isn't Ready-To-Run by any stretch of the imagination. There are some annoying lapses in the text as well (a nice chapter on hash tables but nothing about hash functions?). As far as I can tell no tech editing was done and it shows. Nice try."
5,Very informative,Reviewing music is a subjective task. Bloomenthal admits that. He gives an honest attempt to point out some of the most significant pieces from selected composers. With this guide you won't have to waste money experimenting.
3,Love It!,"I really didn't care too much for anything Britney has put out from this new album, but when I heard Toxic, I was relieved, this is the Britney Spears I'm used to. The original version is great in itself, and I couldn't wait for the maxi-single to be released. i just recently got my copy and loved the fact that there is an instrumental track. The best one is Armand Van Helden Remix- But I don't understand how Bloodshy & Avant can even can even call itself a remix-all it is is just the original song with just a little more bass and drums-it sucks. But it's still worth it."
1,thank god for america future pop artist like this!,"and I think the god must be crazy with a crappy music quality like this!she is not a singer, she is not able to write, play and read the scores/Music. She is an entertainer! The problem is: you can't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today. Who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years?PS: pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos!!!Thank god for america's future pop artists like this one!"
4,"It's not the best song, but It gets you singing along.","At First when I Kept hearing it on the radio, I changed it very quickly, but believe it or not, I am playing it over and over after seeing the video. I think the music videos explain the song more. It's fun, check it out."
3,It's ok.,"Ok...This song is really lame. The lyrics and her so called singing sucks as well. However, I like the remixes so much better than the original song. Britney is exremely mediocre, her ""music"" sounds all the same. She tries way to hard to be like Madonna. I recommend you go pick up something that's worth your money."
5,Who would've thunk it?,"Now, I am by no means a Britney Spears fan. She has some good songs, but they're nothing more then good. Me Against the Music was an okay song. And then I heard this song. I forget what I was doing, but I just stopped dead in my tracks when I did. I couldn't believe that this was Britney. I was amazed. This song is totally unique from anything Miss Spears has ever done. With the screaching vilions, catchy as hell beat, infectious chorus, and everything in-between, all make this song amazing. Even Britney doesn't sound half bad. Definitely a future #1 hit, and rightfully so."
1,Detoxifying.,"This is a terrible single for a decent, catchy song. Sonically, the remixes fall flat because they do not really suit the song. If you want a really good remix, download K.O.'s Level 5 Toxicity mix instead of buying this."
5,Amazing!!!!,WOW This song realy Intoxicated me I can't stop listening to it its like a ear worm ha ha its a realy realy great song!Seriosly this song deserves all the plays on the radio as much as any other song!This is easly crowned in my book the best POP/Dance song in the past 5 years for me!The single has amazing remixes that you cant sit down and listen they make you get up and dance thats what it did to me!:)If you like this song then you would love this single and her In The Zone album which is amazing check that out also!
1,Britney,hi (...) and i think that britney is a bad influince her music is unbaribale and she is not a good influince on little kids. one time she was on stage and she played with her self and was unclothed! do u think that is a good influince?
1,Waste Dump Britney,"Arguably, I really think that when it comes to a manufactured Madonna out there now, nobody seem to be a mimic other than Britney Spears. Her music is just as tasteless, and foolish like a man eating fire from a fireplace. This song is really one of the worst songs out there. The song, Toxic really smells like it is just tasteless trash. It really seems to sound exactly alike from all her other hit songs, a bitterfully big, disgraceful miss. I really think she has to really grow up and find another triumph in her belt, other than her eratic songs and behavior. I really hate this song. It is just one of the worst songs ever for 2004."
1,You are all hollow,"Just like this hollow vocalist, she's like a f*in cardboard tube filled with a little bit of silicon. Music is a form of art. This means absolutely nothing. Art that means nothing is bad. THIS MUSIC IS BAD."
1,PUT THIS TRAMP OUT OF HER MISERY,YUCK THIS IS AWFUL.I FELT SICK TILL MY EARS AFTER LISTENING TO THIS TERRIBLE SINGLE.THIS IS ABSOLUTE RUBBISH AND IS AN INSULT TO THE WORD MUSIC.STAY AWAY FROM THIS TRASH.GET ANY JANIS JOPLIN CD INSTEAD.
2,One of Britney's worst singles,"I really hate this song; Britney's vocals are shrill and breathy, the lyrics are banal and trite (the whole ""love or lover as a drug"" metaphor has really gotten old), and the production is bland with the James Bond hook being incredibly obnoxious. The song isn't even remotely catchy and it's a major disappointment coming from the usually excellent Cathy Dennis."
5,~*BRITNEY~SPEARS*~,I LOVE BRITNEY SPEARS all of her new CD's and DVD's ROCK ther AWSOME! i think everybody in the world should go out ther and buy the Britney Spears CD SHE ROCKS and if you like relaxing music it's on the cd if u like pop music it's on the cd eney kind of music this cd has it so go out ther to HMV and buy THE ZONE CD I RECOMED IT TO ALL !
3,Toxic isn't so Toxic,"Okay, I love Britney!!!! She is an awesome performer!!! The first 2 songs on the single, (Toxic original version, and kareokee version) are really kewl!!! But the remixes suck, no offerse, but Britney should fire the people that mixed those!!! This is a good thing to have n e ways cuz they only make so many singles, after a while they run out, amd get a few cuz u no in a few years EBAY might be calling your name!!!"
2,On the Cheap,What the heck is wrong with The History Channel? They re-cycle all of the video graphics and scenes into ad nauseum. They have several hours of programing that can be rightfully pared down to less than an hour.
2,20 Minutes Of Content Stretched In 45 Minute Episodes,"I love the topics covered in this 7 episode collection, even if most really aren't about storms per se.But...After every commercial break, obviously not shown here on DVD, there's a recap of what was just discussed just a few minutes before... something we expect if a show was continued from the week before. Does the History Channel think we all have ADD? Is it a way to grab the attention of channel surfers?But when it's a continuous episode, the repetition of content/graphics within each episode gets to be a distraction then extremely annoying. How many times do we have to be told the same scientists are out to prove the same theory! WE ALREADY KNOW THAT!Each episode is really 20 minutes of content stretched into an hour show. I can't give this collection more than 2 of 5 stars. Best borrow the series from your local library than waste money on this collection."
1,DISPLEASED,HOW CAN ANYONE ORDER A PRODUCT WITHOUT ANY INFO ABOUT IT?? THIS CD DOES NOT GIVE YOU A LIST OF ANY SONGS.....OR A SAMPLE TO LISTEN TO. I WOULD NEVER BUY A PRODUCT IF I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT!!
4,SpongeBob Bed,"My grandson enjoyed sleeping on the bed. It was easy to assemble and set up, and even easier to take down. Recommended for your little ones who come for a visit to Grandpa's house."
1,Out of date!,"Published in December 2000, this book cannot be current. MSN 7 was replaced by MSN 8 recently (I write this in Feb 2003). We need a replacement!"
3,Good but out of date,"This book has great information on antimicrobial drugs. It is what is allowing me to pass (I hope) my chemotherapeutics class. While the information is presented well it was published in 2000 and drug resistance has changed in 8 years, and new drugs have been released. I hope Scholar/Pratt release a third edition. Overall an oldie but a goodie."
4,Good value for the money,Wrench seems to be good value for the money. Torque is consistent with my Menards 150Ft-Lb torque wrench. Successfully used this wrench to tighten front axle nut on Accord (180 Ft Lbs). Planning to use it for crank shaft pulley when timing belt replacement time comes. It is also easier to tighten lug nuts (80 Ft Lbs) with this wrench instead of smaller 150 Ft Lbs one. The reason I gave 4 stars is ratcheting direction switch broke when wrench was used in reverse. That axle nut was incredibly stubborn though. Was only able to loosen it with Snap-On impact. Seller replaced wrench for free.
3,good wrench,"While I havent gotten a chance to use this wrench. It looks to be built pretty decent. I like how on the adjustable ft/lbs, it has a lock to keep it from slipping out of the desired torque setting."
2,A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT,"On a recent walk, through field and wood, here is Southern Missouri, I was able to identify only six of the 34 flowers I encountered. Either the plant simply was not in the book, or the picture quality was of poor detail. Actually, I cannot completely fault the author for this, but rather the Missouri Conservation Commission, who has been doing things sort of half way for years now. Pity. In the introduction of the book, which should be read carefully before purchase, someone has stated, if reference to the large number of flowering plants in Missouri, that ""Even this figure should not scare the amateur because many groups (genera, have so many species that only an expert could possibly take an interest in identifying them.....""Now that is academic arrogance at it's best! Perhaps it would be better to retitle this books as ""A Very Fragmented Overview of Missouri Wildflowers."""
4,Solid Foundation,"If you are looking for a place to start building basic sensor circuits, and have some experience with electronics, this book is it. Although not the whiz-bang smart home technology of today, this book lays a foundation for building more complex home automation projects.Broken into chapters on:Types of SensorsTemperature Related CircuitsWater Related CircuitsLight Related CircuitsEnvironmental Concerns and Specialized CircuitsThe book covers each circuit in an appropriate level of detail, and although you may reference your electronics dictionary here and there you will never feel out of your league. The book also provides a background to your environment sensing projects, by covering some basic concepts in Science."
3,The Future of Netwoks is the Future of the World,"The book is a complete reference to migrate from IPv4 to IPv6, remember this is the first books of this kind, helps very much if you work whit real networks or you are fan of Internet2.Rodolfo Z. Velasquez, Tegucigalpa, Honduras C.A."
1,"Jumping here, jumping there",With the exception of 2 or 3 chapters this book is a complete waste of money - too much useless information in a complete messy manner.
2,The Traveler Isn't Worth The Trip!,"Although Katzenbach has become one of my favorite authors, you can tell that The Traveler is only his second book.While the story is interesting, his dialogue is weak and he doesn't move the story along at a fast enough pace. He's come a long way since The Traveler. If you like really good thrillers, try these books by Katzenbach--Hart's War (his latest), The Shadow Man and Just Cause."
5,A PEARL OF JOY,This is one of the most inspirational true stories I have found. Pearl has made a difference in more lives than he could ever imagine; he certainly did so in mine! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to be a better person.
4,Makes you wanna go home and trim something!,"This documentary is just so charming. It really shows you what's important in life, to do what you love, to find what you're good at and give it your all, and you most definitely will find happiness and inspire others.ps. I cant wait to go visit Pearl's garden !"
5,peace of mind,"one of my favorite albums ever,really underrated,but definitely a must to understand what life is really about.Gives me peace of mind,and soul..."
3,Rainbow Coloured Rap,"U really have to be in the ""PM Dawn vibe"" to listen to this cd. Alot of the tracks sound dated, like that 90's rap groove that takes u back to that era. It reminds me how rap music has evolved over the years. I like the beats and the music of PM Dawn but some of the rap is hippie drippie stuff and alittle bizarre. I'm sure the rap community probably dismisses PM Dawn as ""rap sissies"" considering most rap is hard, macho driven and ego trippin'. I give PM Dawn credit for taking the high road and remaining positive. They're music is introspective and spiritual. My favourite tracks are ""Paper Doll"" and ""Set Adrift On Memory Bliss"". Ironically the 2 hit singles off the album. I wish I liked more of the other tracks, that's why I give the cd 3 stars. It's still nice to hear PM Dawn on occasion takin' us back to the roaring 90's when life was good. Peace."
3,Music from my past,"Again, another crazy drunk night at our house, playing random songs/bands we all used to love when we were younger....had to buy this haha"
1,This book sucks,"If you want to know why Bill Gates is a rich geek and the authors of this book are only geeks, go ahead and buy it and try it. The installation instructions are incomplete and confusing. I ended up OVERWRITING AN ENTIRE HARD DRIVE, losing all the information! To subtitle this mess ""Configuration and Installation"" this is nothing short of false advertising. Shame on you guys! I don't know why the Linux and Unix people are unable to explain things clearly. I suspect that's they don't write code much better than they write English, and that's why so much software doesn't work too well. Of course, being lost-in-a-Jolt-Cola-buzz geeks, the author DO recommend that YOU GO OUT AND ASSEMBLE A SYSTEM JUST FOR LINUX! OK for the technoids, but not for the mere mortal. Some other reviewers give this book a 9, so decide for yourself if you want to risk your money. For the .5%, this may be a good book - for the rest of us 99.5% type ""Linux"" in the amazon.com search form and try another book."
3,It was fine,"I never even heard of linux and then I bought this book and it was pretty good in installing. I did hear though that Slackware 3.3 has some security flaws so i downloaded 3.6. I had to do alot of guesswork, so this book is for intermediate to expert computer users. I found many of the applications in both the cd's to be very helpful."
5,Execellent Resource and Tutorial ;),I read this book from cover to cover and am still using it as a guide for building my new linux friendly computer. The depth it goes into on setting up Xfree86 and the touching on shell programming is awesome. The cd's were also a lifesaver and a resource to get software without searching all over the net. Id reccommend this book to any linux newbie.
4,A good book to start for brave heart,"This is the book for those people who want to install a linux into their system. The book dealed only with the installation and configuration, but it's not so comprehensive. More details should be included. The 2CDs contained a pretty good distribution of linux, worth to try it out."
2,HELP!,"This was the first Linux gook I bought. And although I learned some lessons from it, I wouldn't recommend it to the absolute beginner.This book doesn't communicate with the reader well. I had to look back and forth for answers to my questions and only now(8 months later + 2 other linux books bought) begin to realize what I am doing.Slackware is designed for people that are somewhat familiar with Linux/Unix, which most people are not. Knowing that, they should have been very careful in explaining things to users, which they were not.In fairness, most Linux books emphasize what to do after Linux is installed, but the hardest part about Linux is getting past the beginning(install, kernel config, X, installing devices). Most books mention the beginning aspects so far apart that it easily confuses and discourages new users.This book may be okay if you have a companion book on it(Linux for Dummies or TY Linux in 24 Hours), but don't expect overnight success with! ! linux using this book by itself."
1,obfuscatorily multisyllabic confusion,"Sparkly books in general have never interested our daughter more than any other format, and this in no exception. What's special about this book is the long, hard-to-pronounce adjectives for the items to count. Couple that with illustrations that are often too stylized to recognize, and you've got a book that confuses toddlers and bores young children."
5,Donna Parker at Cherrydale,"I read all the Donna Parker books I could find back in the 1970's. They were great!!! I'm hoping to locate copies to give to my daughter now that she is old enough to read. If any parents didn't read these when you were younger, I highly recommend them for girls from 2nd through 5th grade. If you liked Nancy Drew or Dana Girls Mysteries, you would probably like Donna Parker stories too. They were awesome!!!"
4,Professor teaches,"This is an easy to follow, comprehensive tutorial for learning Excel. I have not had a chance to look at the Word portion.Definitely, worth the $19.95 selling price."
3,The Book,"Is not what I expected, even though is not a bad book. I expected something a little more 'fast', but is a kind of slow story. However, like I said before is not a bad book only different to say so. It reminds me Acehebe's work (racism) and is not too long so people can read it in a day or two."
1,Little disappointed,"I was searching for a low density foam roller to help with my IT bands, and hamstrings. When I got the roller, it was very stiff and very hard, like a high density foam roller. I didn't return it, didn't want to have to pay for shipping - twice... so there it sits in the corner of the work out room :( If you want a rock hard roller, this is what you want... but it's way too hard for me and it's more pain than working out the kinks."
3,Foam Roller,Quality was not as good as stated. Better product was purchased from physical terapist for 1/2 the cost. Do no recommend.
5,foam roller and ear pods,I've always been pleased when I order from Amazon I always get my orders in the time they say the Foam roller is working great for I what I use it for and the ear pods sound great.
1,just a rewrite of the manual,"This is probably the worst technical book I have ever read. The author simply covers the commands of the software without any insight. There is a total lack of fluidity between the sections--each one seems to have been written by a different individual who doesn't care what was said before or will be covered later. Lots of boring repetition without purpose and very dry humor. If you still would like to buy one, BUY MINE."
4,Poetry How-to,"It's an unfortunate fact of our educational system that students are often required to write original poetry without ever being taught what poetry is all about. This book is an excellent introduction to the art of reading and writing poems. The author begins by introducing four basic components of poetry: sound, imagery, structure, and meaning. He then devotes a chapter to each of these four elements, using well-chosen examples from poets both famous and not-so-famous. Readers are encouraged to ""talk back"" to the poems by writing original poetry that reflects one or more of the techniques--rhyme scheme, structure, imagery, etc.--demonstrated by the examples in the chapter. A sizable glossary is provided for readers who wish further to enhance their understanding of the poetic devices described in the text. The author states that this book is meant to function as a classroom: It is a classroom well worth visiting."
4,Inspired poem guide,The book was very clear-cut and straight-forward. It helped to focus your attention on the rhythm and music involved in the making of a poem.
3,Better display peice than headware,"I bought this hat hoping to ear it everyday. I wish I had known what to expect.The Marlins logo is just a patch that is glued onto the front of the hat. If you don't sew the patch on yourself, expect the glue to wear out within DAYS.The hat is fairly shallow, and not that large. I do have an abnormally large head... but I would have liked to know that this hat, at best, could fit a 7 3/4."
2,Compared to the first book..,"I'm afraid this book's best attribute was that it put me to sleep quickly every night. My husband and I have reread Patrick Moon's first book Virgile's Vineyard at least 3 times each and so I was hoping for more humour than this one provided - actually, I don't think I chuckled once. It is very interesting to learn all about the workings of a restaurant, about Perrier and Roquefort cheese but this felt more like a reference book than a biography. Perhaps it's because I am comparing it to the first book. I would have liked more talk about the people and their inter-relationships."
5,"Great product, stylish & affordable","One of the best purchases I ever made. We've had tough luck with other hangers but this one is sturdy and affordable, yet stylish and discrete. Hook is large enough to accommodate an extra large or two small bunches of bananas. Fits under my counter (a problem with other hangers) and no problems with it falling over. Would highly recommend!"
5,Sturdy and shiny,"I wanted to get something to hold bananas that was similar to the ""fruit tree"" I use to hold apples and other round-ish fruits. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HAITZS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00This banana stand is made by a different company but it's identical in color and shine and almost identical in height and base size. The biggest difference has to do with the fact that the circle/base actually has a little cut-out that you can't see in the picture unless you know what to look for."
5,"Yes, We have a Banana Holder","I ALWAYS have bananas in the kitchen and this banana holder is the BEST! It was on my wish list way too long! Thanks to my son, it's a permanent part of the kitchen."
5,love it.,"Sturdy and stylish, definitely worth the $15. Gives the kitchen a ""showcase"" look while keeping the banana bruising to a minimum."
2,received broken,it looks cute but the straight part was sticking out of the box i received. my boyfriend will have to either soder or weld it back together. bummed but can't wait to see how it looks when it's finished.
1,DONT BUY online-arrived bent and unusable,arrived bent and unusable. I tried to gently bend it so it would stand upright (and I do mean gently-I only used my hands) and it snapped apart at the welded seam! I saw this at Homegoods for the same price less shipping.
5,Use for my headphones,"I have this at work to hold my headphones when not in use. Great product, but whoever shipped it beat the hell out of the box. Product still in one piece thou!"
4,Ford Motor Co. film,"Lots of good film in this flick, but there is one part that is silent and really has no meaning, no explanation so you know what's going on. There should have been sound on all of it. But... it's still very interesting. Also, the first part about the '49 Ford build end with no real great ending.Bonnie/warren"
5,Vampirism at its best,"If vampires are an erotic breed, this film brings with it a subdued feeling which pricks the skin. Tame by today's standards, this film moves with its own classic life. It may be slow in arriving, but it is a journey worth viewing."
4,Fangless but cool,"Normally I don't go for the vampire film where you don't see the fangs - but in this case the subtly works so well.If you like mood and visuals over plot - and are cool with Jean Rollin type lesbian vampires, then this film is for you. I'd seen it already years ago on VHS and had to own it on DVD!!"
2,"Ehh, it's okay... 2.5 actually","This film is about a newlywed couple who ""honeymoon?"" at a fancy palace like hotel in Europe somewhere, alone, and are seduced by a Countess and her sidekick who show up not too long after the married couple arrive. I normally adore art house flicks, but this one has the pacing of a snail. There are only a few ""shocking"" scenes, and it came long after this viewer had any interest left. I will say this though, over the last 25 minutes of the film the pace quickens and may be considered a ""payoff"", but like I said, I basically lost interest. Don't believe the hype. If you want an interesting ""exploitation"" vampire film from the 70's, check out Warhol's Blood For Dracula. Nuff said."
1,a real snore-fest,"As far as lesbian vampire movies go, this is near the bottom. But most lesbian vampire movies are bad, in my humble opinion. Dracula's daughter was really good, and only one hour, and never boring. Yes it was tame, but creepy and fun.Listen to all of these one star reviews, don't waste your time. Daughter's of Darkness is boring and not erotic at all. No scary parts, no gore, no interesting writing. Andrea Rau is beautiful, but her character is dull. In my opinion, the antagonist needs to be twice as bad as the protagonist is good. This antagonist is boring. The character Stefan is worse than her. Just so you can gauge my taste,I like most of the classic Universal Monsters, as well as Hammer films. I have to admit, I am not a big fan of the Euro-trash movies. Technically this movie is good. The acting is decent, and the photography is good, etc. And that is the only good thing that I can say about this snoozer."
1,Better sleep aid than a book,"Some old movies just don't hold up, this was one. The movie wasn't anything like the liner notes. Not very entertaining, I kept wanting the 3 main characters to either kill something or have sex. Instead they aimlessly floated along in a mystery that wasn't that mysterious."
1,Save yourself! Don't see this hideous film!,"Worse than a merely bad film is a self-important bad film. This monstrosity drips with artsy pretensions, yet is so poorly written, acted and directed that it doesn't even amuse in its badness. By the end of it I felt like a traumatized prisoner.Notes to the director: eerie lighting and bad lighting are two different things. I felt like I needed a flashlight to see what was going on - but then again, maybe the lack of lighting was a small mercy paid us by the director.The screenplay is entirely incoherent, and the actors are absolutely clueless. There's supposed to be some sort of oh-so-erotic lesbian imagery in here, but I've seen better eroticism in the worst European sexploitation films."
2,Hyped,"Painfully slow movie. The countess drinks blood, but didn't see much of vampirism. The background music is mesmerizing. Good direction.Sensual nudism. Full marks for lovely Andrea Rau, companion of the Countess. She is a beauty. On the whole the movie is a hype. Leaves lots to imagination."
5,Daughters of Darkness,Wish I'd known this work earlier. It's just too cool for school! And what a great pity Delphine Seyrig died before enjoying her position as cult heroine!
3,Good story telling by John Karlen,"This DVD, while enjoyable, has its problems, noticeably towards the end in some of the darker scenes where digital pixelization becomes distracting. That aside, the real value of this DVD is that it is the longest released version of this 1971 horror classic AND for the audio commentary supplied by journalist David Del Valle and actor John Karlen. Karlen provides some down-to-earth and often funny comments throughout to Del Valle's serious questions (at times, I almost thought I was watching ""Mystery Science Theater,"" I was laughing so loud). Karlen's quick wit provides a nice contrast to this serious vampire film, reminding us that ""it's only a movie."" Three stars for the film; five stars for John Karlen."
2,Ok,Intersting but typical. Good for those days when you want something that you don't have to be glued to but would like to multi-task.
3,Beautiful but a bit Boring,"Daughters of darkness has what most recent horror flicks lack, georgeous yet creepy environments, unique somewhat complex characters, a slow buildup of tension, but it could simply use a little more action. The climax is disappointing given all the cinematic energy expended earlier in the film. The lesbian theme may have been provacative in 1970 but is very tame today. A must-see for art-house horror fans, but not on my top ten."
3,beautiful beasts,"This poor script story is nicely performed by beautiful actors.Blood-thirsty countess subtly murdered her partner for a new one and both females feasted on a newly-converted-into-same-gender-affair lover's husband.It is unclear who a poor guy was, what they all did for living and many other details but Ostend is memorized."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,this film is really really slow and boring. i cant tell you what happened becasue i kept falling asleep. i wasnt feeling much horror or eroticism or anything just weird borish people and slow boring dialogue. the only darkness i was feeling was the back of my eyelids.
1,This book is inaccurate,Many of the things detailed in this book - particularly with regards to the registry are incorrect! I suggest finding a better book as I have personally grown frustrated with this book myself and am looking for something better. It is simply wrong and out of date.
1,"Bits and Pieces , largely useless .","I've had the book for almost a year . It has been pretty well useless . On some topics , it pitches at the beginner level ; on others it's advanced (but never in adequate detail). It feels 'cobbled together ' . A very poor substitute for a real technical reference . It reads like a collection of introductory chapters to other books ! Far better stuff elsewhere . Here's one sorry shopper . Don't join me on this one please ."
1,I'll Be More Careful Next Time!,"Once again this book fails to deliver when I need it. Having trouble with Windows loading drivers on boot-up, I look up device drivers in the index and find a description of what some ""loadfailed"" messages mean. (Example: ""You can't run Windows without extended memory""). Not a word of advise on what to do next to actually solve the problem.For that reviewer who is disappointed that this book is out of print - I'll sell you my copy. Cheap!"
4,A Great Classic & Free on Marks Site!,"I personaly own this book myself and it was fantastic. Of course Wintendo 98 is a dinosaur today and fading, if not gone already. But save yourself the cash and get it free from Mark Himself on this website, just goto the downloads section.www.minasi.com"
2,Superior technical content that is difficult to follow.,"The author clearly knows his Windows 98; he just can't explain it clearly. This is from page 105: ""The first thing I want you to do is to change your display settings... Now we'll back up the Registry... Our aim here is to delete those settings from the Registry and then restore those settings by restoring the original Registry.""Huh? Will we get back the display we had before or after we changed them? Which settings are ""those settings""? Which is the ""original Registry""?The reader is instructed to complete the above exercise using SCANREG even though he still has the Registry Editor open from following the author's instructions two pages back.This book would have benefitted greatly from a few more rewrites before publication. In its current state, a lot of good information is lost because of poor presentation."
2,"Really cute, but a pain to use","So the tape gun is just as fun in the pictures as in person. It really looks cute and is nice and tiny, which I had expected. I felt like a bit of a dummy trying to load and get the tape out though--it just wasn't working and took awhile for me to get the tape to feed correctly. I don't see why this is really labeled a toy or educational. It wasn't ""fun"" and I didn't feel any smarter after using it."
1,Beware! Very cheaply produced instrument.,"I owned one of these exact Woodland guitars for a very brief period. I returned it, as the neck had dozens of tiny cracks and splits in the fretboard. When a note was bent, the scraping noise from the fretboard was louder than the note being played. It looked, felt and sounded nice enough (decent for rhythm use, anyway). Also, one end piece of the ""moustache"" bridge was unattached upon arrival.On the upside, Lark In The Morning was more than gracious in the return transaction, and I would not hesitate to order from them again. They have a mighty impressive catalog of instruments from all over the world, and are wonderful people to deal with.Spend a little more and get a Gitane, you'll be glad you did."
4,Simple Introduction to Classical Culture,"This is a simple introduction for a small child or older child who's not into history. Written in question and answer format it makes the information accessible, if however, disjointed. There is nothing in here about the ideas of Greece or her military campaigns or why she's important to western civilization. But information on how Greeks drank wine, when they married, etc. gives the child familiarity with Greeks as people. The answer to why Greeks built temples is to provide homes for their gods. If you're looking for a painless introduction to the word ""Greece"", this book is it."
4,Great book but...,It great to keep in touch with timeless ancient wisdom in this convenient way. But I still prefer to read the book in repetitive nature of all old Buddhist translations. Helping us to memorize in a better way.
3,not for the novice..,"purchased this based on online reviews..i majored in english and am new to buddhism and i must admit this is not for the novice..it seems to be a good compilation for someone who for example, would like to sit and read a bible kind of thing..it is not easy reading at all..that isnt bad, but just be warned...it reminds me more of a textbook than a slow, easy, comfortable read like thich nhat hanh..again, just my take..."
5,Excellent Primer,"A lot of Buddhist works (and most other religious works) can tend to be daunting and unpenetrable. But not this work as it is easily accessible to all and translated into easily understandable English.Plus the prologue written by the author has some invaluable information on the Buddha, his life and early Buddhist movement (I found the information on the Pali language very interesting)."
5,Excellent,Anyone looking to read a more unfiltered or interpreted version of Buddhas discourses would find immense interest and benefit from this book. Buddhas words stand the test of time!
4,All Shakespeare should be made like this.,"This fabulous animated version of Shakespeare's play is second only to Orson Welles. Naturally it is freed from the constraints of the stage and real actors, and there is an exciting paciness impossible in more ponderous live action. But it is also freed from the text; rather, it translates Shakespeare's vivid word-painting into actual visuals, releasing the playwright's multi-layered, intricately textured art from a verbosity unlikely to be understood without studying the play beforehand. Visually, the film is a startling mixture of Greek tragedy, dark Gothic and violent hallucination, and there is a satisfying goriness about the murder scenes, with their dripping aftermaths, you just can't get with clever angles and chocolate sauce."
4,Find Your Inner Liebovitz...,"As a lover of photography, I've never gone wrong with this book. Whether you're a beginner who wants to learn the basics, or a serious shutterbug who's in need of the occasional reference, this one has to be in your Library. Best of all, ""The Joy of Photography"" is not a book that demands to be understood on its own terms. It's as thorough, informative and technically detailed as you need it to be, or light enough to jump around to get whatever you want from it. However you may want to use this book, it's a valuable resource."
4,Great Beginner's Reference!,"I disagree with the three people previous to me who reviewed this book. I found it to be a great beginner's reference for compiling, installing and configuring Secure Shell (SSH), as well as learning some of the additional tricks it can do.I have been using SSH for about two years, on AIX and Solaris. I learned a lot from Chapters 8 & 9 about using SSH through firewalls as a sort of ""poor man's"" VPN. The book also spells out the difference between the 1.5 and 2.0 protocols.UNIX System Administrators with little or no knowledge of SSH will find this to be an excellent, step-by-step guide. Experienced users may learn something they didn't know. There are some minor errors, but overall they have no impact on the usefulness of the book.Developers who are looking for tips on modifying, enhancing or otherwise hacking SSH code will not find much here to help them.A book like this is long overdue and I'm glad somebody finally wrote it."
1,It really is THAT bad,"This is rotten book. Anyone who can figure out how to install by following instructions in the INSTALL file, has nothing to learn from this book.I would love to see a book that deals with ssh on the same level API level that Apache and BIND have been dealt with, or even an advanced configuration guide. This book does not even make a nod in the direction of either of those goals."
2,Use as a last resort only,"I bought the book after meeting Ms. Carasik at the RSA conference last March. It is useful as a high level overview, but one cannot trust the details. In some places, the author appears to simply make stuff up. For example, on p118, the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable is correctly defined but is also claimed to be related to the SOCKS network proxy. On p243, it is suggested that the reader use ""something like Perl or a shell script"" to generate the random number needed for setting up X authentication. I had to search the Web to find a one-line perl expression to do this, and then I had to refer to volume 8 of my O'Reilly X set to figure out how X authentication really works. Very disappointing!If I were in the market for a Secure Shell book today, I'd wait for the new one coming from O'Reilly. Use this one only as a last resort and only if you mostly know what you're doing."
2,mediocre book,"Unfortunately, a mediocre book on an important topic.The presentation is confusing. The book's separation of ssh1 and ssh2, although logical, is poorly executed. The text is cut-and-paste in many places. Keeping ""local hosts"" and ""remote hosts"" clear in your mind while reading is a chore.Hopefully the upcoming O'Reilly text will do a better job."
2,I'd have to agree with the Fort Collins review,"A mediocre book for an important topic.I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing it. Ssh is somewhat confusing itself but this title did little to alleviate the confusion. The repetition of SSH1 server, client then SSH2 server, client is a cut-and-paste exercise who's ultimate value appears to be padding the book.I hope the O'Reilly offering is better..."
1,"Confusing, poorly written and edited","Confusing, inconsistent use of terminology throughout. Apparent contradictions from one page to the next. Irrelevant pieces of information inserted as ""keep in mind"" items. Do yourself a favor and buy a different book on the subject."
3,Well built but insufficient battery terminal size.,"The battery input terminals are extremely undersized to carry the maximum 80-100 Ampere battery current specified for full 100 Ampere load.The binding post screw appears to be only a #6 or #8 bolt. I expected at least 1/4"" for the current drawn. Possibly will be usable with ""Real"" battery cables.The wire gauge of cables included is too small to carry the current without excessive voltage drop. The lug on the cable to too large for the small battery post on the inverter, reducing contact area.Due to the input cable/connector voltage drop the unit functions will not provide full voltage at 1000W continuous rated power let alone the 2000W maximum surge specification. Might be OK with heavier input cables. It seems to be very well built mechanically.(See my later post)"
3,It wasn't my kind of book,"I bought this as a remainder in hardcover because I thought the cover was interesting (a strange drawing of a woman seated across a table from a grey humanlike shape), and because it was published by McSweeney's. I found the book poignant, if not neccesarily memorable. It's not the sort of book I normally read, so it's hard for me to judge. It wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't urge anyone else to read it."
2,Bah,"At least it was only 86 pages long. I think most people will like this because they can associate with it. However, having lost a father and being able to know what the author is going through does not a good book make. This is boring and while there are some interesting insights she tries to be too clever, for example the numbering switch in the middle. This book defines smug, she thinks she is better read than the reader and wants to show it off. But it is an arrogant smugness, an undeserved confidence."
1,Should've known better....,"After reading a review in a Columbus Paper, I decided to go read the book,only to find that the review had been more entertaining than the book. The book reads like Dave Eggers on Mountain Dew, who sounds like David Foster Wallace writing about personal things in a postmodern fashion, which robs those said things of any nobility, and crowns them with a commercial vitality.The commercialization of the death of loved ones, and Other Forms of Personal Misery made Public, seem to be staples at McSweeneys Press. I have learned this, and now, for enjoyment I shall run into brick walls instead of buying into the hype."
3,Enough decorative writing!,"Please, oh please, oh please, young postmodern writers of today, stop using gimmicks! Just write! Amy Fusselman shows here that she has an ability to be touching and thoughtful, but apparently she doesn't feel that's enough. It's not that I object to references to the everyday, but the goldfish, the AC/DC, the calling up the ultrasound company schtick, it just seems so tired and overdone. Douglas Coupland was cloying even back with Generation X, and here it's the same thing more than a decade later. McSweeney-type writers seem so nervous about sounding earnest that they thwart their own voices, which might otherwise be strong and affecting. It's like second-rate Don DeLillo. Please, oh please, oh please, just write good stories with strong characters who navigate contemporary society without having to make a Seinfeld-like quip about everything."
3,Poetry in Motion.,"DARK OF THE MOON takes place in the Appalachian Mountains. It is a play about a witch boy named John who falls in love with a beautiful girl named Barbara Allen. John has a conjur woman turn him into a human. The only condition of the spell is that Barbara must remain faithful to John for one full year after they are married. If Barbara is not faithful, then John will turn back into a witch boy.The play is beautifully written and allows actors a wonderful opportunity to use the Appalachian dialect. At times, the words of the characters become poetry in motion. Nevertheless, DARK OF THE MOON is not a very uplifting play. Yes, it deals with prejudice and loss and hypocrisy; but because of the way the play is written these issues have no purpose and give the play no meaning. Therefore, though the play maybe poetry in motion, it has no soul."
5,"""Look at the moon""","It all started in the mountains. John the witch boy climbs up conjur mountain. Tired and out of breath, he beg's conjur man to change him to human. All for the love of of the the mountain gal Barbra Allen. He finally gets what he go's after.Althought there are a few catches. When John come into town durning a dance he finds his Barbra and her date Marvin, the town stud, he desides that he will cut in. Marvin doesn't like that too much, but john still has a little of dark power inside of him... While performing cut from this play, the charater loss all sense of acting and truely became there parts. Judges told us that they could not look away from the stage, to ever write comments down they had to wait untill it was complete. We enjoyed it so much that we'll never forget the love story of John the witch boy and his love for Barbra Allen."
3,Not worth the price?,I could not find this anywhere but here at the time so I got it and had it shipped. After getting it and blowing it up it isn't as big as I would like it to be. With shipping and handling it came to $50.00. NOT worth $50.00! It's a neat idea but not worth the price in my eyes. Found it at Target a week ago...OH WELL.
2,"Fairly ok, but not enough concrete examples","The book is ok, but it doesn't leave you with enough information to sit down and write code with a COM/CORBA bridge. The other poster that said this book is biased to IONA's COMet product is incorrect though - I don't think COMet is even mentioned in the text, which is a shame, since COMet is the most popular COM/CORBA bridge around."
1,doesn't match the topic,I bought the book and read it twice and found it was not what I expected. I easily get lost in the chapters and example. But it did give some useful and helpful data
1,The COMet crashes,"The title of this book should be; ""How to use IONA's COMet."" This book is very vendor specific. From experience, IONA's COM-CORBA bridge is very slow due to all of it's dynamic implementation. This book tells very little about how the different IDL's map to each other."
2,worst Rowan Atkinson yet,"Usually I am a huge Rowan Atkinson/Mr Bean fan. However, this is one of his flops. The only reason this received a two star and not two is there about two areas where one gets a small laugh."
2,Disappointing vular humor,I think Atkinson is best viewed without dialogue. With slapstick we don't get his vulgar juvenile mind. Not worth the money.
2,"So sad... NOT family viewing, at ANY age!","We are B-I-G Mr. Bean fans. We have all of his movies, his entire regular series, and just enjoy his crazy, funny, clean persona. While we understood that this wasn't just his ""Bean"" character, we DIDN'T realize that it was chocked full of simply obscene, most embarrasing bits that focus on subjects that very few fathers would want to watch with their son or daughter present, at ANY age. What a disappointment. I rarely write negative reviews, but felt compelled to do so. I simply couldn't imagine watching it with anyone, and felt shamed watching it even alone. I'm so glad that Mr. Atkinson moved beyond this coarse and vulgar humor."
3,Good comedy but a bit crass,"This is humorous and very imaginative, but not Bean-like in its innocence. This is for mature audiences with very suggestive and crude jestures."
3,Surprising,"It wasn't clear when I bought this that is was bits of two different live events, spliced together; although cunningly well done, making it appear seamless.Still top-notch funny, as always, but I feel it would have been better to have both live shows in their entirety."
5,Contains All the Skits US & UK!,"Some may be wondering, I know I was. This edition contains the US version, which ends with the drum skit which is not in the UK version, But the DVD also contains as Bonus Features the skits that were in the UK version but not on the US. So it's the best of both worlds!I'd seen the US version long ago on television, then managed to aquire a copy of the UK version, not knowing they were different, and I've thought I've been dreaming the drum skit all this time. It's nice to finally have everyting in a nice DVD presentation. This is one of my favorite comedy DVDs."
3,Not as good as the album was,"There used to be a 'Live'Rowan Atkinson album, which I think was recorded in Belfast in the 80s. This was a great, and I bought this video thinking it'd be much of the same material, but only about a third of it made it onto the vid.This has been recorded in front of a US audience, so a lot of the language has been toned down/replaced, so it doesn't have the punch it did in the UK. It does have the school roll sketch, welcome to hell, and the wedding speeches, but they're not as good as the album was."
3,cockatiel food,"a good seed mix but like all mixes, my bird picks out his favorites and leaves the rest--about 75% waste. No fault of the product, just a picky bird."
5,Well worth the money!,"My oldest son started watching Dave videos (starting with There Goes an Airplane) when he was 2 years old and still loves them at 5. I recently bought a firefighter video from another ""non-Dave"" series and after viewing it once I went right online and ordered the Dave Rescue Hero DVD because the other firefighter video was awful.Dave has a charming and entertaining delivery and doesn't come across as ""talking down"" to kids at all like some other people who make kids videos. My boys would probably watch the Dave videos all day every day if I let them. If your kids love planes, helicopters, bulldozers, and firetrucks I guarantee they will love the Dave series!"
2,Cheesy Heroes,"My three-year old grandson loves anything to do with firetrucks and firemen, but he didn't like this DVD. It was ridiculous. The two actors were really cheesy and stupid."
1,Well they're LEDs...,"Most of the reviews were favorable so I bought these pretty confident that I would get what was described. Nope. These are white, non-flickering LEDs. AKA NOT what the item was described as. The base itself is chunky, white, and unattractive. They all worked, but other than that, there is little positive about these. Returning."
2,candle lights,"Four out ot twelve lights did not work. It is too much of a hassle to return the items. I would recommend that if you order these, make sure that you can work with less than twelve in the event that a few do not work."
1,Don't last,"Batteries don't last very long, a few days at most. I've bought similar lights in the past that would stay lit for weeks."
4,"Cute little ""candles.""","You get exactly what they describe. I got these after receiving some flameless wax candles. The bulb inside those is a soft rubber and looks more realistic, which set the bar a bit higher. These bulbs are hard plastic and don't look very realistic BUT they do flicker and if you put them in frosted glass, etc, I don't think anyone will be able to tell :)"
4,Great for the price.,"Candles work well and the price is right. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty."
2,Dissapointed,"I really don't like these candles. Reasons as follows: The color of the LEDs are more yellow and less amber than they should be to look realistic. The flickering is more of a blinking and not at all convincing. The plastic flames are too tall for some holders and look ridiculous. Kind of like those cell towers disguised as trees. (we know it's not a real tree, so why have this gigantic fake looking tree? Same thing here.). One of the candles died after a couple of hours. There are better LED candles out there. The only good thing about these is the price."
2,dont buy those,Don't buy those. The battery life is very short. Maybe a day or two of continuous usage. Not worth the money.
2,Don't get these...new batteries are LR 44 not CR2032!!!,"I bought these and most didn't work with the batteries in them. They are a different size from those they say they use, CR 2032!!! So i have 25 batteries i cannot use now. The actual size is LR44, much smaller in diameter. They work if you clean the batteries in them for most of them anyway...not a bad deal if you work with them and get the right batteries..they flicker nice and have a bright glow with clean batteries."
2,Does NOT have flicker,"Caveat - they were cheap and delivered fast.Other than that, it is a big why bother. Either use a real candle or step up to the larger sized candles with what must be better technology. I tried a pack of these against real candles, larger ones I bought and was very disappointed. I would have paid 2x to get the same flicker that the larger ones have, but after reading all the reviews rolled the dice on these.Beware you will only get a little light LED and nothing close to a flame effect."
5,Amber tea candles,"Purchased these along with color changing tea candles,it really makes a room cozy and relaxing,was well worth the few $$$ and will be buying more,suggested these to friends too as an inexpensive way to low light a room.In closing,a good buy from a good vendor who shipped quickly and was well packaged."
2,NOT CR2032 Battery Lights,"The lights seem fine, but beware, they call for 3 little batteries, not 1 CR2032. Since I already have a bunch of cr2032 batteries on hand I was hoping to use them up. Unfortunately, I'll be returning these and trying to get some that call for cr2032s."
4,Work as advertised.,"It is exactly you see from the picture and description, nothing less nothing more, can't really comment on the quality as only used one out of whole box for a day, but it seems it should long for a few uses."
3,Be careful if you order more than 12.,"Item works great and as described. However, buyer beware. If you order more than one quantity, your order may arrive like ours...two completely different sets of LED tea lights. They functioned similarly, but in appearance, they were in far separate categories. One set had short stubby white wicks, while the other had very tall clear wicks."
2,Nothing Amber About 'em,"These tea lights were placed inside mini red lanterns, and make the red glass appear a bright gold. Not at all what I expected."
4,Nice!,"I used these in lanterns over the holidays! They worked well, and were a fair price. We received them quickly too!"
4,"Used them for my wedding, work great, battery doesn't last too long though","I used these in my wedding. Although they work great (flicker like if they where actual fire). about 2 or 3 of them lost battery charge in less than 3 hours. Not sure how long they where supposed to last, but that seemed a bit short. For the price you can't really complain."
4,Nice touch,We bought these this year to place in our windows and fireplace. They are small and twinkle. They work great for indoor uses but you can't really see them I'm they are in a window. The price is right. No problems this year at Christmas. I can't speak on the longevity of them. I'll try to update next year.
5,Pretty Cool,"The ""flame"" is a bit larger than anticipated, meaning that to make a good display you need a vessel that is tall enough to hide the fact that it isn't real. However, this isn't the fault of the manufacturer so I maintained my five star rating."
5,Cool little candles!,These candles are just fine for the money. They all worked and do have a cool amber color and an interesting flicker.
5,delightfully surpised,"I was not expecting much when I ordered these, or when I took these out of the package, but they work well and are attractive. I bought them for crafts I made with my small children. I could have used real votives, but knew the kids would want to manhandle their Halloween crafts so I bought these instead. I'll use these faux candles for lots of occasions though. They are lovely."
3,Functionally Fine but Bad Light,"These candles are functionally just fine. However I find the quality of the light they produce to be disappointing. Whereas good faux candles are hard to distinguish from real candles (if they are behind an opaque holder), these produce a light that looks fake. It has an ashy, grey quality to it. Also, the height of the flame tips are quite a bit higher than real tealight candles, meaning that they stick out above many of my holders."
3,Needs more flicker,Nonetheless they work good. I use them in my dining room and infinity mirror and they are great!
2,Not too good,These are great if you use in a tall glass but wicks are too tall for regualr tea candle holders so they look goofy
1,Not Amber,"These candles are not amber. They have a vaguely amber glow when you turn them on, but that is the only thing amber about them. The photo is clearly misleading. The candles are bright white and have huge clunky looking ""wicks"". Better looking white battery operated tea lights are readily available for better prices. I picked up several, priced two for $1, at my local grocery store. I'm returning these overpriced things and will never buy anything from Lily's Home again, as I feel their marketing of these was deceptive."
5,They work fine.,This lights arrived promptly and in good condition. They all light up fine. There are no problems. I would recommend these lights
5,Tealight candles,"The tealight candles stay on for a long time, before they burn out. Very satisfied with them. They will come in very handy whenever my power goes out again. I would recommend these to everyone I know."
3,Okay,"I was disappointed that it didn't come ready (with batteries) but it was cheap, so I guess that's why. I haven't even had time to buy the right battery so I prob wot even use them till next year. I don't remember it saying that it didn't come with batteries."
2,It is ok,This book was useful in the aspect that it covered the material in the core test. I found a couple of errors in the review questions which I found distressing. Check more than once source if you are doubting the book.
1,"Errors, Errors, Errors","Being a retired Congregational (UCC) minister the first thing I took a look at, in a Christian bookstore, was Rhodes' account of the people later to be known as the Pilgrims who traveled to these shore on the Mayflower. I was very surprised to read that they were led here by their pastor, John Robinson. In fact, John Robinson stayed behind in Leiden, Holland and died there in 1625. His wife who succeeded him once made plans to travel to America but for reasons unknown canceled them. As the assembly which had met at the ""green gate"" dwindled, she later joined the Dutch Church.John Robinson is rememberd for having said, ""God hath yet more truth to bring forth from His holy word.""Unfortunately, Rhodes doesn't seem as scholarly as others who have written about denominations, such as Mead, Hill and Atwood in the Handbook of Denominations, which is what I reccommend."
2,Too many embarrassing errors and omissions.,"Ron Rhodes does not seem to possess the scholarship and background knowledge needed to produce an accurate guide to the Christian denominations in North America. His accounts of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy are especially poor. A frankly embarrassing level of ignorance leads Rhodes to make numerous historical, theological, and terminological errors of fact. One despairs of an author of a ""complete guide"" who can write concerning the First Vatican Council (1869/70):""More than 800 Roman Catholic priests (sic) from around the world attended."" Forty years ago a Jesuit priest, the late Father John Hardon, S.J., published ""The Protestant Churches of America"", a work of such impartial, objective, and deep scholarship that it was set as a textbook in many Protestant seminaries. So the task is not impossible!"
3,Could have been formatted a little better.,"Good information but maybe too much splitting in the denominations - must have been 40 splits under Baptist....j/k.If he was going to be this detailed, maybe he could have summarized the similarities within, say the Baptists, and given just the differences within.Still, lots of good unbiased details."
3,it's ok..,i skipped many parts of this because every single subdivision of each denomination seemed winded. the main outline's very good and worthwhile.
2,disappointing,"Rhodes describes a huge variety of American denominations. In each case he gives a tiny bit of history, something about beliefs - usually taken from official statements, statistics, and contact information.The book is very useful for those who want to sort out and keep straight the various conservative ""splinter"" groups which have recently been established. It is less useful in describing the larger, older, ""mainline"" denominations which these protest denominations regard as ""liberal."" Despite other reviews to the contrary, I thought the author's conservative bias was pretty evident. He cannot be expected in a very brief description to go into nuances of history, but he makes many factual errors which will be obvious to the well informed and misleading to a casual reader.Anyone interested in the subject will be better served by Mead, Hill, and Atwood's Handbook of Denominations in the United States."
4,Lots of info provided,I really liked this book and felt it provided lots of information about the denominations...from the history to the basic beliefs..he even included the splinter churches that sprang from certain churches and explained why they split. The only thing I did not care for is the fact that he did not include a lot of denominations and sects that I would have enjoyed reading about. Since he writes a lot about christian cults I understand why he chose not to include some groups in the book though.
1,Not Worth Buying - Too Informative,"I find this book written by Ron Rhodes to be filled with many different Christian Denominations and just too much information which is kind of boring. However, it lacks the part where I can see clearly in comparison (have to flip in and out to compare all the different denominations). I lost interest reading it after the first two pages which already summarize most part of this book just that in the later pages it just breaks down what he meant. Basically, I don't really recommend to get this book it isn't worth reading."
2,Err...,"Ok, it's fairly well written and investigates some different thought processes. However, it misrepresents Covenant theology. I myself am dispensational, but the poor explanation and blatant skew of Covenant beliefs (and differing eschatological views) was really disappointing.Good if you want a book to understand Dispensationalism and the following eschatology, but if you're actually looking for ""A Comprehensive Approach,"" look elsewhere."
2,Meh.....,"While this book did have some good information and was very accessible for those unread on this subject, it was LOADED with strawman arguments, and questions for his opposing side that presuppose his own view. Ie. Location 1022, ""Can the Covenant Be Transferred to Someone Else for Fulfillment?""If I were to be looking to learn about end times prophecy, I would surely look for another source than Benware. Like many other's who wrap their entire ministry around a system of secondary theology, he misses the point all together by not pointing the reader to Jesus but to dispensationalism."
5,Patti Page Mercury,"Just beautiful - a unique voice! Patti was a ture musician and a joy to listen to. Expensive, but we wanted the original quality."
4,soldier turns healer,"No Longer Enemies,Not Yet Fiends is the story of Down's dual journeys: as an official for reapproachment between two adversaries;and his own internal journey from hatred and suspicion to a large understanding of commonality of human suffering.In his book the author has more than anyone else,tried to convince himself,as to why a soldier who has lost his arm in war against Vietnam be there to help the same."
2,Disappointed,"After reading an excerpt from ""The Killing Zone"" I really wanted to like this book. In actuality, it was the first book I had read by Mr. Downs. I could not believe that as the book was published in the 90's he is still referring to Asians as Orientals; there were also a number of passages that were potically insensitive. I expected a more savvy account of his experiences and was thoroughly disappointed."
3,Not quite what I wanted,"This is a very nice case that obviously was made exclusviely for the MacBook. I ordered this case to use with another brand of laptop and my 17"" laptop did not fit. The case was wide enough and tall enough but not thick enough to zip around the computer. So keep in mind that even though it says 17"" it does not fit all of them."
4,peaceful,"seems mellow peaceful and contemplative as if he realizes there is pain in the world and wishes to play to you a song that does not forget that people are hurting or that he can find beauty in the world i think that if you like listening to the cars go by at night in a light rain or like to sit by the ocean and listen to the surf with the stars above and the lights of a distant city on the horizon that you might like this, if you are reading this jon, thank you for your work."
5,Haunting,"Haunting, hypnotic, trance music from Jon Hassell. His so-called ""Fourth World"" style melds ritualistic and tribal rhythms with ""jazz"" (for lack of a better word), but not any sort of jazz you might expect. Hassell's heavily processed trumpet drones, wails, and whispers over the atmospheres. Beautiful. Highest recommendation."
3,paper back,"good quality, does the job. readable and was a great price. I dont have anything more to say and its requiring me to"
2,"Quick, Lite Read","This is a little silly story about a man who has a rather humorous betting habit and focuses on the account of some bets he placed with a highly talented jumping-frog that he owned.The story is not half bad and I understand that it became quite popular and was one of the first writings to bring Twain into the limelight. Even so, I do not feel that story - short as it is - stands the test of time as do other writings of Mark Twain. Don't be fooled though, the story is a nice quick and light read, especially if you want to divert your attention from the lull of boredom or any other times of inactivity."
3,my 1 3d bluray,My 1st 3d bluray and I liked it but it was not as many special effects as I was expecting. I really wish I knew more about the special effects before I spent the money. I probably would not have ordered it.
1,LAME AND CORNY AND HUGE WASTE OF $13.00,THIS DVD sucks I know your thinking hey how bad can it be well the only good thing about it is that it is in 3d. The acting in this movie is horrible (like public access bad)a.And there is little to no plot in the movie.
1,One boys dream of flying and finding the girl of his dreams,"I suppose one of the things I have come to expect about 3D movies is they feature effects that take advantage of the 3D effect. This movie does little of that. This is the story of two young kids, a boy and girl. He dreams of flight, she is a natural engineer. Later in life they are best friends but deal with a military pilot trying to steal her heart. The acting is poor. The photography is mostly amazing.Some of the scenes shot over Lake Powell become tedious with endless stalls and boring close-ups of people in the cockpit. There is very little of what is featured in the case/cover photograph. If you're looking for a Blue Angels in 3D type video, this is not for you. If you're looking for non-actors with lots of actor close-ups generally filmed in 3D than this might be the ticket.I would have rather seen a best-of at Oshkosh in 3D instead. I wish I had never purchased this 'movie.'"
1,No G's In This Movie,They chose the wrong title for this movie. Most of the movie is a story about a boy who wants to fly but can't ever get off the ground.
3,For Those Who Love To Fly,"For those who have wanted to fly since childhood this film brings back memories. Yes, it's somewhat corny plot-wise, but the flying is authentic and real. The flying scenes are beautiful. The characters are wholesome and a bit unreal in many ways, but to someone who dislikes Hollywood and such, they were refreshing. Talented? I suspect the script as such didn't allow real talent to come out. This is a documentary. The flying scenes are the big thing in this movie made for iMax theaters, the plot is second fiddle. I wish I could see it on an iMax screen. I say THANKS to the producers and actors for making a film for those of us who wanted so badly to fly as kids. For me, like Zac, the dream has come true.RM"
3,it is on direct tv for free,I made the mistake with wonders of the universe . I bought it and then noticed it is on direct tv's 3d channel for free. This movie is too. I just thought i would warn you.
2,Ultimate Writer's Cramp,"Once again Imax has tried to combine a story with spectacular photography. I would think by know I would have learn my lesson. But you mention the word Imax combine with the Grand Canyon,Lake Powell and aerial photography I took the bait. This story is so simple that it takes away from the film. I feel if you do not have an interesting story to tell why try. Instead of going the educational or thrill route they went with a story that was hard to get through once let alone twice. Why Imax could settle for a plot like this when they are consistently A+ in the photo and sound department is a wonder to me. There standards can be so high on one end and at the bottom of the scale on the other. Imax has produce quite a few good films. But for my money those are films that are educatonal or have thrilling photography. This film has some of the photography but it allso has a story that will put you to sleep."
1,Ultimate Disappointment,"I love flying (have a few ratings). I love 3-d (have lots of 3-d movies). I bought this even though the ratings were low, all I can say is they weren't low enough. (1 star is too much)"
1,Disappointing Quality and Content,"This 3D Blu-ray has the potential to be wonderful, but it falls short. Most of the 3D effect has ghosting throughout most of the video. Its like everything is out of focus. Also, the plot is silly and pointless. Save your money."
