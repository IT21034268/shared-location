5,We wouldn't buy anything but Britax,"This is our second Britax carseat. We started with a Roundabout which we still use in my husband's truck. We upgraded our infant seat in my car (Pontiac Vibe) to the Marathon and it is wonderful. My daughter instantly loved it. We still have her riding backwards at 21pounds, which means we have to be a little careful putting her in only because there isn't a lot of room between the top of the car door frame and the seat but once we got the hang of it putting her in is great. She is very comfortable in the seat and rides well. We have already had to adjust the harness size due to a growth spurt. The adjustment was easy and quick. We would definately encourage others to buy as the whole family likes the seat and Britax safety record is great."
3,Great Seat,"This is a really great seat. I don't think it's outstanding but it is still a very good seat. My daughter doesn't seem to love it any more or less than her other seat. She hates being strapped in but she fits well in it. The only issue is the middle buckle with the belly pad. It's pretty tight in there and I'm wondering if we're going to have a problem when she gets bigger. Also, the straps that come over her lap sit really low and rub on her legs and this girl has fat legs, so they put marks on her if she's just wearing a onsie. So there are two flaws but overall, it's a pretty good seat."
5,Great product,"Excellent product. Fits very secure and is very comfortable for my 16 month old son. I debated buying this as I heard that children are much safer in a rear facing seat for as long as possible, but he was so fussy and it was difficult to drive with him. Now he can see out of the window and rides are much more enjoyable. He has been in this seat for about 3 months now and we love it. It is a difficult seat to take in and out of your car, but that is the only negative thing I can say about this. Definitely worth the $."
5,Just in an accident with it...,"Well, my husband, 21 month old son, and I were just rear ended HARD a few minutes ago....and the seat performed perfectly...not only was my son well protected and cushioned from the impact, but he even seemed a little bored...not a peep. Great seat if you want safety! It's also very comfortable, our son loved it from day one. He's taller than most babies his age, but he's been in it from 12 months old to almost 2 years old now and he's still fitting fine. He's about he size of a three year old though, so it may not last us more than another year or two! It's belt is naturally a little tight, but can be easily loosened, and seems to be fine with our son.What it comes down to, I would recommend this seat to any child who isn't overly picky about seat belts. It's very soft, and comfy and more importantly, it stands up to impact!"
5,Great American Product,"This car seat saved my daughter's life. We were in a horrible head -on collision and the Britax Marathon car seat saved her life. She sustained no injuries, not even a scratch.Now, with a second child, I have purchased a second Britax Marathon because I know this product will deliver safety. I do recommend that if you have doubts about installation to check out the Britax installation on-line videos or make an appointment at you local fire station for proper positioning. The other good thing about this car seat is that it is made in the USA."
2,NOT FOR CHILDREN OVER 40 LBS,"We own two Britax Marathons, one for our daughter and one for our son. I did my research when my daughter was born in 2003, and this was the best car seat. One of the pros to it was that it stated that it could hold a child up to 65 lbs. My daughter is tiny, in the lower percentiles in weight and height, very petite. She is just about 40 lbs now, and is having trouble fitting in the seat, the buckle is too tight in the crotch area. When I phoned Britax, they had no explanation, and no suggestions for getting any more use out of her seat. This has also happened to three other children in her playgroup. If you want the seat to be able to grow with your child past 40 lbs, DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT!! Otherwise it is a good seat for babies, and did make me feel safe."
3,Too big for our car,"This car seat has very high safety ratings, and it fits kids up to 65 lbs. However, I didn't see the detailed product description that Amazon now has online. Pay attention to the info about how much headroom a car needs to accomodate this seat! We had to send it back, because rear-facing, it touched the ceiling of our 1999 Subaru Legacy wagon. I purchased the Britax Roundabout instead, and that fits much better. Also, I'm glad we got the smaller seat because we took the Roundabout on vacation, and it fit great into an airline seat (coach). The Marathon would not have fit."
3,"good, but BIG","This could be considered the Cadillac of car seats. It has all the features you could want - latch system, 5 point harness, can attach without the latch system, adjustable straps for larger children, etc. It's also the size of a Cadillac though. I drive a Toyota Corolla and find it pretty much dominates the back seat. A back seat passenger on either side of the car seat feels cramped by the seat. A passenger in the front side cannot recline their seat more than about 15 degrees before hitting the edge of the Britax. It doesn't block my rear view mirror though (which is obviously crucial), but it is large."
5,Best Car Seat,"Britax car seats are the best on the market. You will pay a little more for them, but the straps do not get twisted or fray as they do with other brands. They are easy to install and will last as long as your child's weight requires they be in the seat."
1,Awful customer service,"I purchased this product from Costco, and after about a year of use, the locking latch that sits between your kid's knees and locks the seat belt in place was not functioning properly, such that the belt would not lock unless you manually forced the latch into the lock position. I called and emailed Britax. They told me on the phone that since the warranty had expired, it was likely that there was nothing that could be done. They never responded to my email. Thank goodness that Costco has an excellent return policy."
2,Poor fit for a BMW 535 (E60),"While all the Britax fanboys are busy congratulating themselves over their beloved Britax seats, I will say that this is a poor fit for some vehicles. This seat is meant to be reclined quite a bit and doesn't fit in my BMW very well. The consequence of its mandatory recline position is that the front edge diggs into the seat cushion. It's not a good fit and not sufficiently adjustable."
5,Wheels!,"We were just at the baby store to choose carseats and the Britax Marathon carseat on display had a Gogo Babyz Travelmate attached to it. It was so easy to maneuver that my 7 year old daughter wheeled her 20 pound baby sister around the aisle for fun. Two large, solid, screw-in knobs attach the Travelmate to a backplate that secures the seat. The whole combination looks very sturdy and relatively easy to use. We bought both the Marathon and Travelmate. We were looking for a better alternative to the Sit 'n Stroll. This may be it. I cannot compare the two options as I have never tried the Sit 'n Stroll, only read the so-so reviews."
1,"Wow, For helots only...","Wow, I mean, WOW...How much of a whacked-out religious nut do you have to be in order to enjoy watching something like this. I can see it now: ""I know you like Naruto and Pokemon - I've got something better!"". What's worse, it teaches kids to be obedient slaves, protesting is evil.Yikes!"
1,Horrible Communist Book,"I read this book and I can tell you that Stalin would be proud! If you are looking for comic relief you might get it from this liberal fossil, but don't read it looking for any relevant information!"
4,great collection of Ivins' columns,"It took Ivins some time to get around to writing another book (as she puts it, now she's an ""arthur""), and I agree that it was too long. She is funny and sincere at the same time. In thirty years, when we try to explain the 1990s to kids who weren't even born then, this book will shed a lot of light.A nice thing about this book is that the columns are divvied up in to topical groupings, which makes it better organized and gives it a better flow. Other than that, it is standard Ivins: bitingly humourous political commentary with a Texan flavour. It says a lot for her that she likes her home state very much, and that it seems to mostly like her. It should: she's a credit to it."
4,old fashioned but fascinating,"Published in 1897, this book is a wealth of information about how book collecting was seen at the end of the Victorian age. Humphreys discusses the very pragmatic issues of how to choose a fine book, how to keep your books in good shape, how to catalog your books, etc. He also includes a few chapters at the end about how famous people, including Napoleon, Boswell and Ruskin, thought about and treated their books. If you can ignore the comments about women (who are not scholars, naturally, and like colorful books...), you can get a lot of historical interest out of this book."
1,Don't buy one....,This shredder was priced at $69 so I thought it would last longer than the less expensive ones I had before. My use is just personal stuff at home. With a one year warranty it died after 14 months. I feel seriously cheated and would not suggest anything Ativa makes as my Ativa router also went bad recently.
3,Lasted for 3 years and then it doesn't shred anymore,This paper shredder lasted for 3 years and now it makes a loud cranking noise and often doesn't shred the paper well.The wheels get jammed and paper gets stuck in the wheels..Will not recommend this product even though the manufacturer claims they offer a 5 year warranty - the shipping alone will cost you more than the cost of a new shredder..
5,The owner of a consignment shop AND a detective!,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Picker Who Perished"" and can't wait for Wendy Sam's next adventure. I sell books on amazon.com, but I won't be selling my specially autographed copy of this one!"
2,Not so great introduction to music theory,"I really wanted to like this book because Dave Stewart really seems like a cool and somewhat remarkable guy. I guess in the end, I wasn't really sure what the book was about. He goes through a smattering of topics, some in more detail than others. The chapter on improvisation and composition left me with virtually no useful information. I think the strongest part of the book is that he introduces the reader to a lot of advanced chord forms and goes into great detail with that. He also shares his love and wonder of music, which has some inspirational value in itself. As a theory, composition or improvisation book, however, this book is far too brief and incomplete to be functionally useful for serious musicians. Sorry Dave, I still think you're a cool and remarkable guy, maybe just not a great music teacher."
5,A rare delight,"The only CD of this group still in stock, it is also one of their very best. Every single one of the 8 tracks is a keeper. Very nostalgic, very melodious, the sound of a bygone, golden era before, as Don Mclean put it, ""the music died""."
1,DONT GET DUPED! (Like I was),"You are forced to use Aether as your service provider no matter how bad their service or terms are. Other providers will let you switch by releasing your PIN number. This is a total sham. Aether is clearly a bad company, not looking out for the user."
2,worthless,"I loved this thing for the first 24 hours. then i found out that the rechargeable battery uncharges is 1 day, even if it is in sleep mode. Other batteries also last about a day. This means, that for this gadget to be of any use whatsoever, other than for sending emails on your way to and from someplace with a charger, you'd better be prepared to feed it batteries constantly. I really regret buying it."
1,Don't buy just yet.......,"I've been using mobile communications for a while and have found RIM makes a great product. But the service offered with the product leaves some to be desired. Specifically, the BellSouth Wireless service that supports the product isn't all that great. From what I've learned, coverage is spotty, unreliable, and not that broad. I have found one network that supports the RIM device that provides great coverage. It's a company called MOTIENT and the service is eLink (it uses the RIM device too). MOTIENT has a larger network (the largest in the country) with better coverage, even in buildings! So, take some advice and check out the competition first before you buy. I did and couldn't be happier with the service offered by Motient. After all, the device is nothing without a network to support it!"
4,"Great, great device","This thing saved my life. I am chronically disorganized (always writing things down on slips of paper and losing them, forgetting appointments, and such). Well, now I have it all in one place and it nags me enough so I can't forget anything! I love these things.The only reason I held back and gave it 4 stars instead of five is because it eats so many batteries I might have to get a second job soon just to keep it supplied. I have to replace the battery every 2 days or so, that seems to be an awful lot.But the other functions more than make up for the battery-eating capacity! Don't let that deter you (plus you can always use the docking cradle and use A/C power when you're not on the go (not really often enough in my life for the docking cradle to be very useful though!)"
4,Supurb Virtuoso,"As a youth I had the wonderful opportunity to play in an orchestra which provided the accompaniment for several of Mr. Mendez's concets. I have never been in such awe of anyone before or since. There are no words to describe the command he has over the trumptet. There never has been anyone who even approaches his expertise and his virtuosity is timeless. The selections on this CD are many of the best he ever recorded and display his incredible ability in every style...every range. If you are not familiar with Mr. Mendez, this CD will make a believer out of you. You will be amazed at what a trumpet is capable of producing. I can't say enough about this incredible man's incredible talent. I don't know of any musician, trumpet or otherwise, who has the complete mastery of his instrument that Mr. Mendez does. NOTE: This recording was remastered and unfortunately, not very well. It is tinny and very ""mono"" sounding. Thus the 4 stars."
5,The Legendary Trumpet Virtuosity of Rafel Mendes,The entire CD showed why he was considered one of the finest trumpeters. Will appreciate other Rafel Mendes recordings.
2,This Butter is melted,"I had hoped to be entertained with this movie and the cast assembled. However, it was a let down and I was just waiting for the end to arrive. Not one of my favorite movies."
2,"Cute, but not award worthy","Cute movie with a unique plot, but far too predictable and often times bland. The little girl makes the movie, though Jennifer Garners acting is superb. Not the best, but definitely not a bad movie. It wasn't worth the Watch While It's In Theaters price though. I would wait until it is cheaper."
4,Funny,Not as funny as I thought based on the preview but worth watching. I would recommend seeing this movie. :-)
5,Great movie!,"Great story, very funny and just the right amount of ""R"" rated humor. I laughed a lot! Great acting! Loved it!"
4,It was funny,"It was an overall good movie, pretty funny. Did have some pretty offensive parts that I thought it could have done without but still a good movie."
1,Couldn't get past the first 15 minutes,"Had I known the premise of this movie, I would not have ordered it. On top of that, it is so boring in the beginning."
1,So disappointing...,I truly like Jennifer Garner and picked this movie because of her. This could be a good movie... but how many times is the F-bomb necessary??? Just nothing to reccommend it ;(( Waste of money.
5,Hilarious & heart-warming.,"I loved watching this movie. A few of the scenes were unnecessary - but the overall movie was hilarious. I could not stop myself from re-playing the scene of the cat basket butter carving. It has a good plot, made better by funny actresses and actors. It ends well and leaves you with a smile."
4,"Wonderful story, unusually told","I expected something decent, and this movie exceeded my expectations. The unusual characters were not ""true to life"" per se, but were built that way deliberately. The movie tells a delicious (ahem) story; the wonderful people, the terrific work of all involved, makes this movie shine. I'm very glad I rented it on a whim. The one and only drawback to this film was the very, very end. They should have left out the last few minutes. The obvious ending was absolutely great. I recommend it highly, with the caveat that it is definitely quirky. If you don't like quirky whatsoever, you won't enjoy this. Even though it's all about butter, it's really about love, and fun, and compromise, and bad choices, and redemption, and all that lovely stuff. Have fun."
5,great movie,I can't wait for this to come out to own. It was funny sweet. I will be purchasing this movie to watch it over and over.
5,Movie as tasty as the dish,"If you like The Mindy Project or Little miss Sunshine, you'll like this. Hot scene between Olivia Wilde and Ashley Greene."
3,Amusing but not great.,"Great cast. Jennifer Garner plays a very convincing neurotic, manipulative, power-hungry wife. Great performance by the 10 year old star. Quirky with some great lines. But overall I found it a bit awkward at times and somewhat unfocused and without soul."
4,"great cast, very funny premise, a genuine family movie, which brought a lot of laughs in my household.","very cute movie, a funny comedy with a heart. Very entertaining! They just do not make family movies like this nowadays! TOO BAD, wooffl"
4,Enjoyable,"I would recommend this movie for anyone that enjoys tongue-in-cheek satire. It could be offensive to some viewers if they do not care for ""irreverance"""
4,"very fun--give it 4 1/2 stars--not for kids, though","I'd rate this 4-4 1/2 stars, because we laughed a LOT! The idea is fun, there's a fantastic cast, and I love the story with the little girl and her sweet foster parents. It's almost too bad that there are such adult situations, because otherwise it would be great for kids, but as it is, I would NOT recommend it for your little ones."
2,eh,"Had so much potential...Ended up seeming unfinished, over-edited and a bit weird (not in the way you'd expect in a movie about butter carving competition)."
3,Not bad,"The acting line up was good, but the story seemed a bit choppy to me. Romantic in the literary since."
2,Butter Review,Too cheesey and silly and I am a huge Jennifer Gardner fan! The first movie of hers that I did NOT like!
3,Butter,"This was a strange and bizarre movie on competition in a small town with ""butter sculptures"" and the only highlight of the entire movie I found was to watch Jennifer Garner portray a character so unlike all of her normal characters. She definitely was not a nice person in this movie."
3,"Quirky, fun","Not great, but definitely fun. Jennifer Garner is really good as the obsessed butter carver, but the little girl as her chief competitor is terrific."
3,Mildly Entertaining,"Was hoping for more twists in the plot, but it was ok. With a great cast, I really was hoping for much more!"
2,Skip it,The story is kind of lame and I lost interest halfway through. The story also does not makes much sense. Skip it!
1,BORING,"The trailer looked really funny, although the movie was long and boring. It never picked up and I would definitely NOT recommend."
4,Nicely absurd,"This is a silly, slightly offbeat comedy that has some charm and some laughs Good enough for a Sat. night escape. For us typical men, the film stars Jennifer Garner, Olivia Wilde and Alicia Silverstone who are all nice to look at and it features Yara Shahidi as an adorable young orphan we can all root for."
1,Rancid Butter,"A sneering tone made this movie unfunny and eventually unwatchable for us. This film should be rated ""B"" (for ""Bludgeon""), because you will be beaten over the head for 90 minutes with uber-liberal tropes that are so raw and cloying you may actually wonder if they were intended as generic satire. For the record, I'm no fan of political views (left OR right) being packaged as entertainment.Warning: This overly-larded turkey will leave a bad taste. A lot less churning and a touch more flavor would have made Butter better."
1,Terrible,"Just awful. Terrible acting, terrible storyline. So un-funny it makes your soul hurt. Avoid this hour and a half of garbage at all costs."
4,"Historical, if nothing else","TRON will always be remembered for its historical significance--the first movie to employ major computer-generated effects--than it ever will for its script or story, both of which don't hold up incredibly to repeated viewings. Luckily, this 2-Disc set recgnizes the historical place of this elecTRONic milestone, including a lot of arcival and documentary footage. The transfer of the film isn't the greatest--I've seen better restorations of older material--but I didn't experience the compression another reviewer was complaining about--my film looked fine, with widescreen bars top and bottom.The film itself feels dated (as does any movie from the 80's prominently featuring a video arcade!), and in the future I'll probably watch it in the same way I'd watch something like Whitman's ""A Trip to the Moon""--as a historical artifact. But scenes like the light-cycle game are still cool ;), and it's still worth putting on the DVD shelf."
2,"Loved TRON, very disappointed with the DVD","I loved the movie Tron but Disney could have done a better job converting it to DVD. A little more attention to detail when cleaning up the film would have been nice. And the lack of extras was disappointing, the trailer was cool to see but it to was in rough shape. So I must give a low rating overall and I strongly disagree with the 4 rating for picture quality."
3,"Tron"" The Original Classic - Olddie but a Goodie","Special Affects were pretty primitive by today's standards, but story line is much better than the new movie. Interesting to see how far we have come with computer animation."
3,Good Movie Could have been better,The quality of this movie needs a vast improvement. I noticed immediately that it needed a Direct Digital Remastering. They could have even added a special edition to highlight the characters of the movie.. I hope Disney will get it right!
4,Fast Service,Got the movie fast then expected and in very good shape. The movie was a little cheesy but had to get it cause my husband never seen it and wanted to before he saw the new one. Worth keeping though because everyone has offered to by it from me.
2,Smeared,"I held off on watching this icon product until my wife would watch it with me since it was before her time. I just placed the disk in (carefully) out of the box into my player and took off. Short story, it skipped repeatedly until I just stopped it and walked off. Turned out the back side was soiled and difficult to clean. I've not tried to watch again."
1,Tron special edition glitch alert,"The Anniversary edition of Tron seems to have many problems beyond mine...When I put the first disc in my DVD, the menu is severely off center. You can hardly see the right hand options. It's a mess.The film itself looks fine and there weren't any placement issues on the second disc.I returned the disc to the retail store where I bought the disc and exchanged it for another copy and discovered the same menu mess.I plan on returning it for my money now and will check Amazon instead of the retail store I chose for future pressings of this Disney essential.Disney's DVD's sure are mixed bag of lousy and fantastic quality..."
5,i feel sorry for whoever payed over 100 dollars for this...!!!,"and yes, when tron legacy came out, freaks who didnt have nor seen the original movie, went ahead and bought the first dvd edition of tron. some payed 80, some over 100 dollars,(the nerd rage was too much). i blame both the sellers and buyers. the sellers for taking advantage of the high demand situation, the buyers for being so stupid and desperate.well look now!! only 2 months away you can buy the newest, restored special ed for less than 20 bucks..this is why waiting is important. sucks to be a nerd doesn't it ????i'l wait my sweet time to get the blu ray copy.. ;)"
1,Disney can be SO stupid sometimes...,"I never saw the original Tron, so you'd think Disney would capitalize on this opportunity to reissue the DVD so people like me, and fans in anticipation of the new release would be able to see it (and any special behind the scenes extras) and actually remember what it was about (and get any references to it in the new film when they see it.).BUT NO...I guess I (and my dd) won't be seeing the film until (maybe) when IT is released on DVD (that is if the original is ever released on DVD, and I then bother to watch it without the incentive of then seeing the sequel on the big screen).Just like Icabod Crane (Mr.Toad) was never released on VHS/DVD until AFTER the Mr. Toad's wild ride was replace with Winnie the Pooh at Walt Disney World.And I was really looking forward to seeing this film...after watching the original.I HAD to rate it a one, since Disney has chosen to not let let me watch it."
5,Tron Classic - Must OWN on Blu-ray!,"This is hands down the BEST restoration/transfer to Blu-ray of an older catalog title that I have seen to date (and I've seen them all...I think). I was not a particular fan of Tron back in the day (child of the 80's, teen actually)when it first came out so I was a little leary of how well it would hold up after all these years. Well, it is simply amazing! The amount of effort put into this disc is worthy af an award in my opinion. I have been into HD since it's inception and have seen almost every note-worthy title in HiDef and WOW, this one blows me away considering it's age. Simply a must-own for sci fi fans and Blu-ray geeks alike. I LOVE IT!!!"
5,If you dont love the Visuals and story love he soundtrack.,This is my freshmn review so here goes. I have seen this masterwork many times over the years it contains so much for all of us it posseses a theme of leadership and how one person can triumph over evil. And the soundtrack by wendy carlos is one of the best i have ever heard. she should be ranked up there with james horner. The best tune she wrote was the ending titles theme. Wendy is such a good writer she uses synthesizers to there fullest potential. I hope you found this helpful
1,Don't bother,"I like geek movies, but this is one bad film. I had forgotten just how awful it is. Essentially an 80s video game that lasts 96 minutes and offers minimal entertainment. (In fact, there was an arcade game based on the movie -- also a dud.) Impressive special effects for the time, but silly plot and dry acting. Almost bad enough to be a cult classic... but not quite.Disney as its nadir.Your time would be better spent in the retro section of an arcade."
1,"Nice Idea, but thats it",I rented this movie because from soem magazine I heard its supposed to be good.Well its not. The Idea of the movie and games in it are pretty good but t slow and dull represented for a human beeing.
4,Tron Movie,"I can't say I liked the movie, but it was bought as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it! I guess it's a guy thang."
4,Great movie that should be seen in its context,"Now this movie seems hokie, but when it was released it was years ahead of its time. Now of course, people have a better understanding of this sort of tech, but all of it was in its infancy when this movie was created... This is of course not to mention that this was the effective birthplace of cinematic CGI, and if nothing else is an important piece of history."
1,Dated but interesting; crude DVD,"The movie is interesting, but spoiled by poor presentation.The DVD was non-anamorphic, which is very disappointing. Usefully a note could be in the specifications like: ""WARNING: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT UP TO THE STANDARDS FOR WHICH REASON YOU PURCHASED A DVD PLAYER. WE RECOMMEND YOU WAIT UNTIL SOMEBODY MAKES A REAL ONE UP"".Obviously I'm exaggerating, but next time I get one of these sub-discs I'll have to return it.Releasing a movie like this one in NTSC non-anamorphic is very unsatisfactory. The number of lines of resolution approaches that of a VCR! Even with PAL, when the recording is not anamorphic, there are still too few lines for a good picture on a large TV."
1,Over $100?! What the...,"Are you kidding? Who drove the prices up? Do you corporate fat cats WANT us to pirate this movie? It's a great shame, because Tron is such a good movie, I hate to one star it!"
1,Ridiclous High Price,"This should not be allowed to have such a high price for a DVD. It is not an original VHS, even though that would be too high also. I hope no one buys this from this company."
3,WTF! No digital remaster?,This is a SciFi move with tons of special effects. It is not worth buying again on Blue Ray until they remaster it. No movie shot on film is worth buying on Blue Ray unless its been remastered. It just doesn't make sense. Throwing in tons of extras isn't goanna make the movie HI DEF. If you already have it on DVD then this version isn't gonna look any better. It just might look worse.
1,Well that was a waste of time...,"This is an awful movie. I'm not saying the visuals aren't impressive, because they are, but the movie is awful. The plot is weak, and it took us like 20 minutes in to figure out what the heck was going on. Don't waste your time. Go see something else."
1,Its still [bad] after all these years...,"I caught a glimpse of this re-issue. Well, if you really liked the original movie you'll love this, but the movie itself was about as briliiant as Disneys ""Black Hole"".It's a laughable attempt to capitalize on the 80's video game craze, and is just about as good as the 70's cb craze movies (breaker breaker good buddy!).To each his own - the DVD is pretty, but it's about as bad as ""sci-fi"" can get. It's a just plain stupid plot. ..."
4,Thanks for the memories,"The summer of 1982 I missed the chance to see Tron on the large screen something I've always regreted. Seeing this film nearly twenty years later on DVD has only increased my regret. Loved all the actors and the concept. Today, video arcades are rare indeed, but back than it was the place to hang out on a Saturday night. Wish we had a Flynn's in our neighborhood!I to wish Disney would re-master this film and release it to celebrate its 20th anniversary...I won't miss it this time!Anybody know what happened to Cindy Morgan?"
4,It all started here.,"Toy Story, A Bugs Life, Antz, Starship Troopers, Small Soldiers etc... they owe it all to this movie for taking the first step. The art of CG animation began with Tron. (well, more or less anyway...) While it's still somewhat pleasing to the eye even today, I feel a little sorry for anyone who is seeing it now for the first time, instead of in 1982, when it was quite literally mindblowing. The fact that I was a 13 yr old hardcore videogame addict at the time enhanced my viewing pleasure, of course. Still, this movie does have a beautiful visual style that has never once been duplicated.Here's a bit of Tron trivia: it was originally planned to be a regular hand-drawn animated feature.Shame on Disney for chincing out on the DVD frills.(Note: This review was written two years before the release of the 20th anniversary edition DVD, which is bursting at the seams with great features.)"
5,Blasts from the past.,"Great movie that changed how computer graphics was done back then. It is a must see movie. If you loved Kingdom Hearts 2 on the Playstation 2 and wanted to know more about Tron which was in the game, you owe yourself to get this DVD."
5,"""TRON"" RULES!","I HEARD IN 2010,THERE'S A SOMEWHAT SEQUEL OR FOLLOW UP TO THIS FILM CALLED ""TRON LEGACY"" I'VE SEEM THE TEASER TRAILER BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK THE SAME! THIS FILM TO ME GROWING UP WATCHING IT IS A GUILTY PLEASURE AND TREASURE FOR ME! IT'S CHEESY,WEIRD,NO POINT TO THE PLOT OF IT,BUT IT'S STILL A VERY COOL SCI-FI ENJOYABLE FILM TO WATCH!"
5,Kids think they have it all,"I saw this movie for the first time in a THEATER back in 1982/83. I then recorded off TV in 1989 and have watched it about 20 times since. I agree, the story is a little hokey at times but you have to look at the whole picture (no pun intended), it was ground breaking and innovative, kinda' like Metropolis was in it's time. I don't have a DVD player (yet) so I ordered the video (brand new) and have watched it a few times. It gets better and better each time. I wish they would revamp it and re-release it again in 2002 for it's 20th anniversary. It sits right next to my other ground breaking videos (Star Wars, Blade Runner, Toy Story). My 7 year old loves it and asks many questions about the ""olden days""..you know...PONG and Lunar Lander.Bottom Line.....GET THIS MOVIE!"
4,Greatest SciFi Title Ever,I had been looking for this movie for a while. I wanted to add this movie to my collection for a long time. It is one of the best Disney live action movies out there for Sci Fi buffs. Watch this before watching Tron Legacy and you will understand Tron Legacy better.
5,TRON Rules,It's impressive how a 20 year old movie explained what's everyday's life in the actual worldDisney's best movie
4,Classic Tron,"I watched this movie to help fill in some of the blanks in the newer Tron: Legacy. Although somewhat hard to follow, still entertaining once you get past the 80's film tech."
2,The memory of Tron is much better than the actual movie,"Tron. The original Sci-Fi fantasy about computer games, and Virtual Reality. A video game designer trying to prove a big time executive stole his big idea, and is sucked into a corporate mainframe where programs are personified counterparts of their writers and ""users"" are subjects of religious faith. This movie set the pace for all future movies of this type. Tron also received Academy Award Nominations including Best Sound, and Best Costume Design. I'll give this credit for being the first of its kind, but watching it recently, I had never remembered the acting being so bad. I recommend this movie only if you want to relish in the history of sci-fi, but otherwise, skip it."
3,"Great Movie, Bad DVD","The movie is one of my favorite of all time. So just by that it gets 5 stars. But the quality of the movie on the DVD was terrible. It looked just like a VCR to me. Let me know disney when your going to ""modernize"" the whole movie. I dont wanna buy a 20 year old movie, that looks 20 years old. I could see hair and spots during most of the flick and to me that is just unacceptable. Nice try but put a little effort into the production value. EOL"
5,It started a career,"I was 15 when I first saw this movie. Then I was just a boy in a small town in Alabama; today I'm a programmer for Cisco Systems in San Jose CA. I can honestly say I owe that to this movie. Seeing something EXCITING that could be done with computers set me on my current Career path. By today's standards it's fairly dated, but then it was ahead of it's time."
3,"Formatting - Beware the ""Widescreen"" caption","This DVD displays the movie in widescreen letterbox format. What everyone fails to mention is this is not an anamorphic format, rather a letterbox format within a standard 4:3 (1.33:1) format. That means for those of you that have purchased high-end video gear you'll get a horrible picture. I am a bit surprised the picture quality is rated at 4 out of 5 by what I thought was a reputable institution.I was pleased with the sound quality.If you do have a high-end system, I recommend you try the 20th anniversary Tron which is listed as anamorphic; I haven't seen it yet.If you're buying this for your kids, have at it, just don't pay [too much]"
4,Tron,"""Tron"", as you aleready may know, stands for ""Trace ON"" a computer instruction used by software developers to ""Debug"" or get rid programming errors."
5,Light Cycles Return,"Disney has finally released this amazing cult classic in a collection that film enthusiasts can enjoy having! The picture and sound quality of the film itself is outstanding - probably the best you'll ever see for this movie - and the colors jump right off of the screen. There are no additional scenes re-incorporated into the film, but there are rough prints of two deleted sequences on the extras disk that comes along with the collection. Don't miss the many special featruettes on how the animation and special effects were done originally - it was a lot more work back in 1982 - and check out all of the animated menus on both dvd disks. There is a single dvd available to the market, but the sound isn't as good and it doesn't have any of the special features. Don't wait until this filk goes ""out of print"" and ""into the vault"" - re-live the light cycle adventure today!"
5,A throw back - but fun,"A throw back movie to be sure, but fun to watch. Takes you back to a different computer age. If looking for a ""classic"", this is not it. The animation is questionable. However, it was the base for lots of computer games that those of us who played at the time, remember well. So fun from a historical view. If on the cutting edge and no memories for you, then not the movie to see."
5,Tron is a classic,"I haven't seen this movie in years. I almost forgot the story. In it's day Tron was ahead of it's time for technology and advanced affects. I have not seen the new one but I will soon. Jeff Bridges best flick in my opinion. If you have not seen the original Tron, may I suggest and recommend it to all. No graphic or bad stuff, and the story is quite interesting."
5,Great Movie,"What an imaginative look into your PC! After you watch it, be sure to get Tron Legacy. It is a great pair of movies."
3,The Classic,"The movie was created in advanced of the computer tech available during that era...It is wonderful and amazing the picture quality, computer graphics, story...Need to have for those who want to know what actually happend after watching the Tron Legacy.Than you will appreciate more of TRON."
4,A Matrix Precursor,"A Sci-Fi Classic, has a lot of elements that come back in later science ficition movies. The Matrix for example, also about a hacker/software engineer breaking into a program. The graphics are 1982, but still look cool and never outdated. That might be the major plus. Also good to see Bridges in a role that he would play a lot more after this."
5,Finally!,"At last, Tron is getting decent treatment in DVD. The previous Tron DVD had no extras on it, which really made no sense considering that a Laser Disc edition was released a few years ago with plenty of goodies on it that they could have just recycled.The ""Edition Details"" ... are misleading. Below is a short list of features in this edition:- Deleted scenes with new intros by the writer/director and visual effects supervisor.- A new 75 minutes documentary called ""The Making of Tron""- Audio commentary- Original soundtrack music deleted from the film- Lots of other items that give insight into the design effort that went into making TronAll in all, two discs worth of stuff. Sounds pretty sweet to me."
4,TRON--A Disney ride into the near future or NOW,"Very complex and futuristic considering when it was made. A little hard to follow in so far as the details are concerned, but all in all a very worthwhile fantasy ride."
3,Reminds me of Good Times! FUN!!,"Tron was a great movie when it came out - it had a great look and since the computers/video game thing was so new, it was just so creative! All in all this isn't a GREAT movie. There's certainly better stories, etc. But late Friday night, when you're feeling a little wacky - TRON is always a great watch. Neat special effects - and it's worth it just to watch the speed cycles scene. Fun! Down with Master Control!!"
3,"For its' time, unparelled special effects, a step up.","Very few films from my youth bring back such memories as Tron does. I was always a Disney fan, although this particular film departed from the norm for them in many ways. Disney has always been about timeless stories, fairy-tells. Tron was a step towards the future, not only in the jaw-dropping special effects, but in the plotline. This was one of the first big movies that dealt with the idea of computers taking over the world and some children's obsession with video games, which has grown even more today. Computers have almost taken over the world. Look around you. Computers are everywhere and have become an integral part of society. Perhaps Tron's vision was not far off. Some of the acting is cheezy. Some of the plot a bit contrivedand predictable, but the special effects and story were groundbreaking. For any die-hard sci-fi fan, this is a great addition to your DVD library."
4,a fine gnostic parable,"Clu is the ""earthly"" (i.e. computer) embodiment of Flynn; Clu is crucified by the MCP Demiurge, and is ""resurrected"" as Flynn; after his baptism in the pure-source-of-power ""water,"" the bit (dove) descends and he first utilizes his User-powers. After teaching the programs love (he kisses Yori, the first kiss in the computer world), he leaves the computer world forever. Awesome!"
3,Too old to be trendy,"That was maybe an interesting film when it came out but now it is obsolete and old-fashioned. The ""plot"" is too complex to be clear apart from the thief who steals the intellectual property, and copyright, of someone else and gets the profit and the fame for a computer game he never produced. Then the attempt to introduce a super controlling software to take over all games is slightly overdramatic and leads to a messy situation in which we hardly recognize the characters, apart from them being red or blue, because of their costumes or uniforms or whatever that hardly let their noses and eyes peep out of the dark grey plastic. The special effects are today very old and lack a lot of elaboration. They are simple and the whole film becomes humdrum after a short while.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"
4,Misdirected review request,"I bought this movie for my dad, so I really can't review it. Ask him what he thinks of it, not me."
3,Why the crazy prices?,"I just bought this DVD for 13 bucks, and when I went back the other new ones were listed at well over $100.00. What gives? I know this is out of print, but is the demand that huge to justify these prices?"
3,Why is the DVD so empty?,"I have absolutely loved this film since I first saw it back in th 80's. I give it 5 stars. The DVD only gets 2 stars though. What is actually on the DVD (the movie basically) is great, but there is SO much more that SHOULD be there!Back 1995 a LaserDisc version of Tron was released that contained full length commentaries, deleted scenes, publicity materials, and lots of behind-the-scenes stuff. Why isn't all of this material on THIS DVD??? There is no good technical reason; DVD's hold more than LaserDisks, and all the hard work of remastering and organizing the material was done when the LaserDisk was produced. At this point very little work is required to get this material into the DVD format.Personally, I'm going to hold out until they put all the material from the LaserDisk version onto DVD."
5,The effects are awesome!,"Watching this movie for the very first time, I was awestruck at the computer effects used in this movie. Did you know that ""Tron"" was the very first motion picture to use constant computer graphics?The sound effects were cool as well - reminds me of ""On The Run"" by Pink Floyd and ""Threshold"" by Steve Miller!If you consider this a ""really old"" Disney movie (""really old"" referring to 60s and 70s movies), then you will be amazed at the effects as well."
4,INTERESTING,"I really like this film, I think I like it more now than when I saw it as a teenager. Anyways, two quick points here. First, is that ""speed-cycle"" scene incredible or what?! Fantastic. Also, how about the bad guys' computer desk that he uses to work with MasterControl? It is STILL one of the most radical computers ever, in history! If I were in control of a large computer company or whatever, my computer would look just like his! Is it just me, or does it remind anyone of the upcoming iPhone? cheers"
3,For those who like Tron,Great cut of a good movie from back in the days. Wile does not hold up to current movies in terms of looks it is still a fun movie for those who remember it and a good cut.
3,Nice to go back and review,It was nice to be able to watch the classic Tron and then watch the sequel. You can really see how far special effects have come just in 20 years.
5,A SUPERB MOVIE!,"This movie, I think, was great! The people who did the computer graphics out did themselves. I bet those same people didn't know that computer graphics is a gold mine. The actors did a good job too! Anyways, the movie was great because of the actors and computer graphics. Disney hit a jackpot when they did TRON!"
4,My nephews love it!,"I disagree with the reviewer who commented that younger gamers wouldn't appreciate this film. My nephews, ages 10 and 12, asked me about Tron after the recent release of Disney's ""Kingdom Hearts 2"", which features levels based on the film. The SciFi Channel recently aired the movie and I recorded it to my DVR for them. They loved it, and when I told them I needed to delete it, they asked me to find it on DVD.There are aspects of the film that are quite dated, but it did help the boys visualize basic concepts of information systems, and was timeless enough to get them to actually appreciate a movie from when I was their age!"
4,Awesome,"When I first saw this movie I was awestruck, I had never really seen anything like it before. Yes, I know that this movie seems incrediblly cheesy now that the special effects technology has improved but hey, I guess that this movie could be called a classic. I think the story line is very clever and interssting. I mean, have a lot of people come up with story lines about computer programs fighting other programs? Which is the reason I give this movie four stars."
2,2 stars is being generous,"This is similar to Mr. Smith's review of this product, but buyer beware. I was under the impression that there was only one version of this book out, but to my surprise there is a real version (i.e. the ones I had found in every bookstore in Madison, TN) and the ""easy-Cheesy"" version (i.e. this product) turns out due to my hasty purchase, this Ray Charles book was meant for ""beginner"" piano players. As soon as I opened the book to reveal what I had hoped would be challenging and beautiful music was quickly thrown out the door when I noticed the large print notes and simple key signatures and rhythms. If you are a first year piano player, then by all means purchase this product, but if you are like me, an avvid pianist who wants to be challenged, then seek out the non-""easy"" version."
1,THIS GAME IS (...),DUDE I LIKE RACING GAMES BUT THIS ONE BLOWS. THE GRAPHICS COULD HAVE BEEN WAY BETTER THEY TOOK NO TIME INTO WHAT THEY WERE DOING THE SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE HEAR FROM OTHER REVIEWS (...) TOO. THEY GET SO REPETATIVE THAT I JUST WANNA SHOOT THE TV. THERE ARN'T ENOUGH MODES IN THE GAME AND THERE ARN'T ENOUGH COOL UNLOCKABLES. THE CONTROLS ARE OK BUT YOU HAVE TO GET GOOD AT THE BREAKING SYSTEM OR YOU ARE (...) FOREVER CAUSE YOU SPIN OUT ALL THE TIME... DUDE IF YOU ARE A NOVICE JUST LOKING FOR A GOOD RACING GAME THEN GO GET PROJECT GOTHEM CAUSE THIS GAME IS NOT FUN AND WILL MAKE YOU SICK AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES... TRUST MEEH THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY BUT IF YOU DON'T BELIVE MEEH THEN JUST RENT IT FIRST AND THEN GO BUT IT IF YOU THINK IT IS WORTH YOUR WHILE.... PEACE OUT
5,15 year old gamer who actually knows what hes talking about,"this game is like GT3A-Spec....but with off-road vehicles.i dont care what anyone says. this game is...awsome. the physics are accurate and the free roam option is great. the missions are challenging and make use of all the extra addons one can add to vehicles. though the collision with other vehicles is rather odd, its a good thing there is no damage or you would be owing a lot of money for running into trees...you cannot drive through the water. yes you can go down hill in the water but not drive. except you can drive through deep water if you buy a snokel kit.this game is great and lots of fun. there is always new challenges to overcome."
2,Quickly Tiresome,"This game lacks some basic features that I think make racing games interesting. Most importantly, there is no damage caused to the vehicles during the course of the race. For a game with above-average graphics, this is a major oversite that takes away from the gameplay.This game did not hold my interest for more than a day or two."
2,"Not a good sequel, Not a good game.","I suppose the great review are from people who just got their XBox and were impressed with it. I'm sure after playing the game awile they reflected on their 5 stars with dismay.No game that freezes for a full second during a race should get 5 stars.You can get $$ in competition, but not if your friends join in.Why on earth only 2 players instead of 4?16 player mode could have been too hard, but surely 4 would have been easy enuf.If anyone has had 4X4 on their computer, they will be dissapointed. I was anticipating more parts than before, and I don't count 9 different types of Winch's as a great improvement. It's a fun and addicting game, but they should have done alot better at making a sequel. I played it for about 6 hours before I got the fever, and reloaded it on my computer to play the best 4X4 I have, The original, it played online too.."
2,Ok,"The games has adequete grafics but not that of stature to Amped or Nascar thunder or Halo(of course not). This game also lack force feed back which is another draw back. The game does contain many levels and upgrades but i still find it lacking X Box standards. If you are into 4x4 racing i dont think you would be statisfied with this game, if your more into the career and mission mode you might like it. This game has the graphics equal to the computor version i found it as a good game but bad graphics. Its your choice it has some pro's and con's, you decide!"
2,"Poor graphics, poor game","Poor sound, poor picture, poor everything. What a waste of time and effort. They could have spent the company's time ad money on something good, or a rushed piece of garbage. They chose the latter. This is nothing we haven't seen before, even the graphics are nothing we haven't seen before. Advanced system with graphics that should be on a PSX.If you find a copy on the street, don't throw it away, you might be able to use it as a coaster for your drink. Don't put it in your X-Box, though. You will have to punish yourself for abusing your system by using it as a garbage disposal."
1,It's too bad that I cannot give it ZERO stars,"This game is the worst that I have played. It seems as if the designers decided to make an XBox game three days before release.Here are the problems. In racing mode the AI is inconsistent, if you get close to a competitor it speeds up, and vice versa. Also, unless you use shortcuts you can never beat the computer head to head. Very frustrating.Part of the career mode is completing missions for money. Now this is a great idea but the missions are pathetic. By the time you complete one you will be bangining your head against the screen. Some missions focus on finding people or things given a shoddy and incomplete map. It is impossible and I don't think that it is even in the code to be able to complete some of these missions.Bottom line: save your money and don't bother even renting this game. It is horrible! If you want a decent off-road game go with Test Drive."
2,This game will make you bang your head on the ground.,In all honesty. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. I bought it thinking that they would have fixed the problems with the first one. But nevertheless I was wrong. Just for the simple fact that the vehicles collision problems ruin the game I would not recommend this game. It could have been a decent game but that problem alon ruins it.
2,What? I can drive through a lake? c'mon,"I hate it because the cops chase me if i go a teensy weensy bit too fast, I can drive through large amounts of water, and the camera angles don't let me see over the humongous hood of my SUV, so i hit the walls every time i get into a tight space. AARGH. The Graphics can't save you now, Gathering."
3,u get what u pay for,this game is ok but u get what u pay for it is ok though if u r getting used to these type of games
2,Are you kidding me?,"Please see volpot's review of this craptastic book. I simply cannot say it better that he did, it is really that bad."
4,"Decent Space Opera, Nice Pace, & Characterization ---SPOILER FREE REVIEW","******SPOILER FREE REVIEW*****I'm a huge fan of Space Operas and feel that The Myriad was a nice ride. He does a good job of capturing that ""military spirit"". Some writers either got it or they don't and R. M. Meluch definitely gots it.The only weird thing is the book feels more like a book #2 though it is a book #1. You are thrusted right into the action and you can tell there is a lot of history with the world, characters, and plot. The author does a good job of bringing you up to speed, but you can't help but feel like you are missing the prior story and setup--- its a minor issue.The book's best feature though is the characterization. Meluch does a great job of giving you 3-d real flesh and blood characters you can bond with.Overall, this was a great read, and I look forward to reading book #2."
3,Space Visitor,"It is sometime in the near future....The nations of Earth have drawn colser together - there is even hope that a new era of cooperation and progress will soon begin.These dreams of lasting peace are shattered by one momentous discover. One of the members of an international team of scientists stationed on the moon has found an alien spacecraft, with all is incredible techology and weaponry intact. The discovery shatters the illusion of peace on Earth, as each nation joins the mad scramble to learn the terrible secrets entombed by alien visitors eons before."
4,Important information,"This book has an excellent analysis of the invasion plans of 1940, and it also covers the motives of both sides, the preparations by Britain to repel or contain the invaders, and a number of amusing anecdotes about what it must have been like living in the Home Counties at the time. If you've ever had the question ""what would have happened if Hitler had struck straight after Dunkirk?"" or ""How would the Germans have been fought in England?"", here is your alternate-history factual base."
5,Messianic dance video,The best Messianic dance video that I've seen. As a beginner I actually was able to learn the dances. The dances have a strong Jewish flavor as well as powerful worship to the Lord. People who are interested in dancing to the Lord will greatly enjoy this.
2,A supposed dance video,"I was disappointed with the dance video ""Dance to be Free"". It has only a small percentage of dance instruction. The bulk of the video is a long drawn out teaching, rather, two teachings by a husband and wife team. Teaching has its place, but if I wanted a teaching video I would have ordered one. I wanted a dance instruction video. The advertisement for the video mentions that there are two teachings, but never did I think that a video to teach dance would be primarily devoted to lengthy teachings. However, the dance instruction mini-bite is very good."
4,Great information,This book has a lot of information in it from some great trainers. Definitely a good one for a beginner.
5,Great Book - very detiled and informative,Told me what I wanted to know in great detail and with great clarity.I liked it so much I bought the follow up level II book.
4,Schutzhund :by Susan Barwig,Good for a beginner.Rules and great descriptions of the sport.Doesnt give any secrets but good basic information to start in the sport
4,Schutzhund,"One of the best book on the sport, it teach the rules and how to pick, train a dog for this competition"
3,"Schutzhund Training, Language Problem","The book could be a great manual for Schutzhundtraining, if there was no language problem. The author uses only the English language for all commands. However it is quite common to train these dogs in German. Most top dogs are imported from Germany and have been trained in German for years. Schutzhund is also a German standard for dog training and has its origin in Germany. So far, at least in LA, I have not seen a Schutzhund that responds to English, all the Schutzhunds, I have seen respond to German only. The author should use German (or at least German and English) for the commands."
4,Super Intro to the Schutzhund World,"I learned so much from this book, so many things, too many to list. There are great tips and training advice to help train your dog correctly for the tracking, obedience and protection. There are nice photos and some diagrams to go by. I recommend this book to any Schutzhund enthusiasts that are beginners like myself. This book introduced Schutzhund methodically."
4,Sensible and practical handbook for novice handlers,"Ideal for handlers who have done some training already, maybe completed the Companion Dog test and now want to go on to Schutzhund training. The photos are a bit glum (black and white) but do show you what you need to see and the text is plainly written and practical. My dog is going for Schutzhund 1 and I am finding the book very useful."
3,schutzhund,"Covers a lot of the history and background to the schutzhund tests. It is good for any one wanting to know what the sport is. This, is a middle of the road book for any one looking for how to train your dog."
3,Hard to read,"This book is a great resource, but not for new or beginning German Shepherd owners. I needed to get the GS for Dummies first."
1,REALLY let down...,"this CD is TRASH. seriously, how can them ruin so many classics? the overediting is so distracting, and so many excellent beats have been replaced with garbage. ""Street Dreams"" has a beautiful beat, but so much is lost on this remix album.buy ""Illmatic"" or ""Lost Tapes"" instead."
2,weak...,"these remixes dont even compare to the original. if you haven't heard the songs from the og version of illmatic yet then you better wake up, 'cuz illmatic is still one of the best hiphop albums to date."
3,Should buy the Albums,This is not terrible they are in fact good remixes the it aint hard to tell remix and the One Love remix were good the best song is the Street Dreams Remix that is better because it has R.Kelly during his prime on it.This is a good remix EP
3,REMIXES?????????,"These are remixes? The only difference between the original songs and the remixes is the beat. The beat is a little different. The lyrics and flow is all the same. I still got to give this album props, though. Most of the songs are from the Illmatic album, like ""One Love remix"" and ""It Ain't Hard To Tell remix."" This album has tight songs. It even has newer songs, like ""One Mic remix."" The bad thing about this album is that that they don't have an explicit version. They only have a clean version. Another dissapointment was that it only has six songs. Overall, this album is pretty good, but not really worth your money. 3.5."
2,cd was ok,The cd was ok. The beats weren't typical nas Sh**. I expected the cd to be much harder. Don't waste your money buying it. Its not worth the 9 dollars
5,Nas on the mic!!!,"This new Nas EP is bangin! Hearing these classic Nas tracks with different beats is slammin. I know some of the tracks are dated, but if your down with the classics Illmatic, It Was Written and Stillmatic you won't be disapointed. The self proclaimed GOD is on point."
1,A terrible remix album!,"Columbia attempts to cash in on the popularity of one of its most popular rappers with this watered-down and uninspired remix EP. This six-track remix album consists of old remix songs that were lying around in the vault for years and Nas himself really didn't have much to do with its release at all.All of the songs have been edited with all explicit content taken out. Aside from the moving ""Street Dreams"" remix with R. Kelly, the tracks are pretty much the same as their album versions except for a new beat. In the case of ""One Mic"" which uses the beat from Biggie's ""Juicy"", it is just awful.If Nas had actually had more of a hand in this ""remix"" album and more tracks were put together, it might have worked. As it is, this EP is absolutely dismal. A much better album came a few months later with Nas' ""The Lost Tapes"" collection. Unless you are a real die-hard fan and absolutely have to have every album he put out, you should avoid this one."
2,Glorified Maxi-single.,"This is a sad excuse for a release. Songs such as ""Street Dreams"" featuring R Kelly were already played to death before this was released, while other remixes have nothing on the original versions. Also, would you pay [money] for a CD single? Because that is, basically, what you get: a glorified maxi-single. Even if the songs were of substance when compared to the original (which they are not), this disc's price would not be justified. As a final note, Nas is a bit of a wuss for deciding to edit Cormega's verse out of ""Affirmative Action"" just because he has beef with him. In my opinion, Cormega's verse was the best one performed in that track.Bottom line(s); If you've heard these songs in their original form, stick with those, because they are better than these remixes."
1,NOT EVEN 30 MINUTES LONG-BUT HARD HITTING BASS,"OUT OF ALL THE CD I HAVE BOUGHT SINCE 2000.THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST.WITH ALL THE HIT'S NAS HAS; HE REALLY CAN ONLY MAKE 6 REMIX'S.THERE IS ONLY AN EDITED VERSION MADE.SO YOU ARE DRIVEING DOWN THE STREET LISTENING TO THE SONGS.AND EVERY 12 SECONDS A SWEAR WORD IS BEING SCRATCHED OUT.AT LEAST HE COULD OF MADE A REAL CLEAN ONE.SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO HEAR A COVERED UP PA VERSION.CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHY THERE IS NOT A PA VERSION MADE.IF PEOPLE LIKE JENNIFER LOPEZ CAN MAKE A FULL REMIX CD.AND SOMEONE LIKE MARIAH CAREY CAN MAKE A 2 DISC ONE.I DON'T THINK NAS EVEN TRYED.BUT AT LEAST THE CD HAS HARD HITTING BASS.BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM IN YOUR CAR THAT IS EVEN WORTHLESS.{NO SYSTEM~NO BASS}IF YOU WANT THE REAL NAS BUY HIS VIDEO COLLECTION DVD!NOW THAT IS THE NAS WE ALL KNOW. HIS DVD IS PERFECTION.SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.AND BUY HIS DVD. (SYRACUSE,NY)"
3,"Cheap, cute board book","I picked this book up on clearance for 50 cents, mainly because my daughter is at the stage where she wants to participate in reading by grabbing at the pages of her books, so board books are a necessity. There's no real story line here; each page begins with ""I want to see"" and finishes the sentence with some funny image, like the Queen of France wearing polka-dotted pants. Of course, all the Muppet Babies chime in on what they want to see. While not destined to be a classic, this is a cute little book that's certainly worth half a buck."
3,"Hardy Boys, Book 33 (The Yellow Feather Mystery)","This item has been bought for my nephew's Christmas gift. I have not read it personally. If you are a fan of the Hardy Boys series, I would recommend this book to you."
4,An Interesting Mystery,"This review concerns the original 1953 edition as well as the revised 1971 edition, which is a shortened version of the original. Greg Woodson, the grandson of the recently deceased owner of Woodson Academy, Mr. Hardy's old school, asks Frank and Joe to locate his grandfather's missing will which would prove that Greg is the rightful heir to the academy. However, a crook, who uses a yellow feather as his symbol is trying to stop them. Frank and Joe must find out who or what the Yellow Feather really is. This mystery reminded me of a Nancy Drew mystery, although, for those that aren't a fan of that series, don't let that discourage you from reading this book because it was actually rather good, despite having only one criminal. The book was well written and had a fair bit of action. I think most Hardy Boys fans would enjoy this one."
4,Mag Float aquarium cleaner,"We had one of these before, a smaller one, and really liked it. It is very convienant and actually fun to use for my son. You just float one side in tank, put the outside one near and they magnetically go together. Occasionally you just ""scrub"" the outer one, moving it back and forth, up and down. Easy! It really cleans the algae and keeps it clean after that. We keep ours there all of the time and use when needed.If I had to get one over again, I would order the small one and not the medium size. It's a little big for our 10 gallon tank but that was my fault as it did list it was for larger tanks.As far as the seller, they were very quick and had no problems at all with anything. I would use them again."
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For,"This monitor worked straight out of the box and has so far adjusted itself to perfectly fit the display of three computers - two desktops running Ubuntu and Slackware Linux respectively, and a laptop running Windows XP. The resolution is better than I had anticipated and the refresh rate keeps up with even fast-paced gaming. No dead pixels. No need to read the instructions. No incompatibilities. No problems. No complaints."
5,Samsung SyncMaster 941BW 19-inch LCD Monitor - Black,excellent 19-inch high resolution for work and play space-I am totally satisfied with your purchase just recommend that you do want to buy large investment
1,Surely a Monitor should last more than 3 years,"Bought my monitor in January 2008. Turned on my computer today and the screen stayed black. Surely a computer monitor should last more than 3 years. What gives, Samsung?"
3,Good middle of the road monitor,"The 941BW satisfies the basic requirements for a monitor. The res is adequate but if you are seeking visual nirvana look for a higher res, the contrast sufficient. Any lower in those 2 categories and it would not be acceptable. I do feel that the monitor had higher cutoff angles than those described in the specifications. Noticeable loss in color brightness and contrast are observed if you move you head more than 30 degrees from perpendicular to the screen. Essentially you need to keep your head directly in front of the screen for optimal viewing comfort.One thing that struck me as a downer was the inability to tilt the screen up or down a few degrees. I see a couple of bolts at the base attachment point but haven't been adventurous enough to attempt to find out if those will adjut the angle or not."
2,Short Life!,"I bought this monitor in December of 2006. It was a great price, a perfect size, and Samsung offered a 3 year warantee. I was quite happy with the quality! In December of 2008 it died. The monitor would power on and off but no picture - black screen of death! I contacted Samsung and had a wonderful experience. They replaced the monitor at no charge. One year later that second monitor did the same thing. It would power on and off but no picture. I contacted Samsung on January 6, 2010 and was told that there was nothing they could do because the warantee had expired on December 31, 2009. Even though I had only had the monitor for one year, the warantee was attached to the original purchase and because it happen to crap out 6 days after the warantee ended I was out of luck. So now I am the proud owner of a non-working monitor and Samsung has been fired! I will never buy another Samsung product again."
4,"WoW, they are like magic.","After one hour of use my 3yr old son sounds like Phil Collins on the drum set I swear. Get these for your childern, if want them to be a famous musician. (J/K) They work and that's good enough for the 1 & 3 year old."
2,This is not an oil pressure sensor! Price is good though~,"This item is a temperature sensor for 1988 to 1992 Chevrolet Camaro with the 5.0 liter engine. However, the price this sensor is being offered at is very good, compared to $26+ at Advanced Auto parts. This item is also GM# 15326386"
3,"dollybea from Denver, CO","Beware P90X is not for the beginner. I suggest anyone wanting to use P90X begin by making sure their body is strong, if you need, see your doctor first. This exercise DVD is not for the weak or sickly.It's a excellent workout, but only for those who can handle the program.I will continue to buy my DVD's from Amazon, but I will start exercise with an easier program, then work up to P90X."
4,An Excellent Read,"This is a book that you can get your teeth into. Plenty of excellent text content, that is enjoyable to read. For instance there is a chapter on micro-propagation, not something many hobbyist will become involved in, but very interesting never the less. There are articles on correct plant labelling and the reallocation of certain plants into different genera and the usual soil preparation, watering and general care requirements needed to keep the plants healthy. There is an excellent article which allows you to work out your own climate conditions, including a map of the different zones. The photographs are of very good quality and the descriptions of the plants themselves are clear and accurate. This book goes further than many of the books on the subject and for those who like something with a bit more meat to it, rather than just pretty pictures, the book is an excellent buy. I am pleased to have it in my collection."
5,Foam is everywhere!,"I bought this book out of curiosity. But I have to tell you that this book is fascinating. If you only considered foam when you had a cup of cappuccino or whipped up some egg white. - Then think again. It is everywhere- it ranges are limitless, as limitless as the universe. So consider foam when you think of beer, bubbles, cells and viruses, in medicine, the earth itself (volcanoes, oceans, etc.), and how about poisons, and lets not forget artificial intelligence and the quantum."
5,I love these! It's a Palm/Handspring killer!,I got a 950 last year and the 957 in April (when it was in beta). After spending $400+ on a Palm V and using it for a few weeks my company put us all on the 950 with the MS Exchange edition so our corporate email system's users were all linked with our pagers. Since then I never used my Palm again.The 957 is a great improvement over the 950. The extra screen space is great. The calendar features much better with a larger screen. And the synch software seems to work better as well. Ever since I got one I've been the envy of the office because they've been hard to find in stock and RIM's US distribution is pretty weak right now. It's good to see they're finally becoming easier to get a hold of now.
5,Rim + WMP = 5 stars!,"I originally bought a RIM Device in order to receive my emails on the go. I know the palm pilots can perform virtually the same functions, but the RIM device is just so much more convenient with its constant connectivity and easier to use, streamlined interface. Recently, I downloaded a piece of software for my RIM called WebMessenger Mobile Platform (WMP). This software has increased the functionality of my RIM 10 fold. The WMP enables RIM users to instant message themselves on WebMessenger&#65533;s network Or on one of the networks on which this messenger is interoperable with( AOL, Yahoo, MSN, and ICQ are the ones I Use).The WMP Is the factor which boosted the RIM up to 5 stars for me( It would have been 4 due to the high price). The best thing about the WMP is that it is free to download and use."
4,Real browsing,"I had a palm VII because I am a reporter and on the road, but returned it because I couldn't get my AOL mail. After several greuling efforts of calling around, I was finally contacted by someone at AOL that I could get my AOL mail if I used GoAmerica. I bought the Blackberry and after a few days of waiting patienly for the service to activate found my way around the unit. I then found out that the service did not include GoAmerica and I had to go to there site and sign up..needless to say when I foundout I would have an extra monthly charge i was upset, but now that I have my AOL mail and I can go to the NY times its worth the extra monthly service charge (10 bucks)."
3,Does it work?,"The author of this book is a vocational consultant and the founder of an employment agency for people with Asperger syndrome, so it does contain lots of practical advice and useful information. It is intended, not for people on the spectrum themselves, but for those who are helping people on the spectrum to find work, such as other employment advisers, teachers, parents, friends etc. However, it does contain things which you still might find useful if trying to find work for yourself, even though you might find it just a little patronising. This book is not about finding a career, it is about simply getting a job. It's strategy for getting people with Asperger syndrome into work is helping them to be what employers want, and it explains what that is clearly and well."
5,This Book Works For a/A Employees!,"For people on the Autism spectrum seeking employment, be sure to make this book your best friend. This much-needed work contains a myriad of practical suggestions and approaches in job-hunting, resume writing and interviews. It also encourages people with autism to recognize that part of themselves with pride and dignity.I really like the way this author addresses the needs of adults on the spectrum. This book is one that many people can identify with and put to good use."
4,realistic help for many,I borrowed this book from the library and had to get my own copy. There was so much helpful advice that was offered in manageable pieces. A sometimes overwhelming situation was presented with real step-by-step solutions to help put an anxious mind at ease.
2,Antietam Detailed,"In this book Frye covers the Antietam campaign, including Harpers Ferry and South Mountain, plus some information on the monumentation and preservation of the battlefield. Those looking for a narrative will be surprised to find the book consists of 1,865 numbered short paragraphs. Some are descriptive, while others merely recite a fact or two: ""The umpteenth Indiana suffered the highest percentage loss at South Mountain."" The over-hyped title, ""As You have Never Seen it Before"" to me implied a lot more than it delivered. Given that, Frye does present a lot of information, thoroughly researched, and the price is quite low. Antietam Revealed is not for those with a casual interest or looking for a ""first book"" on the campaign; it has some value for more serious students."
5,Mad Dash,"Mad Dash is the hottest game around! Racing throgh 8 different levels is so fun. All the levels are long and fun and full of shorcuts, traps, bad guys and more. Its so fun!"
3,"Fun racing, dark courses","The game, Mad Dash Racing is a very good racing game. There were a lot of funny scenes. There were some things that I didn't like. For instance, the characters didn't look right. The courses were very dark."
3,Ehhh...keep looking,"A fun game, but sometimes the game play just isn't there, and it doesn't grab you. Also, too little ability to mess up the other guys. Buy Halo instead. ;)"
2,design mess,"After hearing about this title several months ago I had high expectations for another addition to the already bloated character racing genre. This game has not lived up to the hype. The design of the levels is awkward and stilted, there appears to be little if any continuity with the art direction and the gameplay is simply not fun. If you are expecting Mario Cart type action this is not the game to satisfy that craving on the XBox. I hope that another developer will fill the gap for a good, fast paced cart game, but until then the Xbox will go without."
3,Not a Great Game,I personally own the game thinking it would be good for me. But I realized that it is more of a kids game. I own 11 Xbox games and play almost all of them. I have never played Mad Dash again after the first day I bought it.
5,Stylish Aceliner Stapler,Durable designEasy to refillRubber toe and heal reduces slidingFlip top for validation and clog removalSlide adjust crimp in or crimp out staples.This stapler is a durable tank capable of long term flawless operation. Simplicity is elegant with this stapler's streamline design. Your children will inherit a great stapler after it's years of reliable service.
4,It's all good,"Do you remember that cool song you just heard on that tv commercial? Well, now you don't have to because this CD has the music to go with the product. Some of the commercials may not have made it to the US (Daewoo?)I don't think I ever saw a cool Daewoo commercial. If you're a long time ""electronica"" listener you'll recognize Blue Monday(AmEx), Connected as well as a bunch of Fatboy Slim tracks and mixes. If you're looking for something different, track 1 of CD2 has a song by the Propellerheads ""Dive""(Adidas). It almost makes this CD worth having because I haven't seen this track anywhere else(I could be wrong). Another great track is LionRock ""Rude Boy Rock"" (Sony Mini Disc) the group that did the intro to the movie ""Go"". The 2CD set can be seen as the best commercial around or a great primer to the world of electronica. Even the some of the ""older"" tracks from Lalo Schifrin and Andy williams are classics =)--> e n j o y <--"
1,way too complicated,"You know you're in trouble when the thing refers you to a website for instructions. Just what you want to do when you're tired and stressed about whether your alarm will in fact work.There are instructions on the back, but I think they leave out some important information. I'll wrestle with it again when I have the time and energy, but meanwhile just wanted to plead with the world just to keep things simple, especially when it comes to alarm clocks. The old ones were intuitive without being particularly accurate, the new ones, like this, are accurate but a challenge to operate.Sad. Though I do realize it's all relative..."
5,Outstanding production of the Calvin Translation Society,"This is the second book of Calvin's three part ""Tracts"" of the Christian faith, and are among his most important writings, possibly surpassing the Institutes themselves. The ""Tracts"" are a not well recognized treasure amongst Calvin's writings. The problem with the Institutes is that Calvin was often polemical, and true faith is not essentially this. But anyway, be sure to purchase this, the old CTS mid 19th century binding, as they are still available, reasonable affordable, and beautiful old books. Yet, if one cannot find the CTS, Eerdmans did a reproduction of the three volume set in the mid 20th century, which is acceptable. Additionally, Kessinger's offers a reprint of the second volume (only). But be it known that I consider this volume, the second, the most important of the three."
2,Disappointed with this product,"I bought this for my 3 year old son and was really surprised at the poor quality, especially since its a Peg Perego. Only one of the wheels really spin. Most of the time we have to push to get it going. For the price it falls significantly short. Additionally there is no reverse. We also bought a Fisher Price power wheels truck for my other son (also 3) which was cheaper and was amazed to see it perform much better. Both have the same power, but the Fisher Price one has a reverse function, both rear wheels spin (which they should)!I'm really disappointed with this product."
2,Will not go on Grass,My son was so excited about having a tractor. It is smaller than I thought it would be. My biggest complaint is this tractor can't go on grass. The wheels just spin and spin. My son finds it very frustrating. I would not recommend this product unless you have lots of pavement. Mom of 4
3,For non football fanatics,"NFL FEVER is great for gamers who are not into the real football experience. The graphics are top notch and the game play flows well but may be a little easy for the football fanatic. It fails by comparison to madden, but a better football game for children because the computer opponent is not that hard to beat."
5,Just a Great Game!,I play this game almost every day. It is great. Once you start playing you just can't stop. Once you start a season you just can't stop.
1,Not real!!,"If you want a football game that is as real as possible, than get somethin else like madden or NFL 2k2."
4,Get the 2003,This game seemed expirimental. Like they were just trying the system out which seems reasonable scince its the first game they came out with. I would get the newest one though.
5,This game is amazing!!,The graphics on this game are just amazing. The crowd looks so real and the players act like real NFL players. This is a great game for the xbox and I definetly recomend buying it because it is worth the money!
3,Great graphics/Season(Dynasty) not so great,"The graphics are fantastic. My only disappointment is the limitation they place on the dynasty mode. 5 minute quarters do not truly represent a realistic game. There's nothing indicating the 5 minute quarters on the cover of the box or so far in any of the reviews I've read. If you're into true statistics, this might not be the game for you. But it's beautiful to watch. Madden 2002 pales in comparison to the graphics of NFL Fever 2002."
1,Buy it if you like loads of offense,Don't buy this if you're looking for anything close to realism in a football game. It's nearly impossible to consistently stop the computer opponent's offense. It is also very easy to score on the computer's defense. I just finished a 77-63 game in the dynasty mode with 5 minute quarters. Perhaps this should have been called Arena Football Fever 2002 where these offensive outputs would make sense.
5,Microsoft will deliver,This game is going to pose stiff competition for Madden. It has shown huge improvement since E3. The graphics are astounding. judjing by the latest videos and reviews by IGN it is going to the greatest football title ever. The good people at microsoft will not dissapoint!
1,Nothing but eye candy,"Nothing but eye candy!That about sums it up. It looks nice & sounds nice, but dive a little deeper into this game – it completely lacks any type of realism. Crank it up to All-Pro mode & watch as Quincy Carter completes 30 out-of 30 passes. Shreds your D for 400+ yards in only 5 minute quarters!(...)"
1,this game stinks,this game is the worst football game ever. Sure the graphics are nice but that all i excpected from this system. this game is nothing compared to madden2002 on ps2. Don;t buy this system wait a couple more day for gamecube
2,don't waste your money,"this is my first football game for the xbox and after buying it i regretted it. the game play is poor, passes r too slow, refs call bad calls, all the players look like they r on steriods, and interceptions r the easiest things too get. once in about every 10 plays if no peniltys have been called the ref will automatically call holding on the defence. don't waste ur time and money."
1,not what i expected,"This game was hyped up to be great, but at the E3 tradeshow didn't live up to that hype. The game plays like a lego character, ridged moves, no fluid controls. Also, the graphics that are always shown to show off the game don't appear that good during gameplay. I'm begining to doubt the ""power of the xbox"""
4,Madden finally got it's kummuffins!,"(...)This game defies reality (a football game that is actually fun!). Slick graphics and meticlously detailed character models, NFL Fever starts to slightly take advantage of Xbox's powerful graphical capabilities. Also, even though it does not boast the ""2k2"" name, it has an appealing ""aracadey"" kind of feel but in the good, adrenaline-pumping sort of way. Finally, this game is also extremely easy to pick up and play but may take months to fully master, so when your family is dead and gone this will be an old-school favorite. In conclusion, NFL Fever is a great, solid title with little to no flaws and is a great start for the seris."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This was one of X-box's games that I wanted for Christmas. I went to a store and played this game on their X-box. It had really good graphics! Everything else (was terrible). The animators couldn't figure out how to make people run, they looked amazingly stupid. The gameplay was confuseing and I don't know if you could choose who to pass to, the help menu didn't say. Please, don't waste 50 bucks buying a game that will make you want to kick your TV in! Wait for NFL2K2 to come out if your desparate for a good football game, because it will blow this (...) clear out of the water!"
4,"Great game, but...","a little too easy a little too soon. I did exceptionally well on higher levels, and if you are somewhat good at Madden 2002, you will be great at Fever.Graphics are jaw dropping, and I'm not really regretfully that I bought Fever - but I like the challenges and gameplay that Madden offers."
4,Hope NFL Fever 2003 Be Better,"This is a good football game but where is instant replay and where are the head coach on the side lines, hope that microsoft will correct that for fever 2003. Also let you have more time on the clock for dynasty mode, It is also too easy for teams to Bitz your quarterback most offensive lineman block better then that. Also the game is too fast pace not everyone receiver or running back can out run the defense like I saw in this game there are some quick and fast defenses in football so the AI need some improvement, Also the quarterbacks are the big not all quarterbacks are that big in football. The players faces don't look right some of the players look like monsters. Also fix the pass interference calls it is not call unless the computer tackles you before the ball gets there."
3,"Good Game, but a bunch a glitches","The title says it all, The franchise mode is awesome, but the game has a bunch of glitches to it, the refs are too lienient even if you put it on strict, touchdowns are scored too easilly, and the quarterback throws too many loft passes. If i were you, i'd just stick with madden"
2,"Looks great, but not much fun to play","NFL Fever 2002 is easily the best looking football game on the market. A pity the beauty is only skin deep. Anyone who has played other, more competant football games, will quickly become frustrated with the poor playbook layout, the ridiculously high passing percentages of even the league's worst quarterbacks, and the porous defense. Scores of 70-60 are routine. It's not a bad arcade game, but a pretty lousy simulation of football."
4,fun but not enough to do but looks great,This game is fun for the first mounth you own it.But after that it is kinda lame.Also they need updated rosters every year.But the plus is the graphics.the are so detailed i say one of the best looking games ever!
2,This Game [is bad]!!,"This game has pretty good graphics but the other problems make the game bad. Every pass is an interception and all of the calls are bad. There is always pass interferance and the refs do nothing about it. The game is confusing with the flags and penalties. This game is [bad]. You want a good football game, get NFL 2K2."
2,NO pass defense,"Great graphics; good player control; realistic run offense and defense; NO PASS DEFENSE.If the passing game wasn't just plain silly, I'd rate this game at 4 or even 5 stars...but there's just no way to stop the passing offense. The nickel or dime defense has no effect. Just plain frustrating if you're trying to stop a drive.I'm leaving now to go buy Madden..."
4,Quit Comparing,"There is no comparison to Madden with this one. Graphics excel, loading times are much faster, more realistic play, and you control the game. This game is very easy to pick up and is hard to put down. The only drawback experienced so far is the computer defense is easy to burn with long passes down the lines on most teams. The best part of the game, excluding graphics, is the run plays. There is actually time to see the play develop and holes form without getting nailed behind the line.Great game, highly recommended for the average gamer"
4,All most perfect,"Fever is hands down the best football ever created. Fast game play, great defence, AI, graphics. This game is 5x better than slow boreing madden.But it could be better heres how.1.Use all the pentilties let me challenge a call)2.Better commentary(madden is annoying but he has this beat)3.AI passes way too much.4.Player(you) can pick off passes way to often.5. Again where is the rest of the pentilties!Fever still has madden[beat]. I havent played 2k2 yet so i cant compare them but i cant see it bing any better that fever.OH YEA fever 2003 will have all the pentilties. HIPEEE!"
2,go with madden,"after playing both both madden and nfl fever, i would much rather stick with madden. it is far superior in many aspects, and i would not recommend buying this unless you love football games and already own madden."
1,Madden will always be king,"Here is one simple factor, this game is arcade like in the sense that it's overdone...Madden is precise and accurate in all aspects of the game, while in this game, there is too much, it's overdone...it's simply not as realistic as Madden...granted, Fever does have better graphics and it's faster, but for the better overall football experience, Madden is the safe bet that has been there since the late 80's...this is too much Blitz like and it doesn't serve justice to football...Madden will always be the best...this is just hyped right now like the Dreamcast game that was superhyped and ended up disappearing after everyone went back to Madden and realized how much it was...."
2,Pass on this,"This game isn't as good as the hype. The graphics aren't the best i've seen, nor is it as fun as it should be. If you want a great football game, wait for NFL 2K2. It's the best football game out there, hands down."
3,No Madden,This game is nothing like madden. The game play is to fast and every hit is out of NFL Blitz. If you want to get a game stick with the best: Madden 2002
5,NFL FEVER is the best football game I have ever played!!!!!!,This gaem is amazing. The graphics make you feel like you are watching a real life football game on TV. It's really cool to listen to all of the players talk smack to each other. This game is so much better than Madden. Madden has been making the same game for over a decade. It is getting boring. So the first football game you should buy is NFL FEVER 2002.
4,"Great Game Everyone, Few Flaws","I really wish I had the option to give this game 4.5 stars, because there is no perfect game, but this is very very close. I thought I would never see a game better then the NFL2k games, But i truely love this one. It is a great mix between Madden and NFL2k2. The only complaint I have is it is very difficult to control your DB's on a deep pass. But that's still minimal. Any who, you are going to love this game. Great graphics, realistic movements, stats, and scores, decent commentary, and terrific gameplay. O yeah, Try and get past the annoying rapper in the beginning when you are selecting your team and you'll be set lol.~MIKE"
5,THIS GAME IS DA BOMB,THIS game has the best graphics and not only dat this is like NFLblitz and NFLmadden put together my opinion is that you should buy this game.
4,Excellent...closest to the real thing!,"My relatives were over this weekend and my son was playing the game in the next room....they could see the TV set from the corner of the eye. They thought it was a real football game on TV and were amazed to find out that it was just a GAME! The graphics and the audio (announcements) are very realistic. It's not quite that real from playing distance and I'm only giving it a 4 stars because this is the only football game I own...however, it's still very good."
4,Good football game,"I'm not a sports game person, but this one is fun. Its pretty easy to get going and has plenty of options, plays, etc for the hardened sports gamer. Well worth the money."
5,Better then Madden,"I heard this game was not as good as the popular madden football game but i found this game a lot better. It has better graphics and gameplay, great create a player mode, real trade deals and drafts, addictive dynasty mode, made teams, and much much more. I found myself constantly wanting to play this game and try to form the best team in the NFL. I highly reccommend this game for anyone who likes football."
5,Great Football Game,"I enjoy Madden games, but I liked this one even better. The graphics are outstanding and the play is solid. I really like the running game and the passing is great. If you want to buy a football game for your Xbox, this would be my choice!"
5,Overlooked for too long,"Janis provides wonderful insights into human business and organisational behaviour that have been overlooked for too long in the technological, one-size-fits-all and 'formulamatic' age."
3,Careful analysis,"This book is at the beginning of a tradition of analyzing why people make mistakes in judgement. Rather than canvassing the whole field, Mr. Janis covers one topic in great detail: How group decision making can go awry by means of everyone trying to get along.Mostly, the book constitutes and introductory chapter, in which the topic of groupthink is introduced...and then a pile of case study-type chapters, which examine groupthink as applied. He closes by formalizing the model, and giving a checklist.Honestly...the book is more interesting in whole to historians of politics than it is to business users. As a set of case studies, it is excellent...but as a prescriptive manual, it leaves a lot to be desired. One should instead acquire a summary of the book's points from another book."
3,"So-so, sturdy case","This case came with my Tungsten, and I'm replacing it.Its good points:* It seems sturdy, and closes on all sides to keep dust/dirt out of the ports.* It holds a couple memory cards* The hinges are very flexible, so you can flip the case completely out of the way and sync the Palm while still in the case (unless you're using a cradle).I don't like it because:* Its a nuisance to keep the Palm in the case and remove the stylus.* Nothing else fits in the case with the Palm."
3,DeWalt Dado Insert DW7444,"Well, I was holding off on buying this dado insert until I saw the one with the handy locking knob, as seen in the left photo on the items' page. There was another image showing the plate without the handy knob, and can you guess which one I got? Right- the one I didn't want. It's not a huge deal, I just hate it when they cannot accurately represent the items, and the part numbers are the same. One just happens to be a newer design I suppose. I'll live with it since it is for my portable and little used DeWalt DW744 which is a wonderful saw, and I have used some of the biggest and best in the industry. So just know that you will probably not get the one with the handy locking knob! If you do- let me know so I can really gripe them out."
1,Still not the pictured part,"Well I thought after a year they might have fixed the previously mentioned issue of sending the old plate instead of the one pictured. It is a robust part for sure, but does not have the pictured release mechanism for my saw. Too bad it takes so long to do a simple thing like change the digital picture!"
1,Not what I ordered!,"Come on Amazon! What you are sending is not what is described or pictured. I know I took a chance when ordering based on previous posts, but thought there was enough time that had passed to have fixed your error. This is blatant false advertising and you have been made aware of it before. Enough with the big corporation attitude and start fixing your mistakes and make it right with your customers."
1,Do not buy....,Doesn't even work with my saw (and yes I have DW744) it appears to be designed backwards. If in-fact it is a Dewalt made product they should know better.
3,Dewalt DW7444 Dado Throat Plate,"Although the product received was not the product pictured, it still fits the saw and work well enough. I would have preferred the dado plate shown as it has a functional lock to keep it in position in the saw. The one on the plate received is a joke and if you can engage it, it must be done from the underside of the saw. I've never successfully been able to get it to engage from the topside with screwdriver as intended."
4,dado throat plate,I feel that this really makes the saw complet. i don't see the need with haveing this attachment that you need to have a full size table saw. The Dewalt team have out done them selves with this and the whole saw it self.
3,Nice but not up to par,"Listen to Ray Anthony's Dream Dancing 2 or Miller Moodand you'll see this one doesn't compare. I'm still waitingfor another release that matches the quality of these.I must admit the Christmas album does, but it's seasonal."
5,Splash Cymbal,"Zildjian makes the finest cymbals and this small splash is no exception. While the size amd thickness causes it to decay quickly, it does the job in highlighting the conclusion of a musical selection with just the right pitch and ""splash"". I highly recommend it for that purpose."
2,Usborne Internet-Linked Encyclopedia of World History,"We bought this book to use with the series: The Story of the World by Susan Wise Bauer. It is a great supplemental text that is very easy to read with lots of pictures, however, I was very surprised to find the whole first 1/3 of the book covering evolution! I know that many Christian homeschoolers use this series, so I wanted to get a warning out to those who are considering buying this book."
4,California Homeschooler,"This book lists most significant cultures and events in world history. It has captivating pictures too. There is one thing to note: If you are staunchly opposed to evolution and/or prefer to teach using materials from a young earth christian/religious perspective, this may not be the best book to use as a spine. The first 100 pages are about the theory of evolution. While I am not opposed to references about evolution, 100 pages seemed a bit extreme to me. I personally would have prefered that the book delve into more of our modern history or even have more detailed explanations for major events. At 100 pages, the editors would have had plenty of additional room. Other than that, I would have loved this book as a spine for history. However, If you do not have an issue with this, you will likely enjoy using this book as an overview of world history."
3,Encyclopededia of World History,"I didn't care for the first 100 pages, 1/4th of the book, being dedicated to the theory of evolution and millions and millions of years did this and that. I was thinking the book would be more directed to people, places and things. It is a very clear with simple presentations of the history of the world that can be shown to my grandchildren. However, it has a too much art work, as filler pages, which is typical of the new technology of printing.William Johnson"
2,USBORNE HISTORY,"I heard so many raves about this book, so I bought it for my 10 year old.The information to me was sparse, the printed words in the book are so tiny, I almost pulled out my magnifying glass for my child. The internet links, are links you can find on your own, by typing the subject in google. The price for this paperback book is riduculous. Very disappointed, ended up buying the Kingfisher history book, which I found so much better in reading quality and price, especially since it is a hardback and the Usborne book I bought was a paperback. Check if they have it at the library or school to see if, it is what you want, before you waste your money."
2,"Cheap binding on hardcover, get Kingfisher instead","I bought this book in hardcover about 18 months ago. Two of my daughters used it regularly in their homeschooling for about a year. The front and back covers and spine are now completely detached. We did not handle this book roughly. It is a very large and heavy book which really needed a better binding.The content of the book has been useful. My older child has used it as a guide to find topics to read about in greater depth elsewhere. I had hoped that for the price, all three of my girls could have used the book. This book now serves as inspiration for me to study bookbinding.I bought the Kingfisher History Encyclopedia at the same time. It is a similarly sized book, was used with equal frequency in our home, and its binding is still in very good shape."
4,A Helpful Supplement,"I have found this book to be useful as a supplement to our homeschool history program. The colorful images help us to mentally flesh out the ideas we have read about. I actually haven't used any of the internet links, because as another reviewer said, you can find them with Google. But I like being able to give the book to my children after a history lesson and let them look at the appropriate section. This is especially helpful for my 10-year-old daughter, who is a visual learner."
5,Wow!!! From the very beginning to 2000 AD!!!,"What an AMAZING book! While it was a required portion of our history program for our son, I will never hesitate to purchase a Usborne IL Encyclopedia again! The information is accurate and descriptive and the book in your hand is worth it's weight in gold (and it's heavy!) But when you add the internet extensions, it becomes a priceless connection to history through the ages for children to explore and enjoy. I can see this book being a favorite in our home for many years to come."
1,never received this book,"Never received this book and had to deal with the sender. Very pleased that Amazon stepped in and did a credit when they were not responsible. Wouldnt deal with this book company as they were very belittling when I had to keep getting in touch with them about them sending the wrong book that was ordered. When tried to return it they kept saying that they would cover the cost of the return. But didnt offer anyway to get it to them other than for me to pay for it and make a trip to the post office to send it back. I refused to pay for return and a special trip to the post office as I ordered the book ""online"" especially to avoid a trip out since I have young babies at home. I never did get the book that I ordered and I got a refund. Amazon stepped in and offered to pay for a return of their book and also gave me a $5 bonus. Amazon was great!"
4,homeschooling,This book is fantastic for our homeschooling ventures. I gave it four stars because I wish the text had a little more informtation on some topics. The websites are a great extra. This is almost the only history text we have to use.
1,How Much of a Die-Hard Are You?,"Let's face it. The only people who would even consider buying this are the most die-hard Beach Boys fanatics. An even they will not play it more than a few times. This is near-Muzak, with nothing indicating any connection to the Beach Boys except a few writing credits (Brian's ""Warmth of the Sun,"" Al Jardine's ""Italia""). As for me, I found a used LP of it in Albany some years back (and haven't listened to in over a decade); I'll stick to that."
1,Poor devil,"Brian, out of some kind of sense of family loyalty, must have pulled some strings to get old pop a record deal. How pathetic ... to be a no-talent loser and cruel SOB to boot, insanely jealous of his brilliant son, instead of being delirious with joy over his success."
5,Blown mind at 14,"I was fourteen years of age and on my way to compete in a brass band contest (playing cornet) when someone put a tape on in the car. The opening to 'In The Pocket'. It blew my young mind! It opened up a world of possibilities; it showed me what could be done on the beautiful instrument that is - the trumpet.Hitting all those notes is one thing, but doing it with such purity and apparent effortlessness... Wow!In The Pocket - great rhythm.Zig Zag - jaw achingly good; an inspiration for any aspiring trumpeter.Aries Eyes - simply beautiful.Reflections - very, very cool.Skyrocket- great fusion.Everything's Going To Be Alright - A song that could only have been called this and without the need for words to tell you so.It is my hope that everyone allows themselves the chance to be as inspired by an album as much as I have been inspired by this one.Thank you Allen Vizzutti."
1,IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PRODUCT!!!,"I advise you NOT to buy this CD for $99.99.It is NOT as rare as mentioned above. Although I had a VERY difficult time tracking this CD through other stores (both public and online), I found the CD in high stock at http://www.varesesarabande.com. And.... this CD only costs 16.98! That's it! Not a friggin 100 bucks!When searching, be sure you enter ""Recruit"" and not ""The Recruit,"" otherwise the search will yield no results. In case you're wondering, I am not a representative of Varese Sarabande records. Rather, I am a conscientious consumer and hate to see anyone get ripped off.I implore you to post a comment if my consumer advisory review was helpful to you. And let's see if the above-seller ends up reducing his price hahahahaha."
4,"4 Months Into 2003, And This Is The First Score Worth Buying","I Am A Huge Fan Of Movie Scores. In Fact, They Are Practically The Only Music I Listen To. The score to the exciting film The Recruit by Klaus Badelt instantly caught my ear when I viewed the film. I instantly went out and bought the cd, and I haven't stopped listening to it since. It is fast, fun, and exciting, and it mixes synths along with a symphony orchestra. Imagine taking the movie score to an epic film (a la John Williams) and mixing it with tecnho. The score to The Recruit is what you would get. It is now 4 months into 2003, and this is the only score from this year I have bought, and to be honest, I am glad I did. It is well worth your time and money, and for all fans of movie scores, or for those who like techno-esque/symphony music, this is for you."
4,Badelt's going on synths,"It's not bad. Maybe too simle in some ways, but it's tasty, precise. Piano in combination with synth rhythms goes well. When I saw the movie, first my attention was on the score, because it was unusual for me. Good, not the best. Badelt's best still is Time Machine."
5,Very enjoyable insight into director John Ford's stock company!,"Very well-written autobiography of long-time and highly respected actor Harry Carey,Jr. It is written in a style that makes the reader feel as if Carey is telling you the stories of working with John Ford, John Wayne, and countless others ( such as stuntmen, horse wranglers, assistant directors) in your living room. So interesting and informative, it is hard to put down. Simply enjoyable, entertaining, and very educational for would-be western film buffs, baby-boomers and others who loved the golden age of westerns."
1,worst wrestling game ever,"They dont seem to be able to make any decent wrestling games for X Box and this game is a prime example. The players move so slowly it has to be one of the most boring game available. The same goes for other wrestling games on XBox, like legends of wrestling. It is a real shame because I am a wrestling fan and would like a decent game, but none of the XBOX games can even compare to the games I got on my playstation 1."
1,THIS GAME [IS BAD]!!!!!!,"ONLY BUY THIS GAME IF YOUR A DIE HARD WRESTLING FAN AND IF YOU REALLY WANT A WRESTLING GAME FOR XBOX. OTHERWISE THIS GAME [IS BAD]. ANCHOR REALLY SCREWED THIS GAME UP. THEY TOOK OUT EVERYTHING GOOD ABOUT THE GAME. THEY TOOK OUT THE BLOOD, THEY TOOK OUT THE ABILITY TO GO BACK STAGE AND FIGHT IN THE CROWD. THERE ARN'T THAT MANY MATCHES TO CHOOSE FROM. IF YOUR GOING FOR A SPECIFIC TITLE IN THE GAME YOU CANNOT SAVE IN BETWEEN MATCHES. YOU'LL HAVE TO WIN THE TITLE THROUGH ONE SITTING. DON'T GET ME WRONG THIS IS A DECENT GAME, BUT I AM REALLY DISSAPPOINTED. I SUGGEST YOU RENT THIS GAME BEFORE BUYING IT."
2,Not for Single Players,"One word, Disappointment! After all the hype and the rumors and this is what we get. There is no Story mode to speak of. Win all five belts and you unlock four characters, of which none are particularly interesting. Single player gets old after about a half hour. The Crowd-Please-O'meter takes a lot of getting used to before you can pull of a special regularly. Other than being able to attack your opponent during the intro, the game lacks all of the goodies we were expecting.All in all the game is only worthwhile in multiplayer, and then only if your friends have had practice with the game controls and working the meter. But when you do have a good group together, whacking someone over the head with a ladder or table can be quite fulfilling.If you don't really do multiplayer or don't like wrestling...steer clear."
1,terrible,"the worst wrestling game I've ever played. The WWF game on N64 is 5 times better than this. Dont't buy it, don't rent it, don't even look at it, it's that bad."
2,A major letdown!!!!!,"This game is not what I thought it would be at all. After really enjoying No Mercy for N64 I thought for sure THQ would do justice to Raw on the XBox...Well the didn't! Sure the grahpics are great but that's it! No story mode, no blood, no tag belts, no cage matches, not tlc matches, no Hell in a Cell matches, no backstage areas, no fighting in the crowd, no ECW\WCW wrestlers like RVD or Booker T and only 16 slots to create your own superstar?? And it's more of a sim than an arcade game which is not a bad thing, just don't think Spike can beat UT and you'll be okay. What was the developer thinking? This game is a poor rushed version of what could have been the greatest wrestling game up to this point. What a joke. I was looking forward to this game on XBox but now I'm glad I didn't buy it. Well at least the multiplayer can be fun. Talk about dropping the ball! Well I can still look forward to UFC."
5,THIS IS THE BEST WRESTLING GAME EVER!!!!!!,Everyday I Watch the screens and clips of this game and I can't wait to play it!! The GRAPHICS is so GOOD and there are many options. I've read all of the reviews and most of the people are right that this ROCKS. I'm gonna buy XBOX next month and the first game I buy will be RAW IS WAR. ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO READ THIS ... YOU HAVE TO GET XBOX AND DEFINATELY this GAME.
5,The first realistic wrestling game,"Unlike the button mashers of past, this wrestling game holds promise to be the most realistic wrestling game to date. It was developed by the same team who developed Ultimate Fighting Championship, which was hailed as the most realistic video game fighter created. So now you can have excellent graphics, your favorite WWF stars, and most importantly strategy instead of button mashing. A must for WWF fans."
2,WWE RAW is a HUGE letdown,"This game is nothing like they said it would be.they said superstars would bleed,they don't.you were souposed to be able to fight in the crowd,you can't.You can't even go Bckstage.It's not have as good as smackdown[3]at all.There's no Hell in a cell,no first blood,no tlc,notable,no guest referes,noladder,no royal rumble,no I quit macths..."
1,"Forget HHH, DON'T Play The Game...","Yeah, it's pretty safe to say that this is the worst wrestling game ever made. The only good thing was the graphics. Royal Rumble on the Dreamcast was better than this display of cow ..., that's why I say the XBOX [stinks].... DOWN WITH THQ! You want real wrestling? I suggest you hang on tight for the Backyard Wrestling game cuz that's the only way you'll get the EXTREME! ..."
1,doesnt touch smack down just bring it,the graphics in this game are un real. The creat a player is as good as can be. But the games is incredibly boaring. Moving your character is very unusual. It is also very hard to do your players signature move. You have to have the crowd on your side (almost imposible) then you have to stun im (very hard) then he has to be in the perfect position (one in a million) then push a and b at the same time. This game has a few good side trates but the game itself is horible
1,Is this good or BAD !!!,WWF Raw is such a [bad] game the wrestler don't even look like them only some dp look a like but Smack Down Just Bring It is so much beter then this I would rent it not buy it or I might not even rent it because it is so poor !!!
2,This Game Should Of Came Out A Long Time Ago. Fareals,"This Game Gets A Low Review. Common Now I Know Some Of Y'all Agree Wit Me. First Of All The Only Good Thing I Like About The Game Is The Entrances And Graphics. Now Here Comes The Bad Part. When Did This Game Come Out? A Couple Of Weeks Ago. Now Who Do They Have In This Game? All The Wrestlers Before The Invasion. This Game Is A Year Behind In Wrestlers. Why Pick People Like K-Kwik, Taka & Funaki When They Could Of Designated Them For People Like RVD & nWo. I Hope When THQ Comes Out With WrestleMania X8 On The GameCube Its Updated. Very Dissapointing Game For The X-Box. I Prob Would Of Liked This Game Alot Better If It Came Out During The Time When The Wrestlers In The Game Were Still Around And Updated. I'll Stick to Wrestlemania 2000 For The N64 Till Wrestlemania X8 Comes Out On GameCube. One Mo Gin Fa Tha BloCK."
1,...,"Yeah, the graphics and the sound for the most of this game are good, but the overall quality of this game is just awful. The gameplay is shameful, and even some of this wrestlers especially the most popular one: Triple H, look disgraceful...."
1,"Don't buy this game,RENT First!!!!!","This game is one of the biggest dissapointments Xbox has to offer. There are no cage matches, You could only get the Raw arena, The simulation style of gameplay is horrible it takes about an hour to win a match in easy mode. You can't save your progress in championship mode unless you win all the matches. The only thing that's good in this game are the graphichs. My suggestion is to rent this game, belive me you'll thank me for it, but you're probably off better waiting for 'Legends of Wrestling' to come out."
1,WWF: Raw is War,"WWF games have all [been bad] since THQ started making them. The Playstion version of ""Raw is War"" by Acclaim is 10 times better than this sorry excuse for a wrestling game. The only thing this game has going for it is the graphics. The play and control of the charaters is sub-standard.My advice, save your money and spend it on Max Payne instead."
1,One of the most overhyped games of all-time!!!,"Graphics look nice but are severly flawed when it comes down to realistic modeling! Grapple engine shows promise, but the overall gameplay stinks big time! More than half the hype never materialized into the final product. Put it like this... I share the same sentiments and gripes that most the reviewers who have criticized this game have! I was really looking forward to this title, but I feel personally that graphics aside... It's garbage! By all means, if you must check out this title, RENT IT FIRST! And YES I'm a huge wrestling game fan!"
3,rent before buying,"OH, I'VE BEEN A FAN OF THE WWF FOR COUNTLESS YEARS AND A FAN OF THE VIDEO GAMES AS WELL, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE WEAKER TITLES FROM THE WWF. WHEN THE GAME OPENS IT IS SUPER REALISTIC AND FOLLOWS THE SHOW PERFECTLY, BUT AFTER ALL THE FANTASTIC ENTRANCES AND PYRO IS OVER, WELL THAT WHERE THE TROUBLE STARTS:1. BORING GAME MODES2. NO REF3. ALL THE COMPUTER WRESTLERS MAINLY KICK AND PUNCH4. THE BELT MODE SUCKS BECAUSE NO SAVE FEATUREI DO LIKE THE SLOW MO SEQUENCES AND I LIKE THE GRAPHICS AND SOME OF THE GAMEPLAY IS FUN, BUT IT SEEMS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL HIT YOUR FINISHER AND PIN BUT HE WILL ALWAYS KICK OUT, HOWEVER THEY WILL PUNCH YOU A COUPLE OF TIMES AND THEY WIN .I WISH I WOULD'VE RENTED IT EFORE BUYING."
1,Raw is...garbage?,"Okay, so I load up WWF Raw for the X-Box and I'm thinking ""This looks pretty good!""""I said it looks great!""""I said the graphics are awesome!""What?""So I begin playing the game and I make a new character.""""And I go on and win a belt.""""The matches take forever because opponents get up from your finisher.""""Then they roll you over and pin you.""WHAT?""So I tried something different.""""I played a Hardcore match and hit Jeff Hardy with a chair.""""And I hit him again.""""And again.""""And I broke the chair on the tenth chair shot.""""Then I picked up the broken chair and hit him with that.""What?""I hit him a dozen times with the broken chair.""What?""Then Jeff Hardy got up and kicked me once and pinned me.""WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?And just think...you can unlock the talentless Fred Durst by winning the Heavyweight Title. WHAT?This game is UNFINISHED. It lacks game modes. It lacks balance. It moves VERY slow. The wrestlers walk like they're constipated.Do not touch this one."
2,Way Overhyped....,"This game has definitely been overhyped. I've played THQ's PS2 Smackdown: Just Bring It and I can't believe the same company has put these two games out. The gameplay is extremely hard. I have won one match so far on Eacy setting. The players reverse every move you make. No story line, next to impossible finishers, and...[bad] selection matches make this A BIG BUST!!!The only positive thing about this game is that it is the only wrestling game on XBOX right now. I DEFINTIELY REGRET...[PURCHASING THIS] !!!! I like my XBOX but I have to admit that Smackdown 3: Just Bring it is light years ahead of this one!!!"
5,THE BEST GAME EVER,I AM VERY SURE THAT X BOX IS BETTER THAN PS2. IN WWF RAW IS WAR FOR X BOX IS THE BEST WHEN THE PEOPLE BLEED THE BLOOD GEOS ALL OVER THE WRESTLING MAT. THE PEOPLE ARE SO LIFE LIKE AND WHEN THE UNDERTAKER COMES OUT THE WEELS MOVE NOT LIKE JBI ON PS2. YOU FIGHT IN THE CROWD AND YOU GET TO GO BACK STAGE.AND YOU HAVE TO EARN 10 PEOPLE AND THERE ARE OVER 35 PEOPLE. THIS REVIEW IS FROM OSHER.K
2,very disappointing,"I bought the game based on the the really high reviews. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. The N64 wrestling game was much, MUCH better. Definitely rent it before you buy."
4,"RAW IS GOOD, SMACKDOWN JBI IS BETTER","I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I FIRST PLAYED THIS GAME, THE GRAPHICS ARE THE BEST ON ANY WRESTLING GAME I'VE SEEN.BUT ONCE I LEARNED THE CONTROLS IT REALLY ISN'T A BAD GAME.ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT IF SMACKDOWN HAD THE GRAPHICS THAT RAW HAS IT WOULD BE THE BEST WRESTLING GAME PS2 WOULD RULE.I HAVE BOTH SYSTEMS I LOVE THEM BOTH,THIS IS THE FIRST OF EVERYTHING FOR THE XBOX, JUST LIKE PS2 THEY'VE MADE TERRIBLE GAMES.I THINK FUTURE GAMES FOR THE XBOX WILL BE QUALITY GAMES WITH ALOT OF REPLAY VALUE."
3,WWF Raw is WHAT!!!,"Well, I'm big into wrestling games and some of you may notice I owe a trunk load of wrestling video games...I had actually ordered this one 3 months in advance and then cancelled the order 2 days before it was going to be shipped and went and bought it. I just couldn't wait through all of the shipping and etcra. The way I percieve the game.1)The wrestlers all walk like they need to use the bathroom2)It is nearly impossible to do a finishing manuever3)It lacks the variety of matches that SD3:JBI had.4)It does have a longer championship mode5)RVD is on the game (You must unlock him)6)The entrances are good, but could still use a little tweaking.7)The gameplay is very hard to get use to at first.8)You better rent it before you buy it.That is the truth. I wouldn't lie. I gave you the good and the bad all on 1 list."
1,raw is bore,The graphics are great and thats all. The game play is too stiff and slow. It is hard to pull of moves besides punching and kicking sinct the wrestlers block everything or recover to quickly.I am very sorry I bought this game
2,Disappointing!,"Overall, I would have to say WWF No Mercy for the 64 is a more fulfilling gaming experience for wrestling fans...does not live up to the hype. Wrestling, however, has never looked better. The intros are incredible, but there's not enough substanceto keep you coming back and the gameplay is horrific. If you're an addict to wrestling and you want some eye candy, consider purchasing. If not, you'll be picking up a $[money] coaster."
2,sux,"worst wrestling game eva!-WWF RAW is WAR SUCKSWWE RAW 2-is OKWWE Wrestlemania 21 sucks.and now there is WWE WrestleMania 22 comin` for XBox 360.I bet that one sux eswell-since its predo`s sucked bad!If THQ arn`t gonna make a good wrestling game-don`t make any at all.Since RAW is WAR was my first Xbox game-i had to play it until i got more-so i guess i awed at the graphics-which shew me that XBox graphics kiked azz,i guess it was fun thatchu could attack rivals on their way to the ring.But seriously unless you are a WWE fan and want a pile of WWF/WWE games in your closet-i guess u cud get it for that-But there are no other reason to purchse it.If u ever try it and like it..well thatsu ain`t it."
2,Bad for The X-Box's Reputation,"I Gave This Game 2 Stars Because Of Good Graphics and Good Entrances That's It. I Don't Know About anybody Else But For Me What Matters Is Gameplay, and This Game Does Not Have Quality Gameplay. I Strongly Dislike The Fact That You Have to Get The Crowd to Cheer For you, So That you'll Be Able Do Your Special Move. As One Reviewer Said if you Hit your Opponent With A Chair So Many Times They'll Begin to Cheer For Them! What Baffles Me Is Why You Unlock Clothing, For Creating a Wrestler is One Thing But Using It For A Weapon Is Positively Ridicoulus! (Example Beating Someone Up With a Bandana Or Sunglasses) Here are Some Other Things In The Game That Annoy Me:1. You Can't Put People or your Created Wrestlers In Stables2. You Can't Have your Manager Come Out with you3. Not A Wide Selections Of Moves, Taunts, and EntrancesFinal Analysis: Do Not Buy This Game, No Matter How Much your Craving a WWF Game!"
2,Save your money,"This game will NOT be very good. The makers of the game decided to focus on gameplay, which is something all game-makers should do, but they didn't focus on anything else. This means no commentary (as of yet), wrestler voices will be kept to a minimum (because of a liscensing issue with the WWF), and different match types will NOT be as varied as some of these other people have been reporting. THIS GAME WILL NOT EVEN HAVE A FULLY DEVELOPED SEASON MODE! The developpers decided to use all of the X-Box's strength on graphics."
2,Not as great as Smackdown! Just Bring It!,"Hey 12 year old kid, WWF Raw is War is not as good as good as Smackdown! JBT. Reasons why:I have just read Game Pro and they said there is NO commatary what so ever.No ladder matchesDumpster matches? Remember ECW Anarchy Rulz? That match was just retarded. And when was the last time thay had a dumpster on WWF T.V that was in use? Maybe when Cautus Jack and Terry Funk was pushed off the stage in a dumpster by the New Age Outlaws, so i wouldn't see that in the game.Brimestone match? What the hell? Are you taking all the matches off the back of the box for Anarchy Rulz or something?Inferio match? They haven't had this match in a long time. My guess is no.In my opinon this game falls flat in the matches. But the graphics look great. but I wouldn't wait 1 minute EVERY TIME for there intros(Remember Final Fantasy 8 and there GF's). I'd rent but wouldn't buy."
5,one of the best wrestling games ever,This game is perfect. I have never played a better wrestling game. I can't wait until Raw 2 comes out
2,Fun if on offense,"It seems as if anytime the opponent starts beating up on you, you can barely throw a punch. This really ruins it. Basic matches. Well, good graphics. But it's IN the ring that ruins it. Really."
2,Bad Bad Game!!,I knew this game wasn't very deep when I bought itused for 10 bucks. But even so I was SHOCKED by thelimits of this game. The roster of wrestlers isnothing to write home about and there simply isn'talot of moves you can do. The lack of matches is alsoa big negitive. I got to say that I have not playeda good wrestling game since WWF NO Mercy on the Nintendo64. Seems as though wrestling games died after that.Another thing is that the fun seems to be lacking. Youdon't have much freedom due to the crowd factor(thisshould be an option and not a unchangeable rule)and itmakes me feel tight as a gamer and you really can'tafford to play around with the oppnent at all. Just nofun here at all. Gave it to a fews son. What a poor soulhe is.
1,Don't even waste your money to rent it.,"This is the worst WWF game that has ever come out. THQ did a better job on the WCW/nWo game then this one. Some of the cgs look like the the real wreslter but most do not like anything like the real WWF Superstar. Everything that was hyped the game up was taken out. There are no special matches like in the Smackdown Series. I won't waste my money on the game, even to just rent it."
2,Raw blows,"Although this game has outstanding graphics and cool finishers and nice entrances there is no royal rumble, no ladder, no cage, no guest referee, and you can't go backstage. Also you can't go into the crowd. The gameplay is great but it is missing so many features. The creat a superstar is really good. it is missing a storyline in one player mode. a lot of the features it was supposed to have it doesn't."
2,Not worth the $$$,"OK... the no blood, I could live with. The no fighting in the crowd... I could live with... Only Raw arena to fight in... I could live with! But I can't live without some assemblence of a storymode. This game is so boring I'm speechless... Uhh $$ bucks and I'm gonna play this piece of crap like 10 times. You can't edit wrestlers attires. The fact that Haku, KKwick and Eddie Guerrero are in this game make me wanna puke... Blackman and Kaientai should have stayed on the shelf as well. VERY VERY disappointing... THQ better have a strong rebound with the next title for Xbox... but ne-way the graphics and entrances are fat as hell and the fighting off the ramp is cool so thats where the 2 stars come from... but other than that D-I-S-A-P-P-O-I-N-T-I-N-G!!!"
2,doesn't live up to the hype,I'm a big wrestling fan and xbox fan but this game just was disapointing.The graphics look great exept for a few characters like hhh.HHH's face doesn't even resemble him at all.well to start the game controls are the biggest disapointment.When u push the a button you'll punch one time and kick another.doesn't seem to be any pattern.No matter how much i try i can't figure these contols out to save my life.And another thing that pissed me off was that i picked the big show and went up against crash holly.He was suplexing me and bodyslamming and everything.Not too realistic!!!!The game has a great look to it but overall it is a waste of money.
1,Cheating! 11 year old,"When I do a finisher they kick out, then I stay down forever, then they pin me and win. But, they get right back up! You should not waste your money buying or renting it!"
1,Quite possibly the worst wrestling game ever,This game pretty much has the best definition of sucks.The entrance videos you can watch is cool in the history section or whatever you call it. But the game is pretty much badProsGood graphicsYou can watch there full music videos in the history biagraphy thing....and thats pretty much itConsvery slow pacedgets boring after 4 minutesno season modeno street fightNO HELL IN THE CELLFOR CRYING OUT LOUD THERES NOT EVEN A FRIGGIN CAGE MATCH HERE. Even the original raw for psx had more crap than this...No Divas I think...Graphics can get fuzzyAND MORE!DONT GET THIS GAME TRUST ME!!!! GO With smackdown shut your mouth and here comes the pain.....This game sucks
2,whats up with raw,"Listen i have ps2 and smackdown jbi was okay but raw [disappoints] my father buys it for me it has no story mode just championship matches.The moves are retarded... No offense but triple h looks like he has [a genetic problem]. Beileve me the matches are missing whatever happened to hell in cell, tlc, casket, backstage brawls it [disappoints] bottom line.The stars are for the museum..."
4,Words from a Wrestling Game fanatic,"This game, is a very good one, although it has several faults in it w/o a doubt. I have played every single wrestling game from WWF and WCW, minus WM2000 and WCW Superbrawl on SNES. I can say, that this game was obviously designed for the real show. Thats why their is no Royal rumble, Ladders, TLC or Hell in a Cell. ITs built around the show. The roster is pretty good and the graphics are awesome, minus a few things like how HHH looks. The controls are hard to learn cause, well, look at the conroller for Xbox, its very complicated to use.After a while its simple and the format of a match is great. I personally hate smackdown because you win matches in like 1:00 w/o much of a struggle, and this game shows difficulty, having to lay out a gameplan so your guy doesnt get tired too fast, and to work the crowd. Im more mad that theirs no backstage but you can't win em all."
3,Not bad. But...........Could be better,"WWF Raw is ground breaking as far as graphic's go. NO Wrestling game comes close to it in that aspect. But alot is left out. No Season mode, Lack of match's and No Jim Ross. They could done more to make the game have more staying power. Personly I wish they would've just cleaned up the graphic's and the bugs from Smackdown for PS2 and just released that for the X-box. Smackdown just had more depth. Something WWF Raw lacks bigtime."
1,well,no blood no royal rumble and no season and no cage macth this game has good people but you cant get to know them because theres no season and no blood no cages this game is the worst one x box can do better than this descraceful thing
1,What a bad bad bad game,This game does not even have a season mode.It has a limited amount of characters.There will be no Hell in a cell.Hay if your getting this game for your kids.This is bad There is to much blood.If you want to buy a game get SMACKDOWN3 JUST BRING IT FOR PS2.CAUSE ITS ALOT BETTER THAN RAW IS WAR.
2,RAW for Xbox a bit of a letdown,"After waiting months for this title to ship, I have to say I'm disappointed, no real career mode, and they've gone too far away from the N64 style of control. The camera angle is also horrible, and can not be adjusted. I don't see why many changes would be made to the No Mercy for N64 control style. Dozens of moves at your fingertips with no problem. If its not broken don't fix it. The roster is also outdated, although i know there isnt much that can be done about that. Did I mention the camera angle sucks, good, cause it's really bad. Oh yeah, and the controls. No good. Maybe I need to get used to it, but I may not be playing it often enough to get used to it. If i wanted 6 moves at my disposal I'd play the Smackdown... on PS2"
4,WWF,"WWF is a great game for wrestling fans.The graphics are good, but not great lacking some of the textures we see on other games.But the gameplay of this game is great. Anything is possible, which makes this game great.WWF offers a whole lot, every match avalable, almost every wrestler, and even create-a-wrestler, which is so awesome.But after awhile of playing the game, its starts to get old and boring at times. This game i'd say whould have to be a rental. But if you really like wrestling this games for you..."
1,Raw Is War looks TERRIBLE!,"The graphics in RIW will be great, but that won't make up for everything else. THERE IS NO SEASON! There are only 6 or 8 different match types and a creat-a-wrestler option. That's seriously about it.Even if you are a WWF fan... PLEASE GO BUY WWF SD3 AND BE SATISFIED. Don't upset yourself."
1,Not worth it,"Raw is War... All graphics with no substance what so ever. First off, there is no formal season mode. NO SEASON! Secondly, a game with, and I admit Raw has it, phenominal graphics falls second to a game that has more content and gameplay than anything else, with graphics not far behind. Take my advice, wait and rent this game first, if you really like it get it, but dont get it off the bat, it could be the worst decision you make."
4,"Very good, but lacks something...........","WWF Raw gives you the best graphics that you can get.The Entrances and moves look exactly the same as ifyou are watching television. The sound is great. Thesuperstars are excellent. But the one thing thattotally needs work is the gameplay. First of all, youcan't go backstage because there are no backstagearenas. There are not nearly as many types of matchesas there are in Smackdown! for PS2... In my opinion,I think that the worst part is that you can't climbladders,(which really stinks). You can create awrestler which is very fun. And there is career mode.Career mode is when you can go after any belt,(besides tag team). What [is dissapointing] in that mode is thatthe players don't talk..."
3,WWF Raw is an ALRIGHT game,"This game is ALRIGHT and alright only. I got this game and turned on my consle (ive been waiting for months for this game) and when the game got started i wondered where all the different match types and arenas were. so then i went to gameplay and found astonashing graphics, but i also found you can't go in the crowd or backstage. i started usong weapons and found you cant climb ladders or lay people on tables. the 1 cool thing about the weapons are that when they break instead of disappearing u can pick up broken peices. All in all the games graphics and entrances are awsome but i am ashamed that they lied about all the features."
2,Facts From A Person Who Owns The Game!,"WWF RAW is the WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! I am an avid gamer, too. So, trust me! I'll make a list of things this game DOESN'T have...> Season> 6 Man Tag> Hell In A Cell> Cage> Backstage> Interactive Crowd> Talking (If grunts count!)Here's a list of stuff it does have...>Absolutely nothing! Once you get past the eye candy of the entrance, you'll soon realize, there's not much to the game! One button does about 4 different things. This game was a waste of THQ's time, and my dad's money. Avoid this game at all costs!"
5,Black Vinegar,This item made by Gold Plum is the best black vinegar I have had. I had it served to me as a dipping sauce for dumplings and I fell in love. I also put it in my soup. I am waiting for Amazon to get some in.
5,Hatfields and McCoys,"After reviewing several different books about the Hatfields and McCoys, I found this book to be factual, organized, and easy to read."
3,I found an error in the genealogy,"Rice lists Rose Anna McCoy's Aunt Betty as ""Betty Blankenship McCoy"" on page 21. Without being able to contact him as to how he determined this, I have to contest it.My great-great-grandmother was Aunt Betty-- Elizabeth Rutherford McCoy. She was married to Uriah McCoy, not Allen McCoy, as Rice writes. She is buried with Uriah in our family cemetery, just above her house, which is on the Hatfield-McCoy Trail tour as the house where Rose Anna stayed and had her baby.Other than that, I assume his information is correct, though I will be thoroughly researching what he reports."
3,Old Info,"This is an older book from a regional college professor. He goes on and on about his pedigree and the pedigree of the folks who helped him get the book into print. At the time he published it, it was probably accurate. However, we know much more now than we did at the time of his writing. If you are like me and collecting all things published about the two families and their culture, then buy it. It's worth adding to your collection in the sense that in 2012, we can see just how much a lot of the info has changed. Consider it the first book of your collection."
4,Good History,Overall it was a good history and I found it easy to read. There maybe other books that go into greater detail but I was able to get a good understanding of story. I loved the mini-series which is why I purchased the book
2,Disapointed,"Very thin paperback, was told in the description that it was a hardback. Very over priced and not many pictures."
2,Not as advertised,"I ordered this book about the Hatfields and McCoys because it was advertised as a hardback. Upon receipt it is NOT hardback, but paperback. I would never have paid this amount for this type of book. Amazon needs to check into what is labeled hardback. It's larger than a usual paperback but would never be considered hardback by anyone."
2,didn't contain the full story.,Details were omitted.Author was staying on the safe end. I will choose a didifferent author.Igotten t enon the safe end. same
2,:(,I was really excited about this book. There are way to many people to try and keep up with I was so confused. I'll stick with the movie.
2,Not impressed,The brooch was cheap because it is. The overall quality of the brooch isn't the best and the colors are dark and the crystals aren't brilliant. Two of the crystals were not set properly.
2,The sequel is almost to market: wait for it,"Honestly, unless you're LucasArts completist collector, there's no longer any reason to buy this game. With the pending sequel, JEDI STARFIGHTER, many of the things that annoyed people about STARFIGHTER SE (like its highly inadequate multiplayer environment) are going to be addressed--and, we hope, resolved. GIve this one a miss."
4,Decent game but I want the original trilogy,"Starfighter is a pretty cool game from Lucas though I wish Rougue Leader and the new Racer were available for X-box.Starfighter has a decent story line with 15 missions ranging in difficulty. There are some pretty cool bonus missions as well. ""The Final Assault"" will test your skills as that Mercinary Ship is a tough kill. All in all it was a good purchase."
2,It was......well......boring!!,"It hurts to write a bad review for a star wars game, being as big a fan as I am. However, this game did not live up to my expectations. First complaint are the dull, boring ships you fly. Maybe you're excited about flying Naboo fighters but I'd prefer a TIE Fighter or X-Wing anyday. Then you get these weak missions that if you put it on Easy it's no challenge, if you put it on normal you'll be dead before you knonw who's firing at you. I also didn't like the open space part of it. My favorite aerial game is StarFox where you're always flying forward and into action and this fly everywhere stuff didn't excite me.However, I'm not saying you won't enjoy this game. You only won't enjoy it if you share my sentiments listed above."
3,Not the greatest,Definetly would have been better as the trilogy. The graphics were cool but it's just so pointless. You do the same thing over and over. You have one mission and then the next. It would have been cooler if there were more ships. You get 3 ships and they [are not good]. I like Rogue Squadron tons better than this but this was still exciting. You might buy it if you like the new Star Wars. It's not too exciting BUT the 2-player mode is incredibly cool for a flying game like Star Wars. That is a new thing. I gave it a three cuz it was average. Many Star Wars [fans] might like it. It's ok!
4,A near miss.,"I've been playing PC-based Star Wars flights sims since the very first X-Wing back in 1994. So with my brand-new X-Box, I was looking forward to some seriously improved graphics and gameplay a bit more lighthearted than for the PC.I got what I wanted -- and less.There's one HUGE problem with this game. Your right thumbstick controls your rolls. But the buttons under your right thumb control your firing. So how the heck are you supposed to maneuver and fire at the same time? I'm about to give up."
3,Hmm,I use to own this for the PS2 years ago. I wanted to play it again so I bought it for the Xbox thinking it would work on my 360. To my dismay it doesn't. I couldn't even play it again so I sold it.
1,I thought this would work on my X Box,I bought this because I new nothing of X Box 360 I did not know it would not work on it dua
3,Not really special,"Whats so special about this game? Well, nothing really. Its not bad. I mean I really liked the PS2 edition. I was really hoping they would improve on the Xbox version alot and they, uh, didn't. It's fun with good graphics and controls though. If you own the original then you might want to just skip this one. If not then go ahead and buy it."
1,Based on the original...,"I don't belive there have been playable demos of this game yet, but the original (on PS2) was a nightmare. The only good thing is that part of the problem was the terrible grpahics, which can be fixed on the xbox. The only problem is that the gameplay will need to be more diverse and entertaining, and most starwars fans will be looking to Star Wars: Rouge Squadrine 2 by the time this comes out, which plays like a masterpeice. If they do improve the title, it still might not be too good."
3,Straight....,This game is alright but once you beat it it gets kind of old. The bonus levels are a cool addition to the XBOX version of the game but the multiplayer modes/levels are not that various and are not as fun as expected. If you are a star wars fan it is worth renting before you buy it. I would have still gotten it if I played it before I bought it I GUESS.
4,I am Nym,"I am not a 5 hour a day gamer, I simply enjoy these when I can.Star Wars Starfighter SE is a fantastic game. I have gone through half the levels and it keeps getting better. The various situations for each level, make the game new and fresh. That is, first you are in a canyon, then space, then you must escort a pirate ships etc.The only part of the game I don't like, is the same with most games; there is very little instruction included, and not being a gamer, it takes a while to figure it out. It is however well worth the money."
1,"Maybe great, but.....","Sure the graphics and gameplay may be souped up from PS2, but want me and most other people seemed to be more excited about is Star Wars: Rogue Squadron 2 on GameCube. The consoles cheaper and the game (RL) is a better game."
5,GREAT BUT...,It reminded me of Goosebumps #12 be careful what you wish for. It wasn't a whole great book. Some parts were a lot better than others and others well...That's my review
4,Just Okay,"Even though it has a weird ending,there is nothing scary about it.I don't think it is a graeat book,but there is something in it that makesme keep on reading. I'll guess I'llrecommend it."
2,I want revenge on R.L.Stine for writing us,"Wade Brill has the standard annoying sibling, Micah, in this annoying Goosebumps 2000 installment. As usual, Wade is frustrated because it seems he can do no wrong, constantly humiliating her. THis storyline is so over-used in Goosebumps books, and the idea of failed revenge is uninteresting. And the ending disappoints, throwing off the whole confusing and blase storyline."
1,One star is a stretch,"Sometimes the old saying""ya get what ya pay for"" is exactly that.Not in this case however. If a woodwindinstrument is what you're looking for,look elsewhere.I ended up making an entirely differentinstrument all together. See it had holesdrilled in it so I hung some empty nitrousbulbs from fishing line and made myselfa wind-chime. If you're looking for a cheapwoodwind instrument I don't recomendthis one...peace"
4,"Sex, drugs, confusion and sleep filled with nightmares...","Sounds like a good book? You bet. I won't give away any of the plot -- the main reason is that the plot is so intricate, and woven behind threads of lies, half-truths, mis-direction, conspiracies and lack of clarity that not only the reader is drawn in trying to piece the puzzle together, but the main character is as well.Intrigued? Get the book. I promise you'll be drawn into the lush landscape, the fully-realized characters, and the mystery of the Kingfoil."
4,a riddle inside a puzzle wrapped in an enigma,"This is the feel of this book. Young tristam is more than a scientist but everyone knows it but him. He becomes a pawn in a political game following a plant with reputed magical properties to a tropical island.The characters are brightly written even if a bit cliche. The innocent hero, the manipulative dutchess, the psychopathic noble and the rought but good hearted sailors. However the author keeps the voyage alive by hints and descriptions of what is going on. At the end you still don't really now what Tristam is but you known that he is more valuable than the plant they seek. It does dry out a bit in places but not to loose your interest in the story and inspires you to read the next book"
4,Absolutely love it!,"I absolutely LOVE this watch. It is sleek, stylish and classy looking. I always get very positive comments about this watch. Great buy."
5,Do you like things that are funny?,"If you like things that are funny, you will like this book. I own it because I am a fan of EVERYTHING that is funny, and this book is number one on that list. I am not even kidding about this."
5,Great Book - Is almost fatfree,It is the best second generation tamil vegetarian cookbooks around.... Most recipes use very little oil and are high in protein... It is beautifully illustrated and has great authentic recipes....
5,A very good cookbook for beginners!,"Kudos to Ms Varadarajan for having brought out such a little known cuisine! I have been searching for 'Palghat' recipes for a very long time. Thank God I found very good ones in 'Samayal'. Besides the wonderful photographs, I found an excellent selection of 'rasams' (the south Indian soups) which is the toughest to master. I am quite often in a quandary as to what to prepare for the family. 'Samayal' has solved all that for me. The book deserves all praise!"
3,Coffee Table,"I thought the recipes were good, but the flow of the book made it hard to consider as a cookbook for frequent use. It seems more suitable for the coffee table. I guess one could photocopy recipes, but the problem then would be the layout of text, it seems to flow in a very odd manner; cut off right in the middle of a recipe and continuing in odd form on another page."
2,Excellent recipes...,"I am a connoisseur of South Indian cuisine, especially from the Palakkad and Tanjore regions the author covers in the book. How I looked forward to getting this book and cooking up what I like most!Recipes are authentic and excellent. Like Gramdmom's...Book flow can do better with a list of contents and an index. Perhaps the second edition will have them..."
5,A MUST HAVE BOOKFOR SURE!!,"when i bought samayal,it was just another cook book...iwas certain i'd give up with trying dishes out of it like i had with so many others....but i was truly & pleasantly prooved wrong!the recipes i tried turned out just delicious & more impotantly,HEALTHY!!!the author's simple & easy to follow language & directions make cooking delightful...& the results even better....on the whole A MUST for every home."
2,"Misleading, poor customer service","First and foremost it must be mentioned that the poster has a very large white border all around, which though in the image, is made virtually impossible to see due to the white background of the image. The plastic slide frame also is only on top and bottom and does not extend the full width of the poster. Beware, this poster looks nothing like the image when on the wall. Furthermore, the seller did not update the shipping status until six days after I purchased the item, and did not respond to my attempt to contact them. Simply put, I wouldn't recommend buying from them and I will not be doing so in the future.For the record: the dimensions of the actual image measure 34"" x 9.75"""
2,Somewhat of a Disappointment,"As a graduate student of security policy at Columbia University, I was excited to read Nutter's book. Although it raised interesting questons, it was somewhat disappointing. Information is largely anecdotal and lightly supported and analyzed. Unusually poor editing makes for a sometimes irritating read for those who care about such things. I appreciate Nutter's main aim, which is to examine--and question--the wisdom and risks inherent in covert action. However, he falls victim himself to the alluring mystique of ""Black Ops"" (one look at book's jacket gives good clues as to what's inside). I'm sure Nutter had fun researching and writing the book, and you may find it fun to read; I did, despite myself. And there's the rub--it's easy for those attempting to show how ""Black Ops"" substitute for coherent foreign policy to succumb to their dramatic veneer and avoid a real and necessary scholarly contribution on the subject. Read the book, but think for yourself."
5,"Authoritative, revealing, fascinating reading.","From covert acts against Hussein to secret Afghan missions and the overthrow of leaders and governments around the world, The CIA's Black Ops charts the CIA's secret operations and controversial plans, revealing a country fascinated by covert action and surveying how such operations have become a part of U.S. foreign policy. Essential for any surveying international politics."
1,misleading title,"Be careful this is for ONE connector only, not a bag of 10! Although the seller refunded my money, I still regard this as a trap."
2,Be aware,"Make sure you check the Manufacturer of the mini-RGB cable you are going to use, as each manufacturer uses a different connector.I couldn't use these."
2,Has Problems,"I am an IT consultant. I was looking for a very good reliable laptop. I purchased my 4030 for 1290 when dells sold at 799 with better features.Problems:Its slow! My Inspirion same processor etc. is faster by a long shot.The mousepad stops responding constantly! It apparently happens to many HP;s Google it.Order it with Broadcom Wireless. Intel wireless solution drops connection. It reconnects fast but it happens regularly.The O key on my keyboard sticks.The screen blinks into a bios type mode (i.e. when video software is corrupt) I have tried everything it still happens, waiting fo video card to go :(Thats my 2 sense, I would look a little farther if i were to purchase again. I have owned it for 6 months.Good Luck"
3,Light and fluffy,"This album was disappointing, and JMcG decided to feature the flute patch on his new Synclavier guitar rather than lay down the Fusion Law. It's light and fluffy and there is nothing memorable at all on this album. I think Billy Cobham quit the band very soon after the beginning of the project, or the tour anyway. I went to see the band play on the tour, and Danny Gottleib (Pat Metheney) had replaced him. Milos Forman and Jonas Hellborg were on hand. JMcG started the show playing a Les Paul for ONE SONG. Then he switched to Synclavier guitar...well it was a fantastic show. Gottleib didn't seem to know the tunes very well so McG was constatntly giving him cues, but Gottleib SMOKED! I went back and listened to the album again, but I couldn't make any connection between what I saw and this album. I've tried to sell this album many times but no one wants it."
1,A high-tech snoozefest,"This is a sad example of high expectations and trendy technology colliding with the suits, all gone horribly wrong. Sad to say, despite the presence of very high calibre musicians, the compositions are at best weak fuzak-lite and are in no way shape of form representative of the brilliance that John McLaughlin was capable of.One of the most maddening things, besides the weak material, is the fact that Johnny Mac's guitar synth is completely indistinguishable from the heavy synth-overkill dominating the album. Its rather dated 80's production values are no help either.Skip this turkey."
2,azurik-save your money,"dont buy this, wait for better games, save your money...linear gameplay, annoying enemies take to long to kill and regenerate when you die or reload from save, with cheats its better cause you can save anywhere, but its still [hard]..."
2,No good,"This game was by far the worst I have ever played. First off the whole idea of accumulating gems reminds you of sonic the hedgehog without the speed. The monsters are repetitive and boring. Your moves are repetitive and boring. Your quest to find key's and turn on switches is repetitive and boring. The only relief is the movie scenes which are great. Unless you want to play this game for 800 hours use a walkthrough. Some parts are imppossible to beat without cheats, although most the game is extremely easy."
5,Azurik is Great,"Before i bought this game, I wasnt sure how good it would be. But let me tell you that this game is frickin awesome. You'll get used to the controls in minutes. The graphics for this game are unbelievable. The gameplay is good. You can explore the entire world once you get the four elements which is not hard to do. And this game is promised to last you for a long time. I've had the game for about three weeks and I'm still in the first portion of the game. And the reason is not that its hard to play, its just fun to explore places and the game is long. If your looking for a game to really get your money worth and play for a long time, buy Azurik."
3,You'll need skill and patience to play this one,"Graphics are good, sound is ok. If you like Zelda for N64 then you'll like Azurik too.Rent it first, then you decide to buy it or not..."
4,"Not so solid, but a run for your money","I have heard a lot said about Azurik, some negative, others positive, mostly ngative. I just want to make a few things clear, this here is a GOOD game, it shouldn't be overlooked by Action/Adventure fans, oh, there's sort of a RPG feel, but in the long run,it's just not there. I have played this game a lot, twice just for the run, the others for the feel, I love the feel, it's true action for your hands. Yes the controls are hard to get, well actually, the buttons on the controller are colored as the elements in the game, so it's easy to get the element right in the heat of battle. Fast hands develope better skils at element triggering. So, here is the overall scoop, a good game at a good price and many hours glued to your tv screen. A better pick than Oddworld, Genma, and Obi-Won. Pick it up, or rent it."
1,"Waste of money, waste of time","This game was entertaining for about 3 hours then it became a frustration. Since you can only save your progress at pre-specified points within the game and the distance between them is so great that if Azurik looses his life (and he will) you then have to start playing again way back where you started.There might actually be 72 plus hours of game here, but after only 8 hours of playing, which equals 1 hour of actual progress, I'm already so bored with the game I can't stand to look at it.The graphics are merely okay... and after viewing the same scenes over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over ... well you get the picture."
1,"Azurik, the piece of crap","This game is the worst game I've ever played. There isn't much of a story line, the fighting is very limited, and the graphics are horrible. It was so bad, that it should have been on the PS2. It doesn't deserve to be on the XBOX. This game is worse than the old 64 bit Superman game. Trust me, I have this game and it's only worth about 10 dollars."
1,"Good graphics, but what's the point?","This game has decent graphics but there doesn't seem to be any point. You just run around like a freaked out smurf, slashing things that basically just stand there most of the time. The story line is non-existent and the main character is void of any personality at all. There aren't any mid-level saves and it's easy to fall off of a cliff and have to weave your way through areas you've already explored. Oh, and did I mention that you have to pick up coins as you progress? (GROAN) I mean, haven't we moved past that in the video game world? On a platform as great as XBox, there are far better games out there, rent don't buy."
2,This game [stinks].,"Azurik is a game that wastes your time and does not take full advantage of the XBOX hardware. I think the makers of Azurik were sleeping while they were making the game because there is no part of the game that is cool. The floor is messed up the ceiling, the walls, the lamp, the chandelier, etc."
2,Azurik is a pretty bad game,"Azurik is a pretty bad game. It very quickly becomes boring, has a very bad plot and the whole game is just.....kind-of stupid. (C'mon, you go around fighting polka-dotted lizards and looking for crystals as a blue guy who likes the adult version of Skeeter from the Cartoon Doug) Do not waste your time or money on this game. Before I played it I thought it was going to be a great game, I read previews and good reviews. I was very, very wrong. The only redeeming quality of this game is the graphics, it might be fun for some people, (I heard it gets better later in the game, so I'll give it 2 stars instead of one)but I could barely play for 10 minutes. Ugh. Spend your money on great games like Halo, Dead Or Alive 3, Project Gotham Racing, NFL Fever 2002 etc. But you don't have to listen to me, rent it if you must and see for yourself. But remember, I warned you........"
1,Huge disappointment,"Why you ask?The story line was pathetic. They did nothing to make me care about the character or the mission. Absolutely terrible voice acting. It sounds like it was recorded by a single monotonic zombie. The soundtrack seems like it was made by a 8 year old learning to play a 24 key synth. The graphics .. oh the graphics. It was like they took a basic directx demo, made a few tweaks and published it. In comparison to Halo which paid attention to the smallest details, this game is a pure waste of time. Do not buy it!"
2,Would have been nice to have options,"Poor controls. And you can't customize them. What!?! Yes, eventhough every good game in the last 5 years+ allows you to cusotmize the controls, this one doesn't. In fact the only options you have are sound levels. This is really annoying when the controls are non-standard and you must control the camera yourself for 90% of the game.The game itself is average, but its just too annoying to play."
3,Not too bad after all,"I rated this game before and was not very kind. Well... I was told that it took a bit of time to get into it but once I did, I would change my opinion. My opinion has indeed been changed. Its a pretty cool game. While there are still some things that bug me, I am into the story now and its compensating for the unpolished parts of the game."
1,BOOOOO!!!,"Halo is a much better game! I started with Azurik, and it ws fun. Then 20 minutes later I tried Halo, then MX2002, and 4 more games. Azurik was way below my expectations. This game is the least fun I have ever had. Compared to other games, this is sooo dumb! The storyline is just like Zelda, you gotta save some dumb planet from people. The graphics are only good on the videos. And I dont even want to START about the controls. I reccomend renting this game, and spending your good $$$ on Halo."
2,Its OK,"I got this game knowing what it was about, but frankly, its not any HALO. Its misguided, It could have been a good game, but it is not addictive, it can be boring to people who always need action in their games. Overal: 2 stars"
2,sucky game man,this game sucks so horibly that I had to play halo for an hour afterward to prevent myself from hurling my xbox across the room.In other words: DON'T BUY IT!!!!!
3,decent play,"I was forced to read this for a class I was taking but I was pleasantly surprised that once I read the part I needed to read I felt that I had to continue to the end. The play is about some people from the 50's or 60's that live in a small town and look forward to some dumb ""picnic"". Several characters are well developed having well defined objectives."
4,Great for Experienced SMS Administrators.,"While this book does offer tidbits of information for beginners, it is primarily for advanced users of SMS. Once you are familiar with SMS, this book becomes invaluable as a reference tool."
3,Covers all areas but not elaborate,"I would recommend this book to individuals that have sat through the sms classes to brush up on their knowledge. However, not for the beginner! For the beginner, use it in conjuction with SMS 2.0 training kit from Microsoft Press."
1,Need more info,"I have read many SMS books and this is one of the worst. The author has no practical knowledge about large scale environments and how to support them. Everything is very vague and talks in circles. I want technical nitty gritty details about SMS. Too much theory, not enough practical knowledge."
5,It fits as advertised!,"Since I now have to park out in the sun in Florida with an 11-year-old car, I wanted some protection for the interior. This sunshade fits my windshield perfectly as advertised. It fits so well that I haven't even had to use the visors to keep it in place."
1,garbage,"Why pay $118 for this here when you can buy the same timing light here for $34 to $52. Let me explain, 4 guys who are members of a local car club, me and 3 others. We become friends and hang out in each others shops and what do you know!!! 3 of us have the same otc timing light sold here and 1 has the Actron timing light sold here. Same cheap material same crappy contruction all the same size and shape, all no longer used because they all have electrical shorts in the leads near the handle of the light. None of these lights has lasted long so if you insist on buying it then at least pay less. I am a big fan of OTC tools I have a lot of their stuff in my shop but shame on them for this."
3,"""Sunday School"" DVD","This is a low budget film with a Christian focus. I was not expecting much and w/o a doubt the lead actress is not the best with her acting, but I found the story to be very cute and actually liked the film."
3,Functional if unrefined,"Good points:* Flexible blade does indeed slide under things.* Useful size for eggs and grilled cheese sandwiches.* Dishwasher-safe-ish.Bad points:* Handle is made of a plastic that melts at surprisingly low temperatures--the side of a frying pan even at moderately low heat.* Handle is riveted to blade quite loosely--there is play when the handle flexes. It feels like something is shaking loose, even though this is functionally irrelevant.* Blade is cheaply made--it is not smooth, but slightly pitted, at the business end."
4,Lamson Shart turner,"Excellent turner, good size and flexibility. The only drawback is the material that the handle is made of. It will not sustain heat at all, so if it gets against the rim of a skillet or griddle it will melt promptly."
1,Cheap,"This item came and I immediately sent it back once I handled it. The handle was cheap and it was also loose when we recieved ours and the whole thing was very flexible, which isn't what I want in a spatula. Not a good product, especially for the price. Could have found something better at walmart."
2,Great looking but poorly made,"I purchased both a brown and black pair of these shoes to wear to work. They fit nicely and looked great. I walk approximately 2 blocks a day to work on city sidewalks. Within 4 - 5 months, chunks of the rubber soles on the back of both pairs of shoes began to fall off in pieces. I've never seen anything like it. I ended up throwing them both away after about 8 months and bought a pair of Dockers (still new, so no opinion there).Again, I think this is a great looking shoe, but its durability for even light use is a big issue. Because of that, I would have a hard time buying another pair of Stacy Adams shoes again."
5,Beautiful works by Virginia Zeani,"This cd is a masterful set of arias. The beautiful voice of Virginia Zeani floats across your ears. Noted as one of the top ""italian"" singers, Zeani takes a commanding lead in this recording."
4,Someone who's not pandering to the pop market,"I first heard Anthony Smith online- not on the radio. ""If that ain't country"" sounded so fun! I think it's cool that he's a songwriter- I respect that. His voice is very different from the guys that are out there now in country."
2,Bad tasting..,"My kids are usually very good about taking chewable vitamins so I thought I'd give this echinacea a try. They said it tasted awful, so I cannot recommend this."
2,Very disappointed,"I too was mislead into believing that I was getting all four of the packs. Of course, you don't get to pick which one you get and so I got one that I already had. The one I really wanted had Daisy. Since she is so hard to find, I was willing to buy all of them. But, I didn't get her and so it was a waste of money. Do not buy from this unless you don't care which one you will get."
4,Low calorie Trance.,"2 CDs packed with a highly addictive synthetic Trance/House vibe. CD1 has some very melodic and catchy tunes that will rattle around your head for weeks, 'White' track 2 for example, a summery house anthem that could grace any dancefloor, anywhere.CD2 is a continuous mix based on the same ingredients as CD1 : A constant 4/4 beat cut up with the incisive hi-hat, a trademark throughout, and the duo never stray from this blueprint.Circulation seem to be at home creating upbeat synthetic house moments, low calorie trance music that doesn't challenge the head too much. So don't look to this release for deep twisted house a la Northern Exposure. Think of it more as functional trance. It does its job well even if it becomes predictable over time.Colours is quite an addictive release that will get lazered non-stop for some time, but after many listens the music becomes somewhat forgettable...Good party music that doesn't take itself too seriously."
5,Beautiful piece.,I ordered this statue for my father for Christmas because my mother will not let my father have a Winged Victory statue in the front yard. it is a beautiful piece.
3,Bait and Switch Tactic,"The only reason I gave this book three stars is because the books that it contains are actually some of my favorites. Having said that, however, I REALLY object to the publishers putting compilations of previously published books out under new titles without stamping ""REISSUE OF PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED WORK""in HUGE red letters on the front. I've purchased too many of these thinking they were books that I hadn't yet read, only to find out that they are the same old books -- just a new cover and or title. FOUL PLAY!!!"
2,Sheets from Amazon,"The quality of the sheets is great. I was just a little thrown off by the color. The color that appeared on the Amazon website was VERY different from the color that I received. I am not a color expert, and was not aware the Ecru is a nasty peach color that clashes with most everything. Had the color appeared on your website as the true color and not an offwhite, I would not have purchased the sheets."
4,Color didn't match the picture,"The sheets that I received did not match the color (Ecru) of the picture on the Amazon.com' site. But I must say that the sheets do feel good and so far, it washes well too. Very good value for the price."
1,So Disappointing,"Perhaps this sheet set should be sold at the $200 price listed. Then perhaps the buyer would be able to afford to hire somone to iron them. And a seamstress to resew the hems that fell apart after the first washing (following the instructions). Even if you enjoy sewing, having to iron a queen set is not fun. And if you're expecting ""ecru"" as the color, do not be disappointed with the pastel peach. In no way can I suggest this 500 ct. sheet set to anyone. I am returning these."
5,I'm biased: he's my grandfather!,"Lewis ""Buck"" Crook was my grandfather. For me, my brothers, my cousins, and the rest of my family, the Crook Book, as it is affectionately known, is a great source of pride. I developed a web site dedicated to the life and work of Buck Crook. A number of pictures from the Crook Book are featured there."
5,Buy it!!!,"For me this album is the album of the years!!The guitarist are crazy and very talented very good solo!The bass is excellent too, clear and heard it well.The drummer it's a girl and she's impressionante good play with double bass drums and with the cymbales.Each toune are excellent exept the 1 was so so.The vocal are brutal but listenable is good because the lyrics are understanding!"
3,Not for my Callie ~!~,"I was a bit confused on this product , it says cats and dog treat , but on the bag it just says dog..I gave some to both Pasha and Callie , Pasha refused to eat it { and believe me she does not turn down food willingly } and to my chagrin Callie got sick twice..My mom has a dog , so I will gift to her..I have tried the bravo brand prior to choosing this one ,I think I will stay with that ..Glad others are having success though , it looked great when I wet some, and smelled great 2..but Alas , it's a no-go..~!~"
5,Cat loves it,"Thought this was freeze-dried beef muscle but turns out to be a mixture of beef liver, kidney, heart, tripe and bone plus some beef muscle. Because it's a mix it isn't fibrous like the last freeze-dried beef treats I bought. Cat likes it much better because the texture is easier to chew - crunchy but not tough or stringy. Also, it's easier to break up into smaller bits since my cat prefers them to large chunks. Only preservative is Vit E so it's not full of chemicals."
2,Stick with the Arcade Version,"I really hate to write a negative review for a game that has everyone else seems to like. But sadly, Mrs Pac-man on the Sega Genesis just didn't work for me. I am a huge fan of Mrs. Pac-man in the arcades and the Sega Genesis controller is one of my favorite controllers ever. Unfortunately, the two do not go well together. I found it nearly impossible to control Mrs. Pac-man using the Genesis controller, I simply couldn't get the character to go in the direction I wanted. I even tried using an Atari 2600 joystick (which is compatible with the Sega Genesis) and while that gave me a little more control, it simply didn't have the accuracy the Arcade joystick provides. That being said, this game has excellent graphics and is a faithful recreation of the arcade classic so the controls are my only complaint, which, regrettably, ruin an otherwise excellent game."
3,some misinformation here,"When I talked to the folks at Swisher, they told me that this kit was required for mounting the universal mount kit2646 on my 2000 Bombardier Traxter 500 7416. This is not the case. As stated in the discription it is requred for the Traxter MAX. That machine has a longer wheel base. Be sure to check your wheel base before wasting your money."
4,Pierced By The Word: Thirty-One Meditations for Your Soul (Kindle edition),"This is a book that I have read before and highly recommend. The 31 short devotionals from the writing of John Piper cover a variety of topics on day-to-day living as a Christian with each one wrapped by a prayer for help in this area. These are good, thought-provoking, scripture-saturated lessons. The reader will benefit from spending time reading these along with scripture.The one drawback from this book (the Kindle version) is the number of typos throughout. It's as if some kind of OCR was used and it failed consistently. Multnomah needs to correct this because it seriously mars a very useful book. Despite this, I would highly recommend reading this. If the typos are too much of a distraction, but the printed copy. It's worth it."
5,Bite sized morsels,"John Piper is my favorite contemporary Christian author, so it was no surprise to me that this would be another engaging, worship inspiring work from him. His longer works such as ""The Pleasures of God"" are amazing when you have a bigger stretch of time for devotion, but this provides a perfect alternative when a larger work might put one off from even getting started. Each meditation is a bit longer than a given entry from say ""My Utmost For His Highest"" (quite possibly the quintessential daily devotional book), but still easily manageable in a single sitting."
3,Reasonable Priced Palak Paneer,Could have a bit more zing and more paneer would be great. For 10 packages this is a good price. My vegetarian college age student finds these relatively dorm friendly as they can be opened and poured into a bowl and then microwaved.
2,In context? Whose context?,"The author gives a competent account of orthodox brahminical philosophy but this is not helpful for the understanding of hathayoga. Hathayoga developed out of the traditions of Saiva asceticism and Tantra-its roots owe little to brahmanism. As it became popular (from c.1450CE onwards) it was adopted by the Hindu orthodox (particularly Advaita Vedantins). They then put their own spin on it and this is the version that Burley presents. Burley consults only 3 (or, in fact, two and a half) of the many Sanskrit texts of hathayoga, and for those three he uses poor editions. His own understanding of Sanskrit is very weak. Furthermore, he perhaps unwittingly puts forward views of the modern Hindu far right that are based in prejudice rather than scholarship (does a book on Hathayoga really need a chapter on the Aryan migration into India?)."
5,One of *the best* rock albums of all time.,"I had a friend of mine pick this up for me in Japan, as it's currently not available in the USA market (thanks to a bad deal with a less-than-honorable record label). And that's truly a shame, because even if you're not an Anthrax fan THIS album is one you want in your collection. From first riff to last you're glued to this disc listening to it. Volume 8 is full of the humor and musicianship that people would expect from a band that's been around for 20+ years. And yes I said humor. Give '604' and 'Toast to the Extras' a listen when you get the chance and you'll hear what I mean. And 'Catharsis' and 'Inside Out' are probably two of the best all out rock songs ever written by Antrax (or any *other* metal band for that matter).So, if you can get this, get it. It's worth every penny."
1,Terrible,"The guitar itself was very sleek and high quality. However, when I bought this the included install CD would not work (it was blank) and the drivers and files from the Behringer website did not work properly. The customer service for the product was terrbile from Behringer as this was a discontinued product. I ended up having to return this as I couldn't get it to work properly on my computer."
4,Very Good Book!,I have met Dr.Lazare in person no joke! I may be a kid but I heard one of his speeches. He is very inspiring to hear. He is Pyscaiatrist And is also a Chanceller and UMASS Medical School.
3,Decent blade,"Overall this blade is good. I used it to cut 1/2 inch thick quarry tile which went well for a while but then the blade began to glaze and the performance dropped dramatically. It could be dressed by running through concrete but the small advantage to that was short lived. It will still cut concrete or block easily but it's just not up to the task of extended cutting of quarry tile. Also be aware that the Amazon advertisement claims this is a wet or dry use blade, but the Dewalt packaging claims this is a wet blade only."
2,A disappointment.,"I was looking forward to getting this magazine in the mail and now, two issues later, I'm disappointed. It's a lot of really big projects in really big houses. One house of over 2500 sq. ft. was even discussed as small. The pictures are gorgeous but that's par for the course in magazines like this.I'd like to see something more realistic. Who has the money for these types of projects in these times? This is not the magazine for you if you're more of the DIY type."
3,"rare artifact, listen once then shelve","a prototypical version of what later became the great colossal youth album. id steer new fans to that album (CD includes the testcard ep), while hip archivists will enjoy (or minimally appreciate) this one. originally issued in a cassette pressing of 30, this is a loving reissue with nice reminiscence from bandmember stuart moxham. will give your collection some cred but will probably stay out of your player most of the time."
4,Quality and very useful,"I use this item with most of my pots and pans and even often when I bar-b-que...it gives you a sense of control. Unfortunately, it is not useful for non-stick/teflon pans. Otherwise, it is sturdy, good quality and feels comfortable in the hand."
5,wish I had one long ago!,This is the best spatual I've ever had! I use it for everything. it is light weight yet very sturdy and the quality is great! I will order another of these soon. I highly recommend it. It is well worth the money.
5,"VERY warm, wife loves it!","Stylish, but very warm,too. Wife wears this around the firepit and won't part with it, and has tossed out her old hat. Nice."
5,A delectable selection for the cultured gourmet,"Fine Wine In Food is an impressive collection of mouth-watering, home-cooking recipes involving the utilization of great and notable wines, from Zinfandel Meatballs, Artichokes Stuffed with Creamed Spinach, and Mussel Soup, to Great Aunt Mary's Cranberry and Walnut Chicken, Patti's Filet Mignons, and Raspberry Chocolate Mousse. A delectable selection for the cultured gourmet, offering dishes that chefs of all skill levels can easily craft to perfection, Fine Wine In Food is a first-rate recipe book and recommended for any culinary and wine connoisseur cookbook shelf."
3,some crazy bicycle riding kinda shaite,"you've honked at those crazy mthrfkrs weaving through traffic with bags of cargo and walkie talkies--but you've never asked yourself if they can write poetry; or if they represent the last stand of american fashion--postpunk primitive mad max though it may be. if you live in the sticks, buy this book and pretend you see bicycle messengers all the time. if you're the city mouse, quit your worthless job and get yerself 2 wheels."
1,where is it?,"JVC tapes are usually great for us. With this order we are having a hard time giving a proper review since we have yet to get the product that we have ordered. We are under the assumption that the holiday weekend will come a go and we expect to have them by Tue of this next week at the latest. If a new review message can be sent then, maybe we will have the product that we should already have."
1,1 star for Amazon's lack of region info not Laputa!,"IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS BLU RAY/DVD VERSION OF LAPUTA,BOTH THE BLU-RAY & DVD FOR THIS UK RELEASED VERSION ARE REGION B LOCKED! THEY WILL NOT PLAY ON REGION A/US STANDARD BLU RAY PLAYERS OR US PLAYSTATION 3 GAMING CONSOLES!

2,"Boring, poorly drawn characters and plot","I've heard good things about Prose, and this was the first of her books that I've read. What a disappointment. The characters seemed one-dimensional, and I tired quickly of Martha, with her incessant questioning, self-doubt, and reminiscing about her ex. The premise of the book sounded so interesting, but it just didn't deliver for me. My copy went to the used bookstore."
1,read something else.,"While there are rare moments of beautiful description, the characters are two-dimensional and just plain annoying, and the plot lapses into ineffective sarcasm. Not worth your time."
2,"I'm a fan of Prose, but...","Reading this novel, I wondered why Prose bothered to turn her usually sharp wit in the direction of this invented flock of bumbling New Age goddess-worshippers. I couldn't help thinking: ""Pick on someone your own size!""In Blue Angel she does exactly that, and the result is fantastic. She takes some righteous jabs at academia without abandoning her characters to full-on mockery, as she tends to do in Hunters. Guided Tours of Hell is also excellent."
4,"funny, but not hilarious","I enjoyed my first book by Francine Prose. Mostly, I thought the characters were interesting and humorous. But on the whole, what is there not to make fun of when it comes to goddess-worshiping women? A pretty easy target, these women. But a good story."
5,Wow,Mendez is second to non for his trumpet playing. Just listening to Motto Perceptio is incredible. Being a trumpeter from the past I really appreciate his style and techniques.
5,Great Inforamation,"This book is perfect for the beginner or veteran tennis player, coach, or ref who needs to know the rules of the game. It contains everything from cases and decisions to a glossary of terms and the intercollegiate rules. A must have for any tennis enthusiast."
4,"""Stomp This ! ""","Written off as a disappointment, ""Stomp 442"" rages with as much intensity as previous efforts such as ""Among the Living"" or ""Sound of White Noise"". Highlights include ""Fueled"" ""In a Zone"", and ""Tester"", a blistering track about staying true to your roots and not submitting to fads! Bonus tracks include ""Grunt and Click"", a great cover of Iron Maiden's ""Remember Tomorrow"", Kiss' ""Watching You"", a cover of Celtic Frost's ""Dethroned Emperor"", a cover of the Police song ""No Time this Time"", and Husker Du's ""Celebrated Summer"". A must have for true metal fans."
3,Question - Can a book be too comprehensive?,"You wouldn't get this book to learn phrases to use... you would use it to understand other people.There is just one small problem... most people misuse expressions a lot because they have incorrectly assumed what they mean or heard someone else use them wrong, so you could never be sure what is written here is what was actually meant, and it does nothing to help with people's lack of clarity and precision and honesty when speaking in general, which as a person with AS myself I have found a bigger problem than understanding expressions.If you or someone you know has a serious problem understanding expressions then this book could be helpful, but I would worry that it is perhaps too comprehensive. Many of the phrases contained within seem a bit obscure or archaic. If you did start using the phrases in here the chances are that no one would be able to understand you!Nice idea though."
2,"Great idea, but...","this is a great idea, but the author mixes American, English, and Australian expressions. Do you want your American aspie child to start using Australian expressions? Because you know they will, if they read them. Why couldn't the publisher have spent a few extra bucks and made a separate edition for each country?"

5,I love this book!,"This book is simply amazing! Once I pick it up, I can't put it down! I use it all the time on trips and parties. Everybody loves it!"
3,Notebooks of a Different Color,"Songs From Before is similar to the Blue Notebooks, without being duplicative. But, while there is plenty of good stuff here, the quality is not as consistently high.The speaking voice on this album detracts from the music.Tilda's voice on The Blue Notebooks worked great.But Wyatt's voice here does not.I think it's largely a matter of the low frequencies of Wyatt's voice interfering with the music. And the music interfering with the voice.But, also, the music that accompanies the speaking voice here is not as successful as on The Blue Notebooks.Most of the tracks that don't have Wyatt's voice, however, are super.3 1/2 stars"
5,EXCELLENT,this die grinder is great!!! More power than I expected. easy to use just what I needed to finish my restoration project.
3,Just OK,"The first song volume is lower than the rest, so I have to turn it up, and then other songs down. Needs better producing."
5,Mancini Effect?,This was one of three Mancini albums I had on LP that I loved to listen to while doing homework in high school. It's great. I'm thrilled to find it on CD. By the way I graduated 17th out of 500 students. Maybe it's a Mancini Effect
5,He's The Greatest,"There might be one or two songs that Mancini has done that I wouldn't care for but his artistry is next to none. He makes beautiful music, and it's VERY good for the soul."
4,cell equipment,"This product meets my approval with materials used. Its goodquality and serves my purpose, I have ordered others and foundit to be poor materials used will make it to the trash quick. Thanks [...]"
1,Don't waste your money,Bought this book and many other trading related books that are reads well but is cannot be translated to successful trading.
4,Cuter than the other crocs,"I have never owned a pair of crocs before because the other types were ugly as sin. My sister had a pair of the ballerina crocs, and she loved them. These crocs are pretty comfortable, very squishy and soft. They do rub a little on the top of my feet as they are a little small (I wear a 10, these shoes are a little tight.) My sister said that they will stretch out, though mine haven't yet."
3,need a half size,"these were great for vacation...walking through the dirty streets of hong kong and beijing. i would love for crocs to carry a half size, though. they were a tiny bit big and made for a blister the first day or so."
3,only okay,"I was expecting a great comfy shoe. However, your foot only sits about half-way into the shoe. When you look at the shoe, you assume your foot will be much closer to the ground. The sole of the shoe is much thicker than you would guess. I understand that is better for cushion and comfort; however, due to the short amount of shoe that actually covers your heel, your foot will not stay inside the shoe. I feel as though I am trying to keep my shoes on, and the shoe loses its comfy feel. When I walk, I feel as though I have flip flops on, and my heel rubs the back of the shoe."
3,Round up sizes!,"I WOULD absolutely love these shoes...if the sizes were better. Normally I wear a half size, and because of numerous other reviews, I got the impression to round down instead of up. Mistake. These shoes have a low back, so they fit everywhere else in the shoe, but have a tendency to slide off the back. I am assuming they are meant to be worn a little loose. Other than that they are great! Whatever the material is that they are made of is great at repeling odor too; they smell as fresh as the day I got them!"
2,big disappointment,"I love ballet flats, i love my regular ugly crocs, but this hybrid just didn't work. I haven't tried putting them in the tumble dryer yet to soften them up to mold to your foot, as suggested in other reviews, but honestly it is like an ill fitting Barbie shoe, it just kinda hangs on to the tips of your toes and dosent come up high enough on the heel to stay on at all. Since they are impossible to wear for any length of time, i can't be sure but I imagine your feet would be very sweaty in a short time."
4,Comfy and Versatile,"I bought these for my wife, and she loves them. They are very comfortable, yet fashionable. The good thing is that you don't have to worry about them getting dirty or wet, since they are so easy to clean. You can wear them almost anywhere. They are a bit loud at times as they make a squishing sound when you walk."
5,Great Kid Shoe!,This is my thirteen year old daughter's second pair of black Primas. She loves the look and feel of them as they have air vents in the back as well as on top.I love them because they don't get all smelly like other flats and they look nice. She wears them to school AND she wears them when we go out to places that are a little more than casual but not too fancy.This shoe is a win win for kids and adults.
2,Who Designed THis Shoe?,"It was one of the most strangely and uncomfortably configured shoes I have ever put on my feet, and I ordinarily like crocs. I was disappointed, because looking at it it looked like it would be the perfect shoe - comfortable as a croc, yet more stylish. Alas, I was mistaken"
2,Seriously bummed...,I have never worn the original crocs but I have the malindi's and adore them!! I bought these thinking they would be just as comfortable and I was severely disappointed!I wear a 7.5 to a small 8 and have medium width feet and these shoes are SO narrow!! Now I have only had them on for a few hours and it DOES take a while for the croslite material to heat up and start conforming to your feet so I am hoping that they stretch just enough. I will say that heel is VERY low so it kind of feels like your foot isnt in the shoe all of the way... the jury is out but I am pretty sure that I will be buying a new pair of Malindi's.
3,Sweaty and Small,"I really liked these shoes when i first got them. They fit decently (a little tight) and i didn't have any of the trouble the other reviewers had with them staying on my feet. However, i went to the lake one day and left them sitting by the pool in the sun and they haven't fit right since. I can still technically get my feet into them, but they are severely uncomfortable. They create pressure on the tops of my toes and the side of my foot. It didn't occur to me that sitting in the sun could get them too hot and reshape them but perhaps it should have. In any case, they are useless to me now. If that were my only issue i would probably give this shoe 4 stars because they were nice me to begin with. However, the combination of tiny vent holes and a tight fit make for a sweaty foot. If i got them again i would get a size larger and keep them out of the sun."
4,crocs,very comfortable i wear a 6 1/2 so i ordered a 7 and it was too big i had to sent it back to get a six (no half sizes) but the 6 fits perfectly!
2,"""Pearl White"" is NOT white","I ordered the color ""pearl white"" in the hopes that I could wear them as a comfy alternative with my wedding dress, however the color is more of an aluminum/grey color and NOT white at all. I'm very disappointed."
2,bad color,"They were kind of big and they are not pearl at all, they are gray. just light dirty looking gray."
3,croc ballet,"They are very very comfortable, but; they are NOT white! I was hoping that they would be more white, but they are actually kind of gray. And the size was a bit off too."
1,BLISTERS!!!,"I have two pair of the shoes unfortunately and my review is as follows...BLISTERS, BLISTERS, BLISTERS. I just wore these to the ball game and was forced to pay 30 bucks for a pair of St. Louis Cardinals flip flops just so I could WALK. I walked from the parking garage about one block to the stadium and already I could feel them forming...as we located our seats, they were already popped and I couldn't walk.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,"Looks fine, doesnt fit me",Try this on in a store. I ordered online and it is not comfortable. Runs more narrow. I won't try any Croc flats after this fiasco. Not adjustable.Think it is great for a 9B or 9M.I'm a wide and I did not like it.Still love crocs...
1,Wish I would have read reviews.,"This shoe is probably one of the worst shoes I've ever tried. It does not fit well, it constantly comes off your heel (like other reviewers stated), and is generally uncomfortable. I'm selling mine."
2,Crocs blister machine,"This shoe is very cute, but has a major design flaw. It sits on low on the back of the foot and has a ridge which leads to MAJOR blisters. They are good if you're willing to buy blister pads and toughen up the backs of your feet. On the upside, they are perfect for wet days and you won't look like a typical tourist in crocs and a fanny pack."
2,Really wanted to like these shoes,"I have been wearing these shoes all day, and while I do not have any blisters, THEY WILL NOT STAY ON MY FEET. I keep tripping trying to stay in them. I really really wanted to like these shoes. I even tired the trick where you put them in the dryer so they mold to your feet a bit, it only shrunk them. I'm glad they were only 14 dollars, because i wasted my money.On the other hand, AMAZON is amazing and had them shipped only a few hours after I ordered them and they were delivered to my door two days earlier than expected! Wonderful!!! Love Amazon!!"
2,Meh,"I adore Croc brand footware and was excited when I purchsed these. I was soon disappointed though because #1) the color (red) was very dull and had an orangeish hue to it, and #2) they squeaked really bad when I walked. They really looked like ""garden shoes"" no matter what I wore then with. I wore then 3-4 times in the hopes that my feelings toward them would improve, but they never did so eventually I sold them in a garage sale."
3,Comfy shoe,"Shoe was comfortable, but ran big. It's a little built up in the heel, compared to other crocs. This takes some getting used to, but once you do it's really comfortable. I wear a size 8, but a size 7 would have fit perfectly in this style."
3,Briggs/Pressure Washers/Project Guide,This book was over priced. It deals strictly with Brigg&Stratton equipment and was of little use to me as I had bought an electric washer. It's fine for B&S owners but not much good otherwise.
4,"Simple, yet great introduction","Provides a very good simple introduction on what the pressure washer is, and how to use it in various cleaning projects."
3,hmmm...interesting indeed,"This is a great band, but there is room for improvement. It takes a few listens to distinguish the difference between the songs and the incoherant screams in between guitar riffs don't help much. I see better things coming in the future."
5,Really Cute!,What a great little shirt! Know that the sizes run just a bit small (important with 100% cotton).
4,Grupo Batuque - Rhythmix: Reluque Batuque,"Grupo Batuque gets the once over on Rhythmix: Reluque Batuque, with a host of electronic musicians taking their primal rhythms and reworking them. Thus, Osunlade gives ""Na Batida Do Agogo"" a smooth and deep house rub, while Big Bang gives ""Read Between the Lines"" a slightly harder mix. 4 Hero puts the breaks on ""The Samba,"" while Zero dB does the same with his Carnaval-crazy mix of ""E Ruim."" Fauna Flash and Viper Squad both produce more aggressive tracks, while Jamie Anderson delivers a tech-house remix of ""Do Anything."" Sadly, Masters at Work and Da Lata put in some atypically lackluster mixes, but the rest of the crew manage to keep things exciting."
5,GREAT STUFF,"I LOVE THIS STUFF WOULDNT GO WITHOUT IT. I LOVE THE SMELL, IS MILD FOR ALL KIDS, I USE IT ON KIDS FEETS, ARMPITS BACK AND CHEST AND IT WORKS GREAT"
2,Don't bother,"While the Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours) is a great addition to daily prayer, this version lacks any way to find your way into the proper readings for the day according to the scheduled of the Church. More work needs to be done on this before it is ever offered to the public."
1,I agree with the other reviewers,"This is poorly formatted, I think the text could be good but it is impossible to navigate on the kindle"
2,No hyper/cross-reference capabilites,"The Kindle volume suffers from a lack of internal linkages. The only way to to use it as a breviary is to set extensive bookmarks -- a tedious, at best, method which does not facilitate ease of use."
2,Good for historical perspective,This is only of interest to those with a passion for Church history and liturgy. It does not directly apply to the beautiful liturgy of the hours we presently use.
1,Not what it says it is,"Not what it is titled this is not The Divine Office, this is a prayer book and I would think that is"
3,Lack of bass & treble controls spoils it,"Lack of bass & treble controls spoils it, bass not that great as expected or talked about in other reviews."
1,Defective item,"When i set up the speakers -- I immediately noticed continuous hissing noise from the right speaker. I swapped the cable -- changed where to take powers -- hissing noises never go away.I checked the knowledge base of m-audio but there were no similar report, and their customer support is non-responsive. I am returning it to amazon today. It has decent sound quality, but with defective right speaker, it is not really fun to listen to."
1,Reverse Psychology!,"To all people like me wondering ""What's up with the crackling?"", it's just the wire. Get a new connection to the AUX input and you're good to go. And don't complain about buying it, you paid for speakers, not connections.These things are AWESOME! BEAUTIFUL MUSIC!"
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"It has been approximately two and a half days since I received the M-Audio AV40 monitors for Christmas. Without turning the volume up even HALFWAY, the left channel monitor has already blown. These are terrible monitors, STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!! Anyway looking for real stereo mixing monitors...stay away from these, they are just ""high tech computer speakers"" and aren't worth a dime. I will be contacting Amazon tomorrow for my refund."
3,Pops and snaps,I'm using these with a Macbook and get a variety of pops and snaps through the speakers from such things as switching on or off a small incandescent light on my table or the washing machine starting or stopping downstairs. I have it plugged into an APC filter/BBU so I would not expect any interference through the AC line. These replaced an old speaker set with subwoofer that came from Dell years ago - they did not have this problem.
4,"great reference monitors, bad stock cables","The AV40 work great, but you'll want to get new cables, or use your own. Both the line-in and RCA to 3.5mm cables have tips that are slightly smaller than normal, and some devices will not properly connect to the right channel. This will cause it to fade out, cut out or not produce sounds at all from the right channel. After switching out cables, they work great."
4,Good 2 Channel Setup,"These speakers sound pretty good for a 2 channel setup. Mid-range is a little flat, low end is fair considering they only have 4"" drivers. Overall, they're a pretty good value. For a step-up on 2 channel speakers, the Audioengine A5s are nicer but are about twice the cost.I noticed you can leave them powered on and as long as they're not receiving a signal, the onboard amp doesn't power up, it drew <1W at the wall when powered but without a signal."
5,Fantastic sound,"Bought a pair of these when the old 5.1 Logitech set started to develop cracking noises. Absent a sub, these are a bit light on bass but I don't play many games anymore, so I don't miss that at all. For music, sound is loud, clear and crisp. Definitely recommending these to all my friends."
3,"Nice, but don't expect much bass","After reading multiple reviews of computer speakers, I decided to try these. While they look nice and have an enjoyable upper and mid-range, the bass is definitely insufficient. They would need a subwoofer to bring out the really deep bass notes. One of my test songs for evaluating speakers is Led Zeppelin's ""That's the Way"" (from Led Zeppelin III) because of the rich, deep bass line which is introduced at about 4:45. These speakers were unable to register that the first few notes ever occurred. In the end, I decided I didn't like them, and returned them."
3,Not a pro solution.,"I'm by no means a 'true' audiophile, but I am a music producer that knows how to use monitors in my workflow.Let me make this clear. These WILL make your music sound good. Real good... As a producer, that's a problem. I use monitors to hear the 'flat' sound and use them as a tool to help me 'fill it up'. These 'pre-fill'. Makes them an excellent choice for consumers listening to already mixed music. Not for pro mixing.Great computer speakers! Not great reference monitors."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I was excited to get a pair of these for their small size and reputation for good sound. However, as soon as I hooked them up, I found that the passive speaker didn't work at all. Also, the 1/8"" input jack is apparently very low quality - the provided cable doesn't seat well, and the connection is fragile and intermittent.A quick look at the m-audio user forums showed more than 20 posts in the last 6 months of users describing the exact same or similar issues (one or both speakers not working at all, uneven volume, static or hum from one or both speakers). Many of these issues occurring right out of the box as they did for me.They sure like to tout these as ""professional"" speakers, but perhaps they should get in the habit of putting that word in ironic quotes. Sure these speakers are inexpensive, and I was hoping they would sound very good for the price, but even inexpensive gear can be well-built, reliable, and durable. I would call these speakers just plain cheap."
4,Nice speakers,Nice pair of powered speakers. Great sound for the money. I keep these in our master bedroom and have them hooked up to an AirPort Express for iTunes. I only wish they came with a remote of some type to control the volume/power from a distance.
3,Very good .... compared to what?,"This product is a solid performer as you might expect coming from M-Audio. Keep your expectations in line with what the product is.... it's not audiophile quality. They are book shelf powered speakers that deliver pleasant, smooth sound with no real low end, not remarkably great stereo imaging but not fatiguing on your ears and fairly flat across most of the audio spectrum. This product is much better that what is commonly sold as computer speakers.I reserve superlatives such as great and exceptional for only the very best. These speakers are good where most ""computer audio speakers"" systems are awful."
1,"Great sound quality, terrible build quality","These speakers sound fantastic. For the first few months I had them, I considered them worth every penny.Unfortunately, mine died shortly after that. Within the past year, M-Audio has picked up a reputation for terrible build quality. Judging from the M-Audio user forums, the most frequent problem with these speakers is a big imbalance in volume between the left and the right speakers.If you're in the market for a pair of speakers or studio monitors, save yourself the trouble and just look elsewhere, at least until M-Audio cleans up their act. There's no point in gambling $150 on these speakers."
5,Awesome sound,"One of the best speakers I've owned.A little pricey, but totally worth it.The life like sound experience provided by these speakers is unbeatable.Creative,JBL,Logitech speakers don't even come close.Go for these monitors."
3,Adequate for the money.,"These speakers sound pretty good in a small room. Was a bit saddened that they put the power switch behind the speaker amidst the other connecions. Also, to have flimsy bare wire speaker connections instead of standard RCA connectors was a real bummer. One auxilliary input and headphone jack in the front of one speaker are a real plus though. Relatively lightweight and 20 watts per channel make this a decent purchase. If however, you are the neighborhood DJ, best to leave these home unless playing a very, very small venue."
1,"Common Problem, Buzzing sound.","It worked great, but after a year it created a buzzing sound. I researched this, and this problem is very common with this model av40. Company should have recalled it. If you are trying to search it in the internet it will pop up in google as one of the main problems. Maybe because this is made in china? China has low quality check control that will results to many lemon products.I work as IT support, so I tried to diagnosed a little by unplugging everything to make sure it was not the inputs. It is not, must be one of the diode or capacitor that over heated or went out. I went to the nearest Repair shop, and guy was saying it is the circuit board will charge me minimum $65.I rather buy a different brand of speakers. It was so sad, because I boast how great these speakers are.conclusion: Great speakers but mostlikely it wouldn't last. I wish I bought the logitech z-2300 instead."
3,"Too much Bass, not near a reference sound","I bought these based on the reviews and the excellent price. They have plenty of power but the sound is, as another reviewer said, too bass heavy. Either the product is not consistent, or many reviewers are way off. Since the name of these are ""Studiophile"" I would assume M-Audio is trying to get as close to a reference quality sound as possible. They are far, far from that. I will have to EQ these to get them right. I rate them overall a 3 because it is actually what I would expect for the price paid. I was just hoping it was a real steal based on the reviews."
3,Not as Advertised,"I have a pair of AV40s that I bought about three years ago. I love them so much I wanted a second pair for the office.After some research it became clear that the newer version, MKII, is inferior to the original - no bass boost, lower wattage, reduced connectivity, etc.The MKII version is selling in the low $100s while the original sells at closer to $200. No problem I thought - I want the newer version and I'm willing to pay for it.The problem is, none of the sellers on Amazon have the older version. After attempting to order through three vendors, paying the higher price, I received MKIIs.I ended up finding the true original version elsewhere. Do your research if you really want the older version.If you don't care, buy the MKII at nearly $100 less."
2,Where did the sound go?,"I was very happy with these speakers for the first 2 years. They've recently just started fading out after about 5-10 minutes of play regardless of what device I'm using to play music. I currently have my iPod cranked up and the speaker volume at above half and I can barely hear the music. If I turn them off and on again, they work for about a minute and then fade out again. Based on what others have said, I'm not hopeful that M-Audio will repair this blatant defect in manufacturing, so I'll check locally to see if anyone here knows how to diagnose and repair the issue. Otherwise, I'll be moving to a new product. M-Audio, you've disappointed me - speakers that are treated well should not die so young."
5,Nice but pricey,These are nice but for the price I was not overly blown away. I think there are cheap speakers with large drivers available at some of the large computer stores for about 1/2 the price.
2,M-Audio Studiophile AV 40 Powered Speakers,"I purchased a pair of M-Audio Studiophile AV 40 Powered Speakers last week and I am not overly impressed. The sound is ok but you cannot use a lot of bass without getting an annoying hum. They are not as good as my Bose PC speakers, that's for sure."
5,"Buy them, you will not be sorry.","Great value for the price. You can even use them for your entertainment system if you do not have a cavernous living room. Sound, at all levels is great. You will be surprise at the great quality of the highs, the midrange and the lows. Here's one other benefit... they fit nicely into a roll-a-board suitcase... take them with you for great sound with your iPod/Phone/Pad on vacation!"
2,Oh no....,"just hooked these up and the crackle is getting worse and worse, very upsetting. update soon. They sounded great out of the box though but they havn't lasted an hour."
5,Good all round portable solution for you mobile guys,"Powerful enough to entertain a party at home or in a small home studio, reliable enough to do your productions as an itinerant producer, this is a fine set of affordable speakers that just plainly do exactly what they're supposed to!"
1,ultra cheap cables ruin all possibility of a good impression,"glad to see that speakers are well reviewed. i was convinced to purchase them.the 3.5mm to RCA cable they come with is a joke. not shielded at all. speakers go nuts when i even touch the cable by accident which is kind of hard to do given this cable is like 3 feet long (you guys serious?).so i suppose i will have to buy a real shielded cable to actually use these. not a big deal? nah. it IS a big deal.gonna try to call M-Audio and give them a piece of my mind.pro tip: include $2 6-foot shielded cable with your ""pro"" product."
4,Great set of speakers,Purchased these on both written and personal product reviews and I've not been disappointed at all.Great monitor speaker sound.
5,Excellent Speakers,"I read all the reviews I could find on these speakers, and had to buy them without hearing them...it's hard not to be impressed with almost everyone giving them five stars, website after website. I was not disappointed. These are really great speakers for my use, which is just listening at my computer in a medium sized room. I've been going though my my whole digital audio library, and music in every genre is much more alive, crisp and full than I've been hearing it on our bigger system, headphones, you name it. Serious listeners who have invested a lot of money on equipment have probably experienced this level of audio for a while, but as a more casual listener I'm thrilled I can be included among them for $150. Audiophiles out there --I'm beginning to appreciate your obsession!"
1,"Sound fine, but quality is a big problem","When the speakers worked, I thought they sounded fine. They aren't so expensive and I didn't expect audiophile sound quality.Ever since I bought the speakers, the volume control would crackle a bit. It's been about a year and a half and now the powered speaker is messed up. I have to turn the volume all the way up (on the speaker's control) to get even a little sound out of it. As other reviewers have stated, it's not worth it to send the speakers back to M Audio. When I tried their customer support, all I got was automated messages on the phone and could never speak to a real person. I did get e-mail help, but that is such a pain in the butt. Sending the speakers in will cost you too much in both shipping and repair fees.If I'd have known that these speakers were the disposable type, I wouldn't have bought them."
1,product broke after one week,I left the speakers on and after a week they no longer worked. The back of one speaker felt like it was going to catch on fire.I had to sent them back to the m audio for repair.
1,Again with the Hum,"Was very pleased with these for the first 6 months, then they suddenly developed a loud hum. This persists even when all inputs are unplugged. Have also tried multiple outlets. This is unacceptable, and is clearly a defect related to the speakers themselves. I will not purchase M-audio products again. Do not buy these under any circumstances, as it sounds like this is a common problem which has not been addressed."
4,Very good sounding speakers.,"They replaced my JBL 'Creature' set that started to 'buzz' on most tunes. This pair sounds very clean, can handle most of my music with little distortion and like most good speakers(and fine wine?) sounds better after it's break-in period. Bass could be better even with the bass-enhancement switch is on and the on-off switch could be placed better...like in front! These are MUCH bigger than the tiny speakers from the JBL Creatures and you need a subwoofer for a deeper floor-thumping bass."
2,A lot of defective speaker since mid-2009,"At first, i was looking to buy Bose Companion speakers for my PC, but after reading a lot of review i went for the AV-40. I received them last week and they did sound awesome. But after 5 days of light use, the left channel stop working. I went to the AVID website forum and i found out that the vast majority of buyer since mid 2009 have the exact same problem and were having trouble getting a working pair.Some had to pay like 40$ in shipping 5 times before they give up and went to another brand. I will try to repair them myself and if i can't, i will assume the lost. I will never buy any product from that company again. I really wonder if all of those positive comment on different website are really from customers. It look like the company is trying to make publicity by posting false review."
1,Died after one year.,"I've had these just over a year. I noticed that if you leave them on for more than a couple of hours, the amped speaker gets dangerously hot. So, I turn them off when not in use. A few weeks ago, they started crackling a lot and the right speaker sometimes would go out. Reseting the power fixed the issue for a while. Now the right speaker does not work at all for all inputs. Both headphone channels work, so the issue is in the amp. For $100+ speakers, this sucks. If you need monitors, go with a better product. If you just want some good computer speakers because you're an audiophile, these will initially impress, then disappoint. Now I have to spend another $100+ on something else."
5,Pleasantly surprised,The sound reproduction of the AV 40 speakers exceed my expectations. Installation is straight forward. Highly recommend them for computer users.
5,Nice,"I bought these several months ago to replace some really ancient and not especially good Altec-Lansings. Frankly, I picked these because they were on sale rather than as a result of extensive research, but they're nice looking and my initial impression was favorable. However, since then, every time I start listening to something on them I find myself smiling, because they just sound so pleasant. For my use at least, the clarity is excellent and the balance good. Well worth the money and trouble-free so far."
3,Don't mix with these speakers,"These are good playback speakers, BUT DO NOT MIX WITH THEM.I purchased these 11 months ago, and I was pretty happy with them until I listened to my mixes on my home and car speakers. The AV 40s don't not give you an honest representation of your mix.If you're looking for home studio monitors spend the extra cash and get Yamahas. The Yamahas will cost you more, but they will serve their purpose."
1,second pair (after sending back first) is junk too,"These speakers sound really good, but the right speaker cuts out after they have been turned on for about thirty minutes. I think it must be a heat issue. The back of the powered speaker gets really hot. If you turn the power off and back on, SOMETIMES the right speaker starts working again. Sometimes it doesn't. I sent back the first pair for ""repair"" (at my shipping cost)and they just sent me a new pair, and the same problem started happening almost immediately. At this point I'm fed up with this company. Don't take your chances on these faulty speakers."
1,Brand New and Crackling,Hmm - very disappointed with these speakers - I installed the speakers as per the manual and switched and heard the crackling when music was being played - at I first thought it was my audio Card or some kind of electrical interferenceAfter removing all the possible causes I came to the conclusion - it was the speakers themselves.I did a Google and bob's your aunty plenty of reports complaints about cracklingWill be contacting Amazon for a refund
4,Great speakers,"these are great for music lovers! PLEASE NOTE!!!! THESE ARE NOT REFERENCE MONITORS! These are basically glorified computer speakers. if you are using them for studio recording i highly suggest getting the BX5 for beginners.however, i have used these for music and movies. the RCA inputs make it very connective for whatever you want to use them for! These get super loud with out distortion! definitely worth the buy for the money to be used for anything other than reference monitors!"
3,M-Audio AV-40 speakers,"I listen at low volume levels in an office environment. Adequate computer speakers. Smooth. Not much bottom end. Occupy a good bit of desktop space. Directional, but not extremely so. Better if you have room to point them directly at your listening position. If space is an issue and you have room under your desk, I'd go with a decent subwoofer system."
4,great speakers for price,These speakers are very good. For the price I paid here speakers are great. I used them as monitors for some music production - not bad at all. Sound is clear and warm.
5,Full strong sound. highly recommended.,Great speakers. Full strong sound. I especially appreciate the ability to replace cords if any become damaged. (I have a cat who enjoys chewing cords and ruining my electronics!)
2,Great at first but then BUZZ...,"Started out really well-- but within six months, started to develop a VERY ANNOYING BUZZ sound that needed multiple adjustments to the cable to fix. After a year, my right speaker went. Several weeks after that, the buzz became permanent. I would NOT recommend buying."
4,Good entry level monitor,"While I am sure there are better monitors out there, they are definately not in this price range. After reading several reviews, these appeared to be the best for the money, and I think they are. Great highs, nice lows. A good representation of music in my home studio."
4,Very impressive from close range,"HighsAs computer speakers and from close range these blew me away. The bass is tight, the vocals lifelike and the highs crystal clear.They're heavy, feel well built and look sleekFrom close range turn the volume not even halfway and it feels like a concertLowsThey lose some luster if you try to crank them up to fill up a big room. The bass gets a little muddy and the highs a little piercing.The footprint is on the large side.I get a slight popping noise when I turn on a nearby light."
4,Nice.,"These are on my desktop (big, old , and solid) hooked to a Mac Mini using the TRS cable (have to order that separately). Usually playing iTunes music (all ripped lossless), podcasts, and ""Handbraked"" movies. I leave the speaker mounted volume control about 5/8 of the way up and use the keyboard volume keys on the Mac to adjust. No extraneous noise coming from the speakers when just sitting with no input.Solidly built (molded?) but the terminals for the ""slave"" speaker are clip style (they don't accept banana plugs) and there are no inset screw threads or even keyholes for bracket mounting. I placed adhesive rubber pads on the bottom to keep them from ""buzzing"" the desktop and am using angled foam blocks to aim them up slightly. With that said these sound WAY better than the set of Altec Lansing ATP3 speakers these replaced. These can play incredibly load with no discernible distortion or ""blating"".Good value if you can snag a decent price (I got them on a Woot sale)."
5,WOW!,"I had low expectations of overall quality at high volume for these monitors, so i was more or less blown away after these things broke in and i turned 'em up. These things can JAM! I think ill buy another pair for the entertainment system...."
5,simply awesome,"Don't listen to the naysayers on this website. These speakers rock. I read one review that said the bass was not deep enough. Are you kidding me? I have yet to use the ""bass booster"" option and think it's plenty. Money well spent in my opinion. Go ahead, make the purchase :)"
4,good sound great price,"I did not expect such a well built product for the modest amount that I payed for the speakers. They were very well assembled, heavy and quite attractive. It took about 10 minutes to hook them up to a cable box to improve the sound of a small lcd tv. The sound was very rich and full, unlike the tinny effect from the tv speakers. I would highly recommend these M-Audio speakers to anyone hoping for improved sound out of their tv"
5,"Great sound, small package.","These speakers perform very well. I have mine on my desktop. I needed a set of speakers that did not take up my whole desk or need to be wired around the room. I enjoy playing online games and listening to music, and am impressed with the sound quality. Plenty of bass without having a huge subwoofer under my feet."
5,Excellent!,"When I looked for speakers, I discovered that speakers seemed to be a beauty-in-the-eyes-of-the-beholder thing. For lots of speaker systems, lots of people liked them, but there were also people that disliked them (or worse).These speakers seemed to be a cut above in the reviews, so I decided to go for them despite their price.I love them!I use them on my desk, so I don't use them at very high volumes, but I occasionally do crank them up. They're great low; they're great loud. You can just FEEL the craftsmanship!I highly recommend them."
5,Crisp Clear Sound!,Bought these originally for a TV in my kitchen. Turns out they were a little too big for the counter space so I switched them out for the speakers on my computer. They sound great for both music and gaming. They are truly studio monitor quality and can be listened to at very close range. If you are limited for space perhaps look for something smaller but if you need perfect clean sound reproduction with a good power boost these speakers are definitely worth the cost!
3,Great while it lasts,"Let me start by saying this set of monitors are probably one of the best computer monitors you could get for the price. The bass was decent, considering that it doesn't come with a dedicated woofer. It's perfect for casual music listening.But after using it for more than 1 year, these speakers started dying. After reading all the reviews stating the poor customer service, I guess I won't even try to get any support from them. Overall, great while it lasts. Avoid them if you expect your speakers to last a few years."
1,terrible support,"i bought these new nov29th 2010. put them away since then as i was purchasing everything i needed to build a new computer. {amd chip was on b/o for a lng time} finally i plugs these in 2 weeks ago for the first time and they worked well. now my right speaker doesnt work... tried everything .. let me say this, i called maudio thinking they may do something since i only used them for 2 weeks. no tips, no advice, just pay the shipping to them, 40.00 an hour labour charge and pay the shipping back. nice service and support. if you buy them and you dont have a problem great but if you do you`l be out of luck. i wouldnt recommend these to anyone."
4,pretty good speakers,I bought these speakers and I am pretty pleased with them. For the money they get pretty loud and bump my room. I would recommend these for anyone with a limited budget trying to get some good quality sounds.
2,Not sure if I received a bad product,"I was excited about this speakers based on the reviews online, but when I set them up I was hearing a buzzing noise from the main speaker (the one which had all the controls). I couldn't take it. So I returned the speakers. I can not comment if the item was defective or this is a known issue"
2,not good enough for monitors,"Having read several positive reviews of these M-Audio AV 40 speakers, I decided to get them for low volume quality sound listening from both vinyl and digital sources. The sound is plasticky and poor quality, and not as good quality sound as creative gigaworks which I found surprising. They also had dodgy electrical connections. The Gigaworks design has a bass port pointing up, instead of out the rear, which is an advantage both for sound balance and when there is little room, which is probably the usual scenario for this type of product. In my experience to get proper sound better than gigaworks you need to spend more like $400.CR ProvidenceM-Audio Studiophile AV 40 Powered Speakers][[ASIN:B001RNOHDU Creative GigaWorks T20 Series II 2.0 Multimedia Speaker System with BasXPort Technology"
4,"Good speakers, but large","The sound quality is superb and the bass is amazing for speakers this size. However, I wouldn' really consider them as PC speakers unless you have some room. These boxes are bigger than most and they require presence."
4,Kinda Large; Surprising Bass,"I have a large mp3 library & wanted good speakers. Was leaning toward the Logitech Z-2300 with THX certification but just don't have the floor space for the large subwoofer. I've had the M-Audio Studiophile AV 40s about a month and really like them. They have great frequency range (for my listening anyway) and I was totally surprised at the bass (even without using the bass-boost control). I've been surprised at hearing clear upper notes and bongo drums on another song that I don't remember hearing before. ONLY drawback is that they are kind of large for desktop speakers, but I wouldn't exchange them because of the great sound."
1,Connection problem,I bought these speakers and the connection to any of my players is awful. It crackles and I have to gingerly place the wire or it stops working. Defective product.
1,Speakers defective,"I got these speakers brand new and they were defective. As soon as I plugged them into my laptop, they played static and anything I tried to play through them just got cut out. Sometimes moving the cord around would allow me to get them to sound decent, but if I by any chance hit the cord or needed to move my laptop at all, the static would instantly return. There's simply no excuse for this."
5,remarkable,"These are the best computer speakers I've heard. I like them much better than than Harman Kardons they replaced. And they're pretty close to true reference monitors at three times the price. True, they are lighter in the bass end than units with subs, and some people won't like that. But they have a crisp, flat but rich sound. And I do trust them for mixing audio projects for video.How can they be both flat and rich? Let me use a visual metaphor. Imagine sitting in your home looking out the window to your favorite view of the world outside, at say 1/2 an hour before sunset. It's gorgeous, right? Now remove the window. How much more richness and beauty do you see?For me, this is what good speakers should do: reproduce the original without adding their own coloring, distortions, or filters. And when they do that one can hear how rich (or not) the original is. These AV-40s do that, at a very cheap price point. I'm completely impressed."
2,"Love M-Audio, but this product is flawed","The sound quality from these speakers was very very good, a bit ""punchy"" in the lower mid range, but overall pretty balenced.The main flaw was an incessent hum in the right-hand channel. We returned the first set with this issue, exchanged for a second set, and the second set had exactly the same problem. No... it was not a ground loop issue, as it continued even with nothing hooked up to the input.That being said, I am still a fan of M-Audio. I have a set of their Studiophile MX5's at home and LOVE THEM. It seems that their initial batch of these speakers are suffering from a manufacturing defect."
4,DeWalt DW891 a Definate Winner,Works Great I have had one of these shears for at least 6 years now and it works great! The only problem that I have had with it is when turning a corner on a roof curb 14 - 16 gauge steel I have snapped the center blade twice. (so now I keep a spare set of blades with it) *Note these blade don't come cheap! (If I was not so lazy I would precut the corners with a Sawzall)
2,Beware of the Kindle edition!,"First of all let me stress that I have this book in hardcopy as well - and I absolutely love it!This was also the reason that I picked this eBook as one of the first I purchased for my new Kindle 2. I did not check the preview before purchasing... that was a big mistake.The eBook edition is just not done right. All Thai letters are included as bitmap images. (If you look carefully in the ""Product Detail"" above, you will see it weights in with a whopping 20070 KB)Although it must have taken forever to do this way, it just does not work for the reader. The quality of the graphic characters is really terrible and besides it makes this otherwise slender book take a HUGE chunk of your Kindle memory.Am I missing something here? I thought the Kindle would be able to display Unicode characters...Can I return an eBook?"
5,Move ahead in Thai Language,"This is more than just a grammar book. In addition to providing understanding of how to string Thai words into meaningful sentences, I get such a fine flavor of Thai culture as it is woven into the selected word/phrase usage etc. An essential guide for anyone who wants to advance beyond typical tourist phrase book Thai. I combined this book with a good Thai-English dictionary and a good English-Thai dictionary, and I now have what I need to effectively write and converse in Thai. This has been a godsend for me as a do-it-yourself Thai language learner. Bravo to David Smith. The only thing I'd change in the book is that I'd feature Thai script before the transliteration. That would help with the reading since I wouldn't first see the transliterations. But hey, it's a great book anyway."
2,The Sex Pistols,Sex PistolsThe recording is rough but ok if your a Sex Pistols fan. The packaging is far greater than the quality of the CD inside. Recommended for the experienced ear of a true Sex Pistols fan.
3,It sure wasn't what we were looking for.,"We used this book as the textbook for a course on Classical Mechanics at Trinity Western University. The actual book was decent, but there were only about 6 practice questions (on average) for each of the 5 chapters. My professor had to resort to giving us supplementary material so we could cover all of the material of a University-level Mechanics class. The book was okay, but it could have used some work."
2,Leaves stuff rough and chalky,"Since I like the other Kilz primer products, I thought I would give this a try. Awful stuff, leaves chalky and very rough surface. Drys nicely though."
4,happy,"Works well with the steel, but across the corrugated part not so well, maybe its the guy who's running the shears. Seems to be built well. Im glad I got it.Moeller from Nebr."
2,Don't Bother,"The table came in a lot of small pieces and the ""instruction sheet"" was nothing but a complicated picture and no written instructions which made it difficult to assemble even though I am mechanically inclined and usually don't have these problems.The table itself, once completed, only delivers traction via one's chin. The two ""lumps"" in the table on either side of one's neck that are supposed to provide the cervical part of the traction are useless. The main pressure is all on the mouth and jaw which makes it very uncomfortable and ineffective for appropriately balanced neck traction.This item will be going back to the seller and I would not recommend this to anyone I know."
4,Good,Great movie about finding your faith and holding true to it. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that all the characters have an accent and it was hard to understand them sometimes.
3,good message,"The movie message was a good one. Story line was a little slow, actors were ok. Seems like it was edited and some parts of the story was left out, or time passed an an artificial rate or something."
5,Great faith builder,This had some funny parts in it as well and the characters were great in it. Very much enjoyed the movie. Although as with many faith based stories there is a heart-wrencher in there.
4,Great Message,"This movie has a great message of patience, obedience, and faith in an awesome unfailing God. Great family movie."
2,Non-Christians Need Not Apply,"At first, this movie seemed like it would be an interesting look into a culture we rarely get a glimpse at. It deals with white farmers, their interactions with the local African communities, and the awkward juxtaposition of two very different ways of life. However, it soon becomes apparent that this is not meant to be some sort of educational film. When the first ""miracle"" occurred my reaction was one of utter dismay. I mean, what, this guy thinks he's channeling God because it rained? Come on.The strong religious overtones basically killed the movie for me, and it wasn't exactly an action-packed film to begin with. After the second miracle I realized that I had no desire to continue to sit through the movie and endure something so patently silly, and I stopped watching it.You might like this movie if you're of a Christian persuasion, but if you're not, you're going to be spending a good chunk of the movie sighing and rolling your eyes."
2,Trust God with a faith of a child,Children believe anthing we tell them. We are God's children and so we have to believe what God tells us in the Bible. Angus did and God came through for him. This movie encourages and inspires me to believe God at His Word. God truly does miracles.
5,Faith Like Potatoes movie,I love the movie and recomend this true story to everyone that wants to be uplifted.
1,Faith Like Potatoes,"Sorry, didn't like this one at all. Took too long to get into the storyline and some of it you had to figure out what they were talking about. Accents were hard to listen to. I guess that I should say that being a true story made it watchable, but it could have been better. It was a little long also. Pictures of the real people at the end of the film were interesting to see."
2,Disappointing,"I once again, took the bait on the enormous number of rave reviews on this film - only to find that I was set up for disappointment. I guess I expect alot out of a film that gets so many high reviews. The acting was pretty decent - but the story line seemed a bit 'artificial' to me. And at a certain point, I found myself asking - ""... is this about the Glory of God?... or about the glory of a MAN, who searched for God and found Him?..."" In the end - I became more convinced that this was about the glory (the works) of a man, and because of this - largely failed (in MY opinion) in it's goal of bringing viewers closer to our marvelous Lord. And I ASSUME that this was the purpose of the movie, right? It wasn't terrible - but it wasn't all that good, either. It felt like there was a bit of 'boasting' going on here. (We are saved by FAITH - not by WORKS) Sadly, I will not be keeping this in my dvd library."
2,TONTA!,Un film muy tonto solo comprensible por fanaticos. Pesima actuacion.Muy predecible. No tiene nada de original y la parte sangrienta esta muy sobrada (no fue necesaria).
5,Good faith in God's provision,"I liked this movie. The man showed good faith in God's provision when everyone was against him and what he knew God had told him. I liked how he stood on God's word. God has already provided for all of us; Philip. 4:19 ""God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus"". We all need to stand in faith on this and praise and thank Jesus for all our needs being met. Amen! :-)Thankyou, Louise S"
4,"Our Lord, the Great Redeemer!","I highly recommend this true story of how one man finally dealt with his anger and truly came to faith through laying down his pride and suffered pain and loss. My ""8"" & ""10"" year olds watched it with me, but I will caution - the tractor accident scene is a bit graphic and may be difficult for younger viewers. Surrender, redemption, committment and forgiveness are themes contained in this film. The DVD contains all the extras on the real family. A great Christian film. A must for your library."
5,"FAITH LIKE POTATOES, VIDEO","I AM WELL PLEASED WITH THE DEVIVERY TIME, THE GOOD CONDITION OF VIDEO AND PRICE."
5,Awesome,"This is an Awesome movie especially for those who have or seek a real relationship with Jesus Christ. It is a REAL life movie depicting the trials and tribulations a man and his family living in South Africa. If you watch this movie you MUST watch the added features which show the real man the movie is based upon and some real footage of his family, farm and ministry."
4,Certainly a rewarding way to spend the evening!,Uplifting and inspiring. They certainly kept their eyes heavenward in all their adversity- would pick more movies by this producer.
5,FAITH LIKE POTATOES,"WOW! MY HUSBAND AND I WATCHED IT TOGETHER AND LOVED THE REAL-NESS OF THE MAN AND THE LIFE HE LED. WE WERE TOUCHED AND ENERGIZED BY THE FAITH WE SAW BEING LIVED OUT IN AN AUTHENTIC AND IMPERFECT PERSON. EVERYONE HAS STRUGGLES, DOUBTS, AND FEARS AT TIMES, AND I THINK THIS FILM SPEAKS TO ALL OF THESE WITH HOPE AND STRENGTH. WE WILL WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN."
5,A good Christ Centered Movie,"At first, I wasn't sure it was ""Christ Centered"", but after a bit of time into it, it began showing through! This is a real good movie.Ed Dennis (MrEd)"
5,Very Encouraging and Inspiring,"I really enjoyed this movie/documentary. I am encouraged in my faith as I watched this family endure tragedy and hardship, and yet responding to God's promptings for their lives.We give this movie to our friends.mdv"
3,This was an ok movie,"Faith Like Potatoes was a good movie, but it was a slow movie. I have nothing bad to say, only that it was ok."
4,Inspirational,This movie is kind of a sleeper - and you are really awed by its intensity. We have actually purchased multiple copies for sharing with others.
5,"all-in-all a great movie, and a must see! A++","This movie didn't get the credit it deserves. I thought it was a great family film especially if you have Christine values. It was entertaining throughout, it was a pleasure to watch though it definitely could have been improved with perhaps some more attention focused on another supporting actor. That was pretty much its only shortcoming for me. I wouldn't mind watching this movie again, and I think its even worth purchasing. Opinions vary so watch it and post your own review!!"
5,Working Faith,This movie is wonderful and powerful. With faith like this you can move mountains. Will restore your faith in God.
3,okay but probably not worthing owning,It was a nice movie for the family. Watching it once is nice but it is not one we will keep in our movie library.
5,wow,This was a hard movie to get into at first however we loved the story. it is a great example of forgiveness.
5,Faith Like Potatoes is awesome!!!!,"Awesome testimony of the power of God and what He's able to do through us if we trust Him and activate not only faith like a mustard seed, but faith like potatoes. Wonderful! Powerful! Awesome and Encouraging!"
4,Faith Like Potatos,"I loved the general concept of the movie. I thought it had some ""sappy"" times though and found it hard to understand what was being said."
4,'Good' movie only because it got off the ground slowly,"The story was great, but it took awhile until it really 'kicked in'. The first third was slow and developmental, then once it established the players and the setting, it was off and running. I still recommend this movie."
1,Horrific graphic scene ruins it,"My young teen daughter borrowed this from our church library. When we returned it, I included a warning message. There is a horrific tractor accident - very bloody. Hospital scene is heart-wrenching, way past the point of clean entertainment! I would never recommend this movie unless the viewer doesn't mind gore. My daughter was traumatized."
5,WHERE THERE'S LOVE THERE'S HOPE,"FAITH LIKE POTATOES is a wonderful movie. It was inspirational and moving. Make sure to watch the documentary on Angua Buchan's story as well. It made me want to watch the movie all over, again.In watching this amazing story, I was quickly brought back to the exact moment I truly accepted Jesus into my heart, along with the trials and tribulations that can follow. So very true to life.Frank Rautenback did an amazing job at playing, Angus. I hope to see him in more movies in the future. Angus' story is a true inspiration, and a lesson we all should not just grasp but live out.Listen to your calling, and then dive in...no matter what."
5,Faith lIke Potatoes,Faith like Potatoes is so inspiring to see how ones man Faith touched the lives of so many people. It reminds us that we need to Trust and Wait on the Lord
3,review of walk on by,I like about half of the songs. Her most popular ones. Like Trains and Boats and Planes. The other half I wasn't too crazy about. If I did it again I wouldn't buy the whole album.
5,Dionne Warwick - Walk on By,It's a must have album with great songs and Ms. Warwick was great!! You cannot go wrong in puchasing this album. I am re-living this great music of the 60's and 70's. It's a winner!
1,Could be better,"I agree with the first reviewer. There are no songs from Machine Head, Deep Purple In Rock, or my personal favorite Burn. How could you make a millennium collection without songs from these albums?"
1,Where is the person that did this compilation???,"What is this???? I think that the main reason why this compilation bothers to the people is the title. THE MILLENNIUM COLLECTION??? It means is should stand for the material that made Deep Purple what it is. And this is not it. This should of been called ""DEEP PURPLE; BEST OF THE 80s"" maybe.If you wouldn't buy the albums DP recorded during the 80s, then this CD could be a cool choice. But please, millennuim collection? :-S It's a bad-intentionated cd made by the record company, so DON'T BUY IT. They are tricking you. Check Out for others compilations."
2,Quit screaming...,"-Listen, this collection was taken from the 1980s when Deep Purple was signed to Polydor, so Universal wouldn't have access to Purple's earlier Warner Bros albums. Licensing them would be too expensive for a budget CD like this, so everyone here seems to be barking up a wrong tree with all the negative reviews and all.That being said, there's nothing really wrong with this collection other than the fact that it's missing tunes like ""The Spanish Archer"" ""Mitzi Dupree"" and ""Mean Streak"". If I had one serious complaint it's that they could have put that on here and more.Even with only the three Mercury albums to work with, they still could've fleshed out the playing time to 75 minutes by including the tracks above and more.That's why I'm gonna rate it only 2 stars. NOT because some Warner Bros tunes like ""Smoke On The Water"" weren't included...-"
1,Not Aesthetically Pleasing,"In the thumbnail this poster looks really good, but in person it's terrible. To begin with, it's really grainy and the text sticks out really strange - also notice the fine print - this is Japanese not Korean. Plus there's a hideous white border around, which is especially big at the top and bottom. It doesn't look professional at all. It's probably the worse poster I've ever seen or imagined. I could do better if I took the image off line and printed it out myself."
1,Badly mastered sound,"Warning: This CD was not mastered to the highest standards.This is a review not of Shirley Temple but of the poor job done on the remastering. Shirley's voice here sounds muffled (too much filtering?) and there is a crackling sound in every song that rises and falls with the volume making for a thoroughly unpleasant experience. This does not sound like record surface noise which could be overlooked given the age of these recordings.With all the other listings for Temple's music I would recommend staying away from this CD. Unfortunately I can't recommend another yet, although the Flapper label has always given me good quality before.Hope this helps."
5,go cop this!!,i think this CD is tha best!! i've heard it an it gets me all hyped up. i ave it a 5 because if u dont have it then you SHOULD cop this before its too late!
2,Not the real game soundtrack,"I love the game ""Destroy All Humans"" and I love the original and appropriately retro score by Garry Schyman. This CD is NOT that score! Oh, there's a clip here and there of Schyman's excellent homage to 1950's sci-fi music, but it's been stomped on all over by already dated hip-hop beats. Why did they do this? If you loved the music so much that you wanted to purchase a CD of a soundtrack from a video game, then you want THE SOUNDTRACK. If you want a typical house music hip-hop CD then you'll probably look elsewhere anyway. Sure is a shame. Garry Schyman's score deserves a real soundtrack CD. The this would have been 0 stars if not for the few clips of Schyman's score."
3,"Description didn't mention Sateen, Which is what they are...",We searched every 100% cotton King sheet set that Amazon had to offer looking for a good deal on a set of sheets that was not Sateen. We decided on these and made the purchase. When they arrived they were sateen. Very disappointed. After washing them they are slightly rough.
4,Black Sabbath Rocks!!,"Great compilation of Sabbath classics! Ozzy's reign with the band was incredible. Ronnie James Dio is awesome as well, but where's ""Neon Knights"" from the album Heaven and Hell? This is one of the best post-Ozzy tracks by the band, and it's been left off.Also, in the description it names Sabbath as the greatest heavy metal band of all time? Come on ... Led Zeppelin is always seated at number one in heavy metal polls, with Sabbath in the second spot. Not too shabby, however, being noted in the same sentence as Led Zep ..."
2,not interesting,"not happy with this product at all. There's been too many black sabbath greatest hits albums with ozzy material. There is only like 4 out of 32 songs on this that are not ozzy. Since they included a couple i gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There hasn't been a greatest hits package that include all who have sang with sabbath. No Tony Martin material, only 2 Dio era and only one song off of Reborn. 1980-1995 Black sabbath is mostly forgotten on this album, don't see how true sabbath fans can be happy with this."
4,Warning: For Oz-era fans only,"Check the track listing before you buy. If you don't like the Oz era, skip this, else you may be disappointed. Could also be useful for the Oz-uninitiated to get into it."
1,"Beware of silly, unprofessional sellers","A couple days after I ordered it I received an email from the seller stating that 'he was unable to ship my item because he had to go out of town for a week'. What?!!Although my charge card was refunded, what a waste of time."
5,The Best Sabbath Compilation,"Starting with the first album and ending with Mob Rules this includes nearly all of the early Sabbath classics with Evil Woman, which was previously unreleasd in the US and even includes Zero The Hero from the Gillan period. Of all the compilations out ther this is the one that I always come back to. All these songs on 2 discs. Not perfect but better than the rest."
2,didn't last,I bought one of these in June. By October's end it stopped working. It was never dropped and was only used about 10 times. Warranty is only good for 90 days. I expected more from Memorex. Guess I need to buy extended warranties on everything.
1,What a lemon!,"I bought this cd player for my son. Within 3 weeks, it was broken. I brought it back to the store and exchanged it for another one. This time the cd player broke in 2 days! He was not rough with it and barely used it. Don't bother with this one. It's a waste of money. I expected more from Memorex."
4,"It's not OEM, but it works","After years of service, my gen3 iPod no longer held a charge. Even with the bad review, I figured I'd give it a shot. After all, some life is better than a bricked iPod. The kit came with some basic tools and instructions on how to install the battery. I found it to be a simple process - took less than five minutes to replace.Having had this for about six months now, I have not experienced the same issue that the other reviewer did. It still holds a charge as long as it did when I installed it. I don't think it holds as long as the original, but certainly getting a few hours or more (it gets recharged before it is drained most of the time).For the money, it was worth it to extend the life of an iPod rather than buying a new one."
5,Excellent!!,"An open, honest account of one man's journey through mexico. Thought provoking and memorable, Malas Ondas should certainly find a place amongst the finer memoirs written in recent times."
3,roses on cake serving set,"This product is a little cheap. It looked alright, but cheaply made. You can see the glue that holds the roses on and the second the roses got wet, the red leaked out. If you want to use this just once it is great, just dont get it wet (be carefull while washing)."
3,"Great concept, cheap implementation","This book has great animation and the ""upside-down /turn-around"" concept is a great attention-getter every time. The pigs illustrated are easy to comment on (although somewhat tough to identify once they are all... naked), and my daughter has even found names and remembers all of them (she's a 2-year old). Problem is, it is way too big for little hands (I thought it would be smaller), the pages are too thin for little hands to turn (a few paper-cuts are in order...), the ink smells bad and it is by no means a ""bathtime"" book, in the classic sense of being able to take it into the baby bathtub..."
5,Great book for a beginner,"This book is very easy to understand and is great for you if you are just beginning to sew. You get all the information you need to start sewing! I found this book easy to read, very informative and overall I loved it!"
5,I keep it on my bedside table,I don't know how anyone could open or run a consignment shop without this book! I refer to it almost every day.
4,Belle Cantrell,This book came quickly and in very good condition. Thank you for your promptness in this transaction.
4,Great read.,Really enjoyed this book. Likeable characters and an easy summer read. Loved the insight into the life of a woman in the 1920s.
4,not what I expected,"Based on the introductory portion available to read online, I expected something lighter. Running afoul of the KKK is no laughing matter.I did enjoy it, it just wasn't what I was looking for at the time. We see how people are tricked & persuaded to break the law so that others can profit. And how other people can live in the same house for years & never really know what the other thinks of them."
4,Great for a book club.,A really enjoyable story that gave me an insider's look of an era of change. I was entertained throughout and felt like I had a history lesson at the same time. Belle was a woman lived by her own rules that were fairly scandalous back in the 1920s but certainly not in today's climate. This was a fun read that book clubs would enjoy.
3,Not the magic of Sissy LeBlanc....,Though I enjoyed this book I found it not to be as good as the story of Sissy LeBlanc. Would still reccomend but dont expect the magic of the first novel.
5,Amazingly Visual,"This book was an easy read and extremely pleasant. In addition there was so much description I found myself finishing the book and wishing I could ""watch more"" of it.Book #2 definitely made me want to ready book #1."
4,Bad Behavior Can Be Good,"Stayed up late last night and finished Bad Behavior which I really liked. A very unconventional love story with the KKK, anti-semitism, Chicago race riots, Southern social history and a lot of Southern proper behavior thrown in. Rules for women that we didn't know existed. We have the cutting of the hair, the cutting of the ties to the 19th century and yet, the infinite human need for love and/or sex. Our heroine is badly behaved but in a way that one can't help liking. And the Jewish man she falls in love with, unlike the 20th century Jewish male model celebrated by Seinfeld, Woody Allen and Saul Bellow--whiny, desperately in need of a mother and good cooking, narcissistic and pathetic, is more like the second generation Jewish male one pictures in the early twentieth century--self reliant, hard working, intellectual and urbane. Altogether a great read. Bravo."
5,The Redneck Pyramid,"A history lesson, a romance, a comedy of manners - The Bad Behavior of Belle Cantrelle is a carefully layered, thoughtful, yet screamingly hilarious story from an an obvious insider.I get the feeling that Loraine Despres lived, saw and/or heard every moment of this book.Belle Cantrell, Bourreé LeBlanc, and Abe Rubinstein are as vividly etched as Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, and Ashley Wilkes.I majored in political science and served in the New York State Assembly - and the detailed analysis of the KKK as a money-making pyramid, an elaborate Ponzi scheme, selling racism on commission (much like Mary Kay or Amway products) was a jaw-dropping revelation to me.BRAVO, Loraine Despres! Your research and artistry gave me one HELL of a history lesson, and one DEVIL of a story!Nelson Denis, Esq.New York, NY"
5,Great collectible. Unique,"This was a lot larger than I expected. Excellent detail and comes with a Tommy Gun, and a 357 hand gun revolver. Looks great when seen next to the ""Scarface"" deluxe action figures."
2,An ambitious but flawed angle on a worthy subject,"Coles'study is ambitious in scope, but it is this ambition which ultimately proves to be his downfall. While he ably sketches out a broad overview of the history of African American writers abroad, the brevity of his study does not allow him to do more than skim across the surface of these rich texts. Perhaps if he had limited his study to Europe or Africa or produced a much longer text, he might have been able to deal more adequately with his subject matter. In addition, the datedness of most of Coles' sources make it obvious that this is merely a superficial update of a 20 year old study rather than one rewritten with more recent critical work by Paul Gilroy and many others in mind. The subject is deserving of a major study. Unfortunately, Black Writers Abroad is not it."
5,excellent,"jackie gleason story how he got off a bus in ny city with pennies in his pocket became a star ended up owning much of hollywood,, his drinking brawling spending s prees family life beginning to end originator of many sitcoms to follow about the struggling middle class working man / not too be missed"
1,Run very small,"I bought these for my granddaughter who is very petite and 3T is normally large on her, these were so tight around the waist she could not wear them."
4,Classic Thai Story,"M.R. Kukrit Pramoj is a renouned, Thai author famous for several pieces he wrote during his lifetime. The stories in this book gives the reader a feel for Thai culture and values, especially as they relate to Buddhism. It was a very well crafted (and translated) story worth reading, especially if you are interested in learning more about the essence of Thai culture."
1,"A thin retelling of ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey""","MR Kukrit was an excellent author in his own right, and it's a shame he felt the need to pad his vida by translating Western works without crediting the authors. He did it with ""Kawaw Thi Bang Phlaeng"" (The Cuckoos of Midwich) and with ""Many Lives,"" which is Thornton Wilder's ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey"" set in Thailand, and probably with others. It is unfortunate that MR Kukrit did not simply give credit where credit was due."
2,"Great sound, but.....","It sounds great, but the instruction brochure was written by an idiot, and leaves lots to be desired; description of how to use a tuner, CD player, phono very poor. My unit arrived with a broken foot. The remote is black in color, with gray lettering in .01 font--very hard--no impossible--to read. The graphic eq. does not work with the remote. No balance function on remote or unit. The volume tends to increase or decrease on its own. I'm probably going to return for repairs or replacement. Great sound, but disappointed with remote and instructions and overall quality."
3,No Phono input,"The amp works well but I am a little disappointed that it has no phono input so my records play too quiet to hear. An additional pre amp is required. If you have a record player with your system, pick a different amp"
4,amplifier,This works great and is what I need to run extra speakers and a TV. I can turn up speakers away from the TV or even turn the TV speakers off.
2,Ugh...,"**From a student's perspective** I still have yet to find a decently written math book and this book is no exception. Most of Rosen's examples were extremely confusing and many (usually his proofs) contained severe jumps in logic. It almost seemed like he assumed he knew how he got to where he jumped to. However, since I am a novice at Discrete Math, I could not. I did find, however, that the book was a little less confusing if I read the material after my professor lectured over it. Trying to read it beforehand was almost hopeless, for me at least. There has to be a book that is more clear than this one. I just hope other students have better luck with this book than I did."
2,Good entry into discrete math but lacks some explanations,"I am a student at UCB, and use this text book. It provides a very good basis for probability, and talks to the student in a well-mannered way. That is the problem, however, because the book cannot follow the curriculum the professor is teaching. For both professors I have taken, none of them could accurately develop midterm/general problems that the book would have been able to prepare you for. Sometimes it presents information while skipping over some needed explanation for intermediary steps, and offers ambigious problems that could very well be stated in easier to understand terms. This book's examples in teaching how to solve problems become useless after the 5th-10th review question out of the 50."
2,College is dropping discrete math as a requirement,"And here's why. Discrete math is actually math proofs. Plain and simple. I recently dropped a discrete math class (for the second time) that used this book. The professor was fed up with it also! I don't pretend to fathom all there is in the book, though the section on the chinese remainder theorm is good. It has its points. But then maybe the subject matter just isn't gathered together cohesively enough to make a class of it. Check your local colleges. Do they offer discrete math? My opinion is that this stuff is better scattered over several different classes on algorithms, math proofs and digital logic."
5,very good book for CS majors,This is a serios book for CS majors; concept are well defined and there are good examples. Best of all it has plenty of excersises after each chapter; I found it a great textbook for studying.
1,worst mathematics textbook I've even encountered,"Rosen claims the book is error-free, yet my copy was riddled with nonsensical errors. His examples & discussions are mostly trivial. There are some very challenging problems in the exercises that went beyond the scope of the presented material, though, and these were the assigned problems. I did not know of one student who did not despise this text, as well as the course, wholeheartedly. People in the library would shout out loud, ""I HATE THIS BOOK. I HATE THIS COURSE!"" I have never encountered such distaste for any other book or course in my academic career. I do not understand why this book is used; why not just use Knuth instead--he is a far superior communicator."
2,Not organized enough,"I have this book as a text for my CSI 210 class, Discrete structures in Logic. I find this book very irritating in that several things the reader is expected to know and with other, they are given to the reader with out a why. 'This is how it is, accept it'"
1,Sad but true...,"As most of the other people have stated, this book is without a doubt one of the worst reads I have come across. I had to chuckle when one of the other reviews mentioned the Linear Algebra book by Lay...an excellent book. This book, however, fails to use an approach useful to students because it seems to be written to other mathematicians. This is typical because math books are reviewed by other mathematicians. It is a ""good"" book if it is difficult to read! The lack of logical progression from step to step in the proofs simply frustrate the learner. Moreover, the complication of simple concepts is the usual approach here because the writer erroneously assumes that everyone speaks ""math speak"". Final word: Remember your roots Mr. Rosen...come back to earth."
1,There must be better books.,"I'm a CIS student at the University of Florida, and use this book for my Discrete Structures course.Fortunately my instructor heavily supplements the text with thorough lectures, because this is one of the most obtuse and incomplete texts I've yet encountered.The author has the habit of introducing new material in the homework problems-- for example, nowhere in the book will you learn how to determine if n-factorial is big-O of a function, but it's a homework question, and there are many like that."
4,Awesome grinder,"Just a short time ago I cut a fifty gallon drum in two, longways.This grinder is a tuff little tool.Awesome. TopnotchTake your time. This grinder is not real high torc.If you let the grinding wheels do there job and don'tpush it too hard this thing will go through just about anything!Worth very penny."
2,dont waste your money,"An air grinder is SO much better. This grinder is either on....or off and is VERY hard to control. Its big, bulky...and just not worth having. I used it to cut 3 concrete stones that were 3"" thick. Then I used it to grind a metal bar on and off for 5 min. The 5th time I used it....it broke. The closest service center is 25 miles away."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this case to keep my phone protected against all the hazards of my job. So far, after two weeks, it's kept my phone protected... but, the clear plastic window is way too scratch prone (even soft kleenex tissues scratched the window!), the top part of the case is too easily opened with the tab that sticks out (the phone stays in the case, however), and there is too much freeplay inside the case; the phone doesn't rattle around in the case, but it does slip up and down some, which is enough to make the top row of keys (option buttons and the joystick) a bit difficult to use without re-seating the phone. It does an adequate job of protection, from what I've seen, but I plan to get something better as soon as I can."
3,"Didn't hate, didn't love it","Honestly, the entire book could have been shortened to less than half its size and would not have lost anything. The book is extremely repetitive and borderline boring. That being said the ""Just War Theory"" it is explaining is interesting, idealistic and near impossible, but interesting nonetheless."
5,Excellent Book,A grew up on the 4th Edition in 1949. This latest edition shows how much the world of neurology has changed for the better. A great read for medical students and established practitioners.
5,A mexican history masterpiece,"Traditional mexican history books always have a tendency to hide or overlook the terrible aftermath of the War with the US. The traditional explanation is that Santa Anna sold half of the country but ""M?xico Mutilado"" provides a totally different standpoint. It is true that Tejas, California and New Mexico were stolen by a powerful pirate with a mask of a fierce freedom defender but even the US most powerful cannons didn't cause the damage that the ""civil war"" between liberals and conservative was taking place since Mexico Independence from Spain. US generals didn't fight alone this war, Mexico was stabbed from inside: Santa Anna (allied with Polk), Roman Catholic (pig) priests and traitors help to destroy a young nation. Again, this is a real MASTERPIECE that helps to understand not only the US war but the complete history of an independent Mexico."
5,Great book - great receipes,"I found the receipes to be easy to use - you do have to figure out your own way of infusing the oil for the flavor - but it is a cookbook with great pictures, presentations and ideas."
4,Under Water Talk,"The is a great little book to tell you how to communicate wit your fellow dirvers. This book goes far beyond just simple common communcation like ""Are You OK"". I recommend this book for those who are serious divers."
4,"Usefull, prefer Scubasigns","Nice overview of the diving signals, very compact so easy to carry around when going on scuba holiday. If it comes down to the fun factor I prefer Scubasigns which features photo's instead of graphics."
2,in search of an outlet,"This is in no way a how-to book! It is a rambling, amusing, often incomplete, personal introduction to this author's world of ideas about writing books, & meeting other writers & the POD (Print On Demand) companies who will publish them.While I often liked the way Anonymous GG writes, she does need an editor to coach her on how to finish her books. Unfortunately, this free spirit doesn't believe in editors.& the section containing answers to a questionnaire she had people fill out at Book Expos? Some useful information from POD publishers & some statements by writers with no time to re-write.RebeccasReads recommends AUTHOR UNKNOWN, AUTHOR UNDAUNTED as a cautionary tale for beginning writers only."
4,great historical memories,This book made a wonderful gift for my retired fighter-pilot husband's 81st birthday. He flew the Scorpion and this helped him remember the many memories (both good and not-so-good) about his times in that aircraft. The product arrived in plenty of time with the extra shipping paid to guarantee just that.
2,"poor, very poor",they really do suck. with many portable speakers in the 20-40$ range that sound pretty good these should fall in the five dollar range. dont bother.
3,eh,"they were decent speakers but the batteries fidgeted around, taking away power and therefore disabling my alarm, making me late several times......additionally they only lasted a few months and were not very loud....fold-up shape is very convenient and comes with a nice case"
4,Divino's Divine Voice,"This album includes the hit single Noche De Travesura with Hector ""El Father"" and Divino's got some heavy hitters on there. There are some really good records on here. What really gets me though is his beautiful voice. Truly a talented singer."
1,THE AUTHOR IS MAKING OVERSIMPLIFICATIONS.,I BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR IS BIASED ABOUT THIS MATTER AND THAT HE FAILS TO DRAW AN OBJECTIVE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS. HE SHOULD HAVE DONE A MORE DETAILED SEARCH BEFORE WRITING THIS BOOK AS MANY ARGUMENTS HE MAKES STAND VERY MUCH IN THE AIR.THE AUTHOR IS QUITE SUBJECTIVE IN VICTIMIZING THE KURDS AS A NATION.READ ANOTHER BOOK IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET REAL INSIGHTS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM
3,Fine woodworkers do not necessarily make fine writers,"I bought this book because I wanted to build the laptop computer table. I am astounded by the glaring errors in the ""plans"" for this table. I haven't yet finished building the table but have already encountered six errors in the plans.The text is misleading and in some parts downright wrong. In many cases, you are left to figure out your own dimensions.Do not cut anything based solely on the cut lists in this book. The best advice I could give you is to use the plans in this book as a guide - NOTHING MORE!Make your own drawings and double - triple check the dimensions before you cut a single board.Coming from Taunton Press - the publishers of Fine Woodworking magazine, I would have expected meticulous attention to detail in this book. Unfortunately, fine woodworkers do not necessarily make fine writers."
3,Shame on the proofreader!!,"I have to agree with Peter Anger....Venture very carefully when using this book for anything beyond an idea! It has beautiful pictures, awesome designs, great drawings, but very inconsistent and inaccurate dimensions. I am building the pedestal desk and have found several mistakes already including conflicting measurements within the same drawing. Make sure you double check all the wood dimensions given and you can make yourself some beautiful furniture."
2,"In a Snap, not for beginners","I fell for the ""SNAP"" but found the book too advanced since I have not learned the basics of word processing yet.The ""look inside"" feature was not available for this book. MEC"
3,Solar atomic clock is a great idea,"Solar atomic clock is a great idea. This works well once you configure it. The only configuration you have to do is setting the time zone.If it ever runs out of power you have to set the time zone again.It takes a while to pick up the correct time, but that's not a real problem.It sleeps when the light is low."
4,Works great,Good service. as advertised. Works beautifully even across a room from the light. It is sometimes hard to read from an angle.
5,POCO rocks and rolls...with a little bit of country,"A great sample of the brilliant early work of Poco, a truly under appreciated band that was a major influence on the country rock groups that followed. Enjoy."
4,"Unless you bake very small pizzas, a bit bigger would be better","My only complaint is this blade is not wide enough to cut a medium sized pizza easily with one motion. I find it necessary to re-position to cut all the way across, and this tends to make more stuff stick to the blade."
3,Works but not what expected for the price,Thought it was a little on the small size and seems a little cheap constructed. But it does effectively cut pizza. Would be best used for pizza around 12''
5,Enjoying this knife in my kitchen,"I was concerned that this pizza knife might not be quite long enough for my homemade pizzas, which I bake on 14"" pizza stones. Although the blade is actually 13"" long--not 14"" (believe me: I measured), the rocker action helped me gain the other 1"" needed to slice thru my pizzas without repositioning. (The blade is sharp MOST of the way around; the first 1"" of blade closest to the handle on each side hasn't been sharpened to protect you from cutting yourself.)If you're cutting a 14"" pizza or smaller, you'll enjoy this knife. But it's a little more difficult to reach 14"" needed than with a longer knife. (You have to go for the FULL rocking action to reach 14"".)Yet for the huge savings over most 20"" rocking pizza knives--I'm happy. If I get tired of the ""full rocking,"" I can always make my pizzas a tad smaller!"
3,Look closely at dimensions! Appears larger than it really is.,"I was looking for a professional (like the ones I used while working at a certain pizza chain) rocker knife and was completely fooled by the picture of this item. It is a nice knife, but the size leaves something to be desired, along with the fact that you can't hang it without drilling your own hole. (As another reviewer stated)"
1,no blade cover.,no way to keep the blade sharp or keep it from cutting fingers. very poor design. don't know why they don't supply something to keep it safe.
3,Just blaugh,"Parting Notes is an OK book, but so many people just focus on their own lessons they learned, which makes for an interesting story, but I am always looking for more - how does this apply to me? Do I have to have die or have an NDE myself? I liked Tiffany Snow's book better, just one chapter about her great NDE, but alot about connection to the other side, and how anyone can open up, if they learn how. I'm not saying Parting Notes is a bad book, really, but I guess I was just expecting more. Some stories in Notes were really gray - no ""life"" in them. Just blaugh."
5,Wow! This is a Fantistic BooK!,"Finally, I have found a book that tells the truth about what it is like to die and it is so up lifting!If you are interesting in spirituality and metaphysics. If you love the Seth books by Jane Roberts, you will want to read this book. I just ordered 5 copies to give my friends and family. This is not the usual new age fluff or religiously based ""heaven"" and ""hell"" kind of stuff. If you want the truth about what it is to contemplate dying and what happens after, if you are interested in the spiritual approach, this is a really great book!"
3,Good but Monotonous,"This book started off really good, it kept me interested, but as I got further into it, the stories started sounding the same. Having just lost my mother, I wanted to get some comfort from this book, but I was left with questions and doubt about where my mom's spirit really is."
1,waste of money,"I received the book and was impressed by the cover and was really excited about reading it. I read the whole book in about 3 hours and could not believe that it had been published. I believe in communicating with the spirit world, but this was the worst book i had ever read concerning such. Dont waste your time or money."
4,Enjoyed it,I enjoyed this book. The different time periods and I found it interesting the last thoughts people would have as they left this dimesion and found themself in the next one... some of the last comments was how to live your life boldly and positive! I found it it positive and uplifting...
3,Parting Notes,I have not finished the book as yet.However I find it interesting.I think that everyone who reads this book.Must decide for themselves if they believe it or not.However I did find it intertaining.
4,Good fast cutting blade with minor chipping,Used this on porcelain floor tile and it cut fast compared to the blade included with the saw. Only my second blade so not much to compare on. There was minor chipping that sometimes caused a second cut.
4,"Cuts through like bread, not butter","I have a 'cheap' (off-name) but powerful wet saw. The blade it came with was ok, but left some chipping. The new Dewalt blade has helped immensely. I've cut 12x12 3/8"" granite tile in diagonals and 6x6 1/4"" tiles with ease. There is still a small bit of chipping, but much less and less frequently; nothing that is unusable. Overall, I'm really pleased with the blade."
1,FOS not good,"This has FOS in it, Inulin, which can adverse affects. I cannot take inulin, and my younger daughter seemed to have broken out in a rash from it. Do the research on FOS and inulin."
5,Great Book to Introduce Sciene!,"This is a wonderful book to introduce kids to the concept of ""science."" I am a teacher and I used this book to explain to my Kindergarten students what science is and what we would be learning about. Even though the language was above them, they still understood the concept and were very engaged in the book."
4,Dewalt DW849,"This polisher is top of the line, well worth the money; if it's like all my other Dewalt tools I will have it for ever."
1,"Bad gearing,and more.","I have had my polisher less than one year.I have had the spindle replaced twice do to abnormal gear sounds, and viberations.And just today the electronic module well R.I.P. I will say this at first i loved it and now i hate it.By Andy.K A long tine detailer."
1,DW849 hunka junk,"be forewarned... the speed dial (Dewalt calls it PN N034009 control module) is worthless. It soon controls nothing. Obviously mine isn't the only one with this problem, since a replacement from Dewalt is $57.95, and they're always on backorder. Most part suppliers won't even list it. I guess if you want to use this at 3000 RPM and burn paint, it works fine."
5,Dewalt 849 buffer,"This is the Sixth Dewalt 849 that I have bought for my detail business, they last forever with very few problems. our oldest one is over 15 yrs old"
4,A brief overview,"Hegel is a complex thinker, very relevant to modern political and sociological ideas. This is a valuable but quite demanding critical and evaluative account of his ideas, by various contributors, all of high quality. The study really does require an accompanying Hegel reader to enable you to locate the arguments properly in Hegel's own work. It's also better if you have read a good introductory text first, though the Wikipedia account is probably a good enough start. It's particularly well written, marked by clarity and good organisation of the ideas."
1,Sad about smaller sizes,"PacSun has stopped carrying any sizes of Nollie fragrances larger than the 0.5oz tester sizes. I love the smell and it is my favorite perfume, but the $12.50 price tag for a tiny tester size is insane. It is especially insane because the fragrance itself is very light, requires more sprays than other perfumes, and wears off quickly and easily. When it was available in the large bottles it was a 5 star product because it smells fantastic and the price was great, but now it is a 1 star. It would take 3 1/2 small bottles at $12.50 each to equal one large bottle that was under $30.00. The small size is good as a travel size for your purse or for a child, but for those of us that do not want to buy in bulk or return to the store every 2-3 weeks, it is really disappointing."
4,good british 80's pop,Aztec Camera (ie Roddy Frame) was making great british guitar pop in the 80's and then fizzled in the 90's after the album Love. This is a great reissue of their best album paired with the hard to find ep which includes a great version of Van Halen's 'Jump'. Mark Knopfler produced and the sound quality is present. This is solid music that shouldn't be forgotten....ps- check out the web site for wounded bird records (good reissue stuff).
5,War in a Cold Climate,"This is the memoirs of one of the best destroyers of U-Boats in the Second World War. Only one RN comander sank more U-boats than Donald Macintyre. And this is an excellant writer who tells a very good story. If the reader wants to know how it was to fight this battle, the reader will find no better book than this one."
2,Worked for only a short period of time.,"Our 4 month old loved this toy, at first. But we have had to replace the batteries so frequently that in the end it didn't work more than it did. Runs through batteries much too quickly. Also, unable to start it from the remote control so we had to reach over the carseat and push the button to begin. But now it is in the trash because I touched the straps holding it up and they disintegrated into blue dust. Not very safe. Very disappointed."
1,Worst Purchase I Ever Made.,"I bought this bouncer seat hot off the presses and now, I wish I hadn't. The ""Toy Bar"" didn't work more than 5-minutes out of the box. So, I called Kids II for a replacement. 10 days later, I got a replacement that looked as if it had been pulled from a dumpster and OF COURSE, it didn't work. Toy Bar #3 worked for a month and now, it too has stopped functioning. Definetly NOT worth the price for such lousy quality. A surprising disappointment from a product that carries the Baby Einstein label. Will instead replace the bouncer seat with Baby Einstein Exersaucer, which has received over 100 glowing reviews."
3,Love the Bouncer but Bar not working either,"I thought it was just me, but I guess it is a problem of this bouncer. My baby loves it and plays with the mirror and bear. Unfortunately, the toy bar stopped working and I can no longer get it to play music and lights. I will see if I can get Baby Einstein to send me a replacement... Too bad my baby is going to outgrow it soon."
2,Toy Bar Quit Working,The toy bar quit working on ours as well. Unlike some of the other reviewers we were able to get several months of use out of it at least but you would expect better quality from the price and the Baby Einstein name.
1,Save Your Money!,"Talk about underwhelmed. I'm a huge Baby Einstein fan, but they missed the boat on this one. First, the remote doesn't work. Click it all you want, it won't work. Next, to turn the toy on and off (since the remote doesn't work) you have to touch the Baby Einstein button which is located exactly where they baby kicks its feet. So, they baby spends the trip turning the thing on and off and never getting to enjoy it. Finally, the mirror is rectangular and distorted so you can forget about seeing your baby's face to know if they're asleep... happy... whatever. I'm going back to the plain round mirror surrounded with jungle animals. His own smile back at him was more entertaining than this toy could ever be. Don't even get me started on how many batteries I went through in the first month of using it. What a waste of money."
2,Remote doesn't work!!,"I bought this product for my 3 month old for Christmas and when I went to play with it, the remote didn't work. I did everything it said to do and it still didn't work. So, I took it back and just exchanged it for another thinking it was just faulty. When I took it out, the remote to it also didn't work. It says it has to be on ""Play"" (not Try me or Off) and it has to do it's short musical fanfare after you push the button on the front and then you can use the remote but nope. You should be able to control the volume, the song options, and be able to switch from colors to music but no. It just plain doesn't work. I really want it to work because it would be great in the car but sadly, I will have to take it back but this time I'll get my money back......I do not suggest buying this product."
5,It works!!!,"Like many, the toy bar stopped working, ours was after 30 minutes!!! I thought I broke it because I played it for that long. I didnt bother returning it since we also have the Baby Bjorn Baby Sitter and my daughter loves the vibrating option and loves the toys I would hang on the bar. When I replaced the battery I was surprised to find out that the bar works! I think I must not have attached the wire to the battery pack properly because I havent had a problem since."
1,Don't bother buying this....,"Don't bother buying this unless you are just in the need of the mirror. The music/lights feature is a joke. Even worse is the remote. You can't use the remote to turn it off or on. It shuts off automatically and conveniently turns on automatically sometimes too. (Usually just as baby starts to fall asleep.) Plus the units on/off button is located in a place where it always seems to get turned on as you take the baby out of the carseat. Which also awakes the baby and drains the batteries if you don't notice it is turned on. Also you can't see the lights during the day so if it gets bumped and turned on and the volume is off then there goes the batteries. Basically, everything everyone is saying is totally true. I wish I saved my receipt on this on as it would've totally gone back to the store. This thing sucks big time."
1,It worked once,The clicker worked once! I tried taking the batteries out and put new in...it just bit it.
1,Horrible Car MIrror!!!!!!!!!!,"I chose this mirror so my daughter would have something to entertain her when we rode in the car at night...boy was I in for it! Within the first week, the remote that came with it stopped working. I replaced the batteries and it worked...for another week!! Then the stupid remote stopped working again. We took it out of our car and she plays with it around the house. The mirror was too small too, but I liked the idea of the music and the lights to be with her while I was driving. Great concept, horrible product!"
3,A battery-eater that babies love,"I would have given this mirror 5 stars based on how much my infant loved it and how well it actually soothed her in the car, if only it weren't for two major problems: First, this toy EATS batteries! It seemed like we were replacing them every 2 to 3 weeks. Second, the mirror lights and sounds just inexplicably quit working after 8 months of regular use, which seemed like a short life-span to me. Despite how often we were changing the batteries, I was very disappointed to throw the mirror away because it had really been entertaining my baby."
1,Not very happy with this,This product has a remote that we cannot figure out. It plays music and there are lights but it is so quiet that our granddaughter can barely see the lights or hear the music. The remote works sporatically. I have changed the batteries and switched the buttons and Yes read the instructions and still can't figure it out.
2,"I love it, but hate it","The music and colors selection are wonderful. My son has loved this mirror since the first day I bought it. However, the remote is a waste of time. My babysitter said the same thing about her remote. Also, after having the mirror for six months it no longer stays on for more than ten minutes. I really liked the product, I only wish that the product worked better. This is one baby einstein prodcut you should skip buying."
4,Toy Bar,"Same as the other reviews, the toy bar stopped working when my baby was only four weeks. So, I called costumer service and they are going to mail another one to me. We will see if the second one holds up."
3,Remote doesn't work,The light show is very entertaining and helps my baby to enjoy the car ride. (he usually hates the car and screams and cries). The remote is hit or miss and most of the time doesn't work. It defeats the purpose of this toy because when my baby wakes up and is upset I need to be able to turn it on. Or when it stops and I would like it to continue playing I am unable to do so. If the remote worked I would give this toy a 5 star review. I get frustrated when the baby is crying and I can't get the remote to work.
2,Fun House Mirror,"Skip this product and get a good mirror like the Eddie Bauer Back-Seat Mirror for half the price. While the lights and music are okay, the remote works inconsistently and the entire unit just devours batteries.The mirror is completely worthless. It distorts the image like a fun house mirror. While you can see an image, you will not be able what your child is doing in the backseat.This was a gift, so we kept it and folded the mirror down. We use an Eddie Bauer Back-Seat Mirror to compensate for the poor mirror on this unit."
1,Has to be a better choice than this,"I'm on my second one. My daughter loved the first one, thought it only occasionally worked, mirror was incredibly distorted and ate batteries like crazy. (Read other reviews - you'll see many of these units do.)I especially hated that it came on by itself and woke her up from naps more than once. Plus, a remote that will not turn the unit on/off - especially needed while driving - is asinine. It eventually quit all together at 6mos and I had to buy another one (grumble)to make my 6mos old happy. If you can find something else, buy it - this one will drive you nuts."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!,We bought this mirror and returned it thinking it was broken as it never worked -- the remote is worthless. Then the second one we brought home ALSO DID NOT WORK with the remote -- which you need when you are driving. We tried changing batteries -- everything! Also the mirror is way too small and distorted so you cannot tell if the baby is asleep. What a waste of money -- disappointing for Baby Einstein and now we are stuck with it because I threw the box away. Oh well. We have replaced it with a basic mirror but was hoping for something a little more stimulating. BABY EINSTEIN YOU SHOULD REMOVE THIS PRODUCT AND MAKE SOMETHING THAT WORKS!
2,Disney is having the laugh on us!,"For the record, here are the complete cartoons on this short set:""Mickey's Delayed Date,""""The Whalers,""""Chef Donald,""""How to Play Baseball"" and""Pluto and the Gopher.""And these are the only reason to buy this set IF you have not bought the Disney Treasures DVDs. Those are the better buy for your money.Do kids who watch 2 1/2 hour movies like Harry Potter & Avatar really need these 6 minute cartoons cut down to 3 minutes? Somebody at Disney Marketing thinks so & they hope you will think so also and buy these again. Their thought is that you get the complete version for the adult fan and the cut-down version for the kids."
1,Not Worth You or your Children's Time and Money,"If you are thinking of purchasing this DVD in hopes of some classic Mickey Mouse cartoons? Then will you be disappointed. These are essentially three types of ""remixes"":- ""BLAM!"" This is just clips of the classic cartoons with cheesy 90's type narrations and an obnoxious high school dropout shouting the word ""BLAM!!!"" every time Donald Duck is hit on the head with something or another. Search ""Disney Blam"" on YouTube to experience this travesty for yourself.- ""Re-Micks"" These are Mickey Mouse shorts mixed up to modern music. (Hannah Montana, Jonas Brothers). Great toons, terrible songs.- ""Short Versions"" These are just the shorts cut down and re dubbed to about three minutes long instead of 8. The interesting thing about these is that we get to hear Brett Iwane as Mickey, as Wayne Allwine passed away last year.In conclusion DO NOT BUY. Go for the Walt Disney Treasures sets instead. These have the cartoons uncut and with a great deal of extras."
3,So-so..,"This video is not all that entertaining and is from the old school of teaching by repetition without any flare. So to learn ""it"" you will hear ""it, it, it, it, it, it, it.""So there is nothing wrong with this but can be a bit boring for todays kids."
3,Sight Words,"Its an okay video. Doesn't really hold my daughter's attention, but I think its a cute video. I suggest using cards and books along with this video. By the way, my daughter is three and can recognize words. FYI- I really wouldn't spend money on this video. I suggest checking it out at your local library first."
3,"OK, but the original was better","A friend loaned us the original Meet the Sight Words and my daughter broke the dvd. So I ordered this to replace it, but they cut out a lot of the words! Instead of 23 words, this version only has 15 and you have to buy Meet the Sight Words 2 to get the rest! This is very annoying, to say the least!"
5,Wow!,"I bought this DVD for my 5 year old, to reinforce the sight words she was learning in school. Wasn't I surprised when my 3 year old, who was watching with her, learned all the words within the first week! They both enjoyed watching this DVD. Not only did it capture their attention, but made the transition from animation to normal print a very easy one. My 3 year old is able to identify the words from this DVD in any type of print! It literally only took watching it a few times!"
3,educational,My three year old loves it but my five year old who I bought it for cannot stand to watch it. It is geared for younger viewers who are not ready for sight words. I wish it was geared for five year olds.
5,Impressed,My child who will be three in Jan loves this DVD and can now read the book that came with it as well as other very simple books.....
2,There are better options....,"We got sucked in by all the positive reviews here. This video is nothing more than animated flashcards, where a word appears on the screen and is then repeated verbally a couple of times. It took me all of 15 minutes to find free software on the Internet that does the same thing, and I can type in whatever words I want. There is nothing wrong with this video, there just isn't anything there to justify the price. Having limited resources, I wish we had spent our eductaion dollars better."
1,The animation does not match the words,this DVD will only confuse the kids because the animation does not match the words at all.
3,Boring but not so bad to have in your teaching library.,"I think this is so boring and would be better to entertain a baby at the Baby Einstein level. I think if your child will watch it it will do no harm and actually help. I was blessed enough to see it on Amazon and then find it at the library so I didn't waste any money but the little bit of gas that I used. If my child likes it at any point I will buy the other 2 volumes since the library didn't have them. I think it is a great concept but extremely boring. I think this would be something like ""Your Baby Can Read."" It is another resource that you can occasionally view. It definitely wouldn't hold your child's attention like Leap Frog."
3,"""It"" is okay","If you are looking for repetition, you found it... It... it... IT...This program is very educational but without much fun so it doesn't hold my son's interest very much the way Leap Frog Letter Factory does. He very rarely asks to watch this video. I wish we had bought the Leap Frog version of sight words instead of this. I chose it because it was highly rated, so obviously it works for some children, just not really mine."
5,My kids love it!,"The words come out as a little character doing a simple activity while the word is being repeated out loud several times. Then the word floats all over the screen again and again while it is being said. As an adult, I don't see much appeal to it, but my kids really like it and they even ask me to play the whole series again and again. My seven-year-old son who has autism has begun reading simple books after watching these videos. I am so grateful to have them!"
5,Love Pprep!,"Love their videos, and it holds our children's attention more than any other videos! My children have learned so my much with my daughter trying I make letter sounds at 9 months of age! You can never start to early or go wrong with Preschool Prep!"
3,Maybe my daughter is too young?,"This is a great idea, and I am sure it is educational. I wish my daughter liked it, but she is completely bored with it. She is almost 4 and is recognizing sight words and beginning to read. I thought this video would reinforce those skills, but she begs to watch anything BUT this DVD. I am saving it to try again in a few months. It is educational, but it feels educational as well. It is not as close to the leapfrog videos where learning is incorporated into the entertainment. It is worth buying to try it with your kid, I think, because at $10 it is worth a try. But, it feels like an educational movie."
2,For my kid*,Not a favorite. I've seen better videos on YouTube.My kid pays more attention to the background then the actual word.I still play it to get my moneys worth but I wont buy the others.
4,not as great as meet the letters,"THe animation in this and the backround sounds sometimes distract my munchkin (5yr) for the actual word its self, so I have to watch it with her and quiz her to help things along. My one year old loves it and stares at it."
2,educational only not entertaining,"I was hoping it would be more like leap frog videos which are very educational but also entertaining with cute songs that help, but this video is only for memorization of sight words."
5,A charming and helpful tool to help little kids get started on the joy of reading,"Meet the Sight Words 1 begins this delightful, educational DVD series for young children. Ideal for little people ages 15 months to 6 years, Meet the Sight Words 1 helps children learn to read basic words such as ""of"", ""play"", ""it"", ""he"", ""you"", ""in"", ""I"", ""to"", ""have"", ""and"", ""a"", ""said"", ""is"", ""the"", ""for"", and ""that"" through anthropomorphic graphics that bring the letters to life, followed by a transition to printed text. For example, the word ""play"" is brought to life with a smiling letter p holding the letter ""l"" as a baseball bat, while the letter ""a"" is made up as a baseball glove and a happy letter ""y"" sits like a game spectator. A charming and helpful tool to help little kids get started on the joy of reading, great for preschool DVD libraries as well as for parents' homes. 40 minutes."
3,NOT SAGE.....More Like Mint,"As stated by the other reviewer, the color is NOT sage green. It doesn't match my decor either as I'd call the color mint or lime. However, they are very soft and the quality is nice."
2,You get what you pay for,"These sheets are not nearly as soft as any other 500-thread count sheets I've ever owned. Also, the fitted sheet was way too big for my mattress (and I have a fairly thick one so I'm usually happy with deep pockets). It's almost like they accidentally sent a king fitted sheet with a queen flat sheet. And I agree with the other reviewers- it's much closer to mint green than sage green."
2,The color is more of a lime-green and not sage,"I bought this set with a recommendation from a friend about the softness and quality. I will return this set as the color is not at all sage, it's more like lime-green that doesn't go with my decor."
5,"Elvis, Elvis, Elvis","My sister has all things re Elvis!! When she redid her bathroom she decided to put him in there also. This shower curtain was a gift and she was thrilled. Product was very well made to withstand daily use. I was glad to find this item at Amazon and, as always, the ordering process was easy and Amazon gets six (6) stars for their shipping and return policies."
2,Not worth the asking price..................,"Have to be honest. I've got dozens of Broadway musical recordings, along with loads of 'em by lounge-singers and ballad performers. The performances here are, for the most part, nothing special; in fact, most of the male voices are kind of ""stinky."" Sorry, guys. Singer, Steve Ross (""I Have Dreamed""), does have a very unusual voice, I'll give him that. But, but, but........the only male singer (Patrick Quinn) placed in the only romantic duet (""People Will Say We're In Love"") has a voice much more suited to Broadway comedic roles---nothing romantic-sounding about it.The girls come off better. Maureen McG. is her reliable self, and Judy K. and Debbie G. are their normal and known selves.In the end, I recommend saving your money for better done songs from Broadway.****"
5,Political Witchcraft,The author has done his homework into American history and polictics. Some of which is not all pretty. It show the thread of sinister forces that have been running in the country since the very begining of this nation. If your a conspiracy buff or not this book will get you thinking.
2,This did not keep my interest,"I've read alot of romance novels so it takes a really fresh plot to keep my interest, with interesting characters of course... this novel had neither. I didn't even finish this ho-hum effort. It is not badly written, but I've read this plot and met these characters before. I was losing interest rapidly and had to force myself to finish it."
2,Not really that good,"""The Seduction of an English Lady"" was the second book I have read by Cathy Maxwell and it wasn't that good.Lady Rosalyn is the daughter of a dead poor earl. Colin Mandland is a war hero who has now come home. Colin now owns Rosalyn's home and want a seat in Commons, so what does who do? He marries her.This book is not that great! The characters are very uniteresting and Key details of the book are left out. All I can say is that I am glad that I did pay for it."
2,Don't Bother,"Maxwell's writing is very elementry. There is no substance to her books, it feels like a debut novel even tho she is considered a seasoned author. Rosalyn was an annoying character with too much pride. Why is that always the reason behind romance novels? I felt the story was thrown together with no depth to any character. Rosalyn was a pathetic woman who was afraid to show her feelings because her mother left. And then instantly she does a one eighty. Oh please.Colin's character is alittle better but there is no background to the story or people. He was just cardboard image. There is no story here. No depth. No true love. I felt the author wrote what I what expected but I never felt anyhting for the story or the characters that were portrayed. I have tried this author in the past and she seems to fail on all levels of romance for me."
3,Another time when 1/2 stars would be nice -- 3 & 1/2,"Not my favorite Cathy Maxwell book. The protagonists are pleasing enough, but their fussing over the house becomes old, but their growing feelings for each other carry the story along as do Colin's political ambition and their struggles with their families. The house itself is nothing but a device, really.The book is pleasant enough, but not nearly as engaging as Maxwell's usual fare, and there is something about it that almost seems unfinished. Thus, it is merely okay."
4,Wiccan Book,Great resource tool. Written in easy to follow and apply manner. Explains the various ceremonies and rituals in understandable fashion.
3,good,good book but it was kinda short. it could have elaborated more. very informative! a good beginner book!
1,Not much here,"This book has very little information about Wright, and the projects are either silly or overly complicated. Skip it."
2,Disapointing,"These sheets were soft, and silky out of the package. But as soon as I washed them...the sheen was GONE and they wrinkled horribly. I don't enjoy ironing king sheets. They are still soft, but the silkiness is gone."
3,price is right,I have a really deep mattress and the fitted sheet is actually bigger and needs to be pulled and tucked in. It is a lot of sheet for the money.
3,somewhere a novel lurks,"Somewhere between the beautiful prose and richly drawn character a novel lurks. Unfortunately, I was never able to find it. As I read I became deeply enthralled with the characters, but as in a nineteenth century Russian novel, there were too many and I had to flip pages back to determine who was whom. The language was intoxicating yet like a too fragrant flower, it became a bit tiresome and finally irritating. I so wanted this book to work because it is a rich experience, but the plot, what there is of it, never really takes hold. Will I read the first book, now that I realize this is a sequel? Probably, but not right away."
1,Lost....!,"This book is so confusing. There are so many different characters and timelines going on that it's difficult to understand. The characters bored me, frankly. Each new chapter was like reading a different unrelated book. Definitely pass on this one!"
2,Huh?,"The POV remains a question and where the title came from is a mystery. Why would a girl kill her father if she loved him dearly? How can one man have that many afairs in a single lifetime? How can one man have that many children from different women in a single lifetime? How can that many women justify having a lustrious afair with a man who slept with more women than Hugh Hefner? The book was strange and it didn't have an exact ending. Nothing was accomplished and it bored me, frankly. Skip this one and move onto All The Finest Girls."
2,linking art to the soul,"This book gave me an insight into the creative process that I had never experienced before. It was just as Gloria Steinem said ""...how to meditate our way into our imaginations & to give our thoughts & feelings visible form"" this book gave me a new found way to discovering my self and the artwork I produce. Thank you so much Nancy, I really appreciate what your book has done for me and hope that others find it as rejuvenating to the soul as I do."
3,Would be better as a CD,"I enjoyed the ideas in the book but found it ultimately not to be very useful. The book consists mainly of guided meditations focused around aspects of creativity. In a CD form it would be useful as an adjunct to actual meditation.The information about the artist and her process was interesting and the guided meditations could be useful in a different format. My one biggest wish is for a lot more hands-on creative exercises. There were a few, but in a book geared towards creativity and ""making"", there should be alot more experiential stuff."
1,Need arbor size,I am shopping for a blade for my saw. It is extremely frustrating when most of the blades on Amazon do not list the arbor size. Would you buy a suit at not specify the size?
1,I Wish I Could Time Travel and Not Read This Book,"I won't re-hash what others have already said. This book is about time travel but Rankin gets caught up in the time travel paradox and I guess he's trying to be clever but it turns into a headache for the reader. Reading this novel is like driving on a highway until you come to a maze of multiple highway connections and start trying to drive on more than one route. That's what Rankin tries to do then sort of stops, or maybe I gave up trying to understand what was happening. As the end of the book approaches, you get the sense that either Rankin went on vacation and someone else took over or he just lost interest in the book and ended it. I felt the latter that by the end of the book, I just didn't care. If I could time travel, I would go back in time and not buy this book."
4,Captivating,"So there I was, flipping through books at a bookstore in Durham, England. This one caught my attention and I purchased it. And it could be the best thing I did in the UK apart from visiting Dunne Castle. Yes, the comparisons to Douglas Adams and such all hold up, but much of the writing also reminded me of the most fabulously funny book of all time, Bored of the Rings. Some of the one-liners and bits of dialog don't go over, and some work very well. The author definitely needs some Ritalin."
3,hilariously ridiculous,"This is not one of Rankin's best, but it's typical of his style. It's a crazy mix of characters, some fictious, some historical, from all different time periods, thrown together and bizarre events unfold. This story has a couple of slow sections but I had to keep reading because I had no idea where the story was going to end up."
2,Not great,"Full of plot holes, rambling, some good ideas but they were not developed properly, or in some cases just completely forgotten. Good start and end but the middle was overly convoluted"
1,This Is Why People Hate Country,"Kenny Rogers is the master of schlock pop country, here he was at the peak of his powers and the peak of popularity and still it's unlistenable. If you've ever heard the title track you've heard it all from Kenny, schmaltzy, trite and completely unbelievable lyrics to soft pop style music. It's an assault on good taste."
3,"Reasonably good anime, but with a very dark bent.","Most Anime has a dark bent, but this one is in a class of it's own. It's not due to the violence implied or graphic, rather it's do the the fatalistic bent. I won't give any spoilers, but don't look forward to a feel good plot."
2,DUBBED!!!,"Don't make the same mistake I did. This is the dubbed version. I waited for two hours for it to download onto my computer. If I had known about this product being dubbed, I would not have purchased the item."
1,no option for subtitles,I'd already seen this anime a couple years ago and adored it then so I decided to buy it. Don't. Or if you do buy the dvds. The dubbing is horrible. Every character has this grating forced cockney accent. Its unwatchable.
5,"Black Butler: Season One, Part 2",This again was a gift item for my daugther. She really loves the series and the books. Another great buy.
3,Let MSD do the install,"I had to buy two of these because the first one broke during install. I normally ship my distributor's to MSD and let them install the gears, but I didn't do it this time and the gear ended up getting cracked. When pressing one of these on, do NOT press on the teeth. I know the teeth offer the most surface area to apply pressure, but use the very small collar (for lack of a better word) instead."
5,"Introductory and readable, yet rigorous","I had read/studied most of this book when I was a graduate student in chemical engineering at Syracuse University (in 1987-88). I also took two courses on the subject from Professor Troutman. I strongly recommend this book to any ""newcomer"" to the subject. The author is a mathematician, and a large fraction of the book consists of theorems, lemmas, propositions, corollaries (and their rigorous proofs). The book also contains, however, a good number of illustrative examples and exercises which make it useful to engineers and scientists as well as to students of mathematics who want to learn more about applications of mathematics to physical sciences."
1,Ditto!,I had an experience almost indentical to that of the other reviewer. The instructions were very difficult to decipher but I found other really straight-forward instructions online......in English. I did everything according to the instructions and when I pushed the lever.........nothing. I will return it and look for a different brand.
1,"Bad mechanical design, no customer service","The seal between top and bottle requires grease to prevent leakage, and still it requires a mighty screw-down. More important and less-easily solved is the design of the screw-on CO2 cartridge holder. It is made of a fairly soft plastic, which engages a threaded metal nipple. Soon the plastic threads on the holder are worn and almost impossible to engage. A metal holder would have solved this problem. A letter to the USA office of Liss went unanswered. I have two (never more!) of these bottles, both failed the same way."
1,Leaks,Liss seems to be totally incompetent: most all of the rubber or plastic seals leak. The instructions are a farce. Customer service is a joke. The price is way high.Too bad because a redisign might make for a decent product. Then again...
4,Much Better than ISI,"I bought the Liss after two bad experiences with ISI. Both leaked within about one month of use. The Liss has operated flawlessly for months now, and I am a soda water freak who goes through a bottle of the stuff in less than two days. The only drawback is the loud bang that it makes when the spent cartridge is unscrewed. Still scares the c**p out of me each time."
1,Shoddily Made,I've had this less than a year and all the seals are leaking. A ridiculous price to pay for something so shoddily made
5,Great fun for kids,"My little brother loved this game. He found that it was much better than the other version. While you can choose from exciting players such as Cobi Jones, a MLS star or Brandi Chastain, a US womens star, you can create teams with the old original backyard kids. You can play a season and eventually end up winning the cup. You can Also play a multiplayer game, but sometimes it gets a little hectic with little players running around the field tripping and kicking the ball. It may get boring after a while, and the controls are a little odd, but it is still a great game for kids"
4,Backyard Soccer 2001 MLS Edition,Product in excellent shape and was shipped faster than I had expected. Great service!
2,All the season in a day,This game isn't all that great. It has a time limit of 2 minutes per half. You can play over 10 games in a day. In backyard baseball you can barely get 1 game in. This is also a very easy game. Occasionaly you get a really good team that beat you in the shootout which is really hard.This game is like beep. Only not.
3,old-school afx,"not worth going out of your way to buy, but definitly worth it for the true fan - normally a hard cd to find, but re-released - to find other cool titles try warp records"
1,Poor and Weird,"That song is worth one star. After that, the songs are very derivative, very dumb, and very boring. If anybody wants to know what this sounds like, think of the Addicts. That's it. Not that I don't like the Addicts, but I personally feel that the Addicts should play the Addicts, and the briefs should play the Briefs. I mean, everything I hear from these guys, right down to the singer, sounds exactly like the Addicts. Except, they've taken the formula, and dulled it down. So in closing, treat this album as you would an Addicts B-side comp: great if your a collector, terrible for everyone else."
1,No whistle...,"What a disappointment. I have owned another Simplex chrome over copper kettle for years and it works beautifully, I needed another kettle and ordered this one - and, to my dismay, it does not whistle at all. I had trusted Simplex to continue to produce a great product - and, instead, I received a defective product. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it. What a shame."
2,No whistle for the weary !,This is an absolutely beautiful kettle but to spend so much for something that's basically a hazard is crazy. It does not whistle!!!
1,disappointed,For the price I would certainly expect it to whistle. It does not. I will be looking into returning it.
5,Great product! High Quality!!!,"Few things in life are perfect, this teapot is one of them. A whistle that 'announces' but never 'demands', a lid that fits with a satisfying 'clunk' and a great finish that looks as it did when opened 10 months ago. Give this as a gift and you'll be remembered years from now,"
5,Fantastic quality kettle.,"Pros: Solid copper throughout, heats quickly and evenly.Chrome finish, not stainless steel, for a rich look.Whistle built in the lid, not the spout. Never scorch your fingers removing the whistle.Rich tone on the whistle.Classic styling from an earlier age.Beautiful craftsmanship.Con: None, if you don't balk at the price.Right now this kettle seems to be out of stock at nearly all the online retailers. I had to dig deep; finally found it at Peet's coffee. They had tons in stock and shipped quickly."
3,"Not the Best, but sufficient.","I got them and plugged them in to my crown xls2000. They were obviously cheap built boxes. The wood that the grill is attached to was super crappy and cheap, broken in so many parts I rebuilt it.The feet they give you are plastic and hard, they broke right away as I was installing them. I will go to the hardware store and get some rubber ones. I also pulled the crossover out, swapped out the 18 gauge internal wiring for some 10 gauge. I also added 3 2x4's that were cut to form the back of the box and brace it together for rigity.I also added one from front to back, where there was an original skimpy one, This worked great. The bass ports had to be glued in cuz they fell out as soon as they made a sound...lol. Long story short, THEY ARE WORTH THE MONEY IF YOU REBUILD THE CABINET AND WRING. Dont expect the best, but they bass hard now that I put in 4 hours of labor into them and a couple studs and about 100 screws . luckily I have a shop."
3,"Has some thump, needs some more...","I have two of these that I power with a Carvin DMC2000. They handle the power well, and they have some low end, but to my ear, they don't seem to cover the low spectrum as advertised with that boom in your chest you get from a set of JBL's (short XMax). However, these things are dirt cheap, and the enclosure is decent, so if the drivers fail, they can be re-used. I have an active crossover, so I can't comment on the internal one. They have 1/4, BP and Speakon connectors, which is a plus. They compliment a pair of 12's on a stick pretty well - good enough to take on the road for a dance crowd in a small-medium sized room. I would buy them again for this low price."
5,Thorough and Readable--A Great Guide For Anyone.,"I do not work in the entertainment industry, nor do I ever intend to be a film, video, sound or any other type of editor professionally. My interest in ""Cut by Cut"" came from wanting to learn just a few editing basics. I have a closet overflowing with scores of VHS home videos that I'm transfering to DVDs. Soon after beginning this project, I realized it would be possible and fun to do something creative with the miles and miles of my footage. Something better than just a direct transfer. Something polished. But I didn't know where or how to begin. ""Cut by Cut"" told me exactly what I needed to know. I learned the hows and whys of film editing in a way that was clear and readable for a novice like me. Sure, this book has tons of information for industry professionals and wannabees--stuff I'll never use. But it has the basics, too. The stuff I was looking for. Who could ask for more than that?"
5,Terrific Text Book OF Finishing a film,"A comprehensive, updated, description of how to post, edit and finish a film including both creative and mechanical processes. Clearly written, many tables, charts, and illustrations. Covers film, digital, and web preparaton workflows. Fabulous book. High recommenation. But this leans on the technical and workflow side, not the creative. A wonderful review of the ENTIRE process. Necessary text for all film students."
2,blanc pages,"If you buy the book, you have to be prepared to read much useless information.The interesting part of the book (10 to 15 pages) focuses on practical editing problems.The rest of the book contains endless lists of unnecessary information on video/film editing.From 360 pages of the book only 10-20 really count.Other books like ""on editing"" by Edward Dmytryk or "" the technique of film editing"" by Karel Reisz contain full, real, deep, dense information on the subject.And for the amateur/enthusiast/prosumer film/video maker (like me) there is one book that really arms us for the battle in that difficult field.A book with myriads of most valuable information.A book that it's a pity only few knowledgeable people have mentioned it.The ""Five C's of cinematography"" by Joseph Mascelli.That book every day teaches me. And that author is a big teacher, someone who loves and really wants to communicate his knowledge with fond to learning people."
4,A reality that should be shared,"The Confessions of a thug reveals the inner-world of the drug underworld, a world in which a persons life can be snuffed out in the blink of an eye. Totally moving."
3,my review,"This is a moving film , has it's emotions. acting is not bad. plot is good , rapping is great."
2,Blech.,"This tea doesn't really taste like lychee. It's kind of fruity but not great. If you're looking for real lychee flavor, good luck -- I have yet to find it...and it is certainly not this one."
4,El titulo lo dice todo,"Sinceramente esperaba un fuerte merengue, y eso es lo que trae el disco. Encontre interesante el uso del timbal, si no muy maduramente incorporado.Los musicos tocan fuerte, y los cantantes invitados cantaron bien. Si quieres merengue ""mas durisimo"", no te desespere y consiguete este disco. Muy bueno para fiestas."
5,Gates replacement belts worth the money,"I have always used Gates hoses and belts in my vehicles, don't believe there is any product better and you cannot go wrong!PS,Corpus Christi, TX"
2,More of a propaganda CD,"There are some really great songs on this 2 CD set. However, those really great songs seem to be lightly interspersed amongst a large number of forgettable songs whose main purpose seems to be to remind you of those movies you enjoy(ed) so much.It seems a little odd to me that out of 90 years of film making the most memorable scores have been largely released within the last few years. I was pleased to find themes from the Godfather, Indiana Jones and Witness. I was perplexed with the inclusion of songs from Rugrats, both Mission Impossible movies (one would have been more than enough) and Tomb Raider (memorable???).This is my own personal bias, but I do prefer movie soundtracks that evoke a feeling of excitement. With this collection I just couldn't get excited. I kept finding myself being let down by songs that didn't in some way complement the preceeding song.There are certainly some great tracks here, but overall I was disappointed. My advise would be to look elsewhere."
3,90th Anniversary Memorable Scores,I'm on the highway a lot and enjoy listening to music without words. Composer John Williams is one of my favorite composers who has written many Movie Themes and this one is up there with other famous themes he's written that I especially enjoy.
5,The meme polluting public discourse,"A meme is an idea , behaviour or style that spreads between and within national cultures where it mutates to suit local circumstances. It can be beneficial or toxic and tends to reproduce quickly. Don Watson présents a perceptive and disturbing critique of the adaptation of the toxic capitalist management meme to the lingua franca of everyday language. He details the consequences of the elevating legal and accounting imperatives over humanistic and philosophical tenets to public policy, pursuit and appraisal. The result is to promote conformity, decrease personal and group responsibility, lower initiative and innovation and increase individualistic and group selfishness. All in all a damning critique of the way ""commerce speak"" currently diminishes the scope and quality of public discourse in the western world."
3,Rather Average,"This Haggadah was just OK. Definately NOT for use with non-Messianic people in my opinion. I had a Jewish co-worker take a look at this and she agreed that it would be somewhat offensive to the non-Messianic. I ordered 20 copies for use at the Seder I make for our church, and there were several places which had different texts from one book to the other. I don't think I will be using these books again!"
4,Quality Item,"This is a very good storage ottoman. It's very well constructed, the leather is extremely nice, the hinges are smooth and sturdy. It came fully assembled and exactly as advertised. I think it's a good value for the price and it seems like it will last a long time. You can also use this as extra seating but it doesn't work as well for putting a tray on top of or other items since they risk sliding off the smooth leather. Overall, a good purchase.Hope this helps & good luck with your purchase!"
3,excellent for emergency lighting but tv no good in digital age,"This unit was purchased prior to the digital conversion and at that time it was great! Everything worked as advertised but after the digital conversion when analog went away, the tv part is now useless unless you have some type of digital convertor that can also be used without plugging into the wall which I have not found so buyer beware for the tv part."
3,Buy this at a garage sale,"NOT worth $75.00. Radio works fine, TV has very limited capability and hard to tune, Lamp/light have limited range of motion. Compass/clock is a joke."
5,"Hooks Through Your Grateful Head, Hooks, Hooks","My goodness, people, what is going on? Have reviews been eliminated/compromised/deleted/rejected/dejected? I'm the first to review this great ep? Why aren't these guys the new Beatles/Kinks/Stories/etc? I know that it's a New World out there, but c'mon, these guys are incredible. What the hell? Hooks, hooks, hooks. First song is the best, the last is the worst, but that's not saying all that much, because they're all pretty damn great. This is a crap review, I know, I'm old and tired, but these guys will make you realize."
5,"Sexy, Saultry and Down Right Wonderful",Jordan's book has it all for the female reader. It's sexy in a very comfortable way; it's deep in literary content and it's provocative with a delicious story line that makes it impossible to put down. I recommend it to all who love spice and not everything nice.
2,Overpriced,Shipping from the company was fast - received in 2 business days. The package was in a plastic bag that was torn - presumably from the shipping.The emblem on the shirt is stitched and well made - not ironed on. The problem is the sweatshirt runs a size too small and is very thin. For $35 I expect a sweatshirt that is thicker than the average t-shirt.
5,Christian Perspective,A Christian perspective of our world today and how even we are desensitized by the constant bombardment of the media etc. controlled by the secular world.
1,Lies that go unchallenged in popular culture by Kathy Elliott Port Charlott Florida,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT SPEND ONE CENT OF YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK IT IS JUST SO BAD JUST GO THE OTHER WAY.Charles Calson and James Bell Jr ARE SICK PEOPLE.
1,This way the evil grows.,"Colson's definition of ""lie"" is simple and pernicious. Any belief he does not share is a lie, and anyone who believes something he doesn't is a liar. It is perfectly fine to reject the beliefs he calls ""lies,"" it's not in the least bit okay to impugn the honor of those who disagree with him.And, of course, a logical analysis of the relevant evidence will reveal that most of the beliefs he calls ""lies"" are in fact true, and the rest are at least arguable.A civilized society requires civilized discourse. A society where the beliefs of others are routinely characterized as lies is not a civilized society."
1,Do not buy.,Did not stick to rubber roof after careful preparation. Waste of money. Better off buying a bucket of tar like I wound up doing.
1,Wildly Destructive,"This is a book based on supposition, lies, and ignorant beliefs. Those who write these books and make such hailing comments on this literature, make the lives of so many people harder than it needs to be.I hope one day Facts and evidence are the normal instead of a blind following. There are many more gay people than you think. Please chose your words carefully because every time you say hurtful words about gay people, you probably offended several people in the room. Even those closest to you may not trust you because of the words you say"
1,Sad,Take advice on how to reach out to *anyone* from someone who lives a life of lies and dishonest self-denial? Not hardly.
1,Shameful,"A self hating man spreading hate and lies that hurt other people. Every legitimate medical and psychological expert agrees that this type of ""therapy"" is ineffective and damaging.I think it is shameful that Amazon would even peddle this type of damaging malarky."
5,God's Grace reaches out to the homosexuals,"This book is written by several people who at one time lived the homosexual lifestyle, but each of them were able, by God's grace and the help of loving Christians to get free from that lifestyle. It's a helpful book. Thanks! God bless!"
1,Spend more to get a better sound,A friend of mine gave me a pair of these cymbals because he was cleaning out his house. The sound is so bad on these things it is embarrassing. They are definitely an entry level cymbal but they sound like two garbage can lids being smashed together. I have played with Zildjain hi-hats my whole life and love them but you need to be willing to spend more to get a good sound. Don't waste your money.
2,Zildjian in name but...,"I purchased a set of these cymbals recently and after having them for only 2 months I am already looking to upgrade. If you take care of your cymbals then just spend a little more and get something with a better sound. Depending on how you play, cymbals can last your whole career or the life of your hobby so don't skimp and buy these just because of the cheap price. If you want quality you need to be willing to pay for it."
1,Great game!,"Love this game, graphics are awesome although they don't run very well. Been playing this for three days solid and got about three hours sleep!"
5,Correction,"The ""Very Scary Mission"" Review is mine. I didnt play it on the pc but on XBOX. Still i may plan to enter a third time, my nerves where racking so badly the last time i braved the place!"
3,Watch out,"Make sure your graphics card has pixel shader 3.0 because mine sure as heck doesn't. So even though I would love to play this game I can't. I'm sure the game would be a fun experience but I should not be obligated to buy the game and spend 50 bucks on a new graphics card as well. Why can't Edios make pixel shadding optional like evryone else?Its not like I have an older computer I just bought the thing 6 months ago, I think I got hossed.Overall-Just make sure your machine mets the requirments they are not kidding."
3,Kind of boring game,"I saw some good reviews on this game, so I thought I would check it out. I played it for several hours, but I never really got into it. It is a different type of game, but it wasn't all that interesting."
3,question,I have recently played theif 3 at my neighbors house for xbox and noticed that it is optional to use a 3rd person view as well as 1st person view i would like to know if this is the same for pc. Also the 3 stars is because i liked it on xbox but havent tried it for pc so i gave an average score.
4,Still captivating.,"The graphics have stood the test of time fairly well, and so many timeless elements add up to make this game very rewarding - the combination of freeform and mission-based gameplay, the noirish voiceover acting, the simple thrills of sneaking, climbing, and running through the city with no one the wiser, and those hilarious comments from the recipient as you beat ineffectually at an armed guard with a blackjack because... well, it's what you have in your hand.Thief 3 watches other stealth games from the shadows, steals their jewelry with a practiced click of the mouse button, flits noiselessly around a corner and simply disappears, watching and laughing from halfway up a wall as they mutter to themselves, ""What the...? It was here a minute ago!"" For someone who couldn't wait for the next installment in this much-respected sneak-em-up series, returning to Thief 3 proved to be a very worthwhile decision."
4,Like A Movie,"I'm a 15 year old girl who would rather prefer talking on the phone than even associating myself with childish video games. But ever since 25 year old brother bought this game, I would always try to watch him play the character of Garret. I love this game, even though I never watched it. I just wish they would add more scarier stuff like the Hag level and stuff."
4,Loved the first twoinstallments in this series and this is more of the same.,"Gameplay and story was excellent as always. A great change of pace vs. running and gunning.Only problem was video glitches that I could not seem to work out with my video card. System would slow/framerate drop when treasure or useable items were highlighted.Despite that one glitch this game, to me, was definitely worth the $$.I can only pray there will be a thief 4!"
4,another great thief game,"deadly shadows continues in the steps laid down by its predecessors. with some big shoes to fill in terms of gameplay and enjoyability this game turns out to be nearly as good as the previous two thief games. if you're a fan of the thief series this is a good buy, you will have some problems with certain aspects that have been dumbed-down so that it could be ported to the xbox but overall it's a good title. first time thieves will most likely enjoy this title as well."
3,Good stealth game,"In an age of firefight shooters - this is very different kind of game. I played Serious Sam and Painkiller before this one, took the run and gun strategies from those games with me into this one, and got slaughtered. This is a stealth game. Much like in Far Cry you got to be nimble and sneak a LOT to succeed.The atmosphere in some levels (especially Shalbridge Cradle - an abandoned asylum/orphanage) is just plain creepy. The game itself (lasting approx. 20 hours) is worth playing just because of this level.The story is also very well implemented. Unravelling the identity of the Gray lady keeps the player interested.Graphics are good - not great. The loading screens between the different parts of the city are a bit tedious though.AI is not bad at all. Citizens will fetch guards if they catch you blackjack someone.A great FPB - First Person Blackjacker :-)"
3,A nice read,"This novel is appropriate for ages 10-14. Walks in Beauty by Hazel Krantz is the story of Anita Whiterock, a Navajo teenager who walks between two nations - that of the Native American and of mainstream America.Four years after her father left for Albuquerque, Anita continues to mourn the loss. She is angry with him and doesn't believe he loves her. Her anger spills over into her relationship with her mother, causing a strain. Anita is also experiencing, at age fifteen, the first blush of romance with all the typical problems and obstacles.Walks in Beautyis a well-written novel that gives readers a brief look at the Navajo life. Its pace is slow and the story is sweet in its own way. And that sweetness makes it so refreshing in an era where gritty and edgy stories reign-even if readers even if we'd rather read a sweet story."
2,"Good Actors, No Budget","Do yourself a favor and stick with Spencer Tracy, especially if you're planning on showing this to a high school audience. My class made it through 30 minutes and then I stopped it, mercifully. I know when to cut my losses."
1,Forget this version,"If you loved the Spencer Tracy version, this will be a great disappointment. Quinn turns in a respectable performance, but it is wooden compared to the Tracy version. The story is also muddled by the repeated insertion of Hemingway himself supposedly observing the story unfold, and then to later write it up. Bottom line, save your money"
1,Video unviewable,The Old Man and the SeaThis DVD is completely unviewable. The picture is broken up into little squares.
3,Good knife; some concerns,"I was looking for a good, American-made pocket knife and bought the Case Sod Buster, Jr. It seems to be a solid knife, but I wish it had a lock-back mechanism. I thought most quality folding knives had it, and did not realize this one lacks that feature until I got it out of the package. My other concern is that when the knife is closed, one sharp corner of the base of the blade juts out from the handle, creating a potential ""pocket-ripper"" situation. I don't know why this is so...as I've never seen it in another knife. I think Case should have rounded off that corner. It's almost as though the blade is too wide for the handle.Here is a follow-up to my review: I ground down the offending corner on a grinding wheel, so that it no longer is sharp. This should have been done in the manufacturing process."
5,perfect,knife is small is exactly what i was looking for in a knife and folds out with out a problem unlike some knifes that snap back into place and fear of cutting your hand.
4,"Its a CASE made in the USA,","Excellent little knife the only thing missing is a lock but other than that its excellent. I ended up with 2 I got one and I misplaced it, I went out and got me another one. Couple of days later found the misplaced one, now I got 2 and thats great you can never have to many knives. Easy to get a sharp edge, old fashioned nice look. This knife would be the knife my grandfather would use. Classic, functional, light, great utility knife. Now I want the one with the yellow handle."
1,It has been over three days and the order still has not shipped,"It has been over three days and my order still has not shipped. I don't want to wait for two weeks and find out this is not coming at all, it is a Christmas present and I don't want to be scrambling at the last minute to try and find it. When will it ship?????"
2,Kinda Weak,"Sorry, while I enjoy reading about Jeff Talbot I think that The Marriage Casket is a really weak read. Sorry, I'll stick with the more popular authors when it comes to mystery."
2,Short 5-7 page stories of adventures at sea.,"This book is a quick read. It consists of many short stories of adventures at sea. Some are pretty good, some are not. If you like sea stories ( I do ) you'll find this book lacking. My son, who is not an avid reader, liked the shortness of each story and eventually read the whole book. If you like to read in short spurts, you'll like this book."
5,Awesome CD -- Wire's 3rd incarnation begins!,"People credit the Beatles with being the most creative, most transformative band out there, but for me and and a small group of others who have been lucky enough to bump into them, that band is definitely Wire! These four musicians have been to every corner of the sonic universe, and this time they've surfaced with six very catchy and raw combinations of technology and traditional punk energy. Seriously, if you consider music an art form and you want to go on a truly amazing journey, buy Wire's Pink Flag, 154, Chairs Missing, The Ideal Copy, The First Letter, Read & Burn, Colin Newman's A-Z, Graham Lewis' HALO, Bruce Gilbert's Shivering Man, and one of the Dome CDs -- you won't regret it!"
4,the album wire fans have waited for 20 years late,"When Wire resurfaced in the late eighties many of their die hard fans I imagine where hoping for a pink flag/chairs missing type lp. Snakedrill the ep sort of fell along those lines but the lp, Ideal Copy was anything but punk(still a good release just the same).Now much more than a decade later i have just heard read and burn and though its not the sparse raw sound of pink flag its much closer to their early punk sound than the eighties syrupy gloop that followed ideal copy. R&B; is solid if simple. I am reminded of early pixies, Chrome and other eighties post punk punks.Any fans should not be disappointed (as manscape and bell is a cup did for me) but not blown away either.However in a way this could be considered a concept album as here these guys are considerably over the hill thrashing away. Once again Wire is doing what they are not supposed to be doing."
3,"Well, it's new Wire...","Let me start by saying I am one of the Worlds biggest Wire-o-philes... I have seen them on tour 3 times now going back to ""Bell is a Cup"". ""I celebrate their entire catalog"" back to Pink Flag and Electric Ballroom, from Drill to Manscape. I am glad to see Read and Burn be a real Wire project and not another dinkee doink house / trance album or some other ""We hate the beat combo"" concept. So, on to the cd at hand. Well, it's ok, it rocks, sort of, and has neet beats and stuff. What has me baffled is, where are the chords? Each song on this disk has ONE chord, with Germ Ship maybe having two. I imagine this will be good live, and I am checking them out next month, but the cd had about a 2 day life span for me. I felt like I was visiting an old friend from high school, it was nice to see him, but listening to him go on about his new wife and kids was just kind of boring..."
1,Trophy Pack,"I find it very hard to rate a game as to how much fun it is when it locks up EVERY time its played. The company has no patch for it and I go on there message board I see I am not the only person complaining about this. The game was not that expensive but I feel all the bugs should be out of the system before it is but on the shelve for sale. It may be a great game if it ever runs properly, But for now Wizard Works Outdoors have dud for sale."
3,Biblical People & Ethnicity,"In terms of the history of settlement in the holy land the book does a good job of describing three groups, the Canaanites, the Philistines, and the Egyptians' influence. These groups are well described. If however you are looking for the Israelites in this volume you are going to have difficulty finding them. The author comes to the conclusion that Israel arose from existing Canaanite groups or a combination of Canaanites and transient immigrant groups. The book approaches the subject from a scientific and archeological perspective. The fact that early Israel was semi nomadic presents a problem for this approach because of limited fixed Israelite settlement, predating the period of the kings, available for excavation of archeological evidence."
2,"The ""Unknown"" Reality, Vol. 2: A Seth Book","Not really into this type of channeling. Only read a page or two and haven't pick it again and don't intend to.The ""Unknown"" Reality, Vol. 2: A Seth Book"
5,Seth books,"The Seth books and material are timeless and impart incredible wisdom. I read some of this information when I was 20 and I am now reading it at age 56 and finding this information to be just as worthwhile, even more worthwhile and fascinating than when I was younger.If you read these books....try to figure out just what type of being Seth is....He is not a ghost or an alien. He appears to be another type of being with incredible wisdom."
5,Great story...,"This is a great story and read very well. I got it for my husband, but we both listened to the book and enjoyed it very much."
4,KING OF THE WILD FRONTIER,"WHETHER THIS IS, AS IT CLAIMS TO BE, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THE LEGENDARY FRONTIERSMAN OR NOT (IT INCLUDES ENTRIES UP TO THE DAY BEFORE THE ALAMO FALLS!), IT IS AN ENTERTAINING NARRATIVE IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE TOLD AS THOUGH FROM FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE. CERTAINLY A GREAT AMOUNT OF RESEARCH WENT INTO THE BOOK, AND IT MAY VERY WELL BE THE AUTHENTIC ITEM WITH A ""GHOST"" (NO PUN INTENDED) WRITER SUPPLYING THE FINAL DETAILS. WELL WORTH THE TIME FOR ANYONE WHOSE INTEREST TRAVELS ALONG THESE LINES, BUT BE WARNED, THERE ARE SOME VIOLENT AND RACIAL DESCRIPTIONS THAT MAY OFFEND THE SENSETIVE. OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S A LOT OF FUN."
3,Bathroom reading?,"This book has a charming cover and wonderful printing. It makes a nice gift for young people (they'll probably keep it in the bathroom?). Ms. Padwa's writing style is engaging. In the introduction she says that although this book is not thorough, it ""has the facts you need to hold your head high"" -- that said, I was disappointed to read a few misguided ""facts"" within the book. Perhaps this is because she admitted to poring over books and articles but did not mention any conversations with actual people. And, with the number of contradictory books and articles on every subject, this method would have to produce somewhat flawed results. The flaws are annoying but forgivable, and since she writes as if she is having a pleasant conversation, I still open the book to random pages and read a bit from time to time."
1,Out dated!!,Started reading this book and found out that many subjects were just out dated. Never finished and passed it on.
2,Don't waste your time,I thought this book to be very boring. I'm pretty sure none of this information would ever come up in conversations.
4,"Not intended to be an authority of ""everything"". . .","This book doesn't pretend to be the end all be all of knowledge compedia. It's a relatively humorous look at some of the things that you may have fudged on in the passed and hoped you wouldn't get caught on. Roughly one in 120 people are allergic to peanuts. Fewer than 1/20th of that amount are allergic to MSG. Sorry, but it's a medical fact. N.E.J.M. Mar. 1998- If you want to read something humorous and mildly insightful, read this book. If you have serious concerns about allergies, see a doctor."
2,All Fluff,"Don't bother, if you are half inteligent, you should know everything that's in the book, just commonsense."
4,Great value,"I was a little apprehensive about purchasing this phonograph cartridge because the price was so low. In the days when I played LPs exclusively I used more high-end components, operating under the idea that you get what you pay for. Even so, I thought that I did not have much to lose by trying out this particular item. I was pleasantly surprised at the sound produced by this inexpensive wonder. It does the job very nicely and the resulting sound belies this cartridge's ridiculously low cost. Now that I have re-discovered some of the recorded gems I have in my extensive record collection, I will play records more and CDs less. I will also purchase a better phonograph cartridge, no disrespect intended. This particular Audio-Technica model has whetted my appetite for the good old days of soaring high-end analog sound. I will continue to enjoy it until I upgrade because now I can take my time."
5,Turntable purrs like a kitten.,"Wow - this stylus is fantastic. Easy to install and very affordable. There are more expensive units available but dollar-for-dollar this stylus provides exactly what my ""old school"" Technics SLBD1 needed to bring it back to life. So glad I bought this. The turntable is coupled with a Cambridge 540 pre-amp that runs through an older Pioneer Pro Logic tuner/receiver with Bose 301 speakers. Nothing too fancy but it sure delivers a full quality sound for the cost. Check it out, you'll be glad you did."
2,Weakness is in the Remote,"I got this for my 5-year old, and based on the reviews, I was really looking forward to it. We got it for her (yes, her) birthday in March and two months later, it has been rendered useless. The problem is in the remote...somehow, she dropped it and some little plastic piece on the door that holds the batteries in broke. After using glue, duct tape, and everything else I could think of, nothing would hold the door on so the batteries would stay in. Now I understand why some kids toys have a little screw on the battery door!!"
3,Probably OK for primary care,"This is a superficial guide to the musculoskeletal exam. It accomplishes its task of being a basic overview, but really lacks the depth that should be expected for anyone doing a thorough musculoskeletal examination. Even as a basic book, I don't think it is the best. Consider ""The 3 minute musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve exam"" pocketbook; personally, I think it is a lot better- though still fairly superficial."
2,Superficial,"I find the content quite superficial and incomplete. For example the chapter on shoulder pain does not make a distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic shoulder pain. Tips based on pain location are limited to distinguishing between rotator cuff tendinitis and bicipital tendinitis.About the kindle edition. The content does not seem fully digital. You can adjust font size and search the book, however, you cannot change the font face, and characters are poor quality. Images, are OK, but I would expect more from a digital edition."
1,Don't trust this book,"I have made it through two chapters, and already I have discovered two major factual errors. First, on page 7 neck extensors are described as innervated by the ventral cervical rami when, in fact, they are innervated by the dorsal cervical rami. This error is repeated in Chapter 1, table 2. Second, on page 31, the O'Brien test interpretation is described exactly opposite of the original description by O'Brien. A SLAP lesion gives pain in the pronated position, not the supinated position as described. Read with caution."
5,"Short, sweet, and focused","This book helped me focus my musculoskeletal exam and make it more effecient. It's a first rate book that ortho docs and GPs alike would benefit from using. GPs and ortho/pm&r/neuro residents may particuarly like the diagnostic work up and treatment sections, which most exam books don't have. I was turned onto this book by a colleague and I'm very grateful that I was. Not many people seem to be using it yet, and I hadn't heard of it, but it's a good find. Other books for musculoskeletal exam that are worth getting are Magee's Orthopedic Physical Assessment (which is a larger book written by a PT that could be used as a reference for various physical exam maneuvers) and, of course, Hoppenfeld's Physical Exam book. Hoppenfeld still sets the standard when it comes to anatomy and biomechanical review, which he weaves nicely into his physical exam."
5,"Well written, great pictures, very practical",This is the sort of book that I have been looking to use for years. It's an easy read. Very sensible. The pictures are first rate and make the physical exam easy to follow. It tells you what tests to order and what treatments are available. I also really appreciated the section explaining the differences between referred pain and radicular pain.
5,Overall very helpful,"I agree with some of the previous reviewer's remarks. I just got this book and found a few inaccuracies. However, I think overall it is a great resource to have for my rotations. It's easy to access the information I need. All the pictures of the tests are easy to follow and the written descriptions make it very clear to use even in between patients. I wouldn't make it my only physical exam book, but it's definitely one I prefer."
5,Best all around,"After trying several types of breastmilk storage bags, I was lucky enough to get my hands on the Gerber ones. They are AWESOME. They are easy to open, fill, seal, freeze, and use as a liner. Other bags are flimsy, and you will undoubltly have spills. With the Gerber bags, the zipper seal makes a nice rigid edge to hold the bag when filling. After filling these bags you are able to get all of the air out of the bag and seal it. After I filled the bags, I would lay them flat in the freezer, and when frozen nice and flat, they stood up nicely in our freezer or fridge. I used hundreds of these bags with my first child and I only had one spill, that was mosly in part of my black dog sleeping in the middle of the kitchen at night :)Hats off to these bags, they are easy to use, durable, and can be used in most disposable bottle systems with no problem."
1,DO NOT BUY! NOT SAFE!,"I stored breastmilk in these bags, and when I fed it to my child, he spit the bottle out! He was so upset even though he was hungry, I tasted the milk- it tasted like plastic! It was horrible! If the taste is leaching into the milk, imagine the chemicals that have as well! I don't believe this product is safe, DO NOT BUY!"
5,Great bags. Used them for 11 months.,I used this bags for a long time. They worked really well and never leaked. They also worked very well for freezing milk.
1,Worst Bags Ever,"I used 10 of these bags. Every single one leaked out of the bottom. I had one that I thought didn't leak, so I put it in the refrigerator. When I checked the next morning, the whole 5 ounces was gone. It was all over the refrigerator. I lost several ounces of milk due to these bags. My co worker told me they were so wonderful. But they are just going to make you lose your hard work. I use Lansinoh and out of the 300 plus bags, not one has leaked"
3,product was great.... box not so much,I ordered this box for a gift but after receiving it i was very disappointed. The bags were great but the box was crushed and falling apart. I wish I would have that the product had a defect.
1,Don't waste your milk on this product.,"These bags leak about 75% of the time when they are defrosting and have lost many ounces of milk. I now have to defrost into a bowl and then at least, I don't lose the milk. I have switched to Lansinoh bags and have had no problems."
3,storage bags,"These bags work fine for me. I've not had but a couple of leaks - slow drips I caught quickly. They just barely fit over my Playtex nurser bottles, but they're so versatile and a good price. I haven't wanted to go with anything else."
2,These bags leak!,"I tried these with my first baby. About one out of every 10 bags or so will leak out the top, where the seal is. (The seal only has 1 zipper at the top.) I moved on to the Lansinoh bags, which a) never leak; b) are made of a little bit better plastic (I think); c) have a double seal at the top of the bag. Get the Lansinoh bags; don't even bother with these unless you are in a pinch and this is the only brand of bag available at the store. My second baby has benefitted from Lansinoh milk storage. Even using the Target in-store brand plastic bottle liners to store my milk with a twist-tie on top didn't produce leaks!!"
2,Always used these bags,"I used these bags when I nursed my now-2-year-old and never had problems; I liked them the best out of all the bags I had tried. Now, however, I am using them with my 5-month-old and am having issues with leaking from the bottom seam! It is a horrible feeling to ""lose"" ounces of precious breastmilk because of unexpected leaking from the bag. I'm switching to Lansinoh bags."
1,HORRIBLE,This is the worst milk storage system you can use. At first I thought they were OK but they consistantly leaked. The medela bags and the Lansinoh bags are much better. The playtex One Step system is also very easy to use. DONT BUY THESE BAGS!!
1,terrible accents,"The singers on this cd are not native German speakers, and while they do a decent job for Americans, they do have very obvious American accents. To me one of the major benefits of buying an audio recording for children is so they can hear authentic accents. I'm glad I checked this out from the library before purchasing it so I would not waste my money. If you're going to bother to buy a recording to teach your child German, look for one where the people on the recording are native speakers so your kids can hear real German, not Americanized German."
5,Outstanding! Written for broad audience of potential users!,"I bought this book when I was particularly interested in continuous wavelet transforms. I found myself flying through the exposition. I felt confident about the knowledge I was acquiring and I was quickly able to apply it. Although I come at this book as a mathematician, I think that it is ideal for engineers and physical scientists who usually have far better grounding in signal processing and related issues in Fourier analysis than do mathematicians. I have recommended this book to students, friends and colleagues with high praise."
3,"Solid mathematical foundation, but not ""friendly"".","This book provides a solid mathematical foundation for wavelets, however the title (no doubt responsible for selling a lot of books) is extremely misleading. This book is ""friendly"" only if you have recently passed your Ph.D. qualifying exam in mathematical analysis. Nevertheless, advanced readers looking for a good overview of wavelets will find that material here."
3,Better than everage book on wavelet transform,"This book gives detailed explanations and derivations of wavelet transform. However, one tends to get lost on a vast number of formulations that are not really helpful for practical uses. If you just want to learn how to use wavelet transform to solve practical problems, this is not the book you should read."
3,This is not a friendly guide to wavelets,"I think this book is writen to be used by mathematicians and not by engineers , it has many equations and a few drawings,the mathematics are not complicated but it lacks a phisycal approach.I buy by mail and I get dissapointed when I received it."
5,Very didactic. A great textbook.,"The usefulness and success of a mathematics or otherwise technical book depends, more than on anything else, on it's level being tuned to the level of the reader. Whatever the subject one wants to learn, he must first go through a search of books on the subject to choose the ones that pick up things from where he left them.Now, it is also true that, given a certain technical level, there are books of varying quality.If you have had a course on linear algebra and some contact with infinite series and Fourrier series at undergraduate level, than this book is the ideal introduction to wavelets for you. It will take you by the hand and smoothly guide you through generalizations such as Hilbert spaces and Fourrier transforms before entering the title subject. It is clear and profusely illustrated by examples. It also benefits from a (for what I've seen) flawless edition work.Highly recommended."
2,dead microwave.,"we got this microwave last summer, and it died this morning. i saw a similar review online -- it doesn't heat anymore, you can hear that it no longer ""shifts"" over into heating/inverter status and the fan is the only thing running. then it shuts off after about 20-30 seconds, and i noticed a plastic-y, burning smell. we loved it up until now -- the sensor reheat and thaw functions were really great. too bad......."
1,Panasonic RIP (died today),Only a few years old. Would never heat uniformly. Edges of food were cooked but center was not fully cooked. Burned electrical smell and lots of smoke and I will not plug it back in to try it any further. Will not buy another Panasonic MW in the future.
2,microwave death,We bought this microwave less than 4 years ago. It died yesterday. My previous microwave lasted 20 years and was still working when we sent it to e-cycle.
4,Good title but disappointing,"Although the coverage of XML is good, I found myself needing much more information especially in light of moving to web services technology. I found Java, The Complete Reference combined with this title as a good blend to get me where I needed to be."
2,not enough for a developer,"First of all, it is out of date.And, it is not enough for a developer to learn how to use XML in J2EE environment. Yes, it does have some sample code, but not enough."
3,God's Mission,"When obedient to God, even the smallest members of His Kingdom can do great things. This is written as a children's book and a good book for missionaries. Briscoe does a good job in tying together several different journeys all for God's grand plan.However, I am concerned about what age this is intended. There are several references to gory violence. ""... splattering bloody bits of people onto the ground! ... Screams from their family and friends rang from the crowd. Blood was everywhere."" (p.82) This is not an integral part of the story and wasn't needed. In fact, it seems very strange this reference would be in a Christian children's book. I wonder what she was thinking. I'm not planning on reading this to my daughter."
4,Amazing!,"The book seemed well researched. I justwondered how all that could happen. It appearsto me probably most of those people were not actuallyNative American, but Black and White.Seemed to me the powers that be did not do theirdue diligence when granting all those benefits to peoplewho were probably not even Native American. What a scam!!"
2,A Tendentious Book,"Evidently the Pequots didn't speak with this guy. I can see why. The book is really tendentious. I'd suggest instead ""Hitting The Jackpot"" by a former Washington Post reporter. I heard about it in the local newspaper and it's very good. Much more informed and balanced and powerful. Whichever book you like, get educated on this!"
2,Politics Skews intent and accuracy as well as money,"I hope that as readers of this book people might venture into doing research on of their own before taking the word of a man that was trying to get ""funded"" by a White Casino Owner in an area close enough to be affected by Fox Wood, and was trying to run for Governor?"
4,Not a Graphic Novel,"I bought this thinking it was a graphic novel, after enjoying Blue Monday and Scooter Girl.It's not. Just a novel.Caveat Emptor."
5,Jamie Rich -- the next big name in fiction,"I just put down this book and had to drop a few lines. Jamie is one of those rare writers able to bring truly original definition to characters and their relationships. You don't observe his world, you enter it, walk its streets, TASTE its dimensions (and boy are there a lot of 'em). It felt as though I was stealing conversations from the characters, rather than reading them.By all means, pick up 'Cut My Hair'. You won't be disappointed. Jamie is a rare talent. Bravo."
5,Superb Sound,"If the selections are what you want (they are all originals, not covers), you can't go wrong here. The sound quality is superb."
3,disappointing,"I admire all 3 musicians on this disc. Not sure what went wrong but there is just no life in the music. For a much better listening experience, see Lagrene's duets with Sylvain Luc, Vitous's collaborations with Philippe Petit and Antonio Farao, and also the excellent Coryell/Vitous quartet record"
4,The Complexity of Modern War,"This is a solid read for those interested in the complexity of modern warfare. Ballard offers the reader a view of how an American force can address the tough issue of fighting in a built-up area. While he provides a superb recount of the timeless requirement of tenacious fighting by small groups of brave infantry and armor forces, he also describes the myriad of tasks that a modern commander must consider in such an endeavor-civil affairs, information operations, and the list goes on. A good read for professional warfighters and those interested in knowing the challenges that our men and women are facing in today's battlefield."
3,Satisfying overview,"This is a good intro to the attack and taking of Fallujah in 2004. It is not a blow by blow, house to house battle read, but is a good way to introduce the operation. A wee bit sloppy with editing in some places, somewhat dry writing, a poor index and too many needless acronyms make this book 3 not 4 stars."
5,Price inflation,"I do not know what this guy is thinking asking $500.00 for this toy, it is not even the original. You can get this same toy on ebay for $40.00, and an original for less than this."
5,OMG!,I bought this when it came out and played with it in my swimming pool! If its going for this price now...??? also the original toy from the 60's had a rubber lined suit that you could inflate with the divers air hose so he would rise to the surface (I have one) this reproduction did not and the helmet is redesigned and does not fit properly.
4,Good game/more forgiving than real hunting,"As a regular upland game bird hunter I decided to buy this game because it was the only game out there that had upland bird hunting in it. I expected shooting the birds to be like real hunting, where its impossible to shoot it once the bird gets out there about 70 yards. However, if soon realized that in this game I was making regular hits at 100+ yards with a cylinder choke! I mean come on, that is impossible. I think that the software engineers are just trying to make it easier so that more people will buy it.Overall, the game is very good. The game birds are accurate in their appearance and their habits, and the guns are what you would really use when bird hunting. The reason I gave this game a four was for the lack of the shooting realism as stated above."
3,"Good, but with problems","I really enjoy the duck hunting and the turkey hunting, but hunting doves and quail is extremely frustrating. EVERY SINGLE TIME I try to hunt them, the game shuts down on me. It works fine until a bird starts flying away, but after that it completely shuts down. I have no idea why and if any of you can help me with this, I would like that."
1,This game is one of the worst games ever.,This game is to slow. It is really jerky when you are trying to shoot a bird. And also you cant get chocolate labs on the game.
3,For those who aren't afraid of swiming,"Forn, as his contemporarys-frinds Argentine writers, deconstructs ( fictionaly ) his novelistic and fantastically rich in storys third-world-dimension country with a sober but strength style. As Fresan's, Saccomano's and company, his work seems, as first sight, colosal, almost imposible. Too many stories floating in this urban south sky and a carreer starting are the necesary ingredients for a good literary production. Nadar de noche is a compound of various short stories where, from a surrealistic flight with a no.. ( monja ) to a party where a city godess blews everybodys mind, can be posible."
3,"Very mellow, dreamy. Give it a try.","This is a low-key album that produces a calming effect. ""On and On"" is a standout track and received a lot of play on XM Radio's Loft. The backup singer, whoever he or she is, has a powerful voice. It's a great contrast to the almost mumbled, soft vocals of the lead singer. Overall the music reminds me of The Sea and Cake's mellower tracks, but without the loopy, Jerry Garcia-esque riffs. Mission's Web site also compares the band to Iron & Wine and Nick Drake. I can see a bit of Nick Drake, particularly his darker ""Pink Moon"" stuff."
3,Bit of a disappointment,"If you are a P.D.James fan, skip this one. The acting is good but the adaptation of the original story is disappointing. Some extra business about drug traffic and international intrique has been added for what purpose it's hard to see as it adds nothing to the plot. Roy Marsden makes a adequate Dalgleish but I thought Mel Martin was miscast as Deboral Briscoe."
4,Super country rock,"I bought this on the cheap, unheard, having been a Poco fan. I was FLOORED by the musicianship, harmonies, and writing [I already knew Furay's vocal prowess]! These guys were clearly on their game--how they couldn't have made it big--but the Eagles did--is a mystery. My favorite--Fallin' in Love-- MORE than rewarded me for the cost. Heartbreaker, Border Town, and Safe at Home are gems, to me. If you like Eagles, the adult Rick Nelson, Poco, and Buffalo Springfield, add this to your collection! These guys are great!"
3,Souther Hilman Furay Band,"Country based rock performed by these muscians was the style that led to so many southern rock and country music acts to follow. Not the best of JD Southers offerings, but allows the listener to hear Three good singer songwriters together performing their early music."
3,"Great Music, Not So Great Mastering","I had the original album and actually got to see these guys play at Penn State in late '74. I bought the Wounded Bird CD because I remembered enjoying the LP -- very much. Perhaps my memory is tricking me into thinking that the LP sounded better than this. And as I listen to this now, I can imagine that there has got to be a better master out there to do it right. Oh Well. So it is 5 stars for the music -- fortunately my feeling on that has not changed. I give it one star for the mastering. That averages out the three stars. Since this one is not on anyone's must have list, I guess this is as good as it will ever get."
4,My Number One Sneakers,"These sneakers are exteremly comfortable. I wear them almost everytime I am going to town. The reason why I am giving them a four star rating is because when i first got them, the elastic was bit too tight for my foot to enter in. So I cut out three of the elastic and put in a shoe lace instead. So now I have no complains."
3,The Jury is still out.,"I bought the CLC bucket organizer at the same time. So far I've taken a liking to the bucket. I was a little surprised that this had a somewhat soft bottom, which tends to make heavy items slip under the adjustable partition. I'm sure in time I will find a use for it."
2,not for tool with any weight,"i'm in IT, audio, video and light. and like to have all my tool in eye sight. i have a husky bag that is like this one just a little smaller. the bottom of keeps wanting to push out and i have less weight in the bag them my smaller one."
3,Great idea...,"I love the idea of this... a bread board that catches the crumbs as you cut it. The execution isn't quite as great, but mostly because you can sometimes lose said crumbs as you transfer them to the garbage. That is mostly user error however. :) I would like to have seen a product like this in bamboo or another material but that is personal preference. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition."
3,you get what you pay for.,"the zbt is by far the cheapest line of zildjians. and this cymbal definately lives up to that statement- the sound is surprisingly alright- its quite explosive, and it has a very short decay. the huge problem i have with all the zbts, they break in less than about 5 monthes. this 14 inch crash, and even with the correct cymbal hitting technique, cracked complettely within 2 monthes. still you get what you paid for. i wouldnt reccomend buying this cymbal."
1,worst cymbal i have ever owned,"i went through 2 in about 5 months but the 18 inch crash ride wen used as a ride cymbal has lasted me about a year and a half with only 1 small crack that hasnt grew and my hi-hats still sound that same way as when i took them out of the box same with m 16 inch zbt crash.....the only cymbal from the zbt line i hate is the 14"" if u want a good cymbal for a cheap price buy the 16"" the 14 "" failed miserably"
4,Feedback,Item received in excellent order and survived the Christmas mailing. The information relating to the DVD allowed buyer to make informed decision whether suitable or not.
1,Never again,"This came several weeks late. Also, it kind of looks like it was printed with a low quality printer. There are lines."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!,I just put this on for my 11 month old grandon as he has decided to chew up the crib :). He LOVES it! He has not offered to pull it off as teething on this WAY better than the rail! Thank goodness! I have not hung the toys on it... thought this may lead to him wanting to pull at it... but I may use them in the future.. for now he uses those to chew on as well works GREAT!... it could stand to be about 1-2 inches longer... but I am WELL satisfied... so much so that I just purchased another for the back rail! Thanks!!!
3,Works well on thin crib rails,"The product looks nice and is functional, but we have a wide crib rail and it barely velcros at the bottom. I have to adjust it whenever I get him out of his crib. I don't have any teether toys on it because I know my son would begin to pull on them and cause the entire cover to come off. I believe safety pins would work to hold it on, but I'm afraid to try them. This product would work really well on a standard crib rail, but it's only passable on wider crib rails."
4,works great,I used this to grind down some uneven concrete wall surfaces and it worked really well. Didn't last quite as long as I had hoped.
5,History in my hands,"I ordered this because as a member of the Devilicious Show Choir at MVSU, we performed excerpts. It was a great movement."
2,A Mediocre Low Budget Film,"With a name like ""Dangerous Curves"" you'd think that this would be some type of soft-porn, skinamax movie. Despite what it's title suggests, this movie shows no t&a, just some male gentalia in a jar to give it a ""not-for-rent-to-under-18"" status. With a bigger budget this movie might have been decent, but the terrible special effects and the somewhat baffling plot lend it to mediocre status. The plot tries to add a lesbian element to allure adolescent teenagers, but I'm sure that they will be entirely disappointed with the film. There is not many good things you can say about this film. The ""lawyer who gets too involved with a client"" theme is not solidly established. As the plot revolves around this theme, the overall performance is weak, and character development is poor. As bad as this film is, it does keep you watching to wait for when it is going to get better. By far not the worse movie I've seen. I give it a C overall."
5,replacement blades,These did not fit my dog clippers but my sale was fast and easy and returns were a breeze..thank you no problems
4,Great Book For The Novice Or Intermediate Bassist,"This book will be a wonderful tool for the bassist who is just beginning to learn his/her instrument or the more experienced player who would like to explore their options. The theoretical and instructional section is as comprehensive as is possible for those without the benefit of an instructor as well as being easy to understand. The section covering equipment will serve well as a guide to those of us with just enough information to make ourselves look very foolish. The section on notable bassists and the recommended listening list stands as a veritable ""who's who"" of my own personal heros. (Where's Patitucci?!) I will highly recommend this book."
4,An enjoyable overview,"If you like reading Bass Player magazine (I do), you'll probably like this. Lots of information without the ads, many articles I've gone back to multiple times."
4,Great for beginners,"Since im a beginner, i liked these alot. They sure can take a beating too. I've had them for 5 months and i bought them used and they are still in alright condition. Im getting z custom dyno beat hihats to replace them but i like them still i am still going to use them.Also, compared to Sabian b8 14 hats, i liked the ZBTs better. So if your a beginner on a budget, these are the hi-hats for you. You wont be disappointed."
1,Noise,"I love Catalani, but this 2-CD set is so amazingly noisy from stage movement and overly-enthusiastic audience that I find it difficult to listen to. Live performance was recorded in September, 1985. Libretto is in Italian and sloppy broken-English. Too bad!"
2,Comments: Dewalt DW9072 12.0 volt Compact NiCd Battery Pack,"COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS ON THE DW 9072 BATTERY PACKS.As a Licensed contractor,I am offering this info as a support for your store.The 9072 12 volt battery listed is not a good buy as there are2 types of batteries in this catogory available.The 9071 is the same battery but has an Extended Run Time.The 9071 cost [$$$] each new at Dewalt storesThe 9072 cost [$$$] new and does not have Extended Run Time.If you would like more info on this let me know..."
3,unsure,my husband was very disappointed at first. He said the battery wouldn't hold a charge. He charge for several days and it seems to be okay now. Will probably go to Home Depot for the next one.
2,Not very useful for me,"Unfortunately this book is set out for students that learn by discipline, not system. Ie they give tips for studying anatomy as a stand-alone subject, but my med school teached by body system.It might be helpful for others, but I didn't get much out of it."
4,another missing song,"I have only seen the flick once, although I dearly loved it. I can't say for sure, but for some reason I think I heard The White Stripes excellent ""We're Going to be Friends"". Can anyone verify this? When I first bought the White Stripes album I just knew that I had heard the song, and only this morning did it dawn on my it was probably from the Royal Tenenbaums. Specifically, when the 2 grandsons are hanging with Royal and getting to know each other and doing kid stuff."
5,One of the best soundtracks,The Royal Tenenbaums has been one of the best films of the year and it definitly has the soundtrack to match. I had to see the film in a large city because it hasn't reached my small town yet and this soundtrack is feeding my appetite until I see it again. This music is unbelievably interwoven into the film and I have been able to relive it over and over again just be listening to the CD. Nick Drake's FLY has become one of my favorite songs and Mark Mothersbaugh's score is brilliant. Every lover of the film must have this soundtrack.
3,Too much missing...,"There's Great stuff here, but way too much missing. Stones, Simon and Morrison music in the film are WAY TOO IMPORTANT to have been left off this soundtrack cd. I'm sure it had everything to do with the cost of securing the songs rights. Too bad.What made it to disc is great fun and well worth the used price here at Amazon. Go ahead and get this disc, you won't be disappointed. That is unless you're like me and really need those missing songs to complete the ""feel"" of the movie through the soundtrack.By the way, I slugged through about 40 of the 70+ reviews here and didn't fine a one review to correctly identify the Ysaye Quartet performance as Ravel's String Quartet in F. Just an FYI."
4,Help trying to figure out the title of a song,"Hey, maybe you guys can help me, does anyone know the title of the song playing on a radio while owen wilson is getting high (or preparing to do so) with his friends and his dad and brother step in and tell him they want to help him. I really love that song and i have no idea what the title is"
3,Too much Mothersbaugh,"This soundtrack indeed suffers from the same problem as the Rushmore CD: too much filler taken from the ""score"" by Mark Mothersbaugh. What's great about the movie's music is the memorable selection and placement of pop, jazz, and classical songs. I don't remember a single Mothersbaugh melody from the movie, and that is how it should be. His music should support the scenes without being noticed. It is not possible to ignore the tracks from other artists; that's why they are placed against the scenes."
4,Solid compilation.,"The soundtrack compliments the scenes in the movie unbelievably well. I think it would be better for you to watch the movie before you buy the soundtrack because then the songs are even more reminiscent of the movie. The three guys (including Wes Anderson) who worked on the soundtrack did a great job because now when I hear songs from the sdtrk I don't think ""Hey, it's the Ramones/Nico/etc."", it's more like ""The Royal Tenenbaums!"".However, like other albums, it gets a bit tiring after a lot of listens...it's still a good buy though."
2,Glaring Omissions,"This soundtrack suffers from the same problems as the Rushmore soundtrack: glaring omissions. Where are the Stones? Don't get me wrong - there are some great tracks on here, and I love the fact that they include Mark Mothersbaugh's (see Devo) great score songs. Wes A.'s movies are so strong in their use of music, but the soundtracks seem to leave key songs out. Maybe they can't get the rights of these songs for inclusion on th CD, or maybe there's not enough room on 1 CD for all of the songs, but if it's the latter, I think most would agree that they'd still buy the soundtrack if it were a double CD.Still . . . . . . I'll buy it anyway."
5,Well done,"I'm not someone who goes on and on about things the way some reviewers do - but I just wanted to say that this is one of the most enjoyable soundtracks I've ever owned, apart from Rushmore, which is another artfully put together compilation of songs. It's easy to let the whole thing play through, instead of skipping around the disc like I normally do. I don't mind the fact that some songs which appeared in the movie have been omitted on the disc. To me, that will make viewing the dvd (which I'm sure to buy when the time comes) all the more enjoyable!"
1,The Royal Tenenbaums Soundtrack,"The Collector's Edition Soundtrack leaves out two great Rolling Stones' tunes She Smiled Sweetly & Ruby Tuesday. Also left to the winds is John Lennon's Look at Me, the Clash's Rock the Kazbah. The First Edition leaves a few tunes off too but it is a far better Soundtrack. Puckstar"
5,"Great Film, Great Soundtrack","The first few times I started listening to this album I first thought of the movie and I would try to remember which song went with which scene. But as I listened to the CD in my Walkman over and over and over again, I began to really experience each song for itself, and I began to forget about its place in the film. Each song is so beautiful and has its own lovely personality, that you begin to fall in love with each song and the album as whole. Now I feel as though I can appreciate the film a lot more."
4,a laid-back sound for an awesome movie,"A soft-sounding awesome laid-back soundtrack for an amazing movie - a mix of Nick Drake, Elliot Smith, and a great instrumental of Hey Jude. Love it!"
1,SHAM: New Package Old Software,"I feel like ive been ripped off. This software is supposed to be new but it is a bundle of titles I purchased back in 1999 (human 3d reference edition and interctive human body). Infact two of the programs OurBody and Human 3D are the SAME thing with a slightly different interface. This thing is a sham, DONT FALL FOR IT."
5,Best bang for your buck,"I researched reviews all over before I decided to buy these bags a year ago. I loved the longer straps (others didn't) because when you stuff the bag full there is still room to throw them over your shoulder. These bags hold so much! I bought 6 bags and rarely take them all for a major shopping trip, if you're a big family I would recommend a couple more. These are also much bigger than the recyclable bags that Wal-mart, Target or your local grocery store sells. I completely recommend these bags!!"
4,Worth every penny!,"I am a big fan of getting rid of plastic grocery bags. After hearing that the bags sold in the grocery stores for .99 contained lead, I looked for an alternative....and here we are. I do wish the bottom of the bag was a bit larger, though. They are extremely durable - I have put more in this bag than I can even lift! I love the fact that I can just throw them in the wash when I need to! These bags will last a long time....."
4,Works Great,"The Bags are sturdy and should last a long time. They are not too big which I like because I don't like them too heavy. The long straps are good as I can put two on my shoulders and carry one if they aren't too heavy. I got tired of the flimsy ones I bought in the grocery store, they got holes in them after not too long. I haven't had these too long so hoping they will last a long time."
4,"wish they would have been in color, but great bags","These have been pretty useful not just for shopping, but for hauling things anywhere. I bought them after I saw a pretty interesting powerpoint on the damage that plastic bags are causing the environment. If I had it to do over though, I would have bought 3 larger bags rather than 6 smaller.. and I wish they would have come in color when I bought them (now they have the watercolor option)."
2,Nothing To Inspire Our Imagination,"Michael and Isabel were interesting characters, but the plot was just so weak and predictable. VERY predictable. At least give the readers something that resembles an actual thought process. Even the simplest things- we know Michael's going to knock at Isabel's door, we know as Isabel is walking down the road that Michael's going to pull up alongside her.The reader always knows what's going to happen next, which makes for a pretty boring book."
4,Engaging story with a good plot and resolution,"I enjoyed this story and read it quickly. While not perfect in several aspects, it was well written. I enjoyed the plot and characters and the development of the husband/wife relationship. The author also added a dose of morality which is often missing in Regency novels. Her love scenes were not so discriptive that they read like soft porn. I appreciated the author's use of forgiveness in the plot line. While not an inspirational novel, I found it inspiring. I would recommend this story for people who enjoy Regency novels but don't want to be loaded down with unrealistic sex scenes and bad language. Also, intimacy takes place within the bounds of marriage. How refreshing."
3,Good British Mystery,"Good Mystery performed by excellent British actors. It gets only 3 stars because of the awful audio. They must have found the original audio equipment used for ""The Jazz Singer."""
5,Lovely old tunes,"This album is a collection of old folk songs with messages, simply wrought and purely rendered. Jennifer Rose's voice is perfect, clear, round of tone and tender as fits a coffee house or a clear place around an evening campfire. Most of the accompaniment is guitar and dulcimer; all of the songs contain the unique combination of wistful tears and merriment that mark the Celtic roots of Appalachian American music. There are a couple of ""nonsense"" songs, just for the fun of it - good to remember how simple fun used to be. This music makes you feel as if you are part of the mountains, part of the story, and dares you to sing along."
4,Choo-choose Macias' Writing Book,"The Train of Thought Writing Book: Practical, User-Friendly Help for Beginning Writers lives up to its sub-title as a practical primer on how to write a book. Kathi Macias, published in a number of genres, will get you on the right track with these easy-to-follow steps. She even includes a character questionnaire in Chapter 6. Anyone who has ever seriously thought about writing a book should choo-choose Macias' writing book.-- Christine Kohler, Words Alive! Christian Writers' Prompts & Skills[....]"
4,Another good Crusie romance book.,"This is the fourth book that I've read by Jennifer Crusie, and I've enjoyed them all. ""Manhunting"" centers on the life of a woman named Kate, who is in her thirties, and desperate to get married. After three failed engagements, she and her friend, Jessie, decide to come up with a ""plan."" This plan involves the qualifications that any man must possess, in order for Kate to take an interest in him. During August, Kate decides to take a vacation at a resort in Kentucky, where she plans on meeting her future husband. She dates several men, but each date ends in disaster. Depressed that she is not meeting anyone who fits the plan, Kate thinks her chances of getting married are slim to none, until she finally takes a look around her, and sees that, sometimes, the person that best suits you is right under your nose."
4,"Predictable, but a light read","Personally I love reading Jennifer Crusie because she makes my summers enjoyable. I read Manhunting yesterday while floating on my pool enjoying the sun. It was a great quick read, and it is predictable, but it's a love story... what do you expect? Her books cheer me up because they're a quick escape from the real world, however ""chick lit"" it is. Manhunting was cute and I would recommend it."
3,Funny and Romantic,This is an unashamedly romantic and sexy book that is great summer reading. The plot is somewhat predictable but the characters are very lovable and you just have to read on to make sure that everything turns out just fine all around at the end.
1,The book was awful,"I read this on a whim, so I must preface by saying I usually don't read ""chick lit"". However, that aside, this book was awful simply from a literary point of view. The whole Kate keeps hurting/killing men thing was very weak. The plot points are not very well drawn out with each scene of her ""manhunting"" being a short vignette. This is supposed to be the center focus of the book and each one was a ""oh yeah, this guy fell in the pool, this guy did this, this guy did that."" No development. Also, the characters know each other for less than a month (I believe it was two weeks) and then get into fights about how much they love each other. I am a romantic at heart, but this seemed mellow dramatic and silly to me.All in all, I did not like this book. I found myself yelling at it ""you've known each other two weeks"". Too dramatic with absolutely no character or plot development."
2,I couldnt read it...,I couldn't get past the first two chapters it was your typical the hero and heroine hate each other on site. I could tell where the book was going to go. I was rolling my eyes it was way too typical. I do like the plot as far as her going to a high class resort to meet guys. You dont see that too often in romance novels. I still like Jennifer Crusie though.
3,"Not so bad, although she wrote better ones","I started J. Crusie with ""Welcome to Temptation"" and I LOVE it. I therefore decided to try some other ones. Manhunting was the 1st of those. It is good (especially the ""declaration scene"") but it is a little bit lacking. Lacking of what? Probably of story and probably because it was one of her first one (I think). But the good stuff in Crusie's books is emerging here : friendship between the future lovers, funny dialogs and sexy love affair.Let's say that it's worth reading but it's better to start with this one!"
4,Good Sunday read,Nice quick read. Cute story and characters. Being that it was out in 93 I would say this story is timeless.
4,A Cute Book for Crusie Lovers,"While not matching the standards set by her later books (Tell Me Lies, Crazy for You, Welcome to Temptation), this is a fun and fast read. The characters are the type you've come to love if you've read other Crusie books, funny, charming, and flawed. The secondary characters aren't as fleshed out as in later books, and the book suffers for it. Plus, I like the touch of suspense that Crusie adds to her later books - this is a straight romance. All in all - if you've not read Crusie before, start with one of her other books. If you have read her other works, you'll enjoy this one too."
5,Fun light romance,"Really good for this genre-- light romance. Likable characters. Humerous.I read this at a perfect time-- on an airplane that got diverted due to bad weather.It was perfect because the book kept me occupied and happy and was light and fast reading so I did not have to concentrate very hard.I laughed out loud several times while reading it! Excellent mood-lifter when on a bumpy delayed plane ride!Length was perfect too--I finished the book as we landed at our final destination (about 4 hours after take-off).I have read several of this authors later books-- and this is my favorite so far! (Though I am partial to the dog Fred in another fun romance by this author, ""Anyone but You"")."
3,A good one but not her best one,"Man Hunting was my 2nd Crusie's book and, let's face it, my less prefered one so far. Some typical Crusie's stuff are here but it is not ... I would say, heavy enough!It is funny, the relationship between the two heroes is sexy and witty (or the other way round, as you please) but the frame of the story is too thin. The characters are pleasant but not built enough. The conclusion is happy but comes too fast.I haven't given up Crusie after this one, but I knew she could do better. I would recommend it to start with Crusie!"
1,dont waste your money,"This book stunk. It was obvious to anyone with half a brain who she was gonna fall in love with within the first few pages of reading, and the book wasnt witty or funny at all. Waste of money."
3,A good chick-lit to read quickly.,"Jennifer Crusie books are typical romance chick-lit. This book had no exceptions to being typical. But I did find it to be an enjoyable quick read.This book was a ebook library borrow. I would maybe by a used paperback version of this, but not the ebook price.Kate Svenson's character is sometimes annoying but she acknowledges these faults and tries to fix them. The hero - Jake Templeton, is your typical care-free and anti-relationship kind of guy. The interactions between the two is cute and pleasant to read.All in all this was a good romance to read if you're in-between better fiction literature books."
1,heel guards,very poor quality no decals like shown on the picture (CANNOT) be used with factory heel guards like shown in the picture ill never order from this place again!!!!!!
4,The useful book of public relations,I like this book too much so I purchse it for the second time. This is true
3,One of Mascagni's best operas,"After Iris (1898) and Le Maschere (1901), Isabeau (1911) is the third opera by Mascagni to be written on a libretto by Luigi Illica. The music captures wonderfully the archaic atmosphere of the action, set in year 1200, and reveals once more the incredible versatility of Mascagni, who rarely said no to a musical challenge. Isabeau is a milestone in Mascagni's career and prefigures in many ways his masterpiece, Parisina (1913).It is hard to recommend this particular recording due to the poor sound quality, which makes it difficult to appreciate the performance or the work itself. Marcella Pobbe and Pier Miranda Ferraro have recorded extensive excerpts of the opera, released on a Cetra CD, that will leave a more durable impression on the listener.Bongiovanni has also released in 2003 a complete performance of Isabeau conducted by Kees Bakels in the Netherlands in the 80s, that I recommend heartily because it does justice to the music."
2,3rd Rate Opera by 2nd Rate Composer: 1st Rate Disappointment,"I had read such wonderful things about this work in a couple of books, lamenting its disappearance from the repertory, lamenting the lack of sopranos with the voice to tackle it. Having heard the highlights from Iris, and the whole of Parisina I was expecting more of Mascagni's characteristic mix of Italian lyricism with Wagnerian gavitas and orchestration: what I got was something very very dull, utterly unmemorable. The singers are all undone by their roles to one degree or another, singing music that leaves your head the moment is is done. Parisina is much better (and it ain't all that great).No loss to the opera reportory, this. Avoid it."
4,Memories of many summers ago,"was great seeing this again and how video games were back then and Corinne Bohrer with her Valley Girl type accent,she later was Bobcat Goldthwaits GF in Police Academy 4 Citizens on Patrolalso great seeing Joe Don Baker also a great stage actor as wellbrought back some great memories and games i was great at back in those days, and they teams together"
4,Fun Flick For 80's Nostalgia,"This is a fun trip down memory lane if your in to the like totally awesome 80's,or the early days of gaming, the movie was not as good as I remembered it to be, its really goofy and cheesy, and was an independent movie even back then, but it did take me back to the days of the first arcades, when in my town at least, it was a really underground thing, the arcade close to my house was actually a nondescript door in a self storage lot, where you entered in to complete darkness except for the glow of the games lining the walls exposing the mass of paisty teens with mullets reeking of b.o. and herb. I was disappointed with the transfer or print quality with this one, I wish they had remastered it better, I don't think they made any effort at all, and extras would have been fun for this as well, but I doubt this will make it to Blu Ray and will probably be out of print in the next year, so I'll take what I can get."
3,Only for collectors,"Having heard about this film from some arcade game enthusiasts, I thought I'd give it a look. Well, the movie itself is amateurish and low budget, but I could see how a fan of arcade games would enjoy watching it. The story is kind of stupid and the acting is not Oscar worthy by any stretch of the imagination. There is a lot nudity, so depending on how you feel about that it could either make you want to watch it or not. Mainly, I just wanted to warn people that the picture quality is not very good. The picture is very soft, the colors are faded and it's very dark in some if not most scenes. The movie is presented in 4:3 format, not sure if it was ever in widescreen, but it's not here. There aren't really any extras to speak of either except for some trailers for other low budget movies I never heard of or have any interest in seeing. If it sounds like I'm steering you away from this one, I am, although I will say for the curious it's worth renting once, but not owning."
4,Good movie for those that like to play with their joystick,"This is a pretty funny movie that is great for guys who played with their joystick a lot in the 80s, like Booger."
2,less than 2 stars if you're not into 80s kitch - way less,"How bad is it? Well, the box art was changed from the origonal movie poster / pr material since the illustrator assigned to the project actually put in the word ""SUCKS"" right - next - to - the - title. It's right under it with the S's backwards. I guess he got away with it for all the VHS reissues because they thought it was just a reflection of the title. Guess they finally caught on, so now we have lame 80s clip art.Pitty. Truth in advertising would have been nice:[...]"
1,Embarrassed to have ordered it.,"I'm ashamed to have ordered this movie. Saw it as a kid. All I remembered was the video arcade and the gratuitous shots of breasts bouncing around while playing video games. Movie came up in conversation so I came to Amazon, which has everything, and ordered it.This movie has to rank as one of the worst ever. To give you an idea of how bad, think 80s, Southern California, Valley Girl, punk rocker, a computer nerd, and a fat guy who has to be at least 450lbs all dancing in a circle watching two women who have clearly seen better days bounce up and down while topless and playing a video game.There, I just saved you 86 minutes of your life and $13.49. Use the money to fund my psychotherapy classes, which I now need, after sitting through this trash 80s movie."
4,A real page turner!,"I read this book over a weekend because I just couldn't put it down until I found out ""who done it"". I especially enjoyed the illustration of the unique life of blacks in Silicon Valley - something few are familiar with or even realize exists."
5,A true suspense mystery!,"Local politics, murder, and family secrets make for a suspensful read from neophyte, Gayle Tiller. Written in the locale of San Jose and surrounding metros, this is a special treat for Bay Area residents and a great read for all. I can't wait for the next adventures of Jasmine Myers, P.I."
5,I LOVED IT!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""No One is Innocent"" ... I received the book approximately 7:00 p.m. one evening and finished it at 2:00 a.m. that morning. I couldn't put it down. It was exciting, suspenseful, and I just couldn't wait to see who done it! And ... I never did suspect the person who did it! I guess I should have paid more attention to the title of the book. I look forward to reading your next one!"
2,No Online Code,"Even though I purchased this textbook new, and the product description includes a summary of online resources, this book does not come with the online ""Quia"" code required by most intermediate Spanish classes. The code allows users to complete online workbook assignments for class. Standalone codes are sold for around $50 and are usually included with a new textbook."
2,Organization is not there!!,"This book was recommended to me by a professor in another college. I would have to say, I regret using it. It is not organized. The flow of material into topics is disjointed. If you take the pieces alone it is good, the material in the chapters is disconnected. Get a better curriculum flow with another text. I would recommend fuentes or a vista intermediate book for your personal or college use."
3,Atando Cabos,The Item was received in fairly good condition with only a few folded pages. The cover was slightly bent but other than that I received my item in good condition and promptly.
3,Atando cabos review,"This book is ok. It is mostly in spanish, even the explanations, and sometimes the lessons are not thorough enough to understand what they are talking about."
3,"Book Fine, Seller a Scam",Atando cabos: Curso intermedio de español (3rd Edition) (MySpanishLab Series)I tried to cancel my order and was still sent the book. The book was in good condition but when I tried to contact the seller about returning it he never replied back to my numerous e-mails-Which was all he gave to contact him. I would recommend this book but not recommend this seller.
1,ILLEGAL ITEMS,"Most of the items sold under this page are Instructor's edition, whicg are illegal to sell."
3,After a not so good start it had an ok ending,"I started this book last year (ugh!) but somehow it failed to grasp my attention in spite of its ""you will not let it down"" review on the back cover. The first half is just very slow and vague.Needless to say I finished reading two very interesting books and was in need for reading material so I decided to tackle this one yet again. I continued from where I left on and it was a bit slow until it actually became interesting, the story finally began to unravel and had a well kind of emotional ending.Unfortunately the end was beating around the bush just too long and left some lose ends. Nevertheless I finished it."
5,I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!!,"I GOT THIS CD IN THE MAIL TWO DAYS AGO AND HAVE LISTENED TO NOTHING ELSE SINCE THEN! IT'S GREAT. KIND OF A BLEND OF SWITCHBLADE SYMPHONY, EVANESSENCE AND DEPECHE MODE. MY FAVORITE SONG IS PROBABLY ""BLUE DRESS,"" A DEPECHE MODE COVER WRITTEN BY MARTIN GORE. (I AM LISTENING TO IT NOW!!!!)ALL OF THE OTHER SONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE BRILLIANT AS WELL! (YOU DON'T HAVE TO SKIP PAST A SINGLE ONE!)THE FEMALE VOICE OF THE BAND IS BOTH ETHEREAL AND STRONG/PASSIONATE. AT TIMES, SHE SPEAKS MORE THAN SINGS, AS THOUGH SHE IS RECITING POETRY.THE SONG TOPICS ARE DARK: DEATH, LOSS, SUFFERING, LONLINESS.... (EXPERIENCES ALMOST ALL OF US CAN RELATE TO). BUT IF YOU LIKE THAT KIND OF STUFF (LIKE ME), YOU WILL ADORE THIS CD. I WILL BE GIVING IT AS GIFTS TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS. I PREDICT THIS GROUP WILL BE A BIG HIT IN THE GOTH/INDUSTRIAL/DARKWAVE SCENES."
4,a delight to discover,"Hungry Lucy have such a unique take its truely admirable. This almost trip hop almost darkwave/new wave enigma has some very grand ideas. This album does lack in its production and sounds very ""home basement tape"" compared to anything with a large lable or heavy production and editing. The rookie feel can slightly dampen the honing to its insight for a charged critic. All that aside there is true and honest beauty to be found in this album. The improvements in quality and production are very well shown in their newest LP ""Glo"" and is much more professional sounding. While the undeniable lack of genre might not win large attention, those who like thier music raw and from the heart will truely find a significant and well deserved place in thier collection for Hungry Lucy.Definate highlights in clude the tracks ""Blue Dress"" (A cover of a song by Martin Gore of Depeche Mode), ""Grave"" and also ""Cover Me""."
5,Warmth flows from the` darkness,"This is the cd which should silence all those arguments as to the coldness and lack of emotion in electronica. Despite the darkness this cd shimmers with a warmth and depth of emotion almost ineffable. Is it the vocals ? The musical compositions ? or the acceptance of some universal darkness of existance as if pain shared is pain lessened -whatever, when brought into the light Hungry Lucy make the darkness shine."
5,Indepth understanding,"This book is chock full of good information for new designers needing to know more about the production side of the world. This book is a great reference and enlightened me on aspects I didn't even know I needed to know. I listen to David Blatner's ""InDesign Secrets podcasts"", and his humor and knowledge carry through in this book."
5,Great and Excellent sounding DVD! A must have!,"Don't be fooled by reviews that you have seen this stuff before. I have personally seen only about 5% of this footage before. A small amount of the footage has been seen on the 1988 theatrical release of IMAGINE, however, those parts are greatly expanded upon in this DVD. The sound is incredible to listen to in 5.1 surround sound especially with headphones on as I am listening to it now. It truly makes you feel as if you are hearing the CD for the first time and the video only makes you appreciate the songs even more. The only negative portion is when Lennon seems extremely impatient during the background vocals of OH YOKO. His temper is soaring and Phil Spector looks as if he would rather be somewhere else. However this is important to see because it shows that creating art is not an easy task and keeping your temper intact is a tough one to master even by this master. If you don't have this DVD you are missing an important link into knowing Lennon."
3,"Could have lived without seeing ""How do you sleep?""","Footage was great and gave good insight for the above average fan. However I was pretty angry to see the footage showing John recording ""how do you sleep?"" I wish that had been completely left out. It totally ruined my view on John, and shows him as being a very ugly person.John himself later regretted ever recording that song, and I'm sure would have protested it being on the DVD."
4,"Self conscious, dated, but still a treasure!","For those of us who were ""there"", this is a must have. It is definitely self indulgent, and the footage of John and Yoko cavorting around in various ""costumes"" is a bit much, but it is for these reasons that it is a treasure. This was a transitional time for Lennon, and youth and innocence are still in evidence. To watch him record and to remember his brilliance and his talent, along with his fair and mediocre work is really a treat. This is worth seeing, and for those who love to hate Yoko, this gives plenty of opportunity to do just that. I am more than pleased that I have made this an addition to my library. I know I'll watch it more than once, enjoying it each time I ee it."
3,Little Crafty Mini Sewing Machine,This little tiny machine is good for tiny little jobs but not at all for any big job. mine broke in a day because I tried to sew a pillow even with very thin material. I dont know if I would buy this product again but I might. I'm not saying its a good product but I'm not saying its a bad one eiter though. It really depends on what little job you have in mind.
1,Don't do it!!!!,"I should give this no stars, but mine didn't have as many problems as other people have said they have had. It can't take much, it doesn't do the job well, and the bobbins that they give you can't be re-wound with a different thread once you have used up what they gave you! I'm with the others: take your needle, batteries, and bobbin and throw the rest away! You will spend more time undoing the poor job of this machine than if you were to try to do the project by hand!"
1,Great idea but ...,"I bought this item a while ago thinking it would be great to do crafts w/ my very young niece or scrapbook items without lugging out my huge sewing machine. I paid $6 for it at a craft store, and I'm glad it wasn't more. I have yet to get a single stitch out of it. The Provo Craft FAQ site wasn't any more help than the instructions that were in the box. Shame, as the concept sounds great, but based on all the reviews I see online - this product falls seriously short of even poor at best."
2,Not an OEM product. Doesn't fit tool.,"I purchased two of these batteries for my DeWalt tool. From the vendor's description and picture, they appeared to be Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), which they are not.They are made by an unrecognizable manufacturer, and do not fit the tool or the charger without forcibly smashing them into place! Once smashed in, they seem to work very well, but I am concerned that they will break the tool and/or charger before too long.I cannot recommend this item."
4,Great power for low voltage battery!,"When I purchased the Dewalt drill that only used a 9.6v battery pack, I was wanting to buy a more powerful tool but they were out of the higher voltage drills and I had to have one that day so I got the 9.6v drill. And to my amazement, the drill has performed beautifully and after 4 years, the batteries are just now beginning to slow down and lose their life. I use the drill far more often than I thought I would and so far its been through the remodelling of our home, the rebuilding of a carriage house and the building of a large shop. And numerous other household uses. I am glad now that I got the drill that used the lower voltage battery simply because it does every thing I need it to do and seems to have as much power and long life as the larger, more bulky battery packs. I highly recommend this battery pack made by Dewalt!"
1,Chinese crap,"I'm only here due to this same exact battery that died on me. I have not used it very much. It came with 2 so the drill still works for now. I was not aware that both the drill and batteries were both ""MADE in CHINA"". When I bought the drill and battery, I thought I was buying an American product. I should have paid closer attention. Instead of buying a replacement battery, I'll look for a replacement drill, due to the rip off pricing of the DeWalt replacement batteries, with different brand Made in the USA, if that is possible. Does anyone know of such an animal ?"
4,Review of DEWALT 9.6 Volt Ni-Cad Battery,"The battery was delivered as promised. I immediately put it on my charger, gave it full charge, placed it in my drill and gave it a medium drilling session. It performed flawlessly. The drill acted like it was brand new (not fifteen years old) as it had been acting with the original batts. The product was a bit pricey; but that was not too surprising--so is everything else these days! If it will last like the originals--fifteen or more years. It will deserve 5 stars."
4,Old School - But still quite entertaining,"The cell-shaded (cartoon-style) graphics are comical and fun. The fun gameplay and integrated cut scenes along with the sound and the music make this game a classic. You will be forever hearing taunts like ""Where ARE you marshall!"" rolling around in your head after you play through this game.The Intelligence of the computer opponents is rather weak - and the game physics can be less than accurate, but the game is still lots of fun to play. For $10 or so you can have a great time with this LucasArts game - I recommend it if you have some time to kill - or have a lower-end machine that can't run some of today's graphic's intensive games."
4,Hard To Quit,"This is one of my first forays into the world of PC Gaming and both my Wife and I have gotten a lot of enjoyment from playing this Game. There are two problems. The first is, it's extremely difficult to stop playing once you have started and of course, this is not really a problem but actually speaks highly of the games ability to keep you interested enough to continue playing. The second and most important is, there are no instructions so it's very difficult to figure out what to do in any of the levels of play. Aside from that,we are happy with it and find it very enjoyable."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"This game is similar in quality to the other LucasArts FPS, ""Jedi Knight"". I bought this game at a clearance sale and I was surprised by how much fun this game is to play. If you like playing other FPSs like ""Quake 2"" and ""Shogo"" and are looking for something new, try this old game."
1,CHEESY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Rotten graphics and gameplay. Do not waste your time! I was dissapointed!!
4,Fun with great music,"This is a fun first person shooter set in a setting usually ignored in this style of game. The best part of it is the music. I say this as someone who usually turns off the music in all the PC games he plays, because it becomes distracting and annoying after a while. This game is different in that it has a soundtrack that sounds like a 60's western. I wish I could get the CD with just the music.The worst part about the game is that it is to short. Warning, the cut scenes in this game make not work properly on newer faster computers. On my computer all the cut scenes went by a super speed and the talking was mumbled because of it. If this doesn't bother you then get it particularly because it is cheap... since it is an older game."
4,A pretty decent game.,"Having owned this game since '98, I must say that Outlaws is a very interesting game. I have certainly collected a lot of Lucas Arts games since then, and they've always been a hoot to play. Although the graphics may be classified as ""cheap"" by today's standards, I still enjoy this game. Fun 1st person shooter that ""traps"" you in the wild west. Giddy up, partner! You'd better track down yerself a copy of ""Outlaws"" for the PC. 4/5."
4,This is a great book!!!,"I was captivated by this book. The cover caught my eye immediately and from the very first page I was hooked. Could not put it down. This book will lift your spirits and brighten your day. Reading it was immensely enjoyable and I was so sorry when I was finished. I could just picture this beautiful old house and almost feel as though I was there with the occupants. I finished reading it several weeks ago and still find myself thinking about it. I commend Selma Sullivan on her first novel, and will be looking forward to more books by her."
4,"Excellent book, got me through the class","This is an excellent book on Sedimentology and Stratigraphy. My undergraduate program does not have an ""intro to"" Sed & Strat class, and the professor that teaches Sedimentology and Stratigraphy is pompous and impersonable. This book got nearly my entire class through the course, because we had no professor to really teach us anything. The pictures are excellent and the text breaks down difficult concepts in a way that is easy to understand. Additionally, the author is good at tying concepts from historical geology and structural geology into the text without over-burdening or distracting the reader. To any student looking to supplement a difficult class, this text is for. My one complaint is the price, it is rather expensive for a soft cover book. On a side note, this is now the field I work in and I keep this book with me!"
5,great condition,"So just like the title of this review, this book came in great condition, I don't know what else to say but I'm happy with my book?!"
3,Wish I was there!!,"This is a charming accounting of Captain de Groot's chartering years in the Caribbean. He not only discusses the ins and outs of the buisness, but gives the reader appreciation for the difficulties of networking with each island governed separatedly. The Captain clearly has a gift with people as he is exceptional with interfacing with all kinds of people and in all kinds of situations."
5,Far beyond my expectations,"I am not a boating person and especially not all that interested in auto biographies. Initially I bought this as a present for a nautical minded friend. Before stuffing it in wrapping paper I decided to read a few pages and bingo, I was hooked! I could not put it down! This book contains anecdotes, true stories, of the author's escapades while operating a charter yacht in the Caribbean. It is said that truth can be more exciting than fiction, that certainly is the case here. The stories are fascinating, funny and delightful. The author is a spell binding story teller and I am outrageously jealous of his life style. The book ends with ""to be continued"". I'll be first in line to buy the next one, land lubber or not!"
5,"Kathy Griffin, you are GOD!!","Irreverence and sarcasm have never been so embraced as they are with Kathy Griffin. A Goddess of sarcasm, she bulldozes through life without a care. She speaks the truth. Who knew the truth could be so funny? I love you, Kathy and your potty mouth. Thanks for the nasty little evil giggles!"
5,"D-List, Yet Absolutely Fabulous!","Kathy Griffin, whom I have met on several occasions, takes the D-List to an all new level of fun, gossip, celebrity and excitment! She tells HOLLYWOOD that she is here, and here to stay! This action-packed season 3 is full of outtakes, assistant blogs from Jessica, Tom and Tiffany, all the while loaded with bonus features that make this season worth buying! Kathy Griffin continues to make her fans laugh as we all cheer her on in whatever path she takes in her crazy life; she makes the D-List seem like not such a bad place afterall! XOXO"
1,"Boorish, Vulgar, Irrelevant",Griffin reminds me of a boxer that fights one too many times and is rendered brain damaged.Complete waste of money and time.
2,case does not fit the phone,unfortunatly the case does not fit the phone .. the phone is square and the case is rounded and phone wont fit
4,**3.5 STARS**,"I've been reading quite a bit about Jack Russells lately for my JRT book review website and I have to say that most of the books are pretty good and cover the same basic information. Things like how to choose a pup, how to puppy-proof your home, and the basics of healthcare.Where Ms. Pavia's book differs is that it offers some information about dog body-language as well as some good ideas about exercise regimes. She also uses the most negative language about Jacks that I've run across. And this is just the thing you might want to check out if you are considering buying one of these extremely demanding and athletic dogs.One thing I didn't particularly like was the cheap paper that it was printed on. Other than that, it was okay.Pam T~inthebrief about JRT books"
5,Love It!,"Wow! What a beat...makes you want to get up and dance! I especially liked the new version of ""Night and Day"" and the two original tracks. This album is a great addition to any music collection."
4,No Tune Up Feature In this Charger.,"This is an excelent choice for the contractor or DIY that uses cordless tools all the time. If you need to get your tool powered back up fast, this one will do it on your coffee break or while using a spare battery. The only drawback: For the steep price, I would also expect to see a tune up feature included with this charger as is in the DW9116. Still, time is money and 15 min charges translate into ""0"" time wasted if you also have at least 1 spare battery."
5,Good charger,"I've had this unit for quite a while now (it replaced an old one that was damaged). I use cordless drills professionally, and this charger is a must-have if you still use Ni-Cad batteries. It's durable and efficient and charges batteries in a fraction of the time of the standard charger. If you want to make your older Ni-Cad's competitive with the newer Li-Ion drills, you should have one of these chargers."
3,Charger,Now being told by DeWalt that this charger is not intended for lithium-ion batteries. In the process of checking this out as it will greatly affect capabilities of charging my lithium batteries.
4,Electroline EDA-2100,"I did a head to head comparison of the EDA-2100 and the Motorola BDA-S1. They both provide what I see as equal quality, sharp picture on all of my television connected to a Calrad 75-713-8 splitter. However, the Motorola produced four more channels than the Electroline did.I had also tried the PCT-MA2-8P amplified splitter.The PCT produced as many channels as the Motorola did (four more than the Electroline), but it had a very slight grainyness to the picture when compared to the Motorola or the Electroline.If your looking for a single port drop amp I recommend the Motorola BDA-S1."
2,Electroline EDA-2100 1-Port Cable TV HDTV Signal Booster/Amplifier,I wish i had not gotten it.It is not so much the product's problem as how it is advertised
3,Much Kazoo About Nothing,"Very lightweight and , in my opinion, poor sound quality compared to previous Kazoos I have had. Too expensive for what you get."
3,Falling paint and sharp edges,"I love the sound this kazoo makes and my 3-year-old absolutely enjoys playing it. However, there are two compalints.1. The paint on the back of the kazoo is falling off. After about 10 minutes of being played by my son, I noticed that paint has fallen off at the areas where his teeth were touching it. I ended of scratching off all the paint, which was not hard work though. And the kazoo looks just as good now if not better.2. Because it is made of metal, the edges are kind of sharp. I have to constantly remind my son not to walk with the kazoo in his mouth, for fear he might fall and get serious cuts in his mouth."
5,Quality KaZoo,If you are looking for a Kazoo of high quality and you don't want to spend a lot of cash...here is the item for you. Sturdy and well built. Good materials and duriable. I have 4 grand kids from 2 to 8 and they all play with it...and it's still working and looks brand new.
1,Poor sound,"I bought this kazoo and two cheaper Honer plastic kazoo. The plastic ones sound so much better that I am thinking about returning this, despite the small money involved, just out of disappointment. It is that bad.The membrane is barely responsive and the attempts to sing in this thing are just frustrating. Instead of being fun it just makes you look ridiculous and feel tired."
2,disappointing construction,"Sound is wonderful and bright. Initially we were very excited and good thing as we ordered several. Well, that didn't last. We discovered many of the edges on the kazoo were sharp and it cut a couple of tiny lips. Also the center parts fell out. Pooh."
5,Perfect for non-musicians,"A kazoo is ideal for the non-musician because it is the one instrument almost anyone can play as soon as they try it. I bought one to make my wife feel included when I practice with a friend and a kazoo fits in fine with acoustic guitars, harmonica, and/or washboard. The one I ordered arrived promptly and my wife had fun trying it out. The 1st Note Metal Kazoo is more than a toy because it has a good tone and is built to last. The only drawback I see is that the grand daughters will probably both want one as soon as they hear it."
1,The Kazoo did not work,"I purchased this kazoo for a friend, and brought it to her unopened. When the product was removed and tried for the first time, it did not work. It looked to be in perfect condition, but evidently something internal was broken. I was disappointed to say the least."
5,Great For Educators and General Interest Reading,"Dr. Marliese Hogan's thematic units are extremely useful for educators to stimulate student interest and can be tailored to match the diversity of students in a classroom. The book is concise, yet very effective. I would encourage anyone to read this book as an alternative to their traditional reading list. I look forward to future work from this author. This is definitely a five-star book."
4,Good for old concrete prep,"I'm using the wheel for grinding out imperfections as I resurface a 70 year old porch. At one point, the porch was covered with glued on outdoor carpet. We are trying to renew the retro look and this wheel can remove the glue from a wet surface. Make sure you are insulated from your grinder when working in a wet environment."
4,Tubing is NOT included,"The gauge its self works fine. I like that its back lit also. My problem isn't with the item its self, rather Amazon's misleading description of the item.In the Product Features section it says ""Requires a vacuum gauge tubing kit"" which is correct. Contradicting this, further down in the Product Description section, under What's in the Box, it says ""72 inches of 1/8-inch, high temperature nylon tubing"" & ""Tube fittings"". There was no tubing or tube fittings included in the box.Great little gauge for the money. Just be sure to order the tubing kit as well."
3,It's a vacuum gauge,Item arrived as described. It's a simple gauge that I have tested and it will serve its intended purpose.Cheaper and much more readily available than I found at local auto parts stores.
5,Is very fun and not only for childrens,"The game is fun, and is kind of ""Circle of Blood"". A game of quest, and it make me laugh some time. I recomend it."
4,Swashbuckling Fun,"I had a great time playing this game. It wasn't frustratingly difficult (like Myst) or too easy (like Freddie Fish) but just right for a kid who wants a challenge or an adult that doesn't want a long term commitment. The characters are wonderful. The jokes are very funny (though sometimes gross) and are woven throughout the story, puzzles, and dialogue. There were only a couple of places where I got tired of trying to figure out what to do next and only had to slip onto one of several convenient cheat websites to get unstuck. For you parents: It does include talking corpses, zombies, fortune telling, ghosts, evil curses and such, but not in a way even a kid would take seriously. It is almost completely violence free - even sword fights can only be won by whomever can make the best rhyming insults to his opponent."
4,Monkey Madness,"The Curse of Monkey Island was a fun-filled adventure that will keep you wanting more. It is very exciting, although the story is not as good as the first two games. Its animation is top notch and the sound is pretty good. I did have some problems with the sound every now and then. The characters would stutter and blip. Good game that is very good value for the money you pay. Buy it today!!"
4,Top of the Form,"I got this game when it came out years ago and spent and entire weekend with my friend from across the street completing it. I recently picked it up again and played through and if anything my enthusiasm for the game increased. In my opinion this game is the pinnacle of the point-and-click adventure game form, the graphics are stylish the puzzles are original and logical for the most part and where they don't make ""sense"" in a traditionally way the stick to a sort of 'game' logic that is totally consistent throughout the monkey island series. I definitely recommend this game as it really shows what this style of game is capable of."
5,It's even good animated!,"As a long time fan of the monkey island games, I was at first a little skeptical as to whether this game would live up to the previouse two, which, though the graphics were lacking, contained great story lines that made you want to play and laugh all over again. However it took about 5 minutes into the game before I realized that this one was exactly like the other two.With it's interesting, and quite humoruse story line, it's cool tropical music, and it's blatant parodies to the various works of Gorge Lucas, Everyone is sure to love this swashbuckling tale of adventure. And if you don't, we'll lock you in a room with Murry."
4,A worthy sequal,"This game is a great addition to the serise and is very much worth getting. If you're a fan of the monkey island serise ( and like most people I'm sure you are) you will deffinately enjoy this one. One note though, you won't be able to play this game on any computers after windows ME so make sure you look up scummvm and download the program which will help you play the game perfectly. It's free and safe"
3,Not as good as iSi,"I bought this siphon thinking that it would utilize the carbon dioxide cartridges better. Not so. You need two cartridges to charge this siphon adequately. The lever and nozzle is not angled as pictured; rather, it is horizontal, which is awkward, particularly combined with the size of this product. It seems a bit flimsy compared to the iSi. It won't fit in my refrigerator without making more accomodations than would be convenient. Perhaps I can use it for parties, icing it in a cooler of ice with the bottled drinks. For most needs, 2 1-quart iSi siphons will work better."
2,liss 2 quart soda syphon!,"the 2 litre (2 quart) liss soda syphon is a beautiful thing if you just want to look at it. using it is another thing entirely. from day one, as soon as it was filled and charged, it leaked badly and wet the whole bottom of the refrigerator. thankfully amazon is changing it for a new one.i hope this one does not leak. thank you amazon!"
1,Liss quart siphon,Too big for refrigerator. Difficult to use two chargers. sprays fearsomely.Liss 240 2 Quart Stainless Steel Polished Soda Siphon
5,I am becoming quite the setlzer monger.,"I now have two of these. The first is also made from stainless steel but is red. They are both functional works of art, as far as I am concerned. I always have some sparkling water around without buying Canada Dry. Way cool..."
2,"A lot of talking and playing, but not much teaching","Gregg is a great drummer but he is not a teacher of the drums. He talks too much, saying the same thing repeatedly; then when he finally gets around to showing you what he is talking about, he usually blows it right by you. Talking is not teaching. Maybe I was spoiled because I got the Steve Smith DVD first -- that one is the one to get if you want to learn for the long term."
1,Not what I expected,"This is a drum lesson. If You want to learn to play the drums it is good. If you want to lesson to drummers drum, ths is not for you."
5,"FRANKLY MY DEAR, IS THE BEST I'VE EVER READ.","I LAUGHED, CRIED, AND WENT BACK TO THE STORE, FOR ANOTHER COPY. I MADE THE BIG MISTAKE OF READING THIS ONE AS I SAT WITH MY FRIENDS. MS. HILL'S TALENT REALLY SHINES HERE. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SHE WRITES THE FOLLOW UP TO THIS ON"
1,Cheesiest dialogue EVER,"I don't know when this was written, but it reads like a 70s romance novel. Ew. I couldn't finish it. The sex scenes were especially awkward and cringe-worthy. They talked like one of those annoying couples that argue who loves the other more."
4,Good Read,"I enjoyed reading this book. I read it in just one day as it really does hook you. The characters are wonderful and very developed. The only problem is that Selene is torn so much about whether to return to the future or not. I was thinking thoughout this that if I had the life or the lack of a life that she had, I would jump to stay in the past with a man who loved me with the passion that James had for Selene."
1,A Big Disappointment,"This book came highly recommended to me,but it turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments in my reading life. The characters do not ring true, especially James Baptiste and his son. I cannot imagine people in 1845 behaving the way some of these people do and the author seems to have no grasp on how a five year old child would behave. I don't feel that the book was historically accurate either. I decided to read this particular book because I like time travel stories and historical novels. I would not recommend anyone wasting a cent on this book."
1,frankly not worth reading,"The heroine gets on the bad side of a voudine and is sent by curse back into the pre civil war south where she is mistaken for a Quadroon, a light skinned woman of color.The plot is boring even dragging. The characters are two dimensional. And when it comes to period this book does the job badly. The authress should have done better research. It gives the reader hardly any feel of romance and nothing of what life for quadroons was like. Not a feel of the Quadroon balls where they saught white protectors among the southern elite to become their concubines nor the slave market where they were sold as Fancy Girls. It does not even give us anything of the relationships of these women even though their exoticness gave them the reputatation of being the most beutiful women of the south.Better reading would be The Quadroon by Mayne Reid written before the civil war or Old Creole Days by George W. Cable written after the civil war."
1,A waste of money,I love time travel romances but this book was the worst example of the genre that I've ever read.
3,Not for me.,"I tried to get into this series. Don't get me wrong, weird can be good. For me, it's just too weird and creepy. I only watched some of the first show."
4,Meh..,"This series has great potiential, but at times misses the mark and the story lags. However, overall it's enjoyable and mysterious series."
5,American Horror Story,This show is litterally awesome. It's a nice take on the beauty of the horror genre. Every episode is just amazing!
1,"A rambling, incoherent,lazy waste of time","I really can't even begin to describe how terrible this show is. The writers couldn't even maintain consistency within an episode, let alone between episodes. I watched this for free, while sick and running a fever, and I still want my time and money back."
3,American Horror Story,"I usually like this kind of tv or film but this goes a little too far. Also, seeing actors I really think highly of being the way they are portrayed in this series was a little painful. The pilot was really good but quickly went down hill as the series wore on."
4,One question...,"Why did Moira O'Hara age after her death? None of the other characters aged. And she became two characters of different age while other characters stayed at the age and level of maturity they were when they died.And everybody else kept their death wounds. Young Moira was shot through the right eye. Old Moira had that bum eye, but young Moira had both eyes.This is Really Important. Or not."
5,american horror story,"Seriously addictive. Can't wait to geek out on the second season. We loved it as much as we love The Walking Dead, Hell on Wheels, and King of Thrones."
5,Awesome!,Came in early and is everything they say it is! This was a Christmas present for a friend and they were so excited when getting it
3,Mixed,The beginning of this series was edgy and compelling. About halfway through the images and events became a bit too familiar and tedious. The last episode was downright silly and added nothing to the series.
4,American Horror Story Season 1,"Great series. Loved that it was a continuation story. Also liked how they combined horror and kinky. Like others, I'd like to see this added to Prime streaming."
1,Not for me,I was interested in this series because of the reviews I had read about Jessica Lange.While she is always good these stories did not hold my interest. They seem likestorylines I have seen before and not done particularly well.
1,American Horror,"I did not care for this show, It allowed to much evil into the minds eye. It is not a wonder the young people of today are obsessed with death."
1,McDermott's Ass,"The scariest thing about this episode was/were the numerous shots of Dylan McDermott's ass. Other than that, I think this will appeal to the younger (most likely female) audience."
2,Didn't Identify With Characters,I need someone in a show that I care what happens to them. Didn't like any of the principal characters. Wouldn't have really cared if everyone got chopped up.
3,"Started Strong, Limped Across the Finish Line","Just as the title says, the first season of American Horror Story started so strong, and stayed that way for more than half the season, but it really just sputtered to the end. To be honest, I do not even think the final episode was necessary. It just kind of started to drag and limp after eight or so episodes and by the end you may find yourself just wondering why hasn't it ended already! Because it stays strong for nearly 3/4 of the season, 3 out of 5 stars. Ultimately, a rather disappointing finish."
3,Bait and Switch,"I guessed the basic premise in the first few episodes, no real twists there. The show fell off for me after that point. It quickly became a spectral soap opera and lost most of its spooky elements. It's an interesting show, but far from being a horror."
4,I'm In The Groove of Intrigue,"In my reviews of earlier episodes, I've complained about quasi-interesting characters and hyper-speed exposition. With this episode, though, I've found that what may not be a complex narrative is still a truly engaging one. I can see the interpersonal elements more clearly, too, with Vivien emerging as the level head in her marriage with Ben and the relationship between Tate and Violet taking the drama of ""Romeo and Juliet"" into a tense variant. Let's not forget Constance; I hate her a lot less after her visit with a spiritual medium. Anyway, I'm glad I didn't give up on this show before it got to live up to its promise."
3,First 2/3 of season is great. Then it falls apart.,"I LOVED the premise behind thius show, and the clever trweaking of horror conventions, but the denouement absolutely ruined it. The last episode had more false endings than The Lord of the Rings, and each one was cornier and more ridiculous than the last, reducing the show to a comic parody of what it started off being. I encourage you to watch it none-the-less - just don't expect the creators to have come up with a decent ending."
5,AHHHHmazingly intense!,"This show just keeps getting darker, more interesting and more complex as it goes along. Tate is a great character, he and violet have a dark, twisted relationship that is different from any other teen relationships on shows today. Interestingly enough, the fact that he is a murder doesn't make me like him any less. Is that weird? I think that is part of the scary charm of the show, you kind of have to love the bad guys, because they are just as angry and confused as any damsel in distress.It's like a complex puzzle that just keeps getting more vague and also clearer with time.seems like a paradox, but when the line between life and death is so blurred that you cant tell a hawk from a handsaw, or a psychopath from your own darling husband, it doesnt seem so strange, does it?..can't wait for the next episode!"
2,Lots of Gratuitus Sex,"The story was interesting and I would liked it for that, but I don't care to watch people masturbating and having sex. I wish they would have toned that aspect of it down a bit or left it out altogether as it was rather graphic. Oh well, can't please everyone."
1,Waste of time...,"I wanted to check out this show because I typically enjoy most shows that air on FX Networks - Sons of Anarchy, The Shield, etc. I couldn't even get through the first 30 minutes before I turned it off. It was horrible. Maybe I'm just not as patient as most to wait for a show to develop or perhaps I don't have the intellectual capabilities to ""see between the lines"" but I don't want to have to think to hard when I watch TV. After all, isn't the whole point to forget your troubles and just zone out for a bit? I just didn't get this show, was it a horror or a comedy, or a mix of both? There's so much television to choose from these days...why waste your time with something like this? Unless you have unlimited time on your hands, I'd find something else to watch."
1,American scum,"This just shows where we are as a culture. Crude, conditioned, and going down hill fast. What a perfect parallel of what our society is today."
2,WTF>,"Ok, I am a little bit disappointed with this series. Why is it that if Hayden is a ghost, then everyone can see her?????? What is the point of her being dead if she can still have sex, go to bars and be seen by her family as if she is alive. This makes utterly no sense. This whole series is going into a tailspin and I am not quite as fond of it as I have been. Thumbs down and am glad this series is almost over."
5,I love American horror story,"Best show on tv! I'm so happy! I was waiting months and months to buy it!! If u have been waiting to watch the show on DVD, u will not be dissapointed!"
5,I LOVE IT!!!,This show kept me on my toes the entire season and left me hungry for more! Are you ready for he next season? I can't wait for it to come out!
4,Scary,The experience of obtaining the shows couldn't be easier or more convienient through the amazon instant video app. The show is great.
4,cant quit watching no matter how creepy.,"I missed season 1 initially and just watched season 2 as it aired this winter. It was so good that I opted to watch the first season on my kindle. I loved it. it was definitely a ""what's going to happen next"" give you the creeps kinda show. Jessica Lange is a villain that you don't know whether to love or hate."
5,Creepy but compelling.,Can't stop watching! Jessica Lange is the perfect damaged southern magnolia. She mesmerizes with her sweet southern drawl and her painful psychosis. She is truly wicked and frightening.
