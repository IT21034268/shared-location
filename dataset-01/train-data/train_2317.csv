3,Dream Horse Kit,"Like all breyer customizing kits, they are extremely complicated. Don't be fooled by the instruction booklet and examples that make this look oh-so-easy.The mohair is almost impossible to put on and NEVER try to mix the paints and try to make a new color unless you are experienced and have practiced(you'll end up with a big splattered on paint job). I'm not trying to say that this set is bad in anyway, but that it is very hard and will probably get the most use and best results if an adult or child 12 and up is using it."
5,Dream horse set,This Art set looks very fun to play with to make your own horse with any colour you want it is educat. beacuse it shows the artist how their models should look like when they paint their horses.
5,Fun gift,"My daughter loved it! It was difficult to put on the mane and tail, but otherwise it was a great gift."
5,Everything is good!,Everything is good. Came on time with product packed well and in good working order. the ten pack was a savings over the smaller pack sizes.
5,Unthinkable Terror,"Fred Wiehe has created a masterpiece of horror in his latest novel ""Strange Days."" From the first page to the shocking last page he takes you on an unstoppable journey of death and Unthinkable Terror. If you like Horror you will love ""Strange Days."""
2,Sticks to tables.,"I used one of these on my Mom's dining room table, and had a heck of a time getting it unstuck from the table. Since then, we use them solely on picnic tables while we're camping."
5,This book is great,"I've tried other pool instruction books, but they never really helped me to improve my game. Then I got this one. Schneider makes everything so simple and clear that after just a few short months I am now playing at a whole new level. My friends can't believe some of the shots I make. Banking, kicking, even combinations . Plus, they can't figure out how after making one shot, I always seem to be perfectly set up for the next one. (That's thanks to the chapter on Position Play.)I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to become a better pool player."
4,The best Damn Pool Instruction Book Period,This is a very good instructional book with a lot of information all levels of players.
5,Love 'em!,"I guess I write a lot of enthusiastic reviews, but I generally feel motivated by fine products - and these knives are among them.I have a set of the Classic knives, but the one I use the most is the santoku chef's knife. I just prefer it to the ""normal"" chef's knives with the ""French curve."" So when this set popped up in my Gold Box, I jumped!They feel sturdy but not heavy in the hand, and the hollows along the edge really do release the food more easily than the straight-edged ones. The paring knife is more cute than anything else. The santoku shape really doesn't add to its functionality, although it is a nice little paring knife.Keep this set close at-hand, because you'll find yourself reaching for them all the time, as I do."
5,excellent book,"Dan Leperd takes us to faraway places in forgotten times to bring us a treasure trove of authentic regional recipes. We are offered a tantalizing view of (before industrialization's) simple procedures used in bread making. I mean, where else will we find a recipe for ""Cucumber pickle juice rye loaf?"" (p.57) Excellent book to enjoy with a cuppa while planning out what recipes you want to try first."
5,Amazing book,The book is amazing! It is like to celebrate bread making! And the result is delicious!
4,Cute Music Box - Recommended,"The ""Matchbox Melodies, Happy Birthday Victorian Roses"" music box is very cute and has a very pretty sound. We bought four of these (one for us and 3 for gifts) and they all sound great.Winding the music box is accomplished by sliding the ""matchbox"" open to the left (gently... read the instructions) and turning the key. The motion and music are activated by sliding open the ""matchbox"" to the right. When open, the song plays (an abbreviated version) as the motion turns a Birthday Cake. The figures are plastic, but are fairly detailed and look very nice.The body of the ""matchbox"" case is also mostly plastic so I am not sure how durable it will be in the long run, but with gentle use it should hold up well.Overall a good value and a nice addition to our collection. Recommended!"
5,great!,Great toy for my daughter to hold onto easily! She holds this toy longer than any other one and likes to put it in her mouth! Great for bilateral skills!
5,First toy my baby actually held,"This is the first toy that my 2 1/2 month old son actually held for more than a few seconds. I've tried rattles, teethers, links, etc. But he seems to be not interested in those; he'll just open his hands, and down goes the toy. But, with the Winkel, he'll hold on to one of the rings, then eventually, his other hand would find the other side and will grasp it. I've even seem him try to put it into his mouth! Also, because it's larger than a rattle, if he does let go of the winkel, it's big enough to sit on his lap and big enough for him to find it again and grasp it.Overall, love this toy! It's cute, colorful, lightweight, very interesting-looking, fun and easy to wash. Plus, I love that I can place it in the fridge for him, so he can use it as a teether. It's been about a week, and I can say that this is my 2 1/2 month old's favorite toy so far!"
3,Fun colors,This is a fun colorful toy. Perfect to hang on the carseat or stroller. I was disappointed that I had it touching my baseboard heater and it melted. My fault- yes of course. But just letting consumers out there know!
4,Great toy,This has made it threw 2 kids and still looks brand new! It has bright colors so it's fun and inviting. Great for teething babies.
3,"Just Ok,",Not all that interesting to my 9 month old grandson. He just grabs it and moves on to something else.
3,6 month old doesn't play with it much,"I bought this based on the stellar reviews. However, my 6 month old wasn't interested and he's 10 months old now and still not too interested. Oh well."
5,great baby toy,"great for little finger to hold, soft for little gums to bite, Bright to make little eyes shine produces many giggles"
3,just not for my baby,"i thought my baby would love this toy, but we've had it since he was 4 months old (he's 7 months now) and he just never got into it. oh well. i can see how other babies would like it, but mine just isn't interested. his favorite toy is the toy knot though."
3,Eh.....,"Bought this toy for my son's Easter Basket. He is teething like crazy and was about 6 months old when I purchased it. The toy has not held his attention, the ""rattle"", if you can call it that, is very quiet. I have never seen him interested in mouthing on it, and he much prefers other toys like the Oball Rattle and Oball Beebo. It is cute and looks fun, it just didn't work for him."
4,great toy,"Really great for teething, esp when your little one is just learning to hold onto things, but can really hold onto a teether too well themselves. This is easy for them to hold, and easy to bite down on. My 6 month old also loves the colors."
5,loves it!,This toy lives up to its reviews. My 5 month old daughter grabs for it out of all her other toys. It's very light weight so allows her to carry it around. Very good purchase!
5,Love this toy!,"I had to get some toys from my little one to ""grab"" since I didn't have anything for him - and this is one that is just great. It is lighter and softer than expected, easily flexes and he can grab it and chew on it all he wants. Plus it's bright colors are nice. I'm not sure that he really ""loves"" toys yet (he's 4 months old) but I appreciate it, and I love watching him practice grabbing and moving it from hand to hand."
2,9 month old twins don't enjoy,"Maybe we should have introduced this toy when my twins were younger. At 9 months old, they have zero interest in it."
4,&#50500;&#44592;&#44032; &#51105;&#44592; &#51339;&#50500;&#50836;.,&#50500;&#44592; &#49552;&#51004;&#47196; &#51105;&#44592; &#54200;&#54616;&#44172; &#46104;&#50612;&#51080;&#45348;&#50836;.&#50864;&#47532; &#50500;&#44592;&#45716; &#44536;&#45285; &#51109;&#45212;&#44048;&#51012; &#50508;&#44256; &#47564;&#51648;&#44256; &#45440;&#44256; &#54633;&#45768;&#45796;.&#51648;&#51064;&#46020; &#44057;&#51060; &#44396;&#51077;&#54664;&#45716;&#45936; &#44536;&#51665; &#50500;&#44592;&#45716; &#52824;&#48156;&#44592;&#47196; &#50500;&#51452; &#51339;&#50500;&#54620;&#45796;&#44256; &#54616;&#45348;&#50836;.&#44032;&#48333;&#44256; &#51473;&#50521;&#50640; &#51452;&#49324;&#50948;&#50640; &#44396;&#49696;&#51012; &#45347;&#50612;&#49436; &#49548;&#47532;&#46020; &#49332;&#51677; &#45225;&#45768;&#45796;.
1,Product is misrepresented,"I was very unhappy with this misrepresented toy. The baby's family this gift was supposed to be given to is trying to avoid purchasing "" made in China"" toys.I searched Amazon.com for toys made in the USA. This was one of the first entries. However, it is made in China.One very unhappy customer!"
2,Baby toy,"I thought my baby would like this to chew on, but I don't think he ever did. He would hold it once in awhile but not enough to be worth it. He had no interest in it."
2,Didn't really work,This toy does not really make much noise or the texture is interesting enough for our little one to bite on. He just passes it by for other toys.
5,Only teether toy my LO uses,"It's so easy to grab accidentally. This is the only teether my daughter likes using. She gets bored with the Rhino toys because she can't stuff them in her mouth. It is also easy to secure to the highchair so it doesn't end up on the floor. Silicone teethers are great, but they attract hair and lint. The Manhattan toy is a flexible plastic that stays fairly clean. I want to get this one in every color scheme."
5,Easy to grab and fun to drop,"The winkel keeps my 5 month old baby entertained for a long time, whether she is lying down, on her tummy or sitting. It bounces irregularly because of the shape and she loves to pick it up, put it in her mouth, then drop it, and repeat."
3,It looks very nice,Well-made. Vividly colorful and shiny. The center part is a rattle. But our 4 months old boy only shows moderate interest in it. He likes Oball more.
5,Best Infant Toy Yet!,"I got this toy at Buy Buy Baby for $15! I had seen this on Amazon, but when I went to the store, I put it in the hands of my 3 month old who immediately started to play with it. It was magical. Because of the many loops he was able to grab it right away and use his feet which I could see made him feel good. Not to mention the noise it makes when you shake it is a nice reward. Since then I noticed that he has become a lot more confident with other toys as a result of this toy. Before he was pretty frustrated with most of the other toys I gave him such as the ""keys"". I would say that this toy made him a lot more coordinated as he has learned to play with it. My son is now 4 months old. Highly recommend! I'll be getting this for future baby gifts!"
5,Atom,"This was the first toy that my son could pick up, play with and explore (at 2 plus months). The rings were small enough for him to hold and as he attempted to chew on the pieces as he shoved the Atom into his face, I did not have to worry about the toy poking his eyes. My husband and I loved this toy and brought it every where we traveled. My son is 5 months and still enjoys playing with it. We loved this toy so much that we nicknamed it the Atom."
2,My baby did not like this toy as much as she liked disposable straws.,My baby had this since she was 6 months old and she is now 13-months-old. Until recently she liked to chew on everything she could get her hands on except this toy. She would always get bored of it within a minute or two.
4,'the atom' reinvented,"My husband calls this toy the atom. I wasn't sure what it would do for our little guy, but it turns out that its great for the 'grabbing' stage. He can always pick this toy up, because there is so many arms. And he can use both hands which is really great. He still hasn't mastered putting one of these loops in his mouth, though he tries very hard, I'm sure that it will be something he enjoys once he starts teething."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this toy for my daughter after reading all of the reviews on Amazon. I really thouht this toy would be a winner, but since giving it to my 6 month old daughter she has yet to play with it. Every time I try to reintroduce it to her she just instantly drops it and wants to be given something else. I thought she would bite on it like all the babies in the pictures but she could care less about it. Considering it is a more expensive little toy I was very disappointed. I gave the toy to my friends baby and she too doesn't care for it at all."
4,Tactile chewy toy,...waited til the last minute to send a gift for an infant....her parents told me she loved it and that it got there in record time!
1,Baaad Idea,"Another really interesting and fun looking item that had to be returned because it was made in China. Not good, and not recommended for a baby.Wish this wasn't the case."
4,My son LOVES it!,"I bought this toy after looking up reviews on the best toys for 3 month olds. I am a first time Mom, & I wanted to get something that he would like & other experienced Mom's thought were great. Well, my son LOVES this toy. He can easily get his little hands around the loops & he loves the bright colors. He does get a little frustraited when he can't get it into his mouth the way he wants it, but I think it's because his motor skills aren't developed enough yet. All together, I think this toy is great. The only reason I didn't give this product a 5 star review is because he gets aggravated with the toy where he can't get it in his mouth, & because of the small ball/rattle feature inside the red square at the center. This rattle only works half the time, & I usually have to smack it really hard against my palm to shake the ball inside loose."
5,Easy to handle,"My little guy got this toy for christmas and took to it immediately, he is 4 months old and has been chewing on it and moving it from one hand to the other.The toy is very light weight and the ""rings"" make it very easy to handle and the softness make it perfect for chewing. I would have never expect my son to like it as much as he did and to tell the truth its not a toy that I would purchase but after seeing how much he enjoys it I would strongly recommend it for babies around the 4 month mark."
3,Not for babies 6+ months,"This is a cute toy- it is very similar to the 0-ball rattle in that a young baby can grasp it easily as soon as they are physically able. however, like the o-ball rattle my son is no longer interested in this toy. It was useful for maybe only a few months. If you're looking for toys that will keep babies interest as they grow this isn't it."
3,The rattle in the center could be louder...,The upside is that it's easy to grasp with the tubes all over it so she can waive it around and put it in her mouth.
5,Good starter toy,"I found this on a ""must have"" list and bought it on a whim. My son loves it. The tubes are easy for his little hands to grasp and a good starting teething toy as the tubes are small enough to fit in a little mouth. This is my go-to gift for baby showers now."
3,Good,"My son is 7 month old. I bought it for him after I read reviews. Unfortunately, he does not like it."
3,Yawn....says the baby,We got this for my son at 3 months. He was preterm and tiny so most toy are too large for his tiny hand. This one was not. But he's never shown any intrest in it. He just throws it aside. Not worth the price.
4,This toy goes wherever she goes,"We bought this toy for our daughter b/c one time we were out with friends and their daughter was playing with this toy. Well when I wasn't looking our daughter took the toy right out of their daughter's hands and she started playing with it. She ended up getting mad and crying b/c I took it away from her to give it back. So the next day I asked my friend what the toy was and she told me. I typed it into google and saw the amazon had it. So I bought it. We can't seem to go anywhere without this toy. She is always throwing it, chewing on it and she is always carrying around. It seemed boring to me but my daughter loves it and thats all that matters."
4,Each child is different,"I heard RAVES about this Winkel. It's great for teething, etc etc but for some reason my daughter doesn't LOVE IT. Yes she'll play with it sometimes but it's defiantly not her favorite toy. She likes Sophie the Giraffe way better for teething."
1,Made in China,"The product appears to be colorful and perfect for a teething baby, HOWEVER...I bought this solely because it came up when I searched for ""toys not made in China"". The list was extremely limited so I trusted that the short list would include only what I had requested. I purchased two toys. Both toys, selected from this very limited list, say very clearly that they were made in China. This is the second time I have purchased and returned ""toys not Made in China"" from Amazon. I am so frustrated and disgusted."
4,Good for little ones,"This is a good toy, it has lots of loops for little hands to grab and since it is soft plastic it doesn't hurt them when they bang themselves or hurt furniture when it goes flying across the room. My 6 month old enjoys it"
5,Wonderful Toy!,My four month old son LOVES his Winkel. It's easy for him to hold and to chew on and if he bonks himself in the head it doesn't hurt. He is drawn to the colors and squeals with delight when he plays with it. I love his Winkel too....wish I'd found it sooner....I think he'll have fun with it for a long time!
4,Easy for little hands to grab,"This is a great grasping toy for little hands that have just started to figure out how to grab things. My son is 13 weeks old and while he will grasp on to this toy easily, it doesn't hold his attention very well. He may just be a little to young for it still, so we'll keep trying at a later date. It's well made, however and seems to be quite durable."
3,Not sure if it is BPA Free - It matters because your child WILL chew on it!,"Pros:+ colorful, cute and makes a slight noise when shaking it+ light and easy to hold for babies+ so far no safety hazards+ small enough to b put in the diaper bag+ durable, hasn't broken yet after 5 months of usageCons:- time consuming to clean- BPA or Phalate free? - still not sure. It matters because your baby will definitely want to chew and bite on it- bleeds colour? - I read in some reviews it bleeds color when washed, thank god this did not happen to me. I use a bottle detergent to clean this toy once a week. so far haven't had colors bleed.- odor? - when i received it, it had a plastic smell to it as some reviewers have noted, but after several washes it went away.overall cute toy but not a must-have."
5,Great for teething baby!,Toy is great for my teething 5 month old. Easy to hold onto and bite! Also soft enough for when baby swings it around and knocks himself in the head.
3,Our baby doesn't like it,"I know lots of babies love this toy, but not our little girl. Of the many toys we've gotten for her, this is one of the only ones she has never shown any interest in at all. Every time we give it to her (starting at around 4 months and now at seven months), she picks it up and immediately discards it.UPDATE: Three years later, and I now have a second daughter who is three months old, and the Winkel is the first toy that she really will play with, so maybe my first really was the exception."
3,"fun, but the rattle gets stuck a lot",A little disappointed about the quality since the little things inside the cube that make the rattling sound often get stuck.But it's too much trouble to get a replacement or return. So we kept it.My son prefers sophie (http://www.amazon.com/Vulli-Sophie-the-Giraffe-Teether/dp/B000IDSLOG/)and the haba clutching toy (http://www.amazon.com/Haba-1121-Kringelring-Clutching-Toy/dp/B0002HYCMI) a lot better than this one.
4,Lightweight,The sphere is alot larger than I expected wich is nice. But the best is that it is really light-weight for its size. Easy for my 3 1/2 month old to grasp and hold onto. Although it doesn't seem to hold her attention for long yet?
2,So so,"I had high hopes for this one but my son was not impressed at all. I try to introduce it to him every couple of weeks or so to see if he'll gain some interest in it but 4 months later and it's still a no go. As far as quality and such goes, it's good."
3,Okay,"I bought this toy for my 7-month-old daughter, after reading the wonderful reviews it got here. It looks like a neat toy, but my daughter has never cared for it. She never plays with it, and when I hand it to her, she simply throws it down. I'm sure it would be a great toy for the right kid, but she simply isn't that kid."
4,Great toy but not for teething,"I bought this thinking it would be good for a teething toy but it isnt, the tubes are a bit too thin to really be a good teething toy, my baby gets frustrated when she chews on this because it doesnt do much. Other than that it is a great toy, easy to hold on to and makes a fun rattle sound when she shakes it"
4,So far no problems with its arrival,"I will let you know after Christmas what my nephew thinks. Otherwise it came on time packaged well, and looks like how I imagined it and as pictured. From my first impression I think he will like it"
5,Babies favorite,This toy is great. Its light weight and easy for small fingers to hold. My twins grab this from each other all day so I had to order another.
4,Great for tiny hands!,I received this toy as a baby shower gift and ran across it one day while trying to find some toys for my 3mo to play with. I gave it to him and he immediately took to it! It was so easy for him to grab on to it and he loves to chew on all the different loops. If he drops it he can just pick it right back up with no problem because of all the different loops and twist on it. This is GREAT for babies that are leaarning to grab at things and pass toys from hand to hand. Its also a great teether. Its something that I will definitely will give as a gift in the future.
3,My daughter likes to wear this toy on her hand or foot,"My 6 months old took no interest in this toy when first presented with it. However, a few days later she managed to get her hand stuck in it, which made her want to explore. She likes to stick her hands or feet in it, as they get tangled in the colorful bands. She does not seem to want to use it as a teether.One negative impression was the strong plastic smell when it first came out of the box. I washed it well, which diminished the smell a bit, yet did not make it disappear. It did go away after airing out for 24 hours.Would I buy this toy again for another child? Not quite sure."
4,Totally adorable,"I liked this so much that I bought two of these for my daughter. I got this one and the bright colored (with bright pinks and hot oranges). It's a great toy because it's not too heavy for the wee ones to shake, and it's AMAZING for helping to facilitate bilateral hand usage."
2,Manufacturer's Age Range is Optimistic - Not for Older Babies,"We gave this to our son when he was 11 months old. By that point, he wasn't really into passing a toy back and forth between hands. Though this toy is fun to look at, it is not a manipulative toy, so the parts can't be moved or adjusted to make it look different, which I think would appeal to an older baby. As it is, my son looked at it, turned it around in his hands, then tossed it and looked for something else to play with.The manufacturer's recommended age range was up to 18 months and that is very misleading. At 15 months old now, I think my son will only be using this to throw at his brother! Actually, I'm planning on giving it to a friend's much younger baby."
5,Colorful and Fun!,Your baby will love this toy. It is perfect for tiny hands. Those little fingers can grip this really well and it's great to chew on also. Would recommend.
3,Gift,"Purchased for a baby. He didn't seem too interested, but most kids crawl around and grab what's near them. It's colorful and there are no removable pieces."
4,Manhattan Toy Winkel,"Again, my daughter enjoys picking up the toy and then trying to chew on the loops and does a pretty good job of it for a little while, but then loses interest in it. It's very durable and easy to clean. My child just doesn't play with it much and often loses interest after a few minutes. It's a good toy to have around to keep your child occupied for a few minutes at a time."
4,Interesting toy,My 4 month old daughter seems to enjoy it... the colors are vibrant and the little tubes fit in her small hands. It also makes a little rattling noise from the center.
3,Seemed like a great idea...,"After reading reviews, I really did think this was going to be a hit with my heavily teething 7 month old son. Not so much. He enjoys playing with the plastic ""c"" rings I use to attach it to his swing or carseat instead. Oh well. It does win points however, for durability. It's also very easy for tiny hands to grab during their 'racking' development, as well as being light weight. My only slight concern is that when he is on his back playing with it, the toy is rather large and bops him in the head/face quite often."
4,Great toy for learning to reach out and grab,"Our daughter has enjoyed this toy from about 2.5 months and continues to like it now at 5 months. It's really easy for her to hang onto and wave around, which she seems to enjoy! It was nice when she was first learning to reach out and grab because there are so many loops to grab that she was able to do it even when she was unable to be very precise about where she was reaching."
5,"Chew, chew, chew!",My 7 month old niece loves chewing on this toy. It has a very light rattle so that's nice for us and she can really hold onto it easily and chew on it from every angle. It's a great texture for her and seems indestructible so far.
2,Not interested,"I purchased this based on rave reviews from others. Unfortunately my baby was not at all interested in this toy. She otherwise likes balls, rattles and other items. I gave away to a friend."
2,Manhattan Toy Winkel,"ASIN:B000BNCA4K Manhattan Toy Winkel This toy was bought for a one year old infant. It is not worth the money I spent for it. I am very disappointed as it is smaller than than I imagined it to be. It is very light weight, which is good for the baby, but she is not interested in it."
1,eh...,"my baby didn't like this at all... i thought it was cool, but the bell in the middle barely rings. I'm unimpressed.its not very well designed for babies."
2,Fun toy but worth the price?,I bought an almost identical toy for my son when he was 4 months old and he loves it -- but I bought it at the local dollar store. Lots of places for his little hands to grip onto while he was learning to grip and he still plays with it now that he is 10 months old. I'm just not sure it would be worth it at this price - - it was well worth it for the dollar I paid!
2,Buy it at DOLLAR TREE,My twins loved the similar toy I bought at Dollar Tree. The one at Dollar Tree has a duck or pig in center instead of a red mass.I cannot believe they charge this much for the same thing!
2,Boring Toy,This toy is great to look at and fits really well into a very small baby's hand but it's BORING! It doesn't do anything at all except look cute.
1,Makes baby cross his eyes,"My 4 month old baby loves this toy. It is easy to grab and gum. However, we had to stop playing with it because he would gum it for 30 min and periodically cross his eyes! The first time I saw this happening, I took the toy away and we'll try again maybe when he's older. Most teethers sit below baby's eye level when in the mouth. This toy is not meant to be a teether, but because of the way it's shaped, baby will definitely want to chew on it. (note - baby does not cross his eyes otherwise)."
5,My son's favorite toy,This Winkle was my son's favorite toy during his first year. From the time he was able hold something he always chose this. It was great for teething and kept his interest. He loved it so much that I had to buy one for my Mother's house as well. This has become my go-to baby gift.
5,Molly's Number One Toy so far,"Molly is currently six months old, and this has consistently been her favorite thing to reach for and play with since she first started noticing things more than a foot away from her as a newborn. She LOVES this toy-loves to look at it, grab it, stick it in her mouth, bang it against things, whatever. It seems like such a simple thing, yet it has proven fascinating to her when she gets bored with other things. It is also extremely easy to clean, and you can use links to hook it to a bouncy seat, stroller, etc.Other parents I know have said that their kids love this toy, too. It is colorful, soft enough that Molly doesn't hurt herself if she bonks herself in the face with it, and neat-looking!Great gift!"
3,"Great idea, not used...","I'm not sure why, but this is the ONLY toy that remains untouched on my daughter's toy shelf at the end of the day. I bought it for her when she was about 3 months old and really starting to like rattles. She is now almost a year, and never throughout her development since then has she been interested in this toy. I do think it's a great idea in theory, very safe and ""soft"" compared to her other rattles, great for teething, etc. She seems to prefer things that have ""something to do"" like rotate beads, or put together/take apart, or buttons to push, etc."
1,Toxic plastic smell,"When receiving this toy, a strong odor oozed from the plastic rings. I even washed it, but the smell was zoo strong, and decided to return it. I rather pay a little more and get a healthy toy for my newborn. Stronger the odor the more toxic the plastic is. Just FYI. So before buying any plastic object, the parents should smell it first. If it smells quite strong and you cannot stand longer than 30 sec. , one should know where they stand."
1,"Great artist, but avoid anything on this label!","Lagoon records is a outfit that allegedly does not pay out any royalties to the artists whose old recordings they reissue... and the sound quality is generally horrible -- noisy, poor transfers taken from scratchy singles. If you are looking for a great Justin Hinds collection, check out the Trojan releases. They may not pay royalites either, but at least the music is listenable."
3,3 Star Dance Club Mix,"Webster Hall's Vol. 5 is an average mix of club songs with nice beats and some disco influence. The rhythms are very nice in their transitions from song to song. It was definetly not like his Volume 4 but on the whole it had its high points. I'd have to agree with the reviewers who said it was average rather than a perfect 5 star club mix. If you want an excellent Club Mix then listen to Webster Hall's ""Tranzformed"" album. This mix is a classic old fashioned style even displaying the traditional classical values of taste in the back cover which says God Bless The World!!! So in short it's not the best of his work but it isn't his worst."
5,What are you talking about Miami?,"OK, I know it's a bit silly to reply to others' reviews, but PLEASE. The first review of this from someone in Miami makes some comment about how irritating it is that ""some lady"" is singing throughout this disc. SURELY, hon, you don't think this is the same person on every song. This is a mix CD of several dance hits from last year.Then, she mentions that it's disco and it set her on edge. WHAT? Were you expecting ballads. The title pretty much tells you what to expect. Jeez...Look, it's cool if you didn't like it, but your reasons make you lose all credibility. If you don't want dance music, don't by a club disc.For those of you that ARE dance fans, this is a great set. It contains several big club hits from the likes of Sono (their ""Keep Control"" was Billboard's #1 dance song of 2001), Celeda, 7 Featuring Mona Monet and Robbie Rivera. Highly recommended for clubheads everywhere."
3,Can be used to teach about trees and their seasonal changes.,"This book covers the basics of what a tree goes through every season. Arnold and his dog take you through each season and explain what type of activities they do with the tree. Winter they build a fort around the tree for company, summer they build a treehouse, fall they rake and pick apples and in spring they hang out in the tree and smell the apple blowwoms and build a tree swing. Arnold treats the tree as his friend through-out the book. On a few of the pages, there is a recipe for apple pie, directions and explanations of what a cider press is and does and facts about honeybees. My overall impression of the book is that it is an okay book with okay pictures. If it wasn't partially educational, it wouldn't have been rated with 3 stars."
5,On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the...,Detailed description of Charles Darwin's studies. Of interest to geneticists and other scientists. Possibly laborious reading for others. Paperback book without diagrams referred to in at least in Chapter IV (I have not yet finished reading the book).
2,A little of everything,"I really didn't like this specific DVD from Harry Wong. I am fond of his other videos (even though they are ""old style"") but this one has a little of many topics, not well explained or not specific in any topic."
2,Motorola VLV32 Black Leather Case,"I ordered this case for my new RAZR V3x. When I got it, I found out it is too small for the V3x and only fits the earlier (and slimmer) V3 or V3i phones. Very disappointing."
5,Engaging page turner! Not a cookie-cutter fantasy novel,"I'm not a big fan of the fantasy genre and I actually purchased this book to give to someone who's running a Warhammer game -- I've enjoyed everything else I've read by the author. Out of curiosity I started reading Honour of the Grave and I had trouble putting it down. It's one of the most engaging novels I've read in quite some time.It's not a cookie cutter fantasy novel -- the ""heroes"" are a corpse robber and a deserter who largely live by the corpse robber's wits-- and it focuses on well-drawn characters. It also isn't overrun with elements of the fantastic, although it does contain them, but it isn't -about- them. It's all about the characters.I've ordered the other Warhammer book the author has written and I'm looking forward to it enthusiastically!"
5,Zoom Zoom Zoom,"That's what my computer is doing now, thanks to this RAM. I was weary of buying it at first because I had never heard of the brand, but so far so good. Nothing has broken. Now, I just need a new sound card (bleh)."
3,General user's viewpoint,"If you are buying this book to learn the subject described by the title you will be happy, there are many examples solved and some variety is offered.However, if you bought the book like I did, to broaden your narrow knowledge Mathcad, you will be disappointed. The same operations are repeatedly covered, while there are some vast, untouched capabilities left.Gregory."
4,Good video,"Good video, but too marketing-oriented at times to be helpful. However, there are great shots of the differentn gaits that I found helpful. A beautifully photographed video of a wonderful breed!"
5,Perfect little clock,"This clock keeps excellent time, works perfectly, and looks beautiful! Just like the old days. Fairly quiet as well."
1,poor quality rip off,"my son chose the clock based on it's appearance, which I might add is quite interesting. However, the quality of the clock is very disappointing. It was imported from an Asian country, manufactured there as well, as is cheaply constructed. The price on this was over $100.00; I would not have paid more than $20.00 for it had I seen it in person vs. online. I will also let you know that there was a packing slip in the box (which I had to go to the UPS station and pick it up as they would not deliver the imported item) that stated the item should have been a total of $28.00, including the international postage, so that shows you it was misrepresented as well as overcharged!! I am not sure how Amazon can get away with allowing this to happen! I would rate this not even one star if possible!! I feel I was ripped off and the seller should be made to refund my money!!!!!"
5,Very Pretty,Purchased this item for my niece who likes all things goth and fairy. She loved it as did I. The wings are much prettier in person as they are covered in glitter and shimmer in the light.
3,Goth Fairy--lack originality,"I bought these for a goth fairy costume for Renaissance Fairs. The wings are large and beautiful. The straps are wrapped so they don't start rubbing or hurting over time (was able to wear all day without any problems). The only downfall is obviously they are sold everywhere, so if you are looking for something unique, these are not for you. If you're looking for affordable wings for a costume and don't care if you match other people...look no further!"
5,Rain Makes Applesauce,"This is a beautiful book for children, all about nonsense, and with beautiful illustrations. A must read book for any child witha good vivid imagination. Not for timid children, as some pictures may be scary."
4,"Sterling Silver Jesus Pendant, 3/4 inch",It is just what it appears to be and it gives me comfort. You will want to purchase another chain however.
1,Poor quality,Lens broke in the frame after very little use. Changing the lens is very difficultSeriously overpriced for the value received
1,Biased opinions obvious,"The only reason a 5 star rating by 8 individuals can be justified, is not on readability or clarity. It is transparently obvious that, the only criteria was support for their theology. And all reviews say as much. An alternative theory to christology is hailed as the answer to Christs identity with the same enthusiasm as vitamins cure cancer. Anything but orhtodox medicine is hailed as a wonder therapy. Anything but that Jesus is God is here hailed in five stars! The bias is not even veiled. This verbose and out on a limb, interpretation as fact epic work gets a 1 in my rating. Time could better be spent on more honest less ego centric theory."
4,Loved this till I tried Georgio Armani,Really liked this and bought a few times. Then I tried Georgio Armani foundation and loose powder and loved it more! G.A. pressed powder is nice but the compact is fragile and broke within weeks
1,30 MInutes?,I was going to purchase this but the runtime says it's only 30 minutes!!! That's outrageous for one episode. I thought this was the entire Season One. I can get it from other sellers for under $20 for the entire season...not 30 minutes. What a ripoff!
5,Hilarious,"These three men are perfect together. I'm sad to see that this show was discontinued, it's one of the most refreshing ones out there."
3,I love and hate this show,"This is one of those shows you really have t be in the mood to watch, like look at me I'm a hipster mood."
5,Hilarious,Came across this series late one night. Was hooked within 15min of watching. It's slightly dark comedy but totally worth purchasing.
5,Cure for the common boredom,"I was hesitant to watch this show upon it's release because I was unsure of it's genre as it looked kind of ""film noir"" in its previews. Zach Galifianakis is what sold me on initially watching the show, however the whole cast as an ensemble is fantastic. It is uproariously hilarious--the premise of an author deciding to become a detective through Craig's List is inane on it's own, and the fact that we as an audience get to follow these antics makes this show one comedy not to me missed. Every person I've watched this show with is amazed they've never heard of it before, and they are immediately turned on to the boredom antidote! The show gives magnificent credit to the city of New York, every episode follows Jonathan (Jason Schwartzman) through the city on his misadventures and you get a real look at the city through the eyes of the people who live in it. All in all it is a wonderful comedy, a great cast, a great setting, and a great story!"
1,Just plain awful,"The network that has given us ""The Sopranos,"" ""Sex and the City,"" ""Deadwood"" and so many other great shows bombs with ""Bored to Death."" Jason Schwartzman is by far the worst actor ever hired to star in an HBO series. It's supposed to be a comedy, but Schwartzman has no comedic timing. Perhaps it doesn't matter. His lines are lame, anyway.Here's a sample of ""Bored to Death"" humor: Upon bumbling across an AA meeting, Schwartzman asks one of the participants if she knows where he can get a drink to kill some time. Here's another: His agent, played by Ted Danson, comes down with a herpes blister on his lip. He has to give a big speech in a couple hours so he gets Schwartzman punch him in the mouth to ""obscure"" the blister. Hilarity is probably supposed to ensue, and if one of the characters getting kicked in the nuts is hilarity, then I guess it does.The show's premise seems like a great concept. Perhaps it is, but the people hired to carry it off are just plain inept."
2,FOUL PLAY,"This book may be for you if you enjoy following chapter upon chapter of gay men playing football. The remainding chapters dive into the lives of the men off the field. It becomes very soapie very quick, and unless you want to follow a man pondering his last relationship while taking in a hike (for about 8 pages), skip this one."
2,It's not Vic Braden or 2000,"I was misled when I bought this video. I thought that it was in a series from Vic Braden who wrote an excellent book entitled ""Tennis 2000"". This is an entirely different series, however. It is put out by an Australian group. Also, despite the title, it was published in 1992. The video itself is decent, but nothing special."
3,NOT AS PICTURED,"I ordered this cable because I need SATA cables with right angle connectors on each end but keyed in opposite directions, as is pictured. What I actually received was in fact right angle connectors on both ends, but keyed in the **same** direction (both ends are keyed like the connector pictured to the left in the product photo).Looks like a decent cable, but this will need to go back as it will not fit in the system it needs to be installed in."
3,not shipped yet,Ordered this cable three days ago and it has not shipped!If I knew this I would have ordered from radio shack instead.
4,Good set -,"This is a good set; it gets you the new figure of Brainiac. However, when I purchased it from Amazon, the picture wasn't up yet. I wasn't aware that the Martian Manhunter was going to be ""invisible."" It's alright, I just hope my son isn't disappointed at Christmas because he doesn't look like the normal Manhunter. The paint holds up moderately well on these figures, and the material could stand to be a little sturdier. Superman in particular has pretty bendy legs."
1,This is a BOOTLEG!,"Warner Bros. owns the rights to Silverhawks, and they have yet to officially release this title on DVD. This is a BOOTLEG copy. Warner Bros. has asked customers whether or not to release this title in one of their recent online polls, so wait for an official release instead of buying this copy!"
3,The real set is out now.,"This is a bootleg set. It's a shame, because other than the thin-as-construction-paper overpack the DVD cases are stored in, the set is well done and the episodes are decently clean.The real set is out now, so don't even bother trying to find this one."
2,This is one silly story ...,"Peters can write and the book is mostly readable if you can get past the silliness. In the Amelia Peabody books Peters takes the rediculous and creates fantastic, entertaining and humorous literary concoctions.Not so in Summer of the Dragon. I'm surprised she would allow these older books to be published under the same name as the Peabody series."
3,Hit and Miss,"J.D. Crossan's conclusions are really hit or miss in this book. I found his work on the infancy narratives and Jesus' egalitarian philosophy to be generally on the mark but I have some major disagreements elsewhere.First, he admits that he does not believe in miracles. I'm OK with such a sentiment as long as one explains the numerous miracle stories in the Gospels. Crossan fails to do so in a convincing manner.Second, Crossan pretty much ignores Jesus' apocalyptic utterances, passing them off as later additions to the Jesus tradition. However, he provides little evidence to convince the reader of that conclusion.Finally, his take on the resurrection stories is absurd. He wants us to believe that they weren't meant as historical narratives but as stories used to prop up the Twelve or Peter or the Beloved Disciple above the general community. To me, it seemed like eisegesis and not exegesis. I can't imagine the four evangelists had anything like that in mind."
4,The Elusive Jesus,"Crossan is obviously an accomplished scholar and a brilliant writer. However, I do not find his portrait of Jesus as a societal rebel very convincing. His description seems to be based on too many shaky assumptions. Crossan is more successful in showing just how elusive the historical Jesus can be for any New Testament critics bold enough to join the search. The book is definitely not intended to make the reader feel comfortable but I highly recommend it."
3,Hold On To Your Faith,"As Crossan says, in biography, this is the shorter version of his much longer Jesus book, written because people didn't finish thelonger one. I boughtboth and didn't finish thelong one either. He presents a good statement of his research from the Jesus Seminar, but, like much of the material thus presented, a lot of traditional faith events get jettisoned. It is a thought provoking book, however, and presents a challenging and strong view of the career and purpose of Jesus."
1,"Some interesting facts, but mostly one person's opinion","I had no idea what this book was about when I received it for a gift. I found a lot of interesting historical information. But, I have to say I was puzzled by the author's quick dismissal of texts found in the Bible.For example, regarding the beheading of John the Baptist, Crossan says, ""Antipas's execution of John cannot be explained by a simple appeal to Mark 6:17-29, even if one took that marvelous fiction as historical fact."" And after simply quoting the story from Mark, Crossan says, ""Mark's account is best seen as his own creation."" Huh? Why? He never says why. Then Crossan says that 200 years earlier in Rome, a Roman leader had a person beheaded at dinner just to please his guest. And Crossan says the author of Mark is basically copying that story. But this is all just the opinion of Crossan.I would have liked better reasoning in a book like this."
1,Hard Read,"When I first heard of John Crossan, I thought he had some pretty cool beliefs (from the summaries I read). But, for me, trying to read his book requires a deep understanding of the bible and history... which I don't have. Oh well, I guess its more for the learned theologian, not the spiritual seeker...."
2,"Speculation, Hypotheis, and Assumptions!","Crossan, co-founder of the Jesus Seminar, proves in this volume that speculation is fact, Hypothesis is most reliable, and Assumptions should be believed. I have heard Crossan speak on television and read his books, and he clearly communicates a disdain for the reality of a resurrected Jesus that is beyond a metaphorical notion. He stresses faith over reason and I can see why because to believe the nonsense this man kranks out I would have to have a greater faith than I do believing the conservative facts about Christianity. This book is worth reading only to get a better grasp of the ""new"" twentieth century reconstructionism of the Historical Jesus, other than that it's worthless heresy."
3,the vanishing Jesus,"Not very ""revolutionary"" if one has been tuned into historical Jesus research for the past hundred years. There actually was a person, a Jew who was crucified. Aside from this, the rest is ""story telling"". In the sense that Jesus was an itinerant preacher, opposed to the establishment [Roman Empire, and the Jewish collaborators with that Empire], Jesus was a ""revolutionary"". Scholarly backup for these views are readily available in other books, but this is for the ""popular"" market. Of course if you are a Biblical Literalist this is not the book for you."
4,"for the student, quite refreshing","I read this book as part of one of my courses that examined the life and ""person"" of Jesus Christ, which was appropriatly entitled ""Jesus."" In this class we were introduced to the various sides of the historical Jesus debate, which I find amusing to see reflected in these reviews. Out of everything we read in that class, which included Luke Timothy Johnson's ""The Living Jesus,"" this book was easily my favorite. I found the Crossan's suggestions much more fasinating and worth the couple of hours of reading time than anything Johnson mentioned. I was also not alone in my preferance. Most of the class, chalked full of us know-it-all religion majors, enjoyed Crossan the most. His style of writing is incredibly refreshing to those of us who spend our free time reading book after book for classes. While I don't know enough to comment on the accuracy of what Crossan writes about, I do know that it's worth a read if you enjoy books that allow you to say ""what if."""
1,Time to Speak Out,"I read a lot of biblical history and have a high tolerance for, and even an interest in, conjecture. It's necessary. Politics don't bother me, either. People will never agree about everything. For these reasons, I have never encountered any biblical history that I didn't enjoy reading.Until I read this appalling book! The author begins by promising to write about Jesus, and not himself. The rest of the book violates that vow. Mr. Crossan only writes about himself. His scholarship is third-rate. I learned absolutely nothing. I don't disagree with this author. He wasted my time."
2,Its the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine.,Many of Crossan's arguments seem to be built upon his own predetermined ideas. He flexs his scholarly muscle with the use of alot of smoke and mirrors. Crossan either simply can't believe in such miraculous events as a historical resurrection or he doesn't want to. Either way his conclusions are far more unbelievable than a literal account of such events...
4,The Reviews Say it All,"This work of Crossan's is speculative in the extreme, and admittedly so. However, no matter how unsound the conclusions may be, the research is sound, and one is left with a few good questions and a few good ideas about how to approach them. I see that the power of this book lies in its ability to spark controversy, and from there, spark innovative thought. Read the other reviews. All of the reviewers, whether they agree with Crossan's speculations or not, at least were compelled to react!"
1,invest in better knives,Yes they are light and sharp but the steel is cheap. They will not last long and they rust easily. You are better off spending the money to buy one good knife.
4,fantastic knifes,"I bought these knifes for my son because he likes to make sushi. While he was deployed I needed a sharp knife so I tried one, it worked great. I now only use these knifes so I guess I will need to get him another set because I am going to keep his. If you need a really good set of knifes I highly recomend this set. The only thing bad that I have to say about the set is the knife sharpener is not the best and may damage your knifes. I tried it on another knife and it did not do a good job on it. But other than that I am satisfied with the set."
2,"Nice Knife, bad material. Not stainless Steel","After 1 month of using these knife i noticed a brown stain on them. they starting to rust after just a few weeks. This clearly goes agains the ""stainless steel"" message on the knife itself."
3,sushi knife set,knives are very sharp. The sharpener isn't all that great but I use my own. The case they come in looked like it got wet and the paper cover is bubbling up.
2,not one of tengen's best,"indiana jones and the temple of doom, what can i say? this game had a lot going for it since the movie good, but alas, it was not ment to be. the first time you play the game, you bigin to knowtice something, the games messed up. when you jump, you fall down. at first, i thought it was natual to fall, but then you realize the only way this is possible is if indiana was climing, which makes no sense. another thing screw up is the way you change weapon. it's awkward and annoying having to reach over to the select button and push up, down, left or right just to swich weapons. it dosen,t even pause the game. and since the screens are looped, you going to get confused faster than indiana jones would. theirs more i can talk about, but it's not worth it. the game is fun, for the fist 10 seconds you play, but it soon falls apart as you go on.for your own sake, don't waste you hard earned money on this garbage."
3,Nice Product But TINY!,"When I opened these I kind of laughed because these loaf pans were so tiny. Again I probably didn't think about the dimensions. Honestly I don't know what you would use these for. Too small for individual date loaves,holiday giving. Be cute to bake up something for you pet in these."
5,I would recomend it anyway,"So why did I begin David Copperfield? Well I didn't want to do homework and I thought it would be nice to say that I had read a great work of literature. Why did I finish David Copperfield? Because it was one of most intrigueing books I have ever read (and by this point I really NEEDED to do that homework too!) Each character was deep and complex, not a flat one in the book! I enjoyed the way an event here or there would remind me of my own life (being close to the same age of Mr. Copperfield) and how I felt as if I actually knew all of the people he delt with. I will admit that the going is slow plot wise, but the characters! ohhh the characters! If you have enjoyed Jane Eyre or Cider House Rules, I would strongly recomend this as well. I would recomend this anyway, but if you liked those!"
5,great condition,"i've barely read it, but it seems like the perfect book for an essay on jewish vs christians views for the end of the semester... plus it arrived on a great timing and in excellent conditions"
5,Outstanding Historical View of the US Blunder of WWII,"A wonderfully written book of two sides or views from the Japanese internment camps during WWII. My father-in-law was Japanese and this book was an eye opener to what he most likely experienced when he spent time at the camp near Lodi, CA. I found out that Rev.Perry was my parents Methodist minister in WI and was a a beloved friend to all his parishioners. There is always two sides to war and I pray we never as humans or US Citizens create a situation like the internment camps. We did enough to the ""First"" People."
5,A Great Study,"This book is an excellent examination of perspectives of southern masculinity. Belongs with Cash's Mind of the South and Wyatt-Brown's Southern Honor as pivotal works on the mentality of the South. Takes a much more emotional glance at the southern male than the two other aforementioned works. Looks at the mentality of the southern male through the contexts of honor, religion and romance. Thoroughly researched and an enjoyable read. An essential addition to the library of anyone interested in the Civil War or southern masculinity."
3,"Very well written, not my cup of tea","I had to read for a college course. It is very well written, but I am not too big on love stories. The author teaches at UGA where I attended and we got him to come in and talk about the book a bit. He explained how what he was going through in his personal life bled over into the book with regard to love and finding love."
4,Full Metal Jacket CD,"My husband wanted music that was popular while he was in Vietnam and asked me to order this. I have not listened to it, but he seems pleased."
1,Only One Good Track..,"The first one... The rest of the CD is movie instrumentals that are excellent for falling asleep to, but that's about it."
1,BORING,"I am yet to understand why this movie is compared to the likes of Platoon. There is no question which of the two is the better one. I was bored out of my mind after an hour. I turned it off and then when I had time to waste, I finished it. I am sorry I did. 2 Hours I will never get back. I know that evertone is different, but if you have not seen this movie and are thinking about viewing it, do so on a Sunday when you have NOTHING else to do. The only highlight was the Drill Instructor. He managed to crack a smile out me on occasion."
3,Buyer be wary.,"_Full Metal Jacket_ is, unquestionably, one of the finest, most powerful movies ever made. Consequently, the release of this partial and somewhat garbaged-up soundtrack was and remains a serious disappointment.Who thought of the electric/hip hop version of Lee Ermey calling cadence in the first track? The word, ""atrocity"" comes to mind. And ""I Like It Like That,"" disingenuously asterisked as ""music from the period,"" was NOT included in the movie. The overly long ""Time Suspended"" merely takes up space on the CD. But perhaps the most grevious oversight (perhaps they could not get licensing) is the ommission of, ""Paint it Black,"" which as any devotee of this film knows is the capstone of the whole movie.The positives: the rest of the CD, which includes the haunting Abigail Mead score (""Time Suspended"" notwithstanding) and the rock music featured in the film.Blip over the bad stuff and make your own tape, throwing in ""Paint it Black,"" and you're there."
3,It's ok...,DVD Came as promised...with no issues. Has awesome sound and I had forgotten some of the songs that were on there..
2,"Great Movie, Not So Great Soundtrack","I was watching Full Metal Jacket and heard a number of great songs and decided to buy the soundtrack without reading the reviews. If you're reading this, you're one step ahead of me.I gave this soundtrack one star for each song worth putting in my library. Other people may appreciate two or three other songs that I didn't, but this soundtrack is largely in part garbage. Save yourself some money and just download the songs you like on Amazon after sampling them."
4,Pretty much what you'd expect,"This is your pretty standard, no-frills ring, which is just what I was looking for. Looks nice, and I liked the amount of thickness it has; it has substance, but isn't clunky.My only complaint is that it *barely* fits on my finger; I'm going to have it stretched either a 1/4 size or an 1/8 size at a jeweler. I'm not sure if that's a measuring error on my part or of the manufacturer, but since I'm not sure I'll dock it one star."
2,Ring,"When we saw this ring is was extremely shiny. with thought it had more of a dull finish, but it was so shiny you can see yourself in it. It is not how it looks in the picture. Also the sizing is off. if you are going to order this you'll need to order it about half a size larger than your ring size."
5,5mm Half Round Band,"I love my 14K white gold 5 mm plain half round band! Originally I purchased a 3 mm band and found it too thin so I got the 5 mm instead. I wanted a more substantial feeling and looking band to wear by itself, esp. when I am out for a run or traveling and don't want to worry about wearing my normal 2 (diamond) rings. I would purchase this same ring again."
3,"Nice ring, but sizing is an issue","Ring is all right, but now I have to send it back because the sizing is off. I am possitive that the ring is incorrectly sized as I have other rings in the size I ordered which fit perfectly. Now I have to spend money sending it back to get it exchanged."
1,Size off by 1/4 of a size,Total ripoff. Cost me additional 70 USD to get the size right. This was no coincidence and almost spoiled the special day for us. Stay away from this...
1,Very disappointed - Do not waste your money,"I do agree with some other reviewers that this DSD compilation does let most ""Righteous Brothers"" fans down. On listening to both the classic hits ""Unchained Melody"" and ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"", though it's found that the background noise was quite low and the ""clicks"" were removed, the feeling was not right. After comparing to the Verve compilation and the recent re-mastered one (""Gold"") issued by Universal Music, I finally got to know what the problem was!The sound of instruments originally placed on both channels is now crowded together at the center with the focus put on the vocals. Such ""great"" mixing not only destroys the original taste, but totally spoils the good elements and characteristics of the songs. Moreover, the info inside the leaflet is presented in an old-fashioned and a bit disorganized way.In short, don't waste money on this one!"
3,What a singer!!,"I manage kitchen staffed by Mexican immigrants, and first heard Luis Miguel's ""Amor Amor Amor"" blasting out of a cheap stereo this fall.Am I the only one who thinks his singing style's a dead ringer for Stevie Wonder's? Okay, maybe if Wonder smoked cigarettes and drank whiskey. The arrangements also owe a debt to Stevie and I might have said the songwriting as well, except that the songs are Boleros. I can't put this CD on without listening to it 3 or 4 times.I'd love to see him live although I wonder if he shares Stevie Wonder's ability to make an audience shut up and listen!I'd have given the album four or five stars except it bogs down a bit in the middle with a few inferior songs. What a talent this man has. Those who dismiss Latin music after a cursory listening to Ricky or Marc need to dig a little deeper and check out Luis Miguel."
5,Mis Romances,"Mis Romances is a classic. It has a mix of wonderfully illustrated boleros, and also couple of upbeat , modern songs that make you want to get out of your seat, and ""dance"" !!His wonderful voice and instrumentals on this album..... all prove....... one more time.... that he is ""the best of the best !!!Again, he has graced us with his ""angelic"" voice that he not only sings with his vocal chords, but, with his heart, also.I highly recommend this album !! I absolutely love it , & you will too!!!Michele"
4,Mis Romances,"This latest cd of Luis Miguel's isn't his best, yet it is an enjoyable cd to listen to. I especially enjoy the song ""Amor Amor Amor"". For those that have enjoyed his Romance series cd's, I think you'll enjoy this one too."
3,Other 'Romances' Better,"Mis Romances is good, but because of the inclusion of a couple up beat numbers it's not as good as the preious three Romance outings by Luis. If you want to hear Luis at his absolute best I'd pick, in the following order, 'Romance' (1991), 'Segundo Romance' (1994) and 'Romances' (1997)."
3,No tan bueno!,Acabo de comprar este ultimo CD de Luis Miguel y me parecio regular. Ha perdido su esencia y por poco empieza a parecerse a la musica para planchar. Definitivamente tiene mejores discos. Parece que esta perdiendo su estilo.
3,"Great song selection ,nothing new.","The song selection was great. The voice great. But the cd as a whole was not that good. If you are familiar with classics like amorcito corazon(I liked Pedro Infante's version better), Perfidia(this version was good), etc . This cd is worth it only if you have the extra $$ to spend. Its not bad but this cd could have been better. To sum it all up, as in a second review title, I would say this: "" A Commercial Repackaged Bolero Cd""."
4,Watch the 1973 rock 'n' roll film on TCM,"It will be shown on TCM (Turner Classic Movies) on Friday, July 30, 2010 at 8 PM. It's a rare chance to see it uncut on TV!"
5,the audioGOD bruce kulick,"well , bruce kulick was already an amazing 6 stringwizard back when he joined KISS in 1984 for the animalizetour and as the years passed he managed to produce his ownsound , he prooves that he doesn't fall from stariani ,vai or all the shredders when it comes to intensely playedguitar solos but the thing that he does better is - soundingdiffrent , his wha in 'change is coming' prooves this , hisguitar sound like a roaring lion , powerful and fast , alsothe melodic 'liar' is a great insrumental where bruce showshe can also be calm and soulful.bruce kulick also plays the bass in all the tracks and singsin all the songs (there are also four instrumentals included)this is one of the best recordings ever !!!buy NOW!!!koolick ROCKS"
4,KU-LICK IT UP!,"Like the cover art, there are many faces to this effort fromthis awesome ex-KISS guitarist! (12 years folks!) The ones that shine the most? His REVENGE/CARNIVAL OF SOULS like persona in CHANGE IS COMING is relentless and nearly brutal. An ACE-like power poppy approach in I CAN'T TAKE is fun too... Kulick even unleashes his alter ego SATRIANI mode in a couple of classy instrumentals- including the VERY intense/proggy SKYDOME! Another fave is DOGS OF MORRISON... I don't have a clue what it's about, or what to compare it to, but it's a moody gem as well. Perhaps the most consistent post-KISS solo effort ever! Can't wait for his book!"
3,a good rockin disc.,"I did enjoy this disc , Bruce Kulick is awesome guitarist who can write some great hard rockin metal songs. However that being said we have the problem that comes about too often , a lead guitarist fails to hire a singer for his effort and then the whole enterprize suffers from it. Athough his vocals are not as bad as Joe perrys (who makes great music too) this disc could have been a much better disc if a professional singer was on it. This is why michael schenker always hires a lead singer and then he just plays on a disc because he realizes this. Kiss fans will want this one though because they can see that Bruce was able to come up with some cool songs. This guitarist in now with grand funk railroad. Perhaps he can convince them to record a new disc and he can even add a song on it. Anyways I am glad I got this one but it's not for everyone."
1,A subject that can use a good analysis...,"...unfortunately, this isn't it. Borsook shows an embarassing lack of understanding of Libertarianism and deliberate unexamined bias against what she believes to be the Libertarian ideal."
4,"Insightful & intelligent, yet whiffs of Gen-X","Paulina writes with depth, research, and insight - attempting to deflate as many ego balloons as possible about the New Economy without providing an alternative or giving full credit to the personalities behind the culture, whom are naught but nerdy male cardboard cutouts by the time she's finished with them. You can't write off Paulina as a crank - she's far more even handed than one would expect, protecting credibility seems to a major objective here. A very cocksure and interesting writer who keeps her passive-aggressiveness well hidden. A Worthwhile, but uncomfortable read."
1,More from the apologists of the Newt Economy,"Living in San Francisco, and working in Silicon Valley I had hoped this book would be a critical analysis of the exploitative nature of the so-called Cyber Culture. In fact, it's just another rant about how great the NewT Economy really is.There is virtually no analysis of how the driving forces of capitalism chews up people's liberty, how Wired magazine pulled all their original ideas from Holland, how the magazine's float went pear-shaped, or how actually working there really was for the non-celebrity staff.Another book written by Americans for American Porsche Boxster owners and sad Ann Rynd sychophants.Avoid."
5,Scary and good,"The author clearly knows of what she speaks. The view she gives of the high tech world meshes well with the larger world outside in which a few fortunate souls get to become rich, while the people who helped them get rich get the shaft. The government that ensures their clean water, clean air, paved roads, and their tech jobs gets criticized for doing nothing right. I particularly disliked the self-aggrandizing behavior of the cyber-crats and the idea that ""I got mine, now you go out and get yours."""
2,"Starts well, gets tedious","Ms. Borsook's book starts out well, makes some good points, including the basic idea that the prevalent libertarianism associated with high tech culture is selfish, misguided yet a growing force in America today. Her insights from attendance at various high-tech events were particularly interesting. However, I have given up in the middle of her chapter about the magazine ""Wired"", which is based on her personal experiences and oh Lord does she grind the ax to the nub.After a while her writing style also gets extremely tedious: paragraph-length sentences full of jargon-laden descriptives, high tech turns of phrase and dependent clauses. Maybe you need to write that way for magazines to get as much information as you can into a short space, but in a book it really starts to wear."
1,amusing,"If you believe the early days of Wired were innovative and spoke to and about high tech culture you might enjoy the author's rants. Unfortunately old Wired was so bad spending 1/4 of the book using her presence there as proof of her credibility fails.The book is interesting, full of generalizations, and somewhat dishonest. But, between the sloppy arguments there are some valid points that few people are talking about."
4,More like Terribly Flawed but still a must read...,"Although I'm in sympathy with Ms. Borsook's general thesis two BIG flaws served to constantly distract and detract from a full five stars. Her endless thrashing throughout of the ""libertarian"" horse highlights her fundamental lack of understanding of this political philosophy. A broad brush is used where light touches are cried for. As for her days at Wired I find it interesting that she holds up Wired as the originator (as she did again today on KPFA-FM 94.1 Berkeley during an interview) of that style of magazine publishing when MONDO did it first and with way more chops in every area. Since I've worked in the Valley since 1982 I clearly remember discussing with friends at the time (early 90's) that Wired looked and felt like a corporate ripoff of MONDO. Which it was..."
5,"My dad, a Merchant Marine, was thrilled to receive this book!","My father often talked about his life as a Merchant Marine -- and along with the stories, he often expressed regret that they were not considered ""sailors"" or ""military."" He is now 86 and was absolutely thrilled to receive this book. His first words were: ""Finally, we are being recognized. It took all this time."" Thank you for telling the stories of these brave men. My father was NOT able to join the regular Navy because of an erroneous physical they gave him. Thus, he still wanted to help in WWII and he joined the Merchant Marines. These brave men were those who were more than willing to put their lives on the line -- in a military position that was not even recognized. To them, I say ""Bravo!"" Thank you for writing this book; it has given my father closure and gratitude for his years of service."
2,Even the best of authors has a dull thudder every once and a while,"Mr. John D Macdonald has a slew of fine reads under his belt. I have passed many a long afternoon reading one of his paperbacks and have only rarely been let down. However, Barrier Island is by far the least enjoyable work of MacDonalds that I have yet come across. It reads more like a spread sheet than a riviting thriller.Pass this book by. MacDonald is a good writer. Find another of his books. That is my advice. Or if you have read dozens of MacDonalds and are looking for something new. Try a Lawrence Block 'Matthew Scudder' mystery."
1,"plastic, returned for better quality doorbell","it is plastic and the gold ring around the doorbell is gaudy in persondidn't like at all, returned it the very next day for a better quality frogended up purchasing one at thefrogstore(dot)com and love it,sorry amazon, this one was a miss...btw, LOVE amazon's returns,it was free, easy, and quick! refund came quickly too!"
2,Buy the CD instead,"The visuals are horrible. They're much better in the recent Vienna 1973 concert.Everything on this DVD is distorted and blurry with washed out color. The performance is good, but there is a loud surface noise throughout. Since I already have the DVD, I won't buy the CD, but I wish I had bought it instead of this."
5,Definitely worth reading!,For me this book was life changing. It explained finally some of the things that have happened to me physically in a way that was very understandable and credible. I am making a concerted effort to reduce the anger and stress in my life. This book made me more aware of the consequences of that kind of lifestyle. Highly recommended especially for anyone who has one of the autoimmune diseases. You can improve your life!
1,"Christiane L. Aubry ""wants to know more"" Pennsylvania",All over the place.Confusing. Poorly organized.I was unable to read this book and would love to return it.Bad very bad.
4,Healing The Wounded emotions,Good all round book for the doctor or counsellor looking at non pharmacological means to tacklean immense problem in society today.Also some key spiritual truths as emotions are intimatelylinked to the human spirit.
4,"Bought as a gift, but recipient seems pleased","I'm not in a position to review the material because I bought this as a gift for my mother, who has gotten very much into this subject recently and asked me to buy this for her. She seems quite satisfied with it, though, and recommended I buy a copy for myself."
4,New at using a kindle,"As this is the first book I've order for my kindle, I am learning how to use it and am enjoying reading this book at night in bed. Now my fingers don't hurt from holding the pages open."
4,Deadly Emotions will change the way you think about life!!!,"This was an excellent book, I didn't care for all the detailed doctor talk but what did get my attention was the seriousness of what these emotions can do to your body if left unchecked. I do believe that cancer and all other illnesses come because of all the negative emotions people hold inside. I'm glad for the wake up call this book gave to me. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to see change in their body and attitude. It will make you think twice about hanging on to those negative emotions."
3,a little techincal,this book is a bit boring on and off. sometimes it's more interesting mixed into the boringness. I would suggest you borrow it from the library and read it first before ordering it for your own personal collection. I don't think I'll read it again... kinda a waste to have bought it and now have it sit around here.
5,Just As Described,This book gives us insight on how our emotions really play a vital part in our overall health and lifespan. The seller was truthful in the description and condition and delivered before due date.
3,A Book About a Superhero,"THE ADVENTURES OF THE BLUE AVENGER is a book about a sixteen year old boy becoming the Blue Avenger. I gave my story three stars out of five, because I don't really like the idea of becoming a superhero. I didn't like reading this book, and it wasn't even close to the best book I've ever read. The only part that was interesting was a sixteen year old punk, becoming a hero. Other than that, I didn't like it. it's hard to follow, and it's way too long, it took forever to read. Three stars isn't bad, but it wasn't the best. I would have rather picked something else to read. What kind of name is the Blue Avenger? Overall I didn't like it, it's not even close to a four, or a five."
1,"""THE ADVENTURES OF BLUE AVENGER"" Stinks bad.","This book was one of the worst books that I have ever read in my entire life. Having a story about a kid that doesn't like his name so he changes it to ""Blue Avenger"" is stupid. If anyone changed their name to something like that they would be considered a lunatic. Also, what is up with his ""superhero"" costume? A blue fishing vest and a blue towel around his head, people would think that he was a terrorist. Another thing is that what 16 year old kid want to be a superhero anyway. That is something little kids want to be.Something else that bothered me about the book was about how it goes on and talks about things that have nothing to do with the story. Who really cares what happened at the same time that David decided to change his name to ""Blue Avenger?All and all I think that this book was the worst book that I ever read and I do not recommend this book to anyone."
5,"Schlotzsky (like Blue, i too changed my name)","Just to explain the above sentence, yes. My name is Schlotzsky...This has got to be the best good i ever read. Not only does it make you think (sometimes more than you want to), it makes you laugh. Howe does a very well done job at first introducing facts or events at the beginning of the book, and somehow tying them all together at the end, which makes you wonder if this all happens in your own life. The book deals with age-old philosophies, and questions that will never be answered. The night (or morning) i was finishing the book, i started laughing out loud at certain parts, and had to bite my tounge in fear of my parents waking up. I recommend this book to...well...ANYBODY!! But only read it if you like to think. So that means half of my friends are out of the question...Seriously, you will enjoy this book. DON'T PASS IT UP!..."
5,Want a Book That Keeps You Reading More,"I like the book The Adventures of Blue Avenger because ,like it says in the title, it keeps me reading more. Plus you never know whats going to happen next. Here are some things that happen in the book: changes name, makes weepless merangue pie, and saves someones life. I really like this book so try it out."
4,Chip and Dale,"I think any carpenter should have this book in the shop, and it should be so well read that its pages are loose and worn. Don't have to buy this book in good condition. It is wonderful for inspiration and knowledge of how furniture design changed and evolved throughout the last couple of centuries. If you are looking for a design, or whatever, you need to see these, and then, your mind will help you do something based on knowledge and imagination."
3,Lasted 4 years with a little help,"Works, where hose timers working off water pressure often do not. Dial stem cracked after 2 or 3 years use, but luckily for me the piece did not break entirely off, so I could twist a wire around it to hold it in place. Tip: When you purchase this take off the dial and invert it. Twist a turn of ""baling wire"" around the plastic shaft of the dial to reinforce it. (The plastic shaft has a D-shaped hole down its center to fit onto the metal shaft of the timer.)The mainspring broke after 4 years use."
2,Garden Hose Faucet Timer,"This product didn't last long, it split at the seams. It might be OK if your water pressure is low"
3,Easily broken,"I've got 2 of those timers. One works well, doing what it's supposed to do (note that it doesn't turn on automatically, you have to do it yourself). Another one is already broken after using it not more then 10 times."
1,Not reliable,"I bought three of these and they all failed within the first six months. They all failed by staying open when the timer counted down to zero. I've flooded my garden enough not to use them ever again.Unfortunately, by the reviews, there doesn't seem to be a reasonably reliable simple mechanical timer out there anywhere. I've had good luck with the Dramm so far, only breaking one by pulling the hose too hard & snapping the valve side connector off(my fault)"
1,Just OK,"It's a good way to turn off your hose after you leave with this device.But turning your hose on is a different thing altogether. Maybe I should've read the description a little better. But if all you want is to turn your hose off on a timer, then this product is for you."
2,OK for a while and then...,"I liked this timer at first for its stout little body. It worked well, though it shuts the water off more aggressively than the gentle stop of our Gardenas. Thus it went well for the first season. But in the second season, every once in a while it would stick open. At first I thought it was my error, but then one day after finding it running many hours after it was set for 30 minutes it became clear that it was sticking. Too bad, but our water is much too expensive to risk to this timer."
3,Works pretty well BUT...,"Originally this timer worked fine...1st Edit: I have had the timer fail to run (water still on after hours), but only when the hose was stretched, and I expect this would not be unique to this model.BE SURE IT IS WELL CONNECTED, and HOSE HANGS FREELY; NOT STRETCHED/TORQUED.2nd Update:Maybe once it malfunctions it's ruined...Quit working pretty much completely :-("
1,NOT HAPPY,IN THE PAST I HAVE LEFT MY SPRIKLERS ON BECAUSE OF MY POOR MEMORY. I WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN I RECEIVED THREE TIMERS. TWO WORKED FINE BUT ONE DAY I SET MY TIMER TO WATER ONE OF MY GARDENS FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES SINCE I WAS GOING AWAY. WHEN I CAME BACK I FOUND THAT THE TIMER NEVER TURNED OFF MY WATER. I EXPERMENTED WITH IT A COUPLE OF TIMES WHEN I WAS THERE TO WATCH IT. IT DIDN'T TURN OFF. I HAVE YET OT RECIEVE MY WATER BILL BUT I KNOW IT WILL BE WELL OVER $100 JUST BECAUSE OF A FAULTY TIMER I WAS DEPENDING ON. I AM SURE THAT IS THE REASON THEY HAVE THEM.I DOUBT IF YOU YOU MAKE THIS RIGHT WITH ME BUT YOU DID ASK.
4,6 YEARS OF SERVICE IS RATHER A GOOD RECORD.,"I have used this model for at least 6 years and it has been a great buy, but yesterday I set it for 45 mins, when shopping, came home several hours later and it as still sprinkling. Am not sure what the problem is but haven't been able to get it to shut off after any of the time setting since then. I liked it well enuf for those 6 years, the price was right, and will order another one."
2,"sent wrong brush replacement, not this one",I was sent wrong brushes. I didn't look at them when they first came. why would they do this ? now it isn't even available.
4,Good quality stuff,"This product is very good, the toothbrush heads work very well, it is recomended by the manufacturer to replace every 3 months."
3,review,"They arrived as scheduled but did not fit my toothbrush, I guess that was my mistake but it's hard to tell by the description in the produt profile."
2,Fair At Best!,"Drury has written this book in the same style as Advise and Consent and some of his earlier bestsellers, but that's where the comparison ends. A Thing Of State only mildly holds your attention. Too little happens over long passages to keep you engrossed. On a few occasions I even thought about giving up on it. While Drury continues to demonstrate his strong knowledge of high level politics (although you might not agree with his personal opinions), my basic reaction to this is WHO CARES if he's not telling a story that sustains my interest. Save your time and money and read something else."
2,A Nation and an Author in Decline,"Drury has become a lot more cynical since his ""Advise and Consent"" days, when chummy senators protected themselves but ultimately protected the country from its worst traits. In ""A Thing of State,"" Drury proceeds to berate Bush, Clinton, and their nameless successor for being all talk, no action, and for selling out America's foreign policy dominance for a shot at reelection. He condemns voters as having the attention span of two year-olds, and (remarkably) produces a conspiracy among a trusted group of Arab-Americans in Washington -- a description that is reminiscient of the racist paranoia that gave rise to the Japanese internments in World War II. Drury hits the reader square in the face with his message repeatedly to the point where you just want him to shut up. Still, it's a compelling read and a thought-provoking message, although one wishes he'd concentrated more on character and story -- as he did in previous works -- than on lecturing us."
4,Teddy Bears,"This was a delightful book that shares the importance of teddy bears in the lives of young children. It was an eye-opener for this reader, as I never realized that children might look at teddy bears so differently from the way I do and did as a child. I was concerned with the sibling treatment shared in this book, but this could be an area of discussion within a family or even a class."
4,Not the same numbering,The questions are numbered differently. The Kindle edition starts by numbering the Reflection. I wish the delivered edition was the same as the preview and the paperback. This will make following along in a class harder. Like the portability of Kindle but not the differences. Some information is not the same and it is broken up differently.
4,Simple but good.,"I enjoy the book. The inspirational readings are quite good. It helps to have 2 versions of scripture written out on the page so you could do the study w/o your Bible if you wanted to, not that I recommend that. The basic questions are a little repetitive and basic for mature christians. Overall, still a great writer."
5,Excellent,"Very impressive collection of songs. It's hard to believe that this band is not on the same inter-national level of those such as Ride, Radiohead, Coldplay, and many others whose sound is derivitive of the Beatles acis period. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a complex indie-rock band. Buy it."
4,Just plain ol' fashion fun,Just a purely fun game to play. Pop it in for a quick race anytime you feel like it. The courses are challenging as you progress through the cups.
4,Rocking fun with trucks,Our first purchased Wii game beyond the sports game. Easy to get started but lots of challenge for more experienced gamers. Neat way to use the controller and it is quite easy to become comfortable. Scenery is great and varied. If you like driving games GET IT!
2,Dissatisfied with the Seller,"I ordered ""Excite"" for my son for Christmas. When we tried to play it, the WII would not recognize that the disc was inserted. We popped the disc out and when we looked at it, it had a couple deep scratches and a tiny chip out of the side. My guess is that with the tiny chip out of the side, caused it to be unrecognizable. I would recommend not to buy from Kenyon@game-hog.com."
4,Almost new,"The only difference in this and a new one was price and the fact it was not factory sealed. The game arrived quickly, looked like new, no scratches. Our grandson loves it. Thanks for prompt shipping."
5,Best Racing Game for the Wii,"Exite Truck is a typical arcade style racer with tons of unlockables, awesome trucks, and great tracks. The graphics are also one of the best for the Wii. If you ever feel like having some good fun, play this for a while and you'll be satisfied. So basically what im saying is... GIVE US A SEQUAL NINTENDO!!!"
3,Excite Truck,Excite Truck game is good my son play a lot with it will buy again from this seller this game is almost identical to Excite Bolt is have a little different stuff and a little more hard to pass the level to get a new truck to race
2,Not that much EXCITE,"Extremly fast paced game. tutorial took way to much time to try and learn all the different things you need to know to control the truck and maybe win a race. There are many other , better race games than this. Rent b4 you buy..."
2,Mediocre and overratted!,"Game is ridiculously overrated. I thought it would be a lot of fun to play but it's just repititous point A to B type of arcade ""racing"" like in a game from 20 years ago; no online play option at all (In 2007? With a console that has internet access built in? Hello?). Graphics are just mediocre. No realistic physics model, poor choice and of little differentiation between vehicles, only a small handful of actual courses so the graphics are ho-hum. This is a $20 game, at best."
3,Beware this game,"If you got a Wii for Christmas with only the included Wii sports or with the Wii Play package, Excite Truck could create household issues. The bottom line is that this game is lots of fun. In fact, it's a whole lot more fun than the basic Wii games, which will mean that your kids won't really find the basic Wii games to be all that interesting anymore. They'll just want to race. That may be just fine with you. But if you got the Wii because you wanted a video game that was more active and less like a traditional arcade game, this may defeat the purpose.On the other hand, the game is a blast . . . ."
2,"Decent use of the Wii controller, but gets old fast","OK I admit I'm not a big fan of racing games. I liked Burnout 2 on the Xbox, but that was mostly because of its crash mode. How much fun can you have driving in circles over and over again? Yeah the courses change and there is the competition aspect, but really in the end you are just sitting there holding down the accelerator button and tilting the controller. There's no real strategy, suspense, or thinking. Oh and the physics are weak. Explain to me how a car can turn in mid air with no wheels touching the ground? This may be fun for parties for about 5 minutes at most."
3,Excite Truck,"I received the product quickly, in good order and for a good price. However, I cannot adequately give a review of the fun or overall experience as my kids have only played it once so far. They are currently enjoying the sports package that came with the Wii..."
5,Exhilarating + Insanity = Awesomeness,"Excite truck is absolutely amazing. I love racing games my wife does not but she can't keep her hands off ""my"" game anymore.You go fast the entire time, huge jumps, huge crashes, spins, ramming apponents, speed etc... just pure sweetness.The wii controls are different but fun. You move left and right, back and forth, heck I can't even lean back on the couch I get so in to it.The game has many features, tons of levels, about 15 choices of trucks that you have to unlock, versus mode and challenge mode, its great!Highly recommended game for everyone, even those avid need for speed racers, this is great!"
4,Gift for 7 year old from Uncle,"After some initial shipping problems where the local post office forgot where we lived I got the game in time to take to my nephew for his 7th birthday. He was a little frustrated at first, as he tried to master the training sessions, but with a little help from his Dad he figured it out. We skipped some of the training sessions and just ran the game. He picked up how to steer very quickly and it was great fun for him. He tended to press the wrong buttons at first but after about 1/2 hour he got the hang of it. The only thing we( his mum and dad and I )could not figure out, not even after I read the instructions ( I'm an engineer and a computer geek) was how to race two trucks side by side. I left early but was told later that he played with it for 3 straight hours then it was bedtime.His 4 year old brother did not have the finesse yet to drive it though."
5,Excellent Ideas - Great Help,"I very much like the author's down-to-earth advice, so much so that I gave this helpful little book also to my sons. It is not as if you found absolutely new ideas or the ultimate wisdom in the book - you rarely do so in books or courses of similar content. The important thing is that you are made conscious of many things which you do have in your mental archives but never apply. And that is where the book helps apart from being an enjoyable read."
4,Wonderful collection of standards,"I saw this book in the home of a pianist. My friend, another pianist, thought this collection of music, and the arrangements was fantastic. He especially enjoys the ""Cry Me A River"" arrangement (allegedly difficult to find). I bought a copy for my friend, and he was ecstatic. I also bought a copy for my wife, a sometime pianist. She also enjoys the music."
4,Dio's last strong album,"Dream Evil is argueably Dio's last strong album until Magica was released in 2001. Every album after until then just didn't measure up. Dream Evil is more reminesent of Dio's first two albums Holy Diver and The Last IN Line ratehr than Sacred Heart. There's less keyboards and more guitars. Like previous albums, Dream Evil kicks off with a fast track entitled Night People (one of the best tracks on the CD) and is followed by the solid title track. Sunset Superman has good guitars but suffers from a somewhat awkward chours (sunset superman?). The fouth track All the Fools Sailed Away si one of the best songs Dio has ever wrote. Other than an awkward keybord towars teh end of the song, it is nearly perfect. The rest of the CD is solid Dio metal music. Dio fans will be pleased and so will metal fans in general. Check out the awsome cover art. Gives new meaning to ""Sleep Tight."""
3,Missing Vivian Campbell,"What is good about this album is that it still maintains the trademark DIO sound, and whats' bad about this release is the absence of Vivian Campbell. Craig Goldy is not a bad guitarist, but Viv sure is 10 motches better than his successor in the band. Save for 4 songs, ""Night People"", ""Dream Evil"", ""All the fools sailed away"" and ""Overlove"", the rest sound half-baked. How could DIO ever conjure up a corny comic book character like SUNSET SUPERMAN???!! The beats on this song are good, but then it almost sounds like a pop-rock song with the ""boom pah boom boom pah"" beats over and over again. The saving grace is Dio's fierce baritone that put life into all the songs, even the corny ones. I bought this cos I am a hardcore DIO fan, and it goes for the others too...buy it if you live, breathe and die by his name."
2,Don't Be Fooled!,"Listeners:Don't get taken away by all the hype surrounding this album. ""All The Fools Sailed Away"" is an OK ballad. The pop sound of this album is nowhere near Dio's best. For new listeners, I'd recommend Holy Diver, Last In Line, and Lock Up the Wolves, which are all hard-core Dio albums."
4,Check it out.,"Hey guys. Has anyone else noticed that when you look at the word ""Dio"" on the front cover upside-down, it resembles the word ""Devil""? Anyways, this is a great disc by a great artist. I would consider Dio to be a Metal God. Check out his album ""Holy Diver"" if you don't know his music."
5,Dio/Goldy rules!,"This is the best Dio album ever along with Holy Diver.I mean,every song on this albums is fantastic.Craig Goldy is a guitar wizard(thank God he's back again now in 1999 in the Dio line-up),a couple of fast songs,the cd starts with an excellent fast song(Night People)and continues with hit after hit.Highlights on the album:I could have been a dreamer,All the fools sailed away(with an excellent keyboards solo),Naked in the rain and Sunset superman.THIS IS A MUST FOR EVERY METAL FAN OF THE 80'S!!!And don't forget R.J.Dio is still today the best metal vocalist around!"
2,Not Very Good,This is not a very good Dio album. Vivian Campbell left/was fired after the Sacred Heart album and Dio's solo work has never been quite the same. Pretty mediocre songwriting throughout and it once again has that horrible high treble mix just like Sacred Heart. This one is strictly for Dio die-hards.
2,D,"the worst Dio album of all time.. thats hard to say being the big Dio fan that i am.. was disappointed, what can i say...."
1,PIRATE COPY FROM AMAZON,"THIS IS AN AWSEOME RELESASE FROM DIO; HOWEVER, MY COPY I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON SQEALS JUST LIKE A CASSETTE TAPE GOING BAD. IT IS OBVIOUSLY A CHEAP BOOTLEG COPIED FROM A BAD CASSETTE. I SHOULD SEND IT TO THE RECORD COMPANY, THEY MIGHT FIND IT INTERESTING."
1,This album...,was an attempt at playing guitar on a Dio record.Lock up the Wolves IS a scale layden MONSTER DIO record.
4,"More melodic then usual,yet classic.","At the end of the eighties Dio turned towards a more melodic,radio-friendly sound without becoming totally commercial.Craig Goldy's playing is outstanding(without forgetting the rest of the band)and while Dio did not explore any new areas lyrically,this record was a hit with both the fans and the critics."
2,Bad Dream,"Dio's mystery lyrics get just downright irritating and generically bland with songs such as 'I Could Have Been A Dreamer.' Good replacement for Campbell but the guitar work is not all that great. 'Last In Line' is the last good album Dio made: avoid 'Sacred Heart' and everything released afterwards as it just doesn't measure up in music and the 'magic' lyrics just simply become lame. Dio's best stuff is with Sabbath and Rainbow really. He also did two great tracks with Kerry Livgren on 'Seeds of Change': 'Living for the King' and 'Mask of the Great Deceiver.' That's something you wont hear anywhere else, Dio singing Christian rock!"
5,Another one of the greats,This cd is another great Dio album. I enjoy it so much I am afraid I may wear it out before I even have it for very long.
5,DIO BEST...,"together with Holy Diver. Yes people, this album is as good as Holy Diver. It is a lot better then Sacred Heart which disapointed me a bit. Graig Goldy's guitarplay has something the same with Ritchie Blackmore's guitarplay. Very melodical and great solos. Ronnie James is in great vocal conditions, he sings very beautiful. Dream Evil is the best title track he has ever written. All The Fools Sailed Away is one of the best powerballads ever! My favorites here are: Dream Evil, All The Fools Sailed Away and Faces In the Window! The rest is also very very very very good! If you are a metal fan or a hardrock fan then you must own this album! So, if you don't own it yet, BUY IT!"
3,TENNIS 2000 COLLECTION VHS,"The series of three tapes contains excellent footage of many professionals demonstrating forehand, backhand and serving shots. The tapes could be rated 5 stars except for the aweful and totaly unnecessary background music that drowns out the commentators remarks! The sound effects actually ruined an otherwise excellent instructional tape. The music is both widely varying in its loudness and frequently makes understanding the vocal instructions nearly impossible to hear. To line up and video tape so many top tennis pros and then have some inept sound affects man destroy the usefulness of the tapes is inexcusable."
1,Totally useless in other countrries other than America or maybe France,"The only place that this book might help is in America or maybe France. Each country has it's own sign language. Did you know that England has a totally different sign language and American Sign Language did not come from there?. American Sign Language actually originated in France. You need to do more research when you decide to publish a book that is absolutely useless and, is an affront to the Deaf(Not! hearing impaired). This comment comes from a hearing person that works with the Deaf. I was all excited when I saw the title I mistakenly thought this book was going to contain signs from fourteen countries. Now that would have been an accurate book that I would have been happy to have purchased."
5,Signing in Fourteen Languages,"This is an AMAZING book! We have a group from Belarus that come every year and using this book, they can learn ASL be reading the words in Russian, their native language. Those from other countries that would like to learn ASL can use it this way as well.Another way we use it is to have our exchange students look up the Russian word so that they can use the ASL equivalent to ""talk"" with us. It allows us to ""speak"" through ASL without the need for a Russian to English interpreter. It does not replace the interpreter but since only one comes with 10 children, it is the next best thing!I've also taken this book with me on Mission trips to hispanic countries that do not have their own Sign Language and use ASL. They can learn to sign in ASL by reading in their native language!"
1,"Land channel programming Requires EXTRA cable and software, shame on ICOM","Purchased this small little radio two weeks ago. To be honest, there are far better ones.Sending / receiving qualities poor, clip broke at first day and the advertised land channel programming needs extra cable and software approx 100 bucks. Shame on ICOM."
3,"Brass Mail Slot -- It's quite small, solid, but caveat...","These things are small -- not big enough for a bundle of magazines. If you are replacing an older unit, make sure that the plate on the new unit is big enough -- otherwise you may have to improvise by making your own. Made if fairly solid brass, but not like in the old days. Good enough though."
3,below expectation,actually reading book. Dissapointed at price quoted not honored. Forced to purchase at a higher (35%) more expensive same book. Dissapointed.
1,Not a very good read,Not enough modern views were touched on in the book. It was very long and drawn out with scattered views. The author lacks a talent for writing. It was not a good read and is not worth the time.
3,2 and 1/2 stars really...,"I'm dissapointed with this guide. The information's chunky and winded. Read, 'A Compact Guide To The Christian Life' by Karen Lee-Thorp. It's much better."
1,May be The Worst Purchase I Made In 2010,"I found this retriever to be unusable and frustrating. I wasn't able to maneuver the ball into the holding area. The handle telescoped well, but so what. I threw it into a lake at the course."
5,Great Retriever,The Search and Rescuse 24 foot retriever is great for getting to those golf balls that are out aways. It is heavy when fully extended so one has to be careful not to let it over power you.
4,The Best Practical Guide out there,"Mongolia is a difficult country to travel. No infrastructure, roads, cities, familiar modes of transportation, hotels or food.This guide is practical and detailed to help plan and execute a safe, memorable, fun trip with out having to spend thousands of $'s on tour groups.The best guide out there!Janice Jaffe"
4,Indeed -- Crimson Petal in -what- year?,"I very much enjoyed the soundtrack (much, much more than the movie) for what it was -- some beautifully done music. I don't know enough about composition to relate different styles to different periods (my knowledge goes about as far as ""dissonant=modern""), but I -do- know literature, and just want to note that ""Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal"" is a poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, published in 1847 -- which would be WELL after Becky Sharpe sung it in the movie, even with all the bizarre time-jumping going on in it. This in no way diminishes the song's beauty, and I love the poem for itself -- but just wanted to add a few grains of salt to the historical accuracy of the soundtrack, which remains, to my ear, quite beautiful.A further quirk to me was the ""Salaam"" song, which is sung in Arabic. Still enjoyable (though it made NO SENSE in the movie), but I feel it's worth noting that it's not any dialect of Indian."
3,Crimson Petal - historical correctness,"I did like this movie... but I'm not going to pretend that it stuck to the book or was even remotely historically correct. I loved the song ""Now sleeps the crimson petal,"" but I did want to clear up some things about it. I've been looking for the sheet music and it doesn't appear to exist. There are about 7 people who have written songs based on Tennyson's poem, but this version was written by Mychael Danna, does not even closely resemble Roger Quilter or Robert Young. Mychael Danna did nearly the entire soundtrack and he is wonderful. I just wish i could find the sheet music."
3,tis a chick flick,"Vanity Fair..A feast for the eyes...and hardly a true period piece! SO the music is a bit out of sync...It is still fabulous and for the musical snobs..I too happen to a VERY learned ""chantuese"".. and in my opinion Custer Larues'. Crimson petal is anything But wimpy...It is meant to be whispery..and provocative..there is nothing uncertain at all about it...MUCH control there..!Becky Sharp is a character that many women adore because she is STRONG and ruthless! Who cares if the movie was not dead on accurate..It was truly enjoyable...ANd I loved it!"
3,"Some excellent, some average","The two songs I was impressed by were ""She walks in beauty"" and ""Now sleeps the crimson petal"". The performance was great and as a fan of Sissel's the only fault I can find is that the poem was only one stanza. The original poem is a classic and I just wish Sissel had sung the entire poem. The two songs are poignant and leave you almost unsatisfied with the briefness.The other tracks are average, but nothing that really went and grabbed my attention. If you were impressed by the beginning of the movie, don't bother buying this cd."
2,one song..,"The film is a ham-fisted tin-eared badly-dressed attempt to shoehorn Indian culture into a Victorian novel. The dialogue is both horribly anachronistic and lousily delivered including by, surprisingly, the usually wondeful Ms Witherspoon. Another shabby sari crash-landed in Regency London would have driven me out of the multiplex, but I was kept in my seat by one redeeming moment - when Becky Sharpe wins over the snobs with a song, Crimson Petal. OK, its structured more as an early 20th century song than anything from the Regency era, but it works wonderfully. And almost justified the soundtrack, if not the film. Which remains an insult to Victorian novels, Bollywood and self-respecting turkeys."
2,Have they ever BEEN to Athens???,"Although the recipes may be good (I haven't tried them yet), the ""flavor"" of UGA football is totally missing - my copy seems to be a Georgia cover over an Ole Miss book - there is a nice description of the Ole Miss campus in the forward, and even a ""Ole Miss Gingersnaps"" recipe, but NOTHING about GEORGIA !?!A big disappointment for a UGA alumni. :-("
4,Perfect for Saturdays in the Fall,"This is a nice book with some good recipes for tailgating. The best hamburger I ever tasted came from this book! Remember, watching the game is only half the fun."
5,"Outstanding, well researched book!",This is an exceptionally well researched and documented book. The author is extremely thorough and even includes his business card with the book if you want to email and dialogue with him. His passion for research and meticulous attention to detail clearly shine throughout. The book itself is a nice hardcover with solid binding that makes a nice addition to any home library. Highly recommend!
4,Great stats book,I bought this book for my social stats class and it was perfect. The chapters are relatively short and all of the answers are in the back in case you miss a problem. There are also many problems worked out for example in the chapters that help a lot too. I reccomend trying to find the ABC Calc for excel if you want to work out a lot of the stats problems.
2,Good but not enough,"I bought the book in order to expand my abilities in 3ds max 4. I began to read and noticed that the author explained the tools with moderate detail. That wasn't the end of it. The examples and tutorials were mainly on how to do the the image found on the cover. I recommend looking for another, more descriptive book. I'm 14 years old and I have worked with Lightwave, Maya, and 3ds max for two years seeing that books are always helpful."
4,Mesmerizing,An almost hypnotic affair. At once melancholy and uplifting. A must have for lovers of the heartbroken and poetic in music!
2,"Dismal, Dreary, Dirges","This cd is for the Depressed and Numb. I can't think of another cd I've heard recently that has annoyed me more. First off, the singer has adopted a style that wails in off keys, somewhat reminding me of English folk ballads, with lyrics that are undecipherable and unlistenable. It is sort of a personal poetry that somehow she thinks might be interesting to others but really is a lack of good songwriting skills. This kind of singing is both self indulgent and very limiting in range. The only saving grace of this cd is the group of musicians which carry the recording. They are quite good and very melodic but are constantly killed by the singer's agonizing quality. As far as I'm concerned, Orange County can have them."
5,"Relaxing album, good buy","Good beats, nice rhymes if you liked the Typical Cats then this is a must. Only problem is that it should be longer"
5,err um,"i have actually only heard the first track on this album , but it is an extremely good and if you liked typical cats you will like this one ."
3,Not up to the standards of his earlier books,"I have read 3 or 4 earlier books of McGarrity and enjoyed them very much, especially the setting in the beautiful southwest. This book, however, has an unbelievable number of characters, most of whom are not important to the plot. I felt I had to diagram them out on a sheet to keep them straight. Kerney is an interesting character, but I was not impressed with Sara. She and Kerney are not going to make it on a long term basis. The crimes to be solved are never a mystery and they are totally unrelated to each other--filling up pages I thought."
5,MC GARRITY JUST GETS BETTER & BETTER WITH EACH BOOK!!!,"WOW! this was terrrrrrrrific!!! what a great visit with kevin and nice to have sara back in the picture....and i loved alllll of the other characters...and another wow!!! for the wonderful storyline...i 'gasped' out loud more than just a couple of times....yikes!!! mc garrity paints such a vivid picture of hermit's peak that you can clearly see it and its surrounds...of course, i can't say enuf about the beautiful book cover....and the new photo of the author...his son took it??? just keep them coming and we'll keep enjoying our brief sojourns with kevin and sara....can you write faster and longer??????"
3,A small start...,"This book barely scratches the surface of the preparation required for the CCIE R&S; written. The test has a considerable amount of minutia, some of which isn't even covered in the Cisco documentation. There are a number of topics on the test that not only aren't discussed in depth in this book, but actually aren't discussed at all. And of course it will in no way prepare you for the questions where you know the answer, but its not on the list (Cisco is notorious for that).But its a start...and the test engine is an easy way to memorize the minutia that it does cover. Just don't expect that this book hints on all the topics that will be on the test."
3,"Good book, but poor service","I purchased this book about a month ago and have found the material to be well suited to the purpose of reviewing the material in a condensed fashion. One bit of warning, however. I purchased this book mainly because of the advertised flashcard software for Pocket PC. Because I travel so much, I thought studying CCIE material would be a productive use of my down time. I was very chagrined to learn that the software doesn't install successfully on my Pocket PC. The CD touts support from Cisco Press and urges you to register with them but as far as I can see this is more for marketing purposes than as an opportunity to support the user. I even took the trouble of browsing the errata at the Cisco Press website and emailing the address they listed for book support but didn't receive a response from them. The material is good, but I have been sorely disappointed about not receiving what I was promised. For the price of this book, they really should deliver."
4,Sarah's Review,"As a highschool student, I found this book to be extremely inspiring. Anyone who has ever thought of entering the field of business should read this book. I did and it helped me channel my i nner ambition. Redstones inspiring stories (he survived a terrible fire) made me want to get out and conquer the world. At times, Redstone seems a bit full of himself, but anyone who can climb to the top usuallly is. This book is a great read to anyone wanting to find passion by reading from a passionate person."
4,A Story of Great Achievement,"Although he maintains a much lower profile than Rupert Murdoch or Barry Diller, Sumner Redstone is just as powerful and interesting as his better-known peers. Sure, he's boldly promotional about his achievements and about those of his company, Viacom - but as someone who came from humble beginnings to create a tremendous empire through intelligence and hard work, he can afford to indulge a bit. He gives credit when credit is due and pulls few punches when it is not. What is perhaps most remarkable about his story is that the most exciting part did not begin until he was into his 60's. It is a good read, offering insights into corporate politics, negotiation, and the recent history of the entertainment business. Recommended."
1,This book drips of ...,"All I can say is, this book drips of narcissism. The song from Mac Davis kept coming to mind during the read...""Hard to be humble""."
4,The House of Sumner,"A spirited view into the Man who has created one of the greatest media empires to date. A Passion to Win is a display of what one person can accomplish if they stick to what they believe in and love what they do. The book is the basis of what his business philosophy is, stemming from his up bringing and schooling at Boston Latin School. The book raised my respect for the man who amassed accomplishments upon accomplishments prior to his Viacom years. The only missing details are the lessons learned in his earlier failures or mistakes made prior to Blockbuster. Your given a sense that he did everything write until that point. The only early failure noted is a mistake he made in a spelling contest. I wish he would have humbled himself to the quote I once read from him, ""Success is not built on success, but on failure, frustration and catastrophe"". Outside of that, it was a great and highly recomended read."
1,Self-Serving BORING BIO,"Well, I was initially very interested in reading this book, but like most bios of this nature I found it to be very self-serving. Why buy a book whose best picture of reality comes from looking in the mirror? Where is the beef?? The book is more publicity for Redstone than an honest work of journalism. Perhaps Restone should take his title to heart, because as an author I am sure he is winning, but as readers we lose out on this one."
5,This is an extraordinary man.,"Of all the business books I've read, this is perhaps the best. It is refreshingly well written, and unlike most that have pretty well given everything they've got by the end of the third chapter, this book continues to teach throughout. Sumner Redstone's personal, academic and business history contains enough superlative accomplishments to convince even the most critical of readers that this guy is for real."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with the other reviewers Sumner is too much of a bragger to make this story enjoyable. Also, I thought he would have discussed more in detail his childhood and how he grew into the powerful man he is today. His story always is focused on his accomplishment yet never touched on a single set back or defeat. He bragged about his Harvard education, his power over Barry Diller at QVC, and he even bragged about how he changed the way Viacom was pronounced. Give me a break. He also bragged that he loved to sue companies to get his way. Nice."
4,Early intermediate to intermediate,Great book for people starting early intermediate. My two complaints are they left out some of the best 90's movies (like the Lion king). They also should of made a table of contents for difficulty.
3,Disney Love!,I love Disney songs! I bought this book to teach voice students and I realized with one of my friends when we were trying the songs out some of the chords are off in the book to where the songs don't sound correct.
4,"Great selection of songs, not for late beginning students","I purchased this for one of my piano students. It has a wonderful selection of songs in it. However, I really don't consider it easy piano. Seems there has been a trend towards making things harder and labeling them as easy. But it's still a great book. My student is currently starting Piano Adventures Lesson book 2, and this was a bit too much for her."
5,exactly as described,I ordered a piano music book for begininners and it is as promised and helping my daughter learn the piano quickly
1,Very elementary.,"I suppose if you know absolutely nothing about Cavaliers this book might be somewhat helpful (although there are several others that would, even so, be MORE helpful). All in all, I found this book to be disappointing. Information is minimal and superficial. I might recommend it as a child's book, but other than that, I suggest you pass. Other books cover Cavaliers much better."
5,"Liked it, helpful",Helpful in explaining our dog to us. The housetraining part did the trick for us. We were having trouble and now no more accidents.Good advice on alot of stuff. We love our little cav.
2,Breeder's Vanity Book,"This is a typical breeder's vanity book. It has some valuable information, but it is downplays the very important health issues. Cavaliers suffer from major hereditary diseases, such as mitral valve heart disease, the leading killer of the breed, which afflicts over half of all Cavaliers by age 5 years and nearly all Cavaliers by age 10 years, and hip dysplasia, which afflicts over 20% of all Cavaliers and can cause terrible pain and debilitation, and syringomyelia, which causes severe head and neck pain and paralysis to a growing number of Cavaliers. www.CavalierHealth.org"
3,A True Cavalier,"A well written book, easy to read and comprehend. Points out the advantages of owning a CKCS. A good book for a potential owner to read before obtaining the puppy.Children will understand this book."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"I was looking for popular culture takes on the seven deadly sins and Dante's ""Inferno"".This book was a superficial glitzy product that appeared thrown together.It did not have much to offer as either pop culture entertainment or as an illustration of (the consequences of a lack of) morality."
5,"Refreshing, hype-free ""reality therapy"" -- a life saver","This book breaks away from the pack by combining practical, hype-free admissions advice with a refreshing dose of reality therapy. In addition to soup-to-nuts application guidance, the book offers parents advice for preventing the college admissions process from straining our relationship with our kids (I strongly suggest reading this book with your college-bound daughter or son). The author wisely cites studies showing that a good parent-child relationship is a far greater predictor of academic and life success than SAT scores or selective college acceptance! Thank you -- I needed that."
1,Very disappointing!,"As one of the aforementioned ""overwhelmed"" parents, I didn't find this slim book helpful at all. There's very little to it, first of all; I suspect the author wrote this in a weekend. Each ""chapter"" is about two pages long; the style is breezy, uninformative, and somewhat patronizing. I don't believe this author is as amusing as she thinks she is. The information provided isn't anything you didn't already know, haven't heard a zillion times before, or couldn't find out from the Internet or your child's high school career center. Finally, that's a hefty price tag for something so inconsequential."
2,Not Helpful to Me,"I really had high hopes for this book, but boy was I disappointed! I was going to buy this book outright, but decided to check it out from the library first. Good idea! Most of Arlene Matthew's writing in this book is supposed to be funny- I think, but in reality, it wasted my time. However, I did find that wherever she has a little paperclip icon, there was usually some good info. If you put all of the paperclipped information together, it would probably be about a 20 page booklet instead of a 253 page rambling chuckle book. Honestly, check it out from the library before buying it. This book just wasn't helpful to me at all."
2,Nothing Profound,The author mostly states the obvious--stuff you already know. Some of the information can be insulting or belittling. You don't need to spend your money on that!
2,ESPN is for kids,"If u are under 13 or american, buy this game.ESPN is too easy and dont have the AI that WE5 has.If u know the advanced soccer technics and wanna a real game, a game for MANS, buy WE5"
2,Good for a day or so of fun...,"This game is not as bad as I expected it to be, although it is only fun to play for about a day or so, but not much more. After that frustration sets it.It is very hard to control the players, they keep switching between who you have control of, or better yet, running away from the ball. I kept finding myself squeezing the controller harder trying to get the players to move where I want them to go. Instead they seemed to just wander around.The instruction manual is also not very good. Rent it, don't buy it. You will be glad the day you return it."
1,Worst game ever!!!,I don't know whats worse this game or the league itself.Konami needs to wake up and give us PES(Pro evolution Soccer) and not trash like this game.
3,I'm not very sure......,"I do not know about you but i surely hate this game. I bought it just so i can try it out. The graphics and team detail is okay but the gameplay is messed up! Really, honestly i recommend you to buy fifa 2001 or 2002 because it has all mls teams and all other european teams in the game with better graphics than what we have here."
1,TOTAL RIP OFF!!,"This game is trash, Who cares about the lame MLS!They probably made this game for the U.S. Market, but HELLO!!, the largest market for football (Soccer for the U.S.) videogames in this part of the world is south the U.S. border, all over from Mexico to Argentina.Don't take this wrong, but this game is an insult to football-soccer fans. Don't buy it. (...) I gave it one star just for the graphics."
3,We want Wining Eleven 5!!,"ESPN MLS extratime is a bad traslation of Wining Eleven 5, Where is the option of edit your players?????? Where is the world cup??????? where is the international cup?????? No real players of other teams, and only stadiums of MLSWhat happen KONAMI of America, show the world you can bring here the excellent game Wining Eleven 5!!"
1,Shame on Konami,"What have they done? They had the best game ever with Winning Eleven 5 (or ISS pro evolution PS2)and they created that? This game was created by the Honolulu branch of Konami, shame on all of them. The game is slow, the international teams don't have the real names, the USA have the best team! It' s still better than FIFA 2001 but it's so disappointing..."
3,Why...?????,"Why MLS? Why International teams with invented players? Why not at least leave names like ""Batustita""? Why don't Intl. players have the looks of the real players? Why the Honolulu office? Why modify gameplay? WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE US WINNING ELEVEN 5? WHY KONAMI?"
5,This Game is the best,"The graphics are awsome. The only thing they should have put in was more international teams. YOu can play for lots of cups like american cup, european cup, mls cup, etc. The shooting is awsome b/c you can chip your shot over the keeper so you can kill the ball. The goalies actually come out and not like other games where my stay in the net. This came has international teams so i think you should go get this game b/c it's good. Fifa 2002 probably will be just as good. The difficulty is good. There are easy, medium and there is and all-star mode. All-Mode always keeps you game good but maybe every once in a wahile you will win by 2 or 3 goals. There is a practice mode so you can practice several things."
4,Good multipack,"This was a good pack of characters. Aside from getting yet another Super-man figure, it came with a hero, Starman, and a potential ally or villain in Amazo. The Amazo figure is really simple, but looks great. I have trouble getting Starman to stand in any normal kind of position, but he is sculpted very well.I personally prefer the old mold of Superman, as the joints on his limbs look horrible. The added articulation gives great play value, but I'm not sure how it would hold up to rugged play. He got put in a box to give to my young cousins as a gift, whereas the other characters got display shelf space in my collection."
5,This is a classic,"I found this book to be a classic. It really sifts through real life examples of how to really impact other people through a positive way. Its not a book that teaching manipulation, but rather how to bring out the best in others. I soo strongly recommend this book. It really is a classic."
4,wow,"Ive always been told you cant change anybody, but after reading this book i was convinced that by changing your own actions, the people around you will also change. this book was so easy to read, it was outlined and you can jump from which ever chapter you need to work on wiht you family, or mate, or freind. I read this book in one sitting at Books a million, and took notes on it, thats how easy it was for me to comprehend. i havent tried the techniques yet, but just from the advice he gives, i think my husband is gonna see a different light. i dont think it really changes a person, it just makes them open up more, i guess it brings them out of their shell.... everybody has these traits some where, you just have to know how to bring them out."
1,Don't waste your money,"What a bunch of cr%$. This is the stupidest ""self help"" book I've ever seen. Yes, I did read it all. It was shallow and egotistical. Example - under how to get someone to stop nagging, it says that the only reason someone nags someone else is to get attention. Nope. I nag my kids to pick up behind themselves because I want them to pick up behind themselves. This book tells you, supposedly, how to change other people to suit you. He doesn't explain what to do when someone tries to change you and you don't want to be changed. Another example - for a grandfather trying to help his drug addicted gang member granddaughter - his advice is to move or send her to the Peace Corps. Dumb stuff. Save your money unless you want a good laugh. If this is any indication of the level of all of his books, don't buy any unless it will help you balance a table."
3,Dissapointed by Overly Simplistic View,"I ordered this book with high bopes and I am struggling to make time to get more than half-way through this book simply due to the ROI I am feeling on my time. It's ultra-simplistic approach over-simplifies deep-rooted belief systems and tries to convey the perception of effectiveness by providing virtually 3 sentence write-ups for every problem out there. There are very few ""a-ha"" moments in the book and not enough depth to explore what happens when things go off in tangential directions."
2,Common Sense,I must confess I did not read the entire book word for word because it struck me as being pure common sense. I would not recommend the book unless you are just starting out in life and do not have much experience dealing with people.
3,Its ok,Not alot of light like i thought it would have. I had to install another light fixure to have more lighting in my kitchen.
1,Very superficial. Waste of money,"I wanted more depth on the subject of music than what Britannica OR Encarta had to offer and therefore I wanted to buy a music encyclopedia. And I stumbled upon this on in a store and bought it. After I went home and inserted the CD into my computer, I realized it was a colossal waste of my money. It didn't even offer the depth that Encarta, despite being a generic encyclopedia, offered. Don't waste your money on this one. I give a one star rating because Amazon does not allow you to give a zero star rating. I also consider that to be a waste of one star along with my money."
3,"Not that bad, well not that good either.","Marty just couldn't top ""This One's Gonna Hurt You."" This cd wouldn't have been so bad if ""This One's Gonna"" wasn't so good. He uses the same formula on this cd as his others. Unfortunalty this sounds like leftovers from all his other Cd's. But it isn't as bad as some would like you to think."
3,A decent hat,"I love anything poker paraphernalia, but this was just not the quality I was expecting for the price I payed. I also had a world of trouble actually getting the right product from the company; they sent me a board game, and I had to ship that back to them to finally get the hat I ordered."
4,A couple of wasted lives,"I knew something of the story of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, but after reading this book I think that Scott is the one who needed therapy.I can't believe he accused Zelda of stealing material from him. After all, it was her life. I'm sorry that she could not break away from him.I found it interesting to read about the amount of money he was paid and how they spent it all. He probably realized he wasn't going to live to be old."
3,Less interesting that previous albums,"This album doesn't have as much interesting guitar work as one might expect from Marr. The songs are well written and forceful, but then so is all of their work. This album just didn't interest me very much, and I like everything else they've done. It's not really worth having to me, because most of the decent stuff can be gotten off compilations.I should say that this album is generally understood to be Morrissey and Marr's personal favorite; it likewise has become the favorite of most hardcore fans, although not in my case. Meat Is Murder or The Queen is Dead are much more interesting, or any of the compilations."
3,"Bitter, bitter pill","Much darker and meaner than most of their stuff, this is actually my least favorite Smiths record. It has a couple good songs, but really just marks the abrupt and bitter end of this fantastic group."
4,"7 stunning songs, 2 good songs and one awful song....","The Smiths last album spinns off with the magnificent 'A Rush And A Push And The Land Is Ours', one of The Smiths more experimental songs...no guitar on this one I figure. 'I Started Something I Couldn't Finish' wasn't that good, but OK. From now on to 'Paint A Vulgar Picture' it's great songs all the way though. The groovy jam 'Death Of A Disco Dancer', pure pop songs as 'Girlfriend In A Coma' and 'Stop Me...', ballads such as 'Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me' and 'Paint A Vulgar Picture' and the forgotten 'Unhappy Birthday' makes a fantastic album. The magic dissapears though, when 'Death At Ones Elbow' shows The Smiths at their worst. 'I Won't Share You' mostly sounds a bit out of tune, and never really make it to my ears since I've pressed the 'STOP' button before 'Death At One's Elbow' have gotten a chance to destroy the day...this album could be their masterpiece, but fails due to a poor ending..."
4,"Well, I'd trust the band members over anyone else...","If it makes any difference, in the latest issue of Uncut, take 104, Marr states that the band always thought 'Strangeways' as their strongest record.I personally think 'Meat is Murder' was best, but I remember listening to Strangeways very heavily in 1987, and having a complete feeling of sadness, because you knew it was over. Not because it was poor in any way, but because the mood of the record was so alone."
5,...it goes to show how little you know...,"for me, the best example of The Smiths musical and lyrical style in one place. This album is about having so much passion for something (hating, loving, obsession, politics, loneliness,ect.) you feel it to be a crime (or almost a crime). Hence the title; Strangeways is a prison in England. And the cover art: a still from East of Eden; Morrissey was so obsessed with James Dean he wrote a book about him (which is hard to find, by the way). And filmed a video in his hometown. Morrisey's wit and art with his lyrics and Marr's amazing musical talent contrast, contradict, encourage, and compliment each other and the listener."
4,El Fin!,"The Smiths are such an awesome band. Morrissey is unique and intriguing, with a cool vocal style. Their last album is full of all the loathing, bitterness and sarcasm you've come to expect, along with a campy charm that makes this so listenable. The sound is tight; drums crisp, bass groovin', Johnny Marr jams out again utilizing smooth acoustic to feedback and distortion, Morrissey of course shines with fantastic lyrics and primo vocals.My favorites are: ""Death Of A Disco Dancer""/""Girlfriend In A Coma""/""Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before""/""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me""/""Unhappy Birthday""/""Paint A Vulgar Picture""/""I Won't Share You."""
4,Lamentable Pleasure,"This was the last album that The Smiths presented to the world, and it sounds like it. Although the sheer genius of Morrissey and Marr shine through, there is still something missing. Marr quite frankly sounds like his heart isn't in it anymore. Gone are the wonderful guitar overlays that Marr used to dazzle us with in the past, it is replaced somewhat by a more lamentable sound that seems to be asking for something once there and now sadly gone. Still the album is still superior to anything U2 will ever produce, and Bono will have to live with the fact that no matter how hard he tries he will never attain the sheer wondrous heights that The Smiths achieved so effortlessly. A must buy for anyone worth their salt."
4,I wont share this.,"This album doesn't seem to get the praise that some of their others do, but I can't understand why. Personally, as far as their proper albums go, I like it second best after ""The Queen Is Dead"", and this is similar to that. The only songs I would call hits here are ""Girlfriend In A Coma"" and ""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me"", but ""Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before"", ""Unhappy Birthday"", and ""Death Of A Disco Dancer"" are all good too. I also like the mellow closer ""I Won't Share You"", which is typical ""Morrissey"". Overall I'd say this final studio album of theirs is essential ""Smiths""."
3,"Least favorite Smiths album, better than most solo-Morrissey","I first heard this album my senior year of high school, right after it came out in '87. Some of the very best Smiths songs are on this album: ""last night I dreamt somebody loved me,"" ""i won't share you,"" ""i started something i couldn't finish,"" ""death of a disco dancer."" Some of the worst ones are on it, too: ""girlfriend in a coma,"" ""death at one's elbow"" and ""paint a vulgar picture"" -- the latter one is a bit too ironic for words... ""reissue, repackage, repackage, re-evaluate the songs"" indeed. (How many compilations has Morrissey released?) Anyway, even the lamer songs on this record are very good."
3,The best? Hardly!,"Who are these reviewers saying that this is the best Smiths album? Have they heard any other Smiths album? My guess- no. Anyone who owned (and likely wept to) The Queen is Dead can immediately recongnize the undeniable superiority of that album.. Having said that, this is still an fine collection of music. But the best- really, get over it."
2,"Strangeways, Here We Come","It's not the best Smiths album. that's all there is to it. its alot more accesable than alot of their better stuff, so if you don't actually like the smiths, but you like songs like ""How Soon is Now"" and ""Handsome Devil"" then you may like it. But overall, its just a mess. it lacks the biting, satirical lyrics that are a trademark of morrisseys, and marr is just really below par. i mean, it's fine to listen to casually, but songs like ""Death of a Disco Dancer"" are so droning, i can barely get past them."
5,Super category romance that leaves the competition snowbound,"~<p~ letter inviting her home for the holidays, she decides it might be a good idea to separate Cameron from his homeboys even for a few weeks. <p~ <p"
1,Very disappointed - limited dictionary,"I bought this device because I thought it might help me on a vacation to Spain. Boy was I disappointed. The number of words especially common travel/tourism related-words, that it knows is small. The unit is hard to operate. Even the travel alarm is poorly implemented. Save your money. Buy something else (like a good phrase book)."
1,DF 4033 TRANSLATOR,I misplaced my manual if I ever had one. I agree with most of thee a copy o g mcomments stated. I am disappointed with it in that for a quick glance you cannot read the instruction when you open it. I don't know if when you close the lid that it shuts down the battery. I finally got the clock set and alarm but it was a challenge just from the instructions inside the lid or top cover. It would be nice if you had an off and on button to let you know that is was either on or off. I received an e-mail from the maker giving me the manual. It was worthless. It does not matter they don't make this anymore. Don't let anyone try and sell you one.
5,Outstanding Campaign Study,"I am a cavalry historian, and for years, I have found little of interest in the Fredericksburg Campaign. When I heard that Frank O'Reilly, whom I have known for a number of years, was working on a truly detailed tactical study of the Fredericksburg Campaign, I began looking forward to reading it.Frank has done a superb job of chronicling the events of November and December 1862, casting a critical eye on the conduct of a battle that probably should never have been fought. Utilizing a vast array of sources and with a well-written narrative, Frank O'Reilly has done justice to a campaign that has long required a detailed tactical analysis.I think that this is one of the finest campaign studies in years, on a par with the superb work of Gordon Rhea."
1,quality is a problem!,"This device is just lasting about a month, then video output is a problem. Usually products Amazon carrying are OK level for quality, but this is first time I had a bad experience."
2,Spend a few more dollars and get a brand name.,"I regret trying to save a little money by purchasing this model. It's okay for some discs, but any DVDs made by Universal show up blurry and wavy, and anything from Lion's Gate has the brightness fading in and out in ten second intervals from bleached out to almost black. Save yourself some money in the long run and buy a system from a more famous company."
1,A waste of money!!!,"The so-called ""User's Manual"" is miniscule and shows no connection for cable! Batteries supplied with remote control were dead - must be three or four years old! The only way I'll ever get it to work is to hire a technician! I'm surprised Amazon would carry this kind of junk!!!"
1,you don't even get what you pay for,"I only watch movies once in blue moon, and so didn't want to invest in a fancy dvd player. I've had the product for half a year, and only watched a dozen or so movies in that time. And it is no longer working. Not to mention that I had to exchange the first one they sent me (wasn't working at all). The second one only lasted 6 months, and didn't work right either. I agree with another reviewer that brightness keeps going from very bright to very dark every 10 seconds or so, with most dvds."
2,Poor performance,"This device doesn't tells you if it is on or off. The red light is always on, even the DVD is off. Its hard to view a movie: always fails the image, cutting scenes or jumping without any previous notice. It is a piece of crap."
1,Piece of Junk,"Started having problems after a year. DVD wouldn't play. When I attempt to play, it keeps flipping between 'Loading' and 'Open' for a while and finally it'd eject the DVD."
3,A mixed bag,"A 1983 collection of material on war in the future, starting off with a prequel of the ""Mote in God's Eye"". Mostly short stories, but also a few poems and a few technical weaponry essays. The quality of the stories varies, but there are a lot of classic names here. Also includes ""Ender's Game"" (the original short story)."
3,Introduction to War,"The book is an anthology of short stories and theses on war and it's many aspects. From amazing stories of battles and leaders such as ""Ender's Game"" and ""Ranks of Bronze"" to delightful looks at who the victors in war are and what they receive in ""The Battle"", mixed in with non-fiction reports on war, the military, and it's technology, this book covers a lot of ground. I gave it three stars simply because I wish I would have read it when it was first published and the non-fiction was more relevant to the status of the world and its military situations."
1,Just Another Sexist Male Fantasy,"First of all, the Russian women fighter pilots were never a secret. And second, the true stories of the courageous women are interesting in and of themselves. Why do we need another sexist-male-ain't-never-gonna-happen fantasy? Lilya Litviak had the short dramatic life that Hollywood dreams about. Her father was executed as an enemy of the state during the Purge. Lilya had to keep this secret or face banishment from society, not to mention flying, which she loved. Was posthumously awarded Russia's highest honor. She went from enemy of the state to Hero of the Soviet Union in about 5 short years. She was 22 years old when she died. Why can't we just tell the truth?"
5,Fiction at its Best,"I thoroughly enjoyed this World War Two novel which is written in traditional style which I find so easy to read. It is fast moving with vivid action and soft romance, tying folklore and historical facts into a fine story. Great stuff."
2,not exactly from scratch.......,"Serious bakers and anyone concerned about preservatives and artificial ingredients might be interested to know that many of the recipes in this book call for items such as:boxed cake mixpackaged frostingcanned chocolate syrup7UPbrownie mixprepared pie crustpudding mixfrozen whipped toppingI wish I'd carefully read the book description, which does mention that ""some even use cake mixes as their starting point.""That said, there are some creative combinations and the author does seem like an awfully nice person. It's just not a book for everyone."
4,"A summary, not a storybook","I read this book aloud for my tween sons, who are Star Wars fans. The book doesn't flow like a story, but is more like a summary/overview of the three most recent Star Wars films. The best aspect of the book are the color photographs - one big picture (or two smaller pictures) on each page.The least fortunate aspect of the book is that it's mostly for hard-core fans with a good memory, or for those who've seen the films recently. I found that the part of the book I enjoyed the most, was about the plot I remember the best - the circumstances around Luke and Leia's birth and what happened to them later. The rest of the book would have been more enjoyable if we'd seen the films recently or used the book as a film companion."
1,Bad! Bad! Bad!,"A cheap straight to video movie that is sure not worth what it's selling for. Very much a movie for those not interested in the storyline & just wanting to watch Ice-T, I really am lost for words on this one :)"
3,Gangland,This had the possibility of being a first rate post-apocolyptic film except for the lack of even an inkling of believability. The fight scenes were painful to watch in that it was easy to follow the choreography before the punches were thrown.Ice-T and Coolio played the most realistic characters with exceptional delivery. The remainder of this offering is lacking in ad nauseum.
5,Omega 3 Awesome Supplement,"I love Omega 3, and this supplement does what it's suppose too. I feel great and will definitely buy more when my bottle is reaching it's end."
4,GREAT FOR SKIN AND NAILS,"After using the gel tablets as directed, I noticed my nails were growing stronger and longer. Also my complextion had a healthy glow."
4,Satisfied,"Excellent deliverly time, product arrive in good condition, I receive what I expect. I'll recommend them."
2,Boooooooorrrrriiiinnngggg,"This might have been funny and edgy maybe 30 years ago, but Jackie's continual usage of racial profiling and stereotypes has been done to death. Plus, he's not particularly clever or breaking any ground. Boring."
2,It burns,This has an irritating ingredient in it and is not good for cuts and burns like other aloe gel. It stings a lot when I put it on a cut or raw area.It does work for very minor irritations and itchy skin. I will use something else in the future though.
5,Remarkable rendition of Schumann's Davidsbundlertanze!,"This album contains a truly brilliant account of the Davidsbundlertanze--a work of such inexhaustible depths that over time one may well come to consider it Schumann's greatest masterpiece. Yerzhanov plays passionately and with extraordinary facility in a recording of crystal clarity. His piano sound is glorious and his phrasing and dynamics are superb. This performance deserves to stand alongside Pollini's equally great account. The Sonata and the Gesange der Fruhe (said to be related to Holderlin's ode 'Des Morgens') are also fine, but the Davidsbundlertanze is outstanding."
2,Some basic and slower,"PRO: This is a basic translator for people that just need find one or two meanings by word, the keyboard has a good size for the size of the translator. The influebce tool is good, it give you the means of many verbs in all tenses and in three modes.CON: English and Spanish are complex languages and many words have many meanings, also some words have idiomatic meanings, this translator give you a maximun of three meanings for some words, is some slower, take 3 seconds for some words, and the menus are some difficult to use."
1,over-hyped product,"This translator claims to have 4 million bi-directional words. So I assumed this would be plenty to use as a dictionary. I am reading a good book by Perez-Reverte and I was hoping this would speed up my dictionary searches. I would say on average that 1 word out of ten registers. I'm mad and I want my money back. or applied to a better product. Are you reading this, Seiko?"
3,Good second novel,"Mike Dime is an excellent first book and it is a first book. Barry Fantoni turned out a good ""first"" and had he continued would probably have become an outstanding writer. His second and most recent novel, published in 2012 may turn out to be the first in a series that proves Fantoni's talents."
5,LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF RAINBOWS,"POPPED THIS WONDERFULL CD IN ,AND LET IT SPIN RAINBOWS OF STRONG LYRICAL HARMONIC SPECTRUMS OF UPLIFTING ROCK SOLID TUNES ONE AFTER THE OTHER. THIS STUFF IS NEW, THIS IS NOW, THIS IS REAL, THIS IS DEEP, THIS IS ART, THIS MY FRIENDS IS MUSIC.FRESH REAL RAW YET WARM, THIS IS LIKE AN AURAL SORBET FEST.GRAB A SPOON!!!"
4,An unbelievable inside look at an R.C.M.P. investigation,"I normally don't read books of this nature, but I found this one of the most captivating and suspensful books I've ever read. Mark Murphy takes the reader on a journey with the inside life an R.C.M.P. officer focusing on one main goal - ""putting bad guys in jail"". He offers a chronological account of his dealings with an ex-Satan's Choice biker so that the reader is quickly flipping pages to find out what will happen in the next day, hour, and even minute. This book provides a surprising insight to R.C.M.P. life - painting a vivid picture of what risks actually go along with the job. It was very easy to read, although it was difficult to keep all the names straight. The thing I liked most of all was that each sentence was very personal and straighforward without imagery or fancy words to get the point across. This is definitely a job well done!"
2,Boring,I found this book to be very boring in spots. It took forever to get to the point. Kept repeating over and over.
1,Dull,"If you are looking for something new it is not here. I think I have seen this story in a few different movies. Maybe the title of the book was more talking about the author then the story. Anyway this one is really just flat, nothing exciting or new."
5,Wonderful,This CD is truly wonderful. It feels like home and makes me glad to be alive. It touches on so many feelings and experiences of life that you know you aren't alone in anything. You can understand all the lyrics and the jacket gives you some of the stories behind the songs. I highly recommend it.
5,Greatest history book of two great electric railways.,"I had bought original book about 1973, poured over the photos, read and and re-read the history. In 1983, I lent it out and lost it (not returned by a co-worker). This replacement is everything the original was, both book and dust cover are in very good condition, as described by seller. It's nice to re-board the electric cars I rode as a kid. Re-visiting these photos after 27 years, I can smell the gear oil and hear the grind of traction motors...."
2,"They say weapons, they mean guns","This book will be very helpful to someone needing correct information about guns. It is completely worthless to those of us (like me) who picked it up believing that it would touch on all sorts of weapons - knives, swords, bows, etc. I know they are targeting mystery writers, but not all mystery writers want a gun-toting suspect."
5,Amazing story,"Great book, George Sigler is truly a modern day adventurer. Although it is about the serious topic of survival, the author wanting to test his survival kit on a real-life situation, George has managed to tell his story in this very entertaining, and sometimes hilarious, book. He is, and we are, lucky he survived to tell the story."
1,Sucks!,This product is such a gimmick. It doesn't do anything. It tingles when you put it on and that's it. I'm going to return this. Nivea and St. Ives work exactly the same for $12 instead of $75..
1,Beware - weight gain,"I gained 7 lb after using this product. I'm very fit and exercise consistently but just wanted to smooth the back of my thighs. I saw little to no results, plus gained weight -- very disappointed."
1,-1 if I could!! Stay away from this stuff.,"If you like dealing with shady companies and using junkie products, you will love cellulean. Bottom Line: This stuff does not work and the company was impossible to deal with."
1,Worthless,"There is nothing magical about this product. I used this every day for a month and have seen no improvement. If they said this helped reduce cellulite, it's probably from all the massaging you had to do. And if that is the case, you're better off buying a cheaper, better smelling lotion. I personally like St.Ives Cellulite Shield. It smells great and it can be used as an all around lotion. The Cellulean is a sticky gel and smells like a dentist office."
1,Not for runners,"I went to bed. The next morning I got up an ran about 3 mi. I do not have a model body which is why I was shopping for cellulite creams. When I run my legs rub together. This is not a lotion it is a gel like substance and no amout of rubbing this product in will make it non sticky. Well after I ran, after putting this product on 12 hours before I ran, I had the worst runners rash between my legs from my legs sticking together as I was running. I would rather give up this expensive lotion that probably dosen't work anyway than give up running which has been proven to work for weight loss and cellulite."
1,Cellulean,"It causes a coating on your skin that peals off, I don't see where it is helping. I used it daily. I would not buy it again.Cellulean (6 oz.) Anti-Cellulite Treatment"
1,Bad does not work,I used this product for 3 months. I stop drinking soda I started to eat healthy to get my cellulite gone and I have not yet seen any results. I cancel it because is a rip off don't buy...
1,Don't Get Your Hopes Up!,"The product leaves a sticky feeling. I didn't see any results. I drink water all day long, worked out in fitness classes 4 days a week, had ample cardio, and was on a balanced diet. I don't eat red meat or pork, and didn't everything to improve my circulation. This product did not to aide my cellulite lose! Don't waist your time or money!"
1,weight gain!,"I used the Cellulean gel for 1 week and, at first, saw my skin was smoother and firmer... Then, I found it made me gain 7 lbs! I have not gained any weight in over a year (my weight is stable) and after using this product GAINED 7 lbs in ONE WEEK! A week after I stopped using it the weight is still there so it is not just water weight... I also noticed I now have a lot more cellulite than before! This is scary--the product not only did not work but had the opposite effect it was supposed to. VERY disappointed.LipoSculpt (which has no smell really) worked well for the abs but not for the thighs. The only product that works well for the thighs (but is sticky, stains, & smells bad) is Dermalin APG by Klein & Becker, which seems to have been sold to Nutrasport and relabeled as Cutting Gel. I will be going back to using Dermalin despite the smell & consistancy because it works."
1,Poor customer service,"Not only did Cellulean NOT have the desired affect, but the company has terrible customer service. They refused to stand by their 100% satisfaction guarantee. Stay away from Cellulean!!"
1,Not Very Impressive,"I have tried several cellulite-redcucing products, and have to say, I do not love this one. It has a menthol smell, like a sports cream, and it leaves a grimy/pastey residue on your skin. I've been using it for over a month with no noticable change in the appearance of my thighs. I think the far less expensive Loreal Sublime Slim is much better overall. Thankfully, I did not pay full price for this-got it unopened from EBAY."
1,"terrible waste of money, terrible customer service","I bought on a free trial - only paying for shipping but somewhere in the small print it stated that they will resend it every month and charge me 80euros. When I realised I complained and asked for a refund and they ignored my first three e-mail until I said I work with the media and then they were very rude and refused the refund. I shouldn't have been so stupid to think anything was free. AVOID this product, it doesn't work and it's a con."
5,APC Back-UPS,"Easy to hookup, no problems. The readout seems to be working as advertised. I have 4 different APC models, I""m curious as to which will perform the best."
4,Marvelous edition!,"A great work from Judd Appatow, Baruchel, Hunnam, including various from Freaks and Geeks (another Appatow work).A deluxe edition with a very tremendous trouble: No one type of subtitle, no english, no spanish, nothing!... Just Closed captioned...Includes two never-before-aired episodes.Bad cancellation..."
5,"""Undeclared"": Don't let it be undiscovered.","An early Apatow masterpiece, completely misunderstood by the brainless major networks. It's ""Freaks and Geeks"" go to college. Don't miss it."
4,"Not quite 'Freaks and Geeks', but still very appealing","From Judd Apatow, of 'Freaks and Geeks' and '40-Year Old Virgin' fame. Not up to the high level of 'Freaks', which perfectly captured high school (at least the era that I was there). But still an entertaining comedy with some smart writing, a good cast of characters, and some genuine laugh moments. Also, perfect for airplane watching."
5,Best Show EVER!!!,"This show is hilarious and it's a shame it was cancelled. The collection is great and I would recommend this to anyone who is thinking about going to college, currently in college, reflecting on their time in college, or just wondering what the whole college experience is about."
4,Goofy And Hilarious,"What a great cast of outsiders and people you root for to excel throughout their lives. The only annoying character was ""Hal"" (father of Steven). I could have done without his antics. It's too bad Fox ruined the show by airing the episodes out of order and not giving it a chance.It is cool to see an early Seth Rogen establishing his brand of humor. Judd Apatow (creator) was a pretty cool guy for consistently giving ""nobodies"" and ""outcasts"" steady work. This has a lot of cool extras, including a Q & A section with some of the cast."
3,Maybe it's just me but...,"I have this DVD set and I absolutely love it. However the one I have seems to have all the episodes mixed up. I put in disc 1 and selected the Play All feature, figuring I'd watch the first couple of episodes. Well the pilot was first, but from there the episodes were scattered throughout the remaining discs. Maybe it's just my set but I wanted to let it be known, it's a pain in the butt to deal with finding what disc the next episode is on, changing the disc, going to episode guide, etc..."
4,ok but NOT freaks and geeks,PROS:__This show is cute.__I LOL many times.__It's entertaining.__Good extra features included.__Worth watching!CONS:1- NOT freaks and geeks (which was GREAT)._______Undeclared is fluff tv................... - (unlike F&G;)_______female characters are weak.......... - (unlike F&G;)_______95% from male POV.................... - (unlike F&G;)_______didn't relate to anything in my life. - (unlike F&G;)It is good. It's just not GREAT.
2,i'm declared...2 stars,"the show started ok, but midway into the second disk, the shows started to have a sameness to them and i got bored. it was fun to see some of the cast of the 40 yo virgin in the series, but overall, if noone ever saw or heard from this series again, civilization will go on just fine."
2,Not Good...save your money please!!!,First off I like to say I LOVED freaks and geeks. I bought this because alot of the same actors were in it and judd wrote it. But changing the comedy into a half hour show and not having that comedy/drama or ok to sum it up The Show is just NOT FUNNY. God help me watch the rest of this because I will I paid for the set so ill watch it looking forward to the one with will ferrel if i make it that far.
3,Question,What is the name of the music played at the beginning of the movie? During the dream of the plane crash?
1,la bama rules but...,hey the cd and movie is great but theres a song on the radio when bob is fixing his car and on the radio right before thay annocend that thay were killed thes a song playing that goes (over the mountians across the sea0and i dont know it i want to know hwo sings it and the name of the song
3,"Answer to October 16, 2001 question","The song is called Sleepwalker by Johnny and Santos. Played while Esai Morales is running up the hill, and screaming Ritchie.Hope you can get a copy. Great song."
5,The greatest soundtrack ever!,"Ever since I was a little kid, this has been my favorite CD. It is clearly the best soundtrack of all time. Los Lobos does a great job of redoing Ritchie Valens' classic rock songs. Marshall Crenshaw, who plays Buddy Holly, also does a great job with his song. If there is one CD to buy, this is it. Every song is great. Watch the movie also."
3,Brilliant movie - OK covers,"This is not really the music used in the movie. Rather cover versions of the songs used in the movie. And they're all well-performed, keeping close to their originals."
4,the best ever soundtrack,"i remember watching this movie as a kid and listening to my parents vinyl record of this soundtrack. it is such a good c.d and the movie helps make it that. the only down side to the c.d. is that i don't really fancy the song ""who do you love"" as it doesn't really fit in with the rest. and i to wish that the instrumental at the end of the movie was included. all in all a great party c.d. as well as an good general listening c.d."
5,Great Oldies,"This CD is full of great oldies including many great Ritchie Valens songs. ""We Belong Together"" is my favorite."
2,A Waste of Money,"I had read ""The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying."" I bought this CD assuming it would add something to the book, but it didn't even manage to bring out the ideas that were in the book. It was just a speech. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't buy it."
1,"Ramblings, Ramblings, Ramblings",You can buy Sogyal Rinpoche's excellent book but don't waste money on any of his tapes. He just rambles on aimlessly and pointlessly in the tapes. When he starts to say something important he starts to mumble and talk fast. He is mostly into telling jokes and being entertaining. Save your money especially on this one. This is even worse than his eight audio CD set.
5,"Living well, Dying well","This author is the best writer in Orient, this book can help many people in the word.CordiallyJGHCH"
3,I like it but...,I like this product but I doesn't stick to the bottom of the shower like I would hope. You want it to suction so you can really drag your foot across it and sometimes it comes undone and starts to move.
2,Not the Full,I purchased this product and was supposed to recieve two bottles and only recieved one so I cant even try the product because I have to send the one back that I received.
5,Excellent blend of alt country and rock,"Very sound album, definately their strongest work. Rediscovered this gem recently when I found a box of old cassetes from my college days. Gave it one listen and went out immediately to buy it on CD. Still sounds as fresh and energetic today as it did 20 years ago. If you like the alt country midwetern bar band sound, I stongly suggest you give it a listen."
4,not has good has puzzle league,"but if your sick of puzzling pokemon then the doctor is in. Dr.mario is good for some incredibley nostalgic fun. besides for a few graphical differnces they have manage to keep dr.mario intact, and even added a few new ways to play. They even kept the same music in it. If you liked the NES or game boy version Dr.mario 64 should be on your list."
3,It is Ok,Well I rented DR.Mario 64 at the video place its ok if you like a tetris.It is a good rainy day game but it just wasn't that fun for me.But don't let my opinion change yours.You may like it:)
2,Save your money,"The only reason I play this game is because it's pretty addictive; however, it has many flaws: The music is extremely annoying, the sound effects aren't at all notable, you hardly get any points for clearing viruses, you get no points for just matching 4 regular pieces, and the graphics on this game are no different from the regular Nintendo. Come on; this is supposed to be a newer and better game system! They made Super Mario 64 look a lot different and better from the original, so why couldn't they have improved this game?"
4,"Very good, suits the movie vey well","The music is very well written, orchestration is ok. The singing could have been done with a better voice, but the voice used brings something to the song as well."
2,Woops,"One of my favorite movies of all time, and the soundtrack WITH the movie is good. However, alone, there are just too many ""weird"" and disconnected portions of the music that are not necessarily pleasant on their own. There are some instances of ""oh, I remember when"" while listening, but overall I was disappointed with this soundtrack. So was my wife for who I bought this as a gift. Gets overall good reviews though so that's just two peoples opinions.Try listening to the samples available and downloading the MP3's of just the songs you like; I wish I'd done that."
2,if you like creepy fantasy keyboard music you'll love it.,"I bought this because I loved the movie and alot of Knopfler's guitar work in it. What I didn't failed to remember is that 90% of the movie contained strange fantasy keyboard sounds accompanying the scenes...and so that's what 90% of this soundtrack is. It fits with the movie, but for my tastes, not as music to listen to independently. I guess it's not bad, I just bought it for Knofler's guitar work and there simply isn't alot of it."
2,Synthetic - Dragged film down,"I'm not completely sure why other reviewers here have called this soundtrack ""Deeply orchestral"" and are praising its complexity. It is clearly the product of one man at a synthesizer. The only thing holding this movie back from unimaginable greatness (in my opinion), is the awful, synthetic soundtrack. I can only imagine that the budget was blown on the visuals and so they had to cheap out and fill up the audio track with this garbage. Sad."
5,Perfect!,This has got to be one of the very best soundtracks that I have ever heard. It fits perfectly with the movie. Florin Dance is so much fun to listen to! I can't help but tap my feet whenever it is playing. If you are into the middle ages or that type of music than you have to get this soundtrack. And even if you haven't you should get this CD. It is truly wonderful!
3,"A mildly good compilation - enough JB/CT stuff to make it interesting, but...","Good Girls Go To Heaven, Bad Girls GoEverywhere? Ya gotta be kidding! It isnice to hear Next Position Please andStanding on the Edge here together!Ah, the Jon Brant Days in Cheap Trickwere just too short. Tom Petersson,nice guy (his lunatic fringe fan clubtells me), better than average Bassplayer, but brings nothing creative tothe band musically. All post-Jon BrantCT lps are just not the same withoutJon's Genious which can be heard onLeslie Gore, Robert Gordon, Jason &the Scorchers, Pete Special and othersworks. Don't miss the chacne to get'89's Siren, ""All is Forgiven"". It'smind bending! Chao! Aloha and Auf Wiedersehen!"
4,Invaded by God,This book is very good for those who are contemplative prayer people. I would recommend this for specific people of prayer
4,4 1/2 stars,"The talented Authors that put this book together combined to make a story that was very entertaining. Fast paced, non-stop readability! Sometimes erotic, sometimes violent, often darkly humorous. This is the rare gem that you'll likely read in a day, whether your a golfer or not. Unique characters along with a great story and locale bring this very original book together nicely.Highly recommended"
3,"Golf Book Teetering on the edge of being ""great""","My opinion shifts each time I think about this book. Liked, in fact, thoroughly enjoyed parts of it. Shmuck in places got in the way for me personally, while others might just like it because of its raw side. Golf story was intriguing, although the detective plot overrode any golf in too many places."
2,Eh.....,"This was a goofy book that came up on an Amazon search of ""Scottish Golf History"".... Perhaps I should blame myself for not realizing what I ordered....nah'. This is an oddball story...."
2,Wha?,"This group-written book has two things going for it: Colorful characters and a promising plot. But that's about it. Wading through several chapters to get to Dave Barry's part in this fiasco was a waste of time otherwise. While the characters are certainly vivid, NONE of them are likeable. At all. ZERO. To top it off there are more F-bombs here than a def jam hosted by Chris Rock, and not nearly as many laughs. The handoff from one writer to the next is sometimes fairly smooth, but the writing styles sometimes vary so wildly that one wonders if one is still reading the same book from one chapter to the next, and it's intended to tell one cohesive story, not be a collection of shorts. Pass on this."
3,Off to a running start; stumbles at the finish.,"I thouroughly enjoyed the first three quarters of this book, written in the style of Naked Came the Manatee. But unlike Manatee, where the concluding author made a genuine effort to wrap up the various plot lines to a more or less reasonable and satisfying conclusion, here the final author flies away from the plot and established themes to a most dissappointing and disconnected ending. All in all, however, the book is very entertaining and genuinely funny, and is well worth the read despite the conclusion."
1,An Embarrassing Mess,"I picked this book up at the library because I love golf and its literature and because I saw the names of two fine authors, Tim O'Brien and Richard Bausch, associated with the project. All I can say after spending a few hours reading this piece of junk is that they should be ashamed of themselves for being a part of it. The characters are cartoonish, the plot is ridiculous and incomprehensible and the writing appalling. This is supposed to be a comic novel, but I don't recall that I laughed one time reading it. I guess there would be some justification for a self-indulgent piece of foolishness like this if the proceeds from sales were going to some worthy cause, but there's no indication of that that I could see. The true crime here is that a worthy book probably was cast aside by the publisher in favor of this drivel."
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing,"My daughter sent me this book for Fathers Day, what a mistake ! I quess she didn't read the other reviews before ordering. I hope you don't make that mistake. I forced myself to read it, just in case she asked me any queations. This book will not see the light of day on my bookshelves. Spend your money on something else."
1,Big disappointment,In spite of the bunch of big name humorist authors this book isa total flop. The humor is almost exclusively at the level of anearly adolescent boy and the continuous use of sexual insults and filthy language makes for very tiresome reading What little plot there was couldn't save the project. I am sorry I wasted my time and money on this book.
2,OK - but that's it,"We use these in a very busy restaurant. For us these typically last about 2 years before the button stops working on them. There is a new type that I like better that doesn't go all the way around your ear. The new ones feel better as they hook just from the top of the ear. Had 2 of another type also, the one with the bud in the ear and the buttons also pooped out on those - one after 4 years, the other after 2 years.All in all they're OK but consider them ""disposable."" The multi-charger I rated as a one star but the walkies themselves are AWESOME. We have some that are 5 years old and still have the same batteries and work fine."
4,works great!,"I use it at work. The ear piece is flexible so it bends around your ear, if needed or you may cut it if you have bigger ears but its size is great for me. My only issue is being a processing line operator, around machinery the wire hanging from the ear piece tends to get caught on things and pull the earpiece off my ear."
1,usual motorola quality i've found,"Work great, for about 2 weeks. Then it wouldn't let me call out. Sound quality is great. I can see it being uncomfortable for long periods on someone with larger ears. This is the third motorola product in a row I have purchased that didn't even make it a year. Their cheaper products are just that, cheap. If you want it to last a while you have to purchase their higher quality products. I now have a Yuasu model that I bought used. It works much better."
4,So far so good - uncomfortable for some people after extended wear,"We purchased several of these for use at our veterinary hospital and kennel. So far we have been pleased with the headsets. They definitely make the radios easier to use in noisy environments. Some of our staff members have found them uncomfortable after extended wear - this has not been an issue for me personally. We have only been using them for a couple months, so it's to early to comment on their durability."
5,Riveting biography and writing,"I'd recommend this book not ""only"" because of the great information on Churchill's life struggles and events. I'm recommending this book mainly due to the writer's superb writing. I never thought I'd read a biography in one sit. You just can't stop reading, your eyes roll through the text with so much ease and pleasure. You feel Churchill's hardships, his courage, his character. Great book."
4,"Topical, but informative and interesting","An very good look into the man, the legend. We see a part of his character that is not often spoken of - his spiritual beliefs. Additionally, there's much detail regarding his troubled youth that allows for understanding of the man. It's hard not to love anything that further details one of our greatest heroes of history."
3,Broken lens - did not bother mounting,Purchased these for my Dozer but when it was delivered with a large crack across one of the lenses I figured I would not bother. I could return them or order another but decided to go a different route. A little more packing in the box would have saved me some inconvenience. I am a loyal Northern customer but things like this do not help the relationship!!
2,paint by number,"I thought this was REALLY fun to paint. It isnt durable at all, though. It is made out of different material than regular breyers (kind of glass like). So don't buy this if you want to play with it afterwords. I accidently gave mine a REALLY light touch to a chair, and the leg came off. But it is VERY fun to paint!"
5,A Fortunate Life,"The story of Albert Facey's life is one of the most inspiring, poignant biographies I have ever read. He endured personal and physical trials that would have made others buckle under, but he always kept his sense of proportion--and humor.I feel fortunate that an Australian friend sent it to me to read and will recommend it to my friends."
5,easily worth $8,"Drew is a great musician and his brilliance is reflected in his music. On top of that he is a really great person, purchase his EP and you won't be disappointed."
5,Delicious!!!,"Drew Gasparini is quite an artist. His style is far from what I usually listen to, ""my style"" being that of metal [yes, METAL], but all it took was his outstanding voice and guitar, and I was hooked! He is by far one of the most talented artists I've heard. This winter break, I am driving approxiametly 16 hours to see him LIVE! If Small Thoughts is not on your list of buys, you will be missing out!"
1,Disapointment,"I'm Very Disapointed with this game, the graphic's leave a lot to be disiaired. I'm very surprised Cabela's would put their name on it. It is so Fake."
1,incorrect cover!!!!!!,"I love this series.... I had to order a replacement book but the cover doesn't match!! I know it is petty, but if you collect series you typically want the cover that matches the rest. instead of the proud girl with straight blonde hair with a raku in the back ground... i got a pouty woman with curly hair wear a ball gown (A BALL GOWN!!!!!!!!! ugh!!!) oh come on at least hold true to the series... this is going in the garage sale box as soon as i find a cover that matches the rest! its a good series... but if you already have some of them, you'll be disappointed in the art work on the new covers"
3,May be better for Teens?,"#3 in a 4 part series. I love Kim Harrison who is a pen name of Dawn Cook's. This particular series was just ok since I am used to the fast paced, complex stories that Kim writes."
5,Excellent story,This entire series is wonderful! I absolutely love it! This book was fantastic. I can't wait to read the next one! I will be reading these books again!
1,Product burned...no customer service....,"After using the prepackaged packets of this product, I decided to be more ecologically minded and buy the jars. Purchased 2 jars. Product burned my nose so bad I couldn't use it. Hydromed, the manufacturer, said their 'mix' was apparently 'off' and was going to send me packets to make up for this bad product. Weeks have passed...no product has been received and no response to my inquiries. Very poor customer service. I also purchased the nasal irrgator and must admit I've not had any problems with that."
5,Works wonders for me,"I'm surprised by the negative reviews because this stuff has really helped me. I have a nasal irrigator and started out with the pre-measured packets. I found the combination of irrigating and this solution improved my chronic sinus condition by about 80 percent. Then, in an attempt to save money, I switched back to an isotonic saline solution. I found that it wasn't as comfortable, and so I tried the Breathe Ease solution in these little tubs. It's been terrific. I find I like this kit better than the packets because I also use the little spray bottle during the day. By making my own spray, I cut out the benzalkonium preservative that was in my other pre-made sprays--and which was probably making my sinus condition worse without my being aware of it."
5,Best album by don carlos,this is the best compilation by don carlos if you find this in a store it will prolly be more expensive than getting the mp3 album but either way when im on pandora i go to don carlos radio because this album always comes up and i just sit there and vibe ....and im like wow don carlos is so influential and smooth vocals on top of some real heavy rasta roots music 70's stylee its don carlos AT HIS BEST i love don carlos and love reggae music so do yourself a favor and buy this album you will love yourself after you buy it
5,Simply wonderful,"This book is simply wonderful--moving, funny, uncompromisingly intimate and honest. The author has revealed her inner self to the reader--with all the ups and downs of real life. As characters in the book, the husband and wife pass through stages in which they evolve and reach a higher level of perception of the other. It reads like a novel, only better, because there are no pat answers and formulaic denouements in what is simply a story about the demands the realities of life make on two intelligent, sensitive and mature adults. This book is meaningful not only for prostate cancer survivors but for so many of us who are going through the changes aging makes in us and in the ways we relate to one another."
2,Bad performance,"20-Mile Range is just a joke. No more than half a mile. I tested it out at different conditions(beach, forest, city, shopping mall). The best usage at shopping mall, but in this case you don't need to buy product for $60.When you press buttom to talk, it's not ready to work immediately and people on the other side are not able to hear you."
2,bad for headsets,if you want a decent headset one that works with a helmet for get it because this has a single pin connection and helmet headsets all that i found were two pin connections the radio itself works greats but not much in the line of helmet headsets
4,Awesome 2-way,"Battery lasts much longer than my old audiovox radio. The only negative I've experienced so far is you need to really press hard on the keys/buttons, other than that this is an awesome 2-way radio."
5,Great Radios,These radios worked as advertised. Very clear. A great way to keep in touch with your kids.
4,Better than most,We have found that this radio is better than most that would fall in to this size and type. Good buy for the money.
4,Good for around the farm,We have a farm that is located in a cell phone dead zone. When my wife tries to call me for lunch or to check on me when I am in the field the phone will not work. We read the reviews on the Cobra LI 6500-2 and decided to give them a try. We have tested them from 10 miles out and they will not cover that distance around here but luckily my farm is not near that size. I can get reception from about 2 to 5 miles depending on trees and hills and that is enough. They are easy to use and the price was right for our limited use. The call function is great and the size is great. The channels come in clear but be warned 20 miles is a long way. They might work on water but not in the hills.
2,Cheap plastic,"I opened the box and then proceeded to place the battery into the back as instructed. The clip that holds the radio to your pocket or belt loop breaks off right away. I purchased these radios for a long move from Texas to Washington state that was coming up in 4 days. I called Cobra customer services to ask for a new clip and they said they would replace it no problem but it would not reach me before the trip. I take them anyway.The first day of the trip the other clip breaks in half! This all happened weeks ago and I still have not received the promised replacement clip for the first one.What idiot designed this clip? The one part of the radio that is most likely to receive high pressure is designed with brittle plastic!Not worth the cost at half the price.Oh, and the 20 mile range? Out in the middle of Texas on an open highway with no obstructions.....maybe 3/4 mile before it starts to break up."
3,ok,"bought to replace older motorola talk abouts. product worked well, but no better than less expensive motorola. features of radio such as calls also not compatible with all of the channels using motorola.all in all satisfied, but feel could have bought less expensive radios and had same performance."
3,Cobra LI 6500,"Well, I used it extensively this past weekend, as we did a lot of backpacking. I certainly did not get 20-mile service with it. Often the other scouts who had other radios from other brands got better reception than I did with the Cobra. Often the incoming message was more easily received on other radios than the new Cobra that I had. There are many settings that I'll have to play with to hopefully improve the performance."
2,Not too pleased!,I was pretty disappointed with the radios. We tried to use them by our hunting shack and we couldn't even hear each other when we were about a mile apart. I really think that when they say a 20 mile radius that they are deceaving the customer.
3,don't bother using them in the city,"radios were good on a cruise, but horrible in the big city, maybe only a 4 block radius"
2,Codra LI 6500-2,Dead on arrival the base charger was the problem the radios use a rechargeable battery so the charger is critical for operation.
2,Battery Availability Problem,"I am a 61 year old widow and live by myself near the Gulf coast. I purchased these radios (Mode LI6000, same battery packs) to use for communication with my ""neighborhood watch group"" in the event of a hurricane or severe weather. I never used the units, purchased 2 years ago, so I can't comment on their range or capability. However, I realized recently that the batteries needed replacing. It appears, from my research, that the batteries that come with these units are propriatary - only Cobra seems to stock them. It also appears that the batteries are generally ""Out of Stock"" with Cobra, and in stock, cost $19.95 each. So I am looking for a new set, but I will not repurchase the Cobra MicroTalk model, due to the replacement battery cost and the lack of availability."
4,"High Performance, Light Weight Radios",Good build quality and excellent performance in heavily wooded parks. I am satisfied with the range (varies with terrain and structures). The rechargeable batteries and charging stand are very convenient. Privacy codes go a long way to ensure clear communication without interference from other users. Radios are light and rugged -- the only thing that would make these better is if they were waterproof. Excellent deal on Amazon!
4,fantastic achievement,"ever since their debut cd ""blush"" this band has remained one of the best kept secrets in the music industry today and their sophomore effort ""cassidy"" is nothing less than stunning in terms of their superb ability to incorporate complex texture and rhythmic layers this band has found a unique voice that makes them stand out from the rest of the trip-hop/electronica bunch which is an acute sense of melodies and a wonderful mixture of atmosphere and substance to make this band a well-rounded musical wonder so long story short this is a fantastic achievement by one of the most under-heard bands on earth today and thank you for reading by the way don't forget to go out and get the cds by ALPHA they are brilliant."
2,Cassidy but no Casanova,"European quirk-tronica can only go so far. Unfortunately Bows missed that memo. I am not sure what happened between their much-heralded debut, 1999's Blush, and their new record, Cassidy, but somewhere somebody missed something. Perhaps I'm just not hip enough to get this record, I don't know. Bows is what Japanese mixmeister Cornelius would sound like after half a bottle of Nyquil. That's not to say front man Luke Sutherland is without talent; his would just be better served as one of Bjork's many collaborators. I kept hoping I would be rescued by the theme song to Mr. Magoo but instead was left with empty atmospherics and a Scandinavian chanteuse."
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,"Worst book on web development I've ever purchased! Don't waste your money on it.. I glanced through the book once and tossed it on the shelf and never picked it up agian. It jumps from subject to subject never throughly covering anything. If you need a book on web development, select books by Wrox Press or O'Reilly. nuf said. Well... AMAZON how do I give it ZERO STARS?"
2,Not for the beginner,Would have been a better book if it hadn't relied on interdev1 and interdev 6. Don't know anyone who would still have interdev one. NOt to bad for the more advanced.
3,A good review of web tools,"I think the book could have included more information on designing web sites. For instance, they could had elaborated more on the usage of FrontPage and Interdev. In my opinion, this book could be more indebt. And how about adding at least a few hundred pages. A fairly good book overall. That's if your needing to know what web tools are out there to use."
3,An OK read,"This book was an easy enough read. However, I found Sophie's character a little childish and Nicholas was a not a really interesting hero. The book did have some enjoyable moments though, so it gets 3 stars."
5,Catholic Life in a New Century,"I have found this book very helpful in answering questions about the Catholic faith in understandable language. It covers a variety of subjects and is a perfect gift to give to both to the ""cradle Catholic"" as well as any inquiring individual."
4,It's a good read,"Easy to understand, but lacks details that are sometimes so crucial for classes and research. However if you are a beginner- this book is for you!"
2,Ready to Yawn??,"A boring novel, Baldur's Bones is about an orphan boy who falls in love with a skull and so then a pack of rats start chasing him.It's not quite as stupid as I make it sound I guess but it is indeed boring.The back cover quoted a review that said the book was ""Unputdownable"" (and all that sort of thing)Thank Goodness Be for Amazon.At least people tell the TRUTH!As they see it..Surely, no one could REALLY think Balsur's Bones was exciting!!Give us a break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Lovely and Wonderful Stories of Another Time,"Elizabeth Choate Spykman lived from 1898 to 1956 and wrote 4 books about the Cares children, which are thought to be autobiographical. They certainly have a vividness that endears them to the imagination and to the memory and are all four intensely readable.A Lemon and a Star - 1955The Wild Angel - 1957Terrible, Horrible Edie - 1960Edie on the Warpath - 1966 (published posthumously)All are beautifully written and deserve to remain in print, and are classics in evoking their time and place."
4,good for the money,"To tell the truth it is very difficult to find good tools these days but this set is working fine. A hint: don't purchase screwdrivers with clear plastic before the steel, they break every time. This set is worth buying."
1,very poor screwdrivers,"These are some of the worst screwdrivers I have ever used. The Phillips tips don't seem to fit anything, and are quickly ruined. The flat tips twist under very little pressure."
2,Purchased same set elsewhere,"I'm done buying Stanley products... They seem nice at first, especially for the price but I've found out more than once with Stanley that you get what you pay for. As another reviewer said, Phillips bits break upon mildly more than light use and don't seem to fit a whole lot. Which is the most likely cause for the early deterioration as I would assume. I've used the flat heads much less often so I couldn't say exactly how those are but if they match the quality of the Phillips I'd invest an extra 10.00 into a much more decent set by another brand. For common light household use these might be alright. But any general automotive or outdoor use these are terrible. Just bought myself a 10pc set of Dewalt drivers at home depot for 20.00 with magnetic tips. I'm absolutely sure these will hold up much nicer"
1,Poor quality,The screwdriver tips broke on each standard screwdriver the first time I used them to install a screw. The screwdrivers are useless for any tight screw.
3,Ok for my needs,"I have been a Stanley guy for years. Normally I have great success with their products, so when I needed an inexpensive screwdriver set away from home, I ordered this.As other reviewers have mentioned, the set is made in US (portions anyway). The first thing I noticed was the very poor plastic quality on the set holder that is intended to be wall mounted. Not impressive and I have no confidence it will last.The screwdrivers are ok. I found the handles easy to hold and work with. I did not that many of the tips seems to be odd sizes compared to my needs so I wonder if I will get full use of the set. As an example, I only had one option for a flat head to remove electrical faceplates from the wall before I painted. It worked, but was not a great fit.For roughly $11 for the set it is still ok."
5,Need a Screwdriver? This Will Do the Job,"I have had this set for over 3 years now and have never had any problem with any job I ever used them on. They have performed as well or better than other more expensive sets and show little or no wear, even though I have used them on numerous varied tasks from home repair to auto repair. Not sure what more you would expect from a set of screwdrivers, the only requirement for you is to use the right size (which must be more difficult for some folks it seems). Good product and a good price and as far as I know still made in the USA."
4,Very good general purpose,good for around the house they will do anything a home owner needs to accomplish.
2,The storage rack is a JOKE!,"The screwdrivers are decent quality but it ends there. The size is not listed on the individual screwdrivers. It is listed on the cardboard backing that doesn't connect to anything, including the ""storage rack."" The storage rack is really just the packaging to ship the screw drivers, when you open it to take one out, they all fall out. It is cheap, crappy plastic and it should be considered fraud to call this a storage rack. The sizes of the screwdrivers not being listed is pretty irritating and could make them difficult to use."
4,Good Price,"There is not much to say, I preferred it because of the price and it's doing its job so far."
5,Holds its value,This product is worth the money. I had bought this as a christmas present for my dad and he still to this day uses them.
4,Around the house,"I've owned these Stanley screwdrivers for years and haven't had any issues with them. I work with computers and for opening computer cases and light household work, they do just fine. That said, I wouldn't use them in any truly demanding environment (such as auto work).The other reviewers may have a point. The may break if they've changed the manufacturing process in the last five years."
3,IT IS OK,"The screws are exactly what u see, it is a good purchase. Only that it will be packaged like a nuke. Lots of plastic bags running around, & 1 big plastic holder. They should have done better, Like a container or something"
4,Stanley,Look you can not beat the pricing and the quality of Stanley. This company has been around for years and for the money you get a good product. If your looking better for this cause you are using everyday carpentry work than spend more money and get better quality. For the typical guy for work around the house this is great.
2,very cheap set!!,"From the photo's and the reviews that I have read about these screwdrivers, I expected alot more.....What's the old saying? ""You get what you paid for!""I bought garbage!"
2,Expected better quality,"I think the price of stanley tools has come down a bit over the last few years but unfortanately, the quality of their screw drivers has too. I usually buy multiplew packs because I tend to lose tools easily or just misplace them and then I am stuck.you save decent money with the multipacks also.the problem I have is that the heads of 3 of the screw drivers stripped out prematurely and form medium to heavy use.I am not a big fan any more."
2,bad Phillips tips,"the Phillips tips are very bad, the picture has no resolution to zoom in and see how the Phillips tips are, not good at all when i'm using them.the flat tips are good."
5,Nice starter,"My husband and I are both a younger couple in our 20's really just starting out, and my husband doesn't really have any tools of his own. So this year for Christmas I decided to work on getting him a nice collection of tools. WI couldn't have found a better find for under $10. I love the variety that was included in this set and it is awesome for a starter set. It comes very well packed in bubble wrap (which I wrapped how it came tehe). Upon opening it he absolutely loved it so it was a win win. I would definitely recommend for anyone just starting out or just looking to expand their collection."
5,muy bueno,estupendo producto y marca excelente multi usos son prácticos recomendados al mil x mil para cual quier cosa del hogar
2,Cheap Screwdriver Set,"I bought these online thinking, what could make these different than more expensive screwdrivers? The handles are made of cheap plastic, and the screwdrivers just scream CHEAP!! I will probably be throwing these away as soon as I buy another set in the real near future."
3,"Screwdrivers are fine, the ""rack"" is weird","So I may have destroyed mine and that may be my fault, but it wasn't at all obvious to me how to operate and make use of the weird plastic rack these come in.They've been fine for light use, but I haven't had to use them for anything more severe. Overall, they're okay cheap screwdrivers, but not really meant for heavy duty work."
1,They will charge $0.69/minute for roaming in USA???,"I wanted to buy Verizon's this plan.But the Amazon website shows there is 0.69/minute charge for the roaming in area or US(see below).That is crazy charge!!!No any cell phone company will charge roaming fee.Is it a mistake? Or it is true?

4,I liked this as much as the first one,"I enjoyed reading the continuing story of the Kendrick family during the aftermath of the war between the states. The courage that is shown by these intrepid southerners is a remarkable thing to see. This was a very good book, and I recommend the two highly."
4,"Okay, so it's not great literature...","Is it a soap opera? Yes, but a good soap opera. Flat characters? Yes, but easily identifiable characters that are uniformly interesting.Perhaps the best thing about this trilogy is that it is written in a straightforward manner that can be understood by a fifth grader."
2,Pay attention to the dimensions!,I didn't pay attention to the dimensions and thought I had ordered a full-size backpack. That was careless on my part and I don't want someone else to make the same mistake. This bag is obviously for a kid in kindergarten.
5,Love it!,"I bought this Walkout set many years ago on cassette tape and used it a lot! I was thrilled to finally get in MP3. I have it now on my MP3 layer and it feels like an old friend, only better! Downloading was easy. I made copies both on my computer and on a DVD disk so I won't have to repurchase it if my MP3 players and computer both, fail."
1,not a good workout,Not fast enough for a good cardio workout. Maybe ok if your new to exercise but not fast enough for cardio
2,I'd look around for another laptop,"After reading all the good reviews and checking out my friends' older hp pavilions, I decided to buy this laptop. Considering this is HP's top of the line model, I am very disappointed. HP should not ship this out w/Vista knowing there are driver issues that have not been resolved yet & also knowing that there is annoying high pitch mosquito sound coming from the laptop, which is especially LOUD when not plugged into the AC adaptor. I've been told the sound is a result of the dual processor going into battery saving mode. For this price, I would go for a Macbook, or a cheaper PC laptop without Vista or noise issues. I'm still giving this laptop a 2 star because it has a very nice sleek design & it runs pretty fast."
5,Magnigicent!!!,"I had been meaning to read Sandburg's Lincoln for many years... I am so glad I finally got around to doing it. To me, and many others, this is the definitive work. It won't just sit on my bookshelf - it will be read again!"
2,bad heroine - just not likable,"I wanted to like this book. But though I guess Liam was okay, I didn't like Ellen at all. I despised her for leaving Liam to steal the heirloom - I mean, if you're going to steal something, why the exact same thing as her lover. I had problems already with Liam going to steal it, though I could nearly justify it with the back and forth the Beastie had, between the English and the Scottish Lockharts. But then Ellen's actions were truly despicable, no matter how desperate she was. And she was a pretty poor mother too.I thought long and hard about whether I thought I was being biased because of the genders, but I just really didn't like Ellen at all. Liam deserved much better. If it was me that caught up to her, I would have taken the money and maybe the kid from her and kicked her to the curb. I don't have the patience for such people."
5,fantastic!!!,This book was fantastic! Absolutely fantastic. The best book I have ever read!!!!!!!!It was so Funny!It was so sad!It was so romantic!It made me feel alive I loved it!
1,Couldn't get past the third chapter,I loooove Julia Londone but this book dragged on and on. I couldn't finish it. I rad ahead to see if it would get better...and it didn't. I wasn't even interested in the romance part because the book was so ho-hum.Yeah it was a good story but it took too long to get to the love. Her child was all over the place and she had no real character depth. I cared about Liam but I couldn't give a hoot about the heroine. I will try another book from the series though.
2,Meh,"I found the story boring and hard to finish.Also, the Gaelic wasn't all that great. An author who uses a different language should really know it or consult with someone who knows it. You can't get a foreign language right by just using a dictionary."
3,It was disappointing,"At first I thought I was really going to enjoy this book simply because I love Scottish historicals. I understand that life in past centuries was brutal at times but that does not excuse the violence toward each other by two people who are supposed to be ""in love."" The plot made no sense at all once the family heirloom had been found and obtained. I can easily understand a man really getting into being tied down for sex but I DO NOT accept nor will I ""understand"" a man violently tying up the woman he loves and essentially sexually torturing and raping her without even asking her why she was in his family home in the first place.This really soured me on this story and I don't think I want to read the others. Ms. London build the foundation of your stories a bit better and I may try to read them again. Pah!"
3,Slow and never really gets off the ground,"I read a lot of historical romances. Perhaps I want to much out of a book, but this book left me wanting for a lot of things; Like characters to like and an interesting plot.It's not that it's a horrible book, it's just not very good. I thought Liam was a little whiney and wimpy for a hero and Ellie just never made me care if she ever found love or not. I did like Nettie, but then I have a soft spot for kids.If you are looking for a slow easy read, then perhaps this is your book. If you want witty conversation and chemistry look elsewhere."
4,"Light, Good Read","I really did enjoy this book, althought I too was disappointed with Ellie's actions mid way through the book. As a mother, I understood her situation but still felt she should have been honest with him and asked for his help. Anyway, I really liked Liam's character. I really laughed at his going to the park to do hunt, clean his clothes and pick flowers. I also loved his repeated mention of being afraid of trolls. He was a truly enjoyable character and he really made the book. Can't wait to read about Grif!"
4,Nice read,"I read some of the other reviews, and clearly personal tastes play into their criticisms. Liam's character was fun and I loved the brogue. Natalie (the little girl) did live in La-La land, but that was understandable given their circumstances. Natalie's problems also set up the ""chase"". The book doesn't end, but sets up the next in the series. When can we expect that one?"
2,Not very interesting.,"I expected a lot of this book, because this author is normally very good. I was disappointed by the thin plot line, lack of depth in the characters, and the repetitive prose (if Liam referred to Ellen as an ""angel"" one more time, I was going to scream). Although there was adequate background on Ellen, we never really understood what made Liam tick. The author repeatedly referred to the fact that he was a soldier, as if that completely explained who he was. This is so different from this author's ""Regent Street"" series, where her male characters are described very thoroughly and eloquently. I hope the next books in the series will improve."
2,Highlander Confused,"Having been my first London read, I'm terribly disappointed. I wanted to like Ellie and Liam, but their storyline was too tragically provincial. There was no grand action, no real struggle for the beastie, just a seemingly incongrous character shift on Ellie's part that left me confused, not intrigued.On a high note, the ""Prologue"" was wonderfully descriptive and drew the reader into the sordid tale of the beastie. I wanted to hear more about the folklore.Although I don't want to disregard London altogether, I'm hesistant pick up another, and I will most certainly disregard the second novel in the series as Grif all ready seems to be a fop destined to waste his familial money (once they find the beastie).Tread carefully . . ."
2,This is not one of her better novels,Both the hero and the heroine were rather annoying in this one. Why did she give him such a thick Scottish accent? He sounded like a character from an Austin Powers movie.
1,This saw is a toy,"I agree with a previous review. This saw is a toy. Not only it won't last but it also can hardly be use for anything else than approximate curve cutting.The blade can't be tensioned properly. The table adjustment is approximate. The guard adjustment change when you lock it in position.Overall, of all the tool I own, this is my worst investment.UPDATE: The power switch gave up. I called the delta tech support and was surprised to have a good experience. I received a replacement switch 4 days later."
4,Christian Thriller,"Excellent thriller by novelist Ted Dekker combines elements of adventure, suspense, romance, and supernaturalism into a compelling story about a Saudi princess on the run from Islamic political conspirators and a brilliant college student with questions about God and an uncanny knack for seeing the future. Edge of your seat stuff, this one kept me up till 2:30 AM one morning and I was sad to be done with it. Great read!"
5,Absolutely Amazing!!,"Now that I've caught my breath, I can tell you that Blink is one of the most amazing (ASOLUTELY AMAZING!) stories ever written. It had everything I love in a story-- suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat, turning the pages as fast as I could, biting my nails; action that made my heart nearly leap out of my chest; romance in the perfect proportion that melted me on the inside but that was not overly sappy; solid spiritual underpinnings; a deeply encouraging message. The story is about an Arabian princess held in the bondage of that culture and the young American man who fell in love with her. They fight nearly unsurmountable obstacles to find freedom-- not just freedom from earthly oppresion, but spiritual freedom as well. This story will get into your heart and into your head. Awesome!"
5,Unlimited Suspense!,"A story about a young Saudi Arabian princess who escapes her world of veils and cruelty when she finds out she is to marry a man she has never met for the sake of the kingdom. Her importance is futile and she is searched for throught the USA. A young genuis, Seth Border, can see many potential futures and teams up with Miriam, the princess. Their story will bring you to the edge of your seat! A thriller full of suspense and drama. Follow Miriam and Seth as they discover freedom, love, and God!"
2,"Starts off well, but....","This book begins promisingly as a thriller with quite an interesting premise, but by the end disentegrates into a none-too-subtle Christian propaganda tool. In trying to integrate action and suspense with religion and prayer, the book ends up being neither a good thriller nor a convincing religious statement. There are, as mentioned some inconsistencies--in actuality, the number of possible futures would be nearly infinite--and the book definitely makes Christianity look good at the expense of Islam. Also, it contains several ridiculous cheap shots at evolution--if Seth is such a genius, why does he subscribe to this ""intelligent design"" crap?--and a ham-handed promotion of Fox News. This book actually is not a bad read for a while, but it quickly gets bogged down in religious dogma. In short, if you want good Christian writing, try C.S. Lewis; if you want a good thriller, well, take your pick. If you want a heavy-handed, clumsy combination of them, buy this book."
2,Not what it appears w/ a hidden agenda,"I picked this up in the local library, thinking it looked interesting. A modern love story with some sci-fi twists.The religion themes, at first, were fine -- after all, it's impossible to write about the Middle East without them.But by the back 2/3 of the book, when the power of the 'God of Jesus' is being rammed down my throat and the options of another god are being thrown away, I got fed up.I'm not a fan of authors who hide religious themes behind the pages of mainstream fiction. If you're going to be a 'Christian' writer, stand up and be proud about it.As for the writing, eh. It wasn't page-turning, edge-of-my-seat excitement, even before the jesus part was being rammed, repeatedly, down my throat.I wouldn't recommend this to a friend, and I won't pick up another Dekker work."
2,Needed a lot more attention,"The careless writing in this surprised me, especially in light of some of the other reviews. It seems to have been written too quickly with no attention to details. Really clumsy love story and unbelievable characters.Predictable story, too.It has its moments, but not nearly enough of them!"
2,Clumsy propaganda,"I am a devoted Christian and yet I found this book heavy handed and bigoted. The writing starts off well, and the author's research is evident. I liked the message that prayer is a powerful force, but he rapidly degrades into hitting the reader over the head with fundamentalist Christian dogma. The chasing is protracted and Seth's ability to leave Cheyenne Mt. doesn't really hold up. The plug for the Fox News network is pretty obvious and ridiculous too. Don't bother reading this book to give you any revelations about your faith or anyone else's."
1,Cover makes no mention that this is a Christian novel,"I feel kind of ripped off. I thought this was more conventional sci-fi adventure, but when the hero writes an equation in a college classroom proving intelligent design I went, uh oh. First there was no explanation of the equations, no science, it was just posited as if by magic. The whole concept of science proving there is only one ordained possible future is silly and made it very hard for me to take this seriously or even with a modicum of interest. The other part of the book dealing with the harsh world for women in Saudi Arabia was better done, but the characters seemed just that, not real people. If I could get my money back on this book I would."
1,A very terrible betrayal...,"Never in my life did I thought I would be this disappointed by a book. This story started with an interesting premise: A genius gets the ability to see all probable outcomes for every event. He uses this power to help an Arabian princess that is the target of a conspiracy. Halfway through the book, it turns out that this is a book promoting the author believes about Christianity. What a betrayal to the reader. Every writer knows (apparently not Mr. Dekker) that a reader picks up a book to be entertained; if you are going to preach your personal believes about a religion, then somewhere in the cover of the book it must say intended for a Christian audience. I felt deceived and damn glad I didn't pay for this piece of crap; I would have been very pissed if I had."
4,"Fun to Read, a little predictable","I've read a number of Dekkar's books now, and after the others I was disappointed by the predictable ending of this one. The spiritual message of this book, however, is very strong. I was encouraged and challenged in my own faith once again through a Dekkar book.Even still, I'm not much of a fictional reader, but this one kept my attention and I read the whole thing while home sicke for a couple of days. This book is about the discovery of real faith by an agnostic. The agnostic learns that a gift has been given to him by God, and when the gift is taken away, he learns that he can still trust God in faith."
3,Never used it,"I have never used this unit but I have tried many like it. Of all of these I have found that the Franklin units are the best.The Franklin TES-118 English/Spanish Translator is great. It has Advanced verb conjugation. The more expensive Franklin unit like DBE-1450 Spanish/English are better but the TES-118 is all most people will need.I don't like the multi-language like the Franklin TWE-118 5 Language European Translator, because the verb conjugations are not included and the dictionaries are a bit small. But this unit is still much better others in its class."
1,Illustrations of abysmal quality,Ridiculously poor illustrations largely consisting of simple line drawings that have the appearance of third generation photocopies.
4,Details count,"A thorough presentation on constructing portfolios and boxes. The diagrams and text explain important details like handling corners, lining the inside of boxes and keeping measurements in check for a lid to close successfully. My box-making took a leap in quality after following the tips in this book."
4,"There's no easy way to make a book, box, or portfolio","There's no easy way to make a book, box, or portfolio, but the this book is one of the best I've seen at providing instructions on doing so. As a graphic design student the instructor suggested we purchase this book to help with box and portfolio making. The instructions are very detailed, but the illustrations are not that great. So it's kind of like putting box furniture (with bad diagrams) together. The written instruction is great until you look for an inmage to verify that you are doing it correctly. With a lot of patience, practice and precise measuring and cutting you too can create an item that may be considered a work of art in itself."
3,Good as a reminder,"Books, Boxes & Portfolios: Binding, Construct and Design, Step-By-StepNot bad as a reminder for teachers and those not fully educated as a bookbinder. Serves as a reasonable text book. Expected better, but has some good hints."
4,"Great PC, but. . .","I own this model and I must say its a great PC. I dont understand what the other reviewer is talking about on (overheating) I run multiple programs on this thing daily and NO problems. I am also an intensive PC gamer and I play on this thing for hours with my newly installed 256mb PCIexpress card and NO problems. Maybe this person just happen to pick up the lemon of this models series. But I do agree 100% on the tech support issue, it can be Frustrating as Hell talking to some of these non-english speaking so called techs!!!"
3,Alright...,"I do agree about the overheating issue though,I tried playing guild wars and it overheats in less than 15. dont try to play games on the integrated graphics, im getting a 6600gt and it should run much smoother. I like that it has a pci express slot and some room for ram."
4,Fun and adventure all rolled in a cute fairy butt,This third book was awwesome! Escalla and Justicar are back most definately. The challenge of taking on Lloth and her demonic horde was both exciting and still had the sheer hilarity of the previous books. The ending was a bit much but was still true to the E&J style that's been prevalent throughout the 3 books. I can't wait to read more!!
2,"Detached narrative, no humour, low action, little insight","I can't handle all this detached, measured narrative without some insight to make it worthwhile. There is very little dialogue, no humour, hardly any action - just reams of detached description of an academically gifted child's seemingly unfortunate ambition (somewhat fuelled by misguided adults) driving him away from the joys of nature, work and friendship. Apart from, perhaps, the evangelical shoemaker there's no-one here to really enjoy being with, particularly as the condescendingly mature narrator always keeps us removed from them.The kid never really gains my great sympathy, although the story is clearly meant to be tragic. The ending bluntly nails this home with much the same shortcut predictability of a `and then I woke up' finish."
3,Beautiful cakes for the advanced cake decorator,"The book is beautifully photographed and written, however the tools and ingredients are not for beginners. Ribbons and marzipan are used frequently, rather than plain icing, and the cakes are elaborate."
4,"""Secrets"" That Antiques Dealers Dont' Share","I have dozens of different collections. I've bought from thrift stores, flea markets, yard sales, and antiques malls. Ms. McCarthy still offered me some insight into buying and selling collectibles and furniture. She covers buying antiques on the internet, making easy repairs to items you purchase, cashing in your collections, dealer's habitats, bidding and winning at auctions, and ways to tell if an item is genuine or ""fake"". There is also a listing of several antiques shops that are given according to general area of the U.S. The author includes helpful publications and resources in the back of her book. I recommend this reading to novice dealers and collectors. It's an easy and fun book to read. Keep your highlighting pen handy!"
5,Gaiman fan,It is children's stories recording by Neil Gaiman himself. I enjoyed listening to the stories in the way it was meant to be heard. My son and his class enjoyed listening to them also. At the end we are treated to an interview of Neil Gaiman by his daughter. This is a great buy.
3,Beware - Copy Protected,"Though the content of this CD is great, beware if you plan tolisten to it on your computer or your IPOD. This disk containsone of the ""copy protection"" kludges that have become popular, andcannot be played on many computer CD drives. There are ways aroundit, but it's a royal pain not to be able just to use the CD."
5,"Funny, poetic, layered. If only all kid's lit were. . .","Gaiman is a gifted storyteller, and I believe he is at his best in short genres: short stories, children's fiction, poetry. This is a well chosen collection of 4 short pieces and a charming interview (by the author's daughter daughter). Gaiman's interpretations of his work are excellent, and the whole collection left me wanting more. It's children's literature at its best, in the hands of an author who does not equate childhood with idiocy."
3,"GET ""DUBSTRUMENTALS"" INSTEAD","There is no longer any need to buy this issue of ""Kung Fu Meets The Dragon,"" let alone pay a high amount for it, as Trojan Records has released it on the collection ""Dubstrumentals."" The October 2005 Trojan release also includes two other Perry albums, so in total you get:*KUNG-FU MEETS THE DRAGON*RETURN OF WAX*MUSICAL BONESBasically with ""Dubstrumentals"" you end up getting three albums, in better sound, for the same price (or even less) as ""Kung Fu Meets The Dragon"" alone. Just wanted to make sure fellow shoppers are aware of this deal. Happy listening."
3,NOT UP TO PAR,"I count myself a big Deaver fan. I feel each of his books since the ""Bone Collector"" have shown increasing skill and maturity. ""Speaking in Tongues"" is not up to his present standards. The characters are implausible, the action is not cohesive and the pace is uneven. If this were a first novel, I'd say it showed promise, but was flawed.The first scene where daughter Meagan visits the psychiatrist is an excellent beginning: very taut using dual voices (her own and ""Crazy Megan"") to great effect. Her substitute therapist at first sounds brilliant, and then the reader gets uncomfortable. Something is *wrong* with this man. The rest of the novel does not live up to the fine first scene.Deaver's famous plot twists failed to surprise or were telegraphed. The really excessive gore reminded me of Harris' ""Hannibal;"" so over-the-top and unbelievable. A good writer, which Deaver and Harris most certainly are, does not need such crude tricks.I would sit this one out and wait for the next one."
3,Disappointed,I am a true Jeffery Deavers fan. I can hardly wait from one book to the next but this book was not one of his better books. I felt the characters and story lines were not up to his standards.
4,Good psychological suspense,"Tate Collier and his ex-wife Bett, are reunited to search for their missing daughter Megan, in this quite suspenseful psychological thriller. Aaron Matthews is a highly intelligent psychologist (and psycho) who can talk people into believing almost anything. The paths of Tate and Bett will soon cross with that of Matthews and we learn that something in Tate's past is the reason his daughter is missing.Filled with a few surprises and emotional situations, Deaver has written a satisfying story with some good characters. Matthews' use of language instead of tools (although tools are sometimes used) to knock his victims down, is a good change of pace. Overall, it's a good, quick entertaining read.Recommended"
4,Excellent book,This is a great book by one of the best writers in the business. Nobody crafts a story like Jeffery Deaver.
4,I liked it ALOT!,This is my first book by this author and I felt it was really good. It had a really good plot and the twist at the end was really interesting. I fully enjoyed this book. I would recomend it.
2,Boring and unbelievable,"This was my first audiobook by Deaver and it might be my last. While the overall premiss was all right the story just got to be too corny for my liking. give me a break every victim survives? Okay maybe one dies but the return of Megan's boyfrined was beyond fiction. The only character which i cared about in this whole production was Matthews himself and I'd wish he had killed Tate in the end. In my opinion it would have been just. Still, we have to have our predictable endings all tied up in a nice bow. No a complete bore and the RLV (repeat listening Value) of this audiobook is poor. Don't buy it but borrow it or rent it. Not a great thriller I'll stick to James Patterson from now on. Not recommended."
4,Another great thriller from Deaver.,"Jeffery Deaver is a master of adding twists and turns to the story and specially to the end of his thillers, just as in this book.Tate Collier and Aaron Mathews are both brilliant with words. One used to be an excellent trial lawyer, and the other is a brilliant psychologist. Mathews is out to get Collier and his family, and is determined to not let anything stop him. Colliers daughter, Megan, disappears and it looks as she ran away. Now Collier and his ex-wife, Bett McCall have to work together to try to stop him.A psychopath is gifted with a glib tongue can be as deadly as anything, and it doesn't make it any better when he's seeking violence and more important... he's looking for revenge!Maybe not Deaver's best book, but still worth to read if you love thrillers. To some this one might be a disappointment after reading other of his books."
3,Speaking in Tongues,"I agree with many of the reviews. This is not Deaver at his all time best. His Lincoln Rhymes books are well crafted. This is a fast read. I agree that all the characters are flat. The only character I thought was the least bit interesting was Josh and he was a very minor one. How in the world did he escape those dogs after being stabbed, slashed and bitten? What did he see in Megan? Did anyone care about Amy's murder. On the other hand, can we as readers expect every author to be brilliant in every novel?"
2,Disappointing Deaver,"After discovering Deaver's wonderful previous books, I really was shocked at the rather slipshod and ramshackle way he put together ""Speaking in Tongues"". Unrealistic is an understatement in the way the killer seems to show everywhere, easily misleading and eluding the police and getting them to convey confidential information. And the ending is so poorly done. This looks like a book he was writing to beat a deadline and so he just threw a bunch of ideas and words together. Again, very disappointing."
3,Enjoyable but doesn't compare to Lincoln Rhyme Novels,"I did enjoy the book, being a fan of Jeffrey Deaver, but this cannot compare to the excitment of his Lincoln Rhyme novels. There is a letdown involving a nice character at the beginning, and a very delightful twist at the end with a nice character. The ending is very sad, thinking of an innocent life wasted at the hands of abuse. Very tragic and heart breaking. But another character, Meagan, we get to watch develop and grow every time we turn a page. She is a real hero to herself. The ending had a small twist, not up to the caliber of other Deaver novels, but I still enjoyed reading this book. Deaver has a skill in portraying his characters that make even his lesser works quick and exciting and easy to bite into."
2,Below average story.,"This book has to be one of the most simplistic of Mr. Deaver's works. He is a top-tier suspense writer, however this book falls well short of his writing abilites, as have been evidenced by his other books. If you are thinking of starting your first Deaver novel, please check another one. The book's action is well described, when it occurs. The actions of the antagonist are beyond belief; they make all the ancillary characters look stupid, and All the characters can't be that stupid. Even the protagonists in this book are problematic; it is hard to make a connection with them, and I almost found myself rooting against them. If Dr. Matthews were a little more plausible, then I might have been pulling for him. As it turns out, Megan is the most sensible character in the book. I do not regret reading this book, however it is not a great one."
2,Not his best - and previously published in 1995,"As noted on the copyright page of this book, it was previously published in England in 1995. ""Gee, I wonder why it was not published here?"" I thought. Because it is not that good of a book is the answer. It was obviously released to take advantage of his success with ""Bone Collector"" and the Rhyme series. This is book is not about Rhyme nor is it nearly as good a read as the books in that series.There are no likeable characters in the book (some would say they are ""flawed people"" - but they are just not likeable). So you really don't care much about what happens to them - which in most ways is pretty predictable. There is a small twist in the last part of the book that is a little surprise, but that it about it. I found myself glad that this book was rather short."
2,Not the usual Deaver genius,"I liked the concept of using words as weapons, however, the very weak ""love"" story line was soooo boring that it had NO place in this book. There were tons of plot holes - seemingly incomplete! The ending also had a very unfinished feel to it. I don't feel like Deaver even liked it! Kind of thrown together. Had he worked on this a couple of more months, perhaps it would have been up to standard. What a HUGE disappointment! Take a little more time, Mr. Deaver, don't disappoint your audience so."
3,"A good, pulp novel","Deaver is an excellent author and his recent work is superb. ""Speaking in Tongues"" is one of his earlier works. As such, it shares many of his later trademarks (fast-paced, plot twists and bucks, full of suspense) but is also a little less mature. I found the characters a bit flat and the book hard to get into, though still enthralling -- so you keep flipping through the pages, waiting to see what happens, but not registering that much connection with the story.Overall, it's better than any recent Grisham book and still a good read, though I'd shelve it in favour of a Michael Connelly or one of Deaver's more recent works. It's worth a read if you really like his later work or want something to while away the time while travelling."
1,I Couldn't Even Finish This Book,"I usually like Jeff Deaver books, especially the Lincoln Rhyme series. I thought I'd try this one to see if I should read some of his non-Rhyme books. I perservered through 2/3 of the book, and then I realized that I was forcing myself to read any further. Luckily I didn't buy the book. I borrowed it, so I decided I'm not going to bother finishing something I'm not enjoying. After reading some of the previous reviews, maybe I should have persevered to see the twist at the end, but I just couldn't do it."
4,A Turning Point,"I've begun reading some of Deavers earlier works lately. I had already finished Praying for sleep and really wasn't that impressed. I did however, like Speaking in Tongues. Had alot of Deaver's signature style. I would say that this one is the turning point from his older stuff to the better newer stuff!"
4,An enjoyable read,"I became a curious Deaver fan after watching the movie bone collector and then wanted to try the novel. Well, I'm a bonified fan now and have since read all the Lincoln Ryhme series books (which are GREAT books!) Although this is not a Lincoln Ryhme series book, this story unfolds and captures the reader within the first 20 pages and continues throughout the end. As always, Deaver's writing style totally capitulates the reader into the story, enticing the reader throughout the book until the end. After finishing a Deaver novel, the reader is anxiously awaiting the author's next novel! A novel I enjoyed adding to my library."
3,Hardly on par with other Deaver books,"If you liked some of the other thrillers that Deaver has written, then you might like this one.For me personally. Deaver is one of my favorite authors, but this book just does not have the punch that his others had. I had high expectations for Tate Collier, but he turned out to be a paper-thin portrayal with no character.I actually found myself rooting for Dr. Aaron Matthews, the villain, especially after he makes some quite ingenious moves in order to destroy the lives of the main characters.Overall, although the characters are written thinly, and it lacks the typical Deaver-esque suspense, 'Speaking in Tongues' is an O.K. book. But just O.K."
1,Who wrote this?,"I am thoroughly disapointed in the money I wasted on this Dean Koontz slap it together knockoff. I can hardly believe that the same person who wrote Maidens Grave pened this story. I thought "" The Empty Chair "" was a fluke, but after reading this I am starting to wonder if ""Maidens Grave"" and the ""Bone Collector"" were the flukes. You would be bettor off spending your money on a new author Boris Starling. ""The Messiah"" is the first work I can find of his, and if its not bettor than the ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Seven"" its at least equal."
3,I felt cheated....,"Having been a Jeffery Deaver fan for several years now, I was looking forward to his ""new"" suspense novel. I thought, how prolific, he also released The Empty Chair this year. After reading the first two chapters I had an uneasy sense of dejavu. Aha! On the copyright page, in little tiny type it said the book was previously published in Great Britain in 1995! Now I remember reading it two years ago in London! I didn't think then that it was one of Mr. Deaver's better books and I don't think so now. The characters are shallow, the plotting plods along and the plot-twists are telegraphed. Mr. Deaver is a talented writer. His writing has matured in the past five years. It is a shame that he has to dilute his reputation by allowing his publisher to release this potboiler."
3,Didn't Do It For Me,"I had great expectations for this novel, as I've become a dedicated Deaver fan and will read anything he writes... this, however, was a let-down... it didn't reflect the skill he's developed over the years... I can't wait until Lincoln Rhyme returns for another exciting adventure!"
2,Not his best effort,"This is certainly Jeffery Wilds Deaver's worst book. I have read, and loved, all his previous novels, and had high expectations for this one. My expectations were not met. The plot barely existed. The plot, where it existed, was predictable. There were no surprises. I didn't like the characters. It was a fast read, and worth reading if you can check it out from your local library or wait for paperback."
3,An ok read...,"This is not up to the level of ""The Bone Collector"" or ""Devil's Teardrop"" or ""A Maiden's Grave"". It reads quick, and while not overly satisfying, it's a good check-out-from-the-library-kill-a-few-hours book."
3,Doesn't live up to author expectations,"Being a big fan of Jeffery Deaver, I was expecting more of the same: richly developed characters and insight into a realm of evil that only Deaver can create. This book lacked both of these. The killer in this book was not very well portrayed and I did not feel much for any of the characters. I hope Deaver is not making the Grisham mistake of writing the book for the movie instead of focusing on a good read. I was disappointed. A good plane read, but not one I'll recommend."
2,Written by whom??,"OK, I suffered through half of this book, so I claim the right to rate and review it! Having read at least 2 prior Jeffery Deaver novels (The Empty Chair and The Coffin Dancer), I expected that this new one would also be enjoyable. I was wrong. Sophomoric dialogue and run-of-the-mill story do not an enjoyable novel make! Makes me wonder who really wrote this book. Do not bother with this one."
2,"Geez, disappointing","I was excited to get this CD. I have all the Smiths CD's as well as 4 or 5 solo Morrissey stuff. I must say that this is very BLAND! Of course you get 'Everyday is like Sunday' and 'Suedehead'....but that is about it. The music on this album is TERRIBLE!! How could this happen? I really dug the mock rockablilly stuff with Boz Boorer and Whyte...but this!? Isn't this the most sterile sound you have ever heard? I mean...the guitar parts are laughable to say the least. Please skip this one readers! I have yet to own Bona Drag, Kill Uncle, and Malajusted. Please email me if any of the following sound anything like 'VIVA HATE' I'll be GREATLY appreciative!Thanks! sjwieczorkow@hotmail.com"
5,Intelligent lyrics and pop music,"Morrissey's style (both in and outsithe The Smiths),is so compelling and influencial, that its echoes can be appreciated in a wide variety of artists; for the mainstream-ish Cranberries, to Cat Power, to Tori Amos, to Elliot Smith, to Radiohead. ""Viva Hate"" is the beginning of Morrissey's interesting yet a little uneven solo career. Songs like the dark ""Little Man What Know?"", the Smith-ish ""Suedehead"", the sweetly violent ""Margaret in the Guillotine"", among many others, make this record deliciously compelling. Though echoes of his former group still sound here, as said before, Morrissey tries new ways to write without seeming too experimental. However, he keeps showing himself as a highly emotional and brutally honest songwritter."
3,A brave new world,"The shaky debut of Morrissey solo. Many a Smiths fan held their breath upon the first track's listening. Seems to evoke a love/hate opinion among the loyalists. At times Morrissey seems to be a kid in candy store flush with his oportunity to answer to no one. Thus the album tends to get a bit heavy. Contains the famous ""Everyday Is Like Sunday' which triggered many a cover of the poignant song. All in all; a so so debut, but hey he is just testing the waters."
4,"Very good, but should have been better","This album played by The Smiths lineup, might have surpassed The Queen is Dead or Meat is Murder.As it stands it is very good. Probably the most Smiths like of his solo albums which isn't surprising given it was released soon after the regrettable demise of The Smiths. The main difference is that Johnny Marr is irreplaceable, though Stephen Street is competent and compliments Morrissey well.My favorites on this album are Angel, Angel..., which might be the most haunting and beautiful song he ever penned. Every day is like Sunday, Suedehead, Hairdresser on Fire and Alsatian Cousin. The rest are just so-so, but not bad.If you are new to The Smiths or Morrisey, check out The Smiths, as his work with Johnny Marr and co is unbeatable, and then start with this and go through his solo catalog."
5,everyone click that my review helped you!,"Everyone click that they thought this review helped them. The album was fabulous, too."
4,VIVA HATE : a good place to start,"Morrissey's career thus far has been full of incredible highs and some rather confusing lows, but overall, he's proven himself to be a songwriter and lyricist of unique talent and an undefineable charm. this was his first album after The Smiths disbanded and it shows him in fine form. classic songs such as ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"", ""Hairdresser On Fire"" and the quintessential ""Suedehead"" are all career-defining moments and snapshots of genuine pop genius. elsewhere on the album, things get a little darker and moodier with the orchestral snippet of ""Angel, Angel, Down We Go Together"", the haunting ambience of ""Late Night, Maudlin Street,"" and the scathing ""Alsatian Cousin."" Viva Hate may not be the most solid solo record from Morrissey, but it's a fine album and a bright start of more great things to come."
1,Not the 1981 Movie - This is a 4-Movie Collection,"This DVD unfortunately is not the 1981 movie starring Erin Moran, Edward Albert, Ray Walston, Robert Englund, etc. but rather is actually a collection of 4 really wretched sci-fi movies that make the real Galaxy of Terror look like LOTR in sci-fi form. Only title I even remember was Blood Red Planet and the 3 other movies are so bad that my mind has already wiped them from my poor psyche before I was scarred for life. If you are looking for good cheesy sci-fi, this collection is not for you. If you are looking for bad cheesy sci-fi, this collection is still not for you. If you are looking to throw away money, go donate to a local charity instead of regretting the loss of your money on this thing."
1,NOT the one your wishing for!!!,"This sorry collection of lame movies gathered together is just another reason not to pre-order a movie,based on just the title.One out of four movies is still, in my book, just not the right reason, to sell this crap collection.From now on,I'm not buying anything without a complete review!! I really would rate this collection with a MINUS 3!!!"
1,Not a Terror at All,"Luckily I had the good sense to rent this movie first. I wasn't even worth the rental price from Netflix. I don't even think I watched more than the first move. I started the other 3, but they seemed to be even worse then the first was. Don't just stay from this sorry collection. Run away as fast as possible."
3,in response to the wise sage,"yeah, right, and since all there is to being black is anger and sarcasm then we should all outgrow it right? is anybody with me here? huh? nikki giovanni is a voice beyond race. it's quite grotesque to put her in a box when that's just what she's hoping won't happen. by the by, kahlil gibran isn't just an 'adolescent' author. just because he's straight forward and writes in a classical style doesn't make him shallow. wait a few more years when your disillusionment has given way to a need for sincerity and reapproach these authors. if you still don't like it then so be it but don't blame it 'adolescense' or some other cop out nonsense. adults have been reading and praising these authors for years. smile."
3,Loved it when I was a teenager,"I would put this book in a category with Kahlil Gibran, it's the sort of thing that you really love when you are about 16 and later you're less enthusiastic (it's really a rare book, and usually a really good one, that survives puberty in your own estimation). But then, since I am not black and have never experienced the things that many blacks have, there may be some stuff here about racism and anger that just never spoke to me. I mean, I used to be a lot more angry in general than I am now and so the anger aspect of the book is less sympathetic to me these days."
3,Too soft and lesstylish --**something is missing,"I dont know what happen but the others Beach House cd's having more style,more shining, only 2 o 3 song are really goodCd2-Monny with ""This is your life"" , very very good song-Dj Chus Ft Concha Buika : Please concha have a grant voice , what happen with this one, she is strong and divine but in this song sound like a anyone singer-Peyton sound good but......-Flower Power : Nice rhythm but......Cd1 Miguel Migs save the cd1 , Mood II swing ¡¡¡?????"
3,Rudimentary -- OK for asp.net beginners,"I think the two one-star reviews are unnecessarily harsh. This is not a great book, to be sure, but it is adequate to introduce the topic to interested beginners.The book is rudimentary, but that is what I needed. I came to MS VWD knowing enough HTML to tweak pages that I put together in a web editor like NAMO or FrontPage. I knew nothing about developing interactive web pages, which is something I need to know, and this book is helping me break the ice.The full text of this book is available free as an e-Book from Microsoft after you download VWD 2005 Express and register it. The on-line version even has a couple of extra chapters not in the printed version. Since VWD 2005 Express is also free, you can in a sense get this book for nothing if you are willing to do without hard copy."
1,Stay away from this book,"I bought this book to learn more about VB.net and web programming with most focus on the web part. This book is a mess. The examples are empty and does not show you how to do things. Complicated features are described with: ""You can try this if you want to"" type of examples. But the book does not tell you how. Many of of the things the book suggests does now work because the book and Visual Studio 2005 use different terminology several places. There are no way you can learn Visual studio 2005 and web development through this book."
1,How NOT to write a beginners book,"This book is a disgrace. It is a mish mash of information which is all probably ONLY useful to those who have experience in creating websites using this tool. As a beginner to Visual Studio this is an absolute disappointment. Despite the fact it purports to take you through the entire process it does NONE of this, merely giving you the completed site and letting you work it out on your own. In the front of the book I read that the execises would lead you through the process..WHAT A JOKE!Dont buy this book, unless its a going away present for someone you have fired or your ex!"
2,Incorrect Epson Number for Product,"While the title for this product is technically correct (it is Epson 36x100 Semigloss Photo Paper), when I received the paper it is actually the Epson S041642, which is the heavier 250g paper rather than the 170g. It's still not a bad price for the product, but it is listed incorrectly."
4,Fake accent........you've got to be kidding!,"The more I hear Missy Higgins, the more I like her. Her music is original; the lyrics are deep-felt and original; and she appears genuine. Laptop Junkie - you wouldn't know a genuine Australian accent if you fell over it. Missy sings with a genuine Aussie accent, unlike many others who put on a fake American accent to please the masses."
4,Honest. Peaceful. Beautiful,"These are the words I choose to describe Missy Higgins. Her album 'The Sound Of White' breathes in a strong originality and exhales simple yet extremely effective, non threating melodies. And deep-felt lyrics that resinate with you long after you leave the comfort of you lounge, or car.At only '21' missy has a unique, mature and at times heart wrenching voice, (especially in songs Nightminds, All For Believing, and Any Day Now) that is as refreshing as her 'girl next door' persona.Sure she isn't everyone's cup of tea. And she's not trying to be. Her work seems to say...'Hey, hear I am, this is it!'. Simple. Whether you connect with her music is your 'good, or bad luck'."
1,What's with the fake accent,I agree with Little Miss Cutie. This 'singer' has the weirdest accent considering she is meant to be Australian. What does she need to fake an Irish? Scottish? Welsh? accent for. She might actually have a semi decent voice if not for this stupid thing she's doing. Why not be who you are? Sing properly and you might be a bigger act.
1,Sheer Dissapointment...,"Just when the Australian music scene was starting to pick up, and I started to believe there was a true industry down under..I popped this disc into the player. 'The Sounds Of White' by award winner Missy Higgins, is quite possibly the worst collection of music I have heard in years. Just to make sure I wasnt the only one who had this oppinion, and I had no musicial taste whatsoever, I invited 8 friends over to listen.. The highest rating given was two out of five.. 40%! (which would be a failing mark in a music school exam) To say this album is 'not worth buying' would be an understatement. You'd have to pay me to keep it!"
1,Horrible voice,"Doesn't matter what kind of accent it is, that voice is just dreadful. She is like the female Bob Dylan. Can I put a negative star on this?"
1,Confused :-(,"I think both I and Missy Higgins are confused. I'm confused as to why if she is Australian, does she sing with a Scottish/Irish accent, and she's confused as to where she comes from if she sings with a Scottish/Irish accent. The music is to folksy and weird for me, but this accent thing is the main reason I can't stand her."
5,Near Perfect Album...,"Missy Higgins is one of those exceptional song writers that can create rich intelligent lyrics that still completely resonate with the listener. Listening to songs like ""Unbroken"", ""The Sound of White"", ""The Special Two"" and ""They Weren't There""(bonus song) are like reading someone else's diary and then realizing that it could be your own. Missy also has an ear for fitting the lyrics to appropriate music. The music isn't mind blowing, but it enhances the lyrics so well- that put together it all creates something extraordinary. My one complaint is that I frequently skip about three songs that I find both boring and uninteresting. However, this is still a wonderful debut by a very talented artist, musician and writer."
5,My new favorite Aussie singer: Missy Higgins,"This is my second CD in my collection of music by Missy Higgins. What a style this girl has. I love the voice, the vocal range, the hardness of some songs, the reality of others, and the soft vocals in others. I don't think there's a song on this CD that I don't like. Whatever else Missy has out there, I'm buying it b/c even though my ""older"" generation liked CCR, Three Dog Night, Pink Floyd, I'm into this girls style and sound of music. When I start my car, the CD player comes on and Missy is right there with me. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes that Aussie sound with a bit of snap to it in certain parts. This girl can really put it out without overpowering what the song was really meant to do. Get yours today!"
4,smooth and emotion driven,"My friends in Australia shipped this CD to me so I could hear for myself what the hype in Australia was all about.The album is very playable and I love the mellow melodic sound of Higgins voice on tracks like Scar, The River and The Special Two. Another reviewer bad mouthed this album because they said they couldn't dance to this music. Well they are right, this isn't dance music. This is well crafted and beautifully sung music. Higgins voice has a unique earthy quality to it that is a welcome change to the over produced pop drivel being pushed down our throats by the music labels this year."
4,More than most,"Missy Higgins has been playing at cafes in Melbourne for some time now. She was discovered by Triple J's ""Unearthed"" competition. What an unearthing it was. She's got a talent that is missing from many acts today. Her music has warmth, honesty and creativity which endears the album to the soul.I sometimes buy an album on a whim and am more often than not, only finding a couple of songs I like. I bought this one on a whim knowing ""Ten Days"", ""All For Believing"" and of course, ""Scar"" from the radio. I fell in love with the earthy feel that delights all the way through the album. If you have a whim to buy an album - I would full recommend this one!"
5,Stunning Music,"This album is truly amazing, her talent far exceeds any 21 year old musician I have ever heard. I got the honor of seeing her Live in concert with Howie Day, and knew that night I would buy her album. She has a great personality to go along with her amazing talent."
1,Bubbles in Glass,I sent the first one back because it had bubbles in the glass. The second one had worse bubbles. I got a refund.
5,One of the best...,"...scenes EVER is when Stanley has one of his ""moments"". I simply love all the wordplay in this book and the intricate (and not so intricate) character connections. Another Terry Pratchett winner!"
3,Funny but not great,Terry Pratchett is a great author who seems to have endless ideas for stories. This one is good but gets seriously bogged down in the clacks plot. We only needed to know a little bit about the Smoking Gnu. Too much time is spent on them and the signaling towers etc. Overall a good book Would give it 3.5 if I could.
4,"4 out of 5, better packing would have had 5 stars","Received package within time stated, but soft mailer package didn't provide enough padding to keep enclosed box corners from being crushed in."
4,Kindle formatting a little off,"There are spaces missing behind italicized words, which makes reading a bit jarring. Also, Pratchett seems to have italicized a lot more words than usual, making it a very noticeable problem."
5,Going Brilliant!,"First off this book is incredible and very much in the ""City Watch"" reahlm of Terry Prachett's Discworld. Regular Discworld readers will know what I mean.The sense of irony and the parallel between today's phyiscal mail systems and the internet debacles are crystal clear.You have it all embezzlement, murder, blackmail and the birth of stamp collecting.Terry Pratchett is that rarest of authors, the one who gets better and better with each outing."
4,Lots of fun to read!,"I decided to pick up a Terry Pratchett book after hearing an excerpt read on the Grammar Girl Podcast as part of Audible.com's plug. I ended up with this one as an almost random pick.This was one of the most enjoyable comic novels I have read in a long time. Pratchett's dialogue is laugh out loud funny at times--I had to call up some friends to read excerpts to them. I especially appreciated his razor sharp wit and the alternate world he has created.I didn't give this five stars because I was slightly disappointed with how everything wrapped up at the end. While this is true of most comic novels, I will say that this novel has a more coherent and cohesive story than the vast majority in the genre.This book is one that will rekindle your enjoyment of reading."
4,Not one of Pratchett's best but still funny,"I miss the guards in the novel, they are so well writen and a pleasure to read about. Even having the Patrician in the story (what a guy) doesn't make up for their lack of inclusion. But that said, this is an enjoyable read, especially for fans of the novels. Pratchett's cleverness is a joy to follow in the novels of Discworld; how can he make you laugh and be so cunning at the same time? Some of the action is a little far fetched, stretching what passes for reality on a world of magic a little tight. but it is still a pleasure to read. I hope he keeps writing them for years to come, if he does I will find it impossible to resist buying them."
4,Very good but not Great,"This is a good story and it held my interest but this one is not quite as good as the authors other stories of Discworld that I have read. I really enjoy Discworld and the characters that populate this place and time. The closed post office and the clackers were a facinating contrast and to punish the ""hero"" by putting him in charge of the post office was a stroke of genius."
5,Strong themes,"For me, Pratchett has nearly single-handedly steered genre fiction into deeper and theme-ier waters. I love his guards and witches and Nac Mac Feegle, but the last couple of books to come out of his head, Monstrous Regiment and Going Postal have forced me to construct a dais on top of the old one for his new throne."
4,Quailty Textbook,An in-depth textual history of the pentacostal movement of the 20th century. Intresting with lots of detail and yet not boring. Well documented.
2,Grupo Batuque - Samba De Futebol,"Those Brazilians really love their football -- just listen to the announcers screaming in the interludes of Grupo Batuque's album SAMBA DE FUTEBOL. While the tracks themselves are worthwhile, they are, oddly, not as compelling as the insane football babble. A few standouts here and there: the pleasant female vocals and mid-song tempo increase of ""E Ruim"" or the melodic chorus on ""Soberana."" Many of these tracks don't show the technical polish that would be apparent on their later albums. While this gives them an aggressive, raw feel, it also makes them sound like field recordings (the not-quite on pitch vocals of ""Ole Ola,"" for example). Many of the tracks lack development, which makes you think of a street party that you'd wish would end so you can get some sleep. The actual field recording interludes don't help, either. The album doesn't quite reach its goal."
5,Love this company and their C,"I take two a day and more if i'm traveling, haven't been sick for a long time and I used to be chronically ill <3"
3,The tapes don't deliver what's promised.,"I very much like Sylvia's outlook and manner. She is earthy and pragmatic. But her tapes do not discuss ""making contact with the other side."" They are a taped lecture, and while I truly like her, there were no suggestions for ""making contact"" with the other side. While entertaining and worth listening to, don't bother if you wish to learn how to learn to utilize the psychic abiltiy she says is inherent in all of us."
3,Enjoyable,"This is a very enjoyable tape--I laughed out loud several times at her no-nonsense views on living life on this planet. Good to listen to on your way to work. However, I tend to agree with one of the other reviewers that the title of the audiotape did not fit the description of the content. I specifically bought the tape to learn more about developing psychic ability and I did not feel my expectation was met in that regard, nor did I feel Sylvia intended to meet that expectation."
2,Misleading Title,"This tape is an interesting lecture about Browne's work as a medium. But she offers no aid to those interested in ""contacting the other side."" The title is very misleading."
1,WHAAAAAAAT??????,"I am confused! What was Sylvia trying to say? Because, she surely was NOT trying to help anyone get in touch with the other side. Perhaps Sylvia really DOESN'T know how to do this. Hey Sylvia, light a candle, dear. If anyone really wants guidance on this subject, find it somewhere else. Try Robert Monroe or Jane Roberts."
1,Title and advertising is totally misleading,The title and advertising is totally misleading. I do like the book because it is entertaining but was disappointed that it did not address contacting the other side or enhancing your pyschic abilities.
1,Save up for something more expensive and better made,"We bought this toaster oven from Bed, Bath and Beyond for about $26. It lasted about three months before the top elements - essential for broiling - failed. As others have reported, it takes an age to heat up and is a complete time-waster for toasting. But what can expect for a few bucks?The limited warranty that comes with the item only covers returns to the manufacturer, with shipping both ways being met by the customer. (Amazon may have a different policy.) As this amounts to more than the cost of the toaster oven (the cost of shipping and handling back to the customer is itself $18.95), I'd guess the manufacturer is not expecting many returns.So save your money and look for something more expensive and better made.[Later] In fairness to Bed, Bath and Beyond, I should mention that they took back the toaster oven and refunded my money with very good grace."
2,Failure as a Toaster,"I bought this to replace a very inexpensive Toastmaster that I thought didn't look nice on the counter. Well, this one looks nice but it is very inefficient for toast. It takes a long time to heat up and the toasting is very hit or miss. It is either not enough or burnt so we end up watching the toaster. For small baking/broiling jobs it is ok but we bought it primarily as a toaster."
1,Don't waste your money on this toaster oven.,"First, I put bread in this toaster for toast. Then I cook bacon and eggs...the toast still isn't toasted. When it finally gets hot, it starts to smoke up the kitchen.I am only sorry I threw the box away, otherwise, I would return it.Choose another toaster."
1,Not So Impressed,"We liked the fact that you can leave the door propped open during broiling, but I have yet to have anything toast or bake ""just right"". I burned 3 frozen waffles before finding the right ""toast"" setting. I have an 8x8 Pyrex dish that fits in it, but have yet to find any baking sheets. I wouldn't give this to anyone as a gift."
3,Stopped working - less than one year old,"It worked wonderrfuly until a few days ago when it died. Plugged in, the only working part is the timer. We have had this toaster oven less than one year. BUY AN Extended warranty if you want this item!"
5,Great Book,Fascinating book about a sociopath and what they are capable of. Surfers would love the book because it gives detailed descriptions of the surfing experience
3,Out With a Smaller Boom than Expected,"I really have been loving this series, but the conclusion didn't live up to all I had hoped for. Apparently Stephen didn't bother to read the previous books written by his cohorts, and decided to skew the meticulusly created characters. Toturi's character was nice but not delved into enough. The other character's profiles seemed totally off from how they appeared in the other books - not only that but some events even seemed to occur differently!! The final battle seemed to drag on for ages, with people going to their ""last"" ounce of strength over and over and over again. While it was still a good book, it definitly was not the sort of conclusion the series deserved. I am very suprised the man who crafted The Scorpion wrote something this starkly different."
5,simply phenomenal,"checking my cat 6 cable runs has never been easier. Wiring my home network by myself has never been easier, no more second guessing"
1,TOO CHEAP to last even first use,"I tried using this for the first time, and the led lights worked for 5 secs and that's it. Only the on-off led works now, and all the sequencing LEDs are not working. Not worth returning either. Sigh..."
2,You get what you pay for,All I can say is you get what you pay for. This is very cheaply built. I think I paid less than $10 for it so I can't be mad.
2,Cheap,This is the cheap made tester I've ever seen. The On/Off switch broke the second time I turned it on. Go with something else.
3,"Sets new low bar for cheap, flimsy, yet working","To call this item cheaply made is to insult cheaply made products. Comes without a battery of course, so I pressed my thumb on the battery cover to slide it off and the battery cover shattered into three pieces. The on-off switch slides very hard, it is binding against something. But it does test a cable. I don't know how long it will last, but I only need to test a couple of cables and then I can untape the battery (it costs more than the tester) and dump this device in the trash. For $3.25 I expected ... well, I expected to test a few cables. So I'm satisfied.Oh yeah, please remember, according to the instructions: ""Test cannot be done while RJ45's copper screezers are not totally pressed."" For the sake of your children, don't forget to press the screezers!"
1,Broke within 14 days.,"Within 14 days, the tester's 6 connection wasn't validating any wire. Tested on my own creations, as well as retail cat5e cables. Product was not in American English, labels were not secured to the device. Would not buy again."
2,Very cheaply made,This is simply a large piece of plastic. It works but I've only tried it out once. This is very cheap and seems like if you drop it once then it'll end up in pieces. Its so cheap that they didn't even bother to put a piece of foam to cushion the battery...
3,Network Cable Tester,It was good tester to test RJ45 Ethernet cable for network connection. Test result was satisfied for $3.99 price tester. You can't find very good tester for cheaper and delivery from HongKong to CA within two weeks.
1,Seller did not produce product ordered,Network Cable Tester - Seller did not produce product ordered and has not/will not respond to any communications sent to them. I DO NOT RECOMMEND nor TRUST THIS SELLER.
2,You get what you pay for,"After getting past the awful smell upon opening the package (I feel very sorry for the people in China having to assemble these things) I took the tester out of it's little zippered case. I attempted to open the battery compartment and the cover immediately shattered into a half-dozen pieces, cutting my thumb a bit. That was pretty disappointing. It takes a 9V transistor radio battery (not supplied...didn't expect it to be for the price). After connecting a battery and duct taping it in place I tried testing a couple of CAT 5e and CAT 6 cables as well as a network connection. It seemed to work. So for now-and-then non-critical use I guess it'll do. If I were to do it again I'd buy something a little more substantial though. Shipping cost more than the device and I can see why. Buyer beware."
1,BELIEVE THE HYPE,Don't ignore these reviews. This product is a piece of crap and broke on me in the first 30 seconds it was out of the package. You're better off purchasing a better product that costs more because this is literally a waste of money.
1,Another junk product sold on Amazon,I have professional-grade testing equipment and when I saw this one for $6 I needed to try it to believe it. Of course it's a piece of crap. I tested one cable and one led wasn't turning on and I thought the problem was with my cable - when actually it was with the tester!Of course this piece of junk will cost more to return than just throw away in the garbage. Typical made in China garbage sold with manuals that are so badly written that it is even comical to read. Worst of all is seeing Amazon backing up and agreeing to sell this type of crap... Unbelievable and sad.
2,False Positives,"After spending the time to cut, crimp, and test my own LAN cable, I received a working status from the cable and proceeded to run the cable and hook it up. After doing so, it failed to work, so after a while I actually tested the cable with my laptop directly from the wall without success... The stupid thing gave me a false positive! Turns out I had one of the wires reversed (with pins 1-8 on one end and then 8-1 on the other) and the tester said it was all good.Spend some additional money and buy something better like this:Pyle Home PHCT45 Network Cable Tester"
2,Get What You Pay For,"I knew the price was ""too good to be true"". On/off switch is quite hard to move and I'm sure it would fail if used frequently. Fortunately, the ""1 connector"" channel was not getting power from the tester and so it did not work right out of the box. Returned the unit to Amazon (Thank you for a rational return policy--unlike some big box competitors.)"
5,It DOES what it is supposed to do!,"This device did its job satisfactorily. There was no instruction manual included, however it was intuitive how to use it.I was tired of getting weak wireless signal, so decided to hard-wire the house. It identified a wire pair that was misaligned in the terminal, through the odd blinking sequence. I have made numerous patch cables before and tested them with a multimeter, with alot of difficulty. However, when one end of the cable is in the kitchen and the other in the living room, no multimeter will reach that far. It was worth the price. It works on phone patch wires too, however the master sequence is opposit the remote."
4,Network tester,For the price it works good for occasional network cable testing. Tested it out on RJ45 cables and worked good.
3,Network cable tester,Number six light don't work only seven lights work other then that it would have been a nice.5 star cable tester
1,Complete garbage,"The tester arrived with two of the conductor tests not working. I opened up the tester and was able to correct one of them by re-soldering a faulty joint. The poor quality was very evident in the case, the printed circuit board, and the soldered joints. I could not diagnose the other faulty conductor test visually. Because it was of such obviously poor quality I decided to trash it rather than waste more of my time trying to fix it. This item is further proof that you get what you pay for.Also, the instructions were written in poor English."
4,It is what it is,"I did not expect a top of the line unit for the price that I paid, however I am very pleased with the unit. I have used to trace both phone lines and Ethernet cables with good results. Highly recommended."
1,Low price gamble,Arrived dead. Tried everything to get it to work. Finally took it apart and found a couple of unsoldered connections. It was a gamble due to the low price. I have just as good luck when I go to Vegas. I played the roulette wheel and lost.
1,Junk,"As if all the other reviews weren't enough, this thing is garbage. Put the battery in, it indicated power, but none of the status lights came up, and that was on a cable I knew to be functional.Save yourself a couple bucks, and a waste of time and don't buy this."
3,Needs english instructions.,"The product works as advertised, but the brief instructions are a very poor translation to english, and are virtually unintelligible. I basically had to figure it out without instructions. Fortunately it was not very complicated."
1,DOA,"I knew it would be cheap when I ordered it, but didn't expect it to be THIS cheap. I got it, put a battery in, turned it on, nothing. Connected up a good working cable, nothing. LED for Pin 1 came on and nothing else; completely DOA. Waste of time and money."
4,Simple and effective connectivity tester,"The tester has two components, a master unit for one end of the cable and a slave for the remote end. Because they are detachable you can check cables when you can't see both ends at the same time.This instrument tests for connectivity i.e. it will tell you if all the wires are in the right place and whether thay are open ot not. I didn't check to see if it detected shorts.It will not tell you if you have the twisted pairs mixed up - this could show up as a high packet error rate.The instructions were not in English but it is pretty obvious how to use it. You insert the one end of the cable into the master and the other end into slave and switch on.Don't expect too much from the quality of the material used in it's construction. It's not going to stand up to any abuse and probably won't last very long That said it's quite a bargain and I happily recommend it."
1,Does not work,"The product arrived in one piece. It worked for 2 days. Oh, the joy. Praise the lord.It then stopped working. Do not buy, unless you have a weird sense of humor."
1,DOA - Dead on arrival,"Well, maybe not dead, but it does not work. One light blinks and that is all. I tested it with several cables and always got the same one blinking light. (it is supposed to blink all the lights as it checks the wire)So I had to check my cables the old way - Simply plug them in and do a upload/download test.I guess I will resend this, and maybe then I can review this more pleasantly.But for now, my recommend is to stay away from this product."
4,"It works, but it feels so low quality.","For around only 5 bucks, it's to be expected that it feels and looks cheap and it sure is. On the bright side it works perfectly for checking bad cables or testing out new made cables.Now time will tell how long it'll last."
5,cat5 cable tester,"a must have for making cat5 cable easy to use right out of the box buys note ""it needs a 9v battery"" thanks"
3,Definitely not great,It works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't so I would not recommend anyone to purchase this item. I was disappointed.
3,"Good for the price, but...","I've had a few of these testers. Yes, they get the job done and are easy to use....BUT!On both of the testers I've had a ""pin"" will stop working after only a few months. So pretty much every cable on my newest tester shows that pin #5 is out.Still pretty much usable, I just have to take it on faith that pin #5 is working. If they put a little bit more quality into the building of this thing it would be perfect!"
3,Gets the job done,"Saw this was cheap so I'd give it a try. It tests cables and works though I have not used it to test regular phone cables only ethernet. I rated it 3 stars because it feels so cheap and probably break if I drop it. The battery compartment lid/door seems like it will break if I attempt to open it to change the battery so am keeping it in there for now, a little tape will fix it when the time comes. Not to be too picky but the green label's holes where the light blinks didn't match perfectly but that's not really a problem. Its cheap, it works, it hasn't broken on me...yet."
3,Tester,"It's cheap but get the job done. There is a sharp edge on the master unit where remote unit slide slides on, sharp enough to cut yourself. Recommend dulling it by scrape it with a knife. Works great."
5,Musk talc,My favorite perfumed talc - hard to find. I have always loved this since the first time I received it as a gift.
4,I love this stuff!,"I love Alyssa Ashley and have a very hard time finding it, so I was thrilled to see it here! The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because when I went to open the top of the container, the bottom actually fell out and spilled the powder all over. I am in Minnesota and the container was cold, so that might have contributed to it falling apart..."
5,Nice,"I bought this for a gay friend of mine, and he absolutely loved it. I stopped to read it with him, and I thought it was pretty insightful. Some of the stuff, I agree, is a little common sense, but it's presented quite well. It features some homosexual art and illistrations, and the way it speaks sounds caring and it's just lovely, I think. People expect the Kama Sutra to be sexually explict material full of positions and stuff, but it's supposed to teach how to make love, not just sex. This book does a good job of it."
2,Not what I expected.,"I got this book hoping to spark my boyfriend's and my imagination. However, this book offers no advice. It tells you basically everything you alredy know or will know as soon as you've been out for a year or two. The positions that they display could be imagined by any 14 year-old boy with a hormone surge. The advice on relationships and how to maintain them is good, but any guy with enough common sense to effectly and successfuly solve his relationship problems without the aid of Jerry Springer will not benefit from this book."
1,Huh?,"Why does any gay man need a book about what it's like to be a gay man? Most of the information in the book is useless; there, I imagine, only to fulfill the authors commitment to his publishers. Don't waste your time or money."
4,Worthwhile addition to your Canon camcorder kit,"If you're using a Canon Elura 100 or other compatible camcorder, this auxillary lens is a gem. This small, compact and light adapter increases your maxiumum focal length by 70%, which makes it ideal for anyone shooting out of doors.For out-of-doors scenics, sports photography and a host of other uses, it's the cat's meow.It's pretty sharp and I experienced no vignetting anywhere along the range. Even though it's kind of on the pricey side, I think it's a very worthwhile addition to the videographer's kit.Jerry"
3,Helpful Hazards Studies Reference,"I read this in one weekend for discussion in a graduate natural hazards seminar, lots of stimulating information-- a worthy, and friendly read for the professor and the student."
5,"Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design and Space Planning, 2nd Edition","This book is a must for all in Interior Design.[[ASIN:0071346163 Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design and Space Planning, 2nd Edition]It is very informative and best guide ever"
2,Not worth buying!,I have had this book for the passed 7 years and have glanced inside maybe 4 times! The best book to buy as a reference is the Interior Graphic Standards!
3,Can't Not Have This,"This is a required book for anyone in Interior Design for a good reason: it has about everything, including the (many kinds) of kitchen sink. What I really can't stand about using it is the seemingly arbitrary indexing, scattered locations for information and nearly impossible to decipher graphics on some pages. I do not agree that it has much useful information on furniture styles: you'd be better off to shell out for Aronson's ""Encyclopedia of Furniture"" or Miller's ""Furniture"" and get right to what you need. The standard dimensions are useful, though, especially for space planning purposes. Don't be surprised if there is information missing in some cases, or it is outright incorrect. Be sure to cross-reference and here's another tip: make a cheat sheet for yourself for the pages you use most, tape it to the inside cover and go from there. The Index is a goose-chase. Why three stars? Because I think they can do better. It is time for a rehaul of the Silver Monster."
2,How good is your eyesight?,"This is a tome of a book, and its contents are initially very impressive, but it STILL contains many old and out of date details which have been pulled and photocopied from projects that are rather worn and ragged looking. Also, many of the drawings are not legible due to size and lineweight quality, and so you may have to resort to pulling out a magnifying glass to decipher the information.In my opinion, a superior resource is ""Interior Graphic Standards"" by Kelsey Kruse and Maryrose McGowan. Or, at least, one should have both books but check the information in this one against the far more accurate volume by Kruse/McGowan."
3,No Shoulder Straps!!!,"Recently bought this bag, so no idea what the durability is like. Please note this bag has no shoulder straps!! The product fact does mention this. Size is decent enough to use for school."
4,Enjoyable escapism.,"For me romance novels have a few standards of measure. I enjoy it when the heroine does not have to compromise who she is to get the man in the end, in this book, Sophie, a journalist for a popular magazine (think like People) remains herself until the end.The hero needs a little more than tall dark and handsome. Fabien--has only a little more, he is french, titled and tortured. So we get the added random French catch phrases, the brooding looks and scars from a past accident.The past is key for this as Sophie is trying to figure out a pivotal moment in Fabien's past. Westwood does a good job of pulling the past into the present narrative. What she also does exceedingly well is introducing and maintaining constant tension between the two characters. There are also a nice array of supporting characters (mostly cultivated from Fabien's side of the story, and a few aren't entirely explained as well as I would have liked it). This also has a nice PG-13 rating."
5,Foot Bath,"This was an amazing item. It was for my 81 year old mother, who needed the massaging foot action for circulation and nerve problems. She loves it."
5,on mystic lake,wow what a great read so true to life and a very touching story i really enjoyed this novel couldnt put it down
4,BOOK MARKS,"APRIL 30, 2010TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY, I RECEIVED THE BOOK, YESTERDAY, NOT VERY SUPRISED, ONLY BECAUSE WHEN EVER I ORDER FROM YOUR COMPHANY, I USUALLY RECEIVE THE MERCHANDISE, BEFORE THE WEEK IS OVER. THANK YOU. THE ONE ITEM I'M SUPRISED I DON'T GET IS THE BOOK MARKS I USED TO GET YEARS AGO, THEY WERE JUST ORDINARY BOOK MARKS, BUT KIND OF A NICE TOUCH, THAT CAME WITH THE BOOKS I ORDERED.WE DON'T GET THEM ANYMORE,I GUESS IT'S JUST BUSINESS AS USUAL, BUT THEY WERE A NICE THING TO SEND WITH A BOOK, MAYBE SOMEONE WILL LISTEN, TO THIS REVIEW, I HOPE SO....."
2,offensive language,"I read tons of books so my granddaughters are always asking me to recommend books for them to read. I choose the books I buy from reading the information on the covers and also from the reviews. I thought I had found another author with good books to read. I am always extremely disappointed as I get into the book to find foul, vulgar, and irreverent language that completely ruins what could be a decent and entertaining story. I bought some of Kristen Hannah's books and was looking forward to curling up for a good time reading. I do not understand why writers think they have to spice up their books with offensive language. It destroys the story for me. I'm sorry but her books are now in the trash pile and I will not recommend them to anyone."
5,What a Story!,"Kristin Hannah has done it again. She is a master of taking the reader to beautiful places with interesting and often complex characters. Annie returns home to Mystic Lake after her husband of 20 years tells her that he wants a divorce because he's in love with another woman. Annie is a nurturer and is always there to take care of others, but in the meantime she has lost herself. During her stay in Mystic Lake she comes to know true love, finds out about herself, and helps a little girl who has lost her mommy understand that ""it's going to be okay."" The little girl, Izzy, will capture your heart and make you laugh and cry. Hannah keeps you waiting until the bitter end...the last few pages...to see how things tie up and if the ending will be happy. This book will not disappoint you."
5,Becomes apart of your heart,"It is easy sometimes for readers to forget what a good book really is. It is easy sometimes for us to accept the complacency and mediocracy that pours from the publishing world in a torrent of so-called ""bestsellers"" and ""best yets"" -- until a true voice with a marvelous story to tell sneaks in while nobody is looking. Kristin Hannah is just that voice; ""On Mystic Lake"" is just that story.It isn't an easy book to read. It deals with divorce, alcoholism, and suicide. The trials and travails of Annie, Nick, and Izzy-bear as they deal with these issues will have you crying and despairing as they muck their way through -- it will have you laughing and rejoicing when they triumph in the end. But this isn't a novel about issues and that's why it works. Their story captures your fancy on page one. It becomes a part of your heart by the end."
2,"Poor character development, bad dialogue","I bought this book based on the glowing reviews here. Big mistake. This book has an interesting premise and plotline. However, it is near fatally flawed by stilted, unrealistic dialogue (the male protagonist, especially, spouts dialogue that sounds like a teenage female's fantasy of what a man should say -- not even the most sensitive Alan Alda type would say this stuff) and poorly developed characters. Maybe Hanna has improved through the years (I don't know and won't find out, as I won't buy another of her books), but this book is NOT good."
5,Love my kindle,Great book. Wonderful author. Will read all books written by this author. You get very caught up in the story. Couldn't put it down!
4,Gotta Love Kristin Hannah,"This is the third Kristin Hannah book that I have read and again she didn't disappoint! She has a knack for developing great characters and stories with just enough drama to keep you reading. This is a story about a women who is going through major life changes after her daughter leaves for college. Her life is turned upside down and she has to figure out how to put her life back togeher and who will be there when she does. I don't like giving away too much about books in the review so that is all I will say. We read this for our book club and were amazed by the great discussion we had after. We didn't know if we would have a lot to discuss until we started reading the group discussion questions and the end of the book, we ended up talking for hours!"
5,A Fabulous Book!,"I was fortunate to receive a pre-publication copy of this book, and it is wonderful. I truly couldn't put it down. I grabbed my first tissue within the first ten pages. By the last third of the book, I'd given up on tissues and just pulled off long strips of toilet paper. BUT...it's that GREAT kind of crying, not the rip your guts out ugly kind. This book will please all of Kristin Hannah's romance fans as well as bringing her a new group of readers who gravitate more toward ""women's fiction."" A delicate path to walk, but Hannah pulls it off. I can't recommend On Mystic Lake highly enough."
2,Completely Unoriginal,"Having seen the reviews of this book, I was hoping for a great read. Instead, this book is an amalgam of every single romance I've ever read. It's completely unoriginal and predictable. I've read so many stories of women ""going home again"" after a setback, the wounded man/child, the town filled with stores with too cute names, the friends/sidekicks who are cariacatures instead of characters.The heroine goes home, meets up with her long lost love, heals his emotionally damaged child (what a surprise!) and ""finds"" herself. What a joke, the woman leaves LA only to find herself in the same role she held before, wife and mother. Oh, except in this book, she wants to open a bookstore.This book was a cliche from beginning to end. I won't buy another book by this author."
3,Beach Read Only!,"I looked forward to reading Ms. Hannah's novel On Mystic Lake after reading several synopses and reviews. However, it was a disappointing experience. The plot was predictable; the writing a notch above that found in a supermarket romance novel. At best it serves as escapist reading--reserve for beach reading only!"
2,TOO MANY ADJECTIVES!,"I have always loved Kristin Hannah's novels but this was simplistic, predictable, and the characters had no depth. They fit into every stereotype. But what really was aggravating was that adjectives were constantly overused. It became corny. If you are looking for an adjective for Mad Libs, this is the book to read."
4,First Kristin Hannah read,"Just finished On Mystic Lake and I did really like it. This is the first book of hers that I have read and I will be trying out another soon. This was a good light read that kept me interested and had some great life lessons to think of as well. Interesting and entertaining to me I finished it in only a few days. I may have found it more appealing being that I am a mother now, don't think I would have liked it quite as much before I had a child of my own.One thing I did not like about this book is that it shifts narrator and time without warning and can be a little awkward and confusing. I mean- I figured it out as I read, but a little space between shifts or a line or new chapter would have been a little better in my opinion. I like for the book to prepare me for seeing things through a different characters eyes. It obviously didn't put me off too much though, I am heading to the library today and plan to pick up another one of her novels."
4,oOn Mystic Lake,The story content was true to life. It depicted what happens when the husband is very much job oriented and spends hours building a career while missing out on the family history and the wife does what she thinks her role in this marriage is. The story reinforces the need to communicate within the family. I felt the story was very well written and I had a hard time putting the book down.
3,On Mystic Lake,"On Mystic Lake by Kristin Hannah was a cut above most contemporary romances. It is a story about a wealthy 39 year-old Stamford graduate (heroine) who finds herself dumped by her handsome, successful but unfaithful husband, after 20 years of marriage. After dropping their 17 year old daughter Natalie at the airport for her senior year in England, Annie's husband, Blake tells her he wants a divorce and he is in love with an attorney from his office.Annie winds up going back to the small town where she grew up and she rekindles a relationship with a guy from her past. Somewhat commonplace and predictable, BUT the writing style was more engaging than most romance dribble out there.Better than your average romance novel."
4,Worth the time..,"Brought tears of saddness and laughter....brought anger and joy....brought pain and healing all in one endearing story of love lost, found, and then lost and found again. Tough choices sometimes take great action, but will always be worth the trouble once ended. Read about the struggle(s) no woman should have to face, but fight along with Annie to find her true hearts desire and yours. The love of oneself and from another."
3,Hm......,"Okay, I liked the story. She's created her world and it crashes. I loved that she went home and that she became compassionately involved with a former friend's struggling child. I especially loved the relationship that began to bloom and the house that came to order under her gentle touch. I loved her dad...I loved Mystic Lake. What I did not love, however, was that her shallow, self-centered ex-husband soared back into the story with a twist that sort of gagged me. It was a great story but the ending was not what I wanted. Well-written by an intelligent author...it just didn't get me there."
5,A Beautiful Love Story,"This is a lovely story about love and loss. Kristin Hannah has a wonderful way of weaving a story and developing characters. I felt particularly connected to Annie and her journey of love, betrayal, and self-discovery. While this story may have been a bit predictable, it was incredibly tender and sweet. This was my second KH book (Firefly Lane--VERY good!), and most certainly not the last."
5,Never cried so many tears,"I thought this book was wonderful. It explored the reasons why Annie made the choices in her life that she made. As a single mother to 3 children, it also gave me the chance to re-examine the type of role model I am for my children in contrast to the type of role model Annie felt she was for her daughter. I'm not much of a romance novel person but this was exceptional."
5,Wow! Drop everything and get this book!,"Kristin has lived up to the much-hyped release. This is a fantastic, many-hanky read. I couldn't put it down! Finally real characters and an impact of the beautiful pacific northwest I can relate to! Great job!"
5,On Mystic Lake was heartwarming and uplifting.,"Love is the tie that binds and Ms. Hannah is a good story teller showing us that sometimes it is complicated too. She has a great ablility to make us feel the emotions her characters feel in those complex but maybe not too uncommon situations and to bring us entertainment that we want more of even when we finish the book. It's one of those books that keeps us wanting for the time we can sit and read just for the enjoyment of reading. Refreshing writing for women's fiction like Ms. Hannah's, will keep a newcomer like me coming back for more."
2,A depressing and realistic story of love and loss,"I really wanted to like this book, but found it depressing and dark and difficult to finish. The love and loss suffered by the main character was horrible and realistic. I really would discourage anyone who is having marriage issues to STEER CLEAR! Find a book that talks to the joy in long term, loyal relationships."
5,Couldn't put it down.,I loved Annie. She really was so human. Like losing track with her high school best friend and then she was gone. Nick and Issey's life were so sad but were built up again with Annies' help. I had to pull myself away from the book otherwise I would not have gone to bed. I enjoyed it until the end. It left you wanting something more.
3,"Though I knew better, i couldn't put it down.","Kristin Hannah well knows that many readers want a chance to start over, and escape to the simpler, earthier ""life on the lake"" like her protaganist. While there are elements that are contrived there is much about the story that is satisfying, and ultimately it is a easy evenings read with some useful insights- into the joys of domesticity, parenting, and coming through grief and finding happiness on the other side."
4,Enjoyable,"I don't usually read romance type books, but the Washington Post review sounded good. It was very enjoyable. The characters were realistic. I wasn't sure which way it would end, so I liked that it wasn't predictable."
5,A Wonderful Book -- totally enjoyable,Living in the Pacific Northwest made reading this book just like visiting a small town neighborhood--like Stanwood used to be---loved the main character and the little girl in the book just warmed my heart. Totally recommend this book
2,Nothing new or original,"Geez. Is there a woman alive in a romance novel anywhere that doesn't go from the rat to the love of her life? How predictable. How boring.And hey, I live in this neck of the woods and I never quite bought the descriptions of this area. It was too generic or too wooded or something. It just wasn't real.But then nothing in this book really is. The characters, the settings, the plot itself are all just superficial plastic stuff you've read about before.If a typical romance novel done up in Pacific Northwest flannel is all you're in the mood for, this is your book. But don't look for anything more than a flavored coffee moment."
2,Cry me a lake,"Finished On Mystic Lake this morning - even read the Discussion Forum. When a book features a discussion forum at the end, it's importance is raised for me. Must be good, must be meaningful, must have a message. Well, normally, Kristin Hannah reaches me. Loved Home Front. But On Mystic Lake - if I had a calculator at my side while turning the pages, I am sure I could count into the thousands how many times these characters cried. We get it, Kristin. Life is tough, disappointing, sad, maddening. Maybe a small child could be excused for her tears but relying on tears page after page to relay the characters' feelings is a cheap gimmick. I expected more from Hannah. This book was published in 2003 and I haven't read her books in sequence. Did she get better?"
2,MYSTIC LAKE DROWNS IN PREDICTABLY,"I took a stab at a new author, and was a little disappointed at the lack of depth in this particular story. The story line was too predictable for my taste. I will however try another by Hannah at some point."
5,The Best!,"This Chinese cleaver is beyond my expectations, having purchased another one at a Chinese grocery. It is heavy! Solid stainless and brass - not only a work of art, feels right in the hand, and being so solid opens young coconuts so much better than my first cleaver. Love it. Definitely a gift item."
5,Z balancing act!,"This cleaver is much better balanced than the wood handle one. It is extremely easy to sanatize. The balance allows you to cut right through the bone effortlessly and your hand does not get tired from swinging. A definate must if you butcher your own wild game or domesticated live stock(beef, pork, lamb, etc..) A definate over kill for poultry, but very efficient. May the force of the cleaver be with you, young grasshopper!"
4,good knife,this was a good knife and I use it all the time shipping was on time and I will order agine
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately Severn Meadows &#65533; Songs by Ivor Gurney is a disappointing recording, particularly since it is the first CD devoted entirely to Gurney's music. Gurney was a master of the song setting but this release does not do his splendid contributions to song literature justice. It is too similar in tone throughout and lacks the sparkle, color and intensity that other interpreters draw from Gurney's music. More disappointing and disturbing than the recording, however, are Michael Hurd's program notes in which he feels it necessary to repeat the irresponsible suggestion the Gurney suffered from syphilis. This information was presented to the public in 2000 without being carefully researched or documented and has, unfortunately, found its way into print too often as an explanation of Gurney's mental illness. Gurney did not suffer from syphilis or shell shock or paranoid schizophrenia. He suffered, as did Robert Schumann, from severe untreated manic-depressive illness. ..."
4,Polaroid One600 Classic Instant Camera,"I had been wanting a Polaroid camera for a few months and had been debating on whether or not I should buy a used one or pay more and get a new one. I finally decided on a new one and purchased it on Amazon. It was delivered earlier than expected which was a pleasant surprise. However, though it was packed with tons of bubble wrap, the casing of the product was scratched and when I opened it the camera itself had a few scratches. Since I had specifically chosen to pay more for a new camera I was disappointed that it wasn't in perfect condition. Overall, the camera itself seems to be working as expected."
3,polaroid,"i though that when i bought this camera i was going to love it, i do, but sometimes is like stuck for some reason. the light doesnt work properly."
5,"Polaroid, unique type of camera.","This is a reliable and unique camera that offers the ability to take, view, and give your photos in a few short minutes, something that digital cameras are unable to offer. This camera works well and Polaroid is name brand, it doesnt get any better than this !"
5,Love this camera,"This camera is such a pleasure to use. In freezing cold or searing heat -which we have a lot of in this area - it keeps cranking out the pictures. I also have a couple of digital cameras, but when I want a picture without having to deal with settings and other distractions, this is the camera I use. Love it!"
1,All sepia,"The photosnever got colorfull it all looked completely sepia. And the camera has the same size it always had, it is huge!"
1,Don't bother!,"Purchased this camera for my husband's dive business so he could instantly photograph his students who successfully completed their scuba course. That was in November. A friend did some research and found that the film is being discontinued this year (2009). I should have paid attention to the other reviewers who mentioned this. Why sell a camera that you can no longer buy film for?! It came from Adobe Camera and when I called them to get a RMA#, they asked why I was returning it. When I told them - no response - but I did get my money back for the camera and the extra film I purchased. Seems ridiculous to me for Amazon to be selling a product that will soon be totally useless, unless of course, you have lots of $$ to stock up on film (it' expensive - turns out to be about $1 a picture - don't make a mistake!)"
1,Film No Longer Manufactured,"While some stock still remains of the Polaroid film, they stopped making it several months ago. There is perhaps a year supply left on the market, after that it's GONE FOREVER. I have one of these cameras purchased last year. The price was $30. $299 is TOTAL RIP-OFF even if film was still being made. Do yourself a favor and get a Fuji Instax 200 or Instax Mini. Better quality (Made in Japan) MUCH better price ($45) and you won't have to worry about getting the film in the future."
1,Polaroid one 600 instant camera ultra,"I purchased this camera because of the promise of great, portrait quality prints, sharp image, 2 foot focus, etc. and am soundly disappointed. The quality of the prints is TERRIBLE-- fuzzy, no detail, etc. (and I am not a perfectionist!!) It feels cheap, the paper is expensive-- which I could accept if the quality were slightly above average-- but I consider this a TOTAL waste of money."
1,what a ripoff!!!,Okay I have to say that this seller is completely ripping you off if they are charging $140! You can get this camera at Target for $39.99 or at the Adesso website for $42.00! Talk about an unfair mark up!!!!!
1,DONT BUY THIS CAMERA AND SUPPORT POLOROID!,"I was stupid enough to buy a Poloroid, just four months ago and am now stuck with an instant camera that is useless, unless I want to spend TWO HUNDRED dollars for a pack of ten! Sweet corporate Poloroid decided to just quit making the film, even though the camera is still for sale everywhere and no one will tell you that you can't buy film for it, quite a nice little con they have going on. Instead invest your money with Fugi, they have BETTER instant cameras and they don't pull these kinds of games on the consumer. Poloroid deserves to go out of business, the sooner, the better!"
3,Wrong color,The camera was brand new and the packaging was in relatively good shape. And they even sent it in a very speedily manner. The only problem is they sent me the wrong color camera. But oh well. As long as it still takes the same pictures then there's no reason for me to fuss about it.
1,doesn't get warm,it barely gets warm. The heat part is what I bought it for. The massage doesn't do much for me.
5,Funny and Witty-A Comedy of Errors,"This is a very funny play by Shakespeare. It's very complicated, but the plot is sound. In the play, a shipwrecked woman pretends to be a man and falls in love with the Duke, for whom she is working. Her name is Viola. The Duke is madly in love with Count Olivia. He sends Viola to try to woo her in his name. Instead, Olivia falls in love with Viola, thinking she is a man. The plot thickens when Sebastion, Viola's twin brother, steps in. It is hilarious and has a fantastic ending, not to mention the Clown and other minor characters."
3,"A Good Paddle, but...","Fobus has come out with a good paddle holster, but I had to add lok-tite to the screws to prevent it from unscrewing with wear and the holster moving. I don't wear it often because I have since purchased a leather holster, but will use it occasionally."
1,Waste of time and money,No amount of adjusting to this unit made it usable. In fact the adjusting screws had no tension on them and still could not draw the weapon. Return was no problem.
3,Comprehensive but biased,"Being a high school senior looking to make it to a good college and narrow the process, I thought that this book would work for me. It did in some regards but did not in many. Although all fifty colleges and universities are written about very thoroughly (usually around 15 pages apiece) and there are a series of insightful appendices at the end of the book regarding applications, admissions, financial aid, etc., I found the actual copy of the book to be lacking in candidness. This is the problem with the book: each college/university is written about by a graduate of the college/university. Granted, one would assume that only graduates would have a clear and conscious handle of life on that campus, but in the end, each write-up seems to be the same ""come to our school, we're the best"" drivel that I could have gotten by visiting any admissions office."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"These movies are not ""funny"" stupid, they're ""running your head into a wall would be more interesting"" stupid.BAD MOVIE POLICE 1 & 2(GALAXY OF THE DINOSAURS & CHICKBOXER) were shot with a hand held camcorder.EDDIE PRESLEY is a boring drama about an some loser who lives in his van.TOWNIES is a boring black and white movie that promises a bunch of stuff but doesn't actually contain any of it. The description list a lot of wierd things but there actually just implied and are not really in the movie. I payed $5 for this movie and now that I've seen it, I wouldn't watch it again for $500."
4,"An interesting book, but not original and not very helpful","The author investigates a variety of conditions to see if they do or do not promote happiness. The focus of the book is psychological studies, making the ideas more scientifically authoritative. It's strong points are an entire chaper devoted to ""Love and Marriage"" and a chapter on ""Flow in Work and Play."" The book concludes with an epilogue listing the key points of the book in 2 pages. Three cheers for brevity!Anicius Boethius (480 to 524) wrote ""The Consolation of Philosophy"" long ago while he was awaiting his execution. Boethius covered all the key points in Myers' book long ago and was more eloquent. Myers' does not really give you a guide book for living a happy life. He says, ""The essence of happiness is pausing to savor the gift of our present moments."" There is so much more to living a happy, fulfilling life than that. I recommend ""Achieve Lasting Happiness"" by Robert Canright as a better guide for living a happy life."
5,One of the best books I have ever read,This is one of the best books I have ever read. On a whim I picked up this book for leisure and ended up using it to take another look at my life. Although the author does not come right out and tell you what it takes to be happy he gives you enough information for you to get some real good clues.
2,Valuable information - Poor style - Religiously biased,"This book is no fun to read. It is some kind of PhD thesis.The research is exhaustive, but the style is so poor that I doubt you will have the courage to reach the end.So, go straight to the end, there is a 2 pages summary which is definitely worth reading and remembering when people speak about ""unattainable happiness""."
4,New Theories re: old ideas,"Bart Ehrman has made a living treading the treacherous territories of New Testament scholarship. Very few things--except perhaps politics--can make more people agitated and angry the way discussion on religion does. Ehrman navigates this forest with aplomb. He makes no secret that he sees things a certain way, and he seems to have no qualms about laying out his evidence.Lost Christianities is something of a companion volume to Lost Scriptures in that they both aim to elucidate the beliefs of many early groups of Christians. In this book, Ehrman shows how different early ""Christians"" were from Christianity today--and how different from each other. His writing style is clear and fascinating, and it truly does justice to his topic. I have read other books of his, and I have yet to be disappointed."
4,Almost 5 stars!,This is dense reading and can be repetitive but the content is so interesting that it's worth pushing through. Very thought-provoking as to what lies as the roots of our faith.
2,Disappointing as with most of Ehrman's popular work,"It's hard to say whether I actually liked this book or not. I will say that it was exactly what I expected from Dr. Ehrman, being familiar with his writing. As always, his facts are flawless, his conclusions and hypemanship are worthless. He's a great read on early Christianity if you can skim past the hype and BS and get to the meat. I'd love to see him write an unbiased, nonjudgmental, truly scholarly work. I haven't seen one from him yet."
2,Another What-If Book,"Since Elaine Pagels' Gnostic Gospels there has been a steady stream of books written on the subject of lost options in Christianity. This is a particularly bad example of that genre because it misrepresents the substance and nature of almost every heresy and threat it proposes to assess. Especially weak is Ehrman's treatment of Marcionism which he fundamentally misunderstands and seems to know only from the dated studies of Knox and Harnack. His idea that Marcion's view of God was too ""new"" for the church to accept is based on a howling anachronism in the dating of Marcion's heresy. In fact there is plenty to suggest that Marcion's solitary gospel and limited collection of Paul's letters corresponded to (and resonated with) the most ancient inclinations of Christian theology. In short, not only yet another case of popularization but a bad job of reading the evidence as well."
3,Erhman the airhead?,"Erhman is a great man and a scholar who has lost his faith through his studying on the new testament. That being said. This book is great if you try to forget Erhman's agenda. (to think like he does) Pretty much like any other writer. This book gives a good in depth look and strive towards hidden gnostic and text that you won't see in any catholic apocrypha bible. This is awesome. I have used his book in essay at community college level. Check out him VERSUS STEPHAN COLBERT on youtube. Although, I only use it for his text on lost and hidden scripture, you may see his point of view in better ""darkness?"" then I have"
5,Send a copy to Mel Gibson,"Want a quick, succinct critique of this book? Scroll down four or five reviews to the review by Orvin Parrot from North Idaho. It tells all in one sentence."
1,holy smokes what a horrid book,"Ehrman's a really bright guy, but this is just plain bad scholarship. He's so concerned with showing any sort of Christianity to be irrational, he completely loses himself. Ehrman underqualifies nearly all of his positive claims, and when he summarizes views that contradict his, those views clearly obliterate any chance of his working at all. Take, for example, his discussion of ""secret Mark"". He really, really wants there to be a secret Mark, but he's a good enough scholar to present other's viewpoints. Even after presenting all the multi-faceted evidence that it was completely forged, he still just plain wants to think there was such a thing. This book reads much like the Da Vinci Code: really entertaining narrative, but pure fiction."
4,Expanding horizons,"I have read two other books by Bart Ehrman and I find his information enlightening. Additionally, his style of writing is relatively easy to follow and after reading other writings, it becomes familiar. In this day of increasingly narrow thinking and judgments, it is refreshing to find writing that is careful, reasoned and reasonable. I highly recommend it as a way of understanding just how diverse the early ""Church"" was and how much we have lost by closing in the boundaries of thought and faith."
4,good condition,I received the package in very good condition. I wish I had known when I placed the order that it would take 3 weeks to get it. The delivery time of 3 days to 4 weeks is too wide. This window should be narrowed.
4,Lost Christianities,"This being my first opportunity to read a Bart Ehrman book I must say it was an interesting (to say the least) and a surprisingly easy read. The one compelling theme or story line was the many and varied avenues that the beginning of Christianty moved toward and developed. Even being aware of the differing movements the story as Ehrman reveals it becomes more than revelation, more than history. It is a reminder that very often, if not always, the victors have their story told and told precisely as they deemed it to be. 'Truth be told' may well go the way of the so-called heretics writings, up in a fiery blaze!"
5,Many Faces of Christ,"This book taught: That people worshiped Yeshua the Christ in many ways, The idea of god varies, The most brutal group of leaders won the Christianity war, and more."
5,Documents ALL the original Christians.,"This book belongs in every persons home library that is on a quest for religious truth. Professor Ehrman takes us to the starting point of Christianity and shows the splintering of the church into the Pauline Christians, the Jersulem churches (followers of Jesus's brother), the Petrine Christians (Catholics),and the Gnostics later on. It is fascinating to read the history of how the proto-orthodox fought so hard about the theology of whether Jesus was man or God or both before the orthodox Christians came to dominate. It will take you from Jesus up to Constatine's Roman Catholic Church. Of the forty books I have read on Christian origins this is the best by far, due to it being written historically with out all the irrational emotion that accompanies the Atheist fundamentalists or the Christian fundamentalists.This is educational and fact based, by a teacher.I highly recommend."
4,"Fascinating view of strange early ""Christianities""","I had no idea that there were such a wide variety of beliefs in early Christianity -- the ""winning"" group so effectively destroyed all evidence of earlier texts. A great piece of detective work and a very well-written book."
3,"This book could do with a little less stream of thought, a little more precision","The book is a stream of thought project, somewhat. It has more form than that, but instead of going over each of the lost branches of Christianity and clearly setting them out, it mostly wanders over the same thesis again and again.It has flashes, three pages here, two pages there, of clear, concise and direct information. If you want to understand what a gnostic was -- great, there is a sharp explanation. But if you would like a good explanation of the rest of the baker's dozen of early Christian movements that are gone? No such luck.Sigh. Wanders too much. On the other hand, once you've read one of this author's books you've pretty much read them all, which is too bad. From the flashes of sharp writing, I'm certain he could have said a lot more and provided a lot more information. Too bad he lacked the discipline to do so."
3,wow $26?,must be out of print! buy it used.decent enough read. i was sucked right in.good character development! henry could not catch a break. and at every wrong-turn i could feel myself cringe. and the ending - good enough - there remained some glimmer of hope if only in a parallel fantasy world.the bad: henry's only hope for relevance was in his father's favor. just shoot me now. or shoot me later when i next read a book where the character is grovelling for familial attention.
2,"Well written, but I couldn't even finish","Bausch is an excellent writer but I had to quit before I reached the middle of this novel because I just could not understand the values and motivation of the lead character. Please, a teacher who bets at the racetrack and won't marry the woman that he gets pregnant! I had no empathy or sympathy for him. He was totally uninterested in his daughter also, and I just found him so unbelievable I didn't want to waste my time when I had so many other books to read. I'm surprised at all the glowing reviews. I just have to like (at least a little bit) the major characters in a novel. Maybe it was more easily understood by a male reader but this busy grandmother and teacher just did not get it."
3,A good starting point,"This book is a good discussion starter for why your church may be stuck at a certain level. It offers some good tips on how a church mught break through a given attendance barrier and what obstacles need to be overcome.This is a book for church leaders to read together. The first question they must answer after reading the book is, ""Do we want growth badly enough that we are willing to change?"""
4,"On average, a very useful book","The writing was lucid and what would otherwise have been a pretty bare and boring subject was made very readable. However the fictional account of 2 pastors (one new one, and a veteran pastor called 'Bob') grated on me after the first few pages. It comes over as somewhat self congratulatory in much the same way the scripted TV advertizements singing praises of a particular product do.McIntosh has tackled a tough topic and injected guidelines and a few thoroughly useful rules of thumb that have definitely improved my approach to ""doing church"". I just wish that he'd gone for a more savoury dish rather than the rich syrupy sugar glaze that this one has."
3,Simple and Helpful,I found this book to be a simple and helpful take on the various challenges and benefits of churches of various sizes.
2,repackaged new,"the music itself is great, great selections. the quality of the cd is suspect. the item was sold as new, but it looked to be just repackaged-new cellophane wrapping, the last 3 selections on cd 2 skip and stop, but there was no paper work included for a return of item. i, myself would n ot buy another item from Beaches Entertainment and am leary of using amazon again after this bad experience."
4,Great novel even better film,"Thea von Harbou (1888-1954) was indeed Fritz Lang's wife and wrote a number of novels/screenplays which Lang produced, including ""Il frau im Mond"" and ""Spione"". He divorced her in 1932 when she joined the Nazi party. ""Metropolis"" dates from 1926, NOT 1888 (von Harbou's birthdate). The first German edition, Berlin: A. Scherl, 273 pp., with a cover based on an original design by Walter Reimann was published in 1926, the anonymous English translation appeared in 1927. It retrospect the book is quite propagandist, but certainly quite unique. A 75th Anniversary edition is available, with numerous illustrations/stills from the film and an introduction by Forrest J. Ackerman, from Sense of Wonder Press, James A. Rock & Co. Publ."
1,The Characters are Caricatures,"The incessant repetition, the melodramatic characters, and the convoluted prose make Metropolis the novel an excruciating read. Seemingly only a masochist could love this book. If one feels absolutely compelled to read this book then my recommendation would be to borrow it from the local library instead of spending any money on it.Don't say I didn't warn you."
4,A Londoner,"These songs were recorded from 1905 through 1931 and, therefore, the sound quality is quite poor. However, the songs were well sung and a lot of fun. They were a cause for a chuckle or two (or maybe even three), especially, ""Waiting at the Church,"" ""Quite Alright,"" ""Grandfather's Clock,"" and ""When Father Papered the Parlour."""
5,Really Great Overview,This was written so wonderfully. I purchased the audiobook first and just had to have it in print. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in Microbiology. Best non-textbook I've ever read on the subject. We homeschool and this will be required science reading!
4,Interesting,"I know nothing about DNA, and this is my first ever book to read about the subject. The book is well written and whats really great about it is that its written by someone that has witnessed it all. The author is very opinionated, but this made the book even better. I don't agree with him on a lot of things but he presents his opinion in a very proper manner and does his best to back it up. The book gets too ""scientific"" in many areas but I guess there is no escaping that when you pick a book about DNA. The author tries to explain everything as clearly as he can, but there are areas where this was not enough. Over all this is a very good book to read. The most important question raised by this book is: nature or nurture? The answer isn't as simple as it seems and most probably wont be what we think it is."
1,Evolution of Bad Science,"Firstly, DNA is not the secret of life. Even Darwin emphasized the role of ""the Creator"" in evolution, e.g. in guiding the evolution of the eye. Secondly, evolution through inheritance of acquired characteristics has been proved. Watson makes out that it is a failed theory. Thirdly, Watson seems to have a view of genetic engineering that reminds me of the H.G. Wells novel, The Island of Dr. Moreau. He says that absolute courage will be needed to perform human experiments, following experiments on monkeys and chimps. Fourthly, he downplays the role of Rosalind Franklin in the discovery of the double helix. Fifthly, there is of course no evidence for macro-evolution. Evolution through inheritance of acquired characteristics only occurs within a species; there are no common ancestors. Overall, very disappointing."
4,"Sturdy, just about perfect","I bought this case for my Canon Elura 100. The case is semi-rigid and well constructed. It seems very strudy... the stiching, zippers, padding, speaks of quality. There was really only one minor drawback for me. The pocket for the camcorder itself is rather large. It would have been nice to have a velcro insert to divide the space, making the pocket smaller to better fit the camera. It really not that big of a deal, I use the extra space to carry extra tapes with me."
3,"Nice case, too big for me","I have the ZR500 miniDV camcorder. The case is designed well and can fit plenty of accessories as well as my digital camera and all of it's accessories. Based on the reviews, I assumed it was the right size for my camcorder only. Not a bad bag... just a bit large for people that like compact."
5,Great Gift,"I purchased this item as a gift for an amateur photographer. It was a great success! The storage space is roomy enough to fit both a Canon camera and a Canon video camera. It is a very well designed bag, and a great price. As usual, anything you buy directly from Amazon is delivered quickly, and arrives well packaged.This is a great gift for someone on the move with small cameras and/or video eqt."
4,Canon SC-A70 Soft Case,"Purchased for my Canon Elura 100 camcorder... Compact and holds the camera, accessories, and extra tapes well. I could use a bit of extra room, but then the bag would have to be larger, so this isn't a big deal. Good value for the price."
2,Price is Right,"The inside space is wasted(not designed smartly).The zipper knobs(holders)are metal.So,they make too much noise which makes carrying the bag annoying and embarrassing. It is ideal for storing an unused camera to avoid it from gathering dust. It is definitely worth$7.00. It is good for a camcorder, not a camera."
1,Too big for canon hfs-10 camera,This case is too large for the camera....Canon needs to make one that fits the camera snugly and can be worn on a belt.
3,A bit large for mini DV,"The case looks great and seems well made. It is divided into two sections. One for accessories; flash cards, tape. The other side is for the camera which is still very large for miniDV camcorders. I would of liked to see the camera side smaller for a tighter more secure fit, and the accessory side larger."
4,Fits gr8 for my Canon DC 40.,I have Canon DC40 and this bags fits my camcorder/ battery pack/ power adaptor and extrta dvd disks with cases. It has a small top chamber which I use to carry my compact camera. Very handy.
2,Good quality but limited functionality due to design.,The case quality is quite good but unfortunately I cannot recommend it due to the design. The case has pop-out sections on both sides. These sections pivot from the bottom to about an 45 degree angle. Because of this it is difficult to access the camera and associated cables / other equipment.In hindsight I would by the case from a local retailer so that I could see/touch it first. At a minimum do that and then by one you like from Amazon.
3,Smaller than expected,The item was a little smaller than expected but I was able to fit everything into it. Now I have everything I need when I'm on the go - all in a tiny traveling case.
3,A little too big for a compact cam bag,I was hoping this soft case would be small enough to protect the camera while still being able to slip in my purse. It's way too BIG and BULKY! I just wanted a case to house the camera while I go to sporting events for my kids. This is like carrying a piece of luggage! Not my ideal case.
2,Annoying Guide,"I am new to Macs, and rusty with computers. I needed a good basic book, but even I found this book baby talks way too much. As I work through it, I'm finding it to be very annoying that there are endless instructions to go to another page for continued information. She has me flitting around from beginning to back to middle to beginning, etc. With writing like that, of course there is going to be constant repetition of information. Besides putting you to sleep, it makes you wonder if you've already read that section. You'd need a map and a highlighter to know. I don't have time for this."
5,Correction to review,"I'm the reviewer who wrote the first review of this book listed above and my review contains an error: Scott Kelby's group is the National Association of Photoshop PROFESSIONALS (not USERS as I wrote in the review). The association is indeed dedicated to Photoshop professionals. I don't know where ""USERS"" came from -- Sorry Scott."
5,Wonderful Introduction To the Critics P.O.C Of Fairy Tales,"Jack Zipes is perhaps the most renowned critic in writing about Fairy Tales. I love his style because he doesn't really show what he really thinks about them butt how the Fairy Ta;es have been shaped through out the centuries.Some how or another he is able to find excellent resources and drawings for the book. I highly believe it is for any one who is interested in starting to study, the true origins of Fairy Tales."
2,Not enough trouble-shooting information.,"When a Mac works properly, one does not need a book. I buy books like The Mac OS8 Book to help me when I am in trouble. When OS 8 freezes and crashes (and it does!) the book offers no help. I was disappointed."
3,Mac Os 8 for Beginners,"This is the manual Apple should have supplied with Mac Os 8. I would certainly recommend it for beginners or new users. However this book offers no real help to users wishing to resolve problems or to experienced ""Macusers"" This appears to be an issue with almost all ""System"" books written for the Macintosh. For those people looking for a users manual on system 8, a good buy."
4,Interesting book,"Its telling how rare this book is that abebooks has it listed under rare going for $800-$1000.A good modern day parallel, in the sense of analysing Culture and Female Sexual Freedom on it is F Roger Devlin. Google him."
1,"I would give ""0"" stars if I could!",I bought the first unit in August 2007. It worked fine for a few weeks then decided to quit (just went blank!). I called Toshiba and was referred to an authorized service dealer. The unit stayed at the service center for 1 month waiting for circuit boards that never came because they were not available from Toshiba (A relatively recently produced unit and Toshiba does not even have replacement parts: that tells you something!). Finally Toshiba agreed to replace the unit and I received my current TV 1 month later. Now the DVD does not work properly and keeps on pixelating and skipping (I cleaned and played multiple DVDs but the problem persisted). I called Toshiba and insisted that I need a replacement for my replacement. They could not care less. All they were willing to do was to send me back to the service center.This is the last Toshiba product I will buy.
3,"Toshiba 23"" LCD HDTV","Not the best picture I've ever seen but a good value for the money. DVD player is kind of clunky but again, a pretty good value for the price paid."
2,Its Good while it lasts,I bought this product on sale at Circuit City in Oct. '07. I used it to play games and watch movies. I recently moved in to my apartment and when I unplugged my Xbox and hooked up my cable box it fried the HD RGB component inputs. Between parts and labor it would be almost exactly the same price as what I got the TV for. Do not buy this product.
5,love it,"great sound, clear & beautiful picture, & perfect size for the bedroom...i got the hd hooked up & now i watch tv in bedroom all the time, expeciallymy husband...."
3,"Toshiba 23HLV87 23"" LCD HDTV with Built-In DVD Player","Replacement TV for bedroom after storm damaged several items in house. TV was purchased because of inexpensive cost, now I know why. Very noisey DVD player when first turned on. Channel flicking has a delay between switching before screen pops back on and I still can't figure out the channel return button on the remote (return to previous channel)if there even is one. Picture is OK but what is with this switching channels and the pictures all using different formats? The FCC has made things more complicated than ever out of watching TV. HDTV may make the picture better but it needs to work on making things uncomplicated for the average user."
2,tv broke after 40 minutes!,"It is unreal. After the TV arrived and I had set it up, the TV worked for 40 minutes and then went blank and failed completely. I brought it to an authorized dealer and was told a circuit board broke and needed replacement. The TV was fixed free of charge under warranty and is now functioning OK. However, I never had a new TV that worked for only 40 minutes before it broke."
2,Toshiba 23HLV87,Bought this for the kids playroom. Perfect size. Picture is fine for kids shows and movies. We mounted it on an adjustable/tilt wall bracket. (Without the tilt mount the picture was horrible when watched at an angle from below - lying on the floor looking up). One week after the 1yr warranty expired the DVD would not eject from the player. Unplugging the unit for a few hours fixed the problem. Hopefully it won't happen again.
1,Bootleg DVD!,"This is a bootleg copy! DO NOT BUY!!! DVD came in a black DVD case with cover artwork that was obviously printed with an inkjet printer. The DVD-R itself had the artwork printed directly on the DVD-R using an inkjet printer (poor quality), and the recordable side was purple in color (obvious DVD-R). Seller has been reported to the FBI for copyright infringement!"
5,Fatal North Got Lost in the Shuffle,"I believe that this excellent book should have received the coverage and the praise that books such as Endurance and Isaac's Storm received. It is at least as entertaining and well written, and even has a few unexpected surprises in the account. You cannot go wrong with this book if you have any interest in true adventure or exciting exploration accounts. Superb book."
3,"Fatal North: No footnotes, no bibliography","Fatal North is a compelling account of Charles Francis Hall's last expedition. Bruce Henderson does a good job of painting the personalities of the officers and crew, a number of whom never got along with Hall -- or one another.But but the lack of any footnotes nor any bibliography makes the reader wonder whether parts of this drama actually occurred, or whether they flowed from Henderson's pen. Those seaching for a more scholarly account would do well to stick with Chauncy Loomis' landmark work, ""Weird and Tragic Shores,"" and, of course, Pierre Burton's ""Arctic Grail,"" which has an excellent chapter on Hall."
3,Made for TV?,"This a very readable book. After finishing The Icemaster by Houston, and Ice Blink by Cookman, I felt that this was a script rather than a book. It tied in nicely with some of the opening chapters of Ice Blink, however. The avarice of Buddington seemed extremely drawn out and causes one to wonder if such evil can truly exist in a man who has volunteered for such an expedition. Still this is another good work in the plethora of Polar expedition books that we have been blessed with in the past year. On to the Poles!"
3,Baby Bassinet,Price was extremely good! Easy to assemble. The only problem was with the wheels. We still have been unable to put them on correctly. If you want it to be stationary then great.
3,What a guy might do for a beautiful lady !,"When a guy falls for a beautiful lady and can dream of nothing but making love to her the rest of his life, then the kind of thing he is willing to do to keep her as his trophy is exemplified in this movie. Ashley Judd seems to have the most perfect body on screen."
3,This movie is actually pretty good,"Yeah, some parts of this movie, including the ending, are trite. Overall however, the film is very engaging. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it even better. I was glued to the screen! Judd gives a great performance and her wild, messed up, irrational, intelligent character is entirely believable. Luke Perry doesn't do a bad job either. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to escape to a twisted world for a couple of hours. It's a disturbingly pleasureable experience."
4,Manic Bonnie & Ex-cop Clyde for the Millenium!,"This movie was fantastic! Luke Perry is great as a man who will do anything for his woman (and you won't believe all he does)! Ashley Judd redefines acting as a manic depressive addict who will do anything for a thrill. This movie is excellent for anyone who has ever been in a dysfunctional relationship, and trust me, it will make you feel like your problems were pretty small. The action is solid, the acting, again, top-rate, and the plot is very unpredictable and non-stop. You have to see this!"
4,Bonnie and Clyde Mix Up,If you ever saw the movie Bonnie and Clyde with Faye Dunaway and Warren Batty you will know what I'm taliking about. This is a more up to date version and the charaters have switched. Judd being more like Clyde really in to guns and the thrill of the bad life and Perry being more like Bonnie excited but wants a normal life. I would have given the movie 5 stars but Judd doesn't seem to like shirts in the movie and being a girl I'm not really intrested. But a great movie.
2,This movie was horrible!,"Ok, so it had Luke Perry in it. That is the only posistive thing to say. The plot was underdeveloped and dragged on. the characters were uninteresting and not very credible. Why Ashley Judd had to be naked in half the movie I don't know. All in all, a frustrating story with a very unsatisfying ending."
2,Watch this for a laugh,"This film was completely off target. You are supposed to feel bad for the wrongfully convicted character, but he is too scruffy to take serious. The supposed underage victim, shes in real life a train wreck and wouldnt pass for an 18 year old. This chick looks like she is pushing 40 and in no way possible, should ever try to portray a teenage girl! Bad casting, very bad acting, very few costume changes, 10 cent wardrobe. My suggestion to you.....stay far away from this bomb"
1,Warning!!!Pedophile Released,"Upon watching this movie, I found no redeeming value. The movie was aimless and the title misleading. All I can say is ""God, help these actors."""
1,disapointment,"about as exiting as watching grass grow. even more tedious than bronw bunny, and that takes some beating."
1,Warning!!! Pedophile Released,"STUPID, NO TALKING. This was a bad movie. The description of this movie makes it out a great movie. They don't tell you that all it is, is a girl walking around everywhere getting raped and beat up but no sound. There is no talking, well at least the first 20 minutes of it. That was all we could stand of watching it hoping it would get better but never did. Waste of money!!!"
1,Too many inaccuracies,"This books has a lot of color maps and contains some nice photographs of archeological digs as well as photographs of the land today. Unfortunately, the history and text is inaccurate on too many points to be of any use as a reference tool for a casual tourist or a biblical scholar. Of the 200+ books on history, The Middle East, archeology, and the Bible that I have read in the last 18 months, this one was the worst."
2,lacking in simple abundance,"Despite professing a desire to get away from stereotypes, the book reaffirmed the idea that men and women can't understand each other without the aid of trite touchy-feely books like this one. I felt that this book didn't cohesively address ANY of the issues of manhood. Some of the essays were genuinely touching, but most of the ones I really liked didn't illuminate manhood but personhood. Breathnach's introductions and comments were by far the worst parts. They framed the simple musings of the essays awkwardly, imposing structure and themes where they didn't belong."
2,Maybe it just wasn't what I was looking for,"If you visit Ms. Breathnac's site, you will find helpful advice for meditating and a new outlook on incidents in your life. The book did not offer that, though it proposed to. Her charity work is tremendous and the woman seems to have an endless amount of love and energy. The book seemed more like Chicken Soup for the Soul with a test at the end than anything that offered daily guidance and affirmations. But like I said, maybe it just wasn't for me."
2,A Woman who loves Men in Abundance?,Contributors to this fine anthology of male authors would be far better served without the unnecessary and cloying tailpieces tacked onto their work by Author-Publisher Sarah Ban Breathnach. The jacket photo of foxy Sarah tells it all. The girl's gotta have the last word.
1,Magic Town,I purchased this product not realizing that it was coming from the UK Region 2 (silly me for not knowing what that meant) and therefore is not viewable on my BluRay DVD player due to the incompatible format. It is surprising to me that such a jewel of a movie that is a product of Hollywood is not available on DVD in the US. Go figure.
2,What you can't see in the picture,2 stars maybe an unfair rating. The clock looked different than what I expected. There are strips of bamboo wrapped around where the wires meet and the clock face looks like a cheap piece of paper.
5,Surpisingly great taste :-),"It did take me a while to 'pluck up the courage' to try this. I guess the thought of lime gum seemed repulsive to me, but to be honest, it is so unbelievably refreshing and yum. I really love it and the flavour lasts for a long long time. By the time you're ready to get rid of your piece, it's still full of flavour. I love the small pieces and it's a nice soft gum that doesn't go hard in your mouth even after a half hour. I think this is one of the nicest and juiciest gums I've tried and I'm chewing mine very sparingly as it's going to be a while before I'm back in America to go buy more. I love all the Orbits that I've tried, yet this is the best flavour."
4,Gusto bowls,"These bowls are really very nice. They're actually bigger than I expected, which is a good thing. The color is quite pleasing and they're well weighted. I would not hesitate to recommend this product to other cutomers."
5,Great Gusto!,"Purchased Fiesta dinnerware set, which had small cereal bowls. I have a hubby that likes his soup ""in a real bowl""! The gusto bowls are really great. They hold a generous serving of soup (hubby-sized) and also great for a good-sized salad or popcorn. These bowls also work great as serving bowls. I ordered from Mega China and first order arrived broken but Mega immediately sent out a very-well-packed replacement for the first shipment. I was very pleased with the level of customer service and the dishes are perfect. I'll be getting more."
3,"Nothing new here, same old concepts, same old format.","I was looking for some inspiration here. Maybe some new ideas, some new way of teaching or explaining concepts. However, sadly, it didn't happen. I've casually looked through the book and that is probably as far as it will go. If you are considering this book; and you have other instructional painting and drawing books, save your money, because all the information in your other books is in this one."
3,"okay, but not the best","if you really want to listen to punk, check out the british stuff -- by this i mean The Clash and the sex pistols. The ramones are cool, but their congs lack, like, meaning, unlike the political messages that come across in clash songs or sex pistol songs like ""anarchy in the uk"" or ""god save the queen"". american punk was never, and never can be better, than what the british have to offer. ramones have the sound, the beat, but lack message. you know, like, meaningful lyrics. i hate to burst your bubble, but ""kkk took my baby away"" doesn't have all that much substance, although it is pretty cool song. anyway, to sum it up, check out the brits. they're simply better."
2,What's the big deal?,"I could never understand what people saw in the Ramones. Why does anyone wanna buy a CD from a band that plays the same song over, and over, and over, and over....? True, it's a classic, and I will admit to liking ""Warthog Boy"" and ""Blitzkreig Bop"", but other than that, what's the point? If I were you, I'd wait to see them live. If that's not possible, at least get a live video."
3,A decent retrospective of one of the best punk bands,"This collection got me into the Ramones, but some of the stuff from the 1980s (i.e. Somebody Put Something In My Drink, Bonzo Goes To Bitburg, etc) was pretty bad. But it's worth it for songs like ""Teenage Lobotomy,"" ""Psycho Therapy, ""Blitzkrieg Bop,"" and many other excellent Ramones songs. RIP Joey and Dee Dee."
5,Gimme Gimme Ramones Mania,"If you're just discovering the Ramones, buy ""Ramones Mania"" first: it's the perfect punk primer. This album contains most of their best original songs. The few covers on it are relatively obscure. I have all of the Ramones' albums, but this was my first and it's still my favorite."
2,It's Not Enough,"Don't start with this one. It's a nice colorized compilation, nice and clean and late '80s sounding, bridging the catalog and welcomed at fraternity parties. But the mania was massacred. You want the band these reviewers are headbanging about? ALL THE STUFF AND MORE Vol 1. Today your love, tomorrow the world."
5,Wonderful indeed.,"I just want to thank the Ramones for making my life more enjoyable. I've got every album and know every word. Their music instantly puts a smile on my face. This one starts out perfect and never lets up. These are perfect rock songs and why they never achieved mass popularity convinces me of the dubious tastes of middle America. I mean, the 70s, Kiss?! Cheap Trick?! Peter Frampton?! Aerosmith!? Come on people! The Ramones ARE rock'n'roll. ""Sheena is a Punk Rocker"" alone is perhaps the greatest pop song ever written. The Ramones... thank you."
5,"Turn up the RAMONES,throw away Green Day.","The kids are alright! This CD is as good as it gets,period.Buy the dang thing,stop putting it off! Heck,do a friend a favor,buy TWO!"
5,A garage band that has been around the block,"The Ramones have been able to keep the raw sound of a garage band, the pace of a punk band and the tenacity of a pop icon for enough years and albums to be considered serious artists. They've ridden the new wave and have a backlog of tunes that prove it. Listen to this album without a half-dozen songs making you energetic and hang it up, friend. You're a zombie or have had a lobotomy. one, two, three, four...."
5,Essential even to the fan who owns all the studio albums,"The Ramones are possibly the greatest band in the history of rock music, but they always ordered their albums very strangely. ""Blitzkreig Bop,"" although it was the first track of the Ramones' first album, plays better as the ninth track in this 30-song-lineup. I feel cheated when I listen to any of the Ramones' studio albums from beginning to end becuase it's clear the band didn't take the time to order their tracks properly. (Organization was never really their thing...) This compilation is missing a few great tracks like ""Questioningly,"" ""Havanna Affair,"" and ""It's Not My Place,"" but it is still a must-buy to everyone, even if you already have all the studio albums or the other compilations."
2,Don't Bother,I was not happy with this antenna in fact I already replaced it with a rabbit ear style wich works to my satisfaction I thaught with the dipole antenna I was getting off cheap but when it did not work It was just added to the total price of what it took to satisfy me!
4,A Good Switch,"I needed to buy a switch to put in a server rack, and for what I was doing I didn't need a managed one. This one is very good for the price range. I looked at the D-Link DGS-1024D, but was concerned about the green nature of the device, if somehow I would have issues (every review was good but a few made me go elsewhere). One issue I had was the holes on the rack mounting brackets didn't line up well, but was easily resolved with a dremel. The main reason I bought this switch was to replace a bad Netgear GS116 that couldn't be mounted, and was completely full. I should have purchased two so I can replace the switch in the other rack, but I decided to wait for a couple of months to see how this one worked out."
5,Journalism As It Should Be!,"I never could stand aesthetic writers, those who would have you believe that life is full of ""please"" and ""thank-you."" That's precisely why Bragg is one of my favorites. I can trust him to tell the truth. I have always believed that it would be great to sit on the porch with Bragg and pick his brain. But after finding ""Somebody Told Me,"" I am filled with a sense, for the time being, of utter satisfaction. Here is what journalism should be; one would never line a birdcage or wrap fish with any of these stories. I was so in love with this book, I bought a second copy and sent it to a friend. If you know a fledgling writer, this is the book that will provide the best example of what a real journalist's work should do, pierce the soul."
4,"Hmmm, interesting book!","This was a fairly good book, and Mr. Bragg certainly has a way with the written word. The text had a tendency to drag on for what seemed like an eternity -- but I held on through the entire volume and was eventually glad I did. The ending is spell-binding and imaginative. I also liked Bragg's Jessica Lynch book."
3,Not like his novels,"If you loved Ava's man, all over but the Shoutin, etc., as I did you might be disappointed. These are simply news stories from his paper days. Well written but just news."
5,Like that old blanket you'll never throw away,"I look upon this album with the same fondness I feel for Star Trek re-runs. It's a little corny at spots, Adrew Bell has not yet realized his incredible vocal skill, and niether has Vince Clark reached his peak. Yet it was the beginning of something grand and after all these years, it still ranks as one of my favorite albums. The orchestral interpretations are always an aid while I'm having a bout with depression and, in my opinion, worth the price of the album themselves. If you have a fondness for the early eighties, buy this and you will find it a perfect fit!"
2,Does not work well,Nice idea but not very secure (thin wire) and the alarm easy to defeat. Buy the larger heavier wired Kensington model. I also recommend the keyed version rather than the combination lock. It just works better.
1,Don't waste your time!,I don't know what the point of this book was. It took 102 pages to develop the so called 'mystery.' I knew I should have stopped reading but all the reviews had said what a good writer this author was. I stuck with it and now regret doing so. This is a very simple book with a lot of things that need to happen in a cetain way and of course they do. The characters seem to be living in the 1930's even though this takes place in current time. They all are naive people. This is my second book by this author and I will not make the mistake of reading a third book! You shouldn't either.
2,Seven steps too many.,This book started out as an interesting study in two very different person's obsessions. It opened up a lot of threads that basically did not sew up to much. Each of the story lines just fades. I felt like the writer just got lazy. The couple of plot twists at the end are plain annoying as most of the characters also turn out to be. I picked up this book because I'd not read a Ruth Rendell and the cover reviews were excellent. I'll not pick up another.
1,This Book Made Me Angry .....,"because it was so d@mn stupid! This is the only I've ever read by Rendell and to hear the reviews you'd think it was going to be the most interesting, heart racing book ever ... which critics are rating this book!? I usually only read nonfiction and after I read this, I think I'll stick to what I know.This book was overly simplistic and just plain ridiculous. I could have told you the ending by page 50. It was supposed to take place in current time but you would never know it by how some of the characters spoke. The plot was laughable the ending was just plain stupid. This book was aggravating to read, my husband had to hear me constantly yell, `oh, you've got to be kidding me with this crap'.I'm not big into fiction, I get more out of a story that I know actually happened however if you want a good suspense fiction book try `Tell No One' and at least get your moneys worth."
2,Hard to believe this is by Ruth Rendell,I've enjoyed Ruth Rendell's books through the years but was shocked by this one. The plot was ridiculous and implausible. Although Mix would have had to paint his wall after the murder it is never referred to again. Why Neressa would allow Mix into here home simply didn't wring true regardless of Ms. Rendell's justification. I also didn't understand why the police were in the back garden and the old lady allowed Mix to leave for his sister's house. And the Iraqui was out of left field and bizarre. What a disappointment from someone who was a fine writer of psychological suspense.
2,It just did not grab me.,One cannot always explain why things are. Why do I not like vanila ice cream while someone else loves it? This book just wasn't that enjoyable.
3,Suspenseful but too fussy...would have made a better short story.,"In a nutshell...a very readable story with lots of ""Oh they're bound to catch him now"" moments; so good as far as suspense goes but a let down at the end in that it just well, ended...nothing remarkable at all.I felt the book was too padded out with stuff that was really irrelevant, like the doctor that Gwen writes to (after reading his wife's obituary) in the hope of resuming their romance from half a century ago. Or the clairvoyant that everyone seems to visit and whilst she does tend to `see things' relevant to the characters...it's still really unimportant. The fixation with Narissa doesn't really need to be there either or her fixation with some other guy whom she realises isn't for her anyway.I'm glad I read it, it wasn't a bad read...I like suspense but not the best."
4,Great Characters -- A Little Slow,"Like many of the people who've rated this book, I too am a huge Ruth Rendell fan. However, I was fairly disappointed with the ending--the wayward Iraqi again! It starts a bit slowly -- unlike most books -- the best part is the middle. The characters are beautifully written and three-dimensional. No one gets into the minds and pecadillos of psychos like Rendell."
2,Usually a fan,"I have read most of Ruth Rendell's books (including Barbara Vine) and I was disappointed by Thirteen Steps Down. I feel like she rushed to finish it. The Iraqi comes out of nowhere and that plot just destroys any suspense the book originally had. If you haven't read any of her books please start with some of her older ones such as ""A Tree of Hands"" or ""No Night is Too Long."""
3,This is the PRE-PHILLES Ronettes,"For any of those expecting those Philles hits, this is the wrong CD. ""Silhouettes"" is a compilation of recordings from the group's time with ""Colpix Records"" (1961-1962) Here you'll find the group's cover version of The Rays' 1957 hit ""Silhouettes"" as well as their original compositions ""My Guiding Angel,"" ""I Want A Boy,"" and ""Recipe For Love"" (among several others of course.) A notable omission from this CD is ""You Bet I Would"" (the original b-side of the single ""Silhouettes"" back in '62) However, every other known track is here.I must say though that the packaging is a little disappointing. What you see here, is what you get; no photographs of the group, no liner notes, no information on any of the songs, no history of the trio's time with the record label, nothing. Oh well, at least the songs are good."
2,What a noise!,"I have just bought an advanced thinkpad dock with integrated power supply. It is ""Made in Japan"" 39T4569 ( 42W4629 ) the problem is the inner fan is ALL THE TIME ON with a loud noise you can compare to vacuum cleaner or old PC ""big tower"" produced 10-15 years ago. I have bought this for T61 laptop which is a very silent one. Any regular dosktop PC (not laptop) would make less noise nowadays than this dock alone."
5,Easily lets my ThinkPad serve as both my home and travel computer,"The Advanced Docking station for specific Lenovo ThinkPads lets me easily take my laptop with me and quickly reconnect to full-sized keyboard, mouse, large monitor and four additional USB devices when I return the ThinkPad to its dock. I enjoyed a Mini-Dock prior to owning the Advanced Docking station, but the Mini-Dock did not let me leave the ThinkPad closed for use with external monitor and keyboard. Amazon's product description is complete and accurate."
3,Sounds like a cheap fish tank filter,"This thing sounds awful when you put a graphics card in it. Like a low, grinding drone like a cheap Walmart fish tank filter. Without a graphics card it's kinda useless, as you can only expand to one monitor. Overall I would say this is worth $50, not $120, but if you really want a dock I guess it's the only noisy, gigantic thing you have as an option."
2,super easy review of kirekegaard,Well developed synopsis of the most important contributions from Kirkegaard. Only the very top of the iceberg has been touched in this book however. The idea of making it a comic book does not add anything. It confuses and is not funny. The book misspells two important Danish words.
5,"Amusing, thoughtful summary","Amusing, thoughtful summary of Kierkegaard's major tenets. I love images and the cartoons are just the thing to help the author get Kierkegaard's point across. Neither the text nor the cartoons are trite but are right to the point."
3,Informative but limited approach to Kierkegaard,"The ""For Beginners"" series provides much towards understanding basic concepts of major thinkers. I own a few these books. However, I think that interpretations of Kierkegaard in this series (both in ""Kierkegaard For Beginners"" and ""Existentialism For Beginners"") do not due justice to the Christian convictions which informed Kierkegaard's life and works.The creative illustrations and clear address of major concepts are positives of this book, yet it interprets Kierkegaard through the lens of 20th century existentialists (e.g. Sartre), offering little to elucidate the Christian nature of Kierkegaard's writings."
3,Zune Car PAck,"Doesnt work as well as I would like for it to. Stations get a lot of static, not clear music listening."
2,Zune Car Pack,The car charger is great but the FM modulator is not. I get a lot of static when using this device no matter what channel I put it on. I would recommend a cassette converter instead if you still have a cassette player in your vehicle.
2,Sound quality mediocre,"I ordered this item and installed the product as per the instructions. The unit worked as described, but the sound quality is lacking. There's some static and the sound switches often from one frequency to another. The price of the product is reasonable and since the auto-charger cable works, it's worth the money. For much better sound buy a small adapter cable and connect your headphone jack to you car audio systems LINE jack."
2,signal too weak for antenna to pick up,"My zune has to be within one inch of the antenna for it to receive the radio station. Since, like most cars, my antenna is outside the cab, this product is worthless"
2,"poor sound in car, OK for linking to home radio","was very disappointed with sound quality in car, constant static on FM kink no matter what option selected. It works better at home if I want to listen to Zune music via one of my home HD radios. Not sure I'd recommend for car"
2,It's a piece of JUNK!,"I had this product for about a month, and it broke. I took care of it, never did anything to cause damage to it. One day, out of no where, it stopped staying plugged in to my zune (like, it was physically plugged in, but it wouldn't recognize that it was attached to my zune) so I unplugged it and plugged it back in and the metal piece that plugs into the zune literally crushed into the radio adapter. It's made of crappy, cheap plastic. Not to mention, there were many times where the radio signal would just randomly cut out and get staticy, so the sound quality isn't very good either. It's not worth the $79.99 they WERE charging for it (WTF?! Seriously?!) and it's barely worth the $7 they're charging now.I have a different zune car pack now that isn't as bad. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this particular one."
2,Zune car pack,I can not get a station to tune in on my zune. The adapter will not sound clear and I have to move the zune player and adapter up in the air and all around to try to find a good position. Thought it was just my local area where I live but when we went on a roadtrip I still had trouble. The charger was great to use. I am glad I did not pay alot for this item.I have a friend who has an ipod and his car adapter works great.
1,Complete waste of money,Stay away from this car pack. I don't feel too bad about cause it was on [...] bucks but ya don't expect cheap prices to yield quality. All static in my Mini Cooper with a faint song playing through the static. GARBAGE! I could have bought a pack of smokes and got more satisfaction.
1,Zune Car Pack,"This was a terrible product. I thought I was getting a great deal but it was horrible. I plugged it in and the reception is awful. I can only slightly hear my Zune over the terrible static. Even though this product is a great price, it simply doesn't work. Don't waste your money."
1,Does NOT come with data transfer cable shown in picture!,The title says it all. It did NOT come with the data transfer cable shown in the picture! The price was right for all three products but now I feel cheated out of my money! BOOOOOOOO you MAN!BOOOOOOOOOooooooOOOOHHHHH!F N BOOOOOOooo
3,"Charger almost worth the price, FM modulator is trash","The pack includes a cigarette lighter charger for the Zune as well as an FM modulator. The FM modulator is useless. Even if you can get a good signal from it by sticking it right up against the antenna, you will have to get back into the car when it's moving. Really, it's that bad. But the charger almost makes it worthwhile because you can listen to the Zune pretty muchZune Car Packindefinitely. There is one caveat, or rather two. First, the 12v plug does not sit firm in the lighter socket and can break contact. Second, the coiled wire neccesitates having the Zune very close to the socket or risk having either the plug pop out of the socket or the Zune take a quick trip towards the outlet. Luckily, the plug doesn't fit firmly so the former is more common than the latter."
1,Terrible Audio Quality,"I received the Zune as a promotional gift and I have been very happy with it, however this FM transmitter that I purchased for it is terrible.It's primary function is to deliver radio signal via FM to your car stero on an unused frequency, it does have an auto seek to find an available frequency which is nice but it never delivers enough signal for my stereo to pick up decent sound.I am not expecting CD quality audio here, but it should deliver FM Broadcast quality audio at the least. In this case it isn't even close to AM broadcast quailty which is just silly. I tried putting the device in every part of my car with no real difference. I also tried every single frequency on the dial.I know this isn't a problem with my car stereo because my personal satellite radio (Pioneer Inno) has a built in FM transmitter that works perfectly well.Good Luck! Hope this helps you make your decision."
1,Garbage,"Bought it for $15 more than this at a supposedly cheaper discount store. I guess I was duped. It's junk. Have had for 6 months and nothing on it works. Replaced with a ""monster"" car charger which works great...WHEN my Zune works. That's a whole other story. Anyway..don't waste your money."
1,wasted my money,bought it cause its made by zune for zune and regret it. my friend has the belkin that hooks up directly to the headphone jack and has no problem other than changing out batts from time to time. aside from that the zune car pack has lousy transmission. i have a hard time finding a free station since the seek feature only goes to the next freq even if its used. so alot of changing stations. the best way to get static free transmission after i find a free station is by holding on to the whole player and using myself as an attenea or else i get static. all in all very disappointed with this product maybe i'll try the other one that has better reviews or i'll just go with the belkin one that i know works even though it doesn't look nice and requires batts hey but it at least lets you listen to my music comfortably...
2,Car Radio adapter for Zune,Maybe we are too new for this but the radio adapter is frequently fuzzy and there is interference. The auto tune is not usefull as it seems to select a station that has a broadcast. The charger is good and makes sense to have the ability to charge the unit while travelling.
5,Works as designed,"I have a 2004 lincoln navigator and on the first try, I was able to transmit the music from the zune through the FM station of my choice. The sound was great and the music came through clearer than most radio stations. Very pleased with this product."
1,As bad as they say it is,"Take my word for it, the FM transmitter is as bad as they say it is. Even with the mod that's well documented on the web. Even if the transmission can be improved, the transmitted sound has static and is definitely not high fidelity.The charger cord works well."
3,"Not the best product, but works",Sound quality and volume are fair but you have to switch station regularly. Not a bad choice if you don't want to put in a direct line.
1,"3 items listed, but I only get 2","I was suppose to get 3 items(Like it is on the Pic),but I get 2 items. I did not receive the usb cord."
1,Not a high quality item,"I bought the pack with my 80gb Zune. I love the Zune, I regret the FM transmiter. First, I have to take my Zune out of my leather holder so I can plug in the transmitter. The plug never really feels that secure to begin with. Second, the best audio I can get still contains about 50% static. The quality of the sound/signal seems to be dependant on the orientation of the transmitter, and I don't exactly have a lot of options as to where I can place it in my car. I take long road trips (up to 5-6 hours) almost daily for my job. I was hoping to use my Zune as my own personal radio station. Having to find a new station to tune ever 2 hours or so is very annoying and a bigger pain the trying to dial my cell phone while driving. I've given up and just use the headphones, with the car adapter plugged in for power.I highly recommend find a transmitter with a stronger signal output."
1,Dislike greatly,"This product was not what i thought it would be. There is a lot of crackling when u plug it in, and you occasionally here the radio coming through your zune instead of your downloaded music. I have another product that was way cheaper and works way better. I do not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Money to burn....,"Please do not waste your time or money on this item, unless you have money to burn. Don't get me wrong, the car charger part of the kit is great, but the modulator for radio frequency is horrible. It provides substandard sound, no matter what format you have your audio in. I tried multiple frequencies, multiple formats, and every setting on the zune itself, it's just horrible. I am returning mine ASAP. I cannot justify spending 70 bucks on such a terrible item. Hope this helps someone else."
1,DOA,"I ordered this hoping I'd finally be able to avoid listening to the radio anymore. I was wrong. After fiddling with it for nearly 2 hours, I could never get it to work. DOA."
2,Barely Works,"Well I guess this thing works, it will transmit audio through your car speakers but it is always full of static, even when I'm in the middle of nowhere. The auto-seek does not work, it will just move the station 2 clicks up at a time, definitely not a true auto-seek. You don't notice as much how choppy it sounds with music, but you will really notice it with podcasts or audiobooks; it sounds like the if you go to a clear radio station and go one click up or down so it sounds distorted. It's not so terrible that I'll throw it out the window, but it's sitting right on that edge of total garbage and kind of works. I use it in two different vehicles with the same results."
3,It works but...,"It can be either ran off the Zune battery power itself (only transmits like 2' with so so sound quality and thunderstorms interfere with it severely) Or it can run of the Av outlet (Greatly increases transmitter range but sound quality is definitely lacking). The sound quality is lacking, and higher notes in a music turns to static. Otherwise the auto channel find and everything else works flawlessly."
1,NO GOOD,"THIS PRODUCT DID NOT WORK FOR ME, I OWN AN ACURA RL 2008, ALL I GET IS INTERFERENCE,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT!"
1,Maybe it was an AM transmitter...,I'm so disappointed. I would have to mount my zune to the face of my stereo for this to work properly. I love my zune so much... I was really hoping I'd love this.
2,not worth the money... even if free,"I bought this on Amazon. The first one was deffective. The second one still is not great. The sound fades in and out, and does not stay tuned. I am ready to throw it away!"
3,It works OK,It works OK but I guess you get what you pay for FM transmitters. It could be my car radio also.
4,Good enough,"The gadget works, but I'm in an area where the stations aren't that available. It works much better when I'm in a larger city or on a road trip (which is exactly why I wanted it.)"
2,mediocre,"The transmitter works, but poorly, signal intensity/range is weak compared to other transmitters I've used. Also I didn't realise that with my model of zune (8gb), this transmitter does not fit flush with the sides, it sticks out about an inch from the left side of the player, which im guessing is because it was probly designed for older, larger zunes."
2,Not Satisfied At All,"I ordered this product thinking it would be awesome to be able to listen to my Zune's music in my car. But when I received this product and went to use it, I was far from satisfied. The sound was very crappy. No matter what station I put it on I would have lots of static like a radio station does when it's getting out of range. I have two 12"" subwoofers in my car and they didn't even work when I had my zune plugged in. So therefore the bass was crappy too. So over all, I wouldn't suggest buying this product but if you do, hopefully you have better luck then I did."
1,Charger makes noise. Transmitter doesn't have good range,"The car charger will make a noise from the alternator everytime you charge and listen to your device. Be advice that the FM transmiter won't cover the car area well at all. The power is very very low and you will still receive in your radio noise in the background, regardless of a free frecuency or not. Product needs to be more powerful to operate correctly. Charger needs to be better filter in order not to have noise from the alternator."
2,zune to FM channel in car,sometimes works ok but most of the time you could only hear interferences from local FM radio stations with lots of statics & noises.
1,Save your money,This item is terrible. Microsoft has yet to release a product for the car that actually works. I have tried multiple products and nothing works. DO NOT buy this item. I love my zune but the car pack works very poorly playing mostly static on all stations. You are better off to save your money.
2,"Good sounding broadcast, but not without constant tuning","I bought this FM broadcaster for my Zune so I can listen to my digital music while driving instead of having to buy an MP3 stereo system for my car. I can say that when it works (about 60% of the time), it delivers great sounding broadcast. But that does not come without doing some constant tuning, i.e. moving your Zune around for ""hot spots"" or tuning to other frequencies for better signals.Of course if you go on a roadtrip, you will definitely need to keep scanning for available frequencies as radio signals from different counties interferes with the broadcast. I am looking into the CarPlay transmitter by Monster as a possible alternative. Great music player, disappointing accessory."
2,Wish I had read the comments here first!,"I can certainly understand why the `image is not available'...this product is an embarrassment to Microsoft Zune. I unfortunately did not get it as a promotional product as some did....I have had exactly the same problems as the other consumer comments listed.First I blamed it on my car antenna being installed into the windshield..(I have a Scion XB) but ruled that out.I love using my Zune in the home and at the gym, and was so excited by the possiblity of listening to it in my car.This is the 2nd car unit I have purchased--I gave away my Monster unit with hopes that this one would be better.....Do not waste your money!I have learned that reading the Amazon reviews is a great soundboard of information."
1,Expensive Garbage,This product is worthless. No matter where I put it in the car the signal is horrible.
1,Waste of $80,I bought this product a week after I got my Zune and was too impatient to read customer reviews or wait for a third-party solution.The car adapter stopped working after a month.The FM transmitter never worked. I constantly got static through all my songs. Reception is completely dependent on weather and terrain.Zune customer support sent me a second transmitter when I complained it works just as poorly.Don't buy this unless you can put your Zune at least one foot from your car antenna.
2,Not to great,"As the others have stated the transmitter is poor I have had almost no luck in finding a working frequency I have tried it in 2 Cadillacs, BMW and a Jetta and still have the same problem with static."
3,"Not the worst, but definitely not the best","I bought this after recieveing a free Zune from a sweepstakes. I am still considering returning this piece of junk. It took me 3 hours into the car ride to finally get a good sound of this thing. Plugging the Zune/transmitter hybrid into the ac adapter was definitely not an option because the only way I could get a decent sound was if i threw the thing in the back seat of my Civic. Once I did that the sound was great almost CD quality however, if I wanted to skip a song it required me to reach into the back seat to retreive the device which is definitely not an option while drving at 70 mph on the freeway. There has got to be a better option."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!,I dont know what Microsoft was thinking when they released this. It sounds terrible in the car. My ipod transmitter sounds perfect and this sounds the junk. You think for as much money as microsoft makes they could come up with somthing better. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
2,Waiting to get the monster version,"I got this after winning the Zune in a promo from Microsoft. The Zune is great, but I have encounter the same problems as others.. For one, positioning is everything, I have to rest mine under my dash near my gear stick to get a clear signal. Two, the charger has to be plugged into too to get a very clear signal - totally [..] for me. Three - the sound quality just isnt that good. I don't aspect CD quality like someone said, but to be that close to your antenna and have it sound muffle is crazy. I'm going to purchase the monster version, I was orginally but they didnt have it in stock. Monster is kown for good audio products and I'm guessing it will out perform this ok, but very unsatifactorty product"
5,What a bargain,"I ordered this for my zune player and I love it. The only thing is every now and again you get static on a channel, I live in a large city- but the search on this allows you to find the next availble channel. I have not listened to the radio, since I have this in my car now!"
2,OK,This is ok. But it fades in and out as i'm driving. I'm not sure if it's my radio or transmitter that is makung my music sound like sHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
3,Gets the Job Done,"It works and get's the job done but kills the battery far to fast (between 2 and 3 hours of use before the zune battery is dead). Also, when you go under a traffic light the static overtakes the music so you can't hear it. Which makes local commuting a pain, highway travel is fine and static free for the most part."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in the quality. It cuts in and out and does not stay connected very well to my zune. Very poor reception and I don't see myself going out of my way to use it.
1,Made the mistake of buying this..will return,This has to be the worst Microsoft made piece of hardware I've used in recent memory. The tuner keeps going in and out as the weakest stations mess with the signal. I've used the IPOD Belkin RF transmitter with good results and this product is NOWHERE near the quality of that. I will now go with the Belkin product and hope that it works better.Buyer beware...this product doesn't work as advertised.
1,FM Transmitter is garbage,"As everyone else has said, the charger works fine, but the FM transmitter is worthless. You'd think Microsoft would have put at least *some* effort into making their Zune accessories since they're trying so hard to keep up with iPod's market. But apparently they grossly overlooked this particular item, because it simply doesn't work.Save yourself the money and sanity, and don't purchase this kit, even if it seems to be the only Zune-compatible car kit on the market."
1,Does not work very well,"This unit no better than any of the other units on the market to use this technology. While it may be acceptable in a small area, any amount of travel usually involves getting interference from some radio station and requiring resetting the stations or just giving up. I quit using the unit after a month of trials"
2,Too much bandwith/channel interference in my area.,"That's probably why this set was $5. If you live in an area where there are lots of stations, as I do, you won't be able to find a frequency this will transmit on cleanly. Plus, you really have to crank your volume up on your Zune and your radio. I recommend buying another car with the mp3 player built into the radio - ha!"
4,Great car kit,"This Zune car kit works great. It has a long cord, so that your player doesnt have to hang down while plugged in. :)"
2,Review of Zune Car Pack,"I am disappointed in the Zune Car Pack. Although the Car Pack appears to be well made, it fails to produce a strong enough signal to be useful for transmitting audio from the Zune to the car radio antenna. The audio is distorted and includes considerable interference, regardless of where it is placed in the car. I love the Zune, but consider my purchase of the Zune Car Pack to be a mistake.Thank you"
1,I cant believe they would mass produce something like this,"I bought one and then returned it because Its just hard for me to believe that microsoft would produce and sell something of this quality. I had an ipod with an fm transmitter which worked great in my car. I couldn't get this to work near what the ipod did. Like the zune, not the accessories."
1,DO NOT spend $86.00 on this thing,"I bought a brown zune a few days ago and it's worked great, I love it. Now pretty much everyone one of my friends has an iPod, 30gb, 80gb, nano, shuffle, whatever.. and most of them have one of the FM transmitters put out by iPod or by Belkin, or Griffin, or whatever other companies, and they look and work great! But when I bought this one for my Zune, I tried it out right when i got in my car, and I couldnt get it to sound good without static..! I tried everything, and I just got so frustrated I ended up turning my car around, driving back and returning it to get my 86 bucks back.. I was so disappointed. I was looking forward to listening to my zune in the car with this great looking accessory, but it was horrible.. not just bad, horrible. Don't buy it!!"
1,Warning: Do Not Buy. Honestly!!!!!,"I live in South Dakota where radio interference is not a problem at all and still this thing was terrible. Not bad, terrible. I bought this, and a Zune together and took both of them back. This project would not work like it should. You could hear the music, put w/ static! Not just a little static either, a lot. Tried this project in two Cars and on my Sony reciever in my house. Sucked on all three. So, go out and buy a third party FM Transmitter over this thing. I seriously wouldn't buy this thing for $5 bucks....I can't believe M$ would but there name on such a terrible project so early in trying to get into the MP3 business..Wow...."
1,"Buy it if you like Static, Return it to get your money back!","I have a 30gb ipod with fm transmitter and it works great. I bought the Zune and the Car Pack FM Transmitter. I bought the Zune to use in my car, but can't because the FM Transmitter sucks. In order for it to work, I have to position it in my hand and wave it around in the air to the ""perfect"" spot, but then of course I can't drive at the same time. So, because the FM Transmitter did not work, I had to return the FM Transmitter Car Pack plus the Zune.Zune got my hopes up for something better than the iPod but let me down over an accessory that Microsoft should have been able to master with their $$Billions in annuals sales - but I guess not after all.."
1,Don't waste your time,I purchased this yesterday. After only using it for 30 minutes I have decided to take it back.1. It will stay attached to my Zune.2. It has too much static.3. When there is little static the sound is not clear.
1,A Huge Disappointment,"For me, I wanted ways to fight the bullying, too powerful ways of the IRS, not to make buddies with them and spend more time and effort trying to please them. The IRS has for way too many years gone above and beyond, even our judicial systems legal authority, to purposely put more and more people in bondage and fear. They need to be dealt with, not pampered. For those who choose to let the IRS continue to rob the American people and try to be most cooperative with them, I would guess this may be the book you are looking for. Unfortunately it was a waste of the little money I have, as the IRS is taking nearly $300 a month from my Soc Sec disability checks & my power has been turned off twice due to the fact that I cannot make it with them taking this kind of money. Also can no longer properly afford my prescriptions. Letters to them are pretty much ignored. If you cannot afford a lawyer-they do whatever they want to to you."
1,this stuff is so cheesy you could make pizza with it,"I absolutely LOVED Information Society when I was, oh, 14 or so. Along with Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Lords of Acid, and T99, they were one of the main groups that got me into electronic music.However, I'm not 14 any more, and the music on this CD makes me cringe now. It's 80s pop music, and it's BAD 80s pop music. If it weren't for the nostalgic value, I'm quite sure it would be unlistenable. In fact, I think it might be unlistenable even WITH the nostalgic value."
3,A mediocre album,"I reiterate the comments from a post near the bottom of this page that most of the songs are 'gimmicky,' although, still nice and flavorful. Not a great CD, nor a bad one, just an average one."
4,Enjoyable pop tart.,"""Pure Energy"" and ""Walking Away"" remain the standouts on this promising debut by Information Society. The former remains one of the staples of dance music, a sort of updating of 1970's disco with an 80's sensability and wicked beat. An enjoyable album-although a newbie might consider getting the best of the band on one compilation-or perhaps making their own from the band's catalogue."
1,Amazon.com screwed up!!!,"I wish I could rate this product but Amazon.com screwed up when listing it on their website. I ordered 2 Phoenix Gold RSD250.2s but received 2 HDMI cables instead. The vendor, Datavision is suppose to send a full refund. I sent a couple e-mails to Amazon to see if they would somehow honor their advertised price but I have yet to get a response... go figure.Based on my previous experiences with Phoenix Gold car audio this amp would have been awesome. The RSD line of products is unbelievable. I wish Amazon hadn't have dropped the ball on my order."
4,Excellent Book,"This book really explains in detail what exactly is going on in the mind of someone who is a pathological liar. I've always thought that this ""condition"" wasn't true. I've been skeptic into believing that someone who constantly lies may have a mental problem. This book really opened my eyes. The book is small, but the book is definately worth the read. The author writes as if he's speaking directly to you."
5,Like a cool breeze in the desert,"It is so thrilling to have new Chameleons to listen to. There is no band that touched my heart and soul during the darkest hours of a turbulent youth like these boys did. And this album is not only excellent on its own merits, but the signiture sounds of the echoing guitar and Mark's unmistakable vocals bring back memories associated with so many of their other classic songs. This is a treat for the fans!"
5,Let's Call It Brilliant!,"I won't take up much space here,as its my first Amazon review.If you're a fan of intelligent Brit-Pop/Rock and enjoy being carried away by gorgeous,beguiling,rousing,poignant waves of lyric and melody then buy this CD.It's finally available in the U.S. on Cleopatra records."
3,Time and Place,"I'm not sure if it's because I'm not sixteen anymore, or because of high expectations, but after a spin I'm a bit disappointed in the Chameleons' new release. I hope my opinion will improve over repeated listenings, and would love to hear these songs played live.While there are some good tracks (Indiana, All Around), the record as a whole seems a bit rushed. There are jagged edges in the songwriting and inflection, and some of the characteristic guitar jangles seem a bit forced. I hope the Chameleons will stay together (and tour the US!) and have a little more patience with their next release."
1,Don't buy this CD,"I love the Chameleons and listened to them in college when they first started playing. I had their first three vinyl albums. I bought this album in CD format hoping for one more taste of their excellent sound. This album is very disappointing and as a regular rock album probably rates a C-, but as a Chameleons album, it is an F.Bottom line, don't waste your money on this CD. Don't even put it in your collection. It is embarrassingly bad and I will never listen to it again. Anybody want a cheap CD?"
5,Fine historical work,Dr. Owsley tells the story of the Gulf area during the War of 1812 in a very readable manner. His work is quite thorough and includes a lot of detail about the skirmishes and battles. I recommend this to anyone with an interest in the War of 1812 and the Creek Indian War. The research done was well documented and any student of history will find this a great source.
3,For 3 years old kids and below.,"This figures do not stand still, they are about 4 inches long. quality is not bad, they will not break easily, however my kid which is 5 years old didn't liked it very much :)"
1,piggy not as expected,I bought this item and received it in bad shape. I had to repair it because i needed it for a party. i was very disappointed. I hid the broken piece by using ribbons to cover it. I had to glue the jewel back on.
5,Very pleased with product,Very pleased with product and shipping time. Would do business again with seller
3,Great sideshields for round glasses,Acquired these as I frequently have to visit factory setting where security glasses are needed. The shields are made of plastic and they will fit really well on small round glasses. If you have rectangular glasses as it popular right now the fit is less than perfect and for those you might want to consider alternatives.
5,2good2betrue,This is like the best book eva..... it has many romantic scenes and is REALLY GOOD........... ^.^(>'')> ~Dancing Kirby~
4,Still good!,"I have read the entire series to date, and while it's not the most exciting, it leaves me wanting more. But I hope that the story ends soon because I want to find out Inuyasha's wish. Human or demon?"
5,Stellar Majesty!,"This album is spell binding and totally entrancing. I would compare it to the music of Andreas Vollenweider or any of Kitaro's earlier works. Not your typical crystal bowl CD, (But then again, none of the Crystal Vibrations music is!)Elivia has captured the journey into far space and back again with this seamless and superb album. You return again, but not to exactly where you started the trip, as you're different. It's like signing on to a musical translation of what ascension is all about. Every time I listen I get new insights about myself, and my own life journey and get Lighter! If you like to relax completely and move into new dimensions, this music is a must have!"
5,Wonderful crystal bowl music!,"I LOVE singing crystal bowls and the sounds they create. Elivia has a wonderful ensemble that blends the bowls with Native American flute, didgerdoo and other instruments. This is music to meditate to and I even use it to fall asleep to at night. This is a hour's worth of blissful sound that you feel on many levels."
2,You get what you pay for,"While basically functional and lightweight, I returned this for a more sturdy tripod. Too much plastic in key components and a ""cheap"" feel to the head."
4,Get's the job done fine if you're not an avid photographer,"If you will use this thing a half dozen times a year, it'll do fine. It's not the highest quality, but it's decent. Get something more expensive if you're going to put it through a lot."
5,I can stand up to film.,"All I could find in retail stores were Tripods that would only go up to 60"". It's to low you have to keep bending over to use it, plus it's not high enough to clear over the heads of people in front of you.The price is half what I paid for at a retail store. You can't go wrong on this one!"
5,You can't beat this tripod for the price...,This tripod is light weight and very portable. It is solid and easy to use. This price is right and the quality is good.
4,Good enough for the money,"The material feels mostly plastic and I wonder about durability. It is tall enough for almost anyone, I'm 6'4"". It did not come with any instruction. And since it is my first tripod, I needed someone else to show all the movements. The movements feel jerky, and tightening the knobs would inevitably shake and change the sight picture on my scope. Nevertheless, for my purpose of using with a spotting scope, it does its job once I got the scope fixed on the target."
3,You get what you pay for,"It fell over once and broke a smal part off, wasn't high up or anything. Also, when I attached my digital camera (D90), it seemed to be almost to heavy for the tripod itself...lame."
4,Nearly Perfect for the Amateur,"Super speedy free delivery... ordered on Sunday, and it was delivered Tuesday night! Tripod seems to be a great deal for the price. Was happily surprised to find the tripod came with a decent carrying bag. I'm new to photography, and think this will be perfect for my needs. It did take me a minute to figure out how to get the camera to screw onto the piece that clamps the camera to the tripod. I didn't see any directions on how to use all the different levers in the box, however, it isn't too complicated. Am very pleased with this purchase."
4,Good tripod for the price!,"This tripod is stable and tall. It is a good tripod for not allot of money. the head is decent, with minor free play once locked down. It does not compare to high end tripods however...where the head alone can cost $80.00 so understand that you get what you are paying for. the legs are sturdy, and has a center hook for attaching a weight to make it even more stable, or as a convenient place to hang your camera bag, effectively providing the same effect.This is one of the best $25-$30 tripods, but if minor post lock down free play is a problem for you, spend the $100+ for a pro tripod."
5,"Very good product, stable and easy to use.",If you are beginning your studio or an amateur and need a low price high value for the money this is the tripod for you.The tripod is stable at all highs. If you need more stability just put the timer and wait. Is built with plastic but it looks professional and durable.This also come with a carrier bag.
5,24 dollars? ITS A STEAL !,"This tripod it the best bang for buck! I use it for my jvc camcorder to make films. If you get the right technique you can get smooth pans out of it(I did). AND DAMN ITS TALL, and strong too."
5,Impressive Tripod,"Just received my tripod, and the first thing I did was to let other family members know of it's quality and incredible value. I can't wait to use this tripod, I am already impressed with how smooth it sets up, and how effortlessly the panhead swivels. The quick release plate removes easily as well. Very pleased also with the prompt shipping of 47th Street Photo. I would recommend this Camera Tripod to anyone."
1,Thought it was good .. Doesn't Hold Up Over Time,"Bought December 20th 2007. Seemed like a decent enough tripod at the time.But now it's pretty much unusable. The gray crank wheel has broken off,so it's hard to raise and lower. Also, one of the metal supports forone leg had broken off from the center. So even though it has somesolid construction, there are indeed some weak parts, that after timeare likely to fail."
5,Great Tripod,"This tripod works great, it was a great price and came very fast, it was exactly what I wanted!"
1,look elsewhere,"This product is an example of false advertisement. I have purchased it based on their ""professional"" description, plus the illusion that it is a $69 tripod. First, after I got it, it is cheap plastic, not even worth $29 + $9 for shipping. It is definitely poorly made, and all its components seems to want to break when you just touch it. I have seen the same tripod exaclty, in circuit city under a different name for $29, with no need to pay for shipping. This is by far the worst product I have ever purchased, and they are falsly claiming to have sold this flimsy thing for $69, which is impossible. The only way they can sell it, is online, when people have not seen it. I would not have touched it, had I seen it. I got fooled by the ""professional"" and the false $69 original price claimed. Avoid this like the plage."
2,No instructions included,No instructions included. Can't bring the tripod to a 70 inch height as advertised. Don't know how to use the features without a guide.
2,Pretty disappointed.,"It's a no frills tripod and I expected that. I ordered two of them for my kids who are budding photographers. But the head on both of them is not attached perpendicular to the elevating shaft. one tripod is worse than the other. I'm not talking about one of the axis adjustments. You can see it if you set it up for level, lock it down except for panning and then pan around. You'll see the camera doesn't stay level as you turn it around. I've got an old cheap tripod that I compared these to, and it is steady all the way around.It appears they weren't very careful attaching the head to the shaft straight. Hopefully I can fix it. I don't think it's worth the shipping to send them back for warranty replacement, plus the boxes are long gone."
1,garbage,I have bought many tripods and this one is near the bottom. The thing loosens any time you pan the head. Do not buy.
3,"Great tripod, one flaw...","Great tripod. Nice quality, easy to use. I have found one flaw and I don't know if it is the tripod or just my camera. My camera lens is so heavy that if I try to take a port. picture the tripod does not hold in the correct position, it slowly falls down until the lens is looking at the floor. I'm sort of affraid that my camera will fall of one of these times. I think that if my lense wasn't so heavy there would not be any problems. Overall I love my new tripod."
4,everything I need,"Being an amateur photographer, this tripod does what i need at a cost that not hard to deal with. yes its far from a professional but for this price it works fine. I have only used it a few times and found it easy to set up and to use. I like the handle it has to carry it and with the shoe it makes it very a snap to remove my D40 nikon. Have used it primarily with my longer lens's and have had no stability problems. At 6'2'' and a sore back i didn't need to be leaning over all the time to take a picture."
3,Acceptable,"The tripod is very lightweight and works as advertised. It comes with the detachable head that more expensive kits ask you to purchase separately. It does reach the advertised 70"" height. Which is excellent for my very tall wife, but not so great very stability. We were at a crowded photo shoot and had to catch the tripod a couple of times as other folks easily knocked it over.The legs extend easily and lock with one hand.Positioning the head takes some getting used to and you have to work in two planes so panning and scanning are more difficult. It's better for panoramic shots than action shots. If you only pan in plane (football, soccer) it works fairly well. But the plastic head components aren't as smooth as a metal ball and socket.It will do until I can find a professional tripod kit.The only real failure was the tongue of the zipper on the carry bag breaking the first trip out. It still zips so..."
3,I got what I paid for,This is half plastic. Not for anything with weight. I bought it for $24 so I didn't expect much. If you want cheap here it is.
4,Excellent for the price,"See many people complaning about it's cheap plastic built, but hello? this is a 30 bucks deal, what were you expecting, titanium? This tripod is excellent for begginers who don't want to spend a lot of money (like me). Completely recommend it.PS: Just take it easy when handling it, it's just plastic hence it can easily be broken."
2,For beginners....,"I really wanted to write a good review for this item but I can not. When I received tripod I was very excited and used it for few times before we went to Grand Canyon. And then my disappointment has started.A tripod got loose after few uses, you can't screw tight the head of the tripod, so if you are using heavier camera this can be real worry. The worst thing is that the top of the tripod can't be locked once you set the target. It always moves few millimiters. If you are shooting details this is unacceptable. Another thing: it's very difficult to follow up subject without unscrewing all bolts which makes whole head of the tripod loose and until you put everything together your great pictures is gone.If you are occasional photographer and you need tripod only for Xmas to take a family picture this is a great deal for you. If you want something more.... add few more bucks and go for something better."
4,Good general use tripod is value priced,"This is a good value tripod that has many nice features on it and the price is very good. Although there is a lot of plastic on it, this does serve to reduce weight and requires some common sense in handling. It is not something you want your children to play with or climb on. Overall the fit and finish are good, and I like the ease of changing to a vertical format. The camera is easy to disconnect from the tripod and so one can screw the camera onto it while the bracket is off, and one can see what they are doing. The legs work well and the feet are stable, and there is a built in spirit level which is handy. The crank is a bit stiff when new but all the locks work well and do the job. I would recommend this tripod to people who do still photography. I might have some reservations about the smoothness of the pan and tilt for use with video applications. The 70"" max height is a very good feature."
2,"Mine was broken the first day, but it had some ""help""","Yep, broke the first day. When my back was turned my 5-year-old got a hold of it and one of the parts snapped off. It didn't render it unusable, but in the weeks since (I've had it about 6) it's becoming more flimsy by the day. I'm actually on Amazon to look into getting a better one."
2,After two months ordering still waiting for tripod,"I ordered in February 13, 2007 but I am still waiting for tripod.I sent the e-mail about this issue: no answering."
2,Not the tripod to buy...,"First off this thing weighs a ton, haven't really used it yet because in hurts my shoulder to carry. It is also huge, the tubes that make up the legs are very wide so not only can I not say fit my hand around it well folded up but it also does not fold up small... you'd have to carry the thin in a ski bag because it isn't going in your camera bag or backpack. Did I mention it weighs a ton? Also the bag it comes in is useless, zipper tab bent then broke off on the first pull so hope you have a golf bag to put this thing in, and a golf cart to carry it. I've owned several tripods and this weighs as much as all of them... for the price go to Sears and pick something at random and you will have something you will use more than this."
2,eeeeeeeeeeesh,"I give this 2 star because it's cheap and it kinda works. This Tripod is light but its cheaply made. The leg locks are made out of hard plastic, you usually find this material in products from the 99 cents store, that look like it could brake on the 3rd or 4th use. I'm surprised this tripod is not 99 cents. It is pretty cheap for the size and what it is. I recommend it for your: ""Disney Pix-Click Digital Camera""Disney - Pirates of the Caribbean Pix-Click Digital Camera"
5,"Good value for the money !! Opteka 70""",It does everything I needed. It turns every way I needed. It's not heavy and at the same time it's pretty stable and well built tripod. I would recommend it!
2,"Good as a first, but cheap.","You get what you pay for with this tripod. Ultimately I ended up upgrading because this one is made fairly cheaply, but it did the job for a little while. Not meant for heavy cameras/lenses."
3,"Not the best, but okay","I brought this tripod mainly for my T1i DSLR. The reason I brought this is because I saw all the good reviews of it. However, I might have to say it does not 100% fit your DSLR if you are using a long focus lens especially at night. Every time I tried to use my 75-300mm lens to capture something dark at night, the tripod swing a lot. Remote shutter, timer or drive mirror lockup won't help. Once I almost dropped my camera because the vertical adjustment knob was loose no matter how hard I twisted it.The materiel is not the good either. It is heaver than I expected but more fragile in small parts than my last tripod. I suspect they used a lot of cheap heavy plastic to fill in the parts instead of metals.In general, it is okay for this price, but don't expect too much if you are holding a DSLR and trying to capture something long distance at night."
4,GREAT BUY!,This was a Christmas gift for my son. He had picked it out but I really thought it would not be what he wanted since it was priced so reasonable. But it was perfect. Actually looked much more expensive than what we paid for it. Very pleased.
4,Opteka tripod,Good quality for the price. I don't have to bend over when I'm standing to use this tripod. I like it very much.
4,great,"a bit heavy and bulky to transport, around 4lb but if you want a real tripod this is it!!!Only thing i don't like is the handle for rotating the head but i can totally live with it for 25 bucksit will hold at least 20lb if not 30"
4,"Opteka 70"" tripod","This product is good. I wouldn't say it is sturdy, but it is not flimsy either. It is a good value for the price. Largely the tripod is made of plastic. It will not take rough treatment. Just be careful with its handling, and it will be fine."
3,Good cost benefict,"It is not as solid as the images.I would prefer if they don't use the word ""professional"" for the product (wich is not).But it worth's the price."
5,Awesome tripod,It is very good for an amateur photographers. It is little heavy but certainly worth the buy. It holds the camera very firmly. Not flimsy. It holds the weight of the camera very well. Not like some other tripods. Very easy to carry. Overall a very good buy.
3,Not for Video,"Well i bought this because it was cheap and i needed somthing to hold my video camera, while it works great for interviews, anytype of movement is noticable and is unfluid. Since the product description says Photo / Video Tripod its only kinda good. Perfect for photos, bad for video!!"
1,"Opteka 70""","I was very happy with the Opteka 70"" tripod. It was everything it was advertised to be. I did research before purchasing and the reviews pointed to this product to be the best for my needs. It arrived in a timely manner. The cost of this Opteka 70"" tripod was reasonable. I recommend purchasing through Amazon. This company has always been good to deal with."
4,Okay - 3/4 torque through 1/2 drive.,"I got this to go on the 3/4 output on my torque mutiplier.Time will tell how it holds up as 3/4 drive will put out a lot more torque than 1/2 can handle so you could break nuts, sockets or even the adaptor, just be gentle.This is an odd size to find as most people already have 1/2 drive."
2,mastered from vinyl!!!! A real downer to a great series.,"I bought this, my first volume of the hed kandi series, and while I'm thrilled to have the full length 12"" mixes of many of these classics on CD, I can't overlook the fact that you can HEAR pops in the vinyl records that many of these songs were obviously mastered from for this compilation. Listen to this CD through headphones and you'll notice it much more at certain points. While it isn't the worst thing and it sounds like effort was made to clean up the sound quality, it makes me hesitant to buy another volume of this series. Why spend so much money for CD quality when all you're getting is vinyl quality recorded onto CD??? I could do that at home with my recordable CD player and my turntable..."
1,Don't Buy!!!!,"I picked this up at a used CD shop and no wonder the person got rid of it! I am a huge Hed Kandi fan (they've saved my life musically). But I have to be frank, this really, really, really is an awful compilation. Out of the 24 tracks on this double CD compilation I only enjoyed 3 songs. Those are ""Respect"" by Adeva, ""Passion of your passion "" by Gat Decor and ""Whatcha Gonna Do with my Lovin"" by Inner City. The rest of the songs are simply R&B tracks from the late 80's early 90's (a period I loathed). Hed Kandi is a great lable but they have so much better compilations out there. Skip this one."
5,Great!,"This book is amazing! I am a student finishing up my master's thesis and I just fell in love with this book. Not only does it have a really great section on the motor speech process, but it also has chapters dedicated to the speech subsystems and treatments to address the individual subsystems. Great Buy!"
3,"She's okay, but she has some issues","I have this Ashley doll. After about a year or six months, her arm fell off where it bends at the elbow! Now bother her arms keep falling off! The strap on the helmet broke, too. I called the Breyer place, and they sent me a new one, but the strap on HER helmet broke, too! Oh, well, I still play with her.-Happy and disappointed doll owner"
2,Not the same as the picture,I love breyer but this was a disappointment.in the picture Ashley has freckles but the doll does not and the picture also has bows in her hair it was. Just hair. And the doll even had bangs. The picture is off
3,"Breyer understands horses, not people","I'm an adult collector, with the result that I am both more forgiving of some of the doll's shortcomings, and less forgiving about others. First, the doll really is poseable on the horse, with a little persistance. Second, I don't find her breakable with gentle use. Third, she's sort of cute. Fourth, she is correctly scaled for traditional Breyer horses. Now for the bad, at least in my opinion. First, is anybody else bothered that her sweet little face is clearly that of an eight-to-ten year-old, yet she has a full bosom? Ick. Second, Breyer doesn't seem to understand that you can convey joyful innocence without painting eyebrows that are ridiculously far above her eyes. It isn't a ""natural"" sweet expression at all. And third, are you kidding me about natural-looking hair? She has clunky, huge, out-of-scale braids which also have the feature of looking like Pippi Longstocking's hair. Breyer does not understand human realism, only equine realism."
3,to fancy?,"even though i dont own this toy it is very cute, but i think it is to fancy I mean, look at that hat. pink lepord? i like it but i think it is to fancy"
1,I don't like it.,"I don't think It even deserves one Star but that is the minimum it will allow me to go. THe way it is to me, he says that teengers shouldn't have relationships. That's not true. Teenagers need those relationships for their future. THey learn to find the one God has for them now when they need to learn it. It will save them the pain and agony of being confused later. Don't think that I don't belive in God ruling in a relationship, I just don't belive the way Mr. Harris does. My grilfriend and I read it together and found it to be a load of crock that niether of use agreed with entirly. Every once in a great while he would make a good piont but that's it. Thank you.Ash"
4,Helpful,"I loved reading this book. It was really helpful in helping me decide what boundaries I should set for a relationship. Josh wrote it in a way that wasn't too confusing and it really got through to me. I know that the idea of waiting until marriage to have sex is strange and stupid to some people , but Josh gave really good arguements for it. I would totally recommend this book to anyone who's just looking for some advice on dating in a way that'll make God proud. It's awesome."
5,A must read for love sick christian teens!!!!,I read this book after it was given to me for christmas. I have never been so inspired!!! It made me step back and take a look at my walk with God and my emotions. I was touched and changed after reading this book.
1,Lessons I learned,"I actually rated this as 1 star to get your attention. I think that the big thing for me was the fact that I had never questioned dating v. spirituality. In developing a relationship with God, this book, along with the bible, mere christianity, and the bible have most influenced me. One of the biggest disturbances between man and God is man. Namely, relationships. Now, I am not saying relationships are bad, but I was very awakened to know that God should be put at the center of them. Indeed."
2,"hilarious homo-erotic text on how to ""love"" Jesus","I didn't read this book with any high expectations. I found the topic intriguing and figured I'd see what it was about. What turns up is a joyously hysterical book of nonesense, damning people who choose to date seriously, giving no honest reason within its context to ever meet a mate and settle down and marry and basically tells you all you need for companionship is The Lord. I won't criticize this concept, although it would be easy. It then goes into basically homo-erotic subtext explaining why God is the greatest lover until you can either laugh at the absurdity (as I did) or be repelled by the uncomfortable silliness of this obsessive rant. A despicable book. Not one star because I laughed and I laughed and I laughed and I laughed."
2,Not realistic!,"I dont believe this book is very realistic or pratical. For some that are sheltered and have a good life going for them. For those that have found the one just like Mr. Harris did in his new book (kinda shady). One minute he is bashing dating and look he is now married ladies and gentlemen! Give me someone who is has been screwed over doing it the right way! Mr. Harris is inexperienced and has no credibility. The author has many good points, but ones that do not stand up against eaxh individual situation with each individual's unique lives."
1,one man's ideology made into the theology of all,"Unfortunately, the churches of today are taking these contents and calling it ""God"". What they have done is called ""DENIAL"" and ""REPRESSION OF FEELINGS"". As a single Christian, I am disgusted with the extremes this book manifests that dating is taboo. What's next, the dowry system?"
1,No bang for your buck,A bad book from cover to cover. Dating is not harmfull to my health. Im waiting for a message from the surgeon General as to wheather or not it is. I respect his opinion but I am not a player and am only interested in a veryu serious and committed relationship. I wonder how he feels about that? He is so anti-dating and anti-relationship that its a real shame. Just because he had some bad experiences does not mean I will. If this book was not a birthday present I'd be demanding my miney back right now.
5,The Guidebook to Keeping Your Love Life in the Will of God.,"Joshua Harris scored a home run on this one! I've been there, done that.. Take my word for it, don't go any further in your relationship until you read this book!!"
4,Good Help,"This book help's you realize that you shouldn't just be dating to find your mate, but use God's input when choosing a mate. A great book for Chrisitan teenagers, along with older people."
5,Fact or Not a Great Book,Not every book must be totally fact. A book is allowed to be opinion. That is the power of free speech. Although this book may not be fact based it relived a big weight off my shoulders. I now feel as though I can go on through life with a new self confidence. Thank you Mr. Harris!
4,Every teenager must read this before they start dating!,God totally spoke to me while I read this book. If you want God to reveal His true plan for you then read this!!!!
5,Courtship and not Dating.,"I read this book at a point in time when I wanted answers to how God would have us as young people to relate to one another when it comes to the opposite sex. I Kissed Dating Goodbye, helped me see the other side that many of us do not see when we see that boy and girl, holding hands and looking like the perfect couple as they date one another. The book confirmed what God have been saying to me about how I should look at a my christian Lady friends (whom I call Sisters), as a way by which God will show me what a Godly lady looks like, so that when I am ready for marriage I will be able to easily identify the Bone of my Bone, flesh of my flesh."
2,Extremist and sad,"Having just broken up with my girlfriend, I read this book to sort of ease the pain and find a new philosophy on life. Little did I now the extreme ends that Joshua Harris would take. His simple points are great and then he goes too far in his explanations. Stories and examples that are used sound made up or doctered to show his point. He neither has creditionals nor schooling for this sort of writing. Where is the proof scientifically? He sounds like Freud in his unscientific method of reasoning. It scares me how many people have taken this book as next to the Bible in holiness. Expierance is the greatest teacher. I give it to stars for the points and only two stars because of his explanations."
5,"Buy it, read it, give it to a friend!","This book would have totally revolutionised my entire attitude to dating... had I not already met the woman of my dreams! I am giving this book to all single Christian teenage relatives I have. Had I read this 10 years ago, I think I would have spared myself (and countless women ;-) ) much agony of soul!"
4,Kissing somthing good-bye never felt so good!,"I Kissed Dating Good-bye ....YOU WHAT! I have heard that over and over ! This book written by Joshua Harris has taken this society by storm. This book is full of words of wisdom, stories and new ideas. Joshua has a great style of writing. His ideas have challenged youth (even a few adults) to treat one another with complete purity. This is a wonderful gift to any young person who is just starting to see what these whole male-female relationships are all about. I read this book at age 20. I wish I had read it 7 years before that. Give Joshua a chance to speak to you about what has been laid on his heart. My hopes are that this book would speak to you like it spoke to me."
1,"I don't endorse book burning, but I'll make an exception","I'm suprised to see so many positive reviews on this book, because it has got to be the single worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read. The author's approach doesn't work because to go his route means that you must deny yourself the EXPERIENCE of dating. You can't expect to marry the first person you date. Dating gives you an opportunity to learn about the social aspects of life. What you learn from one relationship, you apply to the next. And eventually you will have grown enough to commit to a true relationship.It's so easy to jump onto Harris' hype driven God-Train and mentally fall into line with what he says. But the reality of dating is much different and much more complex in practice than Harris would like you to believe.I advise everyone to avoid reading this holier-than-thou publication. This tripe isn't worth the paper it is printed on."
5,Great advise!,"I haven't fully finshed the book yet, but so far I love his book. I think if more people followed these guidelines, there would be less divorce. I am a 33 year old divorced mother who hated being back out in the dating world. I am glad to have read this. It helps being single (again) not so bad! It also helps me not make the same mistakes I made when I was younger. If only I had a book like this back then. Thank you Joshua!"
4,Great Insight,"I think it is an amazing insight into dating in our culture. The book isn't as much about not dating as it is about realizing the opportunity you have as a single person to work for God. The book is a good starting point for a single believer as long as it is kept in the context of developing a Christ-focused life. Challenge your beliefs about dating, it will be worth it. It's full of practical, Biblical advice on how to balance emotion with commitment."
2,Not So In Good Condition,The condition of the book was not as good as it was described. There were highlights in the book not mentioned.
2,"Yeah, even he later admits he took things a bit far.....","Joshua Harris took things a bit far. He even goes on to admit this in his later books, written after he got married. Not a ""bad"" book, but one that can send people to a far side of the spectrum that Christ did not necessarily intend for us. (This is coming from a guy who is 22 and hasn't kissed a girl in two years purposefully and thinks courtship is fine, but is no more biblical than dating. The intentions in relationships, the clear expression of those intentions, and the following of behavior in line with those intentions (assuming they are godly intentions) are what is important. So guard your heart, but don't lock it in a box and hide it from the world."
2,unrealistic,"I thought this book had very good points and morals. Joshua Harris had very good guide lines for dating within a christian stand point. The points of resisting sexual temptations are good but wont apply to everyone. Most of these guide lines are unrealistic, because society today does not really think that far into dating. I think Joshua wrote these things and believes this way because he had bad experiencdes in relationships. You can date someone and still stay within christian morals. The answer is not to just stop it all together. If you cant resist the temptations of dating then you wont be able to resist anything of this world. All and all I thought this book had good points but it wont apply to everyone."
5,"Did Josh Harris write this, or did I?","I think that I easily could have written this book, as I have done many of the same things and reached many of the same conclusions as Joshua Harris did. However, I didn't write it, and in reading it, I came to a realization of the gut conclusions that I've reached over the course of my teenage and early 20's years. In a period in my life where I've begun to again contemplate serious romantic relationships, this book reminded me why I've shied away from them before, and steeled my resolve to remain God-focused in *all* of my relationships. A powerful, powerful book that I have a list of people to circulate it amongst!"
5,God finally answered my thoughts about dating through Joshua,"I just finished reading this book. It was probably one of the best books I have ever read dealing with this topic. I always felt weird about not wanting to date while all my friends were. They would all get hurt or hurt their partners and I never knew why they kept on putting themselves through the agony. Eventhough it was tough for the holidays (ie. valentines,) I always knew God would answer, and he did through Joshua. Now I'm waiting on him for my man, and it's pretty tough being 24yrs while most of my dear friends are getting married, but EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL in his time. That is what I'm clinging to. God has truly blessed Joshua with the gift of writing, and I am thankful for this book!!!!! I recommended to everybody. thanks Malin"
1,Legalism by any other name would smell just as bad...,"The first thing fans of this book say is ""I don't believe dating is wrong"", just as assuredly as an Amway employee begins by saying ""this is not a pyramid business"". Personally, I've seen the results of a church that by using guilt and legalism (extra-biblical rules), tried to construct a social norm of not dating until one was financially in a position to marry, and certainly no dating until one was 20. The result was a group of kids that had set up a pattern of denying their emotions, and had no experience base. This was not preparedness for finding and building a lasting relationship. My wife and I dated for 5 years (starting in high school), and we have been married for 6. I'm not saying that's the pattern others should adopt, but merely that it's not impossible or even uncommon for that matter."
1,Guys beware........,"Song of Solomon - yes I Kissed Dating Goodbye - NOThe fact that this book is in so many young ladies' hands is truly scary. Guys, if your girlfriend is reading this book, go ahead and break up, its inevitable. I've learned from experience, that Mr. Harris is so brilliant and us normal guys dont compare to his outlandish thoughts."
2,Just Put off the DTR as long as possible,"After seeing the preponderence of 5 star reviews of this book, I realized that there is a great need for more objective, honest reviews of this book.Josh sets out on a noble quest: spark thinking and awareness regarding our dating relationships. They can be damaging and unhealthy. Unfortunately he uses an attention getting title and a new ""idea"" that really doesn't live up to the hype. What is Josh saying?Put off the DTR as long as possible. (the Define The Relationship talk)He DOES advocate dating, he just redefines it a bit so that he can use his snappy title. He DOESN'T have anything new to say.Though he says good things, he's really just pretending to say something different. Read Elizabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity First. Josh isn't worth your time."
3,"I Kissed ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"" Goodbye","There are lots of good reasons to read this book, but don't expect a mature, well thought out Christian viewpoint to emerge. Josh Harris relies mainly on anecdotal evidence (John and Suzy started dating, John and Suzy had sex, therefore don't date) and leaves much to be desired. I appreciate his urge for caution and abstinence, but overall there are far better books on Christian dating."
3,"Brought up good, points but totally off base!","This book did have some good ideas. People should know the farthest they will go on a date before the actual event. The author thinks that every person shouldn't date unless they are almost engaged. I disagree with him on that point. The book should have been more about how to choose a good person to date, seek God's will, and then try at a relationship. Instead this book goes off on how dating will harm your life and relationship with God and others. Dating was created by God and HE needs to be kept in mind when in a relationship. The author of this book should not be the judge on your relationships, but GOD'S Will should be sekked."
5,Joshua shows how awsome it is to be SINGLE!!! :o),"When I first picked up the book, I thought that it would be about how dating is a sin. Actually it revaled to me more about how dumb I was about how I treated dating as a ""find the mate"" game. I never knew that we were just trying to speed up God's perfect timing. It's worth waiting on the Lord. Believe it or not! I will be serving the Lord during this season of singleness,until He shows me who He has created just for me. I'll still keep serving Him though, He is THE LORD! Oh yeah, you'll be surprised when you find out who wrote the forward! Keep seeking the Lord and you'll know that HIS plan is better than ours!! You're in my prayers, Josh. Keep seeking His face. :o) SMILE EVERYONE!!! GOD LOVES YOU!!!! :o) :o) :o)"
3,I Kissed Dating Goodbye,"All throughout Joshua Harris' ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye,"" he explains his point of view about dating, relationships, and sex. I agree about his view of sex which is waiting until one is married but his points about dating and relationships seem a little harsh. He believes in no dating unitl marriage. I feel that dating helps people, including myself, find out what kind of qualities they want for their husband. If someone does not date, they will not have the advantage of testing their boundaries and staying within them. God puts tests in our lives for a reason, so that we would make the right decision. How is someone going to pass their temptation test if they do not date. I feel that Joshua's book gave me points to think about but not points that I will ever follow in my life. I would recommend this book just for knowledge and to think about someone else's opinion on a controversial issue."
3,I kissed dating goodbye,"This is not a book that i would recommend. I realize that dating and sex are very controversial issues and I respect Joshua Harris' right to express his opinion. However, I have to disagree with him. My views on pre-marital sex and the temptations involved are the same as his. But I do not believe it is wrong to casually date several different people. At this point in my life I know that I do not have the time or the maturity to handle a serious relationship with one guy, so I find nothing wrong with just going out on dates. I can see Joshua's side and I realize that this method and way of thinking worked for him, but I do not believe it is right for everyone, including myself."
2,"He means well, but he's pretty misguided","I read this book a few years ago, backed out of the early stages of a relationship, but shortly after got involved with a girl I've now been with for several years. His book applies to the Christian teenager who likes to jump from relationship to relationship constantly and has no serious intent in ever getting married. He comes across as being incredibly strict, which I found to be unrealistic and unnecessary. If you are finding all your dating relationships to be wastes of time, this may be for you. If not, this book will only needlessly discourage you."
2,Chances are you have already kissed dating goodbye.,"I think this book confuses dating with casual sex, settling for the wrong person, having a boyfriend for the sake of having a boyfriend, etc. If you are already dating with the intention of marriage and living a life devoted to your family and God, you have already gotten Mr. Harris' point.What I found to be the weakest point in this book was the distinction between dating and courting. Courting is encouraged, but no clear examples were given on how this differs from dating. Overall I don't think this book told me anything I didn't already know. I think Mr. Harris could have used some stronger examples to back up his points, or better yet changed the title to ""I Kissed Casual Friendships Goodbye.""In any case I did finish this book to the end and did not find it boring. Maybe a little laughable at times, but it did make me think. It made me think how I would have written it! I am honestly suprised by all of the stellar reviews this book has gotten."
3,Good for highschoolers,"Joshua's book is filled with stories and a feel good type of attitude. He's not too Biblical.. of course he throws in a few verses here and there, but most of his lessons come from his own personal experience... which can be flawed and isn't the same for everyone.I suggest you go read Douglas Wilson's ""Her Hand In Marriage."" It is much more biblical and comes from a much more mature man."
1,Harris presents destructive ideas,"Joshua Harris is an [...] man. He has ingrained into the heads of Christian teenages that dating is an inherently bad thing, which it is not. I'm currently having problems entering into any relationship because of the type of ideas that Harris promotes. Dating *CAN* be a good thing. It is like many other things in this world--when done according to God's plan, it can be a very good, healthy and growthful thing; but when done poorly, it can be destructive. But dating itself is *not* inherently bad. Harris' ideas leave Christian teens frustrated with having interest in people of the opposite sex and not being able to act on them because they have been made to believe that it would be sinful to do so.For a better Christian perspective on dating, check out Boundaries in Dating by Dr. Cloud and Townsend."
1,"Too Righteous, Too Bad","""Do not be too righteous, and do not act too wise; why should you destroy yourself? Do not be too wicked, and do not be a fool; why should you die before your time? It is good that you should take hold of the one, without letting go of the other; for the one who fears God shall succeed with both"" (Ecclesiastes 7:16-18)."
1,Weird....,"I've read reviews that reflect the ""now I can never get hurt again"" nature to the ""this is the only way to date without being a dirty sinner"" approach. I think it's all overrated. Sure, I've been hurt. However, if I guard my heart from everyone, I may miss the person God wants me to be with. I don't think of myself as God's string puppet. God teaches me, and I make choices. If I sit around like a jelly fish for the rest of my life, I don't believe that God will simply throw all the right things into my lap. That's not a Christian walk. That's a vegetative state. In short, since the ratings only went from 1-5... I regret the fact that I was unable to rate this book a ZERO."
5,This book completely altered my view on dating.,"""I Kissed Dating Good-bye"" prepared my heart for courtship in my life. It has helped me in sharing my believes and feelings with youth."
4,A good book that takes an honest look into romance.,"Josh Harris puts together two things commonly not associated: God's will for romance in the Bible, and modern dating. Josh's insight and observations are a must for anyone interested in a healthy relationship."
4,a must read for any Christian interested in safe dating tips,"This book makes one stop and think about where they stand in God's eyes when it comes to dating. One begins to see the truth in it, and in essence, may have a very happy marriage. a definate 4 star rating"
5,"Great book, especially for youth","I think this is a great book, especially for young people who think getting into serious dating relationships is a way to act ""grown up."" I see so many high schoolers who get very emotionally involved with other teens, just to end up heart broken when it doesn't work out. This books focuses on keeping your relationship with God foremost, and trusting Him to guide your love life. I am currently about half way through leading a study group at my church based on this book, and it has really made an impact on the members of the group."
5,That book Joshua wrote really made me think twice.,"Joshua has a talent for writing. He makes you think twice about dating no matter what age you are. I really think people young or old should read it. Joshua proves a point and states it really clear. I am glad I read that book. I have read it so many times that I can recite the certain parts that I liked. My favorite part is when this girl has a dream that she is getting married and her husband to be goes to make his vows and all these girls stand up and stand single file linking arm to arm to the young man. "" Then the guy says,"" I am sorry that it had to be this way you see these are the girls i have given my heart to, and you get the rest."" It makes you wonder: ""Is that how my future love will be like?"""
5,Best Book Ever,"This is the best book I've ever read. It really opened my eyes to the world of dating. I just entered my first relationship and it helped my realize a lot of things about our relationship before I did something I'd regret. I recommend this book to anyone who's confused about a relationship, or feeling down or frustrated cause they arent in a relationship right now. I have to admit I personally dont agree with the concept of not dating until marriage, but I got a lot of other good points out of this book. As well as improving my outlook on love, this book helped me to become a better Christian!!! Go read it!!!!!!!!"
1,Thanks for screwing me over,"well i read this book back in the summer after my ex girlfriend dumped me because of.....i would just like to say that this book is very bad in that it contradicts itself throughout.You have the right to an opinion yes but i think that the way that josh(the relationship destroyer)harris presented it was completely wrong and ment to hurt more than to heal. From what i gathered from it, i was belittled, disturbed,and outright pissed off because of how i felt from its words.. Basically this book states that dating as a young person is wrong and harmful for your health, but i think its the other way around but i guess that joshua(the explayer that got caught) harris had a bad experience while with a girl and ruined it for the rest of us that are attracted to christian women.....sorry that you messed up...i guess you got your way though, congrats she's all yours now"
2,A Book of Lies,"I do not believe that Christians should only date Christians, that would be inbreeding! I don't agree with most of his ideas; they seem too bigoted and supremist. And I think that that is wrong. God would not want you to shun other people b/c they aren't Christian."
2,I think this book ruined my life...,"I read this in high school, and it led me to believe dating is bad, or ungodly, or useless. It only fueled the issues I had with being anti-social. The word ""courtship"" grates my nerves like claws on a chalkboard. I come from a homeschool family with VERY conservative Christian roots, and this guy seems to think we should live like it's the 16th century.I am a Christian, and there are a lot of things I agree with: like I don't believe in being careless with your body or your emotions towards people. However, we can have life-giving relationships with people of the opposite sex without going through the awkward ritual of ""courtship."" *shudder* I just think he takes things too far.If you're looking for a good book on this subject, this one has an accurate view of ""real life"": Uncensored--Dating, Relationship, and Sex by Jeanne Mayo. It encourages people to get outside of themselves and make some FRIENDS -- wow! whodathunkit? Not Joshua Harris. ;)"
2,"I kissed ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"" goodbye","Josh's premise is that dating among Christians can lead to all sorts of problems and even sexual immorality, therefore we should look for alternatives to dating. While he makes some valid points, ultimately Josh's argument is pretty shallow. The answer is responsible dating, not to give up dating altogether.After all, driving a car can lead to accidents, high expenses, isolation, and even death. Should we stop driving then? No, we should drive carefully.Overall, this is an immature book written by a 20 year old, and I wish he'd waited another 10 years before writing it."
1,Preach it!,"I was able to stomach this book after the second or third read. I still think Harris is much too preachy in this book. I Kissed Dating Goodbye reads like a sermon preached by a not-so-humble preacher. Harris' second book, Boy Meets Girl, is much more...down-to-earth.As a much better alternative to IKDG, I highly recommend When God Writes Your Love Story and (my personal favorite) When Dreams Come True."
1,"Good principles, bad conlusion","What Mr. Harris has done is try to speak something as diverse as dating into his own convinent little box. While his basic message of purity is right on the mark, he has drawn the conclusion that dating someone without the possiblilty of marriage inevitably leads to impurities. Mr. Harris writes with the assumption that everyone dates for impure and selfish reasons. While the faults of this book are diffucult to put into words, they will become plainly evident once you read it."
1,okay,"Dating and courting isn't it all one in the same? Seriously. Its the same thing just different words are used, JH acts like courting is more righteous than dating. There are good and bad ways to go about it.First of all I don't think that dating is a sin, in fact I think Harris has confused a lot of young people thinking that its dirty and bad. It isn't. I think Harris is focusing on the dirty side of dating and is overreacting.There are some good points that make sense and I'd reccomend it to preteens and teens but that's about it, its pretty limited for adults to read.I think that there are better books out there for teens to read on dating. I liked ""Quest for Love by Elisabeth Elliot and When God Writes Your Love Story by Eric and Leslie Ludy."" They seem more reasonable.I also liked ""I gave dating a chance by Jeremy Clark."""
1,This book completly ruined my relationship,"I was forced into reading this book, after my girlfriend of 10 months had read it. Now, up until that point we did not have much problems, but as soon as this book came into our lives it tore us apart at the seems. It seemed that we were FORCED into believing this stuff. Joshua had a way of taking what we were doing together and make it seem wrong, or bad somehow. To me as long as there is love in your life there is God."
3,"Not a Christian, but book brought up good points","I started reading this book because the author is the pastor of a friend's church and he seemed like a really nice guy when I met him (he still seems like a nice guy ^_^).Anyways, though there are some points that do seem silly to the layman, I think he also brings up some good points that apply to Christians as well as non-christians.I started reading this book as a critic, and I definitely don't agree with everything he says. But there are points about love vs. lust that I think everyone should consider before professing love for a person.Yes, I think dating is healthy during teenage years and that it doesn't seem like a good idea to start dating when you want to get married (exact opposite point of the book). But despite these differences, and despite me not being a Christian, I find myself going through the book every so often to see what Joshua Harris has to say about the problem me or one of my friends is in."
4,very helpful guidance that I have been searching for,I really enjoyed reading this book. It let me understand my feelings better. I really appreciated the examples in the book. I could better relate and see the wrongfulness that occurs when dating. I am a college student therefore it is very difficult. It is hard to deal with all that goes on here and not be a part of it. I have struggled greatly and this book helped me to put my life and values into play.
4,Business English for the 21st Century,"I had an older edition of this book, and I loved it. Unfortunately, I lost the book, and I decided to purchase a newer edition. I was disappointed to learn this edition has no answers, unlike the older edition. I would have given this book 5 stars, but I was really hoping for an answer key. Aside from that, the book has many helpful exercises and good explanations."
2,Who chose these songs?,"How could they omit ""My City Was Gone""? I won't buy it for that reason alone."
5,Welcome to the Human Race,"I bought this CD while only knowing a few of the songs on it (the ones everyone knows--Brass in Pocket, Back on the Chain Gang, and Middle of the Road), but I was pleasantly surprised to find out how many other great tracks there are on this CD. 2000 Miles is a great song, and Message of Love is one of those songs that makes you just want to go out and do something nice for someone. And most importantly, the Pretenders really know how to ROCK! It's nice that a rock band with a female lead singer (who also really ROCKS! ) has been able to stand the test of time. And this CD is a good one for people who've always liked those popular Pretenders songs, but never got around to buying any of their other CDs."
4,Don't pretend,"Good collection. Thought it would be a little better. The running combo of tracks 7-8-9 back to back makes it worth it. If not a pretenders fan, pass on this one"
4,hyde me,are you gonna ever dis the miss????????????good collection of the radio hits-----good review with some staples that will always be classic
5,Deserted Island good ...,"This is the fourth time I am buying this, the first time being on vinyl ... there is just nothing wrong with this album, and no matter what the situation you might be experiencing in your life, there is going to be a song on this album to apply to it. There is no substitute for the Pretenders, no substitute for their originality, no substitute for rock and roll. In a world of mass produced, distributed, corporate rock ... the Pretenders are TRUTH. (Insert rock and roll fingers here!!)"
5,If you want to buy just one...,"I've owned this cd forever. I'm on my 3rd copy. Has all the ""hits"" and the recording quality is good."
1,Piece of Crap,"This is one of the most poorly constructed objects I have ever purchased. It's made entirely of cheap plastic and feels like it's going to fall apart in my hands. You'll have to find someone to help you inflate things because you need at least three hands to use the pump since the hose comes apart if you don't hold it together on both ends. Imagine trying to hold the hose together in two places and pump at the same time. Add to that the additional frustration from a poor seal that allows a great deal of air to escape as you pump. I can't claim that the pump doesn't work since I was able to inflate my exercise ball. So if none of what I'm complaining about bothers you, the pump does inflate things and is rather inexpensive. But if you want a quality pump that is easy to use look elsewhere."
5,worked for me for exercise ball; very quick,"Thankfully I read the reviews before buying a new pump; I had this one already and didn't know what it was for. After reading the reviews I tried it out on my Gymnastik exercise ball, and it worked great; all inflated in 5 minutes or less."
1,not satified with this pump,I bought this pump to inflate the Theraband exercise ball that I purchased. The pump was suggested on the same page as the ball as if this was to be used to inflate. Well when I received both of these items...the pump didn't come with the correct nozzle that fit the ball's nozzle to inflate. So I had to hold and then tape in place to inflate.
5,Makes Mmmarvelous Muffins!,"When i first received this pan..i had my doubts. It sat off to the side for about 3 months and finally tonight, i decided to make some banana chocolate chip muffins and they turned out great! The crust on the outer layer was crisp! Just the way i like it. Nothing stuck to the pan, but i did butter it up. Clean up is a snap. Remember, do not wash cast iron pans with soap, just use a scrub brush and hot water. I will be purchasing more Sante Cabin cast iron!"
5,A good read,"I have read all the books up to this one and have enjoyed everyone. It is great to hear about the decendants of the family described in book one are faring. I would say that they are Christian books and the characters all find their way to God after many trials along the way. Now we are introduced to Wild Bill, Annie Oakley and also into the Gold Rush. So you can read about the history of the time as well as following the story. I will be interested to read the next book in the series."
2,thin within,This was not the book I had wanted so I was disappointed. I had wanted Thin Within by Judy Wardell
2,written in,the book came in the mail fairly quickly. i knew it was used but did not realize it would be written in.
1,"Christianity, the best diet ever.","The original edition of this book was an interesting and inspiring approach to weight management written in a direct and reader-friendly manner. This edition is an uneasy hybrid of religious proselytizing and weight loss advice based on the notion Christianity is the best diet ever. The theory and tips that made Thin Within so useful in its first incarnation are buried under an avalanche of quotes from the Christian Bible, and digging your way through is an exhausting task. The implication that Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Taoists, Pagans, atheists and everyone other than born-again Christians are excluded from the Hallidays' weight management paradise because they lack the requisite theology is simply offensive."
5,Life Changing,Its great especially if you join a small group! Sometimes I fall away but through Gods grace (that overflows) I am able to start anew. Thank you Judy!
4,Thin Within Review,Wonderful incorporation of the word of God into everyday living and weight loss...We can do all things through Christ which gives us the strength!
5,wonderful book!,"About 10 years ago I did a different ""weight loss"" book that was very similiar in ideas to this one. But over the years I gained the weight back and always felt such guilt over it. With this book it taught me that God forgives! That is what grace is all about. I've released some weight already, but more importantly I've realeased a lot of other things to God."
4,Losing weight,Very easy book to read. It is also very motivating. I have already lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks.
4,Easy to read with good activities,"This book has mostly the same concepts as the book, ""Get thin, stay thin"", by the same authors, but it is much easier to read and has many thought-provoking activities in it. Although, the format makes it feel a little more like a program than a new approach to life, which is the way it was presented in ""Get thin, stay thin""."
5,i like seeing a low number of stars,"the reason is some people have different tastes... sometimes i like music right off the bat and sometimes it takes me months of listening before i like others. the best cds i hae though are the ones i have to listen to for a while.lee burridge caught me off guard ... he is OUT there. his music is way OUT there. i like it a lot. and i liked it right off the bat because i like music that makes you wonder WTF is really going on here. the mixing is excellent and the track selection is very unlike any other compilation you will find. from what i have seen, bought and heard..."
5,Great Mix.,"I think that people either love this CD or hate it. I loved it from the moment I popped it into my CD changer and havent taken it out since. The tracks are incredibly varied, yet very well put together. A lot of breakbeat, acid house and just plain, cool tunes and unlike any other NuBreed ot GU releaseIf you are looking for some variety, check this disk out."
1,Not worth the Nu Breed label,"I am a devoted fan of Global Underground as well as the Nu Breed series. Yet, this final release is very disappointing. I listened to both CD's before coming to a final conclusion that this DJ does not deserve (at least for now) to be released under the Nu Breed label. The tracks are incongruent, emotionless, and downright messy. Perhaps it fits some other genre, but not the one underwich it is released."
3,sayco diverter stem,"I can only give this 3 stars because after about 2 weeks of use it began making a screeching noise when you filled water in the tub. Called Danco today and was asked to check to see if washer was tight. It was, but I found an o ring which had been pushed off its seat and figured that was making all the noise. Made a homemade tool to get it back in position and noise is gone. I expect it to be loosened again and noise will return. Danco said if it did happen to call and he would send another. I had purchased another one of these stems locally for the other bath and paid much more for it, and it has worked without a problem for at least 4 months. I guess this is just one of the flaws that come off the assembly line every so often."
4,Unexpected,"For those of us who live in the real world we know that there isn't always a happy ending and sometimes bad things happen, this is the movie for you. This movie features real world instances and raw human emotions that mega movies (""blockbusters"") don't have. A great film for anyone who likes movies about actual life instances."
5,One of the best films I've seen in a very long time,"This movie is not what I expected and what a nice surpirse!!! A long married couple attempting to reconnect by placing personal ads and going on blind dates. No schlocky humor or sight gags. A remake of a foreign film. Slow paced, rich in dialogue. Heartbreaking. Oh and I guess I never really thought about this before but Stanley Tucci... hot."
1,How to make a film as good as this (if not better),"1) Drink a lot of cough syrup.2) Watch the most stilted, dry, and pretentious French ""art films"" you can find.3) Hit yourself in the head with a small hammer. (Only once or twice - unless you want permanent damage.)4) Write script. Get good actors and make sure they NEVER act like people in the real world.5) Let the cameras roll.Et Voila!"
5,The Blind Date,This video (The Blind Date) was a very good quality movie and the story line was excellent. The timely manner of Amazon getting it to my when I ordered it was also amazing. thanks Amazon
5,Wonderful,"This book is a must have for any writer. Not just of mystery. The information inside is easy to understand, but very thorough. And the real life examples are interesting and a little creepy. I love the How dunit series."
5,A great book,"Its a great read, perfect for a writer or anyone who wants to read something that will intimidate others around them while the read it, it's a bit scientific but and might be off putting for some people but I just loved it."
4,Good History Lesson,"I had a hard time getting into this book...in fact, I never really did get pulled into it all the way, even toward the end.The story seemed a little dull, and I think the author could've made it a little more interesting, because the plot had sounded good when I first read the book description. However, the book description on the back of the book was a little deceptive when it said that the story ""simmers with daring, mystery, and romance."" In truth, there was actually very little of any of these things, and practically NO romance whatsoever.I DID like how the story told readers a lot about Pagans and their Wiccan religion, incorporating different rituals, chants, and the origin of Wicca into the story, and that is why I gave the book four stars. If you are interested in learning about religions, especially Wicca, this would be a good, informative book to read."
3,Standard fare,"Standard collection of public domain cartoons, mostly (if not completely) available elsewhere. Then again, why *not* buy this particular collection? There's nothing wrong with it."
5,To Love is to Live Life to the fullest.,"'Forever and the Night' brought clarity to 'For All Eternity' for me. Having experienced Ms. Millers writing for the first time with the 2nd. book first, I knew the 1st. book would take hold of me with the same desire and joy that 'For All Eternity' had done. The all consuming lovemaking between Aidan and Neely left you desiring a vampire lover more than the first one had. With the love and tenderness that wove through the deceptions, anger and pain, your heart felt the sorrow Aidan felt and the great desire to have his wish, dream and most difficult request fulfilled. This story also drew me closer to Maeve and Valerian and to an understanding of these beautiful creatures of the night. SC.SanDieg"
